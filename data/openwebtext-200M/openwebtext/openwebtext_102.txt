I ’m not currently using any functional languages like Haskell and Lisp , but I ’m certainly comfortable with them .
I ’m certainly no Haskell guru , but I ’m good enough to use higher - order functions , ADTs , monads , etc .
While I have a good grasp of functional programming concepts now , I had to travel a long , hard road to get to this point .
Picture if you will a programmer with a C - family background discovering Haskell for the first time .
He ’s heard some smart people talk about how cool it is , and it says right there on haskell.org that it will substantially boost your productivity , so he momentarily puts down his Java Enterprise Web Framework With a Really Long Name and starts reading a Haskell tutorial .
At first , everything goes well .
He ’s impressed by the fact that you do n’t have to constantly compile code to see the effects of your program .
But after using the REPL as a calculator for a few minutes , he decides to check out how you write Hello World .
This is where things start going downhill .
He notices that the chapter on I/O is tucked away in the Advanced section .
Curiously , he flips to it and discovers , not an explanation of console and file I/O , but a disscussion of type classes , monads , and the like .
He wonders if everything will make more sense if he just visits the appropriate chapters , but no luck ; Haskell looks like one big incomprehensible mess .
Our imperative programmer goes back to his Java Enterprise Framework , and that is the end of that .
It ’s very difficult for a programmer used to imperative programming to find a good Haskell tutorial , or a good tutorial on any other functional language for that matter .
It ’s not that they explain Haskell badly ; many of them explain it rather well .
It ’s just that they explain the wrong parts of Haskell .
Procedural programmers are more often interested in how to do I/O and create GUIs rather than in how to use Parsec or write monads .
This is one of the major barriers to adoption of the more esoteric languages ; lack of learning material for “ normal people ” .
To rectify this , I thought about how I would write a Haskell tutorial .
I figured I would start off with a discussion about how to use the REPL to develop simple functions , and to test programs .
From there , we would talk about how functions are side - effect free .
We might take a detour into recursion , and then go on to topics such as monads and type classes .
It would just be a Really Good Tutorial .
Then I realized something : in this great tutorial of mine , there were no sections on how to do I/O .
There was n’t even a Hello World program .
Therein lies the problem .
The only people who can write a Haskell tutorial are the people who know Haskell .
Ironically , someone who knows
Haskell wo n’t be able to write a tutorial for the average programmer .
They ’ll focus too much on the features that make Haskell cool , rather than how to do practical things with it ; which is just what the average programmer wants .
Haskell gurus have spent so much time in their theoretical wonderlands , they ’ve forgotten what it ’s like to be an outsider .
We really need a Haskell , or Lisp , or ML tutorial aimed at the rest of the world , not just at functional gurus .
Although I ’m certainly not going to write it ; I ’ve got my own projects to worry about .

There has been a lot of recent buzz about brain fit­ness .
A New York Times edi­to­r­i­al print­ed today states :
When test­ed five years lat­er , these par­tic­i­pants [ in a cog­ni­tive train­ing study ] had less of a decline in the skill they were trained in than did a con­trol group that received no cog­ni­tive train­ing .
The pay­off from men­tal exer­cise seemed far greater than we are accus­tomed to get­ting for phys­i­cal exer­cise — as if 10 work­outs at the gym were enough to keep you fit five years lat­er .
and
If fur­ther stud­ies show that men­tal exer­cis­es can improve every­day func­tion­ing , doc­tors may need to pre­scribe such train­ing , senior cen­ters may want to set up “ brain gyms , ” and aging Amer­i­cans would be wise to do brain - stretch­ing activ­i­ties .
For this pur­pose , even the Medicare pre­scrip­tion drug pro­gram , which crit­ics deem too con­fus­ing for many old­er peo­ple to nav­i­gate , could prove an unex­pect­ed bless­ing .
Spend 10 hours mas­ter­ing its intri­ca­cies today and you could be a lot sharp­er than your com­pa­tri­ots five years from now .
To read the com­plete , orig­i­nal study pub­lished in JAMA , read The Ben­e­fits of Brain Exercises / Brain Fit­ness .
IHRSA , the Inter­na­tion­al Health , Rac­quet & Sports­club Asso­ci­a­tion , print­ed this arti­cle on men­tal mus­cles with sug­ges­tions on how to add brain work­outs to your tra­di­tion­al phys­i­cal work­outs .
Essen­tial­ly , humans need both phys­i­cal and men­tal exer­cise for good brain health .
Sci­en­tif­ic Amer­i­can also wrote an arti­cle on Brain Gain : Men­tal Exer­cise Makes Elder­ly Minds More Fit .
One of the study co-authors is quot­ed as say­ing
“ To dri­ve this effect , you have to prac­tice things that you do n’t like or things you do n’t reg­u­lar­ly prac­tice , ” Mar­siske says .
“ We hope to find ways of mak­ing these train­ing pro­grams more wide­ly avail­able to peo­ple and begin to encour­age some­thing more like men­tal exer­cise . ”
As we have men­tioned before when talk­ing about key ingre­di­ents for a brain fit­ness pro­gram , you need : nov­el­ty , vari­ety , and stretch­ing prac­tice ( increas­ing chal­lenge over time ) .
Com­put­er­ized pro­grams do the best job of reli­ably meet­ing these cri­te­ria , but doing any­thing is bet­ter than doing noth­ing !

After the struggle against the recent pride parade in Jerusalem , ultra-Orthodox rabbis have marked their next target :
The tight lycra shirts and short skirts .
For this purpose , some of the most important rabbis are set to convene at a rally Saturday night in a bid to " safeguard modesty . "
Immodest Clothing J’lem : Bleach war against ‘ immodest ’ women Neta Sela Residents of haredi neighborhood claim attacks by religious fanatics battling against ‘ promiscuity ’ of clothing stores and shoppers ; victim : This is Bitul Torah .
Do n’t they have anything better to do than look at women and determine whether they are modest or not ?
J’lem : Bleach war against ‘ immodest ’ women
Last year , the limits of modesty were broken in the Orthodox community , when young Orthodox girls began visiting shopping malls and buying fashionable clothing from popular chain stores such as Castro and Zara – too fashionable if you ask the rabbis .
The rabbis say that their biggest enemy is the lycra blouse that clings to the bodies of these God fearing women and by so doing over emphasizes what is best left to modesty .
' Length of skirts shortened , blouses too tight '
The outcome , according to the outraged rabbis is that lust is rampant on the streets and the innocence of the children of Israel is being destroyed .
" The length of the skirts has been shortened , and the blouses have become too tight .
Many girls can be seen on the streets with the shape of their bras and breasts showing , ” one of the rabbis explained .
In order to fight the practice , several measures have been taken such as the burning of clothing stores and spraying bleach on passersby on Jerusalem ’s streets .
In contrast , seminary rabbis and administrators decided to have female students sign a new modesty regulations contract .
The contract would bind each student to wear extra thick stockings , a shirt long enough that even bending down would not rise above the skirt , a skirt that would completely cover the knees .
In addition , all lycra shirts would be prohibited .
In order to ensure that the public follow these regulations , top rabbis are expected to meet Saturday at the Tamir Hall in Jerusalem to clearly state the new regulations .
The last gathering of this scope to take place within the Orthodox community concerned cellular phones .
Let 's play a game of " Name That Representative "
In August of 1966 , a young Republican Congressman from Illinois gave a lengthy speech about the need for Congressional oversight over Vietnam war related contracts .
This congressman insisted that only " an investigating committee to be controlled by the minority , can assure vigorous investigation . . . "
By the way , the company that had obtained the contracts that this congressman railed against was Brown and Root - which later became Kellogg , Brown and Root , the subsidiary of Halliburton that is now the largest contractor in Iraq .

Ambush Mentality Drives New Military Technology
Third Generation tactics : " On the offense , the rule is not " close with and destroy " but " bypass and collapse . "
The goal is to penetrate deep into the enemy 's rear , by stealth or by force ( the Germans used a three - , not two - , element assault , and the largest element was the exploitation element ) , then roll up the enemy 's forward units from the flank and rear while overrunning his artillery , headquarters and supply dumps .
The same approach was used by the Panzer divisions ( pictured ) on the operational level , leading to vast encirclements of hundreds of thousands of Soviet troops on the Eastern Front in 1941 . "
by William S. Lind
UPI Commentator
Washington ( UPI ) April 20 , 2007
I recently received the following query from Jim McDonnell of Baton Rouge , La. : " Could you please explain what 's meant by the remark about U.S. forces being unable to fight battles of encirclement ?
Is it that there are too few of them in Afghanistan or are you saying that our forces are constitutionally incapable of that kind of operation ?
If the latter is the case , that would make a column all by itself . "
It would and it does .
The problem is not numbers but tactical repertoire , or lack thereof .
That deficiency in turn is a product -- like so much else -- of the American armed forces ' failure to transition from the Second Generation to the Third .
Second Generation tactics , like those of the First Generation , are linear .
In the attack the object is to push a line forward , and in the defense it is to hold a line .
As we saw in so many battles in and after World War I , the result is usually indecisive .
One side or the other ends up holding the ground , but the loser retires in reasonably good order to fight again another day .
Usually , achieving a decision , which means taking the enemy unit permanently out of play , requires one of two things , or both in combination : ambush or encirclement .
Modern , Third Generation tactics reflect an " ambush mentality , " and also usually aim for encirclement .
To that end , Third Generation tactics are sodomy tactics : the objective is to get in the other guy 's rear .
On the defense , that is accomplished by inviting the enemy to attack , letting him penetrate , and then launching a counterattack designed to encircle him , not push him back out .
This was the basis of the new , Third Generation German defensive tactics of 1917 , and also the German Army 's standard defense in World War II .
On the offense , the rule is not " close with and destroy " but " bypass and collapse . "
The goal is to penetrate deep into the enemy 's rear , by stealth or by force ( the Germans used a three - , not two - , element assault , and the largest element was the exploitation element ) , then roll up the enemy 's forward units from the flank and rear while overrunning his artillery , headquarters and supply dumps .
The same approach was used by the Panzer divisions on the operational level , leading to vast encirclements of hundreds of thousands of Soviet troops on the Eastern Front in 1941 .
The U.S. military today knows little or nothing of this .
It did attempt an operational encirclement of the Iraqi Republican Guard by 7th Corps in the First Gulf War , but that attempt failed because 7th Corps was too slow .
On the tactical level , most American units have only one tactic : bump into the enemy and call for fire .
The assumption is that America 's vast firepower will then annihilate the opponent , but that seldom happens .
Instead , he lives to fight again another day , like Osama bin Laden and his al - Qaida at Tora Bora in 2001 .
While the central problem here is conceptual -- sheer ignorance of Third Generation tactics -- there is a physical aspect to it as well .
On foot , American soldiers are loaded down with everything except the kitchen sink , and they will probably be required to carry that too as soon as it is digitized .
To use tactics of encirclement , you need to be at least as mobile as your enemy and preferably more so .
The kind of light infantry fighters we find ourselves up against in places such as Iraq and Afghanistan are just that , light .
They can move much faster on their feet than can our overburdened infantry .
The result is that they ambush us , then escape to do it again , over and over .
Flip - flops in the alley beat boots on the ground .
As the students in my seminar at Quantico discovered early in the year , the decisive break , both in tactics and in organizational culture , is not between the Third and Fourth Generations but between the Second and Third .
It is little short of criminal that the American military remains stuck in the Second Generation .
The Third Generation was fully developed in the German Army by 1918 , almost a century ago .
It costs little or nothing to make the transition .
To those who understand how the Pentagon works , that may be the crux of the problem .

There 's a place that
I can go
And tell my secrets to
In my room
\– The Beach Boys
What if we start with the idea that sex is good , bodies are beautiful and exhibitionism is a wonderfully exuberant way to celebrate life , love and the pursuit of pleasure ?
What if we take it a step further and admit that technology has opened the doors – and the windows , and the portcullises , and the skylights and the ventilation systems – to a surfeit of sexual expression and display ?
Is it really asking too much to suggest that employers stop worrying about how we perform in adult spaces and concentrate on how we perform our jobs instead ?
Apparently it is , for the nonce .
An Ohio teacher was fired last month after his private nude photos were posted online without his knowledge and then discovered by administrators .
In February , Michelle Manhart was demoted from Air Force staff sergeant to senior airman and then reassigned to the Iowa National Guard , simply for posing in Playboy without first obtaining the Air Force 's permission .
A New York
Post article about how online activities affect a job hunt cites an example of a manager who was fired after his bosses found his pictures on an erotic dating site .
Not because he was using company time to update his profile , but because " he showed extremely poor judgment by making such a personal matter public . "
It makes you wonder what the bosses were doing at the dating site .
I am so sick of the priggishness .
Tired of people making assumptions about a person based on their perceptions of the other 's sexuality – especially when they base those assumptions on the single dimension of online expression .
Flabbergasted at the assumption that if you participate in adult activity online , you must lack judgment , integrity or reliability .
Getting naked on the internet is an international pastime , not the whim of a handful of sex addicts .
Flashing your booty or treating yourself to an orgasm is hardly a sign that you are incapable of doing your job well , nor does it grant permission for others to dismiss your professional competence or authority .
And millions of sane , healthy , normal folks cannot resist the special lure of the internet , where you can be voyeur and exhibitionist at the same time .
Adult dating site Adult FriendFinder ( NSFW ) has almost 24 million members .
I 'm pretty sure at least one of them is a teacher , one who has no problem maintaining discipline in the classroom despite having sexual adventures outside of it .
NewbieNudes.com ( NSFW ) , an adult - social - networking community , has more than 1.1 million members who blog about sex , post explicit self - portraits and talk dirty in chat rooms .
And how many of Second Life 's 5.5 million or so residents are there for the food ?
If sexual expression disqualified us from our jobs , there would n't be anyone left to do the work .
Happily for me , the recent spate of firings does not seem to be curtailing our willingness to open up our sexuality online , although college students are learning that they should n't brag about illegal drug use or reveal their horrible spelling where prospective employers can see it .
Devan , who appeared in an explicit student film that was later sold for distribution – " it was an art statement about polyamory , and I was in fact dating all the girls I had sex with ( on camera ) " – says he does n't worry about anyone stumbling across him .
It 's a matter of " spreading sex- positive culture and enthusiasm , " he says .
Others who share his interests and goals about sex and expression realize that their adventures could quickly become disasters .
Yet they forge ahead anyway .
Eric and Katie Todd ( not their real names ) are a married couple who have decided to expand their relationship to include other lovers and to blog ( NSFW ) about the experiment .
They blur their faces in the photos and are careful not to identify themselves too specifically , but they admit to being " a bit terrified " about being " outed . "
" We both work in normal everyday businesses and this would be completely unexpected , " Eric says .
" And her parents would likely disown us . "
But he says it 's worth the risk .
" Not only has our sex life been better and felt more free , but I think we have better communication in the rest of our marriage , too .
Now that we have ' opened ' the marriage , neither of us feels a pressing need to run out and get laid by someone else , " he adds , treating the blog and the relationship experiment as inseparable , like so many online sexplorers do .
" It seems that the freedom is more important than the actual act . "
That seems like a good philosophy for us all to adopt – particularly those who wield power over others , like managers and administrators .
If you are following a person 's digital trail and you learn that they spend Saturdays submitting to a dominatrix and Sundays blogging about the relationship and posting photos of the interplay , what assumptions can you draw about that person 's professional skills ?
None .
It 's quite possible that a day of submission each week releases all the stress from the office and makes them an effective and productive employee .
It 's also quite possible that they are excellent cooks , loving parents , sensible drivers and terrible project managers .
Dismissing a candidate or an employee based on what you think ( or what you think you know ) about their sexuality deprives you of creative and intelligent employees .
And whatever consensual sexual activity – including publishing !
– they do on their own time and with their own equipment is truly none of your business .
Because if we 're starting with the premise that bodies and sex are good and beautiful , we do n't have to follow it with " and therefore we need to keep them secret . "
That 's like saying sex is dirty and shameful and therefore to be saved for your One True Love .
Or saying that something so sacred and intimate must be hidden – but you do n't see anyone trying to keep yoga or prayer in the closet .
I still believe that our pretenses of primness will give way before the rising tide of expression .
It might already be happening .
MSNBC 's sex columnist Brian Alexander reports that erotic art is becoming mainstream , with exhibitions and festivals popping up in cities all across the United States and Europe .
People are n't afraid to attend or to be seen attending , either – they march right up to the door and pay the admission fee .
And Kyle H. , who has appeared in amateur porn films " both with and without my face showing , " admits that he has had " a lot more problems with the fear of its causing repercussions than actual repercussions . "
If you do n't want to see someone you know naked or sexually engaged , stay out of the adult areas of the internet .
If you 're there , what right do you have to punish others for their participation ?
People have sex .
Some people have kinkier sex than others , depending on how you define " kinky . "
Some people like to share their sex lives with others in various ways and the internet is an effective platform for doing so .
Next up : Water is wet and San Francisco is foggy .
Now get back to work .

Huge Native American face on Google Earth Posted on Tuesday , October 24 2006 @ 18:26:38 CEST by Thomas De Maesschalck
Here 's another weird finding on Google Earth .
Somewhere in Alberta in Canada you can spot mountains or large hills that look like the face of an Indian .
It looks pretty real , even a lot more realistic than the face on Mars IMO .
It 's also pretty big , I used the measure tool in Google Earth to measure the size of the Native American 's forehead and its about 225 meters ( 0.14 miles ) long .
You can check it out in
You can check it out in Google Maps or just enter 50° 0'38.20 " N 110° 6'48.32 " W in Google Earth .

It bears signs that are claimed to resemble cuneiform writing .
It is a large stone vessel , resembling a libation bowl .
It is supposed to have been found in the 1950s by a farmer in the neighborhood of Tiwanaku .
It resides in a small museum in Calle Jaén , La Paz , Bolivia ; Museo de metales preciosos " Museo de Oro " . [ 1 ]

Have Archaeologists checked this out ?
Surely there are some in Canada .
Also it does not look Indian as much as African , which is even stranger .
The " earbud " is obviously a dig site of some sort , What is fascinating is that there is a recent (? ) road and the dig site is EXACTLY where the ear hole would be .

Second of all , yes we do have archeologists up here in Canada , you ignorant uneducated american , and before you ask , no we do n't live in igloos .
Third , yes it's in Canada but it would still be called a " native american " ( refer to insult above ) .
Had you made it past grade six , you would have discovered that The United States OF America , is actually part of a larger land mass called North AMERICA that 's been here far longer than the USA , hence the name NATIVE American .

Check out the evil looking Santa Clause with Reindeer antlers sticking out of his head not far from the indian at :
50°01'06.13 " N 110°08'37.95 " W
This will land right on his nose .
He is facing west and his eye is even red and evil looking and his antlers stick right out of his head to the west !

If you ever saw a real Native American Indain in the old photos here on earth before the greedy whites decided we were hethens , it was customary to wear ear pieces , what are now called earriings , not Ipods .
Take this as a warning of what we have been warning or what can become of earth if we do not take better care of her .
This is not the only natural Native
American Indian Monument ,
There is one that is wind blown in the top of a mountain in Red Rock Canyon that has been there since a tribe lived there many moons ago .
They thought if they could climb as high as they get to it , thier prayers would be answered .

Do n't sugar coat it , anonymous .
Tell us how you REALLY feel .
If American Globalists or Manifest Destinists or whatever y'all call yourselves these days really want to achieve Deep Integration , then you 're going to have to learn more about the country you wish to absorb .
You 're going to have to respect the people that live there , and convince them that there is a better reason for it than simply looking hungrily at their natural resources .
Unfortunately for you , your foreign policy has laid your agenda bare for all to see , so much so , that the benign transition you were hoping for , based on linked infrastructure , will now have to be bolstered by military intervention , which will culminate in a full on invasion in the fall of 2009 .

I do n't mind being called Indian ( as long as it is n't used in an abusive manner ) , and most of us do n't except the more outraged of the Native Population .
I 'm also living in the US so watch your mouth .
Not all of us voted for Bush and some of those who voted for him truely regret it .
Unfortunately Bush and I share some of the same ancestors ( Tashtassuck , Wessonsuim and Keshkechoo ) .
I resent your lumping all Americans into one group , but I also dislike the way our foreign policy is handled .
No matter who we elect , THE VOTERS DON " T HAVE ANY REAL CONTROL OVER OUR ELECTED OFFICIALS !
You want to talk about hostile takeover , look at our Native American past !

It does look like a face .
But should we ask ourselves , " What race of man is it ? "

The unusual thing about the " Face on Mars " is n't how " realistic " it is , it is the signs of apparent SYMMETRY ... of which this formation has none .
So , this should not be used as evidence that the Face on Mars is a natural formation .

Holy crap people , put it together , it 's farm country , look around there are more of them , and their 's a farm , therefore it 's a simple grain silo casting a shadow , no hole , no archeological dig , no missile silo , no tunnel to the centre of the earth .
And the mysterious formations that look like tire tracks .... ARE TIRE TRACKS !

Hence the " tunnel to the centre of the earth " comment moron .
Gone are the days when you could go to the internet for intelligent conversation , and insightful commentary !
90 % of the comments here focus on a simple , coincidental and obviously man-made form , but none provide any insight into the actual formation itself and whether or not it 's actually there or the precipitating result of a Google Earth employee 's boring day .
Who gives a crap if a man-made structure gives the appearance of an Ipod earphone in the ear of an immense human face carved out of the earth ?
IT " S AN IMMENSE HUMAN FACE CARVED OUT OF THE FACE OF THE EARTH !!!!

Indians that are facing a mound and then in a totally different area , I found a prancing deer on about 40 acres .. you can see these all in plane day .. I have an archeologist checking this out ... You have to use the google map and Map Tech .
The deer shape is right a long a regular highway in Central Wisconsin

My friend see's the deer shape and the other faces also ... I found these just by accident and no one knows of them yet ... The land owners will be notified if they are indeed land art from our past Indians .

Use Disqus to post new comments , the old comments are listed below .
When not producing reports about the state of software piracy in China , the Business Software Alliance ( BSA ) produces reports about the state of software piracy among children .
Their newest report is interesting because it claims that children ( ages 8 to 18 ) are now downloading significantly less music , movies , and software than they were only two years ago .
The study shows that 57 percent of all respondents said that they have never downloaded media from the Internet without paying for it , up from 40 percent in 2004 .
In every area that the study examined , there has been a sharp drop in the last two years .
Gaming downloads among children declined from 32 percent to 25 percent , movie downloads fell from 17 percent to 10 percent , and music downloads plummeted significantly , from 53 percent in 2004 to 32 percent today .
This sounds like great news all around for content creators , but there 's a fairly big hitch : downloading increases with age .
While most eight - year - olds do n't download music , for instance ( only nine percent do so ) , most 18 - year - olds do ( 52 percent ) .
The same trend can be seen in most categories , leading the BSA to argue that " as kids grow older , they begin to view cyberspace as a virtual ' wild , wild West ' . "
As with many BSA statistics , it 's not clear that these are truly representative of the total situation .
A recent report from research firm Big Champagne , for instance , found that P2P usage has doubled in the last two years , not declined .
As even the BSA admits , as kids grow older , they download much more material .
To argue that these statistics signal a " winning of the war " is a pretty tenuous claim , but it does provide some evidence that attitudes among the children are shifting .
The report 's fact sheet also shows that most kids care only about consequences , not whether their actions are right or wrong .
The greatest worry among those who download software and media is not guilt or getting in trouble with parents , but contracting a virus or spyware .
About 40 percent of kids , in fact , do n't believe that downloading such material is " always wrong . "
( Intriguingly , 16 percent of these same kids also do n't believe that plagiarizing text from Internet sources without credit is always wrong , which goes a long way toward explaining the rise in Internet plagiarism . )
So how is the BSA going to counter such attitudes among children ?
It is — seriously — going to employ a small weasel ( insert your own joke here ) .
" BSA also today launched a new website , www.cybertreehouse.com, designed exclusively for young people to learn about appropriate computer usage in a fun and informative way .
The site includes Garret the Ferret , BSA ?s cyber - champion mascot , leading kids through games and activities that illustrate smart cyber behavior . "
If you 'd like to see what your kids might be receiving , you can check out Garret 's copyright adventures in this brief comic that shows kids just how " uncool " copyright violations are .
By the way , if you did n't know that corporations could pay to get their message out to kids without going through you first , note that this comic was distributed as a " sponsored supplement " to Weekly Reader that your child may well have received at school .

At the end , just 300 men stood between victory and the collapse of Western civilisation .
It was the summer of 480BC .
The Persian invasion force under Great King Xerxes had swept down from the north to the narrow , rocky pass of Thermopylae in central Greece , where a makeshift Greek army fearfully awaited them .
If the barbarian hordes , numbering more than 100,000 men , overran these defenders , Greek democracy and civilisation would fall prey to alien forces whose cruelty was a byword .
Most of the Greek defenders accepted they would fight bravely then retreat in good order , surviving to fight another day .
But the loyal Spartans spearheading this ragtag Greek force were different .
Their courage and self - sacrifice would ensure that this would become one of the bloodiest and most influential battles of the ancient world .
The 300 Spartan warriors , young men who had been trained for a single purpose in life - to fight and kill their many enemies - were silent and intent .
On the eve of battle they stripped naked and oiled themselves lovingly , combing their very long black hair , as if death was a goddess to be propitiated .
Each man had written his name on a chip of wood and tied it to his arm , so his corpse could be identified .
They had waited for such a task as this since their childhood .
Only the Spartans who had excelled in their boyhood training were chosen to serve as knights in the king 's bodyguard .
These knights , the 300 " champions " , were
selected for the battle of Thermopylae because they all had sons , so their family line would not die out if they were slaughtered .
The commander - in - chief of this extraordinary force was one of the two kings of Sparta , King Leonidas .
When his wife asked what she should do as he departed for the fight , he replied with typical Spartan terseness : " Marry a good man and bear good children . "
For the first two days of the threeday battle , the Persians could not make any progress .
The pass at Thermopylae , between the mountain and the sea , was barely the width of two wagons and the Spartans and Greeks held them off .
But on the third day , a Greek traitor showed the Persians another path , which enabled them to come round behind and encircle the Greeks .
Over their dawn meal , Leonidas told the Spartans sombrely : " This evening we shall dine in Hades . "
He poured a libation to the gods and ordered his troops to advance , all of them knowing it would be their last day on earth .
When he was killed , his men fought on with redoubled fury under the Persian arrows , as much to defend the fallen body of their King from the savagery of the barbarians as to show their valour .
According to the historian Herodotus , the enraged Spartans slaughtered the Persians in heaps .
Some drowned in the sea , others were trampled to death as their own officers forced them on into the bloody fray with whips .
" The Spartans , reckless with their own safety and desperate , since they knew their destruction was nigh at hand , exerted themselves with the most furious valour against the barbarians , " wrote Herodotus .
In the press of bodies , blinded by dust , the Spartans ' spears broke and their shields and swords were battered out of their hands .
Yet they continued fighting , grappling the Persians , choking them and biting them with their teeth .
But in the end , the outcome was inevitable .
Out of the 300 , just one of them survived .
The Persians may have won the battle but Thermopylae boosted Greek morale so strongly that they were able to drive them out of Greece the following year .
Civilisation was saved .
From that time on , the behaviour of the 300 has gone down in history as a model of courage in adversity .
It has inspired poets , artists and orators down the centuries , and films too , of which the latest , called simply 300 , is released later this month .
Yet the mystery is that it emerged out of one of the strangest social systems the world has ever known - a system even more controlled and militaristic than Germany 's Third Reich , yet where homosexuality was the norm and where women were the most scandalously liberated in the whole of Greece .
While Athens was the cradle of democracy , Sparta , 100 miles to the south - west , could have been on a different planet .
Athens , the commercial and cultural centre of Greece , was an outwardlooking , civilised society where political decisions were made with popular assent .
While Sparta was ruled by a warrior elite and served by a population of slaves .
Like Nazi Germany , it used constant indoctrination from an early age to enforce its totalitarian rule , and spies and secret police to create a climate of fear .
Like the Nazis , it killed the mentally and physically disabled , and half - breeds - the children of Spartan mothers and non-Spartan fathers .
A deeply xenophobic state , it focused on self - preservation and the domination of other Greek city - states .
It occupied the two nearest it and turned their inhabitants into " helots " , or serfs , who provided a labour - force on which Sparta depended : they were the worker ants .
The helots , strictly speaking , were captives of war .
Each year Sparta 's rulers made a phoney declaration of war on them , both to remind them of their servile status and to ensure that helots could be killed without legal repercussions .
There were seven times more helots than Spartans , and the militarism of Spartan society was founded on the need to keep them in their place .
As domestic servants , they prepared and cooked the food , made clothes , did the housework and looked after the children .
In wartime they provided run -of - the - mill troops for battle .
Helots worked the fields and performed all manual tasks .
Male Spartans were forbidden any profession , trade or business except the business of war .
A uniquely professional and motivated fighting force , they were the SAS of the Greek world .
Their toughness was honed in an educational system unmatched in the West until the Hitler Youth organisation .
New - born Spartan males were formally examined for any physical deformities .
If any were found , they were carried to a nearby gorge and left out in the sun to die of exposure .
Babies who passed this test were taken from their mothers at the age of seven and inducted into a compulsory communal education system - a training which would last them all their lives .
Between the ages of seven and 18 , young Spartans were divided into packs and forced to live off the land , stealing their food .
They were made to train outdoors , to sleep on hard pallet beds in the open and to travel silently at night .
Truly , it was a Spartan existence .
The toughest Spartans organised the packs and literally whipped the boys into shape .
They learned to rely solely on themselves and their companions .
Meanwhile the boys were made to break all links with their parents and regard their pack as family .
This surrogate fathering encouraged a system of ritual pederasty .
After the age of 12 , every Spartan adolescent was expected to receive a young adult warrior as his lover .
It would have been a mark of shame for a teenager not to have been courted by an older youth .
The relationship was not purely sexual .
The senior partner was expected to coach his protege and even to take the punishment if , for example , his young novice was cowardly enough to cry out during one of the many ordeals of his training .
The Spartans believed that homosexual relations encouraged solidarity on the battlefield .
The most promising teenage Spartans were enrolled in the Crypteia - literally , Secret Operations .
As in Nazi Germany , where the Gestapo habitually terrorised ordinary citizens , the Crypteia formed a secret police force , which
gathered intelligence , murdered troublemaking helots and spread terror among the rest as a form of control .
Crypteia members in their midteens were sent out into the countryside , armed only with a dagger , on helot - hunting expeditions .
They were required to " blood " themselves by killing a helot , preferably one who was a known troublemaker .
At the age of 20 , these young warriors were elected to the equivalent of regimental messes , where they would live until they were married - yes , eventually , they were introduced to women - and where they would dine every day for the rest of their soldierly lives .
The mess was a sort of social club for the warrior elite , although a frugal one .
The Spartans believed in austerity and self - denial .
The principle fare was black bean soup , a vile concoction of boiled pig's blood with vinegar that led foreigners to joke that they could understand why the Spartans were so indifferent towards death .
In some respects , though , Sparta was more advanced than Athens and other city - states .
Women lived a much freer life than anywhere else in ancient Greece .
Unlike other women , they were active and prominent in public life .
They could own land and property .
And although segregated from the boys , they were well educated and could read and write .
As part of their syllabus , the girls would gather at the river for ecstatic ritual dances known as " ambrosial nights " .
These were unbuttoned occasions , with wild songs about the pleasures of " limb - loosening desire " where the girls would sing of being " ridden like horses " and " exhausted by love " .
Oiled from head to toe , they danced , ran races , threw the javelin , wrestled and performed gymnastics - all completely naked and in the open , to the consternation of visitors .
The Spartans , typically , saw these exercises as preparing them to be the mothers of fit , healthy children .
The women had a reputation for beauty - Helen of Troy was a Spartan - and also for being sexually independent .
Freed from housework - their helot servants did all that - they formed liaisons with other women as well as available men and Sparta gained a reputation for enthusiastic lesbianism .
Yet they could be formidable .
" With your shield , or on it ! " was one Spartan woman 's farewell to her warrior husband .
That is : Come home a hero or die as one .
There was constant pressure to maintain the stock of male Spartan warriors because the level set for them was so high , so there were benefits for fathers with three or more sons and no laws against adultery .
Marriage ceremonies began with a symbolic rape : the bride was seized and carried off to the marital home where she was made ready for a groom , who'd had sexual relations only with other men .
Her hair was close - cropped ; she was dressed in a belted shift like a soldier 's tunic and then placed in an ill - lit room , so that she might almost pass for a man when her husband came to her .
Just as motherhood was the beall and end - all for Spartan women , so were martial arts for the men .
After the battle of Thermopylae , the Spartans spent most of the next 120 years at war , a period which saw the Spartans win dominion over most of Greece , before overreaching themselves and being brought to their knees by forces outside and within .
Sparta 's astonishing military successes depended on tactics which aroused terror in its enemies .
As Paul Cartledge tells us in his history of the Spartans , their heavilyarmedfootsoldiers used eight - deep shield walls moving in perfect step , like Panzer tanks , to bulldoze the enemy off the field of battle .
With their huge three - feet - wide shields overlapping , each soldier was protected , from his chin down to his knees , thus freeing his right hand to thrust a spear or a sword .
Armour on the legs , metal helmets and padded linen breastplates gave the soldiers added body protection .
No cavalry on earth could charge down this close - packed line of armoured infantry as long as it stood firm ; nor could the Persian archers have any effect on so much metal armour .
In the battle of Plataea , where they threw the Persians out , these Spartan formations broke right through to the enemy stockade and massacred everyone in sight .
Never again would a Persian army invade the Greek mainland .
Even their religion was put to martial use .
Spartans used linedancing , not only to honour their gods , but also as training in the rhythm and cohesion needed by soldiers fighting in phalanx formation .
Athletics was another form of religious and military expression .
What became the first all - Greek Olympic Games was first established in Sparta in 776 BC .
The Romans admired the example of Spartans so much that they liked to believe they were related to them .
Certainly , the collapse of Sparta resembled the downfall of Rome .
It had several causes .
Sparta 's last powerful king , Agesilaus , brought back so much booty from his Asian expeditions that the Spartans began to lose their habits of austerity and became self - satisfied .
Sparta thought itself unconquerable , without realising that there was such a small complement of paid - up Spartan warriors left that a helot uprising could pose problems .
A brilliant general from neighbouring
Thebes then defeated the Spartans at the battle of Leuctra , and when the helots rose up against their masters , Sparta 's days of glory were numbered .
In the historical record , it remains as both an inspiration and a warning .
Sparta 's evolution from a handful of villages in the southern Peloponnese to the most powerful fighting force in the ancient Greek world , through amazing feats of arms , resounds through the ages .
Yet its repressive society was too close to modern dictatorships to deserve our unalloyed admiration .
It was a totalitarian regime , dependent on slave labour , which indoctrinated its young into an acceptance of state terror .
And inevitably the slaves eventually took their revenge .
Lately , I ’ve seen a couple of attempts of large standards organizations to migrate in some way or another to the more community - driven specification creation model demonstrated by the FOAF and GeoRSS communities .
I think that these communities are a great model of the right way to create application - level specifications , but I do n’t think that large standards orgs are going to find it possible to migrate to this framework without a very significant change in the way they look at what they do .
Community based standard creation offers a great number of benefits .
Without a large corporation behind the specification , it seems to have been possible to create an environment where the ‘ survival of the fittest ’ in terms of inclusion into the spec is much more likely than in a case where large competing interests do n’t have any impetuous to create a small specification .
This environment is likely created by the specification creators being implementors .
Implementors are more likely to head to the simplest thing that could possibly work .
Implementors care about how difficult a spec is to understand , because if they do n’t understand it , they ca n’t implement it .
Large corporations do n’t have the same feeling .
A representative of Sun , IBM , HP is going to try to solve a lot more cases than he or she will personally implement :
The reason for this is that in those large organizations , a specification will be used by dozens or hundreds of different implementors , to solve different goals .
This is great when the result is a specification which is well suited to all of those needs — however , typically what happens is that a specification grows in complexity with each additional use case .
You end up with a large specification which can be used to solve lots of different needs , but does n’t solve any of them perfectly , and is difficult to implement — or at least to understand how to implement — due to the added complexity of addressing dozens , or more , of use cases rather than a single simple case .
The single representative of a large organization is going to be speaking as a representative of far more people than a single use case .
There are certain specifications which are better built this way .
The fact that so many people have spent time thinking about XML has resulted in a format which is extremely flexible , and can play the roles needed in thousands of applications .
The specification has been around long enough that tools which understand XML are very mature , and this maturity makes XML a useful tool for information exchange among a wide number of tools .
I think an implementor of a new toolkit to work with XML would , however , argue that XML is not easy at all : there are many edge cases which need to be handled , and the fact that these tools are already created hides these complexities .
Application - level specifications are not well - suited for large - organization standardization .
Application - level specifications should start by addressing the simplest thing that could possibly work .
Large organizations do n’t have an interest in creating the simplest thing that could possibly work .
Starting small and expanding into something larger is a pathway that large standards bodies have thus far successfully demonstrated the ability to do .
It is possible that someplace like the W3C could succeed at this , but it would require changing the way these standards are generally created .
* Open communication .
Even in the Geospatial Incubator group , the primary communications channels are currently closed : private mailing lists , private telecons , and private wikis .
Implementors have not been invited to participate .
This is a large mistake : standards for application use need to involve applications .
There are a number of applications developers who would love to take part in standards development who have not yet been afforded the opportunity to .
* Changing development strategy .
Rather than spending months going through 17 calls for comments , last calls , etc. to get to a recommendation , get something out as quickly as possible and iterate on it .
* Require that a specification have implementations before it is complete .
I ’m still not aware of a good , W3C released or endorsed XML parser .
No tools to convert some existing data format to any kind of XML .
No way to test how the specification is supposed to work and make sure you ’ve got it right .
Conformance testing is a good part of this , but is not all of it .
When working on RSS 1.1 , we had an implementation for WordPress and support for XML :: Parser patched in Perl before we even released the spec .
We included testing , Relax - NG testing , and a validator service .
All of these and more were important to the rapid ( though limited ) uptake the technology received : no one had any serious questions about RSS 1.1 that could n’t be answered by reading through the example implementations .
These changes , however , are antithetical to the way that large standards organizations work .
In general , grassroots implementors are n’t part of large organizations which can afford to be members of these standards organizations , or when they are , they are n’t often implementing these standards as part of their work for that company .
Since large standards organizations depend on large corporations memberships for revenue , choosing to allow small - potatoes implementors participate means that they give up possible revenue stream .
When this happens , the larger customers start wondering what the benefit there is to being a member : if anyone can just come in on their own time and influence the standard , what is the benefit to pay large sums of money to participate ?
Part of the reason for this shift is that organizational costs for creating standards have been headed downward .
For $ 500 / yr , or less , I can get my own webserver with lots of bandwidth .
I can run mailing lists , Web pages , Wikis , IRC channels .
With VoIP setups , I can achieve relatively cheap realtime communication , and the grassroots standards developers typically have more of a preference for somewhat real - time online communication anyway .
When I can obtain all the organizational materials I need to create a standard for less than $ 500 / yr , what purpose does a $ 50,000 a year membership to a standards org get me ?
Typically , the answer is “ Access to the right people ” .
Getting the members of the RDF developer community in the same place for discussions is not easy , and doing it with telecons does take work .
However , as the grassroots development practices mature , they are demonstrating the ability to create specifications in ways that do not work the same way as XML was developed .
Good specifications limit the need for specification ‘ marketing ’ — if a spec does what you need , you ’ll find it , and you ’ll use it , if it ’s good .
So , with organizational costs heading downwards far enough that people are willing to contribute the resources out of pocket , with developers tending to group together without the need of an organizational support , and with the resulting specification having the support of application implementors , what do standards organizations offer to application specification development ?
I think you can guess what I think the answer to that is .
He spent something like $ 100 million on his Japanese - style mansion in Woodside , Calif. , making it among the more expensive private residences ever built .
But that is only about three weeks worth of the interest he earns on his wealth .
And a house does n’t actually spend down his net worth because it is an asset that can be resold .
At least part of the $ 100 million is just a different way of saving .
Mr. Ellison would have to spend that $ 30 million a week — $ 183,000 an hour — on things that ca n’t be resold , like parties or meals , just to avoid increasing his wealth .
While somebody might be able to spend like that — Paris Hilton , maybe — it certainly would n’t be easy , and it ca n’t explain why the super - rich accumulate .
The last of the seemingly rational explanations is that the billionaires want to pass it on to their children .
But , again , their fortunes are growing far faster than their number of heirs , so each of the children will have the same problems spending the money that their parents had .
Sam Walton ’s fortune is now divided among his family , and the Forbes list will probably show that his children account for 4 of the 10 richest Americans in the world ( with his wife being No. 11 ) .
The children are in their 50s and 60s , and if they live to be 80 , and their wealth grows at 10 percent a year , their fortunes will rise by four to eight times and they will each have more than they can ever spend or their children can spend , and so on .
Further , the data , according to Professor Carroll , just does n’t indicate that children make much of a difference .
He found in the government ’s 1992 Survey of Consumer Finances , for example , that only 4 percent of the richest Americans said that providing an inheritance ranked in their top five reasons for saving .
On top of that , he says , the data shows that elderly super - rich people who do not have children save just as much as the ones who do .
If it is n’t to spend , to give to their children , or to give to charity , then why do the rich save so much ?
Professor Carroll says maybe they love money , not for what it can buy but just for its own sake .
Perhaps they get something different from having money — clout , power , the ability to dominate an industry .
Or perhaps these are just competitive people who care about their position compared with other people on the list .
They accumulate more so they can lord it over the other families who have less — a bit like having enough nuclear weapons to blow up the world several times but making more to stay ahead of the other guy .
However you look at it , though , it is n’t for the reasons that everyone else saves money .
In a few weeks , you will see the list of the world ’s wealthiest people and how vastly their wealth has increased .
Warren Buffett will probably be the only one pledging to give his fortune away .
The other billionaires will probably think he ’s crazy , but it may make him the most rational person on the list .
Some of Guantanamo's inmates have been held for five years
Amnesty International said the often harsh and inhumane conditions at the camp were " pushing people to the edge " .
It called for the facility to be closed and for plans for " unfair " military commission trials to be abandoned .
Many of the 385 inmates have been held for five years or more , unable to mount a legal challenge to their detention .
" While the United States has an obligation to protect its citizens ... that does not relieve the United States from its responsibilities to comply with human rights , " the report said .
Some [ inmates ] are dangerously close to full - blown mental and physical breakdown
UK director Kate Allen
Amnesty International
" Statements by the Bush administration that these men are ' enemy combatants , ' ' terrorists ' or ' very bad people ' do not justify the complete lack of due process rights , " the group said .
Amnesty reiterated its call for detainees at the prison camp in Cuba - many of whom are suspected Taleban and al - Qaeda fighters - to be released or charged and sent to trial .
' Already in despair '
The report , published on Thursday , said about 300 detainees are now being held at a new facility - known as Camp 5 , Camp 6 and Camp Echo - comparable to " super- max " high security units in the US .
The US says it plans to prosecute 80 of the 385 remaining inmates
It said the detainees were reportedly confined to windowless cells for 22 hours a day , only allowed to exercise at night and could go for days without seeing daylight .
The organisation 's UK director , Kate Allen , described the process at Guantanamo as " a travesty of justice " .
" With many prisoners already in despair at being held in indefinite detention ... some are dangerously close to full - blown mental and physical breakdown .
" The US authorities should immediately stop pushing people to the edge with extreme isolation techniques and allow proper access for independent medical experts and human rights groups . "
' Serving justice '
The provision that stripped detainees of their right to mount a legal challenge to their confinement was upheld by a US federal appeals court in Washington in February .
Pushing the anti-terror legislation through Congress last year , Mr Bush said he needed the new law to bring terror suspects to justice .
It allows for the indefinite detention of people as " enemy combatants " .
The US has said it plans to use the military tribunal system to prosecute about 80 of 385 prisoners remaining at the camp .

" Hooker for Jesus ! " – Drawing from Family publication Flirty Fishing –– Drawing from Family publication
Flirty Fishing
Flirty Fishing ( FFing ) was a form of religious prostitution practiced by the Children of God / The Family cult from 1974 until it was officially discontinued in 1987 ( due , in part , to the AIDS scare ) .
Its etymology can be traced to Matthew 4:19 where Jesus says " Follow me , and I will make you fishers of men . "
Flirty Fishing was a subset of The Family 's love bombing activities and involved the use of sexual attraction and intercourse to win converts and favors .
Female members were told to be " God 's whores " and " hookers for Jesus " , and soon after its launch as a method of witnessing , sex was given to complete strangers in combination with a request for a " donation " , or for a required fee in line with Escort Servicing ( ESing ) or freelance ESing .
FFing and prostitution was widely used as a way to raise money for the cult and resulted in many of the second generation births ( known as " Jesus Babies " ) .
Internal Family records from 1988 indicate that over 223,000 " fish " were loved sexually between 1978 and 1988 .
The Family describes the practice of Flirty Fishing as follows :
In the latter part of the '70s and early ' 80s , [ David Berg ] , responding in part to the sexual liberality of that time period , presented the possibility of trying out a more personal and intimate form of witnessing which became known as ' Flirty Fishing ' or ' FFing ' .
In his Letters at that time , he offered the challenging proposal that since ' God is Love ' ( 1 John 4:8 ) , and His Son , Jesus , is the physical manifestation and embodiment of God 's Love for humanity , then we as Christian recipients of that Love are in turn responsible to be living samples to others of God 's great all - encompassing Love .
Taking the Apostle Paul 's writings literally , that saved Christians are ' dead to the Law [ of Moses ] ' ( Romans 7:4 ) , through faith in Jesus , [ Berg ] arrived at the rather shocking conclusion that Christians were therefore free through God 's grace to go to great lengths to show the Love of God to others , even as far as meeting their sexual needs .
In The Family 's internal FF Report Questions & Answers ! ( PDF ) , the following description is given :
Q : " What is FF'ing ? "
Many of you asked for a definition and what should be reported as actual FF'ing .
A : We would like to answer that FF'ing is going out witnessing the love of Jesus with the serious intent to use sex or sex appeal as the bait , regardless of the situation or place .
This can be anywhere !
–On the street , in a park , while going to the local store , in discotheques or in clubs !
Q : Does " Loved Sexually " also include kissing and light petting ?
A : We suggest you only include masturbation , sucking and actual intercourse in the figures of fish , mate , brother or sister loved sexually .
It 's all , or nothing at all !
Hallelujah !
In 1995 , after extensive research of Family publications and receiving testimony from numerous witnesses , the Right Hon. Lord Justice Sir Alan Ward stated the following about FFing in his judgment of a child - custody trial involving the Family in England :
I am quite satisfied that most of the women who engaged in this activity and the subsequent refinement of ESing , ( which was finding men through escort agencies ) , did so in the belief that they were spreading God 's word .
But I am also totally satisfied that that was not Berg 's only purpose .
He and his organization had another and more sordid reason .
They were procuring women to become common prostitutes .
They were knowingly living in part on the earnings of prostitution .
That was criminal activity .
Their attempts to deny this must be dismissed as cant and hypocrisy .
To deny that the girls were acting as prostitutes because " we are not charging but we expect people to show their thanks and their appreciation and they ought to give more for love than if we charged them " is an unacceptable form of special pleading .
The " FFers handbook " told the girls that fishing could be fun but fun did not pay the bills .
" You 've got to catch a few to make the fun pay for itself .
So do n't do it for nothing . "
Discontinuation
In a trend seen througout the globe , the advent of AIDS wrought changes in the perceptions of the merit of " free sex " .
The threat of sexually transmitted diseases was the anti-thesis to the gratuitous sexual lifestyle and The Family was compelled to curtail Flirty Fishing in 1987 and all sex with Systemites ( non-members ) during this same period for multiple reasons .
Coinciding with increased scrutiny of The Family 's sexual practices the cult elected to reduce sexual contact with outsiders and reinvent their image to the outside world by shedding the " free sex " image from their hippie past in favor of a more conservative and current image , seeing the AIDS epidemic as a good time to do so .
While this marked a historic juncture in The Family 's sexual disclosure to the outside world , it reduced promiscuity within The Family only insofar as to seek to contain contagion .
The following explanation of Flirty Fishing 's discontinuation is given on the official Family website :
In 1987 the Family discontinued FFing to emphasize other means of ministering the Word of God to others , as well as to take advantage of opportunities to reach more people than the very personalized ministry of FFing allowed .
At that time as well , the plague of AIDS had begun its rampage through the world — another indication that it was time to reconsider Family policy of allowing sexual interaction outside our communities .
Although we no longer practice FFing , we believe the scriptural principles behind the ministry remain sound .

Flirty Fishing and the second generation
Flirty Fishing was responsible for a significant number of childbirths in The Family .
Children born as a result of Flirty Fishing were called " Jesus Babies " .
The Family used a comic book called " Life with Grandpa - Real Fathers " , among other publications , to explain some associated issues to the second generation .

Mouseover DOM Inspector v2.0.2 Help
Overview
The Mouseover DOM Inspector , or MODI for short , is a favelet ( also known as a bookmarklet ) that allows you to view and manipulate the DOM of a web page simply by mousing around the document .
Browsers currently supported are Firefox , Mozilla , Netscape 8 , Opera 7.5 + and MSIE6 + on all of their respective Operating Systems .
To begin using the Mouseover DOM Inpsector , simply add the following link to your bookmarks by right clicking and selecting " Add to Favorites " or " Bookmark this Link " or whatever the nomanclature of your browser of choice .
Bookmark this link for MODIv2
Should you encounter problems with this software , please contact me and let me know the URL you were on , the browser and operating system , if you are using a preference file along with the url to that preference file and as detailed a description as you can with what you were doing when the problem occured .
Suggestions for improvement and functionality enhancements are also welcome .
If you are looking for the older version of MODI ( v1.5 ) you 'll find it here .
Keyboard Commands
1 Snaps the Data Window back to the top - left corner of the browser window , taking the vertical scroll amount into account .
Also places the favelet back into Freeze Mode .
A Clone the currently highlighted object and its children .
Use the " S " key to append it to another object .
B Cycle hightlighting preference .
Gray backgrounds , red outlines and none .
MSIE does not support the outline property , so this will toggle backgrounds in that browser .
C Apply a random background color to the element .
Hitting " C " again will restore the original color .
D Toggle the visibility of the Data Window , displaying the element type and id / class if found in the " title " attribute of the element .
E Toggle object width from auto ( fluid ) to its original width .
F Toggle Freeze Mode .
The favelet will remain active , but the Data Window will not follow the cursor .
This is the default startup mode for the favelet .
G
Toggle the visibility of all the data lists .
H
Hide the currently selected element .
J
Show all elements hidden with the " H " command .
K Remove all element labels from the page .
L Label the element with its tag name .
Clicking the label removes it from the document .
O Outline the element with a red border .
MSIE6 does not support this style property .
P Pause the favelet .
This will disable the favelet without turning it off .
R Remove the current element from the DOM .
S Append a cloned object to the currently highlighted object .
Use the " A " key to clone an object .
T Begining at the HTML element , manually step through the DOM , including non-display elements like META and TITLE U Toggle " Always Transparent " mode .
When on , the data window will remain at 60 % transparency ( or a value specified by you in your external preference file . )
Not available in Opera .
V View and edit the HTML source of the current element .
You may use this to view the HTML of an element on sites serving their content as application / xhtml+xml , but you may not modify it .
W Select the parent of the current element .
This will allow you to step up through the DOM to the HTML element .
ESC Exit the Favelet / Cancel Edit Mode ENTER
Apply changes in Edit Mode
Additional Functionality
Freeze Mode
The new default mode for the favelet , Freeze Mode , places the data window at 10,10 ( the upper left corner of the screen ) and prevents it from following the mouse cursor .
This mode can be toggled with the " F " key to cause the data window to follow the cursor like v1.x Parent Node Highlights
When the favelet is in Freeze mode ( " F " key ) or Pause mode ( " P " key ) , you can mouse over the list of elements that make up the Parent Structure of the current element to highlight those elements .
Child Node Highlights
Works exactly the same way as with Parent Node Highlights .
Only element nodes are highlighted , but all node types are displayed .
If the element is a text node , its node value will be displayed as the title attribute of the list item .
No Object Notification
Since the favelet does not highlight the BODY or HTML elements when in mouse - over mode , it is possible that no element is highlighted .
In these cases , the data window will become transparent .
Not available in Opera .
Window Drag
When paused ( " P " ) or in frozen ( " F " ) , the Data Window can be moved by clicking and dragging from the title bar containing the element name .
Pause for Input Focus
In order to allow for interaction with inputs and textareas on the document , the favelet will go into Pause Mode when one of these element types recieve focus .
To unpause , simply click away from the input element , or hit the " P " key .
Thanks to Simon for the suggestion .
Highlight Indicator Cycling through the highlight modes with the " B " key will change the Highlight Indicator in the top right corner of the data window to reflect the current highlight mode .
A solid gray square indicates gray background highlights , a square with a red border indicates red outlines and the absence of an icon indicates no highlights .
Edit Mode
In edit mode ( " V " key ) , in addition to the " Cancel " and " Apply " links , the " ESC " key will cancel , and the " ENTER " key will apply your changes .
If the site is served as application / xhtml+xml , both keys will close the edit window .
Collapsible Lists
The lists of data displayed in the the data window can be collapsed and expanded by clicking their headings .
For example , to collapse the " Attributes " list , click the " Attributes " heading .
All of the lists can be opened and closed at once with the " G " key .
Keep
In View
The data window will adjust its position to stay within the view port when you scroll vertically .
This does not apply when the Data Window is longer than the available vertical space in the browser , such as when an object with a long list of child nodes is highlighted .
Bugs ?
Find a bug ?
Please let me know about it .
Optional External Preference File

Cheney criticizes the Geneva Conventions in Military Academy commencement address Michael Roston
Published : Saturday May 26 , 2007 Print This Email This Vice President Dick Cheney criticized the notion of applying the Geneva Conventions to individuals captured in the course of the war on terrorism in a Saturday commencement address at the United States Military Academy in West Point , New York .
" Capture one of these killers , and he 'll be quick to demand the protections of the Geneva Convention and the Constitution of the United States , " the Vice President said in the Saturday morning speech .
" Yet when they wage attacks or take captives , their delicate sensibilities seem to fall away . "
Cheney delivered the remarks in the context of moral and ethical lessons that the graduating cadets at West Point had learned in the course of their study .
" You have lived by a code of honor , and internalized that code as West Point men and women always do , " he said .
" As Army officers on duty in the war on terror , you will now face enemies who oppose and despise everything you know to be right , every notion of upright conduct and character , and every belief you consider worth fighting for and living for . "
Recently , West Point instructors have complained of the difficulty of persuading Army cadets to adhere to the principles of the Geneva Conventions in the war on terrorism .
A February article in the New Yorker highlighted a dialog on the problem between West Point 's dean and Joel Surnow , producer of the hit Fox television program ' 24 . '
" This past November , U.S. Army Brigadier General Patrick Finnegan , the dean of the United States Military Academy at West Point , flew to Southern California to meet with the creative team behind ' 24 , ' " wrote Jane Mayer in the magazine .
" Finnegan , who is a lawyer , has for a number of years taught a course on the laws of war to West Point seniors - cadets who would soon be commanders in the battlefields of Iraq and Afghanistan .
He always tries , he said , to get his students to sort out not just what is legal but what is right .
However , it had become increasingly hard to convince some cadets that America had to respect the rule of law and human rights , even when terrorists did not .
One reason for the growing resistance , he suggested , was misperceptions spread by ' 24 , ' which was exceptionally popular with his students .
As he told me , ' The kids see it , and say , '' If torture is wrong , what about ' 24 ? ' ' "
The excerpt of Cheney 's remarks is presented below , and can be accessed in full at the White House website .
#
The standards of this Academy only highlight the deepest and most fundamental difference between the United States and our sworn enemies .
A month ago , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs , General Pace , spoke to this class about each officer 's duty to follow a moral compass in all of his or her actions .
In these four years you have learned the rules of warfare and professional military ethics .
You 've studied the tenets of morality .
You 've reflected on the seven Army values : of loyalty , duty , respect , selfless service , honor , integrity , and personal courage .
You have lived by a code of honor , and internalized that code as West Point men and women always do .
As Army officers on duty in the war on terror , you will now face enemies who oppose and despise everything you know to be right , every notion of upright conduct and character , and every belief you consider worth fighting for and living for .
Capture one of these killers , and he 'll be quick to demand the protections of the Geneva Convention and the Constitution of the United States .
Yet when they wage attacks or take captives , their delicate sensibilities seem to fall away .
These are men who glorify murder and suicide .
Their cruelty is not rebuked by human suffering , only fed by it .
They have given themselves to an ideology that rejects tolerance , denies freedom of conscience , and demands that women be pushed to the margins of society .
The terrorists are defined entirely by their hatreds , and they hate nothing more than the country you have volunteered to defend .
The terrorists know what they want and they will stop at nothing to get it .
By force and intimidation , they seek to impose a dictatorship of fear , under which every man , woman , and child lives in total obedience to their ideology .
Their ultimate goal is to establish a totalitarian empire , a caliphate , with Baghdad as its capital .
They view the world as a battlefield and they yearn to hit us again .
And now they have chosen to make Iraq the central front in their war against civilization .

Surprising as it might seem , programmers spend a majority of the time reading code , not writing code .
Take my case .
Even though I am working alone , on a new project , I spend the majority of my time reading code .
That 's not just my code , but also the code in the various open source modules that I 'm using .
At some point or the other , I 've had to delve headlong into the source of Django Mochikit and ToofPy , and try to make out what the code is doing by ignoring the docs ( if there are any ! ) and reading the source .
If you are working in a team , the effect is magnified even more .
This was no sudden revelation .
When I was hiring , I had a standard question to see if candidates could read code .
Here is the code snippet .
Candidates had to try to figure out what function f was doing .
First , I expected the candidate to see the left and right fields and guess that " a " was a pointer to a binary tree of some sort .
I then expected the candidate to see the pattern of the recursive calls and guess that it was a tree traversal ( inorder in this case ) .
Once that 's done , its simple to try out the function with some data and figure out what it does ( count the number of nodes ) .
Given that everyone learns about binary trees , and especially inorder traversal , you would have expected many to get it right .
Surprise !
Only a few have ever got it correct .
Most answers were something related to linked lists or arrays .
It seemed that every programmer when confronted with a pointer in any form assumed it was related to linked lists !!
To be successful at code reading , it is the ability to execute the program in our mind that needs to be developed .
This is a learned skill , developed by just reading lots of code .
One conclusion is that many programmers do n't spend enough time reading code .
It also explains why in many teams , most code becomes spaghetti — programmers can't read the original code , so they hack their fixes .
So , do you check to see if programmers can read code ?
As an aside , you can now find out how most programmers can't write code either
A number of secondary indicators are also taken into account , including activity by militias , problems with ineffective police , the ability of Iraqi officials to govern effectively , the number of civilians who have been forced to move by sectarian violence , the willingness of Iraqi security forces to follow orders , and the degree to which the Iraqi Kurds are pressing for independence from the central government .

Credit ... United States Central Command
These factors are evaluated to create the index of civil strife , which has registered a steady worsening for months .
“ Ever since the February attack on the Shiite mosque in Samarra , it has been closer to the chaos side than the peace side , ” said a Central Command official who asked not to be identified because he was talking about classified information .
In the Oct. 18 brief , the index moved still another notch toward “ chaos . ”
That briefing was prepared three days before General Abizaid met in Washington with President Bush , Defense Secretary Donald H. Rumsfeld and Gen.
Peter Pace , the chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff , to take stock of the situation in Iraq .
A spokesman for the Central Command declined to comment on the index or other information in the slide .
“ We do n’t comment on secret material , ” the spokesman said .
One significant factor in the military ’s decision to move the scale toward “ chaos ” was the expanding activity by militias .
Another reason was the limitations of Iraqi government security forces , which despite years of training and equipping by the United States , are either ineffective or , in some cases , infiltrated by the very militias they are supposed to be combating .
The slide notes that “ ineffectual ” Iraqi police forces have been a significant problem , and cites as a concern sectarian conflicts between Iraqi security forces .
Other significant factors are in the political realm .
The slide notes that Iraq ’s political and religious leaders have lost some of their moderating influence over their constituents or adherents .
Federal agents are investigating reports that a college student tried to illegally hammer off the teeth of a rare sperm whale that washed ashore dead Sunday on a beach in Isla Vista near UC Santa Barbara .
“ I arrived and this guy had a hammer and was hammering away on the teeth , ” said Shane Anderson , supervisor of marine operations at the UC Santa Barbara Marine Laboratory .
“ I explained to him that there was a federal law against doing that and that the specimen was important for science .
He did n’t want to hear it . ”
Anderson told the student that if he did n’t stop , he was going to take his picture and report him .
The student then became so verbally abusive that a Santa Barbara County sheriff ’s deputy arrested him and cited him for public disturbance , Sheriff ’s Sgt. Erik Raney said .
David Harrison , 20 , a UC Santa Barbara student , was released on the spot after being issued a misdemeanor citation , Raney said .
Harrison , who lives in Isla Vista , could not be immediately reached for comment .

Joseph Cordaro , who coordinates marine mammal strandings for the National Marine Fisheries Service , said it was extraordinarily rare for a sperm whale to wash ashore in California .
The endangered whale typically remains far offshore , he said .
Unlike the large whales that have bristle - like baleen to strain plankton from seawater , sperm whales have large cone - shaped teeth which they use to hunt and eat squid at great depths .
Sperm whale teeth , which can be 8 inches in length and 3 inches in diameter , can sell for hundreds of dollars on the black market as raw teeth or carved or engraved into handiwork called scrimshaw .
Federal officials often prosecute such trafficking cases to discourage poaching of the whales , which are listed as endangered species .
Sperm whales are protected by the Endangered Species Act and the Marine Mammal Protection Act .
“ It ’s illegal to possess any part of any marine mammal without getting a permit from us , ” Cordaro said .
“ What that person was trying to do was an illegal act . ”

Roxanna Behtash , special agent with the National Marine Fisheries Service , confirmed that she has begun an investigation into the college student ’s alleged violation of the Marine Mammal Protection Act .
“ It ’s illegal for someone to go and yank the tooth out of a dead marine mammal , ” Behtash said .
“ It ’s illegal to possess or sell marine mammal parts of any kind , unless you have a permit . ”
She declined to elaborate on the investigation until the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ’s general counsel office determines what specific charge should be pursued and whether it should be handled as a civil or criminal case .
Biologists , meanwhile , were planning a beach necropsy to take tissue and skin samples to learn what they could about the whale ’s cause of death .
A team from the Santa Barbara Museum of Natural History was leading the effort as part of the national Marine Mammal Health and Stranding Response Program .
Typically , Cordaro said , the team will take a lower jaw and skin samples for DNA analysis .
He said the whale appeared to be a young male , not quite fully developed at 29 feet in length .
A mature male , he said , is usually about 32 feet long .
Sperm whales can grow as large as 60 feet and can live to be 80 years old .
Their population continues to recover from excessive whaling .

In this case , the teeth of the whale have been badly damaged , which could compromise the scientific value of removing the jaw , Anderson said .
He said the student was n’t very careful in trying to extract the teeth .
“ This kid was busting them all up with a hammer , ” Anderson said .
“ I guess he wanted them really bad . ”

At a parliamentary hearing of the Commission for National Security that was convened to hear complaints , “ Some of the members of Parliament complained that the security force should not put itself in a position to deal with such issues , ” said Dariush Ghanbari , a member of the commission .
When one woman , Nazanin , 28 , was stopped last month in Vanak Square , she thought she had dressed more modestly than usual , she said .
But she was told that her coat was tight and showed the shape of her body .
“ I just joked with them and tried to stay calm , but they told me to sit so that they could see how far my pants would pull up in a sitting position , ” said Nazanin , a reporter .
She was told by the police officers that they wanted to help her look modest so men would not look at her and cause her inconvenience , she said .
She received a warning about her large sunglasses , her coat , her eyeliner and her socks , which the police officers said should be longer .
She was allowed to go after she signed a letter , which included her name and address , saying she would not appear in public like that again .
The police have said the letters will be used against violators in court if they defy the rules a second time .
Another woman , Niloofar , 28 , who responded angrily to the police when she was told to fix her head scarf because too much of her hair was showing , said she was kept in a bus for five hours .

Bush approval rating hits new low WASHINGTON  President Bush 's approval rating has slumped to 31 % in a new USA TODAY / Gallup Poll , the lowest of his presidency and a warning sign for Republicans in the November elections .
The survey of 1,013 adults , taken Friday through Sunday , shows Bush 's standing down by 3 percentage points in a single week .
His disapproval rating also reached a record : 65 % .
The margin of error is +/- 3 percentage points .
" It is a challenging political environment , " acknowledges Tracey Schmitt , a spokeswoman for the Republican National Committee , " but we are confident that ultimately voters in November will recognize that a Democrat Congress would simply not be equipped to ensure either economic or national security for our nation . "
Bush 's fall is being fueled by erosion among support from conservatives and Republicans .
In the poll , 52 % of conservatives and 68 % of Republicans approved of the job he is doing .
Both are record lows among those groups .
Moderates gave him an approval rating of 28 % , liberals of 7 % .
" You hear people say he has a hard core that will never desert him , and that has been the case for most of the administration , " says Charles Franklin , a political scientist at the University of Wisconsin who studies presidential approval ratings .
" But for the last few months , we started to see that hard core seriously erode in support . "
Only four presidents have scored lower approval ratings since the Gallup Poll began regularly measuring it in the mid-1940s : Harry Truman , Richard Nixon , Jimmy Carter and the first George Bush .
When Nixon , Carter and the elder Bush sank below 35 % , they never again registered above 40 % .
Truman twice sank into the low 30s and then rose into the 60s , but the third time his rating fell , it stayed below 40 % as well .
" Historically it 's been pretty devastating to presidents at this level , " Franklin says .
Even Republican members of Congress are " now so worried about their electoral fortunes in November that he has less leverage with them than he normally would with his own party controlling Congress . "

Only four presidents have scored a lower approval rating in a Gallup survey than Bush 's current 31 % number .
Panbanisha wants coffee – a tall decaf Starbucks caramel macchiato , to be exact .
Midway through a demonstration of her extensive vocabulary , obligingly pointing to the correct symbols on a complex board for " yogurt , " " egg , " and " hurt , " she switches gears and points to the symbols for " candy " and " coffee " – her term for a caramel macchiato .
" You want coffee , Panbanisha ? " asks William Fields , a senior researcher at Des Moines 's Great Ape Trust – a question that Panbanisha responds to with an enthusiastic series of loud shrieks .
A few more exchanges , and she 's made sure he knows to get enough for the other six apes , to get " marshmallow " – her word for the foam on top – and to get the drinks now !
Panbanisha is a bonobo – one of the four great ape species , also sometimes called a pygmy chimpanzee , and one of the most humanlike .
She is on the cutting edge of research that 's revealing a surprising amount about how bonobos learn – and how similar to their human cousins they really are .
The exploration into one of the most fascinating dimensions of the animal kingdom is taking place in a new state - of - the - art research facility on the edge of this Midwestern city .
Here , in a massive concrete - and - glass structure , scientists are watching how the bonobos interact as they live in conditions not unlike suburban America .
The primates , for instance , enjoy an enviable view of the lake and forest that surround the center , which they often get to explore when the weather cooperates .
Inside , they have climbing towers and a splashing pool with a waterfall they can turn on themselves .
When visitors come , the bonobos decide whether or not to let them into the special visiting room , where they can exchange food or other items from vending machines .
They can watch videos – favorites include gorilla films and ( does this sound familiar ? ) movies of themselves .
They leaf through books and magazines .
The bonobos seem to have everything but TiVo and a Toyota Camry in the driveway .
***
At the center of the research here is language .
The work at the Great Ape Trust grew out of a project begun more than 20 years ago in which researchers tried to use symbols – called lexigrams – to communicate with bonobos in a new way .
They wanted to avoid criticisms of past language research , such as the possibility that apes were just responding to nonverbal signals .
They had little success with Matata , an older bonobo born in the wild .
But when she was away from the research station one day , scientists discovered that her young son , Kanzi , had learned a dozen of the lexigram symbols – like " banana , " " peanuts , " " bite , " and " tickle " – without any actual instruction , simply by being nearby .
Today , Kanzi knows more than 360 lexigrams and understands several thousand spoken words of English .
" The only organisms capable of learning language are babies , " says Mr. Fields , who has been with the project almost since the beginning .
The mistake other research has made , he says , is trying to teach apes words the same way they would a second language – almost like a Berlitz class for animals .
What 's needed is to pick it up as a first language like humans do – by constant exposure to it at a young age , as a part of their everyday culture .
Most of the study has taken place at the Language Research Center at Georgia State University in Atlanta .
Today , Kanzi and his sister , Panbanisha , along with Matata and four other bonobos , have moved to their new home at the Great Ape Trust here , where researchers hope the comfortable surroundings will help the primates develop and express themselves .
Their character and curiosity is definitely coming out .
Kanzi , for instance , shows a particular liking for the Victoria 's Secret catalogue .
" Good Night , Gorilla " seems to be a favorite book of the whole clan .
Panbanisha may be the next Julia Child :
She recently watched a tape of herself making eggs and noodles in the kitchen , and , as Fields looked on , she pointed to various lexigrams to narrate what would happen next .
Kanzi loves to play with his ball and the other toys , which he lugs around in his backpack .
He knows how to build a fire and works with primitive tools :
He 'll flake and sharpen stones and then use them to cut rope .
On this day , Panbanisha dutifully – and rapidly – points to the lexigrams that a researcher requests .
But she devotes most of her attention to trying to get a screw out of the battery compartment of a talking toy dog with a pair of scissors .
Nearby , Kanzi is busy threading beads on a string – not an easy task with his large fingers .
But he 's persistent and surprisingly adept .
" I went into this as a true skeptic , " says Duane Rumbaugh , who 's been researching apes and language for several decades .
" I anticipated failure with apes . "
Instead , Dr. Rumbaugh has become a true believer that apes are capable of understanding language , not just responding to visual cues .
Researchers are able to capture all the bonobos ' actions because of a phalanx of cameras at the center , one of its most important features .
The research team – which includes Fields , Rumbaugh , and Sue Savage - Rumbaugh ( lead scientist ) – is doing more than just exploring the limits of ape communication and intelligence .
It 's trying to understand the role culture plays in their learning .
" You can't have language without culture , or without choice and agency , " Fields says .
***
Watching Panbanisha put on a halloween mask to scare visitors , or seeing Kanzi goad visitors into chasing each other , it 's hard not to see them as part human .
And the researchers clearly feel a bond that goes far beyond scientist and subject .
" It 's like your own child , " says Fields , as he talks about the week when Nyota , one of the youngest bonobos , nearly died .
Fields did n't sleep for seven days .
" Nyota loves Spiderman and Harry Potter , he did n't like Catwoman – he 's really just a normal little boy . "
Kanzi may be the media superstar of the group , famous from articles and photos , but Fields and Dr. Rumbaugh say Panbanisha is the analytical genius :
She may understand as many as 6,000 spoken words .
" Unlike Kanzi , she does n't care about showing off what she knows , " Fields says .
She 's also empathetic .
Fields remembers the day in Georgia when an armless orangutan whom Panbanisha felt protective of had n't come inside , and Panbanisha got Fields 's attention and reminded him to take milk to the primate – now .
Another time , when Fields locked himself in a room , he sent her to tell Savage - Rumbaugh to bring a key .
" These are anecdotes , " says Fields .
" But with cameras running all the time , you can start to get the data . "
In the end , he and the other researchers will shed light not just on apes as our closest living relative , but on humans , too .
" I think we can define culture in the kind of way anthropologists have been trying to do for a long time , " says Fields .
And they hope that the discoveries about just how intelligent – and human – the bonobos and other apes are may help spur more efforts to save the threatened species in the wild , and offer insights into how best to do it .
I think Lindsay forgot to wear tights or pants with this top .
It ’s not a dress hunny !
I love wearing skirts as dresses , but when a dress is too short it can make the slimmest of girls look like she has thunder thighs .
Either that or show off her panties ( or lack there of ) .
Mini length hemlines are in , but that just looks silly Lindsay !
Cute shoes though .

I stumbled across an interesting article today – 9 Top Caffeine Fixes .
How approperiate that I found this article as I was sipping my second cup of coffee of the day .
What surprised me is that now the medical community is stating that caffeine taken in moderate doses can be good for you overall health , similar to the past findings that glass red wine , dark chocolate , and olive oil also provide good health benefits .
Some of the benefits that caffeine can provide is increased alertness , short - term memory , 40 % lower risk of developing gallstones in men , lower risk of developing Parkeinson ’s disease , 25 % lower risk of colon cancer , and even relief for asthma symptoms .
However , like anything we take , too much of it can be detrimental .
For instance , too much caffeine can cause nervousness , jitters , insomnia , increase heart rate , and possible links to rheumatoid arthritis .
I guess you could also include that pesky withdrawal sympton – migraine headaches .
Here are a few of our favorite drinks and their caffeine content from Beauty Eats by Real Age .

When you turn on the Oscars , what are you really watching ?
Most people admit it 's a good excuse for a fashion show .
And it seems an obvious choice between Keira Knightley ’s elegant , wine - colored Vera Wang and Gwyneth ’s 2003 gothic horror show .
But then why , if it ’s that obvious , do stars continue to mistake the Oscars for that other dress - up day on the 31st of October ?
With a cadre of stylists , trainers and designers , and without needing to fit the dress inside a small pocketbook , would n’t you think they could get it right every time ?
Now they can .
Will Her Oscar Dress Be A Hit ?
Run the numbers to see which stars won and lost the fashion competition at this year 's Oscars .
Or , call your favorite fashion - challenged star in the next four days and tell them to read this blog before setting foot on the red carpet to ensure she comes off as beauty and not the beast .
This equation says that the nicer the star ’s figure , the more revealing the dress should be ( though please stop short of Beyonce at the Golden Globes , who got most critics ’ ‘ booby prize ’ ) .
Also , most successful dresses tend toward the stylistically tried and true , falling between three and six on the 1 - 10 scale of ambition .
And it ’s always nice to add the legitimacy of a big - name designer and to be on top of this year ’s trends .
• S= Percentage of skin covered by dress ( at this year ’s Golden Globes , Beyonce ’s dress covered approximately 50 % — too little in most experts ’ opinions )
• T= How tight is the dress ?
( 1 - 10 with 10 being “ painted on ” )
• BF= How beautiful is the star ’s figure ?
( 1 - 10 with 10 being “ J - Lo ” )
• BI= Beauty is more than skin deep — what percentage of people do you think are predisposed to think the best of this star ?
( Julia Roberts would probably be around 95 % , while Paris Hilton would be around 10 % )
• D= Of ten average Oscar viewers , how many have heard of the dress ’ designer ?
• A= How ambitious is the dress ( 1 - 10 with 1 being “ little , black ” and 10 being “ bells , whistles ” )
• T= How closely does the dress match this year ’s trends ?
( 1 - 10 with 10 being “ white at this year ’s Golden Globes or pockets at last year ’s Oscars ” )

For the developer , automated garages offer cost advantages in construction and operation .
By omitting ramps and walkways , about twice as many cars can be tucked into the space .
Labor and insurance costs are lower , and getting cars in and out is faster .
Michael Stolzer , dispatched from Stolzer Parkhaus in Germany to help set up the new garage , showed off the computerized control area and the storage floors .
The cars on their pallets can be stacked more tightly than those in a traditional garage ; clearance in the storage cubicles is only roof - high , not human - head high .
The design recalls the way bakeries stack goods on racks : car cakes on trays .
AutoMotion has built only one previous project in the United States , a 74 - space automated garage at the Summit Grand Parc , a luxury residential building in Washington , not far from the White House .
But the company has three more projects under way in the New York area , Mr. Milstein said .
Automated garages are much more common in Europe and Asia , said John Van Horn , editor and publisher of Parking Today , a magazine , Web site and blog based in Los Angeles .
“ There are thousands of them in Europe , ” he said .
“ There is one on practically every corner in Japan .
In the U.S. , it has mostly been a matter of European technology licensed to people who do n’t understand the parking industry . ”
But the Baxter Street project is different , said Mr. Van Horn , who visited the site this month .
“ With the technology and the footprint there , it should be viable , ” he said .
There are economic incentives : a traditional garage on the site could have held only 24 cars , too few to be feasible .
And , he noted , AutoMotion is affiliated with one of the building ’s developers , the American Development Group .
An earlier and much publicized automated project in Hoboken helped to raise doubts about such operations .
Opened in 2002 , the Garden Street garage was designed by Robotic Parking Systems of Clearwater , Fla .
In 2004 , a Cadillac dropped several floors in the garage and a Jeep suffered a similar fate a year later .
Jeff Faria , a spokesman for Robotic Parking , said the problems resulted from factors other than the garage ’s equipment .

THE nine judges of Thailand 's Constitutional Tribunal took ten hours to outline in a marathon session , televised live on May 30th , the electoral - fraud cases against the country 's two main political parties ( and several small ones ) .
They explained in elaborate detail why Thai Rak Thai ( TRT ) , the largest , was being disbanded , whereas its main opponent , the Democrat party , was cleared of all charges .
However , the elegance of their legal arguments may be lost on millions of Thais .
They gave TRT sweeping election victories in 2001 and 2005 and probably still support the party and its leader , Thaksin Shinawatra .
As voters may see it , the country 's most popular party has been destroyed by a court set up by the military junta that seized power last year , claiming to be rescuing democracy .
A week before the tribunal 's rulings , Thailand 's revered King Bhumibol intervened , giving warning that his realm was “ close to sinking ” and noting that “ political parties must exist ” .
This raised hopes that the tribunal would stop short of dissolving either main party , and punish only individual politicians .
Those hopes have been dashed .
In four months of hearings , the tribunal examined allegations of misbehaviour by the accused parties during a snap election Mr Thaksin had called in April last year .
The Democrats and other parties boycotted the election , claiming it would be unfair .
The courts later found grounds to annul the results , after the king urged them to sort out the “ mess ” .
TRT was accused among other things of bribing small parties to take part in the election , while the Democrats were accused of inducing leaders of smaller parties to make false accusations against TRT .
After the coup , the junta , led by the army chief , General Sonthi Boonyaratglin , replaced the Constitutional Court with a new tribunal , whose judges it selected , and told it to pursue the electoral - fraud cases .
The junta also appointed an interim government of old soldiers and bureaucrats ; and created a temporary parliament and another unelected body to write a new constitution .
The generals also set up investigations into the allegations of corruption and abuse of power by the Thaksin administration , while their interim government sought to borrow some of its policies , such as cheap health care and development funds for rural villages , which had made “ Thaksinomics ” so popular .
However , although the corruption investigations have unearthed enough evidence to press charges , they failed to find enough of a “ smoking gun ” to wreck Mr Thaksin 's reputation irreparably .
Meanwhile , the interim government has dithered and bungled , dragging down the economy and making Thaksinomics , for all its other flaws , look good .
And Mr Thaksin , through a series of stunts such as bidding for Britain 's Manchester City football club , has ensured he is not forgotten .
This week 's judgment would appear to eliminate TRT and prevent any comeback by Mr Thaksin and his henchmen .
But the generals are far from being in the clear .
Lesser figures in TRT may regroup and find ways to recapture the party 's millions of votes , in the elections the junta promises to hold by the year 's end .
That is if things get that far .
The junta 's constitution - writing body has already backtracked on several undemocratic clauses it tried to slip into the new charter , such as permitting an unelected prime minister and allowing for a “ crisis council ” , including military chiefs , to step in and solve political conflicts .
But other unpopular provisions — such as having the Senate appointed by judges and bureaucrats rather than elected — remain in the draft .
So voters , angry at the destruction of the party many support , may reject the proposed charter in the referendum the junta is promising to hold .
The mobilisation of police and soldiers ordered by the jumpy generals to head off protests , and their censorship of pro-Thaksin websites and radio stations , may not be enough to prevent rising popular unrest against the regime , despite Mr Thaksin 's call on his supporters to accept the verdict .
Local newspapers had quoted one of the nine judges as saying they would “ apply the spirit ” of the coup - makers in making their rulings .
This , plus the severity of the punishment meted out to Mr Thaksin and his party , and the absolution of the Democrats , will only raise suspicions that the destruction of TRT was a pre-determined outcome .
Hopes of a peaceful move back to democracy have dimmed .
Kucinich announces impeachment charges against Vice President Cheney Michael Roston
Published : Tuesday April 24 , 2007 Print This Email This Update : The Articles of Impeachment themselves are now available , and can be accessed via a link at the bottom of the story .
After a series of delays , late in the day on Wednesday , Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) , a candidate for president in 2008 , announced a series of charges against Vice President Dick Cheney in Washington , DC .
Kucinich alleged that the Vice President had committed a series of impeachable offenses and stated that he was therefore introducing Articles of Impeachment against Cheney in the Congress today .
Kucinich started off by reading the opening words of the Declaration of Independence , commenting that they were " instructive at this moment . "
" Whenever any government official becomes destructive of the founding purposes , that official must be held accountable , " he said .
The Ohio Democrat described his move as intended to provide a " defense of the rights of American people to have a government that is honest and peaceful . "
Kucinich excoriated the Vice President who he said was " a driving force for taking us into war against Iraq under false pretenses , and is once again rattling sabers of war against Iran , with the same intent to drive America into war , again based on false pretenses . "
The Ohio Congressman , who is running for president for the second time , noted three charges in his Articles of Impeachment , which were submitted as House Resolution 333 .
The first concerned manipulation of intelligence about Iraq 's threat to the US .
The second concerned manipulation of intelligence on the Iraq - Al - Qaida relationship .
The last concerned what he called having " openly threatened aggression against the Republic of Iran . "
Kucinich claimed in the press conference that the charges were " deeply researched " and insisted that his accusations were not just a political stunt .
" This is not brought forth lightly .
I 've carefully weighed the options available to Members of Congress , and I have found this path the path that is most important to take , " he explained .
Kucinich dodged a question about whether or not he had the support of fellow Members of Congress .
He said the Articles were just now being examined by Congress members and " you ca n't expect anyone to make a snap judgment . "
He also said that he was only introducing the resolution and was not going to try and persuade Members of Congress to join him " I 'm not promoting it , " he told Wolf Blitzer on CNN 's Situation Room .
The former Cleveland Mayor further acknowledged in the press conference that he had not recently spoken with Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ( D - CA ) on the matter .
Pelosi had said last year that impeachment was " off the table . "
In a conference call with today , the Speaker went further , telling RAW STORY that " President Bush was not worth it " because impeachment proceedings would be a distraction from passing Democratic policies that would ensure the party 's future political victory .
" We will do more work to make for our own reelection , and maintain a Democratic Congress , and have a Democratic President , " she said .
" And frankly , for impeachment , George W. Bush is just not worth it .
We have great work to do for the American people . "
Kucinich also acknowledged that he had not yet discussed his charges with Rep. John Conyers ( D - MI ) , the Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , whose committee must consider whether or not to forward the articles on to Congress .
A reporter asked Kucinich why the Vice President should be impeached and not President George W. Bush .
" There is a very practical reason  each and every charge relates to Vice President Cheney 's conduct or misconduct in office , " he answered .
But he added , " It is very important that we start with Mr. Cheney because if we were to start with the President , Mr. Cheney would then become president .
He also noted , " We 'd have to go through the constitutional agony of impeaching two presidents consecutively . "
The full Articles themselves , a large collection of PDF documents , are accessible at Congressman Kucinich 's website .
This article shows 2 awesome ways to implement caching on your website using Apache .htaccess ( httpd.conf ) files on the Apache Web Server .
Both methods are extremely simple to set up and will dramatically speed up your site !
i FModule for fail - safe .htaccess
At least one of the 2 modules needs to be built into Apache ; although they are included in the distribution , they are not turned on by default .
To find out if the modules are enabled in your server , find the httpd binary and run httpd -l ; this should print a list of the available modules .
The modules we 're looking for are mod_expires and mod_headers .
If they are n't available , and you have administrative access , you can recompile Apache to include them .
This can be done either by uncommenting the appropriate lines in the Configuration file , or using the - enable - module=expires and - enable - module=headers arguments to configure ( 1.3 or greater ) .
< ifModule mod_expires.c> # any Expires Directives go here </ifModule > < ifModule mod_headers.c> # any Header directives go here </ ifModule >

Caching Concepts
Web Caching Tutorial -
By setting an expiry time for the files on your Web site , you can go even farther than merely relying on the conditional GET and the 304 response that a server sends when a file has not changed ...
You can prevent the contact with the server from happening at all by using the Expires header and the Cache - control header .
If a browser receives an image with the cache control headers that say the image can be considered fresh for 2 weeks , then for 2 weeks the image can be pulled directly from the browser 's ( or proxy 's ) cache on subsequent requests .
This is noticeably faster than even a conditional GET and a 304 response from the server since there is no round trip .
After two weeks , a conditional GET would be sent to the server to check the Last - Modified date , then again , no requests would be made for the duration of the specified freshness period .
So , briefly , these 2 mechanisms require no coding changes to your existing Web pages , and they works to avoid the unnecessary requests and connections to your Web server for files that do not need to be requested with each visit .
Part of the rationale behind ETags is to provide sub - one second resolution in validating cached entities , where Last - Modified are limited to one second resolution .
The ETag certainly has its uses , but it serves more as an alternative to the Last - Modified value rather than an expiry - based caching mechanism .
You can use mod_expires to take care of expires and max - age , and use mod_headers to " manually " configure the following :
Cache - Control : no-store
This object may not be stored in any cache , even the requestor 's browser cache .
Cache - Control : no-cache
This object may be held in any cache but it must be revalidated every time it is requested .
Cache - Control : private
This object can be stored in the requesting browserÂ´s cache but not in a shared cache ... Cache - Control : must - revalidate Tells caches that they must obey any freshness information you give them about an object .
The HTTP allows caches to take liberties with the freshness of objects ; by specifying this header , you 're telling the cache that you want it to strictly follow your rules .
Cache - Control : proxy - revalidate Similar to must - revalidate , except that it only applies to proxy caches .
Caching with mod_expires
This module controls the setting of the Expires HTTP header and the max - age directive of the Cache - Control HTTP header in server responses .
The expiration date can set to be relative to either the time the source file was last modified , or to the time of the client access .
These HTTP headers are an instruction to the client about the document 's validity and persistence .
If cached , the document may be fetched from the cache rather than from the source until this time has passed .
After that , the cache copy is considered " expired " and invalid , and a new copy must be obtained from the source .

Cache - Control Header
The Cache - Control general - header field is used to specify directives that MUST be obeyed by all caching mechanisms along the request / response chain .
The directives specify behavior intended to prevent caches from adversely interfering with the request or response .
These directives typically override the default caching algorithms .
Cache directives are unidirectional in that the presence of a directive in a request does not imply that the same directive is to be given in the response .
Note that HTTP / 1.0 caches might not implement Cache - Control and might only implement Pragma : no-cache .
Cache directives MUST be passed through by a proxy or gateway application , regardless of their significance to that application , since the directives might be applicable to all recipients along the request / response chain .
It is not possible to specify a cache- directive for a specific cache .
Cache - Control = " Cache - Control " " : " 1 # cache - directive cache - directive = cache - request - directive | cache - response - directive cache - request - directive = " no - cache " | " no- store " | " max -age " " = " delta - seconds | " max - stale " [ " = " delta - seconds ] | " min-fresh " " = " delta - seconds | " no-transform " | " only - if - cached " | cache - extension cache - response - directive = " public " | " private " [ " = " < "> 1#field - name < " > ] | " no - cache " [ " = " < "> 1#field - name < " > ] | " no - store " | " no-transform " | " must - revalidate " | " proxy - revalidate " | " max -age " " = " delta - seconds | " s- maxage " " = " delta - seconds | cache - extension cache - extension = token [ " = " ( token | quoted - string ) ]
When a directive appears without any 1 # field - name parameter , the directive applies to the entire request or response .
When such a directive appears with a 1 # field - name parameter , it applies only to the named field or fields , and not to the rest of the request or response .
This mechanism supports extensibility ; implementations of future versions of the HTTP protocol might apply these directives to header fields not defined in HTTP / 1.1 .
Cache - Control Directive Categories
The cache - control directives can be broken down into these general categories :
Restrictions on what are cacheable ; these may only be imposed by the origin server .
Restrictions on what may be stored by a cache ; these may be imposed by either the origin server or the user agent .
Modifications of the basic expiration mechanism ; these may be imposed by either the origin server or the user agent .
Controls over cache revalidation and reload ; these may only be imposed by a user agent .
Control over transformation of entities .
Extensions to the caching system .
What is Cacheable ?
By default , a response is cacheable if the requirements of the request method , request header fields , and the response status indicate that it is cacheable .
Section 13.4 summarizes these defaults for cacheability .
The following Cache - Control response directives allow an origin server to override the default cacheability of a response :
public
Indicates that the response MAY be cached by any cache , even if it would normally be non-cacheable or cacheable only within a non-shared cache .
private
Indicates that all or part of the response message is intended for a single user and MUST NOT be cached by a shared cache .
This allows an origin server to state that the specified parts of the response are intended for only one user and are not a valid response for requests by other users .
A private ( non-shared ) cache MAY cache the response .
Note :
This usage of the word private only controls where the response may be cached , and cannot ensure the privacy of the message content .
If the no-cache directive does not specify a field - name , then a cache MUST NOT use the response to satisfy a subsequent request without successful revalidation with the origin server .
This allows an origin server to prevent caching even by caches that have been configured to return stale responses to client requests .
If the no-cache directive does specify one or more field - names , then a cache MAY use the response to satisfy a subsequent request , subject to any other restrictions on caching .
However , the specified field - name (s ) MUST NOT be sent in the response to a subsequent request without successful revalidation with the origin server .
This allows an origin server to prevent the re-use of certain header fields in a response , while still allowing caching of the rest of the response .
Note : Most HTTP /1.0 caches will not recognize or obey this directive .
What May be Stored by Caches ?
The purpose of the no-store directive is to prevent the inadvertent release or retention of sensitive information ( for example , on backup tapes ) .
The no -store directive applies to the entire message , and MAY be sent either in a response or in a request .
If sent in a request , a cache MUST NOT store any part of either this request or any response to it .
If sent in a response , a cache MUST NOT store any part of either this response or the request that elicited it .
This directive applies to both non- shared and shared caches .
" MUST NOT store " in this context means that the cache MUST NOT intentionally store the information in non-volatile storage , and MUST make a best - effort attempt to remove the information from volatile storage as promptly as possible after forwarding it .
Even when this directive is associated with a response , users might explicitly store such a response outside of the caching system ( e.g. , with a " Save As " dialog ) .
History buffers MAY store such responses as part of their normal operation .
The purpose of this directive is to meet the stated requirements of certain users and service authors who are concerned about accidental releases of information via unanticipated accesses to cache data structures .
While the use of this directive might improve privacy in some cases , we caution that it is NOT in any way a reliable or sufficient mechanism for ensuring privacy .
In particular , malicious or compromised caches might not recognize or obey this directive , and communications networks might be vulnerable to eavesdropping .
Saving dynamic file to static file to cache
Back up a bit and take a look at this problem from a higher level .
If you implement this solution , you will have to manually update that Last - Modified date now and forever .
The potential for error is large , and it's also a maintenance headache -
You will never be able to take a vacation / holiday without serving a stale file for the duration .
A manual approach involves modifying the script to write its output to a static file , and then serving that static file .
When a request arrives , you can use mod_rewrite to check for the existence of that static file .
If it exists , serve it .
If not , run the script again to re-create it , then serve it .
How you manage the expiration of the static file depends on your needs ;
You can delete the static file manually to force a regeneration -- which is again a maintenance headache .
Or you can set up a cron job to delete it every so many minutes or hours .
How you set up cron jobs varies by host , but look in your control panel first .
An example of the mod_rewrite code for use in /.htaccess
# If static html page exists RewriteCond %{DOCUMENT_ROOT} /$ 1.html -f # rewrite php file requests to it RewriteRule ^( php - file ) \.php$ /$ 1.html [ L ]

Modifications of the Basic Expiration Mechanism
The expiration time of an entity MAY be specified by the origin server using the Expires header .
Alternatively , it MAY be specified using the max - age directive in a response .
When the max - age cache - control directive is present in a cached response , the response is stale if its current age is greater than the age value given ( in seconds ) at the time of a new request for that resource .
The max - age directive on a response implies that the response is cacheable ( i.e. , " public " ) unless some other , more restrictive cache directive is also present .
If a response includes both an Expires header and a max - age directive , the max - age directive overrides the Expires header , even if the Expires header is more restrictive .
This rule allows an origin server to provide , for a given response , a longer expiration time to an HTTP / 1.1 ( or later ) cache than to an HTTP / 1.0 cache .
This might be useful if certain HTTP / 1.0 caches improperly calculate ages or expiration times , perhaps due to desynchronized clocks .
Many HTTP /1.0 cache implementations will treat an Expires value that is less than or equal to the response Date value as being equivalent to the Cache - Control response directive " no- cache " .
If an HTTP / 1.1 cache receives such a response , and the response does not include a Cache - Control header field , it SHOULD consider the response to be non-cacheable in order to retain compatibility with HTTP / 1.0 servers .
Note :
An origin server might wish to use a relatively new HTTP cache control feature , such as the " private " directive , on a network including older caches that do not understand that feature .
The origin server will need to combine the new feature with an Expires field whose value is less than or equal to the Date value .
This will prevent older caches from improperly caching the response .
s- maxage
If a response includes an s-maxage directive , then for a shared cache ( but not for a private cache ) , the maximum age specified by this directive overrides the maximum age specified by either the max - age directive or the Expires header .
The s-maxage directive also implies the semantics of the proxy - revalidate directive , i.e. , that the shared cache must not use the entry after it becomes stale to respond to a subsequent request without first revalidating it with the origin server .
The s-maxage directive is always ignored by a private cache .
Note that most older caches , not compliant with this specification , do not implement any cache - control directives .
An origin server wishing to use a cache - control directive that restricts , but does not prevent , caching by an HTTP / 1.1 - compliant cache MAY exploit the requirement that the max - age directive overrides the Expires header , and the fact that pre-HTTP / 1.1 - compliant caches do not observe the max - age directive .
Other directives allow a user agent to modify the basic expiration mechanism .
These directives MAY be specified on a request :
Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose age is no greater than the specified time in seconds .
Unless max - stale directive is also included , the client is not willing to accept a stale response .
Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose freshness lifetime is no less than its current age plus the specified time in seconds .
That is , the client wants a response that will still be fresh for at least the specified number of seconds .
Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response that has exceeded its expiration time .
If max - stale is assigned a value , then the client is willing to accept a response that has exceeded its expiration time by no more than the specified number of seconds .
If no value is assigned to max - stale , then the client is willing to accept a stale response of any age .
If a cache returns a stale response , either because of a max - stale directive on a request , or because the cache is configured to override the expiration time of a response , the cache MUST attach a Warning header to the stale response , using Warning 110 ( Response is stale ) .
A cache MAY be configured to return stale responses without validation , but only if this does not conflict with any " MUST " - level requirements concerning cache validation ( e.g. , a " must - revalidate " cache - control directive ) .
If both the new request and the cached entry include " max - age " directives , then the lesser of the two values is used for determining the freshness of the cached entry for that request .
Cache Revalidation and Reload Controls
Sometimes a user agent might want or need to insist that a cache revalidate its cache entry with the origin server ( and not just with the next cache along the path to the origin server ) , or to reload its cache entry from the origin server .
End - to - end revalidation might be necessary if either the cache or the origin server has overestimated the expiration time of the cached response .
End - to - end reload may be necessary if the cache entry has become corrupted for some reason .
End - to - end revalidation may be requested either when the client does not have its own local cached copy , in which case we call it " unspecified end - to - end revalidation " , or when the client does have a local cached copy , in which case we call it " specific end - to - end revalidation . "
The client can specify these three kinds of action using Cache - Control request directives :
End - to - end reload
The request includes a " no- cache " cache - control directive or , for compatibility with HTTP / 1.0 clients , " Pragma : no - cache " .
Field names MUST NOT be included with the no-cache directive in a request .
The server MUST NOT use a cached copy when responding to such a request .
Specific end - to - end revalidation
The request includes a " max- age=0 " cache - control directive , which forces each cache along the path to the origin server to revalidate its own entry , if any , with the next cache or server .
The initial request includes a cache - validating conditional with the client 's current validator .
Unspecified end - to - end revalidation
The request includes " max - age=0 " cache - control directive , which forces each cache along the path to the origin server to revalidate its own entry , if any , with the next cache or server .
The initial request does not include a cache - validating conditional ; the first cache along the path ( if any ) that holds a cache entry for this resource includes a cache - validating conditional with its current validator .
When an intermediate cache is forced , by means of a max - age=0 directive , to revalidate its own cache entry , and the client has supplied its own validator in the request , the supplied validator might differ from the validator currently stored with the cache entry .
In this case , the cache MAY use either validator in making its own request without affecting semantic transparency .
However , the choice of validator might affect performance .
The best approach is for the intermediate cache to use its own validator when making its request .
If the server replies with 304 ( Not Modified ) , then the cache can return its now validated copy to the client with a 200 ( OK ) response .
If the server replies with a new entity and cache validator , however , the intermediate cache can compare the returned validator with the one provided in the client 's request , using the strong comparison function .
If the client 's validator is equal to the origin server 's , then the intermediate cache simply returns 304 ( Not Modified ) .
Otherwise , it returns the new entity with a 200 ( OK ) response .
If a request includes the no-cache directive , it SHOULD NOT include min-fresh , max - stale , or max -age .
In some cases , such as times of extremely poor network connectivity , a client may want a cache to return only those responses that it currently has stored , and not to reload or revalidate with the origin server .
To do this , the client may include the only - if - cached directive in a request .
If it receives this directive , a cache SHOULD either respond using a cached entry that is consistent with the other constraints of the request , or respond with a 504 ( Gateway Timeout ) status .
However , if a group of caches is being operated as a unified system with good internal connectivity , such a request MAY be forwarded within that group of caches .
Because a cache MAY be configured to ignore a server 's specified expiration time , and because a client request MAY include a max - stale directive ( which has a similar effect ) , the protocol also includes a mechanism for the origin server to require revalidation of a cache entry on any subsequent use .
When the must - revalidate directive is present in a response received by a cache , that cache MUST NOT use the entry after it becomes stale to respond to a subsequent request without first revalidating it with the origin server .
( I.e. , the cache MUST do an end - to - end revalidation every time , if , based solely on the origin server 's Expires or max - age value , the cached response is stale . )
The must - revalidate directive is necessary to support reliable operation for certain protocol features .
In all circumstances an HTTP / 1.1 cache MUST obey the must - revalidate directive ; in particular , if the cache cannot reach the origin server for any reason , it MUST generate a 504 ( Gateway Timeout ) response .
Servers SHOULD send the must - revalidate directive if and only if failure to revalidate a request on the entity could result in incorrect operation , such as a silently unexecuted financial transaction .
Recipients MUST NOT take any automated action that violates this directive , and MUST NOT automatically provide an unvalidated copy of the entity if revalidation fails .
Although this is not recommended , user agents operating under severe connectivity constraints MAY violate this directive but , if so , MUST explicitly warn the user that an unvalidated response has been provided .
The warning MUST be provided on each unvalidated access , and SHOULD require explicit user confirmation .
The proxy - revalidate directive has the same meaning as the must - revalidate directive , except that it does not apply to non-shared user agent caches .
It can be used on a response to an authenticated request to permit the user 's cache to store and later return the response without needing to revalidate it ( since it has already been authenticated once by that user ) , while still requiring proxies that service many users to revalidate each time ( in order to make sure that each user has been authenticated ) .
Note that such authenticated responses also need the public cache control directive in order to allow them to be cached at all .
No - Transform Directive
no - transform Implementors of intermediate caches ( proxies ) have found it useful to convert the media type of certain entity bodies .
A non- transparent proxy might , for example , convert between image formats in order to save cache space or to reduce the amount of traffic on a slow link .
Serious operational problems occur , however , when these transformations are applied to entity bodies intended for certain kinds of applications .
For example , applications for medical imaging , scientific data analysis and those using end - to - end authentication , all depend on receiving an entity body that is bit for bit identical to the original entity - body .
Therefore , if a message includes the no-transform directive , an intermediate cache or proxy MUST NOT change those headers that are listed in section 13.5.2 as being subject to the no-transform directive .
This implies that the cache or proxy MUST NOT change any aspect of the entity - body that is specified by these headers , including the value of the entity - body itself .
Apache Caching Guide
Expiry Periods
The default expiry period for cached entities is one hour , however this can be easily over - ridden by using the CacheDefaultExpire directive .
This default is only used when the original source of the content does not specify an expire time or time of last modification .
If a response does not include an Expires header but does include a Last - Modified header , mod_cache can infer an expiry period based on the use of the CacheLastModified Factor directive .
For local content , mod_expires may be used to fine - tune the expiry period .
The maximum expiry period may also be controlled by using the CacheMaxExpire .
A Brief Guide to Conditional Requests
When content expires from the cache and is re-requested from the backend or content provider , rather than pass on the original request , Apache will use a conditional request instead .
HTTP offers a number of headers which allow a client , or cache to discern between different versions of the same content .
For example if a resource was served with an " Etag : " header , it is possible to make a conditional request with an " If - Match : " header .
If a resource was served with a " Last - Modified : " header it is possible to make a conditional request with an " If - Modified - Since : " header , and so on .
When such a conditional request is made , the response differs depending on whether the content matches the conditions .
If a request is made with an " If - Modified - Since : " header , and the content has not been modified since the time indicated in the request then a terse " 304 Not Modified " response is issued .
If the content has changed , then it is served as if the request were not conditional to begin with .
The benefits of conditional requests in relation to caching are twofold .
Firstly , when making such a request to the backend , if the content from the backend matches the content in the store , this can be determined easily and without the overhead of transferring the entire resource .
Secondly , conditional requests are usually less strenuous on the backend .
For static files , typically all that is involved is a call to stat ( ) or similar system call , to see if the file has changed in size or modification time .
As such , even if Apache is caching local content , even expired content may still be served faster from the cache if it has not changed .
As long as reading from the cache store is faster than reading from the backend ( e.g. an in - memory cache compared to reading from disk ) .
What Can be Cached ?
As mentioned already , the two styles of caching in Apache work differently , mod_file_cache caching maintains file contents as they were when Apache was started .
When a request is made for a file that is cached by this module , it is intercepted and the cached file is served .
mod_cache caching on the other hand is more complex .
When serving a request , if it has not been cached previously , the caching module will determine if the content is cacheable .
The conditions for determining cachability of a response are ; Caching must be enabled for this URL .
See the CacheEnable and CacheDisable directives .
The response must have a HTTP status code of 200 , 203 , 300 , 301 or 410 .
The request must be a HTTP GET request .
If the request contains an " Authorization : " header , the response will not be cached .
If the response contains an " Authorization : " header , it must also contain an " s- maxage " , " must - revalidate " or " public " option in the " Cache - Control : " header .
If the URL included a query string ( e.g. from a HTML form GET method ) it will not be cached unless the response includes an " Expires : " header , as per RFC2616 section 13.9 .
If the response has a status of 200 ( OK ) , the response must also include at least one of the " Etag " , " Last - Modified " or the " Expires " headers , unless the CacheIgnoreNoLastMod directive has been used to require otherwise .
If the response includes the " private " option in a " Cache - Control : " header , it will not be stored unless the CacheStorePrivate has been used to require otherwise .
Likewise , if the response includes the " no- store " option in a " Cache - Control : " header , it will not be stored unless the CacheStoreNoStore has been used .
A response will not be stored if it includes a " Vary : " header containing the match - all " * " .
What Should Not be Cached ?
In short , any content which is highly time - sensitive , or which varies depending on the particulars of the request that are not covered by HTTP negotiation , should not be cached .
If you have dynamic content which changes depending on the IP address of the requester , or changes every 5 minutes , it should almost certainly not be cached .
If on the other hand , the content served differs depending on the values of various HTTP headers , it is possible that it might be possible to cache it intelligently through the use of a " Vary " header .
The cache - control directives can be broken down into these general categories :
If a response with a " Vary " header is received by mod_cache when requesting content by the backend it will attempt to handle it intelligently .
If possible , mod_cache will detect the headers attributed in the " Vary " response in future requests and serve the correct cached response .
If for example , a response is received with a vary header such as ; Vary : negotiate , accept - language , accept - charset mod_cache will only serve the cached content to requesters with matching accept - language and accept - charset headers matching those of the original request .
Cache Control Extensions
x - gzip - ok= " "
The Cache - Control header field can be extended through the use of one or more cache - extension tokens , each with an optional assigned value .
Informational extensions ( those which do not require a change in cache behavior ) MAY be added without changing the semantics of other directives .
Behavioral extensions are designed to work by acting as modifiers to the existing base of cache directives .
Both the new directive and the standard directive are supplied , such that applications which do not understand the new directive will default to the behavior specified by the standard directive , and those that understand the new directive will recognize it as modifying the requirements associated with the standard directive .
In this way , extensions to the cache - control directives can be made without requiring changes to the base protocol .
This extension mechanism depends on an HTTP cache obeying all of the cache - control directives defined for its native HTTP - version , obeying certain extensions , and ignoring all directives that it does not understand .
For example , consider a hypothetical new response directive called community which acts as a modifier to the private directive .
We define this new directive to mean that , in addition to any non-shared cache , any cache which is shared only by members of the community named within its value may cache the response .
An origin server wishing to allow the UCI community to use an otherwise private response in their shared cache(s ) could do so by including Cache - Control : private , community = " UCI "
A cache seeing this header field will act correctly even if the cache does not understand the community cache - extension , since it will also see and understand the private directive and thus default to the safe behavior .
Unrecognized cache - directives MUST be ignored ; it is assumed that any cache - directive likely to be unrecognized by an HTTP / 1.1 cache will be combined with standard directives ( or the response 's default cacheability ) such that the cache behavior will remain minimally correct even if the cache does not understand the extension (s ) .
Setting headers with non-Apache setup
JSP
response.setHeader ( " P3P " , " policyref = " http://www.mysite.com/w3c/p3p.xml "
CP=" ALL DSP COR CUR OUR IND PUR " " ) ;
i Planet Web Server
Beginning with iPlanet Web Server 6.0 SP2 ->
Can be accomplished by editing the obj.conf file within the site 's configuration directory .
The following line must be added to obj.conf :
AuthTrans fn=" set- variable " insert - srvhdrs = " P3P=policyref= '
http://www.mydomain.com/path/to/p3</p>p.xml',CP='NON DSP COR CURa TIA ' "
Internet Information Server
The Microsoft Internet Information Server ( IIS ) provides a simple way to add a custom header .
The Microsoft Management Console ( MMC ) can be used to specify a P3P HTTP header .
Within MMC , expand the Internet Information Server line , and then expand the ServerName line .
At Default Web Site , right click and then choose Properties .
Select the HTTP Headers tab .
In Custom HTTP Headers , click Add. Under Custom Header Name , type : P3P
Next , in Custom Header Value , type policyref = " http://www.mydomain.com/path/to/p3p.xml " , CP=" NON DSP COR CURa TIA "
AOLServer
AOLServer becomes customizable through the use of Tcl modules .
A Tcl module is used to create custom HTTP headers for a particular web site .
The webmaster specifies a directory in which the Tcl module resides , and upon start up of the web server , the modules within that directory are initialized as well .
The following directory is commonly used for user - created Tcl modules : / servers / servername / modules / tcl
To create a custom P3P HTTP header , create a file within the Tcl module directory .
The file extension should be .tcl .
Within this file , include the following line : ns_set put [ ns_conn outputheaders ] " P3P " " policyref= " http://www.mydomain.com/path/to/p3p.xml " , CP=" NON CURa TIA "
Caching Overview
The most cacheable representation is one with a long freshness time set .
Validation does help reduce the time that it takes to see a representation , but the cache still has to contact the origin server to see if it 's fresh .
If the cache already knows it 's fresh , it will be served directly .
In order to make the best use of any cache , including effectively using a browser cache , we need to provide some indication of when a resource is no longer valid and should therefore be reacquired .
More specifically , we need the ability to indicate caching rules for Web page objects , ranging from setting appropriate expiration times to indicating when a particular object should not be cached at all .
Fortunately , we have all of these tools at our disposal in the form of HTTP cache controls rules .
The key to cache awareness lies in understanding the two concepts that govern how caches behave : freshness and validation .
Freshness refers to whether or not a cached object is up - to - date , or in more technical terms , whether or not a cached resource is in the same state as that same resource on the origin server .
If the browser or other Web cache lacks sufficient information to confirm that a cached object is fresh , it will always err on the side of caution and treat it as possibly out - of - date or stale .
Validation is the process by which a cache checks with the origin server to see whether one of those potentially stale cached object is fresh or not .
If the server confirms that the cached object is still fresh , the browser will use the local resource ; if not , a fresh copy must be served .
Once the data is downloaded to the cache , it is ' stamped , " indicating where it came from and at what time it was accessed .
It may also be stamped with a third piece of information : when it needs to be reacquired .
But , since most sites do not stamp their data with this explicit cache control information , we 'll assume that our example lacks this information .
The user follows the link to page2.html , which has never been visited before and which references image1.gif , image3.gif , and image4.gif .
In this case , the browser downloads the markup for the new page but the question is : should it re-download image1.gif and image3.gif even though it already has them cached ?
The obvious answer would be no , but , how can we be sure that the images have not changed since we downloaded page1.html ?
Without cache control information , the truth is that we can't .
Therefore , the browser would need to revalidate the image by sending a request to the server in order to check if each image has been modified .
If it has not been changed , the server will send a quick 304 Not Modified response that instructs the browser to go ahead and use the cached image .
But , if it has been modified , a fresh copy of the image will have to be downloaded .
From this basic example , it is apparent that , even when CSS , images , and JavaScript are fresh , we may not get the caching benefit we expect , since the browser still has to make a round trip to the server before it can reuse the cached copy .
The default ' Automatic " setting in Internet Explorer partially reduces this continual chatter between browser and server by skipping revalidation of cached objects during a single browser session .
You will notice that page load time is generally much quicker when revisiting the same page during the same browser session .
To see the performance penalty that would otherwise be incurred by all those 304 Not Modified responses , instead select ' Every visit to the page . "
Minimizing round trips over the Web to revalidate cached items can make a huge difference in browser page load times .
Perhaps the most dramatic illustration of this occurs when a user returns to a site for the second time , after an initial browser session .
In this case , all page objects will have to be revalidated , each costing valuable fractions of a second ( not to mention consuming bandwidth and server cycles ) .
On the other hand , utilizing proper cache control allows each of these previously viewed objects to be served directly out of the browser 's cache without going back to the server .
The effect of adding cache control rules to page objects is often visible at page load time , even with a high bandwidth connection , and users may note that your sites appear to paint faster and that ' flashing " is reduced between subsequent page loads .
Besides improved user perception , the Web server will be offloaded from responding to cache revalidation requests , and thus will be able to better serve new traffic .
However , in order to enjoy the benefits of caching , a developer needs to take time to write out a set of carefully crafted cache control policies that categorize a site 's objects according to their intended lifetimes .
Header Field Definitions
From RFC 2616 section 14.9
Age Header
The Age response - header field conveys the sender 's estimate of the amount of time since the response ( or its revalidation ) was generated at the origin server .
A cached response is " fresh " if its age does not exceed its freshness lifetime .
Age values are non-negative decimal integers , representing time in seconds .
If a cache receives a value larger than the largest positive integer it can represent , or if any of its age calculations overflows , it MUST transmit an Age header with a value of 2147483648 ( 2^31 ) .
An HTTP / 1.1 server that includes a cache MUST include an Age header field in every response generated from its own cache .
Caches SHOULD use an arithmetic type of at least 31 bits of range .
Cache - Control Header
The Cache - Control general - header field is used to specify directives that MUST be obeyed by all caching mechanisms along the request / response chain .
The directives specify behavior intended to prevent caches from adversely interfering with the request or response .
These directives typically override the default caching algorithms .
Cache directives are unidirectional in that the presence of a directive in a request does not imply that the same directive is to be given in the response .
Note that HTTP / 1.0 caches might not implement Cache - Control and might only implement Pragma : no-cache .
Cache directives MUST be passed through by a proxy or gateway application , regardless of their significance to that application , since the directives might be applicable to all recipients along the request / response chain .
It is not possible to specify a cache- directive for a specific cache .
When a directive appears without any 1 # field - name parameter , the directive applies to the entire request or response .
When such a directive appears with a 1 # field - name parameter , it applies only to the named field or fields , and not to the rest of the request or response .
This mechanism supports extensibility ; implementations of future versions of the HTTP protocol might apply these directives to header fields not defined in HTTP / 1.1 .
The cache - control directives can be broken down into these general categories :
Restrictions on what are cacheable ; these may only be imposed by the origin server .
Restrictions on what may be stored by a cache ; these may be imposed by either the origin server or the user agent .
Modifications of the basic expiration mechanism ; these may be imposed by either the origin server or the user agent .
Controls over cache revalidation and reload ; these may only be imposed by a user agent .
Control over transformation of entities .
Extensions to the caching system .
Modifications of the Basic Expiration Mechanism
The expiration time of an entity MAY be specified by the origin server using the Expires header .
Alternatively , it MAY be specified using the max - age directive in a response .
When the max - age cache - control directive is present in a cached response , the response is stale if its current age is greater than the age value given ( in seconds ) at the time of a new request for that resource .
The max - age directive on a response implies that the response is cacheable ( i.e. , " public " ) unless some other , more restrictive cache directive is also present .
If a response includes both an Expires header and a max - age directive , the max - age directive overrides the Expires header , even if the Expires header is more restrictive .
This rule allows an origin server to provide , for a given response , a longer expiration time to an HTTP / 1.1 ( or later ) cache than to an HTTP / 1.0 cache .
This might be useful if certain HTTP / 1.0 caches improperly calculate ages or expiration times , perhaps due to desynchronized clocks .
Many HTTP /1.0 cache implementations will treat an Expires value that is less than or equal to the response Date value as being equivalent to the Cache - Control response directive " no- cache " .
If an HTTP / 1.1 cache receives such a response , and the response does not include a Cache - Control header field , it SHOULD consider the response to be non-cacheable in order to retain compatibility with HTTP / 1.0 servers .
Note :
An origin server might wish to use a relatively new HTTP cache control feature , such as the " private " directive , on a network including older caches that do not understand that feature .
The origin server will need to combine the new feature with an Expires field whose value is less than or equal to the Date value .
This will prevent older caches from improperly caching the response .
s-maxage
If a response includes an s-maxage directive , then for a shared cache ( but not for a private cache ) , the maximum age specified by this directive overrides the maximum age specified by either the max - age directive or the Expires header .
The s-maxage directive also implies the semantics of the proxy - revalidate directive , i.e. , that the shared cache must not use the entry after it becomes stale to respond to a subsequent request without first revalidating it with the origin server .
The s- maxage directive is always ignored by a private cache .
Note that most older caches , not compliant with this specification , do not implement any cache - control directives .
An origin server wishing to use a cache - control directive that restricts , but does not prevent , caching by an HTTP / 1.1 - compliant cache MAY exploit the requirement that the max - age directive overrides the Expires header , and the fact that pre-HTTP / 1.1 - compliant caches do not observe the max - age directive .
Other directives allow a user agent to modify the basic expiration mechanism .
These directives MAY be specified on a request :
max - age Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose age is no greater than the specified time in seconds .
Unless max - stale directive is also included , the client is not willing to accept a stale response .
min-fresh Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response whose freshness lifetime is no less than its current age plus the specified time in seconds .
That is , the client wants a response that will still be fresh for at least the specified number of seconds .
max - stale Indicates that the client is willing to accept a response that has exceeded its expiration time .
If max - stale is assigned a value , then the client is willing to accept a response that has exceeded its expiration time by no more than the specified number of seconds .
If no value is assigned to max - stale , then the client is willing to accept a stale response of any age .
If a cache returns a stale response , either because of a max - stale directive on a request , or because the cache is configured to override the expiration time of a response , the cache MUST attach a Warning header to the stale response , using Warning 110 ( Response is stale ) .
A cache MAY be configured to return stale responses without validation , but only if this does not conflict with any " MUST " - level requirements concerning cache validation ( e.g. , a " must - revalidate " cache - control directive ) .
If both the new request and the cached entry include " max - age " directives , then the lesser of the two values is used for determining the freshness of the cached entry for that request .
Cache Revalidation and Reload Controls
Sometimes a user agent might want or need to insist that a cache revalidate its cache entry with the origin server ( and not just with the next cache along the path to the origin server ) , or to reload its cache entry from the origin server .
End - to - end revalidation might be necessary if either the cache or the origin server has overestimated the expiration time of the cached response .
End - to - end reload may be necessary if the cache entry has become corrupted for some reason .
End - to - end revalidation may be requested either when the client does not have its own local cached copy , in which case we call it " unspecified end - to - end revalidation " , or when the client does have a local cached copy , in which case we call it " specific end - to - end revalidation . "
The client can specify these three kinds of action using Cache - Control request directives :
End - to - end reload
The request includes a " no- cache " cache - control directive or , for compatibility with HTTP / 1.0 clients , " Pragma : no - cache " .
Field names MUST NOT be included with the no-cache directive in a request .
The server MUST NOT use a cached copy when responding to such a request .
Specific end - to - end revalidation
The request includes a " max- age=0 " cache - control directive , which forces each cache along the path to the origin server to revalidate its own entry , if any , with the next cache or server .
The initial request includes a cache - validating conditional with the client 's current validator .
Unspecified end - to - end revalidation
The request includes " max - age=0 " cache - control directive , which forces each cache along the path to the origin server to revalidate its own entry , if any , with the next cache or server .
The initial request does not include a cache - validating conditional ; the first cache along the path ( if any ) that holds a cache entry for this resource includes a cache - validating conditional with its current validator .
max - age
When an intermediate cache is forced , by means of a max - age=0 directive , to revalidate its own cache entry , and the client has supplied its own validator in the request , the supplied validator might differ from the validator currently stored with the cache entry .
In this case , the cache MAY use either validator in making its own request without affecting semantic transparency .
However , the choice of validator might affect performance .
The best approach is for the intermediate cache to use its own validator when making its request .
If the server replies with 304 ( Not Modified ) , then the cache can return its now validated copy to the client with a 200 ( OK ) response .
If the server replies with a new entity and cache validator , however , the intermediate cache can compare the returned validator with the one provided in the client 's request , using the strong comparison function .
If the client 's validator is equal to the origin server 's , then the intermediate cache simply returns 304 ( Not Modified ) .
Otherwise , it returns the new entity with a 200 ( OK ) response .
If a request includes the no-cache directive , it SHOULD NOT include min-fresh , max - stale , or max - age .
only - if - cached
In some cases , such as times of extremely poor network connectivity , a client may want a cache to return only those responses that it currently has stored , and not to reload or revalidate with the origin server .
To do this , the client may include the only - if - cached directive in a request .
If it receives this directive , a cache SHOULD either respond using a cached entry that is consistent with the other constraints of the request , or respond with a 504 ( Gateway Timeout ) status .
However , if a group of caches is being operated as a unified system with good internal connectivity , such a request MAY be forwarded within that group of caches .
must - revalidate Because a cache MAY be configured to ignore a server 's specified expiration time , and because a client request MAY include a max - stale directive ( which has a similar effect ) , the protocol also includes a mechanism for the origin server to require revalidation of a cache entry on any subsequent use .
When the must - revalidate directive is present in a response received by a cache , that cache MUST NOT use the entry after it becomes stale to respond to a subsequent request without first revalidating it with the origin server .
( I.e. , the cache MUST do an end - to - end revalidation every time , if , based solely on the origin server 's Expires or max - age value , the cached response is stale . )
The must - revalidate directive is necessary to support reliable operation for certain protocol features .
In all circumstances an HTTP / 1.1 cache MUST obey the must - revalidate directive ; in particular , if the cache cannot reach the origin server for any reason , it MUST generate a 504 ( Gateway Timeout ) response .
Servers SHOULD send the must - revalidate directive if and only if failure to revalidate a request on the entity could result in incorrect operation , such as a silently unexecuted financial transaction .
Recipients MUST NOT take any automated action that violates this directive , and MUST NOT automatically provide an unvalidated copy of the entity if revalidation fails .
Although this is not recommended , user agents operating under severe connectivity constraints MAY violate this directive but , if so , MUST explicitly warn the user that an unvalidated response has been provided .
The warning MUST be provided on each unvalidated access , and SHOULD require explicit user confirmation .
proxy - revalidate
The proxy - revalidate directive has the same meaning as the must - revalidate directive , except that it does not apply to non-shared user agent caches .
It can be used on a response to an authenticated request to permit the user 's cache to store and later return the response without needing to revalidate it ( since it has already been authenticated once by that user ) , while still requiring proxies that service many users to revalidate each time ( in order to make sure that each user has been authenticated ) .
Note that such authenticated responses also need the public cache control directive in order to allow them to be cached at all .
No - Transform Directive
no - transform Implementors of intermediate caches ( proxies ) have found it useful to convert the media type of certain entity bodies .
A non- transparent proxy might , for example , convert between image formats in order to save cache space or to reduce the amount of traffic on a slow link .
Serious operational problems occur , however , when these transformations are applied to entity bodies intended for certain kinds of applications .
For example , applications for medical imaging , scientific data analysis and those using end - to - end authentication , all depend on receiving an entity body that is bit for bit identical to the original entity - body .
Therefore , if a message includes the no-transform directive , an intermediate cache or proxy MUST NOT change those headers as being subject to the no-transform directive .
This implies that the cache or proxy MUST NOT change any aspect of the entity - body that is specified by these headers , including the value of the entity - body itself .
Cache Control Extensions
The Cache - Control header field can be extended through the use of one or more cache - extension tokens , each with an optional assigned value .
Informational extensions ( those which do not require a change in cache behavior ) MAY be added without changing the semantics of other directives .
Behavioral extensions are designed to work by acting as modifiers to the existing base of cache directives .
Both the new directive and the standard directive are supplied , such that applications which do not understand the new directive will default to the behavior specified by the standard directive , and those that understand the new directive will recognize it as modifying the requirements associated with the standard directive .
In this way , extensions to the cache - control directives can be made without requiring changes to the base protocol .
This extension mechanism depends on an HTTP cache obeying all of the cache - control directives defined for its native HTTP - version , obeying certain extensions , and ignoring all directives that it does not understand .
For example , consider a hypothetical new response directive called community which acts as a modifier to the private directive .
We define this new directive to mean that , in addition to any non-shared cache , any cache which is shared only by members of the community named within its value may cache the response .
An origin server wishing to allow the UCI community to use an otherwise private response in their shared cache(s ) could do so by including
Cache - Control : private , community = " UCI "
A cache seeing this header field will act correctly even if the cache does not understand the community cache - extension , since it will also see and understand the private directive and thus default to the safe behavior .
Unrecognized cache - directives MUST be ignored ; it is assumed that any cache - directive likely to be unrecognized by an HTTP / 1.1 cache will be combined with standard directives ( or the response 's default cacheability ) such that the cache behavior will remain minimally correct even if the cache does not understand the extension (s ) .
Connection
The Connection general - header field allows the sender to specify options that are desired for that particular connection and MUST NOT be communicated by proxies over further connections .
The Connection header has the following grammar :
Connection = " Connection " " : " 1 # ( connection - token ) connection - token = token
HTTP /1.1 proxies MUST parse the Connection header field before a message is forwarded and , for each connection - token in this field , remove any header field (s ) from the message with the same name as the connection - token .
Connection options are signaled by the presence of a connection - token in the Connection header field , not by any corresponding additional header field (s ) , since the additional header field may not be sent if there are no parameters associated with that connection option .
Message headers listed in the Connection header MUST NOT include end - to - end headers , such as Cache - Control .
HTTP /1.1 defines the " close " connection option for the sender to signal that the connection will be closed after completion of the response .
For example ,
Connection : close
in either the request or the response header fields indicates that the connection SHOULD NOT be considered `persistent ' after the current request / response is complete .
HTTP /1.1 applications that do not support persistent connections MUST include the " close " connection option in every message .
A system receiving an HTTP / 1.0 ( or lower - version ) message that includes a Connection header MUST , for each connection - token in this field , remove and ignore any header field (s ) from the message with the same name as the connection - token .
This protects against mistaken forwarding of such header fields by pre-HTTP / 1.1 proxies .
The Content - MD5 entity - header field , as defined in RFC 1864 [ 23 ] , is an MD5 digest of the entity - body for the purpose of providing an end - to - end message integrity check ( MIC ) of the entity - body .
( Note : a MIC is good for detecting accidental modification of the entity - body in transit , but is not proof against malicious attacks . )
Content - MD5 = " Content - MD5 " " : " md5 - digest md5 - digest = < base64 of 128 bit MD5 digest as per RFC 1864 >
The Content - MD5 header field MAY be generated by an origin server or client to function as an integrity check of the entity - body .
Only origin servers or clients MAY generate the Content - MD5 header field ; proxies and gateways MUST NOT generate it , as this would defeat its value as an end - to - end integrity check .
Any recipient of the entity - body , including gateways and proxies , MAY check that the digest value in this header field matches that of the entity - body as received .
The MD5 digest is computed based on the content of the entity - body , including any content - coding that has been applied , but not including any transfer - encoding applied to the message - body .
If the message is received with a transfer - encoding , that encoding MUST be removed prior to checking the Content - MD5 value against the received entity .
This has the result that the digest is computed on the octets of the entity - body exactly as , and in the order that , they would be sent if no transfer - encoding were being applied .
HTTP extends RFC 1864 to permit the digest to be computed for MIME composite media - types ( e.g. , multipart / * and message / rfc822 ) , but this does not change how the digest is computed as defined in the preceding paragraph .
There are several consequences of this .
The entity - body for composite types MAY contain many body - parts , each with its own MIME and HTTP headers ( including Content - MD5 , Content - Transfer - Encoding , and Content - Encoding headers ) .
If a body - part has a Content - Transfer - Encoding or Content - Encoding header , it is assumed that the content of the body - part has had the encoding applied , and the body - part is included in the Content - MD5 digest as is -- i.e. , after the application .
The Transfer - Encoding header field is not allowed within body - parts .
Conversion of all line breaks to CRLF MUST NOT be done before computing or checking the digest : the line break convention used in the text actually transmitted MUST be left unaltered when computing the digest .
Note : while the definition of Content - MD5 is exactly the same for HTTP as in RFC 1864 for MIME entity - bodies , there are several ways in which the application of Content - MD5 to HTTP entity - bodies differs from its application to MIME entity - bodies .
One is that HTTP , unlike MIME , does not use Content - Transfer - Encoding , and does use Transfer - Encoding and Content - Encoding .
Another is that HTTP more frequently uses binary content types than MIME , so it is worth noting that , in such cases , the byte order used to compute the digest is the transmission byte order defined for the type .
Lastly , HTTP allows transmission of text types with any of several line break conventions and not just the canonical form using CRLF .
The Date general - header field represents the date and time at which the message was originated , having the same semantics as orig - date in RFC 822 .
The field value is an HTTP - date ; it MUST be sent in RFC 1123 [ 8 ] - date format .
Date : Tue , 15 Nov 1994 08:12:31 GMT
Origin servers MUST include a Date header field in all responses , except in these cases :
If the response status code is 100 ( Continue ) or 101 ( Switching Protocols ) , the response MAY include a Date header field , at the server 's option .
If the response status code conveys a server error , e.g. 500 ( Internal Server Error ) or 503 ( Service Unavailable ) , and it is inconvenient or impossible to generate a valid Date .
If the server does not have a clock that can provide a reasonable approximation of the current time , its responses MUST NOT include a Date header field .
In this case , the rules in section 14.18.1 MUST be followed .
A received message that does not have a Date header field MUST be assigned one by the recipient if the message will be cached by that recipient or gatewayed via a protocol which requires a Date .
An HTTP implementation without a clock MUST NOT cache responses without revalidating them on every use .
An HTTP cache , especially a shared cache , SHOULD use a mechanism , such as NTP [ 28 ] , to synchronize its clock with a reliable external standard .
Clients SHOULD only send a Date header field in messages that include an entity - body , as in the case of the PUT and POST requests , and even then it is optional .
A client without a clock MUST NOT send a Date header field in a request .
The HTTP - date sent in a Date header SHOULD NOT represent a date and time subsequent to the generation of the message .
It SHOULD represent the best available approximation of the date and time of message generation , unless the implementation has no means of generating a reasonably accurate date and time .
In theory , the date ought to represent the moment just before the entity is generated .
In practice , the date can be generated at any time during the message origination without affecting its semantic value .
Clockless Origin Server Operation
Some origin server implementations might not have a clock available .
An origin server without a clock MUST NOT assign Expires or Last - Modified values to a response , unless these values were associated with the resource by a system or user with a reliable clock .
It MAY assign an Expires value that is known , at or before server configuration time , to be in the past ( this allows " pre-expiration " of responses without storing separate Expires values for each resource ) .
ETag
The ETag response - header field provides the current value of the entity tag for the requested variant .
The entity tag MAY be used for comparison with other entities from the same resource .
ETag = " ETag " " : " entity - tag
Examples :
ETag : " xyzzy " ETag : W / " xyzzy " ETag : " "
Expires
The Expires entity - header field gives the date / time after which the response is considered stale .
A stale cache entry may not normally be returned by a cache ( either a proxy cache or a user agent cache ) unless it is first validated with the origin server ( or with an intermediate cache that has a fresh copy of the entity ) .
The presence of an Expires field does not imply that the original resource will change or cease to exist at , before , or after that time .
The format is an absolute date and time as defined by HTTP - date ; it MUST be in RFC 1123 date format :
Expires = " Expires " " : " HTTP - date
An example of its use is
Expires : Thu , 01 Dec 1994 16:00:00 GMT
NOTE : If a response includes a Cache - Control field with the max - age directive , that directive overrides the Expires field .
HTTP /1.1 clients and caches MUST treat other invalid date formats , especially including the value " 0 " , as in the past ( i.e. , " already expired " ) .
To mark a response as " already expired , " an origin server sends an Expires date that is equal to the Date header value .
To mark a response as " never expires , " an origin server sends an Expires date approximately one year from the time the response is sent .
HTTP /1.1 servers SHOULD NOT send Expires dates more than one year in the future .
The presence of an Expires header field with a date value of some time in the future on a response that otherwise would by default be non-cacheable indicates that the response is cacheable , unless indicated otherwise by a Cache - Control header field
The If - Match request - header field is used with a method to make it conditional .
A client that has one or more entities previously obtained from the resource can verify that one of those entities is current by including a list of their associated entity tags in the If - Match header field .
Entity tags are defined in section 3.11 .
The purpose of this feature is to allow efficient updates of cached information with a minimum amount of transaction overhead .
It is also used , on updating requests , to prevent inadvertent modification of the wrong version of a resource .
As a special case , the value " * " matches any current entity of the resource .
If any of the entity tags match the entity tag of the entity that would have been returned in the response to a similar GET request ( without the If - Match header ) on that resource , or if " * " is given and any current entity exists for that resource , then the server MAY perform the requested method as if the If - Match header field did not exist .
If none of the entity tags match , or if " * " is given and no current entity exists , the server MUST NOT perform the requested method , and MUST return a 412 ( Precondition Failed ) response .
This behavior is most useful when the client wants to prevent an updating method , such as PUT , from modifying a resource that has changed since the client last retrieved it .
If the request would , without the If - Match header field , result in anything other than a 2xx or 412 status , then the If - Match header MUST be ignored .
The meaning of " If - Match : * " is that the method SHOULD be performed if the representation selected by the origin server ( or by a cache , possibly using the Vary mechanism , see section 14.44 ) exists , and MUST NOT be performed if the representation does not exist .
A request intended to update a resource ( e.g. , a PUT ) MAY include an If - Match header field to signal that the request method MUST NOT be applied if the entity corresponding to the If - Match value ( a single entity tag ) is no longer a representation of that resource .
This allows the user to indicate that they do not wish the request to be successful if the resource has been changed without their knowledge .
Examples :
The If - Modified - Since request - header field is used with a method to make it conditional : if the requested variant has not been modified since the time specified in this field , an entity will not be returned from the server ; instead , a 304 ( not modified ) response will be returned without any message - body .
If - Modified - Since = " If - Modified - Since " " : " HTTP - date
An example of the field is :
If - Modified - Since : Sat , 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT
A GET method with an If - Modified - Since header and no Range header requests that the identified entity be transferred only if it has been modified since the date given by the If - Modified - Since header .
The algorithm for determining this includes the following cases :
If the request would normally result in anything other than a 200 ( OK ) status , or if the passed If - Modified - Since date is invalid , the response is exactly the same as for a normal GET .
A date which is later than the server 's current time is invalid .
If the variant has been modified since the If - Modified - Since date , the response is exactly the same as for a normal GET .
If the variant has not been modified since a valid If - Modified - Since date , the server SHOULD return a 304 ( Not Modified ) response .
The purpose of this feature is to allow efficient updates of cached information with a minimum amount of transaction overhead .
NOTE : The Range request - header field modifies the meaning of If - Modified - Since .
NOTE : If - Modified - Since times are interpreted by the server , whose clock might not be synchronized with the client .
NOTE : When handling an If - Modified - Since header field , some servers will use an exact date comparison function , rather than a less - than function , for deciding whether to send a 304 ( Not Modified ) response .
To get best results when sending an If - Modified - Since header field for cache validation , clients are advised to use the exact date string received in a previous Last - Modified header field whenever possible .
NOTE : If a client uses an arbitrary date in the If - Modified - Since header instead of a date taken from the Last - Modified header for the same request , the client should be aware of the fact that this date is interpreted in the server 's understanding of time .
The client should consider unsynchronized clocks and rounding problems due to the different encodings of time between the client and server .
This includes the possibility of race conditions if the document has changed between the time it was first requested and the If - Modified - Since date of a subsequent request , and the possibility of clock - skew - related problems if the If - Modified - Since date is derived from the client 's clock without correction to the server 's clock .
Corrections for different time bases between client and server are at best approximate due to network latency .
The If - None - Match request - header field is used with a method to make it conditional .
A client that has one or more entities previously obtained from the resource can verify that none of those entities is current by including a list of their associated entity tags in the If - None - Match header field .
The purpose of this feature is to allow efficient updates of cached information with a minimum amount of transaction overhead .
It is also used to prevent a method ( e.g. PUT ) from inadvertently modifying an existing resource when the client believes that the resource does not exist .
If any of the entity tags match the entity tag of the entity that would have been returned in the response to a similar GET request ( without the If - None - Match header ) on that resource , or if " * " is given and any current entity exists for that resource , then the server MUST NOT perform the requested method , unless required to do so because the resource 's modification date fails to match that supplied in an If - Modified - Since header field in the request .
Instead , if the request method was GET or HEAD , the server SHOULD respond with a 304 ( Not Modified ) response , including the cache - related header fields ( particularly ETag ) of one of the entities that matched .
For all other request methods , the server MUST respond with a status of 412 ( Precondition Failed ) .
If none of the entity tags match , then the server MAY perform the requested method as if the If - None - Match header field did not exist , but MUST also ignore any If - Modified - Since header field (s ) in the request .
That is , if no entity tags match , then the server MUST NOT return a 304 ( Not Modified ) response .
If the request would , without the If - None - Match header field , result in anything other than a 2xx or 304 status , then the If - None - Match header MUST be ignored .
The meaning of " If - None - Match : * " is that the method MUST NOT be performed if the representation selected by the origin server ( or by a cache , possibly using the Vary mechanism ) exists , and SHOULD be performed if the representation does not exist .
This feature is intended to be useful in preventing races between PUT operations .
Examples :
If - None -Match : " xyzzy " If - None - Match : W / " xyzzy " If - None - Match : " xyzzy " , " r2d2xxxx " , " c3 piozzzz " If - None - Match : W / " xyzzy " , W / " r2d2xxxx " , W / " c3 piozzzz " If - None - Match : *
If a client has a partial copy of an entity in its cache , and wishes to have an up - to - date copy of the entire entity in its cache , it could use the Range request - header with a conditional GET ( using either or both of If - Unmodified - Since and If - Match . )
However , if the condition fails because the entity has been modified , the client would then have to make a second request to obtain the entire current entity - body .
The If - Range header allows a client to " short - circuit " the second request .
Informally , its meaning is ' if the entity is unchanged , send me the part (s ) that I 'm missing ; otherwise , send the entire new entity ' .
If the client has no entity tag for an entity , but does have a Last - Modified date , it MAY use that date in an If - Range header .
( The server can distinguish between a valid HTTP - date and any form of entity - tag by examining no more than two characters . )
The If - Range header SHOULD only be used together with a Range header , and MUST be ignored if the request does not include a Range header , or if the server does not support the sub - range operation .
If the entity tag given in the If - Range header matches the current entity tag for the entity , then the server SHOULD provide the specified sub-range of the entity using a 206 ( Partial content ) response .
If the entity tag does not match , then the server SHOULD return the entire entity using a 200 ( OK ) response .
The If - Unmodified - Since request - header field is used with a method to make it conditional .
If the requested resource has not been modified since the time specified in this field , the server SHOULD perform the requested operation as if the If - Unmodified - Since header were not present .
If the requested variant has been modified since the specified time , the server MUST NOT perform the requested operation , and MUST return a 412 ( Precondition Failed ) .
An example of the field is : If - Unmodified - Since : Sat , 29 Oct 1994 19:43:31 GMT
If the request normally ( i.e. , without the If - Unmodified - Since header ) would result in anything other than a 2xx or 412 status , the If - Unmodified - Since header SHOULD be ignored .
If the specified date is invalid , the header is ignored .
The result of a request having both an If - Unmodified - Since header field and either an If - None - Match or an If - Modified - Since header fields is undefined by this specification .
The Last - Modified entity - header field indicates the date and time at which the origin server believes the variant was last modified .
Ex. Last - Modified : Tue , 15 Nov 1994 12:45:26 GMT
The exact meaning of this header field depends on the implementation of the origin server and the nature of the original resource .
For files , it may be just the file system last - modified time .
For entities with dynamically included parts , it may be the most recent of the set of last - modify times for its component parts .
For database gateways , it may be the last - update time stamp of the record .
For virtual objects , it may be the last time the internal state changed .
An origin server MUST NOT send a Last - Modified date which is later than the server 's time of message origination .
In such cases , where the resource 's last modification would indicate some time in the future , the server MUST replace that date with the message origination date .
An origin server SHOULD obtain the Last - Modified value of the entity as close as possible to the time that it generates the Date value of its response .
This allows a recipient to make an accurate assessment of the entity 's modification time , especially if the entity changes near the time that the response is generated .
Pragma
The Pragma general - header field is used to include implementation - specific directives that might apply to any recipient along the request / response chain .
All pragma directives specify optional behavior from the viewpoint of the protocol ; however , some systems MAY require that behavior be consistent with the directives .
Pragma = " Pragma " " : " 1 # pragma - directive pragma - directive = " no- cache " | extension - pragma extension - pragma = token [ " = " ( token | quoted - string ) ]
When the no-cache directive is present in a request message , an application SHOULD forward the request toward the origin server even if it has a cached copy of what is being requested .
This pragma directive has the same semantics as the no-cache cache - directive and is defined here for backward compatibility with HTTP / 1.0 .
Clients SHOULD include both header fields when a no - cache request is sent to a server not known to be HTTP / 1.1 compliant .
Pragma directives MUST be passed through by a proxy or gateway application , regardless of their significance to that application , since the directives might be applicable to all recipients along the request / response chain .
It is not possible to specify a pragma for a specific recipient ; however , any pragma directive not relevant to a recipient SHOULD be ignored by that recipient .
HTTP /1.1 caches SHOULD treat " Pragma : no - cache " as if the client had sent " Cache - Control : no - cache " .
No new Pragma directives will be defined in HTTP .
NOTE : because the meaning of " Pragma : no - cache as a response header field is not actually specified , it does not provide a reliable replacement for " Cache - Control : no - cache " in a response
Vary
The Vary field value indicates the set of request - header fields that fully determines , while the response is fresh , whether a cache is permitted to use the response to reply to a subsequent request without revalidation .
For uncacheable or stale responses , the Vary field value advises the user agent about the criteria that were used to select the representation .
A Vary field value of " * " implies that a cache cannot determine from the request headers of a subsequent request whether this response is the appropriate representation .
An HTTP / 1.1 server SHOULD include a Vary header field with any cacheable response that is subject to server - driven negotiation .
Doing so allows a cache to properly interpret future requests on that resource and informs the user agent about the presence of negotiation on that resource .
A server MAY include a Vary header field with a non-cacheable response that is subject to server - driven negotiation , since this might provide the user agent with useful information about the dimensions over which the response varies at the time of the response .
A Vary field value consisting of a list of field - names signals that the representation selected for the response is based on a selection algorithm which considers ONLY the listed request - header field values in selecting the most appropriate representation .
A cache MAY assume that the same selection will be made for future requests with the same values for the listed field names , for the duration of time for which the response is fresh .
Via
The Via general - header field MUST be used by gateways and proxies to indicate the intermediate protocols and recipients between the user agent and the server on requests , and between the origin server and the client on responses .
It is analogous to the " Received " field of RFC 822 [ 9 ] and is intended to be used for tracking message forwards , avoiding request loops , and identifying the protocol capabilities of all senders along the request / response chain .
Comments MAY be used in the Via header field to identify the software of the recipient proxy or gateway , analogous to the User - Agent and Server header fields .
However , all comments in the Via field are optional and MAY be removed by any recipient prior to forwarding the message .
For example , a request message could be sent from an HTTP / 1.0 user agent to an internal proxy code - named " fred " , which uses HTTP / 1.1 to forward the request to a public proxy at nowhere.com , which completes the request by forwarding it to the origin server at www.ics.uci.edu.
The request received by www.ics.uci.edu would then have the following Via header field : Via : 1.0 fred , 1.1 nowhere.com ( Apache / 1.1 )
PHP Concepts Overview
How to force browser to use already downloaded and cached file .
If you have images in DB , they will reload each time user views them .
To prevent this , web server must identify each file with ID .
When sending a file , web server attaches ID of the file in header called ETag. header ( " ETag : " uniqueID " ) ;
When requesting file , browser checks if the file was already downloaded .
If cached file is found , server sends the ID with the file request to server .
Server checks if the IDs match and if they do , sends back header ( " HTTP /1.1 304 Not Modified " ) ; else Server sends the file normally .
<?php $ file = getFileFromDB ( ) ; // generate unique ID $ hash = md5 ( $ file ) ; $ headers = getallheaders ( ) ; // if Browser sent ID , we check if they match if ( ereg ( $ hash , $ headers [ ' If - None - Match ' ] ) ) { header ( ' HTTP /1.1 304 Not Modified ' ) ; } else { header ( " ETag : $ hash " ) ; header ( " Accept - Ranges : bytes " ) ; header ( " Content - Length : " .strlen ( $ file ) ) ; header ( " Content - Type : $ mime " ) ; header ( " Content - Disposition : inline ; filename= $ filename ; " ) ; echo $ file ; } exit ( ) ; ?>

Cache - control Mechanisms
The basic cache mechanisms in HTTP / 1.1 ( server - specified expiration times and validators ) are implicit directives to caches .
In some cases , a server or client might need to provide explicit directives to the HTTP caches .
We use the Cache - Control header for this purpose .
The Cache - Control header allows a client or server to transmit a variety of directives in either requests or responses .
These directives typically override the default caching algorithms .
As a general rule , if there is any apparent conflict between header values , the most restrictive interpretation is applied ( that is , the one that is most likely to preserve semantic transparency ) .
However , in some cases , cache - control directives are explicitly specified as weakening the approximation of semantic transparency ( for example , " max - stale " or " public " ) .
Explicit User Agent Warnings
Many user agents make it possible for users to override the basic caching mechanisms .
For example , the user agent might allow the user to specify that cached entities ( even explicitly stale ones ) are never validated .
Or the user agent might habitually add " Cache - Control : max - stale=3600 " to every request .
The user agent SHOULD NOT default to either non-transparent behavior , or behavior that results in abnormally ineffective caching , but MAY be explicitly configured to do so by an explicit action of the user .
If the user has overridden the basic caching mechanisms , the user agent SHOULD explicitly indicate to the user whenever this results in the display of information that might not meet the server 's transparency requirements ( in particular , if the displayed entity is known to be stale ) .
Since the protocol normally allows the user agent to determine if responses are stale or not , this indication need only be displayed when this actually happens .
The indication need not be a dialog box ; it could be an icon ( for example , a picture of a rotting fish ) or some other indicator .
If the user has overridden the caching mechanisms in a way that would abnormally reduce the effectiveness of caches , the user agent SHOULD continually indicate this state to the user ( for example , by a display of a picture of currency in flames ) so that the user does not inadvertently consume excess resources or suffer from excessive latency .
Exceptions to the Rules and Warnings
In some cases , the operator of a cache MAY choose to configure it to return stale responses even when not requested by clients .
This decision ought not be made lightly , but may be necessary for reasons of availability or performance , especially when the cache is poorly connected to the origin server .
Whenever a cache returns a stale response , it MUST mark it as such ( using a Warning header ) enabling the client software to alert the user that there might be a potential problem .
It also allows the user agent to take steps to obtain a first - hand or fresh response .
For this reason , a cache SHOULD NOT return a stale response if the client explicitly requests a first - hand or fresh one , unless it is impossible to comply for technical or policy reasons .
Client - controlled Behavior
While the origin server ( and to a lesser extent , intermediate caches , by their contribution to the age of a response ) are the primary source of expiration information , in some cases the client might need to control a cache 's decision about whether to return a cached response without validating it .
Clients do this using several directives of the Cache - Control header .
A client 's request MAY specify the maximum age it is willing to accept of an unvalidated response ; specifying a value of zero forces the cache(s ) to revalidate all responses .
A client MAY also specify the minimum time remaining before a response expires .
Both of these options increase constraints on the behavior of caches , and so cannot further relax the cache 's approximation of semantic transparency .
A client MAY also specify that it will accept stale responses , up to some maximum amount of staleness .
This loosens the constraints on the caches , and so might violate the origin server 's specified constraints on semantic transparency , but might be necessary to support disconnected operation , or high availability in the face of poor connectivity .
Server - Specified Expiration
HTTP caching works best when caches can entirely avoid making requests to the origin server .
The primary mechanism for avoiding requests is for an origin server to provide an explicit expiration time in the future , indicating that a response MAY be used to satisfy subsequent requests .
In other words , a cache can return a fresh response without first contacting the server .
Our expectation is that servers will assign future explicit expiration times to responses in the belief that the entity is not likely to change , in a semantically significant way , before the expiration time is reached .
This normally preserves semantic transparency , as long as the server 's expiration times are carefully chosen .
The expiration mechanism applies only to responses taken from a cache and not to first - hand responses forwarded immediately to the requesting client .
If an origin server wishes to force a semantically transparent cache to validate every request , it MAY assign an explicit expiration time in the past .
This means that the response is always stale , and so the cache SHOULD validate it before using it for subsequent requests .
See section 14.9.4 for a more restrictive way to force revalidation .
If an origin server wishes to force any HTTP / 1.1 cache , no matter how it is configured , to validate every request , it SHOULD use the " must - revalidate " cache - control directive .
Servers specify explicit expiration times using either the Expires header , or the max - age directive of the Cache - Control header .
An expiration time cannot be used to force a user agent to refresh its display or reload a resource ; its semantics apply only to caching mechanisms , and such mechanisms need only check a resource 's expiration status when a new request for that resource is initiated .
Heuristic Expiration
Since origin servers do not always provide explicit expiration times , HTTP caches typically assign heuristic expiration times , employing algorithms that use other header values ( such as the Last - Modified time ) to estimate a plausible expiration time .
The HTTP / 1.1 specification does not provide specific algorithms , but does impose worst - case constraints on their results .
Since heuristic expiration times might compromise semantic transparency , they ought to used cautiously , and we encourage origin servers to provide explicit expiration times as much as possible .
Age Calculations
In order to know if a cached entry is fresh , a cache needs to know if its age exceeds its freshness lifetime .
Describes how to calculate the age of a response or cache entry .
In this discussion , we use the term " now " to mean " the current value of the clock at the host performing the calculation . "
Hosts that use HTTP , but especially hosts running origin servers and caches , SHOULD use NTP [ 28 ] or some similar protocol to synchronize their clocks to a globally accurate time standard .
HTTP /1.1 requires origin servers to send a Date header , if possible , with every response , giving the time at which the response was generated .
We use the term " date_value " to denote the value of the Date header , in a form appropriate for arithmetic operations .
HTTP /1.1 uses the Age response - header to convey the estimated age of the response message when obtained from a cache .
The Age field value is the cache 's estimate of the amount of time since the response was generated or revalidated by the origin server .
In essence , the Age value is the sum of the time that the response has been resident in each of the caches along the path from the origin server , plus the amount of time it has been in transit along network paths .
We use the term " age_value " to denote the value of the Age header , in a form appropriate for arithmetic operations .
A response's age can be calculated in two entirely independent ways :
now minus date_value , if the local clock is reasonably well synchronized to the origin server 's clock .
If the result is negative , the result is replaced by zero .
age_value , if all of the caches along the response path implement HTTP / 1.1 .
Given that we have two independent ways to compute the age of a response when it is received , we can combine these as corrected_received_age = max ( now - date_value , age_value ) and as long as we have either nearly synchronized clocks or all - HTTP / 1.1 paths , one gets a reliable ( conservative ) result .
Because of network - imposed delays , some significant interval might pass between the time that a server generates a response and the time it is received at the next outbound cache or client .
If uncorrected , this delay could result in improperly low ages .
Because the request that resulted in the returned Age value must have been initiated prior to that Age value 's generation , we can correct for delays imposed by the network by recording the time at which the request was initiated .
Then , when an Age value is received , it MUST be interpreted relative to the time the request was initiated , not the time that the response was received .
This algorithm results in conservative behavior no matter how much delay is experienced .
So , we compute : corrected_initial_age = corrected_received_age + ( now - request_time ) where " request_time " is the time ( according to the local clock ) when the request that elicited this response was sent .
Summary of age calculation algorithm , when a cache receives a response :
age_value the value of Age : header received by the cache with this response date_value the value of the origin server 's Date : header request_time the ( local ) time when the cache made the request that resulted in this cached response response_time the ( local ) time when the cache received the response now the current ( local ) time
apparent_age = max ( 0 , response_time - date_value ) ; corrected_received_age = max ( apparent_age , age_value ) ; response_delay = response_time - request_time ; corrected_initial_age = corrected_received_age + response_delay ; resident_time = now - response_time ; current_age = corrected_initial_age + resident_time ;
The current_age of a cache entry is calculated by adding the amount of time ( in seconds ) since the cache entry was last validated by the origin server to the corrected_initial_age .
When a response is generated from a cache entry , the cache MUST include a single Age header field in the response with a value equal to the cache entry 's current_age .
The presence of an Age header field in a response implies that a response is not first - hand .
However , the converse is not true , since the lack of an Age header field in a response does not imply that the respons
A Performance Comparison of Judy to Hash Tables
jump to the pretty pictures
Judy Pros and Cons
Numerous claims about Judy 's performance are made in the Judy whitepaper .
I do n't think any of those claims are wrong .
However , it does not appear that sufficient effort was put in benchmarking Judy against other data structures .
Now , it is unlikely there is another data structure that is both as fast and as small as Judy is .
But it is easy to come away from reading about Judy getting the impression that because it is small ( and hence more cache - friendly ) , it will be faster than something larger .
( For example , look at the discussion about " tunnelling under " the time / space trade - off curve . )
This is not necessarily the case ; if in the end what matters is performance , the only thing to do is measure performance , not space .
There are a few potential disadvantages to keep in mind about the Judy approach .
Its author argues that approaching the problem as engineering means accepting that complexity is how you get good performance ; simplicity is for theoreticians .
But this complexity leads to things like a data structure with 20,000 lines of code designed on the assumption that a cache - line is 64 bytes being used primarily on machines with 32 - byte cache lines ; a redesign optimized for 32 - byte cache lines would come close to starting from scratch .
Additionally , some of Judy 's space and speed improvements come from strategies that could be used by any data structure but are n't because they 're not good software engineering .
Most abstract data types give you a fixed pointer good for the life of that datatype ; Judy omits one level of indirection and gives you a pointer that may change during the life of the associative array as it grows and shrinks ; if you want multiple objects to have pointers to the same Judy array , you 'll need to wrap the changing - pointer in another data structure -- just like how data structures are normally .
Judy saves space by encoding information in the bottom bits of the pointer ; this would interfere with any other use of the bottom bits , e.g. in a language that uses tagged boxed data like OCaml .
A Simple Hash Table
The Judy white paper mentions comparisons to hash tables , but from the description they appear to have tested fixed - size hash tables with external chaining .
Such structures have performance O ( N ) with a very small constant , 1 / M where M is the size of the hash table .
Proper hash tables have performance O ( 1 ) .
For this comparison , I wrote a hash table data type with the same interface as JudyL , an associative array type whose key and value are both 32 bits .
I used a hash table with secondary hashing ( internal chaining ) , using a table size of a power of two that periodically doubles , rehashing all the elements .
The arbitrary doubling threshhold I picked for the initial implementation was 65 % full , and although I included a command - line option for tuning it I never did .
For the first time in my life I also wrote code that causes the table to shrink by a factor of two ; the default here is if it gets under 30 % full .
( The difference between 65 % and 2*30 % is intentional , to avoid hash - table - resize thrashing . )
Also , the hash table rehashes all the elements if the table reaches 80 % full of real entries and deleted markers .
( On deletion in a hash table with internal chaining , you have to leave a marker that allows you to keep probing past the deletion .
With repeated insertions and deletions , the table might become full of deletion markers and have very poor performance . )
For full compatibility with Judy , two values were chosen as " out of band " , to represent ' empty ' and ' deleted ' slots in the hash table .
The main data structure that keeps data about the hash table contains two boolean flags for whether the corresponding keys are currently in the associative array , and two values representing their associated values if so , so that those keys will never appear in the hash table " legitimately " and are thus safe to use " out of band " .
( Traditionally , hash tables are often hashing pointers and can use NULL pointers or misaligned pointers as out - of - band values . )
I put some effort into trying to " early out " of the hash table routines quickly ; for example , if the first probe is a hit , the secondary hash value is never computed .
The hash table implementation is about 200 lines of C code , and can be read here .
I used Bob Jenkin 's mix function which is designed to intermix three 32 - bit values at a time ; probably overkill for a single 32 - bit value , but it means there 's pretty much no plausible data that does n't hash well .
Testing Environment and Process
I originally compiled Judy under Win2 K with MSVC 6 , but migrated to Win98 for final testing .
I did not attempt to use any of the supplied makefiles or such , and manually constructed compiler directives instead .
In a few cases this required making copies of some files that are compiled twice , because I could n't find any way to convince the MSVC IDE to compile them multiple times otherwise .
After moving to Win98 , I had to change the Judy memory allocator to allocate an additional 16 bytes on every allocation , and leave eight bytes on either side as padding ; presumably this is due to bugs in the Win98 memory allocator .
( I had to do something similar to my hash table allocator , but I never tested that under Win2 K and it might just be a bug in my code . )
The total number of lines of code in " JudyCommon " ( double - counting the two duplicated files described above ) , according to " wc - l *.c " : 23,850
The performance comparison was run on a Dell laptop with a 700 Mhz Pentium III processor .
The machine had 512MB of memory , but exhibited a small amount of disk activity on the largest tests , despite only requiring around 128 MB to store the largest data structure , even after repeated runs to " warm " the machine .
( This odd choice for a test machine is simply because it is my primary home machine .
People are welcome to repeat the tests on other platforms , and I 'll be happy to link to the results . )
A single application included Judy , the hash table implementation , and the test bed .
This application is implemented in a single C file , which should be completely portable except for the single function at the end which reports the current time ( which is here implemented for Win98 only ) .
It does not include the Judy source code , which must be built and linked separately .
The test bed itself runs repeated tests on differing sizes of tables , using various datasets .
The original version ran each test three times and reported the fastest version , to avoid random glitches , but in the end this was removed since the tests were running far too slowly .
It turns out that sufficient sample points are gathered that any glitching will cause a visible outlier in the data which is easily ignored , and in fact it rarely happens in practice on this machine .
DOS batch files were used to generate all the sample data ; they should be able to be converted to shell scripts without much trouble .
( hash.bat , judy.bat , both.bat , build.bat , probe.bat )
( There is a little sloppiness in the results reported below .
This is due to the fact that this data collection process took too long and I had to give up before I was able to get everything perfect . )
Judy is more space efficient than the hash table , but not astonishingly so .
The hash table at its fullest is 65 % full , so uses 8/0.65 bytes per key / value pair , or roughly 12 bytes .
Judy is usually a bit better .
However , immediately after doubling the hash table uses twice as much storage for essentially the same number of keys , so on average and in the worst case Judy is quite a bit smaller .
( This effect will be less significant with larger associated values . )
When looking up data , Judy is slower for very large data structures ( 1M+ entries ) if the data is random , and faster if it is n't .
( This is n't because the hash table is bad at non -random data , but because Judy is good at it . )
For smaller data structures , the hash table is a tad faster .
The hash table is always faster for updating ( insertion and deletion without changing the overall size of the data structure ) .
Time to build a data structure by repeated insertions are similar to lookup - time .
I want to make sure you understand why I use the particular mode of graphing I do , so I 'm going to illustrate some poor choices first .
We 'll use as the example data the time taken to build an associative array of a given size , which is probably the least important data to be presented here .
The x-axis in the above graph is the number of insertions ; the vertical axis is the time taken in milliseconds .
Because the graph is n't logarithmic , it is dominated by the very large data structures ; the first x-axis tic mark is at 2,000,000 items .
Let 's look at a log - log graph instead , to try to preserve detail across the board .
Now we can see all the data points , but because the graph is dominated by the exponential growth of the time ( due to exponential growth in the number of insertions ) , there 's really no way to read the data .
Instead , we use a logarithmic x- axis , and for the y - axis , we switch from total time to " time per operation " ; in this case , milliseconds per insertion during the build phase .
( To make sure this is unambiguous , relative to the first graph above , this graphs y/x [ dependent ] vs. log ( x ) [ independent ] . )
Here you can see the data is much more readable , so this is the format all the graphs will be in .
The y - axis will always extend down to 0 , so something which is twice as high as something else will always mean it is slower by a factor of 2 .
Now let 's interpret the data .
hash seq , hash rand32
In each tooth , the jump upwards represents a point where the table size doubled , and extra time was spent rehashing .
Then the average time per insertion starts dropping again as the insertion happens without triggering rehashes .
You can see that the sawtooth stays roughly level for the left third of the graph , and then rises .
It begins rising at the rehash at around 20 K elements , meaning when the hash table grows from 32 K to 64 K elements .
Each hash table entry requires 8 bytes , so this indicates the table has grown from 256 K to 512K .
This might mean that the secondary cache is only 256 K on this machine .
( There 's another hidden table being used , the table of precomputed keys to insert , which is traversed as the table is built .
This will cause some cache conflicts , but hopefully not too many , especially as it is 4 - bytes per key and traversed linearly with perfect cacheing . )
hash uppercase
The line also behaves erratically below 10000 , but this appears to be due to glitchy data ( a single continuously growing build was used to capture all the samples , so a single glitch affected all samples , but became inconsequential as more time was spent ) .
Also , the total time for under 2000 entries was 1.0 ms , and the output routine only displays one place after the decimal ( despite measuring it much more precisely , oops ) , so the low end data is all rather suspect .
( Note that I did something different for the rest of the performance timings , so this mistake only matters for this graph . )
judy seq
judy seq64
Both seq and seq64 do not start at 0 ; they start at some arbitrarily large number I 've forgotten that has non -zero values in every byte .
I also tested some other seq amounts , but they all behaved similarly .
Seq64 is probably not the best choice , since it will result in Judy leaves of exactly 4 elements , which happens by chance to be stored in one 32 - byte cache line .

Hit Times
Overall , hash table performance is strictly superior to Judy for under 10,000 items .
Beyond that , hash table performance slows ( as mentioned before , presumably due to secondary cacheing effects ) .
Judy on sequential data maintains the same performance regardless of size , and is superior beyond 20,000 entries ( on this machine , and tuning the hash table might change this crossover point ) .
However , the hash table is strictly superior on all the random data presented here , generally by a factor of 2 .
rand8888 is random 32 - bit numbers .
rand0688 is random 22 - bit numbers .
rand5678 is random numbers where the high byte has 5 random bits , and the low byte has 8 random bits , for a total of 22 random bits .
rand8765 is similar , but byte - swapped .
Note that the judy uppercase ends in a tail ; the extra points correspond to number of insertions that would fall further to the right , but the data points are marked based on the actual number of entries in the table .
As Judy goes from nearly - full ( of random data ) to full , its performance increases slightly ( but does not come anywhere close to the sequential result ) .
As might be expected from the nature of Judy , rand8765 has the worst performance .
I spent a lot of time trying to find a dataset on which Judy would behave better than on the random data , but worse than the sequence data .
This included building the table with sequential data that had been shuffled , or using sequential - by - some - 4 - digit - prime , or using a " jittered " sequence ; while this code is in the codebase , I did get around to graphing any of it and I 'm not sure where that middleground lies .
Clearly rand8765 is effectively just constructed to be a worst - case for Judy , and probably is n't likely to ever occur in real life .
Curiously , judy seq64 is consistently faster than judy seq in the 2,000 - 10,000 region , but they are reversed above 50,000 .
Miss Times
We can make a simple prediction of what we'd expect this graph to look like compared to the hit graph , based on the way the algorithms work .
Judy uses a tree in which any key has exactly one place it might exist , whether it 's present or not ; the time to find a key should be the same , whether a hit or a miss .
The hash table uses a chain of entries threaded through the table of all items with the same hash key , and does what is effectively a linear probe of those .
A miss requires searching the whole list ; a hit will on average require searching half the list , so we expect miss times for the hash table to be about twice the hit times .
This is roughly born out in the actual data .
In practice , though , with the hash table as sparse as it is , miss times are not actually twice as slow , but more like 1.3 to 1.6 the speed .
As a result , the hash table miss times are still competitive with Judy below 10,000 entries , and similar to Judy for random numbers all the way up the scale .
Judy gets a big lead for the step - by - 64 arithmetic sequence .
In the special case of the increment - by - 1 - sequence , there are n't any values you can probe that lie between two values present in the table ; anything that misses must be smaller than or larger than every other entry in the table .
As a result , judy seq misses always probe off either the left or right end of the table , and as a result , it should end up with all the necessary data in the primary cache .
You can see this in the results for judy seq from 30,000 to 7,000,000 ; the last data point might be a glitch .
I do n't know why it 's not faster below 20,000 .
Insertion & Deletion Times
The following graph is a closeup of the left half of the above graph .
Optimized insertions and deletions were apparently not a focus of Judy ; the hash table is fairly efficient .
( Insertions correspond to misses , and deletions to hits , but this graph does n't look like the average of those two , so more is going on . )
The hash table rehash logic is unlikely to be triggered here ( except for the rehash - if - too - many - deletes ) due to the intentional mismatch of the doubling and halving threshhold .
( Perhaps the too - many - deletes is being triggered , and this accounts for the spikiness of the graph in the hundreds - of - thousands ; I do n't know . )
But as I showed in the first graph , the hash table does perform competitively on raw - insertions , even with the cost of rehashing on doubling .
So in general insertion & deletion are a win for the hash table .
Data Structure Size
Judy is way smaller than the hash table .
In the best case , with sequential data , Judy uses about 5 bytes - - 4 of which are required to store the value , so effectively only 1 byte per key .
That grows rapidly to 7 bytes for seq64 .
( The curves which drop down at the right do n't count -- this is again a case of graphing memory vs. number of insertions instead of memory vs. total number of entries . )
Meanwhile the hash table best case uses the worst case memory of Judy ( around 12 bytes ) , and worst case uses 24 .
As illustrated in this data , Judy 's smaller size does not give it an enormous speed advantage over a traditional " trade size for speed " data structure .
Judy has received countless man-hours developing and debugging 20,000 lines of code ; I spent an hour or three writing a fairly standard 200 - line hash table .
If your data is strictly sequential ; you should use a regular array .
If your data is often sequential , or approximately sequential ( e.g. an arithmetic sequence stepping by 64 ) , Judy might be the best data structure to use .
If you need to keep space to a minimum -- you have a huge number of associative arrays , or you 're only storing very small values , Judy is probably a good idea .
If you need an sorted iterator , go with Judy .
Otherwise , a hash table may be just as effective , possibly faster , and much simpler .
Furthermore , there are n't many ways to improve Judy , but there 's a lot of room to improve hash tables .
The one tested here is just my standard " classic " hash table .
I do n't know what best practice really is these days .
For example , Knuth describes numerous strategies for hashing to allow the table to be more full .
Using a prime table size would allow rehashing to grow by , say , 25 % instead of 100 % , reducing storage overhead .
There 's already a strategy for incrementally growing a hash table a single slot at a time , explictly amortizing what is effectively size - doubling .
( Although this is kind of silly since you do n't want to realloc ( ) the data structure one item at a time , to avoid O ( N2 ) cost .
In fact , realloc ( ) may automatically use doubling under the hood -- in which case you might as well expose the memory to the hash table . )
Alternately , we can reconsider hash tables on the basis of cache usage .
For example , in the testbed source code is a second hash table implementation : a bucketed hash .
This is a hash table in which every 32 - byte cache line is a bucket of four key / value pairs ; this allows the equivalent of four probes with only one cache line load .
My experiments showed this slightly improved miss times , but made little other difference ; however , more tuning of the doubling threshhold might have made more difference ( it might be wise to then let the table get more full ) .
One could also Judy - ize hash tables -- allowing null pointers to represent empty tables , and storing very small tables ( under 16 entries , say ) , specially , possibly using the bottom bits to tag the special cases .
You could probably do pretty well using only another 100 lines of code .
Of course , you can certainly take the attitude that Judy performs well enough , and the fact that it 's 20,000 lines of code does n't really matter , as long as those lines of code work and you never have to look at them -- and it appears Judy is mature enough that this is the case .
It bugs me , though .

* This is building on from last time .
In particular , that means that all the same disclaimers apply .
Having done " wc - c " as the previous benchmark , the next thing to look at is " wc - l " - line counting .
A line is defined as being a sequence of non-newline characters , optionally ending with a newline .
This means that " test " has 1 line , " test
" has 1 line , " test
test " has 2 lines .
Its trivial to express this in Haskell : The Haskell code uses the sameas before , but the C code needed more changes :
The C code is quite hard to write .
In fact , this code is the original version I wrote - with an accidental mistake .
Rest assured that I benchmarked with the correct code , but see if you can spot the mistake .
As in the previous example , I 've demanded that all implementations useat their heart , to make everything a fair comparison .
The benchmark was then line counting on the same 35 Mb file as previously :
And the numbers : C=4.969 , Supero=5.063 , GHC=9.533 .
This time the difference between C and Supero is a mere 2 % .
However the difference between Supero and GHC has grown considerably !
The reason for this is an advanced optimisation that has managed to removethe intermediate lists .
In a normal Haskell program , would build a list of characters , would take that list , and build a list of strings , thenwould take that list and consume it .
With my optimisation , no intermediate lists are created at all .
While in the previous benchmark it was easy to examine and understand the generated GHC Core , for this one it is much harder .
The benchmark has ended up using a recursive group of functions , none of which use unboxed numbers .
For this reason , I suspect that the benchmark could be improved further for Supero .
Once again , credit needs to be given to GHC for the results - it is clearly doing some clever things .
This benchmark is slightly more interesting than the previous one , but is still a bit of a micro - benchmark - not following a real program .
My next task is to probably move on to " wc - w " to complete then set , then a real benchmark suite such as nobench .
I hope that this demonstrates that Haskell can be beautiful , pure , and match C for speed in some cases .
All People in Canada are the Same Age
Statement S(n ) :
In any group of n people , everyone in that group has the same age .
If you 're a little shaky on the principle of induction ( which this proof uses ) , there 's a brief summary of it below .
The Fallacious Proof of Statement S(n ) :
Step 1 : In any group that consists of just one person , everybody in the group has the same age , because after all there is only one person !
Step 2 : Therefore , statement S ( 1 ) is true .
( 1 ) is true .
Step 3 : The next stage in the induction argument is to prove that , whenever S ( n ) is true for one number ( say n = k ) , it is also true for the next number ( that is , n = k +1 ) .
( ) is true for one number ( say = ) , it is also true for the next number ( that is , = +1 ) .
Step 4 : We can do this by ( 1 ) assuming that , in every group of k people , everyone has the same age ; then ( 2 ) deducing from it that , in every group of k + 1 people , everyone has the same age .
people , everyone has the same age ; then ( 2 ) deducing from it that , in every group of +1 people , everyone has the same age .
Step 5 : Let G be an arbitrary group of k + 1 people ; we just need to show that every member of G has the same age .
be an arbitrary group of +1 people ; we just need to show that every member of has the same age .
Step 6 : To do this , we just need to show that , if P and Q are any members of G , then they have the same age .
and are any members of , then they have the same age .
Step 7 : Consider everybody in G except P .
These people form a group of k people , so they must all have the same age ( since we are assuming that , in any group of k people , everyone has the same age ) .
except .
These people form a group of people , so they must all have the same age ( since we are assuming that , in any group of people , everyone has the same age ) .
Step 8 : Consider everybody in G except Q .
Again , they form a group of k people , so they must all have the same age .
except .
Again , they form a group of people , so they must all have the same age .
Step 9 : Let R be someone else in G other than P or Q .
be someone else in other than or .
Step 10 : Since Q and R each belong to the group considered in step 7 , they are the same age .
and each belong to the group considered in step 7 , they are the same age .
Step 11 : Since P and R each belong to the group considered in step 8 , they are the same age .
and each belong to the group considered in step 8 , they are the same age .
Step 12 : Since Q and R are the same age , and P and R are the same age , it follows that P and Q are the same age .
and are the same age , and and are the same age , it follows that and are the same age .
Step 13 : We have now seen that , if we consider any two people P and Q in G , they have the same age .
It follows that everyone in G has the same age .
and in , they have the same age .
It follows that everyone in has the same age .
Step 14 : The proof is now complete : we have shown that the statement is true for n=1 , and we have shown that whenever it is true for n=k it is also true for n=k +1 , so by induction it is true for all n .
See if you can figure out in which step the fallacy lies .
When you think you 've figured it out , click on that step and the computer will tell you whether you are correct or not , and will give an additional explanation of why that step is or is n't valid .
See how many tries it takes you to correctly identify the fallacious step !
A Brief Review of the Principle of Induction
To state it more informally : suppose you have the number 1 in your collection , and for each number that you have in the collection , you also have it plus 1 in your collection .
Then you have all the natural numbers .
Intuitively , the idea is that if you start with the number 1 , and keep on adding 1 to it , you will eventually get to every number .
The principle of induction is extremely important because it allows one to prove many results that are much more difficult to prove in other ways .
The most common application is when one has a statement one wants to prove about each natural number .
It may be quite difficult to prove the statement directly , but easy to derive the truth of the statement about n+1 from the truth of the statement about n .
In that case , one appeals to the principle of induction by showing
The statement is true when n=1 .
Whenever the statement is true for one number n , then it 's also true for the next number n+1 .
As an example , consider proving that 1+2+3+· · ·+n = n( n+1 ) / 2 .
To try to prove that equality for a general , unspecified n just by algebraic manipulations is very difficult .
But it 's easy to prove by induction , because it 's true when n=1 ( 1 = 1 ( 1+1 ) / 2 ) , and whenever it 's true for one number n , that means 1+2+3+ · · ·+n = n( n+1 ) / 2 , so 1+2+3+· · ·+n+( n+1 ) = n( n+1 ) /2 + ( n+1 ) = ( n+1 ) ( n+ 2 ) / 2 , so it 's also true for n+1 .
These two facts , combined with the principle of induction , mean that it 's true for all n .

Republican Congressman says housing deal ' pretty much ' legal
Michael Roston
Published : Friday May 11 , 2007 Print This Email This
A Republican Congressman from Ohio described a curious deal to buy and build a house in his home state as ' pretty much aboveboard ' when quizzed about the arrangement by the Toledo Blade on May 4 .
Rep. Paul Gillmor ( R - OH ) , now in his tenth term , bought a $ 1 million house on a golf course near his district .
The house was bought and built by a trust that is managed by a law firm called Vorys , Sater , Seymour and Pease , which has donated $ 6,500 to Mr. Gillmors campaigns since 1997 .
When contacted about the curious ownership arrangement by Toledo Blade reporter Joshua Boak , Gillmore apparently called " the arrangement behind his new house ' pretty much above - board . ' "
An editorial in the paper suggested that the Ohio Republican had a guilty conscience .
" We think we detected a Freudian slip on the part of U.S. Rep .
Paul Gillmor as he explained why he bought a million - dollar home ... and tried to hide the transaction behind a subsidiary of a politically friendly Columbus law firm , " the paper noted .
The editorial also assailed the fact that the mansion is not located in the district he represents in Congress .
" In that context , his attitude suggests that of a royalist French duke who prefers Paris : ' Ill be happy to serve the 5th District , just dont expect me to live among the serfs , ' " the Blade opined .
While Gillmor 's staff initially told Boak that the house was purchased for his family , he later said any properties he owns outside his district are " only real estate investments . "
Boak 's article can be read at this link .
His paper 's editorial is available at this link .
Note :
The story about Gillmor 's house was noted in this morning 's " In The Loop " column at the Washington Post .
Jesus Christ did n't need fancy churches , but thank goodness that some people did n't listen too well and built magnificent buildings to glorify God .
Today , there are thousands of churches : some small and simple , whereas others are humongous and ornately decorated .
Let 's take a look at some divinely designed churches around the world , both classic and modern in style :
Las Lajas Cathedral

The Sanctuary of Our Lady of Las Lajas , or the Las Lajas Cathedral [ wiki ] in Colombia , was built in 1916 on a site where , according to local legend , the Virgin Mary appeared .
The story goes like this : an Indian woman named María Mueses de Quiñones was carrying her deaf - mute daughter Rosa on her back near Las Lajas ( " The Rocks " ) .
Weary of the climb , the María sat down on a rock when Rosa spoke ( for the first time ) about an apparition in a cave .
Later on , a mysterious painting of the Virgin Mary carrying a baby was discovered on the wall of the cave .
Supposedly , studies of the painting showed no proof of paint or pigments on the rock - instead , when a core sample was taken , it was found that the colors were impregnated in the rock itself to a depth of several feet .
Whether true or not , the legend spurred the building of a gothic church worthy of a fairy tale .

La Sagrada Familia [ official site | wiki ] , or Catalan for " The Holy Family " , is a yet - to - be- finished Roman Catholic basilica in Barcelona , Spain .
The church 's design is rich with Christian symbolism , with façades featuring intricate details describing the birth , life , death , and resurrection of Jesus Christ .
Perhaps the most awe inspiring is the eighteen towers representing the 12 Apostles , 4 Evangelists , the Virgin Mary , and a central tower - the tallest of them all - representing Christ .
The construction of the Sagrada Familia basilica started in 1882 , directed by Catalan architect Antoni Gaudí , who devoted his life to it .
When people said that the construction had taken a very long time , Gaudí replied that he was building the church for God , and that his client was n't in a hurry .
He then became known as " God 's Architect . "
In 1926 , Gaudí got run over by a street car .
Because of his raggedy attire and empty pockets , no one wanted to take him to the hospital .
Eventually , he was taken to a pauper 's hospital where no one recognized him until his friends found him and tried to move him to another hospital .
Gaudí refused , saying that he belonged with the poor , and died a few days later .
Because Gaudí refused to work with blue prints , preferring to use his imagination and memory instead , construction of La Sagrada Familia was halted after his death .
Part of the church was even burnt during the Spanish Civil War.
Construction of La Sagrada Familia was restarted afterwards and continues until today .
St. Basil 's Cathedral

As its name implies , St. Basil 's Cathedral [ wiki ] on the Red Square in Moscow , Russia , is named after Saint Basil ( who is also known as Basil Fool for Christ ) .
The story goes that in the 1500s , an apprentice shoemaker / serf named Basil stole from the rich to give to the poor .
He also went naked , weighed himself with chains , and rebuked Ivan the Terrible for not paying attention in church .
Most of the time , admonishing anyone with name " the Terrible " was n't such a good idea , but apparently Ivan had a soft spot for the holy fool ( as Basil was also known ) and ordered a church to be built in his name after Basil died .
St. Basil 's Cathedral , a Russian Orthodox church , sports a series of colorful bulbous domes that taper to a point , aptly named onion domes , that are part of Moscow 's Kremlin skyline ( although the church is actually not part of the Kremlin ) .
Oh , and Ivan the Terrible lived up to his name after he supposedly blinded the architect who built the church so he would not be able to design something as beautiful afterwards .
Hagia Sophia

Technically , Hagia Sophia [ wiki ] ( Greek for the Church of the Holy Wisdom of God ) is no longer a church , it is now a museum in Istanbul , Turkey .
It began its life as an early Christian church , then rebuilt as the seat of the Eastern Orthodox Church in Constantinople , then a mosque when the city fell to the Turks in 1453 before it finally became a museum .
Hagia Sophia as we know it today was completed by Byzantine Emperor Justinian I in 537 .
When completed , the temple was so large and richly decorated that Justinian proclaimed " Solomon , I have surpassed thee ! " .
It remained the largest church for one thousand years after it was completed .
Hagia Sophia is one of the greatest surviving examples of Byzantine architecture , with a large central dome and interior intricately decorated with mosaics , marbles , and stone inlays .
The dome , often referred to as the vault of heaven , was a new architectural feature at the time , necessitating the invention of a new pillar support system .
Today , the restoration of Hagia Sophia is a delicate balance of restoring Christian iconographic mosaics under historic Islamic art , which would have to be destroyed to reveal the work underneath .
St. Peter 's Basilica

The largest religious building in the world , not to mention the center of Christianity , I suppose , belongs in this list .
St. Peter 's Basilica in Vatican City is built over the tomb of St. Peter the Apostle , and is the largest church in the tiny country .
It is truly immense : the church covers an area of 5.7 acres ( 2.3 ha ) and has a capacity of over 60,000 people .
Before St. Peter 's Basilica as we know it was built , there was already a church there built in 324 C.E. by Emperor Constantine , the first Christian emperor of Rome .
That church lasted for about 1,200 years until the crumbling structure was torn down to build the modern - day basilica .
St. Peter 's Basilica was built by the who's who of the Renaissance era : Michelangelo designed the dome , Gian Lorenzo Bernini designed the main square , and Donato Bramante was the first architect of the church .

Notre Dame de Paris [ wiki ] or simply Notre Dame is the quintessential example of Gothic Architecture .
Construction of the church started in 1163 , when Bishop Maurice de Sully decided to build a cathedral befitting his status as the bishop of Paris .
Notre Dame was completed some 200 years later - one of the first European cathedrals to be built on a truly monumental scale .
A particularly striking feature of Notre Dame are its Rose Windows - massive ( at the time they were the largest windows in the world ) circular stained glass windows that depict scenes from the bible .
Legend has it that when Notre Dame 's bell " Emmanuel " was recast in the 1600s , women threw their gold jewelry into the molten metal to give the bell its unique ring .
At the end of the 18th century , during the French Revolution , the church was ransacked , its treasures plundered and many of the statues of saints were beheaded .
Notre Dame was dedicated to the Cult of Reason and then the Cult of the Supreme Being - for a while , it was even used as a barn !
In 1831 , Notre Dame was made famous by Victor Hugo , who wrote " The Hunchback of Notre Dame , " about Quasimodo , a hunchback bell ringer who fell in love with the Gypsy Esmeralda .
The popularity of the book spurred a gothic revival in France and helped the restoration of the cathedral back to its original splendor .
Hallgrímskirkja
Hallgrímskirkja ( Image Credit : Andreas Tille [ wiki ] )
Hallgrímskirkja [ wiki ] ( Icelandic for the Church of Hallgrímur ) , the tallest building in Iceland , is named after Hallgrímur Pétursson , a 17th century poet and clergyman .
The church 's unusual design ( some had likened it to a rude hand gesture ) is supposed to represent volcanic columns rising between the steeple tower - a reference to Iceland 's many volcanoes .
The iconic building looks like it belongs in J.R.R. Tolkien 's Lord of the Rings .
Indeed , many aspects of Tolkien 's work was inspired by Norse mythologies and many of the fictional names in the book are Norse in origin , although there is no reference that Hallgrímskirkja served as a model any of the towers in the book .
Jubilee Church

You can't miss the distinctive curved walls of The Jubilee Church [ wiki ] in Tor Tre Teste , Rome .
It was designed in 1996 by architect Richard Meier , who said that the modern - styled church is the " the crown jewel of the Vicariato di Roma 's ( Archdiocese of Rome ) Millennium project . "
And right he was !
The curved walls not only serve the engineering purpose of minimizing thermal peak loads in the interior space , they are also a religious methapor :
Three circles of equal radius generate the profiles of the three shells that , together with the spine - wall , make up the body of the nave .
While the three shells discretely imply the Holy Trinity , the reflecting pool symbolizes water in the ritual of Baptism .
Notre Dame du Haut

If there was a church modeled after Elvis ' hair , Le Corbusier 's Notre Dame du Haut is it .
The pilgrimate chapel is located in Ronchamp , France .
Indeed , it is more famous than the little town that most people simply call the structure itself Ronchamp .
The cleverness of unusual design of the billowing concrete roof is apparent when it rains : water pours off the slanted roof onto a fountain , creating a dramatic waterfall .
Although quite different from his usual design , Notre Dame du Haut is considered one of Le Corbusier 's finest work .
The Crystal Cathedral

The Crystal Cathedral [ official site | wiki ] is neither made of crystal nor is it a cathedral .
Nevertheless , the Christian megachurch in the city of Orange Garden Grove , California , is one amazing church .
Built by " The Hour of Power " televangelist Rev. Dr. Robert H. Schuller ( who started out with a " drive - in " church located in an actual , old drive - in movie theater ! ) and his wife Arvella , and designed by architect Philip Johnson , the church is made almost entirely out glass with a web - like framework of steel .
From the outside , the Crystal Cathedral is shaped like a giant four - pointed crystal star , with the main " cathedral " rising 12 stories above the ground , featuring a mirror - like exterior composed of some 12,000 panes of glass .
The view is even more amazing from the interior , where the transparent glass lets in the surrounding view , sunlight and the sky .
The Crystal Cathedral also has one of the largest pipe organs in the world , called the Hazel Wright Pipe Organ , with 5 consoles controlling 270 ranks , 31 digital ranks , and more than 16,000 pipes !
Bonus : Darth Vader Grotesque
Waaaay up near the top of the tower of the Washington National Cathedral , there is a carved grotesque ( a structural element to deflect rainwater from the building , similar to a gargoyle ) shaped like ... Darth Vader !
How did the Star Wars villain get there ?
Turns out in the 1980s , the Cathedral sponsored a sculpture design competition for children .
Four winning designs were chosen : a raccoon , a girl with pigtails and braces , a man with large teeth and an umbrella , and lastly , Darth Vader .
If you must know , the Darth sculpture was proposed by Christopher Rader of Kearney , Nebraska .
Bonus : The Abston Church of Christ
Amy Hughes ' LEGO Church
Computer programmer Amy Hughes built a fantastically detailed 7 feet by 5 1 / 2 feet by 30 inches miniature church out of LEGO , called the Abston Church of Christ .
Why Abston ?
That 's because LEGO is made out of Acrylonitrile Butadiene Styrene ( ABS ) .
It took her over a year to build the church .
Bonus : The Dog Chapel
Stephen Huneck 's Dog Chapel , complete with statue of a man walking his dog
After his dogs ( and loving wife ! ) helped him recover from a serious illness that doctors thought would kill him , artist Stephen Huneck decided to build a chapel in honor man 's best friend .
Huneck built the dog chapel on his mountain - top farm in St. Johnsbury , Vermont .
Inside , there are four pews with dog sculptures , a fantastic dog stained - glass window and other interesting dog - themed arts .
Let me be the first to acknowledge that this list is far from complete .

Chapter 1 . Refactoring , a First ExampleHow do I begin to write about refactoring ?
The traditional way to begin talking about something is to outline the history , broad principles , and the like .
When someone does that at a conference , I get slightly sleepy .
My mind starts wandering with a low - priority background process that polls the speaker until he or she gives an example .
The examples wake me up because it is with examples that I can see what is going on .
With principles it is too easy to make generalizations , too hard to figure out how to apply things .
An example helps make things clear .
So I 'm going to start this book with an example of refactoring .
During the process I 'll tell you a lot about how refactoring works and give you a sense of the process of refactoring .
I can then provide the usual principles - style introduction .
With an introductory example , however , I run into a big problem .
If I pick a large program , describing it and how it is refactored is too complicated for any reader to work through .
( I tried and even a slightly complicated example runs to more than a hundred pages . )
However , if I pick a program that is small enough to be comprehensible , refactoring does not look like it is worthwhile .
Thus I 'm in the classic bind of anyone who wants to describe techniques that are useful for real - world programs .
Frankly it is not worth the effort to do the refactoring that I 'm going to show you on a small program like the one I 'm going to use .
But if the code I 'm showing you is part of a larger system , then the refactoring soon becomes important .
So I have to ask you to look at this and imagine it in the context of a much larger system .
The Starting PointThe sample program is very simple .
It is a program to calculate and print a statement of a customer 's charges at a video store .
The program is told which movies a customer rented and for how long .
It then calculates the charges , which depend on how long the movie is rented , and identifies the type movie .
There are three kinds of movies : regular , children's , and new releases .
In addition to calculating charges , the statement also computes frequent renter points , which vary depending on whether the film is a new release .
Several classes represent various video elements .
Here 's a class diagram to show them ( Figure 1.1 ) .
I 'll show the code for each of these classes in turn .
MovieMovie is just a simple data class .
Figure 1.1 .
Class diagram of the starting - point classes .
Only the most important features are shown .
The notation is Unified Modeling Language UML [ Fowler , UML ] .
Rental
The rental class represents a customer renting a movie .
Customer
The customer class represents the customer of the store .
Like the other classes it has data and accessors : Customer also has the method that produces a statement .
Figure 1.2 shows the interactions for this method .
The body for this method is on the facing page .
Figure 1.2 .
Interactions for the statement methodComments on the Starting ProgramWhat are your impressions about the design of this program ?
I would describe it as not well designed and certainly not object oriented .
For a simple program like this , that does not really matter .
There 's nothing wrong with a quick and dirty simple program .
But if this is a representative fragment of a more complex system , then I have some real problems with this program .
That long statement routine in the Customer class does far too much .
Many of the things that it does should really be done by the other classes .
Even so the program works .
Is this not just an aesthetic judgment , a dislike of ugly code ?
It is until we want to change the system .
The compiler does n't care whether the code is ugly or clean .
But when we change the system , there is a human involved , and humans do care .
A poorly designed system is hard to change .
Hard because it is hard to figure out where the changes are needed .
If it is hard to figure out what to change , there is a strong chance that the programmer will make a mistake and introduce bugs .
In this case we have a change that the users would like to make .
First they want a statement printed in HTML so that the statement can be Web enabled and fully buzzword compliant .
Consider the impact this change would have .
As you look at the code you can see that it is impossible to reuse any of the behavior of the current statement method for an HTML statement .
Your only recourse is to write a whole new method that duplicates much of the behavior of statement .
Now , of course , this is not too onerous .
You can just copy the statement method and make whatever changes you need .
But what happens when the charging rules change ?
You have to fix both statement and html_statement and ensure the fixes are consistent .
The problem with copying and pasting code comes when you have to change it later .
If you are writing a program that you do n't expect to change , then cut and paste is fine .
If the program is long lived and likely to change , then cut and paste is a menace .
This brings me to a second change .
The users want to make changes to the way they classify movies , but they have n't yet decided on the change they are going to make .
They have a number of changes in mind .
These changes will affect both the way renters are charged for movies and the way that frequent renter points are calculated .
As an experienced developer you are sure that whatever scheme users come up with , the only guarantee you 're going to have is that they will change it again within six months .
The statement method is where the changes have to be made to deal with changes in classification and charging rules .
If , however , we copy the statement to an HTML statement , we need to ensure that any changes are completely consistent .
Furthermore , as the rules grow in complexity it 's going to be harder to figure out where to make the changes and harder to make them without making a mistake .
You may be tempted to make the fewest possible changes to the program ; after all , it works fine .
Remember the old engineering adage : " if it ai n't broke , do n't fix it . "
The program may not be broken , but it does hurt .
It is making your life more difficult because you find it hard to make the changes your users want .
This is where refactoring comes in .
TipWhen you find you have to add a feature to a program , and the program 's code is not structured in a convenient way to add the feature , first refactor the program to make it easy to add the feature , then add the feature .
Francis Bartels has a story to tell .
Of his experience as a black man in Hitler 's Germany and of his memories of his pupil Kofi Annan , who would become the world 's top diplomat .
Bartels has written his memoirs but , at 96 , knows time is not on his side to get it published , writes David Smith .
So the great - great - grandfather turned to a website which is quietly changing the face of the publishing industry .
Lulu.com offers the chance to upload writing on the internet for sale on demand .
The site is now selling 2,000 different titles a week and will produce about a million units this year , making it one of the world 's biggest publishers .
It costs budding authors nothing to put their book on Lulu , although they must format and edit it themselves .
Money is paid only when anyone orders a copy .
Some are printed only once , some never .
Bartels , a former Unesco education adviser , said : ' I 've written books before and I know it takes two years from submitting the manuscript to the time it 's out . '
In the Fifties Bartels was head of Mfantsipim School , Cape Coast , Ghana , and remembers Annan , now UN Secretary - General .
' He was a good student with a mind of his own , ' he said .
' He was the Jesse Owens of the school , good on the playing field as well as in class . '
Bartels , who now lives in Paris , could not spice up his book with tales of Annan getting into trouble .
' I can't remember ever caning him .
I reserved caning for anti-social behaviour only .
Maybe I did .
Only he will remember . '
He is glad Annan 's tenure at the UN is almost over .
' I 'm relieved that he 's leaving that burden , which he described to me as ' The job from hell " . '

This direct - to - DVD movie was the 1st of 4 to be released after the tv series was cancelled at the end of season 5 .
When the series was to be revived on a different network , this movie was split into 4 parts , each part equal to the usual length of a tv episode , and shown first as season 6 episodes 1 through 4 .
The other 3 movies were also similarly split and formed the remainder of season 6 , 16 episodes in all .
Finally , the new episodes made specifically for tv followed as season 7 .
This practice was identically used for later tv syndication and streaming services such as Hulu .

For reasons we are still trying to figure out what was supposed to be a well planned attempt to clean up a few journals that were violating LiveJournal 's policies that protect minors turned into a total mess .
I can only say I ’m sorry , explain what we did wrong and what we are doing to correct these problems and explain what we were trying to do but messed up so completely .
What we did wrong ;
1 ) Over the last couple of days we have suspended ( not deleted ) about 500 journals out of many millions on LJ .
2 ) It is now clear that in an unfortunate number of cases these journals were suspended for easily correctable problems in their profiles that would then allow them to be reinstated and that this was not communicated to the journal or community owners at all .
3 ) Further , because of miscommunication these journals were taken down before review could be completed to avoid mistakes .
How we are fixing it .
1 ) Over the next few hours we will review the journals that were taken down and wherever appropriate we will restore these journals or communities before 12 noon PDT .
Sorry it will take that long but we do not want to reinstate true and clear violators of community policy .
2 ) In some cases Journals that were restored will be asked to clarify their profiles to avoid the appearance that they are soliciting or encouraging illegal activities .
3 ) Journals that we do not restore will be journals that we are fairly sure are actually intended to encourage activities that put minors at risk but we will review them if requested by their owner to be certain that we did not make a mistake .
4 ) In cases that we ask owners to clarify their profiles and they fail to do so within 7 days we will suspend their journals again .
So what were we trying to do when we messed up so badly ?
As most of you know , LJ has a zero tolerance policy toward content that supports child abuse , pedophilia , or sexual violence .
In implementation of this zero tolerance policy there were two issues that made it hard to apply these policies consistently ;
Issue one was profiles .
There were a number of profiles that expressed “ interest ” in activities that most of us would agree put children at risk , notably pedophilia and child rape .
Both in the instructions for profiles and in other places on the site we make it clear that interests listed should be evaluated within the context of “ I like x ” , “ I ’m in favor of x ” or “ I support x ” .
As many profiles are the only public part of a private journal and profiles serve partly as an advertisement for people of like interests , it is important that the content of a profile can be evaluated as if it stands alone .
If your profile were to express interest in pedophilia with no other content that describes this interest as in helping survivors or protecting children from it we must read the profile as “ I like or I support or I ’m in favor of it . ”
For this reason we suspended profiles that meet this criteria .
Another issue we needed to deal with was journals that used a thin veneer of fictional or academic interest in events and storylines that include child rape , pedophilia , and similar themes in order to actually promote these activities .
While there are stories , essays , and discussions that include discussion of these issues in an effort to understand and prevent them , others use a pretext to promote these activities .
It ’s often very hard to tell the difference .
As such , we intended to have suspend reported journals that do not clearly and substantially object to these a reasonable person would think supported these activities .
while at the same time portraying them .
We recently received a complaint from outside the community about a number of journals .
When we receive such complaints it is our obligation to look into them but it is our standards not theirs that we use to make decisions about the complaints .
The source of this complaint was not the source of the problem we created .
We never intended this policy to cause the removal of journals that were have perfectly valid discussions about literature , law or culture .
We never intended the policies to take down journals or communities clearly opposed to illegal activities but clearly we did .
We love our members of fandom and respect their role in our community .
We made a mistake and now we are going to try to fix it .
That is it .
We have always been strong supporters of free speech and at the same time we believe deeply that children deserve special protections as well as the victims of violence and hate .
We tried to implement a policy that walk that line and we did it poorly , we are all sorry .
One could say that no matter what we did we would either be accused of opposing free speech or endangering children but I am sure we should and could have done this much better .
I hope you can forgive us and we can regain your trust .

With the deaths of my enemies I prepare my being for the sacred fight and join the triumphant proletariat with a bestial howl ! ”
The term “ hatred ” was a constant in his writings : “ Hatred as an element of struggle ” ; “ hatred that is intransigent ; ” “ hatred so violent that it propels a human being beyond his natural limitations , making him violent and cold - blooded killing machine . ”
His deranged fantasies included a continental reign of Stalinism .
To achieve this ideal the troubled youth craved , “ millions of atomic victims . ”
The troubled young Argentine was aloof and contemptuous towards everyone around him : “ I have no home , no woman , no father , no mother , no brothers .
My friends are friends only when they think as I do ideologically . ”
Fortunately for the troubled young Argentine , while a vagabond in Mexico City , he had the good fortune to meet an exceedingly shrewd judge of the human psyche .
This judge , a Cuban exile , properly diagnosed the Argentine ’s psychosis and made an “ intervention ” in the nick of time , channeling the troubled youth ’s talents and yearnings toward ends considered constructive by the worldwide intelligentsia : establishing Stalinism .
Shortly the Argentine found himself gainfully employed in Cuba .
His raging bloodlust was amply indulged in the extermination of anti-communist Cubans , a species of mammal that enlightened opinion worldwide considers an insufferable pest .
At first the troubled young Argentine took an active role in the mass murder of defenseless Cubans , shattering the skulls of the convulsed victims with a blast from his own pistol .
But given the volume of these murders the task proved fatiguing and the Argentine soon appointed Cuban henchmen to better facilitate the serial bloodbath .
Not that he distanced himself from the slaughter .
In fact , he took such a keen delight in the murder process that a special window was constructed in his office allowing him to watch and gloat at the orgy of bloodletting in the field below his office .
In this process the Argentine was helping his Cuban mentor establish a personal fiefdom that would prove quite enduring , to put it mildly .
Alas , the ( live ) Argentine ’s usefulness to his mentor would prove nowhere near as enduring and soon his “ martyrdom ” was skillfully arranged .
No sane person would wear a Che T - shirt .
No decent person would tolerate one in his surroundings .
But Che ’s Guevara ’s image is considered the most reproduced image of the century , gracing everything from T - shirts to posters , from thong undies to skateboards , from cellphones to infant “ onezies . ”
Hollywood hails him in blockbuster movies and Time magazine celebrates him among the “ heroes and icons ” of the century , alongside Mother Theresa .
Any serious analyst of Che ’s “ guerrilla ” campaigns cannot escape the conclusion that Ernesto Guevara was actually incapable of applying a compass reading to a map .
Yet seemingly sane historians place him alongside Mao Tse Tung of ( the 8 thousand mile ) “ long march ” fame .
In scope , range and duration the Che Guevara farce far surpasses any other in modern history .
In comparison , The South Sea Bubble was a chump operation .
Only the modern era ’s master huckster and media manipulator — with the eager aid of his ever - faithful accomplices in the Western media , academia , publishing and filmmaking — could have created a masterful guerrilla warrior and secular saint out of this sadist , coward , and epic idiot .
Fidel Castro ’s influence over the Western " intelligentsia ” can only be described as magical , and renders any public evaluation of his regime among the smart set completely devoid of logic .
To wit :
He jailed and tortured at a rate higher than Stalin and refuses ( unlike Apartheid South Africa , Pinochet ’s Chile and Somoza ’s Nicaragua ) to allow Amnesty International or the Red Cross to inspect his prisons .
Yet Cuba sat on the U.N. ’s Human Rights Committee and upon visiting New York as the U.N. ’s keynote speaker in 1995 , Newsweek magazine hailed Castro as “ The Hottest Ticket in Manhattan ! ” and Time as “ The Toast of Manhattan ! ” referring to the social swirl that engulfed him and the autograph hounds who mobbed him from among New York ’s smart set .
His legal code mandates 2 years in prison for anyone overheard cracking a joke about him .
Yet Jack Nicholson and Chevy Chase sing his praises .
He abolished Habeas corpus while his chief hangman ( Che Guevara himself ) declared that “ judicial evidence is an archaic bourgeois detail . ”
Yet Harvard Law School invited him as their guest of honor , then erupted in cheers and tumultuous ovations after his every third sentence .
He drove out a higher percentage of Jews from Cuba than Czar Nicholas drove from Russia .
Yet Shoah Foundation Founder Stephen Spielberg , considered his dinner with Fidel Castro , “ the eight most important hours of my life . ”
He ’s a lily - white European soldier ’s son who forcibly overthrew a Cuban government where Blacks served as President of the Senate , Minister of Agriculture , Chief of Army , and Head of State ( Fulgencio Batista , the grandson of slaves , and born in a palm - roofed shack ) .
Then jailed the longest suffering black political prisoner of modern history ( Eusebio Penalver who suffered longer in Castro ’s dungeon ’s than Nelson Mandela suffered in South Africa ’s ) .
Today the prison population in Stalinist / Apartheid Cuba is 90 percent black while only 9 percent of the ruling Stalinist party is black .
He sentenced other blacks ( Dr. Elias Biscet , Jorge Antunez ) to 20 - year sentences essentially for quoting Martin Luther King in a public square .
Yet he ’s a hero to the Congressional Black Caucus and receives frequent accolades and even passionate bear hugs from Charles Rangel and Jesse Jackson .
He converted a nation with a higher per capita income than half of Europe , the lowest inflation rate in the Western hemisphere , a larger middle class than Switzerland and a huge influx of immigrants into one that repels Haitians .
Yet , Colin Powell and the London Times , ( owned by Rupert Murdoch ) have recognized “ the Castro Revolution ’s achievements . ”
In brief , except among “ right - wing crackpots , ” Cuba is ritually discussed , not with facts or reasoned observations , but with handy ( and bogus ) clichs .
Che Guevara ’s delight in slaughtering Cubans was made possible only because these Cubans were completely defenseless at the time .
Bound and blindfolded was his preference .
And in that very manner they were lined up in front of his firing squads .
In other settings featuring firearms ( held by others ) the troubled Argentine quivered with fear .
On Oct. 8 1967 , for instance , upon finally encountering armed and determined enemies , Che quickly dropped his fully - loaded weapons .
“ Do n’t shoot ! ” he whimpered .
“ I ’m Che !
I ’m worth more to you alive than dead ! ”
His Bolivian captors viewed the matter differently .
In fact they adopted a policy that has since become a favorite among Americans who encounter ( so - called ) endangered species on their property : “ Shoot , shovel , and shut - up . ”
Justice has never been better served .

A ticketed news vehicle at Grand and Central Police Headquarters where Chicago Police officer Anthony Abbate had a court appearance .
Chicago Police cars block the driveway , inset , as they attempt to help Abbate leave through a back door .
( AP / NBC5 )
Anthony Abbate should have walked in and out of a Cook County courthouse like any other accused criminal Tuesday morning , Chicago Police Supt .
Phil Cline said .
Instead , the burly Chicago cop , who is accused of pummeling a petite female bartender during a drunken rage , was shielded from the media by on - duty Grand Central District officers , who apparently were acting on the orders of their captain when they used police vehicles to hide Abbate as he left the Northwest Side courthouse .
By evening , an angry Cline announced he was demoting the captain and investigating other allegations against police officers , including that they ticketed the cars of reporters trying to cover Abbate 's hearing and threatened them with arrest .
Cline 's comments came on the day he had planned to announce a new policy that will allow the department to move faster against rogue cops .
The policy was in response to Abbate 's case and an unrelated incident in which off - duty Chicago cops allegedly beat four patrons at a West Loop bar on Dec. 15 .
Both incidents were caught on security video , although only Abbate 's has been made public .
Rather than simply announce the new procedure Tuesday , Cline and his staff were forced to answer questions about why their officers were protecting Abbate .
The captain , a 24 - year veteran , ordered at least four squad cars to block off a parking lot at the courthouse , which is housed at the district station , and an adjacent private lot to try to " control " the media , officials said .
Somebody in authority also apparently allowed Abbate to slip out a rear entrance , avoiding cameras and reporters .
Cline said he was stunned by the special treatment , saying of Abbate : " He 's tarnished our image worse than anybody else in the history of the department . "
Abbate has been stripped of his police powers , and the department is moving to fire him because of the Feb. 19 beating , video images of which were replayed around the world .
Cline also said six officers allegedly involved in the second beating have been stripped of their police powers -- which Cline said should have happened weeks ago .
When the department was alerted to the beating -- which occurred at the Jefferson Tap & Grille -- investigators with the department 's Office of Professional Standards viewed the video within five days .
The video reportedly shows an off - duty sergeant waving away on - duty officers who responded to 911 calls .
Prosecutors saw the video by the end of the month , Cline said .
The officers were reassigned pending the criminal investigation , Cline said .
" In hindsight , this incident should have been handled differently , " Cline said .
" These officers should have been stripped of their police powers sooner .
The incident has made me realize we need to tighten up our ps to ensure that officers who participate in this type of behavior do not remain on the street . "
Under his new policy , police brass will meet with Cook County prosecutors within 48 hours of an officer being accused of serious criminal behavior .
If prosecutors believe there is a strong case against the officers , they will be immediately stripped of their police powers , Cline said .
A grim - faced Cline , who addressed the beatings with his full command staff standing behind him , said the changes are going to make the force stronger .
But he could n't deny the damage already done to the public trust .
" The past two weeks have been disheartening and embarrassing for me , personally and professionally , " Cline said .
" It is especially demoralizing for the 13,600 who serve this department honorably everyday .
. . .
They , too , are sickened and embarrassed . "
Albert Mohler of the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary believes that Christians should support pre-natal screening to " treat " gay fetuses in utero .
Mohler sparked controversy with a blog post called Is Your Baby Gay ?.
Not surprisingly , non-bigots took issue with Mohler 's assertion that homosexuality is a disease that requires treatment .
There 's a long and reprehensible history of doctors forcing dangerous and ineffective hormones on gay people in an attempt to modify their sexual preferences .
It 's nothing new to conceal coercion by framing a disapproved behavior as a disease and offering to " cure " it .
Some countries still use coercive hormone injections as a weapon against gays .
I 'm certainly not surprised that Mohler would like to inflict these treatments on non-consenting fetuses , and I might add , their mothers .
Any " treatment " that might be inflicted on a suspected gay fetus would almost certainly have side effects for the mother .
In Mohler 's estimation , homosexuality is such a blight that it must be stamped out before the fetus even enters our world .
If he thought through the implications of homosexuality " treatments " in utero on the mother , I 'm sure he'd think that it was a woman 's responsibility to absorb the risk .
Convenient .
I wonder what he'd say if it were discovered that fathers who take pre-conception hormones are less likely to sire gay offspring ?
What 's more interesting is the controversy that Mohler 's remarks generated among fellow conservative evangelicals .
They are outraged that Mohler would even suggest that people are born gay .
It 's interesting that so many conservative Christians cling so strongly to the idea of voluntarism in sexual orientation .
Do they have any theological arguments to bolster this reflexive assertion , even to other believers like Mohler ?
It seems like the extent to which biology influences sexual orientation is a purely empirical question .
People who put too much emotional stake in nature / nurture questions are usually trying to shirk the harder work of making a defensible value judgment .
If you believe as a matter of principle that all sexual orientations are equally compatible with human flourishing , and that free choice of sexual partners is a human right , then it does n't really matter whether people are born with their orientation or not .
It 's an interesting empirical question , but there are very few moral implications .
Likewise , as long as Mohler and his ilk cling to the idea that homosexuality is wrong or bad , it does n't really matter whether some people are more predisposed to want things they " should n't " have .
We 've always assumed that every human is biologically predisposed towards lust , gluttony , anger , sloth , and a variety of other purported sins .
So , why are anti-gay Christians squabbling amongst themselves over the empirical details of one particular disposition ?

As politicians outline rival visions of a green agenda , an airline has angered environmental campaigners for flying an empty passenger plane in order to keep hold of its landing slots .
The British Mediterranean Airways ( BMed ) round - trip flights between London 's Heathrow and Cardiff International have been taking off six days a week since October .
They have not appeared on departure or arrival boards , none of the 124 tickets were sold and all passenger seats remained empty .
And to the chagrin of green campaigners more than five tonnes of CO2 has been pumped into the atmosphere on each 140 - mile journey .
But why would an airline be prepared to run hundreds of flights at a loss ?
Industry experts said the incident was rare but illustrative of an airline protecting its highly sought - after landing slots at Heathrow , which have been known to fetch up to £ 10 m each .
' Cost - effective '
BMed acknowledged the situation was " not ideal " and said it was temporary .
It disputes reports that the empty flights have cost it £ 2 m , but acknowledges a business motive lay behind the decision .
The airline started the empty flights after scrapping its service to Tashkent in Uzbekistan , in the wake of civil unrest .
It is a crazy situation but the tax regime supports this kind of behaviour
Richard Dyer , Friends of the Earth
The internationally recognised landing slot policy independently administered at Heathrow by the firm Airport Co-ordination Ltd ( ACL ) is known as the Use it or Lose it rule .
An airline needs to make at least 80 % use of its allocation over a six - month session to preserve the entitlement or it risks seeing rivals take over the slot .
There are provisions for airlines not to use slots and still retain rights if this can be justified on the basis of " unforeseeable " circumstances .
However , this would normally only cover a short period .
BMed decided it was not practical to formally launch a passenger service just for a few months .
The airline , which flies to 17 destinations throughout Africa , the Middle East and Central Asia , says it will start using the slot again for commercial flights in April 2007 .
" Since BMed intends to operate the slot on revenue services during the 2007 summer and winter seasons , it was necessary to preserve the slot , " said BMed chief executive , David Richardson .
" Flights to Cardiff represented the most cost - effective way to do this . "
' Crazy situation '
Environmental campaigners said the flights showed up " anomalies " in the current air tax system .
" It is a crazy situation but the tax regime supports this kind of behaviour , " said Richard Dyer from Friends of the Earth .
" If you had a system in place , such as the one the Lib Dems and Conservatives propose where airlines pay a tax on every plane based on carbon emissions , there would be a much greater incentive not to run these kind of flights . "
Cardiff International airport , meanwhile , stressed it had no power to refuse BMed landing slots .
" It would be inappropriate and unworkable for it to act as an arbiter in relation to the nature of one airline 's operations in comparison to those of other airlines , " it said in a statement .
An ACL spokesperson said : " No other airlines are doing this .
It is not a common occurrence but airlines are free to use their slots as they wish . "
President Bush passes himself off as a conservative Republican and a born - again Christian .
These are disguises behind which Bush hides .
Would a Christian invade another country on false pretenses , kill tens of thousands of innocent civilians , and show no remorse or inclination to cease the aggression ?
Long - time Republican policy - wonk Bruce Bartlett recently published a book , Impostor , in which he proves that President Bush is no economic conservative , having broken all records in spending taxpayers ’ money and running up public debt .
Were Bush merely another big spender , his presidency would n’t differ from other pork barrel administrations , but Bush ’s radicalism goes far beyond spending .
Bush supports outsourcing American jobs , and he has taken an irreverent approach to the U.S. Constitution .
Bush bears no resemblance to a political conservative .
A political conservative does not confuse government with country .
Patriotism means loyalty to country .
Bush , however , demands allegiance to his government : " You are with us or against us ! " Critics of the Bush administration are branded " unpatriotic " and even " treasonous . "
Loyalty to country means allegiance to the Constitution , the Bill of Rights and the separation of powers .
It does not mean blind support for a president , an administration , or a political party .
The separation of powers and civil liberties that were bequeathed to us by the Founding Fathers are the protectors of our liberty .
Bush , who swore on the Bible that he would defend and uphold the Constitution , has made it clear that he will not let the Constitution get in the way of expanding the powers of his office .
Bush has over - ridden a number of protections in the Bill of Rights .
The right to assemble and to demonstrate has been infringed .
The Secret Service now routinely removes protesters from the scene of Bush political events .
Many unthinking Americans go along with this authoritarianism because they do n’t agree with the protesters , but once the right is lost , everyone loses it .
Bush has ignored habeas corpus and claims the unconstitutional power to arrest and detain people indefinitely without a warrant and without presenting charges to a judge .
This is the most dangerous abuse of all , because whoever is in office can use this power against political opponents .
Many unthinking Americans are not concerned , because they think this power will be used only against terrorists .
However , as the Bush administration has admitted , many of its detainees are not terrorists .
Most are innocent people kidnapped by tribal leaders and sold to the U.S. for the bounties paid for " terrorists . "
Bush has refused to obey statutory law , specifically the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ( FISA ) .
Bush claims that as commander - in - chief he has the right to ignore the law and to spy on Americans without a warrant .
Many unthinking Americans are unconcerned , saying that as they are doing nothing wrong they have nothing to fear .
This attitude misses the point in a large way .
If a president can establish himself above one law , he can establish himself above all laws .
There is no line drawn through the law that divides the laws between the ones the president must obey and the ones he need not obey .
FISA does not interfere with government spying for national security purposes .
Secrecy is protected , because the court of federal judges that issues the warrants is secret .
Moreover the law allows the government to spy first and then come to the court for a warrant .
The purpose of the warrant is to be sure that the government is spying for legitimate purposes and not abusing the power to spy on political opponents for nefarious purposes .
When presidents sign a bill passed by Congress that they think might be interpreted in ways that could impinge on the powers of their office , they add a " signing statement " to protect traditional presidential powers .
Under Bush this practice has exploded .
Bush has used signing statements considerably in excess of all previous presidents combined .
Moreover , Bush uses the statements not to protect president powers , but to nullify acts of Congress , such as Republican Senator John McCain ’s law against torture .
Bush is using signing statements to turn the presidency into a dictatorship in which the executive is not accountable to laws passed by Congress .
The next step is simply to announce that the executive is not accountable to elections either .
Bush ’s government is the first in our history in which there are no dissenting voices and no debate .
Uniformity of opinion is more characteristic of a dictatorial government than a conservative one .
Bush ’s government is all of one mind , because all important positions are held by neoconservatives .
Neoconservative is a deceptive term .
It means " new conservatives , " but there is nothing conservative about neocons .
Neoconservatives believe in imposing their agenda on other countries — the antithesis of American conservatism .
In short , real conservatives believe in conserving the Constitution , government accountability , and civil liberties , and avoiding foreign entanglements .
Judging by its behavior and its statements , the Bush administration stands completely outside the conservative tradition .

Ming Shun felt embarrassed .
Not for himself , but for someone else ( " Gabrielle " ) in his Introduction to Web Development course .
It seemed that , almost every day , Gabrielle would just say something that made everyone grit their teeth and say under their breath , I can't believe she just said that .
While the course was n't at the graduate - level , it was n't at the entry - level , either .
Web Development was at the 200 - course ( i.e. second - year ) and had its share of prerequisites , ranging from Intro to Computer Science to Concepts of Digital Logic .
Gabrielle not only lacked the fundamentals from these courses , but seemed to lack even the most basic understanding of computers .
On the first day of class , she struggled for a full five minutes trying to turn on the computer before someone finally pointed out that she had to press the " power " button on the front of the case .
The first few lessons in the course focused on HTML and , despite repeated help and instruction from others in the class , Gabrielle just could n't get it right .
She started ever page with a < BODY > tag instead of the proper < HTML > tag , and insisted that it made more sense that way because HTML was " the language " and not a part of " the code . "
Her " proof " of this was that , thanks to Internet Explorer 's forgiving nature , the pages rendered just fine .
Gabrielle 's grasp of " documents " versus " programs " was just as painfully embarrassing .
After editing an HTML document , she 'd always say , " OK , I 'm now saving my HTML program and will run it in Internet Explorer . "
I wo n't even get into how much Gabrielle struggled with doing actual web development in PHP .
Now I suppose this story is one that can describe just about every struggling Computer Science student that will eventually change their major to Communications .
There 's only one difference : Gabrielle was not a student in the Web Development course .
She taught it .
Sadly , this just reinforces that old ( and often untrue ) adage : those who can , do ; those who can't do , teach ; those who can't teach , teach gym ; and those who can't teach gym , teach Introduction to Web Development at WTFU .
A 41 - second pro forma Senate session convened under the Republican majority last year gave the country an extra full year of President Bush ’s most controversial recess appointments .
On January 4 , 2006 , Bush announced a list of 17 recess appointments from hell , an obnoxious mix of unworthies so rife with cronyism , nepotism , incompetence and unqualified nominees that he could n’t get them confirmed even in an accommodating , toadying Republican Senate .
Among those included on the magic list were Gordon England ( DOD ) , Julie Myers ( Homeland Security ) , Ellen Sauerbrey ( State Department ) and Hans von Spakovsky ( FEC ) , who ’s spent his term arm - twisting to ensure prejudiced appraisals of attorneys in the Civil Rights Division .
As In These Times summed up the recess appointments at the time :
On January 4 , Bush used the congressional recess to bypass the Senate confirmation process and appoint 17 officials to posts in the State Department , Federal Election Commission , National Labor Relations Board and other federal offices .
The recess appointments avoided floor fights over dubiously credentialed nominees , including a former oil executive , a former president of a weapons manufacturer and a relative of a cabinet employee .
All told , they include eight donors to Bush ’s presidential campaigns .
Perhaps , like the Washington Post , readers here assumed these incompetents would be gone in January 2007 with the new Congress .
They were , after all , seemingly appointed between sessions of Congress , which would have required their terms to end at the close of the previous session , according to CRS ( warning : PDF ) :
If the President makes a recess appointment between sessions or between Congresses , that appointment will expire at the end of the following session .
As opposed to during a session of Congress :
If he makes the appointment during a recess in the middle of a session , that appointment also will expire at the end of the following session .
In this case , the duration of the appointment will include the balance of the session in progress plus the full length of the session that follows .
So why are the hacktacular 17 still hanging hacktacularly around ?
Here ’s where it gets really interesting .
The Senate calendar on the Democratic site shows no meeting until Congress opened on January 18 , 2006 , which would lead one to assume that date marked the opening of the second year of the 109th Congress .
But the Library of Congress indicates a session was held on January 3 , 2006 , thus officially opening the 109th .
And lo and behold , the Daily Digest reports a 41 - second pro forma Senate session , from 12:00:04 PM to 12:00:45 P.M. , on that date .
The Senate convened , immediately adjourned and thus began a " recess in the middle of the session , " not meeting again until January 18 , 2006 .
The day following the less - than - a - minute convening , of course , Bush made his recess appointments — now officially during a session of Congress — which allowed his eminently rejectable appointees to complete the " balance of the session in progress plus the full length of the session that follows . "
Meaning we ’re stuck with this gang of uncomfirmable , incompetent , unqualified losers for an extra year .
Fool me once , shame on you .
Fool me again and again and again and again ... and you can pretty much begin warming up for a dirge for democracy .
It just never ends , does it ?

Martin made a pointed appeal
Paul Martin was speaking at the UN climate change conference in Montreal , where talks on long - term strategies are reaching a critical stage .
It is not only the United States which has come under fire .
A British government minister has accused Saudi Arabia of using " outrageous " tactics to block progress .
' In this together '
Mr Martin , who is in the second week of his own campaign for re-election , formally opened the ministerial section of the conference on Wednesday .
His speech was clearly aimed at the United States , although he did not mention the country by name .
He told delegates from around 190 countries that " climate change is a global challenge that demands a global response , yet there are nations that resist ...
" Well , it is our problem to solve .
We are in this together . "
At a news conference after the speech , Mr Martin referred explicitly to Canada 's neighbours to the south , saying : " To the reticent nations , including the United States , I would say this : there is such a thing as a global conscience , and now is the time to listen to it . "
' Parallel track '
One of the main controversies at this conference is an attempt by the Canadian Environment Minister , Stephane Dion , who is chairing the talks , to launch a two - year process of discussions outside the jurisdiction of the Kyoto agreement , which the US has rejected .
The aim is to set up a " parallel track " to discuss various options for taking forward international action , which would enable both the Americans and developing countries to participate without committing themselves to specific targets on cutting or limiting emissions .
The theory is that this would make it easier for those countries signed up to Kyoto to commit themselves to stronger legally - binding emission cuts when the current targets expire in 2012 .
On the face of it , the Canadian proposal is so bland as to be meaningless , calling for " discussions to explore and analyse approaches for long - term co-operative action " .
The wording has in fact been carefully chosen to mirror language used in previous agreements at Gleneagles under the UK presidency of the Group of Eight ( G8 ) leading economies , and at the UN World Summit in New York .
Both of those were signed up to by the United States .
Even so , this proposal has so far been rejected by the US , which is wary of entering any process which might be seen as the first stage of a new Kyoto - style agreement .
Asked about the Canadian proposal , the head of the US delegation in Montreal , Paula Dobriansky , said " the best approach is one that takes into account diversified approaches and differing opinions .
One size does not fit all . "
Saudi ' villains '
This attitude is causing exasperation amongst negotiators from the European Union , who feel that it is a step backwards from commitments made by President George W Bush during this year 's British presidency of the G8 .
HAVE YOUR SAY Global warming has become an issue everywhere

" They are the villains of the piece , " Mr Morley told reporters in Montreal .
He described the Saudi tactics as " outrageous " , claiming that they were blocking every discussion and exerting a negative influence on the conference .
The databases are primarily intended to prevent people from obtaining multiple licenses under different names .
That can help prevent identity theft and stop people who try to get a second license after their first has been suspended .
“ The states are finding hundreds of cases of fraud each year in each state , ” said J. Scott Carr , executive vice president of the Digimarc Corporation , which says it has sold biometric technology to motor vehicle departments in seven states and has a role in the production of more than two - thirds of all driver ’s licenses in the United States .
But the databases can also be used for law enforcement purposes beyond detecting fraud .
A page concerning Mr. Howell , printed out from the “ America ’s Most Wanted ” Web site , is taped to the wall of the investigators ’ office here .
It is a kind of trophy .
“ It ’s always exciting when you get a hit and you ’re getting someone really bad off the streets , ” said Maria Conlon , a facial - recognition specialist at the Registry of Motor Vehicles .
“ That ’s when everyone ’s morale goes up . ”
Most of the work is less glamorous .
The analysts ’ main job is to check roughly 5,000 new driver ’s license photographs every day against the database .
A computer algorithm that takes into account about 8,000 facial data points does a rough cut , and analysts examine potential matches , rejecting the vast majority .
That computers alone cannot do the job does not surprise Richard M. Smith , an expert in digital security .
“ It ’s probably one of the more inaccurate biometrics , ” Mr. Smith said , referring to facial - recognition technologies .
After computers narrow the field of potential matches , Ms. Conlon and her colleagues get to work .
“ We do n’t look at hair , ” Ms. Conlon said .
“ We do look at lips , noses , ears . ”
情報サービス産業に対しては，人月単価ベースのビジネスモデルがいけない，エンジニアを使い捨てている，高い単価でオフショアとどう戦うのか，とかいろいろなことがいわれているし，どっかに活路がないものかなとここ数年いろいろ調べたりもしたのだけれども，最近ふと別に情報サービス産業に明日がなくても構わないじゃないか，と考えるようになった．
結局のところ要件定義や仕様書に基づいてシステムをつくるという仕事は，ITが生む付加価値そのものを受け取るようにビジネスモデルができていないのだ．技術や製品・専門知識に希少性があった時代はそれでも儲かったが，ハードやソフト，それらに対する知識がコモディティ化した瞬間，サービスやソリューションそのものがコモディティ化することは避けられなかったのだろう．
僕はIT自体にはまだまだ可能性があると思うけれども，徐々にレントがIT製品を扱う企業から，ITを活用して新しい価値を生む側に移転するのは自然で避けがたい動きである気がする．そして彼らにとってソフトとは自分たちが使うためにつくるもので，仕様書通りかではなく，これまで以上に業務と一体で見直されるものになるのではないか．
いや仕様書がないからよいソフトウェアとは限らないんだけど．Rubyにも，Linuxにも，Windowsにも，きっと厳密な意味での仕様書ってないんだよね．何故それが許されるかというと，パッケージ製品であれば開発時にはVision StatementとかPersonaとかは定義して，つくりながら試行錯誤して，時々世に問い，何かいわれたら「それが仕様です」と返すし，オープンソースであれば「ソースを読めば」「自分で直せよ」と．
すごく乱暴に論じると開発生産性が高まれば高まるほど，厳密に仕様書を書くことは難しくなるはずだ．何故なら実装言語の記述効率は着々と上がっても，自然言語の記述効率はさほど上がらないからだ．DSLとか形式言語を使って記述効率を上げるという議論もあるけれど，ツール群が充実してDSLと実装とをいったりきたりできるようになると，そもそもDSL記述って仕様なのか実装なのか微妙なところだ．
仕様書が受託開発に於いて重要なのは，仕様書に基づいた実装を完了することが検収の条件となるからだ．他人のためにつくるから何をつくるかの約束事が必要なのであって，自分のためにつくるとか，自分のつくったものを不特定多数のひとに使ってもらう分には，厳密な仕様書などいらない訳だ．
そして往々にして仕様書の出来が悪いのは，プログラムを書けない奴が仕様書を起こすからである．どうつくるかという想像力に欠けていることもあるし，本当に必要とされていることを精製されていないこともある．プログラマにとって苛立たしいのは，自分よりも馬鹿の書いた仕様書に振り回されて，クールでも本質的でもないことに工数を割くことである．
優秀なエンジニアは面白い仕事を探す．だからプログラムを書けない奴が長々とした会議や仕様書を通じてプログラマに足枷をはめるような職場からは，優秀なエンジニアは段々と逃げ出していくだろう．
そう考えると旧来の定義での情報サービス産業に優秀なプログラマが残るとは考え難い．自律的で優秀なプログラマが，駄目な奴と十把一絡げで人月単価で計算され，使い捨てられるような仕事に就くだろうか．時間的な仕事量ではなく，仕事の質や意味を通じて，成果を出し，評価を受け得る領域に行こうとするだろう．
IT 産業の内側なら，他人のいうことを聞くのではなくて自分の考えを世に問うことのできるパッケージやSaaSの方が面白いし，ICTを使ってICT産業の外側で新しいビジネスモデルを組み立ててれば，システム構築だけでなくビジネス自体から継続的な収益を上げることができる．
もはや大企業に於ける業務のITによる作業の自動化といった領域は概ね開拓され尽くされていて，そこには大きな市場があるし価格破壊による新規参入の余地もあるが，基本的に煮詰まった成熟市場だ．だから，これまで充分にIT投資を行っていない中小企業とか，これまでと全く違った商流をつくるC2C的なサービスの方が面白そうだ．
仮に狭義の情報サービス産業が成熟しているとしても，これから出てくる新産業がITと関わっていない可能性の方が低い．ベンチャーによるIT企業への投資がネットバブル時の1割ほどで，多くの資金がバイオとか医療に流れているという話があるけれども，バイオだって医療だって最先端の技術には最先端のITが活用されている．飲食や流通といった既存の産業でも，ITが作業の自動化だけでなく，新しい市場や価値を生む機会がいくらでもある．
既存の商流やビジネスドメインを効率化するとかではなくて，がらっと変えてしまうようなイノベーションは，これまでのようなユーザー企業とITベンダとで要件定義や仕様書で線を引いた受発注関係ではなく，創り手が自発的に創造性を発揮し，その質に応じて報われるビジネス構造から生まれる可能性が高いのではないか．そういった実社会と深く結びついた革新のために，エンジニアが知恵を絞ることができるような事業構造はどうすれば可能なのだろうか．
I have been thinking about software architects lately .
Some , if not most , companies hate to see ' software architect ' on a resume , and do n't want to hire anyone into that role .
My last employer ( not my current ) always said they wanted me to step up to that role , but also that customers do n't pay for architecture , and it is not very important .
Nothing could be farther from the truth .
Customers pay big for architecture , but they do n't pay for good architecture , they pay for bad architecture .
If everything is architected well ( like my current job ) , existing code rarely needs changed , and most new development involves thinking about what the product should do and how it should do it .
If everything is architected poorly , all the time is spent fixing the same problem over and over .
People blame coders for lacking " attention to detail " , when 2000 lines of code are used to do the job of 200 .
New development is slow and tedious , the " what the product should do and how it should do it " either becomes big upfront design , or becomes an afterthought .
Products are released that are unsupportable , and if they crash , the only way to find out what code is at fault is by the whole development team staying hours late going through Dr. Watson logs and spaghetti code .
Obviously , products developed this way are more expensive .
What some people think of as good architects are problems to .
Big companies pay a few " architects " six figure salaries to sit in a private office isolated from the team , draw fancy Visio diagrams about complex " frameworks " and " reusable components " , and tell coders what to code .
This make projects more expensive too ( although never as bad as the first scenario ) .
These architects are probably responsible for most of the negativity people have about hiring architects .
They are probably the architects Joel talked about in " Do n't Let Architecture Astronauts Scare You " - although I blame salespeople for that ( more on that later ) .
So are architects really needed ?
Read about the most popular real world architecture style - Big Ball of Mud .
Most agile coding ( Scrum , XP ) seems to frown on ( or ignore ) architecture .
It seems most of the successful projects are those that ignore architecture completely , but end up with a well enough architected code base to avoid the first scenario .
But this is far from optimal , and usually happens by chance .
So what is the solution ?
I remember back to my days being an undergrad , and Dr Gowda 's class .
The most important lesson he always stressed was coupling and cohesion .
This goes back to Structured Design by Larry Constantine in 1974 , before I was even born .
With things like " object oriented " and " agile methodologies " becoming more and more popular , no one likes the idea that the solution to most of our problems is over 30 years old .
If a complicated and large system , no matter how otherwise badly designed , is loosely coupled , it can be fixed and used and maintained .
Once a solutions develops bad , tight coupling system wide ( to the point it cannot be decoupled ) , you have to throw it away , or all your efforts become more and more difficult , and eventually wasted .
I think this is largely the role of architects - to avoid excessive coupling within the system , to prevent it from degrading to this point , and to recognize if this happens .
Beyond that , architects are useful to review code , ensure good programing practices are followed , and spend the rest of their time doing development .
Is this is best left to one or a few team members designated as " architects " or best done by everyone ?
I think it is best done by everyone on the team .
Think of it like a photoblog with no pictures .
An argument that improperly assumes as true the very point the speaker is trying to argue for is said in formal logic to “ beg the question . ”
Here is an example of a question - begging argument : “ This painting is trash because it is obviously worthless . ”
The speaker is simply asserting the worthlessness of the work , not presenting any evidence to demonstrate that this is in fact the case .
Since we never use “ begs ” with this odd meaning ( “ to improperly take for granted ” ) in any other phrase , most people now suppose the phrase implies something quite different : that the argument demands that a question about it be asked — raises the question .
Although using the expression in its original sense is now rare , using it in the newer sense will cause irritation among traditionalists .

MERVYN KING , governor of the Bank of England , has long cherished the ambition of making British monetary policy boring .
Instead it has become rather exciting thanks to the announcement of an unexpected jump in inflation .
Scenting a rise in interest rates when the bank 's monetary - policy committee ( MPC ) next meets in early May , foreign - exchange dealers responded by pushing sterling just above $ 2 on Tuesday April 17th , the first time it has reached this iconic level since September 1992 .
The consensus forecast in the markets was that consumer - price inflation would stay steady in the year to March at 2.8 % , the same as in February .
Instead it rose to 3.1 % , the highest since August 1992 .
That number may not sound iconic but it matters a lot under the current arrangement for monetary policy .
The framework was set by Gordon Brown , the chancellor of the exchequer ( Britain 's finance minister ) , almost immediately after Labour won power in May 1997 .
Mr Brown granted the bank operational independence to set interest rates and gave it the task of ensuring that inflation stayed at the government 's target , which is currently 2 % a year for consumer prices .
If inflation strayed by more than a percentage point in either direction , the bank 's governor would have to write an open letter to the chancellor explaining why this had happened and what the MPC proposed to do about it .
When the arrangement was established , the chances of such a public letter seemed high given the past volatility of inflation .
Calculations in 1998 by Charles Bean of the London School of Economics , who subsequently became the bank 's chief economist , suggested that inflation was likely to be more than a percentage point away from the target around 40 % of the time .
Now , for the first time in the past ten years — ironically on the eve of the tenth anniversary of the bank 's independence — a governor has had to put pen to paper .
Mr King 's letter may have been a first but it contained little to add to the stress levels of City analysts , already caught out by guessing the inflation figure wrong .
In a crucial sentence , the governor said that the news seemed “ unlikely to alter the broad picture painted in the February [ Inflation ] Report ” , when it last published its quarterly economic outlook .
That suggests two things .
First , the bank dropped the broadest of hints in that report that it would raise interest rates by a further quarter - point before too long .
One of its projections showed that if the base rate were held at 5.25 % , inflation would exceed the 2 % target in two years ' time , the period that it takes for monetary policy to have its maximum effect on prices .
A rate rise to 5.5 % now looks a near certainty when the MPC meets on May 10th .
Second , the bank remains pretty confident that inflation is lapping close to its high - water mark and will soon recede fast to around 2 % .
Mr King reminded the chancellor in his letter that the central outlook in the February report was for “ inflation to fall a little below the target by the end of this year , before settling at around the target during the following year ” .
The main reason for this confidence is that gas and electricity prices , which climbed exceptionally fast in 2006 , are expected to fall sharply this year .
Still , the bank remains rightly concerned about underlying inflationary pressures .
Monetary growth has been rapid and there has been a resurgence in house - price inflation .
And , although recent pay deals have been surprisingly subdued , there are worrying signs that businesses now feel they can push through price increases .
The bank is likely to remain quite hawkish until it is sure that inflationary expectations have been bolted back to the 2 % target .
Interest rates have already risen from 4.5 % last summer to 5.25 % .
Britain 's inflation surprise increases the likelihood that they could rise to as high as 5.75 % later this year .
Encrypted bandwidth - efficient backup using the rsync algorithm
Duplicity backs directories by producing encrypted tar - format volumes and uploading them to a remote or local file server .
Because duplicity uses librsync , the incremental archives are space efficient and only record the parts of files that have changed since the last backup .
Because duplicity uses GnuPG to encrypt and / or sign these archives , they will be safe from spying and / or modification by the server .
The duplicity package also includes the rdiffdir utility .
Rdiffdir is an extension of librsync 's rdiff to directories --- it can be used to produce signatures and deltas of directories as well as regular files .
These signatures and deltas are in GNU tar format .
Duplicity is fairly mature software .
As any software , it may still have a few bugs , but will work for normal usage and is in use now for large personal and corporate backups .
If you have questions try the mailing list .
Bug reports and bug fixes can be entered through the Launchpad project page .

AFP
THE American army delivered an apology and blood money on Tuesday May 8th to the families of 19 Afghan civilians killed in March by marines .
As in similar cases in Afghanistan and Iraq the killings , which took place on a road near Jalalabad in eastern Afghanistan , were discovered by journalists and initially misrepresented by American commanders .
Announcing the climb - down , an American colonel in Afghanistan told reporters : “ I stand before you today deeply , deeply ashamed and terribly sorry that Americans have killed and wounded innocent Afghan people . ”
This is unlikely to prevent many more such incidents .
The killing of large numbers of civilians by American forces , through indisciplined firing or as a result of their heavy reliance on air - strikes , has been a bitter feature of the campaigns in Afghanistan and Iraq — just as it was in Vietnam .
Indeed , later on Tuesday at least 21 civilians were killed in air - strikes in the southern province of Helmand , according to Asadullah Wafa , its pro-American governor .
In Iraq on Wednesday , according to local security sources , an American helicopter involved in an attack against suspected insurgents killed a number of children at a primary school north of Baghdad .
Since the killings in Afghanistan in March , American troops in that country — mostly from a counter - terrorism contingent that is operating outside the main American - led NATO peacekeeping force — are alleged to have killed civilians on at least five occasions .
Late in April at least 57 civilians are said to have been slain in American air - strikes at Shindand , in western Afghanistan .
The slaughter in Jalalabad appears to have occurred in similar circumstances to the better - known murder in 2005 of 24 Iraqi civilians in Haditha , in western Iraq .
After being attacked by a suicide bomber , American marine special forces allegedly retaliated by shooting at every Afghan in sight .
Another 50 civilians were wounded in their attack .
As in Haditha , the marines then tried hiding their bloody tracks .
Afghan journalists at the scene had video film confiscated and digital photographs deleted from their cameras .
American officials claimed that the marines had faced a “ complex ambush ” , with Taliban marksmen hidden among the civilians .
The Taliban are capable of such tactics .
Before last week 's violence in Shindand , a tally by the Associated Press showed 151 civilians had been killed in Afghanistan this year , including 100 by the Taliban .
Another estimate , by Human Rights Watch , suggests that more than 1,000 Afghan civilians died in violent attacks in 2006 , more than half of them the victims of Taliban assaults .
Yet there appears to be no evidence that the marines near Jalalabad came under attack after the bomb - blast .
America 's Department of Defence has launched a criminal investigation into the incident .
The family of each slain Afghan has received $ 2,000 .
More such payouts could soon follow .
The fighting in Shindand , between April 27th and 29th , began with a failed American special forces operation to grab a local warlord and suspected Taliban ally , Mullah Akhtar .
A former Taliban commander , he had previously received support from the Afghan government ( and allegedly from American forces ) against another warlord , Ismael Khan .
In the attempt to capture him , according to an American army press release , 136 Taliban fighters and one American soldier were killed , but no civilians .
A team of UN and government investigators sent to Shindand last week found several hundred houses destroyed by air - strikes and heard reports of many civilians dead and injured .
Some 1,600 families had fled the area .
Among the dead were said to be many children , including some who had drowned after diving into a river to escape the onslaught .
In response to early reports of a massacre in Shindand , Afghanistan 's leader , Hamid Karzai , warned that Afghans ' patience with the foreign troops in their midst was “ wearing thin ” .
Mr Karzai has issued similar warnings after previous American atrocities .
But there is evidence to suggest that he may be right .
Last week several hundred students gathered near Jalalabad to protest against a separate , recent incident in which civilians , including at least one woman , were alleged to have been killed by American special - forces fighters .
In their slogans they held George Bush and Mr Karzai himself to blame .
The Inflation Tax
by Ron Paul by Ron Paul
All government spending represents a tax .
The inflation tax , while largely ignored , hurts middle - class and low - income Americans the most .
Simply put , printing money to pay for federal spending dilutes the value of the dollar , which causes higher prices for goods and services .
Inflation may be an indirect tax , but it is very real — the individuals who suffer most from cost of living increases certainly pay a tax . 
Unfortunately no one in Washington , especially those who defend the poor and the middle class , cares about this subject .
Instead , all we hear is that tax cuts for the rich are the source of every economic ill in the country .
Anyone truly concerned about the middle class suffering from falling real wages , under - employment , a rising cost of living , and a decreasing standard of living should pay a lot more attention to monetary policy .
Federal spending , deficits , and Federal Reserve mischief hurt the poor while transferring wealth to the already rich .
This is the real problem , and raising taxes on those who produce wealth will only make conditions worse .
Borrowing money to cut the deficit is only marginally better than raising taxes .
It may delay the pain for a while , but the cost of government eventually must be paid .
Federal borrowing means the cost of interest is added , shifting the burden to a different group than those who benefited and possibly even to another generation .
Eventually borrowing is always paid for through taxation .
The third option is for the Federal Reserve to create credit to pay the bills Congress runs up .
Nobody objects , and most Members hope that deficits do n’t really matter if the Fed accommodates Congress by creating more money .
Besides , interest payments to the Fed are lower than they would be if funds were borrowed from the public , and payments can be delayed indefinitely merely by creating more credit out of thin air to buy U.S. treasuries .
No need to soak the rich .
A good deal , it seems , for everyone .
But is it ?
The tax is paid when prices rise as the result of a depreciating dollar .
Savers and those living on fixed or low incomes are hardest hit as the cost of living rises .
Low - and middle - incomes families suffer the most as they struggle to make ends meet while wealth is literally transferred from the middle class to the wealthy .
Government officials stick to their claim that no significant inflation exists , even as certain necessary costs are skyrocketing and incomes are stagnating .
The transfer of wealth comes as savers and fixed - income families lose purchasing power , large banks benefit , and corporations receive plush contracts from the government — as is the case with military contractors .
These companies use the newly printed money before it circulates , while the middle class is forced to accept it at face value later on .
This becomes a huge hidden tax on the middle class , many of whom never object to government spending in hopes that the political promises will be fulfilled and they will receive some of the goodies .
But surprise — it does n’t happen .
The result instead is higher prices for prescription drugs , energy , and other necessities .
The freebies never come .
The moral of the story is that spending is always a tax .
The inflation tax , though hidden , only makes things worse .
Taxing , borrowing , and inflating to satisfy wealth transfers from the middle class to the rich in an effort to pay for profligate government spending , can never make a nation wealthier .
But it certainly can make it poorer .

This post goes into that age old category of ‘ learn something everyday ’ .
As regular readers of this blog know , I believe that we must do everything we can to both find alternative sources of energy and slow down the accelerating global warming trend .
One of the key ways to accomplish both of these is through technological innovation .
A while ago I read an article in the New York Times that was nothing less than thrilling regarding technology and global warming .
Six years ago the architect Richard Meier designed a church in Rome .
The dominant design element was curvilinear white concrete .
To preserve the whiteness the primary technical sponsor worked on coming up with a coating for the concrete .
Six years later , the coated concrete is as white as it was when constructed , while other parts of the building have grayed due to atmospheric pollution .
Now the thrilling part : the white pigment used actually ‘ eats ’ surrounding smog !
It was determined through testing that construction materials that contain titanium dioxide , the key ingredient in the pigment , destroy the pollutants found in car exhaust and heating emissions .
In other words , titanium dioxide breaks down the nitrogen oxides that are emitted by burning fossil fuels .
It is called photocatalytic cement .
The maker of the pigment , Italcementi , has conducted numerous tests that have determined that some pollutants could be reduced by 20 to 70 percent .
The reduction of pollutants is greatest within a distance of 8 feet .
In one test a 1,000 foot stretch of highway outside Milan , with a high level of vehicular traffic was paved with titanium dioxide and it was found that there was a 60 percent reduction of nitrogen oxides at street level .
This is not only a wonderful unintended consequence , it really is an innovative technological breakthrough of the highest order in our effort to cut down or emissions that lead to global warming .
Think about the concept of having the buildings and streets of cities treated with photocatalytic cement .
Everyone walking down the street would be less than eight feet from sideways , streets and buildings , so the pollution people would inhale would be dramatically reduced .
We could institutionalize through building codes that all concrete be coated with these materials and that regular reapplications would be mandatory .
Another positive aspect of this discovery is that one of the things that humanity has done that contributes to global warming is the vast paving of the land in the U.S. and around the world , since all this asphalt and concrete retains heat and prevents water absorption .
We can now take one of our more egregious assaults on the environment and negate it to some degree .
Make all our building materials act like trees !
It will take dozens , if not hundreds of such technological breakthroughs and their implementation to make substantial inroads in our effort to slow and ultimately reverse global warming .
We must look at everything we do regarding energy use and consistently find ways to change our behavior and correct damage done .
However , for each breakthrough we must celebrate a small victory .
Three cheers for titanium oxide !
I wrote several almost finished blog posts during ILC , but did n't get around to posting them " live " due to the issues with wireless access and a generic lack of time , due to being off having a jolly good time .
Then I did some more traveling after the ILC , and did n't manage to get them posted right afterward either .
And now that I 'm finally back home , most of what I wrote then no longer seems worth posting , since it 's lost the immediacy .
So here 's a few things that come to mind now .
The good
The organization was stellar in almost all respects .
A huge thanks to Nick Levine and anyone else who was involved .
Cambridge was just incredibly pretty , and the weather ranged from great to " not bad " .
There were some very good talks , though disappointingly most of the best ones were from Schemers :-)
The last day of talks was particularily good .
I had incredible fun meeting old friends , most of whom I had n't seen for a year , putting faces to names I knew from the net , and talking to completely new people .
Special honorable mentions in the latter category go to Jeremy Jones and Richard Brooksby , with whom I had several very interesting and fruitful discussions .
I also got lots of very valuable SBCL feedback and new ideas , for all kinds of things from the GC to the user interface for my code coverage tool for SBCL ( work in progress ) .
It looks as if we need to beef up the SBCL marketing department , though .
I had several discussions of the form " Q : What would it take to make SBCL do FOO ?
A : It 's already done that for the latest X releases . " .
In the worst case with the same person asking for three different features in succession , all of which had been implemented :-)
For example no - one seems to be aware that SBCL / Slime have stepper support .
Not horribly good stepper support , but support nonetheless .
Also got to talk shop with SBCL developers and Clozure / ITA people , which is always good .
And maybe even managed to offload some ideas that I 'd proof - of - concepted , but have no intention of ever properly implementing myself .
Got a surprisingly large number of congratulations on graduating .
And the guys had even got me a present ( a copy of the Lisp 1.5 manual that Nikodemus had found from a bookshop in Cambridge , MA ) .
Thanks !
Conveniently the title of the programming contest for the next ILC was pre-announced as " Lisp 1.5 " , so the manual might even be useful , not just cool :-)
I think the Ravenbrook guys are going to try integrating MPS with SBCL , since CMUCL did n't work out for them .
While it 's unlikely to replace the current SBCL GC for licensing reasons ( it 's currently under a GPLish license ) , it would be very interesting for two reasons : as a benchmark for the current GC and as a first step towards pluggable GCs .
The first one would be good since we know that the SBCL memory management is suboptimal in many ways .
It 'd be valuable to find out what the real cost of fixing many of those suboptimalities is .
As for pluggable GCs , Frode wrote a nice message to sbcl - devel about that .
If MPS is better for someone 's use case than SBCL 's gencgc and they can live with the license , it 'd certainly be nice for them to be able to just switch GCs .
And of course at some point implement other alternative GCs .
Compared to the ECLMs , surprisingly many people that I talked to were n't yet using Lisp seriously , but were just interested about it .
Some might think that this is bad , but I think it 's really great that there are people still in that stage who are interested enough to travel to and attend a multi-day Lisp conference .
And of course there were a lot more serious Lisp users than newbies .
Overall my ILC experience was very positive .
I 'll talk next about some bad stuff , but that 's just because I believe that you can't just sweep that stuff under the rug .
The bad
I think that program - wise there was maybe a day of talks that could 've been discarded with little loss .
Or if not a whole day , than at least enough to make the rest of the schedule less tight .
For example the History of Lisp presentation was total crap ( not just somewhat bad , but " I 'd rather listen to an hour of silence " - bad ) , and the information theory one had no business being presented in a Lisp conference .
Given what little I heard of the review process in other cases , I do n't understand how the latter ever got accepted .
I understand that people do n't really go to a conference for the talks , but that does n't mean that anything goes .
My plea to the next ILC program committee is threefold :
Please invite only speakers with something to say that 's relevant to Lisp now or in the future , not in the last millennium .
More specifically , I 'm sure there 's a temptation to " honor " the 50th birthday of Lisp by historical navel - gazing .
Please do n't give in to it .
If you do n't get enough good submissions , do n't accept the irrelevant ones as padding .
My attempts at industrial espionage were mostly a failure .
Both Duane and Jans ran out of time before getting around to stuff that would 've been both worth stealing .
For example Duane did n't have time to demo their profiler , which I 'd heard described as the gold standard of Lisp profilers , and of course I can't really try it out myself due to the license .
I was surprised that the Allegro equivalent to SBCL 's optimization notes did n't have any kind of UI for mapping the notes back to the original source , making it look mostly useless .
Or at least Duane , who is probably an expert at reading them , did get confused by the results a couple of times despite it being a scripted demo :-)
[ Which is n't to say that Franz 's presentations were bad .
I just did n't get much out of them SBCL - wise . ]
The controversial
Some stuff has received a lot of airtime after the conference .
Before the conference I expressed some puzzlement about there being an invited talk about CL - HTTP , which I regarded as a choice that was completely out of touch with the current state of the Lisp world .
Seeing the talk did n't change my opinion ( oh , wow , still using the White House information system from the Clinton administration as the example ? ) .
E.g. when Mallery asked about who had ever used CL - HTTP , and practically no hands went up , unlike with every other similar question that was asked during the conference .
But amazingly enough , in the last day two presentaters appeared to be seriously using CL - HTTP .
( IIRC they were the RacerPro and XMLisp ones ) .
Most of the Allegro features that Duane and Jans had time to show were things that SBCL already does in some form .
It 's just that they 're exporting their internals , and in some cases the interfaces do n't seem very polished .
I guess READ - LINE - INTO (? ) would n't be a bad addition , but e.g.
MEMCPY -UP and MEMCPY - DOWN were just completely wrong .
So I was n't horribly impressed with what they talked about .
But unlike Luke , who was stirring up the debate both at ILC and after , I think that it is a very worthwhile goal to give Lisp users access to low level facilities , and that we really should be suppling non-consing / resource - reusing versions of functions where possible .
STRING -TO - OCTETS and OCTETS -TO -STRING are an obvious example where SBCL could be improved .
Yes , it'd be really great to just cons indiscriminately , but no matter what the GC scheme is , there will be programs where consing will be deadly .
And yes , it 'll mean that code written for performance might be a bit ugly , but it 's still better than dropping to C from Python for performance , etc .
Of course SBCL users can use many of those low level facilities right now , but most of them are undocumented and unexported , which sets the bar for using them pretty high .
The end
Anyway , it was lots of fun !
I hope to see all of you again next year .
SALMON , Idaho ( Reuters ) - Public outrage prompted a temporary stay of execution on Wednesday for 300 bison , including an estimated 100 calves , roaming in Montana outside the confines of Yellowstone National Park .

The Montana Board of Livestock on Tuesday announced plans to capture and kill the bison , or buffalo , in the wake of news earlier this month that seven Montana cows had tested positive for brucellosis , a disease that can cause stillbirths in cows and infects some of the Yellowstone bison herd .
Bison advocates , including the Buffalo Field Campaign , launched an opposition campaign that caused an e-mail and telephone backlog at the state and federal agencies that manage Yellowstone ’s 3,900 bison .
“ We ’ve been getting the calls , ” said Christian Mackay , executive officer with the Montana Department of Livestock .
But “ capture and hauling to slaughter is by no means off the table . ”
The department said it would delay plans to round up and kill the bison until early next week .
The proposal comes as the tourist season is under way at Yellowstone , where bison draw hundreds of thousands of admirers .
Under a controversial state - federal agreement , bison that leave the protection of Yellowstone are subject to hazing and to slaughter .
The department had recently tried to encourage the wayward buffalo to return to the park .
While officials have yet to pinpoint the source of the brucellosis infection in the seven cows , and there is no documented case of brucellosis transmission from bison to cows in the wild , Montana ’s influential cattle industry is calling for a forced thinning of Yellowstone bison .
Cattle producers say the herd is an imminent threat to Montana ’s brucellosis - free status , which allows ranchers to ship cows across state lines without testing .
The state has a $ 1 billion livestock industry .
Animal activists say a historic prejudice against the buffalo , which were hunted and killed to near extinction by the late 19th century , continues to threaten the nation ’s last wild herd of purebred bison .
Plans to forcibly thin the Yellowstone herd comes even as the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service has proposed allowing hunters to kill more than half the bison in the National Elk Refuge in Wyoming -- reducing the herd from 1,100 to 500 animals -- because of overgrazing , concerns about brucellosis and federal budget cuts .
If you 're reading this post then you may have problems with procrastination .
I 've developed a list of things I can do when I 'm procrastinating .
The trick here is that even though I 'm still avoiding the work I 'm supposed to be doing , I 'm still engaged in doing something useful or meaningful .
Here 's my top 10 list .
I hope you find something of use .
1. Write a personal email or letter to someone
If there is a relationship you cherish or someone who means a lot to you , write them an email or letter telling them !
Take some time and strengthen your relationships .
2 . Start a collection of links that you can use to procrastinate more effectively later on
If you have a list of subjects you 're interested in learning more about , try starting a collection of links for each one .
The next time you 're busy procrastinating , pick on of those subjects and start visiting the links .
3 . Choose a subject you just " do n't get " and start doing research
For me , it was a programming language called Lisp .
I started doing lots of research into Lisp to learn more about it .
It 's turned out to be great because learning it has provided me with a sense of accomplishment .
I learned something new .
How great is that ?
4 . Write a stream of conciousness journal entry about the work you 're avoiding
Pull up Word , notepad , or a piece of pen and paper and just write about the work you 're avoiding .
If you 're avoiding the work because you 're stuck , chances are you 'll discover some angles that you had n't thought about .
It 's also a great way to think through the work you have to do without having to actually do it ( yet ) .
5. Practice speed reading
Go to reddit.com , digg.com or del.icio.us and start reading the articles posted there .
Focus on skimming the writing as quickly as you can .
Practice forming a picture of what the article or essay is about and then translate it into a concise paragraph summing up all the important points .
This technique helps me stay sharp .
6 . If you have ideas that would benefit the company you work for , write an email and send it
There 's no time like the present .
If there 's something that 's been bothering you or an opportunity you think would benefit the company , write your thoughts down and send them to someone who could help make it happen .
Ask for their input or reaction .
If anything , it 'll get it off your chest .
It 'll also help improve how people view you .
7. Initiate a conversation with someone and REALLY listen to what they are saying
I 'm a terrible listener .
Practice really focusing on what someone has to say even if the subject is completely uninteresting to you .
The intention here is to practice your " people skills " by listening and not talking .
8. Read over your latest " Sent Items " and try get a sense of how your writing represents your thinking
If you could rewrite an email you sent out , how would you rewrite it ?
Look for spelling errors , fuzziness of logic and try to see how you come across .
This is a great way to get a sense of how you communicate and a great way to improve it .
9 . Develop a list of your successes
Start a list of anything you succeeded at .
Try developing the list chronologically .
Is there a pattern ?
Is there something you can learn from ?
There usually is and developing a running list will help you see it .
10 . Develop a list of your failures
Develop a list of things you failed at .
Try to find the patterns .
Write about why you think you failed .
Write down what might have made you succeed .
The point is not to beat yourself up but to simply detach yourself from your failures and gain a better understanding of where you can be better .
Bonus :
Write a sincere thank you note
Is there someone who mentored you long ago ?
Is there someone who did something for you that you never truly thanked ?
Is there someone you admire that has written things or said things that have made an impact in your life ?
Take a few moments and write a sincere thank you .
It feels good to do it and it might inspire you to actually get back to work !

WIRED LEGENDS
Paul Baran conceived the Internet 's architecture at the height of the Cold War .
Forty years later , he says the Net 's biggest threat was n't the USSR - it was the phone company .
__ In 1961 , at the height of the Cold War , an engineer named Paul Baran sold the US Department of Defense on the idea of a failure - resistant communications method called packet switching .
But because of roadblocks at AT&T and the Pentagon , it was n't until the 1970s that the technology was finally adopted as the foundation architecture of the Arpanet - the precursor to the Internet .
In April , Baran ( pronounced " BEAR - en " ) will receive the Franklin Institute 's 2001 Bower Award and Prize for Achievement in Science , his latest in a string of prestigious honors from professional organizations including the Institute of Electrical and Electronic Engineers ( IEEE ) , the Association for Computing Machinery ( ACM ) , and NEC .
Over a lifetime of quietly sustained achievement as inventor and entrepreneur , Baran cofounded the Institute for the Future and created a series of successful companies - Cabledata Associates , Packet Technologies , Metricom , Interfax , and Com21 - based on technologies he developed .
As corporations like Cisco acquired his businesses , Baran 's inventions went mainstream :
His discrete multitone technology is at the heart of DSL , and his developments in spread spectrum transmission are essential to the ongoing wireless explosion .
Yet Baran is little known outside his field .
For this rare interview , I chatted with Baran in his meticulously tidy home office in Atherton , California .
Aside from the glint in his eye , there is nothing hackerish about Baran .
He comes across as a consummate professional : modest , formal , and , at 74 , as sharp and engaged as ever .
Baran is greatly concerned about getting the history of technology right .
He took the trouble to check over the transcript of our interview with details from documents published between 1959 and 1965 , a period when thousands of intercontinental ballistic missiles were poised to end civilization .
__
Wired :
The myth of the Arpanet - which still persists - is that it was developed to withstand nuclear strikes .
That 's wrong , is n't it ?
Paul Baran : Yes .
Bob Taylor1 had a couple of computer terminals speaking to different machines , and his idea was to have some way of having a terminal speak to any of them and have a network .
That 's really the origin of the Arpanet .
The method used to connect things together was an open issue for a time .
Which Taylor heard about not through you , but through Donald Davies2 originally ?
I have two different views on that .
I did n't pay much attention to it then , but with all the nonsense about it , I went back and started digging through the old records .
I do n't believe anything unless I can find it in writing , in contemporaneous documentation .
I had many , many discussions with the folks at Arpa , starting in the very early ' 60s .
The information about packet switching3 was not a surprise , not new .
People can listen to things and put them in the back of their mind .
So you do n't know .
People say they 'd never heard of me at the time , yet I 'd chaired a session with them in it .
It 's a beautiful exercise in the fallibility of leaky memories and why you want to build a library to last 10,000 years .
I 'm now a trustee of the IEEE History Center .
I think we 're underinvesting in recording history .
Look at the crazy economy we have right now , and all the growth and productivity - which we do not understand - with Alan Greenspan saying it 'll be 10 years before we know whether we have a different economy or it was just a bubble .
And we 're not even recording the key facts .
Lawyers are asking companies to destroy all records after three months , lest some sleazeball lawyer play games with discovery .
We 're in a period where key records are being destroyed very quickly , and some very important issues on what the hell is happening today we wo n't even be able to unravel .
I did n't know about Davies until he independently came up with the same idea .
He visited Rand4 while I was there , but he 's probably the only guy who did n't get a presentation on this .
I do n't know the reason - I probably was out of town .
He was an honest guy , and I 'm sure it was done independently .
But the origin of packet switching itself is very much Cold War .
The argument was :
To have a credible defense , you had to be able to withstand an attack and at least be able to show you had the capability to return the favor in kind .
Now whether it would ever be done or not , God hopes not .
But you had to be able to do that , and that was a limitation on the second - strike capability .
1 Robert W. Taylor ( b. 1932 ) Former deputy director of the Information Processing Techniques Office of the Advanced Research Projects Agency ( now Darpa ) , who in 1966 proposed a network to connect research computers at different sites across the US .
2 Donald Davies ( 1924-2000 )
Researcher at the British National Physical Laboratory credited with creating packet switching architecture in 1965 , coining the term , and presenting the idea in 1967 to USresearchers who successfully proposed it as the data transfer model for the Arpanet .
3 Packet switching
The rapid transmission of small blocks of data over a channel dedicated to the connection only for the duration of one packet 's transmission .
Each packet can take a different path from sender to receiver .
By contrast , most telephone systems still use a circuit switching model , in which all data travels along a continuous dedicated path between the sender and receiver .
4 Rand Corporation
A nonprofit institution founded after World War II to guide public policy through the research and analysis of issues from national defense to criminal justice .
The name is short for " research and development . "
The second - strike capability was under discussion , and you were involved in that when ?
I did this stuff at Rand around 1960 .
I had joined Rand in ' 59 .
But beware of anybody whose history of the subject starts the day they entered the field .
You always build on previous work .
As I understood the issue then , it was to be able to get the signal of " go " or " no - go " out to the missiles .
But you had already worked on the Minuteman5 intercontinental missile .
Yes , this was back at Hughes . 6
That was ' 55 to '59 .
In 1955 you were 29 , and you were an engineer - working on what ?
I joined Hughes to work with the Systems Group on what we called the Vest Pocket SAGE .7
You know , the SAGE system was a big , big monstrous thing .
Then transistors arrived , making it possible to build the whole thing inside a van .
That 's what Hughes was doing .
They did the first one for the Army and the second one for the Navy .
It became the Navy 's tactical data system .
This was all missile detection ?
No , this was for airplane detection .
The very early missiles took all day to fuel up , so you had warning time to do something .
But when missiles went from liquid fuel to solid - state , 8 the danger increased tremendously .
When did the solid - state missiles come in ?
It depends on which stage .
The first discussions were early ' 50s .
They actually did n't come out till a couple years later .
When Kennedy ran for office in 1960 , he made an issue of this missile gap - which , after the fact , turned out to be bullshit .
Do we know if he knew it was bullshit ?
I think so .
It was very closely held , but I think Eisenhower gave him briefings .
So he could pretend it was a problem and the administration could n't really deny it without blowing what it did know .
That 's right .
But I did n't learn about this till much later .
Back then I was going under the assumption that there really was a missile gap .
The real proof of what was happening came later in the early ' 60s , when U - 2 spy planes brought back information that they could n't find the Soviet missile sites .
Anyway , I was over at Hughes in the late ' 50s .
They were bidding on a contract for the design of the Minuteman control system .
I was scared shitless , because you had all these missiles that could go off by anyone 's stupidity .
The technology was never to be trusted .
Were your coworkers similarly worried ?
Absolutely .
We knew it was the most dangerous thing ever put together .
The people who were working on these problems at the time were all scared stiff of what might happen if we did nothing .
It 's about as nasty a problem as has ever confronted the world .
We thought , What can we do to reduce its likelihood ?
In all my time at Rand and dealing with the DOD , I never heard anyone ever express any desire whatsoever for thermonuclear war , knowing how destructive it would be for all civilization .
I dug up my old Rand bomb damage calculator9 as a reminder of those times .
Notice that this device , which provides the magnitude of the damage anticipated in a nuclear strike , is unclassified .
Those who understand how wars are started , and the scale of the destructive force of nuclear weapons in reality , hold views totally opposite to scientists portrayed in Dr. Strangelove .
I got very interested in the subject of how the hell you build a reliable command and control system .
And they said , " Go ahead , kid , " or what ?
No single person ever does anything .
It 's always groups of people .
We wanted to know how to go about building such a system .
So I got interested in the subject of neural nets .
Warren McCulloch10 in particular inspired me .
He described how he could excise a part of the brain , and the function in that part would move over to another part .
As we get older - at least this was thought in those days - the number of brain cells decreases but we 're able to use the surviving functionality effectively .
As you and I are getting older , we know it takes a little time to remember a word - so we find a synonym .
We have more trouble with proper nouns because there 's lower redundancy .
McCulloch 's version of the brain had the characteristics I felt would be important in designing a really reliable communication system .
As I worked on the communication problem , I felt that I could do better at Rand .
They had more freedom than at Hughes .
5 Minuteman
The US 's mainstay intercontinental ballistic missile , this solid - state model was first deployed in 1962 .
The proposed National Missile Defense ( NMD ) program would be based on retrofitted Minuteman III missiles , which are scheduled to remain in service until 2020 .
6 Hughes Aircraft Defense contracting giant founded by Howard Hughes in 1932 and acquired by General Motors in 1987 .
7 SAGE
The world 's largest computer in 1958 , Semi-Automatic Ground Environment was faster than human operators at monitoring radar blips to watch for attacking Soviet supersonic bombers .
8 Solid - state rocket A rocket that stores propellant inside the engine as a rubberlike substance , to allow a quick launch .
9 Bomb Damage Effect Computer Rand 's 1958 calculator for estimating the impact of a nuclear blast .
10 Warren McCulloch ( 1898 - 1969 )
Neurobiologist whose 1943 paper with statistician Walter Pitts explored the concept of neural networks .
Give me a little picture of Rand .
There are whole books about Xerox PARC , but I have n't seen much on Rand .
Was it brilliant leadership , a brilliant system ?
What made it work ?
All of the above .
Great leadership , great researchers , and great freedom to be effective .
Its first president , who served for many years , was Frank Collbohm , a former test pilot .
Frank was a very smart and understated man who went to great lengths to avoid taking any limelight away from the staff .
As an example of the policies , the only person allowed to deliver a presentation was the researcher who actually did the work .
The original building was two stories and had courtyards .
It was designed by a mathematician , John Williams , who figured out the greatest chance of taking different paths to get from point A to point B , so you had more random encounters with other people .
It worked .
It 's very difficult to get people with such different skills - physics , social sciences - to connect .
But Rand was the most productive damned place I 've ever seen .
So there you were at Rand - it's ' 59 , '60 - and you were interested in command and control for ...?
I was just interested in the general subject of command and control and some of the issues .
I had some very , very crude insights .
Then a request came in on the issue of command and control communications for survivability .
I said , " Hey , that 's something I 'd like to work on . "
The first thing I did was make sure the stuff we did at Hughes got written up .
That 's the freedom you had at the place .
Rand allowed it to a great degree .
We do n't have enough trust inside the government today to allow such things .
There was another crazy thing that occurred at Rand .
Somebody was doing a study on termination of wars .
How the hell do wars stop ?
Interesting problem , but Congress got all pissed at the idea .
They even passed a law forbidding government - funded defense researchers from studying surrender .
They were afraid that somebody would think our study of surrender would indicate that we were exhibiting weakness .
So the study of surrender continued , but you did n't call it that .
We did n't emphasize that communications was important in cooling things off ; we did emphasize getting the word around to go fire your missiles .
Sometimes certain terms take on a meaning of their own and become real .
One was " minimum essential communications . "
The military said all they wanted was " minimum essential communications , " and I believed them .
So I thought data rate would take care of everything - get the word out , calm things down if necessary .
You do n't need a hell of a lot of communication for that .
So then I picked up on an idea from Frank Collbohm that the problem is the military depends heavily on high - frequency communications .
A high - altitude nuclear burst takes out the ionosphere11 for many hours .
So the only thing that was left was the ground wave 12 - that 's what you get from broadcast stations during the day in the short range .
Collbohm 's idea was for the radio stations to relay the message from one to the other .
But there are a lot of them in the US .
So I said , " Let 's automate it . "
That would make it practical .
The first crack that I took at it in 1960 , I got an old Johniac computer and a plotting board , and I plotted the locations of all the AM13 radio stations in the US .
Yeah , there 's plenty of paths ; I said look at the range .
That went off in two directions .
One , I went out with a briefing chart , saying , " OK , here 's the solution to your problem . "
I got push - back from the military : " That takes care of the president getting word to the missile , but what about me ?
I 've got to speak to the troops .
I 've got to do this and that .
I need more communication . "
Meanwhile , the Air Force took the idea and gave it to Rome Air Development Center .
They built it as a teletypewriter system and tested it .
It worked just fine .
And they did something cute :
They used the AM radio stations , but slightly wobulated their frequency - around 20 Hz .
You could n't hear it on your radio , but it let us send a frequency - modulated 14 teletype signal .
Was that implemented ?
Yeah .
It was implemented , tested with a dozen stations , and it all worked fine .
That may have been the first packet - switching system .
Let me see if I actually understand this .
These were AM stations .
And this system is doing frequency modulation on that , so it 's turning these AM stations into secret FM stations for teletype messages of " go " and " no - go " on missiles .
That 's diabolical .
That 's pretty good .
I did n't invent that .
Whoever it was at Rome did that .
Did the AM stations know this was going on ?
I did n't get involved with it , but I saw a piece in an amateur radio magazine where somebody said that it was a hush - hush program at the time .
It 's sort of wild .
Here are radio stations , who are the ultimate blabbermouths , and you use them as your channel of extremely secret , extremely important communication .
Really , the issue was , Why do n't we use the telephone system ?
AT&T was a total monopoly at the time .
And totally in bed with the Defense Department ?
There were whispered stories about that , but I think their own interests and their own perception got the best of them ; we 'll get back to that .
But if you had an attack - and not very many missiles - aimed at our strategic forces , it would take out the telephone system without even aiming for it .
Collateral damage was the name for it , a frightening thing .
That analysis was done at Rand .
AT&T would n't give us the maps , so we got them through the back door .
That 's shocking , that they would n't give you the maps .
They did n't want to expose their vulnerability .
To the enemy .
I see .
The definition of enemy is still open .
That 's the famous problem of secrecy .
How do you solve a problem if you can't admit that you have it ?
The problem was that the telephone system was centralized .
You had a hierarchical switching system .
It was a five - level hierarchy .
You had switching centers .
It was all analog transmission in those days , and you could n't go through more than five links before the quality was unacceptable .
So you had the realization that the phone system could n't be trusted .
And the fallback , which was high - frequency radio , could n't be trusted in a nuclear environment .
So a distributed network of ground - wave transmission was one direction of solution .
I tried to figure out how much communications we needed and went around to different command centers and asked them what they needed .
You could just pick up and go and do all these things .
Now there would be a lot of red tape .
Back then Rand had a blanket " need to know , " so I had no problem on that .
I figured there was no limit on the amount of communications that people thought they needed .
So I figured I 'd give them so much communications they would n't know what the hell to do with it .
Then that became the work - to build something with sufficient bandwidth so that there 'd be no shortage of communications .
The question was , how the hell do you build a network of very high bandwidth for the future ?
The first realization was that it had to be digital , because we could n't go through the limited number of analog links .
11 Ionosphere Region of the atmosphere ( 30 to 250 miles above the surface ) where ionization caused by incoming solar radiation refracts high - frequency radio waves .
Signals bouncing from sky to Earth and back again can travel great distances , following the planet 's curvature .
12 Ground wave A low - frequency radio wave that travels along Earth , following its curvature instead of reflecting off the ionosphere .
13 Amplitude modulation A method of radio transmission in which sound is encoded by varying the strength of the broadcast signal .
14 Frequency modulation A method of radio transmission in which sound is encoded by varying the wavelength of the broadcast signal .
How obvious was that in 1960 ?
In 1960 , I did some interesting studies on redundancy and we simulated it at Rand .
We built a network like a fishnet , with different degrees of redundancy .
A net with the minimum number of wires to connect all the nodes together , we called 1 .
If it was crisscrossed with twice as many wires , that was redundancy level 2 .
Then 3 and 4 .
Then we threw an attack against it , a random attack .
A very interesting thing happened .
You can build very , very tough networks - by tough I mean a high probability of being able to communicate if the two end nodes survive - if you had a redundancy level of about 3 .
The enemy could destroy 50 , 60 , 70 percent of the targets or more and it would still work .
It 's very robust .
That was the thing that struck me .
But it was necessary to build it digitally .
Analog could not repeat the signal well enough .
With digital you clean up the message , so you can go through a lot of repeaters , and you reconstruct the same signal .
Analog is like making a videotape of a videotape of a videotape :
The quality goes to pot .
We had to go through a lot of different connections , so the only way we could do it would be digital .
The phone system was analog then .
In 1960 , was anything digital ?
Nothing .
AT&T was doing some work on pulse code modulation15 for what became the T1 , but it was only designed for short distance , and that work went to their Bell Labs division .
AT&T and Bell Labs were really two different places .
The digital folks at Bell Labs understood what I was doing and were very positive and favorably inclined .
It was AT&T headquarters , with the old analog people , that missed it .
If a guy knew only analog , he could not comprehend what I was saying about the behavior of a digital circuit .
If you were going to build a network with redundancy , that tells you right there how many paths you need .
There 's no choice .
At the same time , you do n't have to use high - priced stuff anymore .
Because in the analog days both ends of the connection had to work in tandem , and the probability of many things working in tandem without failing was so low that you had to make every part nearly perfect .
But if you do n't care about reliability any more , then the cost of the components goes way down .
You were trying to build a reliable system with unreliable components ?
Exactly .
That 's the key .
It 's a profound concept .
One imagines it 's the other way , that even with reliable components you 'll probably get an unreliable system , and here you 're saying , " No , actually , with unreliable components ... "
You can get any reliability you want - far , far greater than the reliability of the components .
The thing I found intriguing is it did not take a lot of redundancy to do it .
Just a moderate degree of redundancy , properly used , gave me this big payoff in reliability .
Was there error - checking and error - correction in this system ?
That came next .
One of the characteristics I laid down for myself was that we also wanted to do voice .
Everything would get converted to digital : Teletype , data , and voice .
If you do voice , that gives you some restrictions on minimum data rates and how long you can afford to be at any switching node , where you look at the message and pass it on .
So we said , " Let 's have a half - second delay maximum from one point to another . "
Then at every one of these nodes we would keep a carbon copy of the message until we 're sure it got through intact to the next node .
It was easy to spot errors , but correcting errors was difficult .
So the carbon copy with error detection allowed repeated transmission of any message block , now called a packet .
A packet was a standardized block of data - it had to say who it was going to , who it came from , and how long it was in the network .
Saying a network is digital does not automatically mean it 's packetized .
Oh , no .
Not at all .
There 's a major distinction to keep in mind between message switching16 and packet switching .
Donald Davies later said that he picked the name packet switching intentionally to separate it from message switching .
Anyway , you send the packet out , and when this station gets it off to the next guy , it sends back , " OK , got it .
You can erase the previous one . "
If the first station does n't hear back , it sends another copy out in a different direction .
The packets can arrive out of order .
We just sort them out at the end .
Since it did n't have to be synchronous , you did n't have to lock everything all together .
It did n't take very long before we started seeing all sorts of wonderful properties in this model .
The network would learn where everybody was .
You could chop up the network and within half a second of real - world time it would be routing traffic again .
Then we had the realization that if there 's an overload in one place , traffic will move around it .
So it 's a lot more efficient than conventional communications .
If somebody tries to hog the network , the traffic routes away from them .
Packet switching had all these wonderful properties that were n't invented - they were discovered .
15 Pulse code modulation
The most commonly used method for encoding digital audio onto a signal .
16 Message switching Better known as " store and forward , " a communications model that 's somewhere between circuit switching and packet switching .
A complete message is received before it 's passed on to the next node .
Did you have a lot of breakthroughs , as opposed to just grinding away at the problem ?
Yeah , epiphanies .
I had a whole string of them .
I say they 're mostly discoveries rather than inventions .
Like the realization that by breaking the physical address from the logical address , 17 you could move around the network and your address would follow you .
There were about a dozen things like that .
I 'm sure there must 've been a zillion false leads , but we filtered them out .
What it sounds like is you 're getting these mutually self - reinforcing realizations that not only is this good , but that 's good , and then they make each other double good , and on and on .
That 's right .
You say , " My God , one day this is how we 're going to build all our networks . "
It 's such a wild thought that you ask , " Am I fooling myself ? "
I took out the briefing charts and went around to present this idea ... and got dumped all over .
People said it would n't work because of this reason or that reason .
I would study the problem and come back .
A good wire - brushing like this was necessary .
You see , these ideas were crazy .
We were in an analog world .
The image of a computer was a great big room with parts failing all the time .
I said , " You can build computers in shoe box size .
It 's already happening on board airplanes . "
Do you make any attempts to demo any of this ?
No .
Rand jokingly referred to itself as standing for " research and no development . "
I 've since learned that it 's a hell of a lot easier to just build something than to try to convince somebody who does n't believe it 's possible .
So , it was n't a demo environment there .
No .
Hey , this was not our business .
We wanted the telephone company to do it .
[ Cackles ruefully . ]
The Air Force said to AT&T , " Look , we 'll give you the money .
Just do it . "
AT&T replied , " It 's not going to work .
And furthermore , we 're not going into competition with ourselves . "
How seriously did AT&T look at the proposal ?
The response was most interesting .
The story I tell is of the time I went over to AT&T headquarters - one of many , many times - and there 's a group of old graybeards .
I start describing how this works .
One stops me and says , " Wait a minute , son .
Are you trying to tell us that you open the switch up in the middle of the conversation ? "
I say , " Yes . "
His eyeballs roll as he looks at his associates and shakes his head .
We just were n't on the same wavelength .
If you think in analog terms , the signal arrives instantaneously .
If you think in digital terms , time moves very , very slowly , and you can do things like change the path while you 're in the middle of a syllable .
But it was a mental block .
They did n't understand digital .
It was mostly generational , but there were young analog guys who had the same problem .
If a guy considered the model of transmission to be analog , transmission time was instantaneous .
It was a hang - up that caused people to think I was bullshitting them or did n't know what I was talking about .
But could n't they find out if you knew what you were talking about pretty quickly ?
They said , " Oh , the people at Bell Labs are not practical .
They do n't understand telephony . "
That was the sort of response I always got .
It was , if you 'll pardon the expression , a paradigm switch .
It was very hard for them to believe something like packet switching could be done .
In retrospect , it looks like AT&T not only behaved badly in terms of blinding themselves to what could be significant innovation , they also behaved stupidly in setting their company on a path of aversion to the world that was going to replace them .
And Bell Labs , which should 've been used as a way to prevent them from making that kind of mistake , was n't .
Bell Labs really did try to change things .
Ihad set up a meeting with Ed David , the executive director of Bell Labs , and his equivalent , the chief engineer of the telephone company , at Ed David 's house .
I 'd explain something to Ed , who was a digital type and understood it .
He 'd turn around and explain it to the AT&T man , almost in Western Electric 18 part numbers .
Then the analog guy would say something in Western Electric part numbers , and David would translate it to me .
It was an attempt - a strong attempt - to try to cross that bridge , that somewhat intellectual , somewhat emotional bridge .
They 're the people who could 've and should 've done it .
But the company was controlled by people who had been there a long time , and they were all analog .
They were n't even switching people .
So the Air Force wanted to build a digital packet - switching network , but AT&T refused .
What happened next ?
Rand , in 1965 , issued a formal recommendation to the Air Force to proceed without AT&T .
The Air Force set up a committee to check it out .
They concluded yes , it would work , it was technically feasible .
They felt the cost would be a little bit higher , but not significantly higher .
The costs were a drop in the bucket to what we were already spending .
The system could pay for itself in no time .
Everything was going smoothly until the Department of Defense said , " Oops .
Under the Defense Reorganization Act of 1949 , this activity belongs with the Defense Communications Agency . "
A little history on the DCA : Each of the services was highly competitive , and each was building its own communications system .
I was in the Army .
So you know who the enemy was - it was the other services .
To overcome the competition and duplication among them , the Department of Defense pulled the communications functions out of the individual services and put them in a single new agency , the Defense Communications Agency .
All the services were building their own message switching systems : electronic versions of the torn - tape teletype systems .
The committee went around and said , " We ca n't afford all this crap . "
The family units could n't even speak to one another , so we did n't get any redundancy out of it .
Their recommendation was to pick one and shoot the rest , amid the screams .
But at the time , DCA was still old analog people .
I 'd worked with them in ' 61 and ' 62 .
I realized that if DCA tried to build the system , it would n't work .
It would be an utter waste of taxpayer money .
Around early ' 66 , I said , " Oops , tilt ! " I spoke to my friend Frank Eldridge , who had worked at Rand and was working on command and control survivability before I got there .
We were very close and he was a very strong supporter .
I said , " Frank , it ai n't gonna work . "
So the funds for it got clipped .

The logical address does correspond to a physical address , but it can be remapped from one physical address to another , as necessary .
18 Western Electric Exclusive equipment manufacturer for Bell Telephone from 1882 through the monopoly 's breakup in 1984 .
You were actually powerful enough at this point to pull the plug on it ?
I pulled the plug on the whole baby .
There was no point .
I said , " Just wait until some competent agency comes around .
Because if DCA gets the task , it ain't gonna work , and for the next 10 years , people will say , ' We tried that , but it did n't work . ' "
Let 's put this in the Cold War context :
The idea was to have basically retaliatory capabilities , so you would n't have to use them .
But that only works if the other guy knows about it .
What was going on in terms of visibility ?
Were you sending your papers to the Soviet Union ?
We kept everything open that we could .
And trailed it in front of known spies ?
We published it !
I gave a course on it at the University of Michigan in ' 65 .
We were a hell of a lot better off if the Soviets had a better command and control system .
Their command and control system was even worse than ours .
That sounds pretty enlightened .
This was the Air Force saying , " We want the enemy to have the same second - strike capability as we do . "
There 's certain things you do n't say .
But yes .
What level did that enlightenment come from ?
I think it went throughout .
Those guys were n't dumb .
The president knew , the Secretary of the Air Force knew ?
All these people thought , " This is not a secret we want to keep " ?
It did n't ever get up to that level , I do n't think , but it permeated the question of " Do we keep it secret or not ? "
Right from the beginning , the answer was no .
At Rand we had secret documents , but the secret documents pertained to vulnerabilities and specific things like that .
Some issues in crypto .
But our whole plan , the concept of packet switching and all the details , was wide open .
Not only did Rand publish it , they sent it to all the repository laboratories around the world .
Since the Soviets were presumably able to know about what you were proposing , is it possible they were developing good command and control for a second - strike capability ?
I do n't know what was going on there at the time .
But they did n't have the digital technology .
They were so far behind .
Yet they could believe that we had second - strike capability because of this ?
Yeah .
Their approach would be different .
Still , in ' 66 it was no - go .
You had shut down the plan with the Defense Communications Agency .
Were you disappointed ?
No .
The military pressure for it was diminished .
The ideas had gotten out .
So , a back burner for packet switching .
You worked on other things , presumably ?
Yeah , I was working on computer privacy .
I was the first guy to testify to Congress on the problem .
That and a lot of other things .
Do you ever wish you owned a patent on packet switching ?
No .
First of all , 17 years went by very quickly .
Secondly , it would 've gotten in the way of people using it .
That was one of the objectives : to broaden the access .
What 's your sense of when you first thought that this thing you were working on was going to take over the world ?
Around December ' 66 , I presented a paper at the American Marketing Association called " Marketing in the Year 2000 . "
I did n't talk about packet switching , but I described push - and - pull communications and how we 're going to do our shopping via a television set and a virtual department store .
If you want to buy a drill , you click on Hardware and that shows Tools and you click on that and go deeper .
In the end , if you have two drills you 're interested in , then you hit your Consumers Union button , and their evaluation goes up on the screen .
Pretty much what WebTV is .
Some in the audience were furious .
They said , " People do n't go shopping to buy things .
They go there because of the enjoyment .
You do n't understand women . "
I could see a few people going for it , but most of them were shaking their heads .
In 1966 you were foreseeing the way networks would be distributed , and you were starting to see applications .
What stuff that emerged from ' 66 to the present surprised you ?
Playing with the Arpanet as a user , fairly early on .
The number of users was very small , but the rate of increase made it obvious what was going to happen .
It was just a matter of time .
No one is ever as shocked and surprised as when the inevitable occurs .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Attorney General Alberto Gonzales received a subpoena on Tuesday from a U.S. congressional panel for documents related to the firing of federal prosecutors , a controversy that has prompted calls for his resignation .
Attorney General Alberto Gonzales listens to a question during a news conference at the Justice Department in Washington , March 13 , 2007 .
REUTERS
“ I look forward to your timely compliance so that we can proceed with getting to the truth , ” Democratic Rep. John Conyers of Michigan , chairman of the House Judiciary Committee , wrote in a letter to Gonzales that accompanied the subpoena .
The White House said President George W. Bush had asked the Justice Department to be “ fully responsive ” to the request , and a spokesman said the department was hoping to reach an accommodation with Congress .
The House of Representatives and the Senate are investigating the Bush administration ’s dismissal last year of the eight U.S. attorneys .
While the administration has insisted the firings were justified , Republican and Democratic critics question if the dismissals were politically motivated .
Gonzales , who with Bush ’s public support has rejected calls to resign , is to appear next week before the Senate Judiciary Committee , which plans to authorize subpoenas of its own on Thursday for administration documents .
At the White House , spokeswoman Dana Perino said , “ President Bush asked the Department of Justice to be fully responsive to this specific request from Congress ” and added the department has already provided more than 3,000 pages of documents .
Asked whether Bush continued to have confidence in Gonzales , Perino replied : “ Of course the president still has confidence in the attorney general . ”
Justice Department spokesman Brian Roehrkasse said much of the information sought by Congress involved individuals other than the fired prosecutors .
“ Because there are individual privacy interests implicated by publicly releasing this information , it is unfortunate the Congress would choose this option , ” he said .
“ We still hope and expect that we will be able to reach an accommodation with the Congress . ”

Huahua and the Little Chick In China a pet chihuahua named Huahua adopted a baby chick .
Huahua took charge of the chick as soon as owner Liu Bangyang ’s daughter brought it home .
She regards the chick as her baby and stands guard to make sure it comes to no harm .
Whenever the chick strays too far , Huahua picks it up gently in her mouth and puts it back in its cot .
Liu , from Guiyang city , said : “ We ’ll try our best to raise the little chicken , if that ’s what Huahua wants ” .
And how about what the little chick wants ?
Because I ’m imagining pretty high on that list is going to be “ not being in a dog ’s mouth ” .

Sai Mai and the Piglets
For a couple of years now a set of adorable pictures of a tiger playing with a litter of little piglets have been circulating the internet .
The story accompanying the photographs is always different .
Sometimes it is a tigress who lost her cubs and adopted the piglets , sometimes it is the piglets who lost their mother .
Unfortunately the true background is a little more sinister .
The images were taken in 2004 at the Sriracha Tiger Zoo in Chonburi , Thailand .
Although the Sriracha Tiger Zoo hosts one of the world ’s most successful tiger breeding programs , unlike most western zoos it also offers circus and carnival - like shows , exhibits , and interactions , including the mixture of adults and young of different species in the same enclosures .
The mixture of tiger and piglets depicted in the images was not something undertaken for functional reasons , but rather as a form of visual entertainment provided by the zoo for the amusement of its visitors .
Not cool Sriracha Tiger Zoo !

Cassie the Cat and Moe the Crow Cassie was an abandoned kitten , tossed into the yard of Anne and Wally in Attleboro , Massachusetts .
Almost immediately Cassie was adopted by a wild crow later named Moses .
Anne says , “ She trusted no one but the bird .
When Cassie went in the road , Moses would do everything she knew to get him out of the road . ”
Moses also went so far as to hand ( err , beak ) feed Cassie food she found on the ground .

Chino and Falstaff Chino is a 9 - year - old Golden Retriever with fuzzy paws , and Falstaff is a 15 - inch orange and black koi who likes to nibble on fuzzy paws .
The two have been fast friends for three years now , according to Mary and Dan Heath of Medford , Oregon .
When Chino lies down with his nose an inch from the water , Falstaff eagerly swims up to the dog , sometimes playfully nibbling on the pooch ’s paws .
Ms. Heath describes how their pooch reacted to the small pond in the back yard of their new house : “ Chino just got real fascinated .
He would lie there on the rocks and just watch the fish .
This is one of the few things that ’ll get him to wag his tail . ”

The Snake and the Snack Hamster ( Aochan and Gohan ) A rodent - eating snake and a hamster have developed an unusual bond at a zoo in Tokyo , Japan .
Their relationship began when zookeepers presented the hamster to the snake as a meal .
However , the rat snake ( named Aochan ) refused to eat the rodent .
The two now share a cage , and the hamster sometimes falls asleep sitting on top of his natural foe .
Zookeepers have since named the hamster ‘ Gohan ’ – the Japanese word for meal .

XCOR 's methane rocket successfully passing a test in the Mojave Desert .
The technology could make planets and moons into space - based refueling stations .
Engineers have successfully tested a rocket powered by methane -- the first of its kind for spaceflight .
Future generations of the new engine could use Mars , Jupiter , Saturn 's moon Titan and other planets and moons as celestial refueling stations , allowing for lighter spacecraft and easier lift - offs from Earth .
A dramatic video shows the rocket 's blue flames streaking into the desert , blowing up clouds of dust and sand .
Built by XCOR Aerospace , the test rocket packs 7,500 pounds of thrust -- just a fraction of the space shuttle 's solid rocket boosters at 3,300,000 pounds of thrust each -- but its designers are just getting started .
The Mojave Desert test will provide testing grounds for the design of a much - larger , space - faring rocket .
Today 's space rockets use liquid oxygen and hydrogen or solid fuels , which are hard to collect , tricky to store and very expensive .
Methane , however , need not be stored at - 253 degree Celsius temperatures as hydrogen must be .
It 's also denser than hydrogen , making more out of limited space in fuel containers .
Methane has another bonus : " You do n't have to put on a HAZMAT suit to handle it like fuels used on many space vehicles , said Terri Tramel , NASA 's project manager for the rocket .
Collecting methane on other planets and moons would be tricky , but not impossible .
Robotic probes could gather the stuff from Saturn 's moon Titan , which harbors lakes and rivers of liquid methane .
Although Mars has much less methane , it could be produced by heating carbon dioxide and hydrogen together .
One caveat to methane is that it 's difficult to ignite , unlike highly reactive oxygen and hydrogen .
But rocket engineers are hopeful .
" Methane has so many advantages , " Tramel said .
" The question is , why have n't we done this before ? "
A Few Combinators : swap , dup , zap , unit , cat , cons , i , dip
[ B ] [ A ] swap == [ A ] [ B ] [ A ] dup == [ A ] [ A ] [ A ] zap ==
" swap " simply swaps the top two items on the stack , reversing their order .
" dup " just duplicates the top item , leaving a copy .
" zap " erases the top item .
Later it will be seen that " swap " , " dup " , " zap " have a special relation to the classic " C " , " W " , and " K " combinators , respectively .
Next , take a look at the combinators " cat " , " cons " , and " unit " :
[ B ] [ A ] cat == [ B A ] [ B ] [ A ] cons == [ [ B ]
A ] [ A ] unit == [ [ A ] ]
These combinators are special in that they restructure quotations .
" cat " takes two quotations and concatenates them together .
" cons " does the same , except that the bottom parameter is kept separately quoted inside the result ; another way of thinking of " cons " is that it takes a program " A " , and gives back what is still essentially the program " A " , except that a parameter has been hardwired into it ( later , it will be seen that " cons " has a special relation to the classic " B " combinator ) .
" unit " takes a program " A " and leaves a program that , when executed , leaves the program " A " on the stack ; also , you could think of " unit " as simply wrapping a quotation in a second layer .
Finally , take a look at the combinators " i " and " dip " :
[ A ] i == A [ B ] [ A ] dip == A [ B ]
These combinators are special in that they dequote stack items , removing their wrapping ; in other words , these combinators execute programs on the stack .
The " i " combinator simply executes the top item on the stack .
The " dip " combinator executes the top item " A " , but first it gets rid of the second item , which is restored after the execution of " A " is complete .
The " dip " combinator will prove to be very versatile and also quite fundamental .
Interconstructability of Combinators
To give an idea of how constructions can happen , it should be pointed out that the eight combinators above are not independent ; many of them can be defined in terms of each other .
For example , take a look at the three combinators " cat " , " cons " , and " unit " ( these are the ones which had a restructuring effect ) .
It is possible to construct " cat " and " unit " in terms of " cons " :
cat == [ [ i ] dip i ] cons cons unit == [ ] cons
This construction of " unit " is quite simple and elegant .
Notice that it employs the empty quotation " [ ] " ; an empty quotation is in principle just like any other quotation , except that its body is empty .
In constructing simpler combinators in terms of more complex ones ( as we are here with " unit " in terms of " cons " ) , we will often find " [ ] " to be useful .
The construction of " cat " above needs a bit of comment .
Essentially , " [ i ] dip i " is a program that runs the top two programs , in turn ; the bottom one is run first with " [ i ] dip " , and then the top is run with " i " .
Of course , " [ i ] dip i " itself is not a valid construction of " cat " , since " cat " should not run the top two programs , but should instead leave a program on the stack that would run those two programs .
This is where " cons " comes in .
In all , this is how the construction works :
[ B ] [ A ] [ [ i ] dip i ] cons cons == [ B ] [ [ A ] [ i ] dip i ] cons == [ [ B ] [ A ] [ i ] dip i ] == [ [ B ] i [ A ] i ] == [ B A ]
This construction has a bit of a caveat , which should be pointed out : in order for this construction to work out , we had apply rewrite rules inside of a quotation .
If a particular formalism considers this to be valid , then we say that it has transparent quotation , whereas if this is not valid , then it has opaque quotation .
The standard Joy interpreter actually has opaque quotation in that " [ [ B ] [ A ] [ i ] dip i ] " is considered distinct from " [ B A ] " , even though both quotations would do the same thing when executed ( they are distinct because , for example , " size " would give " 5 " in the first case and perhaps " 2 " in the second ) .
However , even though the two above quotations can be distinguished , in many contexts they would be considered interchangable .
So , we just showed how " cons " could be used to construct " unit " and " cat " .
However , the reverse is also possible :
cons == [ unit ] dip cat
This constructs " cons " as basically " cat " , except that the bottom parameter is wrapped up first by " unit " ( the " dip " is used so that the " unit " applies to the bottom parameter rather than the top one ) .
Now , moving on to another construction , notice that " dip " and " swap " are quite similar , in a way ; the only difference is that " dip " executes the top program , whereas " swap " leaves it quoted .
This suggests the construction of swap :
swap == unit dip
It is also possible to construct " dip " in terms of " swap " :
dip == swap unit cat i
It works like this :
[ B ] [ A ] swap unit cat i == [ A ] [ B ] unit cat i == [ A ] [ [ B ] ] cat i == [ A [ B ] ] i == A [ B ]
Thus , " swap unit cat i " , given two stack items , does the same thing that " dip " does with them .
Finally , we 'll give a curious way in which " i " can be constructed from " dip " :
i == dup dip zap
Here we are again constructing a simple primitive using more complex ones ; usually this type of construction is considered unelegant , and this one is particularly bad in it relies on making an unnecessary copy ( i.e. , " dup " is used to make a copy that is subsequently thrown away , unused , by " zap " ) .
The construction can perhaps be improved in this way :
i == [ [ ] ] dip dip zap
i == [ [ ] ] dip dip dip

Facebook WEST POINT , N.Y . 
The Army , forced by five years of war to expand its ranks , faces a critical shortage of midlevel officers , interviews and military records show .
Those officers — majors and lieutenant colonels — manage troops at war .
The Army estimates it has about 13,900 majors and 8,750 lieutenant colonels this year .
It expects to have an annual shortage of 3,000 such officers through 2013 as it increases its ranks by 40,000 soldiers .
Beyond the shortage of midlevel officers looms an impending shortage of entry - level officers — lieutenants — from the U.S. Military Academy and university Reserve Officers ' Training Corps programs .
Last year , 846 cadets graduated from West Point ; the goal was 900 .
There were 25,100 enrolled in ROTC out of a goal of 31,000 , according to a report by the Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) , Congress ' investigative agency .
TROOP BUILDUP : Bush wants funding for 8,200 more
Only an increase in soldiers put through the Army 's Officer Candidate School allowed the service to meet its goal for lieutenants , the report said .
The school is a 14 - week course that obligates graduates to two years in the Army .
It is expected to reach capacity this year , the GAO said .
" They 're going to have problems with field - grade officers — big shortages , " says Charles Moskos , a military sociologist at Northwestern University in Evanston , Ill .
" They 're going to have to limp through . "
The shortage of midlevel officers stems from Pentagon decisions 10 years ago to reduce the number of officers commissioned after the Cold War , the GAO said .
Officers are staying in the Army at historically high rates , says Lt. Col.
Bryan Hilferty , an Army spokesman at the Pentagon .
The Army just needs more to feed its growing ranks .
" We are short about 3,000 midgrade officers , particularly majors , and we will be for the next several years , " he says .
The GAO report says officer retention has been a problem for the Army , in part because it " continues to remain heavily involved in combat operations in Iraq and Afghanistan . "
In 2005 , 62 % of West Point graduates stayed beyond their five - year active - duty commitment .
That 's as much as 30 percentage points lower than the rates for graduates of the Navy and Air Force academies .
Expanding educational incentives could help the Army keep younger officers .
For example , the Army offers to pay for graduate school for midlevel officers .
Navy and Air Force graduates often remain in service longer because of flight training programs that require longer active - duty commitments than the Army , said Col.
Kelly Kruger , director of West Point 's office of policy , plans and analysis .
West Point graduates are also attractive to the private sector , Kruger says .
" They 're highly sought - after .
It 's also a tough life for young officers . "
Cadets know about " five and fly , " the practice in which officers leave the Army after their five - year commitment , says cadet Liz Verardo , 21 .
She says she is considering an Army career as a helicopter pilot .
Jon Nielsen , West Point 's highest - ranking cadet , says cadets know the toll that war is taking , but that has n't deterred them .
Nielsen , 25 , says he had to announce the deaths of about 10 academy graduates to cadets in the span of a couple of weeks .
Despite that , " You did n't have a flood of people heading to the gate to get out . "

SANTA ANA , Calif . 
A federal jury here is being schooled in the nuances and ambiguities of the Chinese language as defense lawyers challenge translations that the government says put the defendant , Chi Mak , at the center of a long - running Chinese espionage operation in the American defense industry .
In testimony yesterday , a linguist for the defense disputed the FBI 's interpretation of wiretaps and surveillance recordings that the prosecution claims are incriminating evidence that Mr. Mak was a covert agent .
Prosecutors contend that a phone recording captured Mr. Mak 's brother calling his handler in mainland China and using a code phrase to identify himself as affiliated with a spy ring called " red flower of North America . "
However , the defense linguist , Eddie Yip , said the words uttered in the recorded call are not " hong hua , " which could mean red flower , but " hong fa , " which could mean " Wang prosperity , " the name of a Mak family company .
Asked how sure he was that the Mandarin word for flower was not on the recording , Mr. Yip said , " 100 % . "
Mr. Yip also undercut the government 's interpretation of a noisy surveillance recording made in Mr. Mak 's car five days before his brother and sister - in - law were arrested at the Los Angeles International Airport as they prepared to carry to China a disk containing encrypted data on submarine propulsion technology .
The prosecution contends that Mr. Mak can be heard discussing a CD and later using Chinese words meaning " encrypt . "
However , Mr. Yip said the phrase he heard has a far more innocuous meaning , " all of them . "
A defense lawyer , Marilyn Bednarski , also played the recordings aloud to demonstrate to jurors that the sounds are often murky and hard to make out .
Classical music can be heard in the background of the recording from Mr. Mak 's car .
The defendant chuckled , and some jurors looked at him sympathetically as one of his loud yawns was played again and again over speakers in the courtroom .
The defense also stressed that sounds in Chinese often correspond to multiple written words or meanings , making context essential to accurate interpretation .
FBI linguists scoffed in the gallery as Mr. Yip took issue with their interpretations of the key phrases .
A prosecutor , Craig Missakian , brandished Chinese dictionaries and suggested that when translating a phrase found in another recording , Mr. Yip overlooked translations that mean " secret " or " confidential " and seized on others that mean " compressed " and " made tight . "
" I cannot type the whole dictionary into one page , " Mr. Yip replied tartly , before noting that he had listed encryption as one possible translation .
Mr. Missakian also challenged the defense linguist 's credentials .
While Mr. Yip , a former corruption investigator in Hong Kong , claimed to be fluent in Mandarin , Cantonese , and Shanghainese dialects , he conceded that he did not pass an oral language examination administered for the California courts .
He said continues to work in the courts because the test is not yet mandatory .
Mr. Mak , a naturalized American citizen who worked as an electrical engineer for defense contractors in southern California , is charged with violating export controls , acting as an unregistered agent for the Chinese government , and lying to investigators .
He has not been charged formally with espionage .
Four other members of his family have been charged in the case and are expected to go on trial separately next month .
Jurors also heard yesterday from an engineer who worked with Mr. Mak in the 1980s , Suresh Gupta .
He said he worked regularly on a submarine project for the Navy , known as the USS Dolphin , even though he was not an American citizen .
Mr. Gupta said could he bring foreign nationals onto the submarine without any scrutiny and took no particular precautions with the plans .
" I was supposed to design the whole thing from home , " he said .
Prosecutors noted that the USS Dolphin is not a nuclear attack submarine like the ones Mr. Mak helped design .

Scientists have unveiled plans to create a digital library of all life on Earth .
They say that the Digital Automated Identification System ( Daisy ) , which harnesses the latest advances in artificial intelligence and computer vision , will have an enormous impact on research into biodiversity and evolution .
Daisy will also give Britain 's army of amateur naturalists unprecedented access to the world 's taxonomic expertise : send Daisy a camera - phone picture of a plant or animal and , within seconds , you will get detailed information about what you are looking at .
Norman MacLeod , the Natural History Museum 's keeper of palaeontology , has spent several years developing the new technology .
He said that Daisy will make the identification of plants and animals more objective and directly comparable .
" Right now , taxonomy is as much of an art form as it is a science , " Prof MacLeod said .
He will present his vision for Daisy to an international meeting of taxonomists at the museum today .
Taxonomists normally identify specimens through a painstaking process in which the features of an unknown plant or animal are compared with identified specimens in the museum 's collections .
If it is sufficiently different , the unknown specimen is confirmed as a new species .
However , there is plenty of room for error - the museum 's collection might be incomplete or the person making the identification could make a mistake .
If scientists did not have to make routine identifications and teach others how to do it , argues Prof MacLeod , they could get on with the business of learning more about biodiversity and evolution .
" Say you saw a butterfly , you might take a digital image of it , connect up to the world wide web and access a Daisy internet portal , " said Prof MacLeod .
" The portal would accept the picture and farm it out to the servers in individual institutions , such as the Natural History Museum . "
Using pattern - recognition software , Daisy would try to match the picture with images in its archives .
" The portal would route the answer back as a web page that had the confidence level of the identification and the institution that made the identification , " said Prof MacLeod .
Daisy can also identify sounds and scans of DNA barcodes .
For something so useful , it is perhaps a surprise that no one has thought of such a system before .
According to Prof MacLeod , the hold - up has been the lack of neural network software - programmes that learn - required by Daisy .
" New developments in artificial intelligence and computer algorithms have taken neural nets to where they act more like human intelligence , " he said .
" When we see something new , we do n't have to re-compute our understanding of everything else we 've ever seen , we just add it to the mix .
That 's pretty much what we 're doing with Daisy . "
The other limitation with Daisy is that the system will only be as good as the quality and quantity of its reference images .
" Museums are only just starting to get into that type of work , " said Prof MacLeod .
" That has its own technological and storage and manpower barriers .
" Now there 's a tool that we can use to justify making the investment in getting these collections of images together and building the software structures that are necessary to make the neural net able to access the images , then there 's a reason to do it . "
There is also a role for Britain 's army of amateur naturalists in improving the library .
" One of the neat things about Daisy is that , if you submit an image and it's identified with a high level of certainty , that can then be added to the library of images , which makes Daisy more powerful , " said Prof MacLeod .
" That information can keep growing .
The more people that use [ the system ] , the better it gets . "
He said that the first images and sounds have already been used to test that everything works .
But filling Daisy with data from all the museums will take several years .
The Natural History Museum has 70 million specimens that would need to be entered into the database .
Daisy is part of a series of projects set up by the museum to identify and catalogue life on Earth .
In February , the museum announced plans to record the genetic fingerprints for the species , to begin the process of providing a kind of biometric identity card for millions of species by 2010 .
Mischa Barton is moving to London - to learn how to act .
'The O.C. ' star - whose character in the smash hit TV show .
Marissa , was recently killed off - feels naturally drawn to her British birthplace .
In an interview with America 's Newsweek magazine , she said : " I am thinking of spending a month in London , living there and taking a course in acting .
" Sometimes it 's nice to go back to your roots .
" The 20 - year - old moved to New York City when she was a toddler , however her older sister , Zoe - who is a barrister - lives and works in London .
Barton admits that was ready to leave ' The O.C. ' but that it was the producers decision to make it happen .
Barton said : " I was really excited that I get to die , to be honest .
" I 've done pretty much everything else with the character .
It was better than one of those lame farewells . "
During her two years on the show , her character had a lesbian fling , shot someone and battled depression , drug and alcohol abuse .
Barton has also ruled out her character returning to the screen in a ' Dallas ' - style dream sequence .
She scoffed : " I hope not .
That would be cheesy . "
Why I love computer science
NOTE : This is an old essay ( probably from about 2003 ) , reposted by popular demand .
I have been a serious computer programmer for many years .
Until I joined the Caltech computer science department , however , I was not fully aware of how rich and varied the field of computer science really is .
Call it the fervor of the newly - converted religious zealot if you will , but I believe that computer science is an outstandingly beautiful field with a great deal to offer the rest of science .
This page is my attempt to describe why I think CS is such a beautiful science .
I will avoid all the usual reasons why people might think CS is good e.g. because so much of modern society depends on computers , or because it 's easy to get a job when you have a CS degree .
I 'm after more substantive reasons here .
I will add to this page periodically as I come up with new ideas and / or clarify my older ones .
The take - home message
The reason why I think that computer science is a beautiful science is that it relates to the execution of programs on computers .
Computers are conceptually very simple machines which are by design finite and deterministic .
The requirement that computer programs run correctly on a finite and deterministic machine forces intellectual honesty on the field of computer science , whereby there are fewer gaps , holes , loose ends and implicit knowledge than in other fields .
I believe that other fields , notably mathematics , logic ( yes , logic ! ) , and physics can benefit from this kind of rigor .
Vagueness is evil !
On a purely emotional level , I really loathe vagueness in science ( or , for that matter , in philosophy and argumentation in general ) .
A vague argument is one that you can't be sure you understand , and if you can't understand it you can't make progress .
Furthermore , the pernicious effects of vagueness tend to be cumulative ; when you do n't understand one argument well , you are even less prepared to understand another argument that purports to build on the first one .
Most sciences include large amounts of vagueness .
The so - called " soft sciences " like psychology and biology do n't even try to be precise except inasmuch as they use statistics to establish their points ( and even then they usually do n't use statistics very well ) .
Hard sciences like physics are n't much better ( physicists are notorious for being sloppy with their mathematics ) .
But computer science is different , as I hope to show .
Computer programs are abstractions made concrete
If you ask most people what the most fundamental science is , they will probably say physics .
Physics is the science that attempts to understand the fundamental laws of the universe .
Assuming a sufficiently perfect understanding of physics , you could hope to understand all of chemistry , biology , psychology , sociology etc. from that foundation ( although I 'm not saying that it 's practical to do so ) .
What is the foundation of physics ?
Aside from experiments , it 's mathematics .
What is the foundation of mathematics ?
Most people would say set theory and logic .
But logic is a very abstract field indeed , and very few people , even mathematicians , study it seriously .
For instance , most mathematicians do not need a profound understanding of logic in order to do their mathematical work .
However , computer science also depends on logic for its foundations .
There are many levels to this .
At the most obvious level , a computer program proceeds in a logical manner from its beginning to its end .
At a deeper level , logic guides the development of type systems for programming languages ( see the book by Pierce in the references ) , and abstract logical ideas like decidability become extremely tangible in this context .
For instance , if a new computer language has an undecidable type system it will probably not be practically usable , so you have to know if it 's decidable or not ; it 's not an abstract exercise .
Similarly , it 's possible to use computer programs to clarify issues in logic that might be very obscure otherwise .
Gregory Chaitin shows how a simple lisp program can demonstrate a result related to Godel 's Incompleteness
Theorem much more elegantly than a formal logical proof ( actually , the lisp program is the proof , but you get the idea ) .
These are not isolated examples .
Any computer program is an abstraction , just like any mathematical proof is an abstraction .
However , a computer program is an executable abstraction , which is very different from a mathematical proof , which is not executable .
This leads me neatly into my next argument ...
Computer science is rigorous
Let 's continue with the comparison between a mathematical proof and a computer program .
To do this , let 's look at why mathematical proofs are so difficult to understand for most people .
I 'll ignore trivial issues like notation .
First , any realistic mathematical proof will leave out a great many steps , which are considered to be the " required background knowledge " for anyone who wants to understand the proof .
By the way , a very interesting project called the metamath project is trying to create an online archive of mathematical proofs which are specified all the way to the bottom , starting from set theory .
But this is a very rare exception to the general rule .
Second , the arguments presented in a mathematical proof may be very rigorous , or they may occasionally have a " hand - waving " quality to them .
From the standpoint of logic , this means that the inference rules are not always specified accurately , or are not believable if they are .
This is why you will sometimes read a mathematical proof and say " I understand the reasoning , but I just do n't buy it " .
Sometimes the reasoning employed conceals or skirts over very difficult material ; for instance , Newton 's original calculus used infinitesimals , which have long since been abandoned because it is difficult to formulate a rigorous mathematical theory using them .
[ Side note : Abraham Robinson 's nonstandard analysis did exactly that , but it took several hundred years after Newton 's death to get that far . ]
Finally , it is rare to find a mathematical proof that does n't have at least one significant typographical error in it ( especially if it 's written on a blackboard ! ) .
All of these problems make mathematics much harder to learn than it should be ; the learner is required to fill in the gaps , fix the errors and to take the dubious reasoning methods on faith in order to make any progress .
Now let 's look at all these issues as they relate to computer programs .
First of all , a computer program has to be self - contained .
The only background knowledge is the syntactical and semantic rules of the language ( which are ( or should be ) precisely specified and few in number ) , and the knowledge of how the available functions / objects work ( which is generally available in the documentation for the language ) .
If all this information is n't available in some form , the program simply will not work , as the interpreter / compiler will not know what to do with the program .
This forces a certain intellectual honesty on the process of executing a program ; nothing can be left unspecified .
The process of executing a computer program is completely deterministic .
If you know the rules of the game , you know exactly how to get from a particular point in the computer program to all later points .
This is a good thing , too , since when the program does n't do what you want it to do you can then use a debugger to trace the execution of the program , in as much detail as you want .
A typographical error in a computer program will have one of two effects .
First , it may cause the program to fail during compilation or execution .
Either way , you know that something is wrong .
Alternatively , the program can execute to completion but can produce wrong results .
Assuming you have some way of verifying the results ( which is not always the case ) , you will again be alerted that something went wrong .
The point is that there is an inbuilt protection against various kinds of errors , particularly typographical errors , which is n't there in the mathematical proof .
An example
There are many clever ways of specifying extremely simple abstract computational paradigms that are " Turing - complete " i.e. that can be used in principle to write any computer program ( if you believe the Church - Turing thesis , which I wo n't cover here ) .
The most famous of these is the Turing machine .
An even simpler one is untyped lambda calculus , which has just three kinds of expressions :
Variables : a , b , c Functions , also known as lambda expressions : lambda x : e where x is a variable and e is an expression .
If you supply a value for x , e is then evaluated with the value of x you supplied substituted for x in every place in e where there is an x .
Got that ?
Good !
Function applications : e1 e2 , which means to apply the function which is the value of e1 to the expression e2 .
e1 has to evaluate to a function or it's an error .
Combinatory Logic
I x = x ( the " identity " or I combinator )
K x y = x ( the K combinator )
S x y z = x z ( y z ) ( the S combinator )
Now , as if that was n't simple enough , one of the most basic theorems of combinatory logic is that you actually only need the S and K combinators ; the I combinator can be derived as follows :
I = S K K
K x y = x S x y z = x z ( y z ) I = S K K
K x y = ( ( K x ) y ) = x S x y z = ( ( ( S x ) y ) z ) = ( ( x z ) ( y z ) ) I = ( ( S K ) K )
S K K x = ( ( ( S K ) K ) x ) = ( ( K x ) ( K x ) ) = x
(( K x ) < anything > ) = x
< anything >
( K x )
I x = x
S K K x = I x ( ( S K ) K ) x = I x ( ( S K ) K ) =
I ( this is technically called an eta reduction ) S K K = I
What is significant about this result is not the result itself ( cool though it is ) , it 's how the use of the computer ( specifically , the act of writing the interpreter ) made it possible for me to understand the process by which the result is derived .
Of course , you could say that maybe all this shows is how stupid I am ( no argument there ) , but if the example was considerably more complex you can just imagine how useful it would be to have a computer check every step of your work .
This leads me nicely into the final section ...
What can computer science offer the rest of science ?
For instance , there are a number of different kinds of logic .
Most ( all ? ) of these can fairly easily be translated into programming languages of some form .
Why is n't this a routine activity for logicians ?
As for the rest of mathematics , I would like to see computers used routinely to fill in the gaps in published mathematical proofs ( or to alert us to when those gaps can't be filled in ) , so that you never again have to say " I have no idea how the author got from point A to point B " , although you might say " My God , what a lot of equations have to be written down to go from point A to point B ! "
This is reminiscent of Whitehead and Russell 's Principia Mathematica where hundreds of pages pass until the authors can prove that 1 + 1 = 2 .
Annoying though this might be , I think it 's much better than hand - waving .
I can see that something similar might be possible in physics , but it would be much harder , since the level of rigor in most physics papers is quite low .
Perhaps this means that computers can have an even bigger impact in physics than in mathematics .
I do n't know , but it 's something that 's worth thinking about .

After publishing that article , more than anything else I noticed ... silence .
People apparently thought Microsoft was in the right , or they were too afraid of the software behemoth to dare raise their voices .
In any case , I received very little correspondence about Microsoft , while at the same time receiving a blizzard of correspondence about God ( in re " On Believing " ) .
It 's an interesting time we live in , when people are comfortable criticizing how God runs his business , but are n't comfortable criticizing how Bill Gates runs his .
Four years later , because of a dramatic decline in Microsoft 's position in the world of computer software , and aware of its increasingly dated content , I decided to remove this page 's original content .
As time passed , as Microsoft began to act more and more like a petulant child , and as their position and influence have declined , my original combative prose seemed increasingly like ridiculing a handicapped person on the street , behavior no civilized person would accept .
So , for a spell , this page said little more than " Content Withdrawn . "

The reasons for the present sad state of the Windows code base are easy to state .
Windows has evolved over time from a rather primitive application meant to move files from a computer 's memory to a floppy disk ( hence its original name " DOS " 2 ) .
Over time , reminiscent of human DNA and for the same messy evolutionary reasons , Windows has come to harbor within it an unbelievable fruit basket of sheer garbage that has managed to attach itself to , and make itself seem essential to , the overall functioning of the organism .
One example is the presence of , and support for , drive letters , one of the many Achilles ' heels built into Windows .

Drive Letters
Please excuse this digression into a seemingly minor point .
A drive letter is a throwback to an earlier era of computer science , a time when the ability to create a named abstraction for an unadorned number had not yet been dreamt of .
A drive letter is in essence a base - 26 number that identifies a storage device .
Modern operating systems identify storage devices by function or content rather than by number , with many advantages to both the human and the machine .

Modern operating systems identify storage devices by function or content rather than by number , with many advantages to both the human and the machine .
The drawbacks to identifying storage devices by number are legion , but this one example will suffice — if you move your hard drive from one location to another within your computer , and if the drive happens to contain a copy of Windows , the system will cease to function until you adjust your expectations downward to conform to Windows ' innate limitations .

There are a number of hacks to get around this Windows throwback .
Most involve — well , I can't think of any other way to say it — lying , translating reality into a form that Windows will understand , crafting a tale at odds with reality .
It would be like bringing a Stone Age man into modern times and expecting him to be able to function .
But to prevent the caveman 's mental breakdown you would have to lie about certain things .
I personally do n't want to be there when the caveman learns women have the right to vote .

It would be nice if the Stone Age man did n't care that women can vote , and it would be nice if Windows did n't care where you locate your storage devices .
Modern people should only care about the content of your character , not your race , gender or where you live .
By the same token , modern operating systems should only care about the content of a storage device , not where it is plugged in .

My readers may wonder why I rant about this at such length .
It 's because , at a time when computers can reliably connect up with each other through thin air in a busy marketplace , Windows still bluntly and stupidly refuses to accept your having changed the connection point for a storage device .
And Microsoft wants to charge you a lot of money to have this experience .

EULA
In a number of ways , Vista repeats earlier Microsoft product releases .
First comes the announcement of an upcoming revolution in operating system technology .
Then , over a period of months or years , the original grand plans are abandoned piecemeal .
The ship date slips off into the future .
Then the product finally arrives and turns out to be an incremental update of the prior version , an example of evolution , not revolution .
But there is one difference — along with abandoning the primary design goals for the new Windows version , this time Microsoft has declared open war on its customers .
There is a contract between Microsoft and its customers , a contract named the End User License Agreement ( EULA3 ) .
It represents the formal mutual agreement between the seller and the buyer of Windows , and the new version is quite a read .

The new EULA is so restrictive that , in my opinion , people would refuse to buy Windows if they fully understood it .
Here are some points from the small print :
The new EULA is so restrictive that , in my opinion , people would refuse to buy Windows if they fully understood it .
Here are some points from the small print : A particular copy of Vista can only change hands once .
After that , your expensive copy of Windows becomes a cup coaster , a reflective plastic bauble .
Users may only carry out a major system hardware upgrade ( example : new motherboard ) , or migrate to a new computer , once .
After that , they must buy a new copy of Windows ( see updates below for a hasty revision to this condition ) .
As to the increasingly popular practice of " virtualization4 " , if you buy one of the consumer versions of Vista , Microsoft simply wo n't allow it to happen .
To meet the terms of the EULA , Windows can't be a guest operating system , it must be the only operating system .
Sounds like garden - variety narcissism to me .
According to the EULA , one can " use " but not " share " the Vista display 's icons , images , sounds and media .
No one seems to know what this means .
Does it mean one cannot project the Vista display onto a screen in front of an audience ?
If so , this will seriously limit its usefulness to business professionals , or anyone foolish enough to purchase PowerPoint along with Vista .
This phrase leaps off the page : " You may not work around any technical limitations in the software . "
Again , no one really understands the intention behind this language , but in my view , this short sentence by itself is ample reason to avoid the entire Vista experience .
I spend much of my time working around technical limitations in software , as do all computer science professionals .
It appears the true intent of this clause is to turn Microsoft 's customers into supplicant drones .
Moving beyond the pale , Microsoft has decided to control how computer professionals report Windows test results as a condition of their purchase of Vista .
Put in everyday terms , in the new EULA , Microsoft asserts the right to control what people say about Windows in the press .
Taken at face value , this means the only reason I can pen and publish this article and not hear from Microsoft 's lawyers is because I avoid too much technical detail .
This is just a short sampling of the content of the new EULA , and prospective buyers should remember that Microsoft reportedly struggled to redefine the terms of the old , less restrictive , EULA after the fact .
Also , there is an important legal principle here ( IANAL5 ) that everyone needs to understand — regardless of the pure motives of the parties to a legal contract , the contract may contain

Also , there is an important legal principle here ( IANAL ) that everyone needs to understand — regardless of the pure motives of the parties to a legal contract , the contract may contain " unconscionable " requirements , meaning requirements no reasonable or informed person would agree to if he grasped their meaning .
Only time will tell whether this caveat applies to the Vista EULA .
Alternatives to Windows
sine qua non of operating systems , the standard by which other operating systems are defined ?
In point of fact , no — Windows is an atavism , a throwback .
In an apt commentary on how human societies work , Windows is the mediocre least common denominator that has come into a position of dominance by sheer force of persistence and ubiquity ( in this connection , does the name " George Bush " ring a bell ?
No , wait — does the name " Pavlov " ring a bell ? ) .

Windows advocates point out that Windows is easier for an untrained person to install and use , and they 're quite right as well , although this issue is being addressed .

At a time when the entire Linux code base is out in the open for praise or criticism , Microsoft is trying to censor its technical critics , keep them from speaking openly about matters of public concern6 .
At a time when Linux is free ( as always ) , Microsoft is raising its prices again .
At a time when Linux is being adopted worldwide by governments , schools and individuals impressed more by power and reliability than corporate loyalty , Microsoft is offering less and demanding more than ever before in its history .

Ironically , some of Microsoft 's most vehement critics work for Microsoft .
Here 's a quote from a 2004 e-mail written by Jim Allchin , a senior executive at Microsoft : " I 'm not sure how the company lost sight of what matters to our customers , both business and home , the most , but in my view we lost our way .
I think our teams lost sight of what bug - free means , what resilience means , what full scenarios mean , what security means , what performance means , how important current applications are , and really understanding what the most important problems our customers face are .
I see lots of random features and some great vision , but that does not translate into great products . "
Could n't have said it better myself .
After fighting and losing the good fight , Mr. Allchin announced he is leaving Microsoft at the end of 2006 .

Could n't have said it better myself .
After fighting and losing the good fight , Mr. Allchin announced he is leaving Microsoft at the end of 2006 .
Within a day of the posting of the above article ( and before the official Vista release date ) , Microsoft backpedaled and decided to allow more than one reinstall of Vista .
Their explanation ( in part ) : " You may uninstall the software and install it on another device for your use .
You may not do so to share this license between devices . " ...
" Our intention behind the original terms was genuinely geared toward combating piracy ; however , it ’s become clear to us that those original terms were perceived as adversely affecting an important group of customers : PC and hardware enthusiasts . "
Real boardroom - speak .
My suggested translations : " There was such a hue and cry over the original restriction that we had to relent . "
" Although our corporate focus is on those who have no choice about using Windows , we did n't want to annoy those others who actually like computers . "
I wonder two things .
One , how long will it be before Microsoft 's fluid and variable licensing terms change again , and two , how many migrations will Microsoft allow ?
They do n't specify , and they did n't allow an arbitrary number of migrations under XP .
This change does n't affect the resale terms , which allow only one sale or donation of Vista to a third party .

I love programmers .
Some of my best friends are programmers .
Also , to be fair to the FizzBuzzers , the spec for this question is flawed , as are all specs as I point out in Why Ca n’t Spec Writers Write Specs .
You gotta love CodingHorror.com .
Once again , Jeff Atwood writes a great post entitled Why Can’t Programmers ..
Program ?
But in this case , ** the best part is in the comments .
Let me explain .
Jeff writes about a simple “ Fizz Buzz ” test given by Reginald Braithwaite .
Here ’s the functional spec .
Write a program that prints the numbers from 1 to 100 .
But for multiples of three print “ Fizz ” instead of the number and for the multiples of five print “ Buzz ” .
For numbers which are multiples of both three and five print “ FizzBuzz ” .
Mind you , this is not a trick question .
It is as easy as it sounds .
Or it should be .
According to Reginald Braithwaite , the majority of comp sci graduates can’t do it .
Naturally , the very first comment to Jeff ’s post solves this simple problem .
But read further and be amazed at how many developers get it wrong in such a public forum !
The problem may not be that these programmers can’t program .
It ’s that they ca n’t read !
I think reading comprehension must be at an all - time low among graduating programmers .
Perhaps it ’s time to bring back more word problems in our curriculum .
Of course we ’ve all seen this lack of reading comprehension in comments to our blog posts , have n’t we ?
As in when someone completely argues against a misinterpretation of your post .
It never fails to amaze me at how some companies I ’ve worked with ( or at ) praise developers who are fast , even if they do the wrong thing because they failed to understand the spec or include so many bugs as to have made the spec irrelevant .
At least he ’s fast !
Indeed !
So what ’s worse ?
A programmer who ca n’t write code , or a programmer who can , but ca n’t follow a spec ?
Virtual Memory
Back in the ' good old days ' of command prompts and 1.2MB floppy disks , programs needed very little RAM to run because the main ( and almost universal ) operating system was Microsoft DOS and its memory footprint was small .
That was truly fortunate because RAM at that time was horrendously expensive .
Although it may seem ludicrous , 4MB of RAM was considered then to be an incredible amount of memory .
However when Windows became more and more popular , 4MB was just not enough .
Due to its GUI ( Graphical User Interface ) , it had a larger memory footprint than DOS .
Thus , more RAM was needed .
Unfortunately , RAM prices did not decrease as fast as RAM requirement had increased .
This meant that Windows users had to either fork out a fortune for more RAM or run only simple programs .
Neither were attractive options .
An alternative method was needed to alleviate this problem .
The solution they came up with was to use some space on the hard disk as extra RAM .
Although the hard disk is much slower than RAM , it is also much cheaper and users always have a lot more hard disk space than RAM .
So , Windows was designed to create this pseudo - RAM or in Microsoft 's terms - Virtual Memory , to make up for the shortfall in RAM when running memory - intensive programs .
How Does It Work ?
Virtual memory is created using a special file called a swapfile or paging file .
Whenever the operating system has enough memory , it does n't usually use virtual memory .
But if it runs out of memory , the operating system will page out the least recently used data in the memory to the swapfile in the hard disk .
This frees up some memory for your applications .
The operating system will continuously do this as more and more data is loaded into the RAM .
However , when any data stored in the swapfile is needed , it is swapped with the least recently used data in the memory .
This allows the swapfile to behave like RAM although programs cannot run directly off it .
You will also note that because the operating system cannot directly run programs off the swapfile , some programs may not run even with a large swapfile if you have too little RAM .

true convergence of phone + mp3 player will happen when someone solves this user experience puzzle : physically not enough room for two optimized interfaces ( one for calls , one for music ) on same small device .
possible solution : no buttons , replace with touch screen that covers the whole front with one - touch switching between modes …
Once we ’re able to get our hands on it and use the interface , the iPhone could turn out to be a disappointment , but they ’re heading in the right direction at least .

The bold creature , unsurprisingly nicknamed
Whitey , pays a daily visit to Terry
Goulden ’s home , where he taps on the window
every morning until breakfast is served .
He has become such a fixture that Trampas
the border terrier no longer turns a hair
when he arrives .
Mr Goulden , 69 , who makes props for
Hollywood movies , has a five - acre garden full
of wildlife at Ware , Hertfordshire .
He and wife Donella say they first spotted Whitey four years ago and decided to put food out for him on the window ledge .
Whitey is not a total albino because he has
black eyes and feet , not pink .
According to
wildlife experts , the odds of a pure white
squirrel being born are one in 100,000 .
IN 1572 the Privy Council of Elizabeth I , the queen of England , refused to grant patent protection to new knives with bone handles because the improvement was marginal .
It is only natural that things progress , the council reasoned ; minor ameliorations do not cut it .
This week America 's Supreme Court decided likewise .
Ruling on KSR International v Teleflex , a patent dispute centred on the addition of electronic sensors to car - accelerator pedals , the court said that the combination of two existing technologies was not sufficiently “ non-obvious ” to deserve a patent .
“ Granting patent protection to advances that would occur in the ordinary course without real innovation retards progress , ” wrote Justice Anthony Kennedy in his opinion for the court .
To obtain a patent 's 20 - year exclusivity , an invention is expected to be novel , useful and non-obvious — but the third requirement has not been rigorously applied in recent years by the patent office and the courts .
Now examiners and the courts have more discretion to use “ common sense ” .
The ruling has sweeping implications .
“ Nearly every patent in force today is prospectively open to challenge , ” says Bruce Lehman , a former commissioner of the United States Patent and Trademark Office who works at Akin Gump , a law firm .
He expects a huge increase in litigation , longer waits to get patents and ultimately less certainty over their legitimacy .
Yet this is beneficial , believes Brian Kahin , an intellectual - property expert at the Computer & Communications Industry Association , an industry lobby , since it may reduce the number of trivial or dubious patents .
The computer industry welcomes the ruling as a way to thwart the growing number of frivolous lawsuits by “ patent trolls ” — firms that make a business of suing others for violating questionable patents .
But it is a setback for the drug industry , which often seeks new patents for minor tweaks to existing inventions , such as combining one drug with another .
The ruling is just one in a string of recent cases in which the Supreme Court has sought to reverse the trend towards making patents easier to obtain and enforce .
Last year in a case involving eBay , the biggest online auction site , the court tightened the standards that determine when an injunction can be used to force a firm accused of patent infringement to stop trading .
In January the court ruled in a dispute between two biotech firms that companies which license a patent from its owner may still challenge its legality .
And this week in a separate decision the court ruled in favour of Microsoft , the world 's biggest software company , and against AT&T , the world 's biggest telecoms firm , in a dispute over damages for patent infringement .
It ruled that such damages should be limited to sales in America , but not abroad .
This will help Microsoft in another infringement case in which it was ordered to pay $ 1.5 billion to Alcatel - Lucent , a telecoms - equipment firm , largely on the basis of sales outside America .
The underlying problem is that as the number of patents , and the value of each one , has increased tremendously , the system has been slow to adapt ( see chart ) .
The flood of applications taxed patent offices , creating huge backlogs and lengthy delays .
Standards slipped .
The number of lawsuits and value of settlements shot up .
Attempts over many years by Congress to reform the system stalled , owing to a lack of agreement between the computer and drug industries on what should change .
So the Supreme Court 's decisions try to do what policy - makers could not .
How non-obvious an idea needs to be to qualify for a patent has long vexed America 's legal minds .
The invention had to be “ something more than the work of a skilled mechanic , ” the Supreme Court opined in 1850 .
In 1941 it set the bar higher , requiring a “ flash of genius ” .
In 1952 Congress loosened the standard , stating that the idea simply needed not to be obvious “ to a person having ordinary skills ” .
This week 's ruling provides the contours of a modern patent policy , by implicitly stating that inventors ought to be familiar with practices from other fields and that combining existing technologies is not enough , says Dominique Guellec of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development .
It may thus end the boom in reviled “ business - method patents ” , which often entail the application of obvious things , such as shopping or auctions , to an online setting .
And it will probably prompt patent regimes in other countries to become more stringent , too .
To prevent shortages , some cities have begun to adjust their meter rates ( using trial and error ) to produce about an 85 percent occupancy rate for curb parking .
The prices vary by location and the time of day .
Drivers can usually find a vacant curb space near their destination , and the search time is zero .
Cities can adjust the price of curb parking in response to demand to keep roughly one out of every eight spaces vacant throughout the day .
Right - priced curb parking can eliminate cruising .
The balance between the varying demand for parking and the fixed supply of curb spaces is the Goldilocks Principle of parking prices : the price is too high if too many spaces are vacant , and too low if no spaces are vacant .
But when only a few spaces are vacant , the price is just right , and everyone will see that curb parking is both well used and readily available .
Beyond the transportation and environmental benefits , performance - based prices for curb parking can yield ample revenue .
If the city uses a share of this money for added public services on the metered streets , residents and local merchants will be more willing to support charging the right price for curb parking .
These funds can be used to clean and maintain sidewalks , plant trees , improve lighting , remove graffiti , bury utility wires and provide other public improvements .
Returning the meter revenue generated by a district to the district can persuade residents , merchants and property owners to support right - priced curb parking .
Redwood City , Calif. , for example , sets its downtown meter rates to achieve an 85 percent occupancy rate for curb parking ( the rates vary by location and time of day , depending on demand ) .
Because the city returns the revenue to pay for added public services in the metered district , the downtown area will receive an estimated $ 1 million a year for increased police protection and cleaner sidewalks .
The Redwood City merchants and property owners all supported the new policy when they learned what the meter revenue would help pay for , and the City Council adopted it unanimously .
Performance - based prices create a few curb vacancies so visitors can easily find a space , the added revenue pays to improve public services , and the improved public services create political support for the performance - based prices .
If cities want to reduce congestion , clean the air , save energy , reduce greenhouse gas emissions and improve neighborhoods — and do it all quickly — they should charge the right price for curb parking , and spend the resulting revenue to improve local public services .
Getting that price right will do a world of good .
HOW SENATORS VOTED HOW SENATORS VOTED
The Senate voted 49 - 40 this week to require U.S. officials to certify the safety and effectiveness of prescription medicines imported from foreign countries .
The vote effectively killed an effort to allow the importation of cheaper prescription drugs from abroad .
A " yes " vote , supported by drugmakers , was a vote to adopt the certification requirement and a " no " vote was a vote to defeat it .


Senators who raised millions of dollars in campaign donations from pharmaceutical interests secured industry - friendly changes to a landmark drug - safety bill , according to public records and interviews .
The bill , which passed 93 - 1 , grants the Food and Drug Administration broad new authority to monitor the safety of drugs after they are approved .
It addressed some shortcomings that allowed the painkiller Vioxx to stay on the market for years after initial signs that it could cause heart attacks .
However , the powers granted to the FDA in the bill 's original version were pared back during private meetings .
And efforts to curb conflicts of interest among FDA advisers and allow consumers to buy cheaper drugs from other countries were defeated in close votes .
•
A measure that blocked an effort to allow drug importation passed , 49 - 40 .
The 49 senators who voted against drug importation received about $ 5 million from industry executives and political action committees since 2001 — nearly three quarters of the industry donations to current members of the Senate , according to a USA TODAY analysis of data compiled by two non-partisan groups , Center for Responsive Politics and PoliticalMoneyLine .
• Sen. Pat Roberts , R - Kan. , said he demanded removal of language that would have allowed the FDA to ban advertising of high - risk drugs for two years because it would restrict free speech .
Roberts has raised $ 18,000 from drug interests so far this year , records show , and $ 66,000 since 2001 .
His spokeswoman , Sarah Little , said he " takes great pains to keep fundraising and official actions separate . "
• Sen. Judd Gregg , R - N.H. , claimed authorship of a change that reduced the FDA 's power to require post - market safety studies .
He said he wanted to target drugs only if there was evidence of harm .
Gregg has raised $ 168,500 from drug executives and PACs since 2001 and sided with them in four key votes .
•
The bill 's chief sponsors — Sens. Edward Kennedy , D - Mass. , and Mike Enzi , R - Wyo. , — agreed after consultations with industry officials and others to modify a proposal that all clinical drug studies be made public , said Craig Orfield , Enzi 's spokesman .
Under the change , only those studies submitted to the FDA would be available .
Enzi took in $ 174,000 from drug interests since 2001 ; Kennedy , $ 78,000 .
Their spokesmen said the money did not influence them .
Senators also voted down an amendment that would have made it harder for scientists who have accepted money from a drug company to advise the FDA on drug approval applications from that firm .
" It 's not that money buys votes , " said Sen. Bernie Sanders , I - Vt. , the lone vote against the bill .
" But you have a culture in which big money has significant influence .
Big money gains you access , access gives you the time to influence people . "
Orfield , Enzi 's spokesman , said compromise is necessary in the Senate , where 60 votes are needed to overcome any single senator 's objection .
" Our objective is to get something that can pass , " he said .
The pharmaceutical companies spend more money on lobbying than any other single industry — $ 855 million from 1998 to 2006 , according to the non-partisan Center for Public Integrity .
" I do n't think there is any lobbying group in town that has the clout of the drug industry , " said Ron Pollack , director of Families USA , a left - leaning consumer advocacy group .
The biggest drug trade group , Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America , praised the bill after it passed .
The group 's spokesman , Ken Johnson , said its critics " never point out that a great deal of this money is spent trying to defeat bills … that are designed to cripple this industry . "
The bill , which now goes to the House , was based in part on the recommendations of a report by the Institute of Medicine , a division of the National Academy of Sciences .
The Institute was asked by the FDA to examine drug safety in the wake of the scandal over Vioxx , which Merck withdrew from the market in 2004 amid evidence that the drug put users at increased risk for heart attack and stroke .
The report offered two dozen recommendations for improvement .
Chief among those was that Congress should grant FDA the power to require a system of post - market surveillance , which the Senate bill would do .
But two other key recommendations were not followed in the measure :
That FDA should have the power to ban consumer advertising for the first two years of a drug 's market life ; and that FDA scientists who investigate post - market side effects should work in an office separate from those that approve drugs initially .
The bill " does not sufficiently address the underlying problems , " said Sen.
Chuck Grassley , R - Iowa , who in recent years held hearings featuring FDA whistle - blowers who said their concerns about drug safety were ignored .

One way to measure the dangers of various drugs is to examine how toxic the drug is at various levels .
Can too much kill you ?
And how much is too much ?
Here 's an interesting article on what we know scientifically about the matter .
Money quote :
The most toxic recreational drugs , such as GHB ( gamma - hydroxybutyrate ) and heroin , have a lethal dose less than 10 times their typical effective dose .
The largest cluster of substances has a lethal dose that is 10 to 20 times the effective dose :
These include cocaine , MDMA ( methylenedioxymethamphetamine , often called " ecstasy " ) and alcohol .
A less toxic group of substances , requiring 20 to 80 times the effective dose to cause death , include Rohypnol ( flunitrazepam or " roofies " ) and mescaline ( peyote cactus ) .
The least physiologically toxic substances , those requiring 100 to 1,000 times the effective dose to cause death , include psilocybin mushrooms and marijuana , when ingested .
I 've found no published cases in the English language that document deaths from smoked marijuana , so the actual lethal dose is a mystery .
My surmise is that smoking marijuana is more risky than eating it but still safer than getting drunk .
Alcohol thus ranks at the dangerous end of the toxicity spectrum .
So despite the fact that about 75 percent of all adults in the United States enjoy an occasional drink , it must be remembered that alcohol is quite toxic .
Indeed , if alcohol were a newly formulated beverage , its high toxicity and addiction potential would surely prevent it from being marketed as a food or drug .
This conclusion runs counter to the common view that one 's own use of alcohol is harmless .
The least toxic drug known to humans is now illegal .
The most toxic is available at Safeway .
None of this makes any sense at all .
And yet we continue to imprison people for ingesting substances far less harmful than others freely available .
One has to wonder what the prohibitionists are smoking .
Maybe nutmeg .

WHEN Oprah Winfrey talks , people listen -- about 8 million every day .
Which is why a recent Ask Dr. Oz segment on “ Oprah ” is so troubling .
An audience member asked : “ Why do I sweat so much ? ”
After explaining that excessive sweating can result from a thyroid condition , body toxins or hypertension , Dr. Mehmet Oz turned to Winfrey to ask : “ Do you know why African Americans have high blood pressure ? ”
Winfrey replied studiously : “ African Americans who survived [ the slave trade ’s Middle Passage ] were those who could hold more salt in their body . ”
To which Dr. Oz rejoiced : “ That ’s perfect ! ”
Far from it .
Though well - intentioned , Winfrey ’s answer last month effectively lent her credibility , star power and billion - dollar brand to a dubious theory known as the “ slavery hypothesis . ”
This speculates that the disproportionately high hypertension rate among African Americans today is an evolutionary byproduct of the slave trade .
Proponents argue that slaves who survived the food and water deprivation , dysentery and vomiting endemic on this grueling voyage had a genetic predisposition to retaining sodium .
This is believed to have loaded the African American gene pool with genes favoring salt retention , which in turn generates high blood pressure .
In short : Black Americans ’ hypertension rates are nearly twice as high as whites ’ because , as Winfrey and Oz tell it , that ’s just the way they are .

Few scientific theories have been so thoroughly discredited .
Since it was first popularized by Dr. Clarence Grim in 1988 , there has been absolutely no biomedical data supporting the slavery hypothesis as a legitimate scientific conclusion .
In fact , only one supporting peer - reviewed article has been published , and it has been soundly refuted .
For a physician to casually discuss this on a nationally syndicated talk show ( wearing scrubs , no less ) as if it is medical fact is at best misleading and at worst pop-culture medical malpractice .
The slavery hypothesis is questionable at face value .
The theory ’s proponents argue that the Middle Passage created what population geneticists call a “ bottleneck , ” in which a drastic event -- such as genocide or , in this example , forced migration -- leads to a selection process in which the survivors share a hereditary trait that was necessary to live .
But most experts in the field do n’t buy it .
Although predisposition to salt retention may have advantaged some individual slaves , other factors -- such as new selective pressures in North America and mating with non-Africans -- would have increased genetic variability , not constricted today ’s African American population to one common hypertension gene .
Also important is the fact that no contemporary West African population suffers from rampant hypertension .
Historical records suggest that Africans ’ overall mortality during the Middle Passage was about 13 % .
For a bottleneck theory to hold up , the alleged “ salt sensitive gene ” would have had to play a significant role for the roughly 87 % that survived , implying that this gene was relatively common among enslaved West Africans .
But if that were so , a sizable number of today ’s West Africans would similarly exhibit hypertension as their own salt consumption increased in modern times .
This has not been the case .
Epidemiologist Dr. Richard Cooper has shown , for example , that the prevalence of hypertension among Nigerians is significantly lower than white Americans , while Germans and Finns have a higher prevalence than black Americans .
Surely , much more is going on here than genes .

Like a game of whack - a- mole , the slavery hypothesis keeps popping up in the media , popular culture and even medical texts no matter how many times it is slammed down .
It has come to symbolize the incessant way in which unfounded biological theories of racial difference continue to thrive despite significant evidence to the contrary .
Countless studies show that stressful environments and situations raise blood pressure .
And few things are as consistently stressful as being black .
By almost every measurable social category -- such as income , infant mortality , education , incarceration rates and employment -- blacks fare poorly , making everyday life a constant struggle .
Only a buried - head ostrich would say that racial discrimination does not play a role in many African Americans ’ poor health .
What ’s so pernicious about this “ bad gene ” theory is that it attributes current health disparities to actions taken nearly four centuries ago , when the more relevant issue may very well be what is happening today .
Reducing health disparities to genes obscures more sensible conversations about the contemporary nature of discrimination , how it affects minority health and how best to improve health outcomes .
Racial disparities in health are real .
But a bit of caution should be exercised when playing the gene card to explain them .

This is not to say that genetic research has no value to minority healthcare .
Rather , in a world with finite resources , it ’s regrettable that we continue to invest millions of research dollars -- and valuable public air time -- looking for genes to explain racial disparities in health , when so many causes lie simply in how we treat one another .
About 500 detainees are thought to remain in Guantanamo
But the resolution , which was supported by 84 votes to 14 , also denies suspects being held at the US jail in Cuba the right to challenge their detention .
A call by Senator John McCain to ban torture and cruel treatment was included in the resolution .
Bush officials are thought to object strongly to the McCain amendment .
Policy on how to deal with terror suspects is an area which until now has been jealously guarded by the Bush administration .
Democrats and Republicans alike voted on the resolution to allow appeals once inmates have been tried and sentenced .
However , while they are awaiting trial , prisoners will not be able to challenge their detention in federal courts .
' Open wound '
The controversy over the US treatment of detainees continues to do untold damage to America 's image abroad , writes the BBC 's world affairs correspondent , Nick Childs .
For the critics , it has been a massive own - goal by the Bush administration .
And even those in Congress who sympathise with the administration 's views on detainee rights are impatient to see the arguments put to rest .
Some in the administration are said to support the resolution if it holds out the prospect of reducing the number of legal challenges .
But it is not clear if such a compromise will satisfy the administration as a whole , or its critics .
Senator McCain , a Republican , uses catch - all language in his amendment prohibiting the use of torture and cruel , inhuman , or degrading treatment by any US government agency .
Top officials in the White House - and especially US Vice - President Dick Cheney - have tried to block this .
The hope of some in Congress is that , by presenting a comprehensive package , they can reduce White House opposition but also put the issue to rest as a whole once and for all .
The risk is that it will simply aggravate what remains very much an open wound , our correspondent adds .
Being stuck in day - long workshops for an entire week does bad things to my head .
It makes me want to do bad things to the workshop organiser ’s head with a length of 2×4 .
It makes me wonder what sins I committed in a previous life to be subjected to such torture in this one .
And it makes me see disturbing parallels between the IT world and the totalitarian nightmare of George Orwell ’s novel 1984 .
Come to think of it , these parallels work for the broader business world but I ’ll stick to what I know , namely , IT .
WAR IS PEACE
IT managers and business people in general rarely seem happy if IT staff are feeling relaxed .
The pervading mood I ’ve felt throughout my IT career is that happy staff are n’t working hard enough .
IT staff are saddled with a widespread perception that they ’re overpaid ( which from a certain perspective is true but this aint charity , it ’s supply and demand , mofo ) and so if they dare to be happy as well harsh measures are called for .
Time and time again I ’ve seen deliberate management decisions taken with the intent of creating destructive conflict between individuals , between teams and between the IT and non-IT sections of a company .
Competition in and of itself is a good thing because without it we ’d have stagnation but being competitive does n’t have to mean “ for me to win , you must lose . ”
I ’m appalled to see how often it ’s still accepted “ wisdom ” that crushing your opponents ( within the same company ! ) is the way to success .
The macho , male - dominated world of big business and IT sees perpetual conflict as the desirable state and it ’s absence says that something is wrong .
War is peace .
FREEDOM IS SLAVERY
There ’s a couple of ways to read this one but for me , in the IT world particularly this little bit of doublethink is epitomised by the concept that wireless , always - on , constant connectivity is some wonderful new freedom .
Bullshit .
That ’s slavery .
There has to be a separation between work and home life .
Nobody ever uttered the dying words “ I wish I spent more time at the office , ” yet having the office take over every aspect of your life continues to be seen as a desirable goal .
IT workers are particularly susceptible to this because of the prevalence of gadget fetishism but it ’s a horrible trap .
Nobody at work knows my mobile phone number , private email address or IM contact ( or my blog for that matter ) .
I do n’t have a pager or Blackberry and I never will .
I never dial into the work network from home .
Sometimes people simply have to deal with the fact they ca n’t contact me until the next business day .
I ’ll quit a job before I ’ll be shackled to it day and night .
Time is the one thing you can never get more of and I value my personal time far more than I value being offered the freedom to access my workspace anywhere , anytime through the latest fabulous gadget .
That sort of freedom is slavery .
IGNORANCE IS STRENGTH
This one is everywhere .
Modern communication tools give us the potential to have almost unlimited access to information .
At the same time the desire to clamp down on the flow of information seems to grow every day .
Whether it ’s from a government or a company , we ’re continually hearing that “ You ca n’t have that …
You ca n’t know that …
That ’s a secret …
That ’s proprietary . ”
This goes far beyond the idea of keeping secrets from real or perceived enemies , these days it seems that basic information is withheld from people on the same side on a routine basis .
Whether it ’s a government withholding information from its citizens that the laws of the land say they have the right to know or management withholding information from employees “ for their own good ” it seems we ’re constantly being told our ignorance will make us stronger .
And it goes beyond people in power wanting to enforce ignorance on their subordinates .
It ’s hard to escape the feeling that a large number of people feel that their own ignorance makes them stronger .
I know I ’m not the only one who sees the pattern of behaviour in Bush administration refusing to accept “ intelligence ” that contradicted either broad political goals or specific decisions that had already been made .
And whether it ’s a religious fundamentalist refusing to consider the possibility of evolution , an evolutionist refusing to consider the value of spirituality , a global warming denier refusing to accept the weight of scientific opinion or an environmentalist refusing to consider that they might not have all the answers , it ’s easy to find people who prefer to maintain their current ignorance rather than weaken what they perceive the strength of their position .
More than a few people seem willing to have that as their epitaph : ignorance is strength .
THE FUTURE
One of the most quoted lines from Orwell ’s 1984 is “ If you want a picture of the future , imagine a boot stamping on a human face – for ever . ”
It ’s this line that was resonating in my head as I sat through what felt like the hundredth hour of workshops .
Working in IT , we tend to be more comfortable with the idea of a rapidly changing future and to a greater or lesser extent , we are a part of actively creating that future .
It seems that every technological innovation that can improve people ’s lives can simultaneously be corrupted so that it lessens the quality of life .
Every step taken to make information freer can be adapted or twisted to lock information down further .
Every advance can be used to push someone a step back .
The goals of The Party in 1984 are simple : “ The object of persecution is persecution .
The object of torture is torture .
The object of power is power . ”
Today we have companies who say “ Do n’t be evil ” while collaborating with a regime that represses , imprisons and tortures dissenting voices .
A company that famously said to choose them “ So 1984 wo n’t be like 1984 ” embraces the concept of Ignorance is Strength so fully that they criminalise their most ardent fans for simply disseminating information ( speculative information at that . )
Without wanting to be a starry - eyed techno - utopian , it ’s fair to say that working in IT gives us many more opportunities to promote positive change than the average worker has .
Do we limit ourselves to a life where the object of work is work , the object of technological change is technological change ?
( and dare I add the object of blogging is blogging ? )
It ’s worth asking ourselves what contributions our decisions are really making .
So what do you do about it — if you think " Not Safe For Work " censorship has gone too far ?
NSFW is unmandated , unlegislated censorship — there 's no ballot to punch , no senator to harangue .
The great majority of NSFW warnings are the result of unconscious class bias , with the conceit of American ethnocentrism .
It 's made a mockery of out of journalism and the First Amendment .
NSFW and its slippery slope of " assumptions " leads to stories and ideas of all kinds being banned , firewalled , off the grid in places from universities to major wire services .
Let 's change our own responses .
1. Unless you would tag The New York Times , The New Yorker , Vogue , Vanity Fair , Rolling Stone , and Art World as " NSFW " — do n't tag anyone else who covers the same turf of sexual politics , erotic culture , and the full breadth of the English language .
And yes , those editors publish bare breasts — in some cases , every issue .
Think about the media class distinctions every time , and you 'll find yourself exercising freedom of speech .
It 's that easy .
2 . What if you want to tell your dear old fragile Aunt Dot about a spaghetti recipe , but you 're worried she might take offense at the rest of the site , or worse , blame you for impropriety ?
Try being direct and nonchalant :
Dear Aunt Dot ,
Thought you 'd love this recipe .
[ Susie 's ] site is feminist / leftwing / sassy / bohemian , but I thought you 'd like it .
3 . Sick of the false consciousness that runs this rating game ?
Start a new labeling system that mocks the whole concept .
Yep , it 's time to announce : NSFP : Not Safe For Prudes .
Feel free to stamp it everywhere , or use the Li'l Bandit logo above !
4 . What if you 're reading a site at work and one of your co-workers / supervisors interrupts you with a shocked glance and demands to know what you 're up to ?
Again , imagine you were reading one of the magazines above .
You would say , " Why , I " m reading an article about Kurt Eichenwald going off the deep end in New York magazine ... what about you ? "
Do not take the " prude bait " that there is something particularly unusual about what you 're reading at your desk .
It 's a big world out there .
5 . You work with someone who 's a leering , porn - obsessed pig who all but rubs himself down with hand lotion every time you need to borrow a paper clip .
Solution :
The problem is boundaries and privacy .
That 's how you address the problem .
Many of us do n't like to listen to bigoted , narcissistic , neurotic demands for attention all day , but NFSW lunacy is n't working for anyone .
The creeps do n't stop being creepy , no matter how many indexes you give them , and meanwhile , American political and cultural discussion is reduced to infantilism .

The news is good — for once .
Rep. Ron Paul ( R - Texas ) , the libertarian congressman whose dedication to principle is one of the wonders of the world , is running for the GOP presidential nomination ( hat tip : Lew Rockwell ) .
At last — a Republican who opposes our interventionist foreign policy ( consistently and articulately ) and who has this to say about the Iraq war .
Rep .
Paul opposed this rotten war from the very beginning — and , what ’s going to be delightful , is that he is not going to be outdone by any Democrat regarding the Iraq issue .
Better yet , this will exacerbate the split in the GOP over the warÂ and give antiwar activists a banner around which to repair during an election season that would otherwise feature the same rogues gallery of warmongers , fence - straddlers , and all - too - familiar faces .
A number of blogs I read have been talking about Amazon 's S3 service a lot recently .
I 've seen posts from Jeff Atwood , Shelley Powers and most recently Dave Winer .
I find it interesting that S3 is turning into a classic long tail service that works for both startups who are spending hundreds of thousands to millions of dollars a year to service millions of users ( like Smugmug ) to bloggers who need some additional hosting for their cat pictures .
One reason I find this interesting is that it is unclear to me S3 is a business that will be profitable in the long term by itself .
My initial assumption was that S3 was a way for Amazon to turn a lemons into lemonade with regards to bandwidth costs .
Big companies like Amazon are usually billed for bandwidth using 95th percentile billing , which is explained below
With 95th percentile billing , buyers are billed each month at a fixed price multiplied by the peak traffic level , regardless of how much is used the rest of the time .
Thus with the same nominal price , the effective price is higher for buyers with burstier traffic patterns .
So my assumption was that S3 allows Amazon to make money from bandwidth they were already being charged for and not using .
As for storage , my guess is that they are either making a miniscule amount of profit or at cost .
Where this gets tricky is that , if S3 gets popular enough then all of a sudden it no longer is a way to make money from bandwidth they are being billed for but are n't using but instead impacts their actual bandwidth costs which then changes the profit equation for the service .
Without any data on Amazon 's cost structure it is unclear whether this would make the service unprofitable or whether this is already factored into their pricing .
On the other hand , Amazon 's Elastic Compute Cloud ( EC2 ) is n't something I 've seen a lot of bloggers rave about .
However it seems to be the service that shows that Amazon is making a big play to be the world 's operating system in the sky as opposed to dabbling in providing some of its internal services to external folks as a cost savings measure .
With EC2 you can create a bunch of virtual servers in their system and load it up with an Amazon Machine Image ( AMI ) .
An AMI is basically a server operating system and the platform components you need on it .
Typical AMIs are an instance of a LAMP system ( Linux / Apache / MySQL / PHP / Perl / Python ) although I did see one AMI that was an instance of Windows 2003 server .
You can create as many or as few server instances as you need and are billed just for what you need .
I suspect that the combination of EC2 and S3 is intended to be very attractive to startups .
Instead of spending hundreds of thousands of dollars building out clusters of servers , you just pay as you go when you get your monthly bill .
There are only two problems with this strategy that I can see .
The first is that , if I was building the next Digg , Flickr or del.icio.us
I 'm not sure I 'd want to place myself completely at the mercy of Amazon especially since there does n't seem to be any SLA published on the site .
According to the CEO of Smugmug in his post Amazon S3 : Outages , slowdowns , and problems they 've had four major problems with S3 in the past year which has made them rely less on the service for critical needs .
The second issue is that VC money is really , really , really easy to come by these days judging from the kind of companies that get profiled on TechCrunch and Mashable .
If the latter should change , it is n’t hard to imagine dozens of enterprising folks with a couple of thousand dollars in their pockets deciding to go with S3 + EC2 instead of seeking VC funding .
But for now , I doubt that this will be the case .
What I suspect is that without some catalyst ( e.g. the next YouTube is built on S3 + EC2 ) these services will not reach their full potential .
This would be unfortunate because I think in much the same way we moved from everyone rolling their own software to shrinkwrapped software , we will need to move to shrinkwrapped Web platforms in the future instead of everyone running their own ad - hoc cluster of Windows or LAMP servers and solving the same problems that others have solved thousands of times already .
I wonder if Amazon has considered tapping the long tail by going up against GoDaddy 's hosting services with S3 + EC2 .
They have the major pieces already although it seems that their prices would need to go down to compete with what GoDaddy charges for bandwidth although I suspect that Amazon 's quality of service would be better .
Immigration bill would require re-verification of 145 million American workers RAW STORY
Published : Sunday May 20 , 2007 Print This Email
This A story in tomorrow 's New York Times ( reg. req. ) describes how U.S. employers , despite having had a considerable amount of input into the current immigration bill , are unhappy with the result in a number of ways .
In particular , they are worried that a " merit - based " system for allocating green cards would result in the government deciding whom to let in rather than businesses being able to apply for immigrant workers with the skills they need .
However , the area of greatest general concern may be a proposal that would require employers to re-verify the identity of every single person currently employed in the United States .
Not only would it place a considerable burden on both government and business , but the verification system currently being tested has shown a significant rate of error .
Excerpts : # Under a 1986 law , employers are supposed to ask all job applicants for documents to verify that they are eligible to work in the United States .
The Senate bill goes much further , requiring employers to copy the documents and check an electronic database established by the government .
" We can not ask our employers to verify somebody here unless we help them , " President Bush said last week .
But Susan R. Meisinger , president of the Society for Human Resource Management , which represents 215,000 personnel executives , said : " The Senate proposal would require employers to re-verify the identity and employment eligibility of 145 million Americans who are currently employed .
That 's unworkable .
The burden on government and the private sector could cause the system to crash . "
The government has been testing an employee verification system like the one envisioned in the Senate bill .
Federal investigators have found a significant error rate because information in the database is sometimes inaccurate or outdated .

A leading government advisory body has advised schools in Britain not to deploy Microsoft 's latest operating system , Vista , for at least 12 months .
The British Educational Communications and Technology Agency ( Becta ) , which is the British government 's key partner in the strategic development and delivery of information communications technology and e-learning , published an interim report on Wednesday setting out recommendations in relation to the adoption of Vista and Office 2007 .
A spokesperson for the National Centre for Technology in Education ( NCTE ) , which is the Irish equivalent of Becta , told ENN that it had n't received any queries from schools or colleges regarding guidance on deploying any of Microsoft 's latest products .
The Becta report concluded that Vista has no " must have " features in the product that would justify early deployment in schools and colleges .
Moreover , it said the technical , financial and organisational challenges associated with early deployment of the operating system currently make it a " high risk strategy " and should therefore be avoided .
The report recommends that Microsoft should facilitate a small number of pilot activities to clarify what the benefits of deploying Vista in schools and colleges would be , and how much the roll - out would cost .
Becta believes costs of a widespread deployment of Vista are currently estimated to be around £ 160 m while the benefits are unclear .
The agency calculated that it would cost in the region of £ 4,000 for a typical primary school to deploy Vista and as much as £ 25,000 for a secondary school .
Vista was made available to business customers in November and will hit the shelves for consumers later this month .
It comes with a number of key innovations including a new user interface and graphics engine , improved search and a new media player , as well as tighter security and eco-friendly power management features .
Nonetheless , Becta seemed to be decidedly unimpressed with the product .
While it did acknowledge that Vista has enhancements that add value , these are n't considered significant enough to lead schools to upgrade , particularly when stability is taken into the account .
" The version of Windows XP generally agreed to be the most stable became available with the release of Service Pack 2 in August 2004 -- almost three years after the launch of the product .
Windows XP was developed from an existing operating system whereas Vista is a wholly new operating system .
It seems reasonable therefore not to deploy Vista until it has a demonstrably stable and secure track record , " the report said .
Office 2007 , Microsoft 's latest productivity suite , was better received .
However , as with Vista , Becta could find no compelling reasons why schools should consider upgrading , and it reasoned none of the 176 new features found in the product were ' must have ' .
It also noted that most of the new features are aimed at business users .
" Becta has not yet been able to identify any realistic justification for the early adoption of Office 2007 across the educational ICT estate .
Recognising that many educational institutions already have perfectly adequate office productivity solutions , we believe that there would need to be a strong case to justify the necessary investment , " the report added .
The report comes shortly after Nicholas Negroponte , founder and chairman of the non-profit One Laptop per Child association - which recently launched a low - cost portable PC for use in developing countries - said that the current set - up whereby school children are trained using office productivity applications such as Word , Excel , etc was " criminal " .
Instead , he said , they should be using technology to communicate , explore and share .

I see that David Litchfield has posted a note on freelists titled " Re : Sniffing Oracle authentications " that describes the Oracle authentication mechanism and the fact that if you know the Oracle password hash then its possible to sniff the session key and wait for the encrypted password to be sent to the server .
This means that even 30 character passwords using the complete keyspace are vulnerable to attack .
David includes a C program to demonstrate this .
This is a detailed discussion by David of the issue that was first covered by Ian Redfern in a paper titled " Oracle Protocol " that was up on the Logica site for a while before being pulled but the web archive has a copy .
The example Perl program linked in this paper was there on the web archive for quite some time but this has now gone as well .
The Perl program gave an example of how this protocol worked and hinted at this issue .
I found the link via Peter K's blog where he also mentions that Paul Wright now has an Oracle security blog .

Gonzales : ' Compelling reasons ' are too high a standard for the Bush administration in picking personnel Michael Roston
Published : Thursday May 10 , 2007 Print This Email This
In the afternoon session of an oversight hearing of the House Judiciary Committee , Attorney General Alberto Gonzales told a House Democrat that " compelling reasons " were too high a standard to hold the Bush administration to when it comes to making personnel decisions .
Rep. Stephen Cohen ( D - TN ) had pressed the Attorney General on why various US Attorneys were fired , suggesting that there should be " compelling reasons " for their removal from office .
" Do n't you think that when an individual who is a public official , who 's out there in the public line , who 's an attorney , whose reputation is so important to having their license to practice law , that when they 're asked to resign from a position , that there should be a compelling reason and that you as their appointed official should ask and inquire why and realize and come to a belief that there is a compelling reason for them to be terminated , and not just accept some mysterious group 's recommendation ? "
Cohen asked .
Gonzales answered in the negative .
" I think a compelling reason standard is much too high for those of us who are appointed by the President of the United States , and serve at his pleasure , and we all know that , " he argued .
Gonzales assailed for " national secret " A combative Rep. Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) had earlier in the hearing pressed the Attorney General to explain who had asked for US Attorney for New Mexico David Iglesias to be added to the list of Attorneys slated for firing .
As Wexler went through the list of people who could have added Iglesias to the list , he grew exasperated .
" Somebody else other than you , other than the President , other than the Vice President , other than every Deputy Attorney General who 's come to this committee , put him on the list .
But with all due respect , Mr. Attorney General , you wo n't tell the American people on the record who put Mr. Iglesias on the list to be fired !
It 's a national secret , is n't it ? "
Wexler shouted .
When the Attorney General continued to demur on the answer , Wexler continued to press him .
" You were OK with firing him , but you wo n't tell us who made the recommendation to fire him , " he added .
The hearing went into recess so that committee members could return to the House floor for votes shortly before 3 PM .
DEVELOPING ...
Apollo alpha
It 's obviously been quite a while since I 've managed to post something here .
The combination of Adobe and Macromedia has been keeping me and many others quite busy and is now beginning to show some of the results of our combined engineering teams -- it 's very exciting to see the work we 've been up to starting to come to fruition .
As part of this , today we released the alpha of Apollo and soon Creative Suite 3 will be released with incredible integration across the whole toolset .
One of the main forces driving the innovation and the development of the software at Adobe is seeing where developers are pushing the edge of what 's possible to implement , and then enabling more developers to accomplish that kind of work .
Taking the way - back machine to 2001 , you would see the web being widely used and the early signs of web sites containing not only pages but also interactive applications .
These applications were primarily using HTML forms and relying on web servers for processing the form information .
A handful of leading edge developers were working to implement a more responsive interaction by taking advantage of client - side processing with ActionScript in Flash .
One of the earliest examples of successful interactive applications was a hotel reservation system , which moved from a multi-page HTML form to a one - screen , highly interactive reservation interface that increased their online reservations by 89 % .
Clearly , responsiveness matters as it creates a much more effective , engaging experience .
However , in 2001 there was a lot to be desired in terms of performance , power of the scripting language , ease of debugging , and design constraints for applications within browsers .
We did a lot of brainstorming and talked extensively to developers at that time and decided to embark on a mission to enable this trend , naming the category " rich internet applications " ( RIA ) .
To better support RIAs , we aimed to create :
A tremendously faster virtual machine in Flash Player for ActionScript 3
A development framework called Flex , making it radically easier to build RIAs
An environment specifically to deliver rich internet applications to their full potential , code named " Apollo "
During the dot - com bust , we held onto the vision of enabling this future world of rich internet applications .
We continued to invest in building out a range of technologies and prepared for the day that innovation on the web would ignite again .
The days of innovation have now returned in full force and I am delighted to see rich internet applications coming into their own with Web 2.0 .
Developers are creating applications with a range of technologies and frameworks that tap into the distributed creativity of the internet -- taking advantage of HTML , Flash , Flex , Ajax , and balancing logic between the client and server .
The new virtual machine has been delivered now in Flash Player 9 , enabling ActionScript 3 to run an order of magnitude faster and implement the most recent work on the ECMA standard for the language ( JavaScript follows this same standard ) .
This modern implementation has also now been released as open source with the Mozilla Foundation as the Tamarin project , enabling the Flash Player team to work with Mozilla engineers and others in the open source community to continue optimizing the virtual machine and keeping up with the most recent standards work .
This core scripting engine will be incorporated over time in Firefox , bringing more consistency across scripting in HTML and Flash .
The development framework has also been delivered today as Flex , enabling rapid development through common patterns for interaction and data management , with the whole framework built in ActionScript 3 .
The Flex framework is available for free , and the framework source code is included so you can see exactly how it works .
You can use any editor to write code using Flex , and a specific IDE is also available , called Flex Builder .
As we saw innovation on the web returning and were pursuing this vision , that 's when we decided to unite efforts across Adobe and Macromedia .
While Macromedia was driving rich Internet applications with Flash , Adobe was innovating in delivery of electronic documents , among other areas .
We both saw over time that Macromedia would be adding electronic document capability to RIAs and that Adobe would add RIA capability around electronic documents .
Rather than pursue those paths separately and duplicate efforts , we joined forces to deliver our vision for the next generation of documents and RIAs , bringing together the world 's best technology for electronic documents and the world 's best , most pervasive technology for RIAs .
It 's really a powerful combination of technology and teams .
After we announced the merger , we created a " clean room " team to plan for our next generation of software , drawing on everything we 've learned to date as well as from the potential of bringing Flash , PDF and HTML together in the new Apollo environment for rich internet applications .
The Apollo project is actually our third attempt at creating this new environment .
The first two attempts were part of an experimental project called Central which was code named Mercury and then Gemini after the United States space program , and the current work code named Apollo .
We learned a lot from those first two projects , and as I like to remind the team , Apollo is the one that actually went to the moon .
With Apollo , you can leverage existing web development skills ( HTML , Flash , JavaScript , Ajax , Flex ) to build and deploy RIAs to the desktop .
Just like web publishing allowed anyone with basic HTML skills to create a website , Apollo will enable anyone with basic web development skills to create a desktop application .
The HTML engine in Apollo is WebKit , which is open source and is also used Apple 's Safari browser .
Apollo enables people to more easily maintain a connection with information in their web applications .
Just like a desktop app , Apollo applications have an icon on the desktop , in the Windows start menu , or in the OS X dock .
Also , when you 're running a web application today , it 's a separate world from your computer .
You can't easily integrate local data with your web app .
For example , you can't just drag and drop your local contacts onto a web - based mapping application to get directions to your friend 's house .
With Apollo applications you will be able to this kind of integration as it bridges the chasm between your computer and the Internet .
I believe Apollo represents the beginning of a new medium as the best of the web and the best of the desktop come together .
These applications are fun to build and if you start early , you 'll be able to deliver capabilities in your applications that others wo n't have yet -- especially in terms of increasing the presence of your application on the computer and bridging the web and the desktop .
This is an alpha version of Apollo , and the Apollo team is looking forward to your feedback and wishes -- there are also mailing lists and forum discussion to reach other people working on Apollo or to report issues you find .
The Apollo team and I are very much looking forward to seeing what everyone creates , and to the next generation of applications ahead .
We have an opportunity to keep pushing the boundaries of what 's possible on the internet to make the experience more engaging and effective for people around the world .

Black President More Likely than Mormon or Atheist
James Joyner · · 93 comments
A recent Gallup poll reveals that Americans are much more likely to elect a black man or a woman president than a Mormon or an old man .
More interestingly , they ’d rather be governed by a homosexual than an atheist :
Now , these numbers are prospective .
People know , for example , that John McCain is an old man and that Rudy Giuliani is divorced and yet they ’re doing well in the polls .
Still , the ranking of these prospective attributes is interesting .
With all the talk about Romney ’s Mormon Problem –with some sizable percentage of Americans thinking the religion he belongs to is a cult–this survey would seem to indicate that it ’s less of a problem than being twice - divorced .
That ’s rather interesting given that there seems to be no real stigma to divorce and re-marriage in the society at large .
Further , being 72 years old is massively more problematic , at least theoretically .
I ’ve long known that an acknowledged atheist could never win the presidency .
But who would have guessed that atheists would poll behind homosexuals ?
Wonder what Andrew Sullivan would make of that ?
The battle of Thermopylae was real , but how real is 300 ?
Ephraim Lytle , assistant professor of hellenistic history at the University of Toronto , has seen the movie and offers his view .
History is altered all the time .
What matters is how and why .
Thus I see no reason to quibble over the absence in 300 of breastplates or modest thigh - length tunics .
I can see the graphic necessity of sculpted stomachs and three hundred Spartan - sized packages bulging in spandex thongs .
On the other hand , the ways in which 300 selectively idealizes Spartan society are problematic , even disturbing .
We know little of King Leonidas , so creating a fictitious backstory for him is understandable .
Spartan children were , indeed , taken from their mothers and given a martial education called the agoge .
They were indeed toughened by beatings and dispatched into the countryside , forced to walk shoeless in winter and sleep uncovered on the ground .
But future kings were exempt .
And had Leonidas undergone the agoge , he would have come of age not by slaying a wolf , but by murdering unarmed helots in a rite known as the Crypteia .
These helots were the Greeks indigenous to Lakonia and Messenia , reduced to slavery by the tiny fraction of the population enjoying Spartan " freedom . "
By living off estates worked by helots , the Spartans could afford to be professional soldiers , although really they had no choice : securing a brutal apartheid state is a full - time job , to which end the Ephors were required to ritually declare war on the helots .
Elected annually , the five Ephors were Sparta 's highest officials , their powers checking those of the dual kings .
There is no evidence they opposed Leonidas ' campaign , despite 300's subplot of Leonidas pursuing an illegal war to serve a higher good .
For adolescents ready to graduate from the graphic novel to Ayn Rand , or vice - versa , the historical Leonidas would never suffice .
They require a superman .
And in the interests of portentous contrasts between good and evil , 300's Ephors are not only lecherous and corrupt , but also geriatric lepers .
Ephialtes , who betrays the Greeks , is likewise changed from a local Malian of sound body into a Spartan outcast , a grotesquely disfigured troll who by Spartan custom should have been left exposed as an infant to die .
Leonidas points out that his hunched back means Ephialtes cannot lift his shield high enough to fight in the phalanx .
This is a transparent defence of Spartan eugenics , and laughably convenient given that infanticide could as easily have been precipitated by an ill - omened birthmark .
300's Persians are ahistorical monsters and freaks .
Xerxes is eight feet tall , clad chiefly in body piercings and garishly made up , but not disfigured .
No need – it is strongly implied Xerxes is homosexual which , in the moral universe of 300 , qualifies him for special freakhood .
This is ironic given that pederasty was an obligatory part of a Spartan 's education .
This was a frequent target of Athenian comedy , wherein the verb " to Spartanize " meant " to bugger . "
In 300 , Greek pederasty is , naturally , Athenian .
This touches on 300's most noteworthy abuse of history : the Persians are turned into monsters , but the non-Spartan Greeks are simply all too human .
According to Herodotus , Leonidas led an army of perhaps 7,000 Greeks .
These Greeks took turns rotating to the front of the phalanx stationed at Thermoplyae where , fighting in disciplined hoplite fashion , they held the narrow pass for two days .
All told , some 4,000 Greeks perished there .
In 300 the fighting is not in the hoplite fashion , and the Spartans do all of it , except for a brief interlude in which Leonidas allows a handful of untrained Greeks to taste the action , and they make a hash of it .
When it becomes apparent they are surrounded , this contingent flees .
In Herodotus ' time there were various accounts of what transpired , but we know 700 hoplites from Thespiae remained , fighting beside the Spartans , they , too , dying to the last man .
No mention is made in 300 of the fact that at the same time a vastly outnumbered fleet led by Athenians was holding off the Persians in the straits adjacent to Thermopylae , or that Athenians would soon save all of Greece by destroying the Persian fleet at Salamis .
This would wreck 300's vision , in which Greek ideals are selectively embodied in their only worthy champions , the Spartans .
This moral universe would have appeared as bizarre to ancient Greeks as it does to modern historians .
Most Greeks would have traded their homes in Athens for hovels in Sparta about as willingly as I would trade my apartment in Toronto for a condo in Pyongyang .
TORONTO ( Sunday , 13 May ) :
In a lecture aimed at the students of the ARI Online Education Center course , Rav Michael Laitman , PhD lectured on the essence and the purpose of Kabbalah , its role in human evolution and specifically in the world today ( aired live on Kabbalah TV’s Live Stream ) .
As Rav Laitman motioned to open the lecture with the first sentences of Baal HaSulam ’s article The Essence of the Wisdom of Kabbalah , he quickly detoured , stating in a lot simpler words “ What is it ? ” then proceeding to give his modern version of Baal HaSulam ’s definition in the article :
Definition of Kabbalah :
“ The wisdom of Kabbalah is the revelation of nature ’s laws that are systematically arranged before us so as to bring us to the recognition of the Creator . ” — Rav Laitman ( from the lecture )
Rav Laitman continued the lecture with a discussion of how nature arranges life on the still , vegetative , animate and speaking degrees of nature , how a person living in this world perceives evolution through this arrangement , and how we develop through these degrees in order to achieve blissful , eternal life , perfectly balanced with nature .
The following quote by Rav Laitman ( from the lecture ) defines Kabbalah ’s approach to the state we are being led to , and the ultimatum that Kabbalah states nature is placing before humanity in our era :
Kabbalah on Balance with Nature :
“ Balance with nature is expressed in the wisdom of Kabbalah by the words ‘ equivalence of form . ’
In other words , nature ’s form is in giving everything , and man wants to receive everything , and thus our nature is opposite from nature in general .
We therefore have to bring man to the degree of the Giver , to equalize with it .
In the wisdom of Kabbalah , the degree of the Giver is called ‘ equivalence of form ’ or Dvekut ( adhesion ) .
This is how , in the wisdom of Kabbalah , we define the final goal that we should reach .
If we achieve it , we will have an eternal , perfect and tranquil life , as is nature itself .
If we do not achieve it , nature will constantly pressure us until we completely improve and correct ourselves . ”
The rest of the lecture was a Q&A session between Rav Laitman and the ARI Online Education Center students , questions dealing with how we should relate to violence , the role of religion in humanity ’s evolution , how we should relate to Kabbalistic books , as well as many other questions .

In his post Lohmann provides a brief history about the porting effort for OpenOffice and then indicates that he and another Sun engineers will assist in the porting effort :
" You can imagine my excitement when I first heard about renewed efforts to make an Aqua port reality .
And now finally I can spend my paid time to add to this great effort .
At first Herbert Dürr and I will contribute to the Mac port , however there certainly will be other Sun developers involved in their areas of expertise when the need arises ( e.g. when problems with the build system arise ) . "
Sun identifies an inrease in Mac use
Lohmann cites an increase in Mac use as a reason that Sun is joining the porting effort when he states :
" Some may ask : Why is Sun joining the Mac porting project ?
If you look around at conferences and airport lounges , you will notice that more and more people are using Apple notebooks these days .
Apple has a significant market share in the desktop space .
We are supporting this port because of the interest and activity of the community wanting this port .
The new invigorated effort in Mac / Aqua-porting ( basically since CWS aquavcl01 ) is an obvious indicator .
I think this is the right way to go to make OOo on Mac as good as or even better than the other ports .
Add in the growing Mac community as a whole and suddenly from Sun 's point of view Mac has a higher value since our strategy is to be multi-platform capable . "
What is OpenOffice ?
According to the OpenOffice.org website :
" OpenOffice.org is a multiplatform and multilingual office suite and an open - source project .
Compatible with all other major office suites , the product is free to download , use , and distribute . "

When we talk about reviewing cameras , most people will think about the image quality , user interface , external design and so on .
When those outdoor anti-drop anti-dust anti-splash cameras get reviewed , nobody seems to have the guts to actually test if the camera can really withstand what it claims it can .
Chinese site PConline has tested the Olympus [ mju : ] 770 SW digital camera .
Apart from all the usual imaging tests , they also put the camera through a series of ruthless tests .
They started by having a 75 kg dude stepping on it , then they dumped the camera into the ocean , washed it with soap , froze it … and a lot more .
Jump to find out how hardcore the 770SW is .
First they dumped the camera into the sea , since Olympus claimed that the camera can shoot pictures at up to 10 m underwater .
The camera survived the test and managed to take a couple of blurry photos , but that ’s more to do with water quality than the camera ’s potential .
After that , they washed the camera with soap .
After washing it , they froze the camera in a freezer that can go down to - 7 degree Celsius , since Olympus claimed that the camera can still work at - 10 degree Celsius … and it survived .
Next we have the anti-shock test , so the guys left the camera on and had it tied onto the rollerblade of a kid .
The camera was also put through a drop test , and it survived in the 1.5 meter drop …
As we can see , the Olympus [ mju : ] 770SW managed to deliver what it promised .
We ’re pretty sure that the picture quality ca n’t be too bad , so if you are looking for a hardcore digital camera , the 770SW is a safe buy with evidence .

practicing - programming Practicing Programming
Stevey 's Drunken Blog Rants ™ Back in October I wrote an essay in which I compared programming to other professions .
In it , I made the unsubstantiated claim that programming is unusual , in that most programmers do n't practice their craft -- at least , not in any disciplined or regular way .
Those are , of course , fightin ' words , so I figured I 'd write a bit more about it .
This essay is a sort of mini-manual about practicing to be a better programmer .
What exactly does it mean to practice becoming a better programmer ?
Well , of course the boring dictionary definition is : " To do or perform something repeatedly in order to acquire or polish a skill . "
That definition feels a bit too narrow , though .
I also want it to include the idea of studying , which the dictionary equally boringly defines as : " To apply one 's mind purposefully to the acquisition of knowledge or understanding of a subject . "
If you 're still awake after that mind - numbing paragraph , then I think you 're ready to give it a try !
Studying has a weird way of putting me to sleep , unless I 'm doing it because I want to .
Homework just seems to kill the desire to learn .
Do n't read this blog if someone is insisting that you read it !
Wait until you really think you want to get better at programming , then read it .
Incidentally , I toyed with the idea of coining a new word for " study and practice " , like I did with servware .
Unfortunately , " practudy " sounds like some sort of medical problem , and " studtice " is just unthinkably bad ( " Honey , I 'll be home late tonight -- I 'm working on my studtice . " )
So for this essay I 'll just use the word practice to mean study and practice .
Contrary to what you might believe , merely doing your job every day does n't qualify as real practice .
Going to meetings is n't practicing your people skills , and replying to mail is n't practicing your typing .
You have to set aside some time once in a while and do focused practice in order to get better at something .
I know a lot of great engineers -- that 's one of the best perks of working at Amazon -- and if you watch them closely , you 'll see that they practice constantly .
As good as they are , they still practice .
They have all sorts of ways of doing it , and this essay will cover a few of them .
The great engineers I know are as good as they are because they practice all the time .
People in great physical shape only get that way by working out regularly , and they need to keep it up , or they get out of shape .
The same goes for programming and engineering .
It 's a bit easier to tell if someone 's in great shape physically than if they 're in great shape mentally .
You can't just stare at their brain and hope to find a six - pack in all those folds .
It 's easy to tell how physically fit someone is .
You can make people run laps , lift things , take their physical measurements , etc .
But for determining someone 's mental fitness , you pretty much have to interview them .
It it 's hard to do a good job of it , since it 's like running backwards in front of the person , egging them to go faster .
You have to be in pretty good shape yourself to be a good interviewer .
Smarts vs. Skills
If you need a cornerback for your football team , of course you want someone who 's in outstanding shape .
But they also have to know how to play football -- and in particular , how to play cornerback .
Great football players can sometimes play multiple positions , but most positions are n't naturally fungible ; you can't usually take an offensive lineman and make him a great cornerback or quarterback .
There are some parallels here with finding great programmers .
You want people who are smart , and also who have common sense ( both the regular kind , and the software kind . )
Smarts and common sense are equivalent to being in good shape , and perhaps having good reflexes .
But football -- well , if you know anything about American football , you 'll know that it 's a pretty rich sport .
It 's more like playing chess than playing soccer .
It has elaborate rules ; simply knowing the edge - case rules in the NFL rule book is a significant feat .
It also has elaborate plays with amazing complexity and diversity , even though it just looks like guys hitting each other for 10 seconds at a time .
And football has traditions , uniforms , statistics , all kinds of different coaching roles , referee organizations , tournaments and championships , aftermarket products , games and video games , specialized recruiters , specialized announcers ...
Football is a way of life .
So for that cornerback we need , is it good enough for him to be in good shape ?
Hardly .
Maybe it 's sufficient for a position on a high - school junior - varsity team , but Amazon 's supposed to be more like the NFL than high school J.V. , is n't it ?
I think so .
We hire for smarts and for skills .
Well , we try , anyway .
Sometimes , in a pinch , we 'll settle for one or the other .
Our hiring philosophy is that if someone is smart and motivated , then they should be able to make up for any particular skills they might be lacking , provided they have " enough " of the basic skills according to some ill - defined but hopefully intuitive heuristic .
As it happens , we do n't get much time on the job to improve our skills .
For the most part , it 's up to us , as engineers , to take our own training into our own hands .
Yes , there 's some training , and there 's some mentoring , and there are book club discussions and so on .
But in the NFL , people practice daily .
That 's what practicing is all about -- doing things repeatedly , daily , habitually , to get better as fast as possible .
I doubt we or any company is likely to set up organized daily practice for their engineers .
In fact I personally do n't think it should be necessary .
The most important thing you learn in college is how to learn on your own .
They teach you how to research , and how to apply the scientific method and question your own findings , and they give you the fundamentals of math / language / social sciences / etc. , so that when you want to learn something , you know how to figure it out for yourself .
Unlike the NFL , programming is a profession for which practicing is usually most effective if you do it alone , or at most with one other person .
It requires quiet concentration and deep thinking , and you absolutely must solve the problems yourself , rather than just seeing the solution done for you .
So even if we wanted to set up organized daily practice , most of it would be spent reading or programming quietly .
In a nutshell : if you 're a programmer , you need to take matters into your own hands , and train yourself .
Programming happens to be a discipline in which you can squeeze practice drills into nooks and crannies in your schedule ; you do n't need to get into uniform and allocate a 3 - hour session for it .
That 's why I 'm offering you these practice drills .
It 's so you can practice the things you need to be good at in order to play on an NFL - quality servware development team .
But I have a job already
Why bother practicing your skills if you 've already made it past the interview , and you 've landed yourself a job here ?
Well , what do you suppose happens if you do n't practice , and you gradually get all mentally fat and out of shape ?
Easy enough to answer !
Go to www.monster.com ( or our resume pipeline ) and look for SDE resumes from people with 20 to 30 years of experience .
Well hey looky , they 're mostly Fortran and Cobol experts , on IBM mainframes , and they 've never done any web programming ( or in fact anything you 've even heard of before . )
They do n't even know Unix , which is only like 100 years old now , in dog years anyway .
Those folks , alas , are obsolete dinosaurs , and their programming knowledge is formally classified under " archaeology " .
They never pass our interviews , and they 're becoming less and less able to find jobs .
No wonder it 's so hard to find senior SDEs -- most of them are just doing their jobs for 25 years , and now they do n't know anything of value .
We do keep searching for senior SDEs , though , because every once in a while we find someone with great training and great experience and great practice habits .
These folks are often phenomenal , and they make all the search efforts worthwhile .
Of all of your skills as a programmer , how many of them could be considered " timeless ? "
Face it : most of your technical knowledge has a shelf life , an expiration date .
A good exercise ( let 's make it our first practice drill ) is to enumerate all the skills you 've acquired that are relevant to your job as a programmer .
Sort them into two buckets , based on whether the skill will still be useful 100 years from now .
Practice Drill # 1 : Write your resume .
List all your relevant skills , then note the ones that will still be needed in 100 years .
Give yourself a 1 - 10 rating in each skill .
This drill will help you see where you need practice .
It wo n't turn up your " blind spots " -- i.e. , areas that you do n't know anything about ( hence are n't on your resume ) but that you should know something about .
But it 'll at least help you see how current your working skillset is , and how long you expect it to stay current .
And , hey , it 's always nice to have an up - to - date resume .
What I think you 'll likely find is that math , computer science , writing , and people skills are for the most part timeless , universal skills .
Most specific technologies , languages and protocols eventually expire , to be replaced by better alternatives .
Technologies are n't replaced by switching them off overnight .
Once a better alternative comes along , the original technology 's usage follows an exponential decay curve , with a half - life : say , the time it takes for the technology to be used in only half as many places .
And some technologies survive by evolving ( XML is a good example ) ; their half - life is the time it takes for your knowledge of that technology to become only half as valuable .
With evolving technologies like Java or XML , your knowledge will decrease in value if you do n't keep current .
So you need to practice -- not just to improve your skills , but also to keep yourself from becoming obsolete .
Studying by itself does n't cut it , either ; you have to use a technology in order to gain any real familiarity with it .
That 's why this essay is really about study and practice .
Great programmers do both .
The majority of programmers have literally no idea how to practice , since nobody teaches it .
So they simply do n't do it .
The first step towards becoming good at practicing is knowing a thing or two about practice itself .
Practicing for anything is generally best done via drills : short , high - intensity exercises designed to yield the highest return on the time you invest .
In this essay I 'll give you a dozen or so drills that you can practice , in any order , at any time , as often as you like .
None of them should take more than an hour .
However , before I get into some standard drills that good programmers do regularly , I 'm taking you on a quick detour , so we can look at how practicing works in professions that have been around for centuries .
Why ?
Because those folks are pretty darn good at it by now , and they may have some lessons for us .
How most musicians practice I 've had a fair amount of classical music training , so I know how musicians practice -- and what differentiates the good ones from the bad ones .
Because I used to be an extraordinarily bad one .
Picture the average amateur guitarist : A teenager .
Messy hair .
Cheap guitar .
Plays alone , or for baked friends in bedroom in parents ' house .
Knows a few riffs , a few licks .
Can play almost every track on the first two Nirvana CDs .
Puts on a good show for an hour , if you 're a forgiving listener .
OK , got it .
The average guitarist sucks .
How does the average guitarist practice ?
In the years before I started getting serious about lessons , I played a lot -- 6 to 8 hours a day for about 5 years .
I learned a lot of songs , all by memorization , and I had to play them constantly to keep them in memory , so at least 2 hours of every day was wasted just running through the pieces .
Through brute - force effort I eventually started to sound like I knew what I was doing .
Fooled myself and most of the people around me , anyway .
I was practicing WAY too much , and getting very little out of it .
I felt I could muddle through almost anything , but it was clear that I became progressively sloppier as the music became more technically challenging .
And there were some things I just could n't play .
I could memorize them , sure , but I 'd get halfway through them and my hands would just stop working , from sheer exhaustion .
Then I 'd watch professional guitarists play the piece ( or solo , or whatever ) , and I 'd be surprised at how effortless they made it seem .
How could they be so relaxed ?
The problem was that I had no idea how to practice correctly .
The saying " practice makes perfect " is inaccurate , as any music teacher will happily tell you .
Perfect practice makes perfect .
I 'd been practicing sloppily , and had become very good at being sloppy .
For one thing , I was tensed up , trying to force my fingers to make the right moves .
So I only knew how to play tensed up , which exhausts you quickly .
I was actually doing all sorts of things wrong , more than I 'd ever have guessed , but the details are n't important .
What 's important is that I was thinking about it all wrong .
I knew that everyone said you should take lessons , but I had convinced myself that I did n't need them .
I was actually a bit afraid to take lessons , because instructors were telling me I 'd have to " forget everything I knew and start from scratch . "
That was a stupid way to attract new students !
Nobody 's going to want to throw away years of work .
It was also incorrect : lots of the stuff I knew carried forward .
Learning the proper technique turned out to be more like learning a new song than learning a new instrument .
But at the time , I thought : " Screw that .
I know how to play guitar .
I 'm happy with my playing , and I 'm not going to change the way I play . "
I hope you do n't think this discussion is too far afield , because my attitude towards guitar lessons was identical to the way most programmers feel about their technical skills .
" I 'm already great at Perl , so I do n't want to go back to the beginning and learn C , or assembly - language .
I like the way I program . "
Or : " I 'm great at Java , and I do n't see any reason I should have to learn how to write scripts .
I can get by just fine without them . "
The thing is : I was n't a great guitarist , and Perl - only folks are n't great at Perl .
But you can't see that until you 've done the hard work of learning what your instructors are telling you to learn .
Practice Drill # 2 : Make a list of programmers who you admire .
Try to include some you work with , since you 'll be borrowing them for some drills .
Make one or two notes about things they seem to do well — things you wish you were better at .
Simply thinking about good programmers you know , and what makes them good , is good practice in itself .
But we 'll also use the results of this drill in some later drills .
Anyway , let 's compare the average guitarist 's practice techniques ( and philosophy ) to the way real musicians do it .
How great musicians practice Professional musicians have such a rigorous practice methodology that it takes a while to fully comprehend it , let alone apply it .
To get the full picture , you need to take lessons from different people , watch other musicians ( both good and bad ones ) practice , and experiment a lot .
This is n't unique to music .
People practice rigorously in other disciplines too .
Take golf , for instance .
Even Tiger Woods still takes regular lessons .
He 's working more on course management than on his swing , of course , but he still takes lessons .
In hyper - competitive disciplines , even the practice techniques themselves are improving over time .
Real musicianship is the result of studying and applying the theory , history , and performance of music .
Many musicians also advocate studying the physics of sound and music , the construction of musical instruments , the mechanics the human hand and ear , and the psychology of performers and audiences .
The average guitarist is no more aware of these sub - disciplines than your average laborador retriever .
I sure was n't .
I just wanted to play guitar .
Remember that awful Antonio Banderas movie , The Mask of Zorro ?
Yeah , I know .
Painful .
But at one point , Anthony Hopkins asks Banderas if he knows how to use a sword , and Banderas replies : " Yes .
The pointy end goes in the other man . "
That remark actually hit home .
It 's right around the level of sophistication you find in the average guitarist , and ( alas ) in the average programmer .
Music theory is rich and complex .
Most guitarists do n't see any reason to bother with it , since you can " get by " without it .
( I detest that phrase .
Saying you can " get by " without learning anything new is a sure way to make my eyes glow red . )
Yes , you can get by without knowing any theory .
But your playing is just parroting if you do n't understand how the piece was constructed .
Knowing music theory can improve your playing in a hundred subtle ways , with the net effect being a much more professional performance .
Real musicians read sheet music almost as easily as you and I read English .
( Better , for some substitutions of the variable " you " .
Not you , of course .
Other yous . )
It 's amazing to watch .
But most guitarists can't read sheet music .
Instead , they use a crude pictogram notation called " tabulature " , which does n't contain enough information to know how to play a piece without hearing it first .
It 's as lame as it sounds , trust me .
Being able to read real sheet music means you do n't have to worry as much about committing pieces to memory .
It also gives you access to a lot of great music that 's never been recorded .
Sheet music is also beautiful in its own right .
Musicians study the history of music for many reasons .
One reason is simply to know why things are the way they are .
Another is to learn about great past Masters and their extraordinary abilities , and perhaps set higher personal goals .
Mostly , though , it 's a matter of culture .
All the best musicians are totally immersed in the musical world .
The best musicians share ideas and push the envelope of their field ; music history gives them a vocabulary and a set of examples to draw on when fleshing out new ideas .
Knowing your history is important for innovation .
The history of programming , incidentally , is absolutely fascinating .
They were solving problems 30 and 40 years ago that are completely relevant to our work today , and most of us ( me included ) still do n't understand the solutions .
The pioneers of Computer Science -- the Donald Knuths , the Von Neumanns , the Dijkstras and Hoares -- these folks are geniuses , like the Masters of music , and it pays to study their work and their lives .
The history of our field makes for a a richly rewarding study .
Practice Drill # 3 : Go to Wikipedia 's entry for computer science , scroll down to the " Prominent pioneers in computer science " section , pick a person from the list , and read about them .
Follow any links from there that you think look interesting .
If you run out of people to read about , there 's also a list of computer scientists .
Spending a few hours a week in Wikipedia is a fun , easy way to get a feel for our field and related fields .
Make sure you pay attention to the the history and the people .
Makes it more fun .
Finally , there 's music practice .
There are sooo many types of practice .
The common characteristic among them is that practice has to be habitual .
Professional musicians develop daily and weekly practice habits that they keep up for their entire careers .
Practice requires a recurring time commitment .
One type of practice is simply to go listen to other musicians play , as often as you can .
You 'll learn a lot just by watching and listening .
The analogs in the programming world are watching other people program , and reading their code .
Practice Drill # 4 : Read through someone else 's code for 20 minutes .
For this drill , alternate between reading great code and reading bad code ; they 're both instructive .
If you 're not sure of the difference , ask a programmer you respect to show you examples of each .
Show the code you read to someone else , and see what they think of it .
Another kind of musical practice , useful for avoiding memory lapses during recitals , is to close your eyes and envision yourself playing the piece , measure by measure .
It helps to try doing the measures out of order -- starting at arbitrary points , working backwards , etc .
The point is to build up multiple mental models of the piece , to gain a more complete and robust understanding of it .
There are analogs for this in programming that I 'll cover in some drills later on .
When can I play the dang thing ?
A lot of practicing , of course , involves actually playing your instrument .
I bet you thought I 'd never get to that .
But first ( ha ! ) you need to learn a bit about the instrument 's physical characteristics : how it responds to temperature and humidity changes , how the response decay varies with pitch and octave , how the strings sound when struck in different places , even how the instrument responds to the friction of your clothes .
It 'd be kind of embarrassing to drop the ol ' guitar in the middle of a performance .
But not as embarrassing as having your zipper scratch a $ 9000 guitar you have n't bought yet .
Heck , even tuning a guitar is n't a simple proposition .
After you change a string 's tension , it will stretch or contract slightly over the next few minutes in the direction opposite to the change you made .
And you have the Pythagorean Comma to worry about ; tuning an instrument " perfectly " is actually a physical impossibility , so you have to figure out how to strike the right balance for whatever key you 're playing in .
You could write a 30 - page manual on the art and science of tuning a guitar .
Why am I belaboring the tuning thing ?
Because learning how to tune your guitar properly is basically a tools issue .
Many guitarists are perfectly happy to get by with poor tuning , but then they sound bad even if they 're playing well .
Developers are often content to use whatever tools they 've got , without digging in and figuring out how to " tune " the tools for maximum efficiency .
Mastering the tools of the trade is an important part of every professional 's ability to be effective .
Practice Drill # 5 : Make a list of your 10 favorite programming tools : the ones you feel you use the most , the ones you almost could n't live without .
Spend an hour reading the docs for one of the tools in your list , chosen at random .
In that hour , try learn some new feature of the tool that you were n't aware of , or figure out some new way to use the tool .
By starting with the tools you already love using , it 'll be that much easier to get into the habit of exploring their capabilities .
And finally , real musicians do n't practice by playing the piece over and over from beginning to end .
They dissect every piece of music into tiny components and work on each one individually -- every phrase , every note , every fingering , every transition , it 's all worked through , mechanically and musically , for countless hours .
They play it slow , fast , quietly , loudly , even in different time signatures and beats .
And they do daily drills : right - and left - hand finger exercises for building stamina and dexterity .
Sound like a total pain ?
Actually , it 's not too bad at all .
Takes a bit of getting used to , but once you start doing it right , your overall technique improves rapidly .
And you 're no longer " capped " at a particular difficulty level , because you 're not exhausting yourself , and you know how to tackle complex technical passages .
Oh , and one hour of that kind of practice is as good as a week of playing songs over and over .
OK , enough about music already .
The takeaway is that musicians have built up intricate and very effective practice techniques through centuries of experimentation .
It takes formal instruction and a fair amount of personal discipline to master professional practice techniques .
You would n't think of most of them on your own , at least until you get the feel for the overall goals of the practice .
We do n't have centuries of accumulated experience about programming , so we 're still sort of feeling our way along .
But programming is a clearly a complex blend of art , science , logic , engineering , design , and craftsmanship , and we can borrow ideas from all those endeavors .
Hopefully I 've convinced you that you can't become world - class ( or even a competent professional ) in any profession , including programming , without making a serious commitment to ongoing study , training , and practice .
You already knew that , though .
The fact that you 've read this far into my crazy blog means you 're probably already the type who practices a lot .
Or you like to read about it at least , like that Dilbert where he 's reading a book about driving the cart around in a golf video game .
Practice Drill # 6 : Pick something you 're good at that has nothing to do with programming .
Think about how the professionals or great masters of that discipline do their practice .
What can you learn from them that you can apply to programming ?
Now , with your new - found insight , go chop a brick in half with your hand !
Ouch .
Better yet , go play some Doom 3 .
You can't study all the time .
Interviewing is great practice
One of the best ways to get better as a programmer is to participate in the recruiting process : resume screening , phone screening , interviewing , having people mock - interview you , coming up with new interview questions , solving other peoples ' interview questions yourself , all that stuff .
Of course , if you just ask the same questions in interview after interview , you 're not really practicing , and it wo n't help you much .
Here are some recruiting - related drills .
Just fer fun 'n stuff .
Is anyone really still reading this thing ?
You probably all think I 've cracked .
But read on !
I believe I can make the unqualified promise , with no hedging whatsoever , and backed by my personal guarantee and my word as a sportsman and a gentleman , that this essay will eventually end .
Resume screening is a useful practice -- and not just for the comic relief , although that 's certainly one of its draws .
It 's also useful so you can see what people in your industry are doing these days .
Unemployed ones , anyway .
And if you see a particular buzzword appearing more and more often , it 's a sign that you might want to look into it , and see why it 's popular .
Practice Drill # 7 : Get a pile of resumes and a group of reviewers together in a room for an hour .
Make sure each resume is looked at by at least 3 reviewers , who write their initials and a score ( 1 - 3 ) .
Discuss any resumes that had a wide discrepancy in scoring .
Group resume screens are way more fun than doing it by yourself , and probably more accurate as well .
You need at least four or five people , though .
The discussion keeps you from falling asleep .
Phone screening is really hard to do well .
It may not actually be that useful for improving any skills other than phone screening .
However , recruiting is an important part of every programmer 's job , so you should do phone - screens occasionally .
For the drill , we 'll just have you listen in on someone else 's phone screen .
That way you might hear a question you do n't know the answer to , which gives you something to go study .
Practice Drill # 8 : Listen in on a technical phone screen .
Write up your feedback afterwards , cast your vote , and then talk about the screen with the screener to see if you both reached the same conclusions .
And , of course , go figure out how to solve anything the screener asked that you did n't know the answer to .
Incidentally , I sometimes listen in on phone screens , and I bring a pen and paper , so I can doodle during the boring lulls , where the screener is saying loudly into the speakerphone : " Did you say paren paren backslash slash ?
Or was it paren paren slash backslash slash ? "
I 'll use the pen and paper to experiment with solutions to some of their questions , as well as take notes on the screen .
Interviewing is absolutely one of the best ways to improve your own technical skills .
For one thing , it requires you to invent and present challenging technical questions , then conduct deep - dive discussions of them with interview candidates .
That 's just plain good exercise .
For another , you can ask candidates to teach you new stuff .
For instance , if they did a Masters thesis or Ph.D. on some exotic - sounding CS subject , you might have them try to explain it to you .
If they do a great job , well , you 'll have learned something new !
And if they do a terrible job , you 'll at least have learned something interesting about the candidate -- namely , that they can't explain something they know well , which implies that they may not understand it very well .
It does n't necessarily have to be a thesis topic .
You might run into a domain expert in a domain similar to one you 're familiar with .
For instance , if you 're interviewing an SQL Server expert , you might ask how SQL Server handles a particularly thorny problem you 've experienced with Oracle .
Or if you 're interviewing someone who 's a fan of a technology you have n't heard of , you might ask them to give you a high - level overview of it .
Interviews can basically be free education , and you might as well take advantage of them .
Practice Drill # 9 : Conduct a technical interview with a candidate who 's an expert in some field you do n't know much about .
Ask them to explain it to you from the ground up , assuming no prior knowledge of that field .
Try hard to follow what they 're saying , and ask questions as necessary .
Sometimes their explanation is just gobbledygook , and I do n't get much out of it .
That 's usually because it requires more math than I have handy , so I 'll spend a day hitting the math books after that happens .
( It 's never enough , but it 's good practice anyway . )
Sometimes you 'll be able to follow them , ramp up quickly on the idea , start probing in complex corners , and wind up with a really good discussion .
Or sometimes you 'll find the candidate can't answer even trivial questions about the subject , which can be useful data for the interview .
Pair - interviewing is also useful .
All you need to do is listen in while someone else conducts the interview ( although sometimes pair interviewers divide up the questions , or give each other a chance to ask stuff . )
Pair interviewing is great because it gives you new questions to ask , and it shows you new approaches to managing the flow of the interview .
Everyone runs interviews a little differently , and being exposed to multiple styles will make you a better interviewer .
Practice Drill # 10 : Get yourself invited to someone else 's technical interview .
Listen and learn .
Try to solve the interview questions in your head while the candidate works on them .
Nowadays I make it a habit to try to invite someone to every one of my interviews .
Some people do Mock Interviewing to hone their skills .
You just pick a random person and have them ask you an interview question , and solve it right there on the board .
If you fail the question , you have to go read up on that area .
No big deal .
Ron Braunstein comes into my office every two or three weeks , writes a problem on the board , and asks me to solve it right then and there .
( I do the same to him almost as often . )
It 's usually a problem that he just finished solving , and thinks it might be an interesting interview question or programming challenge .
I work through it , then we talk about it and compare our approaches .
You should do this once in a while .
It 's good for you .
Sometimes you 'll do great , and sometimes you 'll get stuck .
Just like in real life .
Practice Drill # 11 : Find a buddy for trading practice questions .
Ask each other programming questions , alternating weeks .
Spend 10 or 15 minutes working on the problem , and 10 or 15 minutes discussing it ( finished or not . )
If your buddy 's questions are always too hard , my recommendation is to find yourself a new buddy .
It can be a bit deflating when your buddy votes not to hire you 3 or 4 weeks in a row .
One last interviewing - related drill : make sure you can solve any coding question that another interviewer asks .
I overhear interview questions occasionally that I 'm not immediately sure how to solve .
I file them away and go implement them later in the week .
Practice Drill # 12 :
When you hear any interview coding question that you have n't solved yourself , go back to your desk and mail the question to yourself as a reminder .
Solve it sometime that week , using your favorite programming language .
If you struggle with it , e.g. it takes more than an hour , you may have a gap in your knowledge , which is wonderful , because now you know and can fix it .
However , it might also mean that the interview question is too hard .
You might bring it to a Bar Raiser or another experienced interviewer and ask them if they think it 's a reasonable SDE interview question .
Wrap - up I was planning on trying to make up 20 practice drills , but the effort basically killed this blog entry .
It sat unfinished for over 2 months .
Instead , I 'll stop at a dozen , and maybe mention some more drills in a future blog .
There are plenty of others , but hopefully this gives you a few to work on .
If you have ideas for other practice drills , feel free to submit them in the comments section .
I 'm willing to try anything that 's worked well for others .
( Published Jan 23 , 2005 ) Comments Dave Thomas has a long blog thread on practicing programming .
This gives 21 suggested exercises , or ' code kata ' .
http://blogs.pragprog.com/cgi-bin/pragdave.cgi/Practices/Kata
On the music side of things , I 'm learning to play piano , and teaching myself because two years of lessons did nothing but lighten my wallet .
It seems that practicing techniques are still fairly hotly debated even now ; some people maintain that non-musical drills such as those by Hanon and Czerny are worthless ; it 's better to use , say , Bach Two Part Inventions or Chopin Etudes , because technique should never be divorced from music .
Personally I found this free online book immensely helpful : http://members.aol.com/chang8828/contents.htm
( He has a good reviews second , where he recommends other materials ; I went with Seymour Fink 's book , and I 'm about to buy the ' Freeing The Caged Bird ' video . )
Also , I found this book reading this book right now , which combines elements of Tai Chi and Feldenkrais and an apparent unification of the arm - weight / finger - movement schools .
The author is a bit full of himself , but the first couple of chapters ( on the bus this morning ) were good .
I guess I should blog this ...

The hydrogen economy is not a futuristic concept .
The U.S. Department of Energy 's 2006 Advance Energy Initiative calls for competitive ethanol from plant sources by 2012 and a good selection of hydrogen - powered fuel cell vehicles by 2020 .
Researchers at Virginia Tech , Oak Ridge National Laboratory ( ORNL ) , and the University of Georgia propose using polysaccharides , or sugary carbohydrates , from biomass to directly produce low - cost hydrogen for the new hydrogen economy .
According to the DOE , advances are needed in four areas to make hydrogen fuel an economical reality for transportation – production , storage , distribution , and fuel cells .
Most industrial hydrogen currently comes from natural gas , which has become expensive .
Storing and moving the gas , whatever its source , is costly and cumbersome , and even dangerous .
And there is little infrastructure for refueling a vehicle .
" We need a simple way to store and carry hydrogen energy and a simple process to produce hydrogen , said Y.- H. Percival Zhang , assistant professor of biological systems engineering at Virginia Tech .
Using synthetic biology approaches , Zhang and colleagues Barbara R. Evans and Jonathan R. Mielenz of ORNL and Robert C. Hopkins and Michael W.W. Adams of the University of Georgia are using a combination of 13 enzymes never found together in nature to completely convert polysaccharides ( C6H10O5 ) and water into hydrogen when and where that form of energy is needed .
This " synthetic enzymatic pathway " research appears in the May 23 issue of PLoS ONE , the online , open - access journal from the Public Library of Science ( www.plosone.org).
Polysaccharides like starch and cellulose are used by plants for energy storage and building blocks and are very stable until exposed to enzymes .
Just add enzymes to a mixture of starch and water and " the enzymes use the energy in the starch to break up water into only carbon dioxide and hydrogen , " Zhang said .
A membrane bleeds off the carbon dioxide and the hydrogen is used by the fuel cell to create electricity .
Water , a product of that fuel cell process , will be recycled for the starch - water reactor .
Laboratory tests confirm that it all takes place at low temperature -- about 86 degrees F -- and atmospheric pressure .
The vision is for the ingredients to be mixed in the fuel tank of your car , for instance .
A car with an approximately 12 - gallon tank could hold 27 kilograms ( kg ) of starch , which is the equivalent of 4 kg of hydrogen .
The range would be more than 300 miles , Zhang estimates .
One kg of starch will produce the same energy output as 1.12 kg ( 0.38 gallons ) of gasoline .
Since hydrogen is gaseous , hydrogen storage is the largest obstacle to large - scale use of hydrogen fuel .
The Department of Energy 's long - term goal for hydrogen storage was 12 mass percent , or 0.12 kg of hydrogen per one kg of container or storage material , but such technology is not available , said Zhang .
Using polysaccharides as the hydrogen storage carrier , the research team achieved hydrogen storage capacity as high as 14.8 mass percent , they report in the PLOS article .
The idea began as a theory .
The research was based on Zhang 's previous work pertaining to cellulosic ethanol production and the ORNL and University of Georgia researchers ' work with enzymatic hydrogen production .
UGA Distinguished Professor Adams is co-author of the first enzymatic hydrogen paper in Nature Biotechnology in 1996 .
The researchers were certain they could put the processes together in one pot .
They tested the theory using Oak Ridge 's hydrogen detectors and documented that hydrogen is produced as they predicted .
Mielenz , who heads the Bioconversion Group in ORNL 's Biosciences Division , attributed the successful research to a unique collaborative working relationship between scientists , lab divisions , and universities .
" Pairing our biomass conversion capabilities with facilities for studying renewable hydrogen production in the lab 's Chemical Sciences Division was a key to this project , " Mielenz said .
" This also shows the value of partnerships with universities such as Virginia Tech and the University of Georgia . "
It is a new process that aims to release hydrogen from water and carbohydrate by using multiple enzymes as a catalyst , Zhang said .
" In nature , most hydrogen is produced from anaerobic fermentation .
But hydrogen , along with acetic acid , is a co-product and the hydrogen yield is pretty low -- only four molecules per molecule of glucose .
In our process , hydrogen is the main product and hydrogen yields are three - times higher , and the likely production costs are low – about $ 1 per pound of hydrogen . "
Over the years , many substances have been proposed as " hydrogen carriers , " such as methanol , ethanol , hydrocarbons , or ammonia – all of which require special storage and distribution .
Also , the thermochemical reforming systems require high temperatures and are complicated and bulky .
Starch , on the other hand , can be distributed by grocery stores , Zhang points out .
" So it is environmentally friendly , energy efficient , requires no special infrastructure , and is extremely safe .
We have killed three birds with one stone , " he said .
" We have hydrogen production with a mild reaction and low cost .
We have hydrogen storage and transport in the form of starch or syrups .
And no special infrastructure is needed . "
" The next R&D step will be to increase reaction rates and reduce enzyme costs , " Zhang said .
" We envision that in the future we will drive vehicles powered by carbohydrate , or energy stored in solid carbohydrate form , with hydrogen production from carbohydrate and water , and electricity production via hydrogen - fuel cells .
" What is more important , the energy conversion efficiency from the sugar - hydrogen - fuel cell system is extremely high – greater than three times higher than a sugar - ethanol - internal combustion engine , " Zhang said .
" It means that if about 30 percent of transportation fuel can be replaced by ethanol from biomass as the DOE proposed , the same amount of biomass will be sufficient to provide 100 percent of vehicle transportation fuel through this technology . "
In addition , the use of carbohydrates from biomass as transportation fuels will produce zero net carbon dioxide emissions and bring benefits to national energy security and the economy , Zhang said .

EMMY / TONY AWARD WINNING ACTOR MICHAEL MORIARTY CALLS THE OKLAHOMA CITY BOMBINGS , AND 911 “ AN INSIDE JOB ” – SAYS THE BUSH ’S AND CLINTONS RAN DRUGS TOGETHER IN ARKANSAS
Michael Moriarty , acclaimed actor and former star of Law & Order , and such films as Bang the Drum Slowly , Pale Rider , The Glass Menagerie , Hanoi Hilton , and Holocaust just to name a few …
Appeared on the syndicated talk radio show DEADLINE LIVE with Jack Blood ( Genesis Communications Network ) Tuesday February 6th 2007 to discuss his write in bid for US President in 2008 , and his new independent film , “ Hitler Meets Christ ”
Along the way MR Moriarty discussed some of his published opinions and musings about “ Progressive ” politics , abortion , terrorism , science , and conservatism gone wrong in the new millennium .
Moriarty began by detailing the evidence of forced sterilzations and the open eugenics plans of the elite .
He quickly went into geo politics saying , “ The Bush / Clinton cartel , coalition ( are ) doing a Napoleon run on what ’s left of the free world .
They are BOTH progressives .
The Republican party became progressive with Henry Kissinger ; and never looked back . ”
( We assume by “ progressives ” he means Neo Liberals , and Neo Cons )
Moriarty went on to discuss the extensive past of Bush Sr and Bill Clinton in Mena Arkansas when Bill Clinton was Governor .
“ He ( Bush Sr ) wanted to run a profoundly unconstitutional , guns and drugs operation out of Mena .
So he goes to Arkansas and there ’s Bill waiting for him saying Lets break the law together .
The reason it ’s against the law and the constitution much more so than Iran / Contra is that the CIA has a right to raise funds on Foreign soil , and they are obliged to occasionally …
But when you bring in a law breaking outfit of guns and drugs into the domestic United States you compromise the FBI , the state courts , and you just get yourself in the worst possible position . ”
Asked again by Jack Blood if he agrees that Bill Clinton and George H.W. Bush were running illegal guns and drugs , and laundering money out of Arkansas , Moriarty replied , “ ABSOLUTELY , Its fact !
Its total Fact . ”
Host Jack Blood then asked Mr. Moriarty about his writings pertaining to the Oklahoma City Bombings of 1995 .
Blood asked , “ Who Benefited from the OKC Bombings . ”
Moriarty answered , “ The Clinton Administration .
They shot up to a 62 % approval rating ( from 22 % ) Janet Reno kept her job , the BATF kept their Dept. the whole Clinton Admin. benefited from that awful nightmare … .
That ’s why it smelled of a Reichstag fire .
Moriarty went on to add that Muslims were involved in the OKC bombings and that it was covered up by the Clintons et al .
“ There are so many deep lies , those two families ( Bush and Clinton ) that put together what will prove to be 24 years of progressive presidents , because America will have no more right to say no to Hillary Clinton than they did about Roe V Wade .
You have no choice because indeed it is run by the New World Order .
Asked again by Jack Blood to clarify , do you have any doubt the OKC Bombing was an Inside Job ?
Moriarty replied , “ NONE ! ”
He elaborated , “ There were two seismic reports of explosions .
There were no children of federal employees in the building at the time in the day care center , and the BATF were no where to be found .
( According to local news reports , and eyewitness accounts , they were text messaged not to go in that day , but were standing by . )
Asked about September 11th 2001 , Michael Moriarty laid out his theory .
“ My Theory is that Bush ( Sr ) talked to the Bin Laden family in Riyadh .
The Bin Laden family hired the Pentagon , the Bush ’s , to protect their holdings …
They hired them for protection in the first Gulf War .
George Bush says , I am not going to attack Iraq without Probable Cause .
The Bin Ladens say , we ’ll give you probable cause …
And one of their own relatives pulled this off . ”
( He has posted articles in the past mentioning that the UN was also somehow involved in 911 .
“ Actually , word just came in that the Jihad arm of the UN blew up the twin towers of the World Trade Center and half the Pentagon .
A few of the delegates who sit so politely in the UN General Assembly left the building today and eagerly awaited a nightmare they knew was going to happen , a mini-Pearl - Harbor 60 blocks south of them in Manhattan .
They ’re even now thinking that a similar stunt at the UN might deflect the blame .
Reichstag fires are a big attention - getter and blame - thrower .
That ’s my description of their best propaganda war weapon : the blame - thrower .
Oklahoma City was given a taste of that on April 19 , 1995 . ”
Regarding the Dept of Homeland Security Moriarty said , “ Homeland Security , FEMA …
They are built NOT to protect the American people .
They are built to protect the federal Government in case of the inevitable civil war starts . ”
With these statements Michael Moriarty joins a growing list of celebrities ( Charlie Sheen , Ed Begley Jr , Ed Asner , James Brolin , and David Lynch ) who question the Government ’s version of events regarding both the OKC bombings and 911 .
Though we do not agree with all of Moriarty ’s conclusions , “ Islam is a New World Order Gestapo ” Etc… BUT we commend Mr. Moriarty for speaking out about state sponsored terrorism , and agree that an internationalist elite are attempting to destroy the USA from the inside out to create a one world government run by a scientific dictatorship .
While critics may dismiss Moriarty 's statements as those of an isolated
Hollywood type living in their own world , the fact is that 36 percent of Americans believe that the U.S. government aided the terrorists attacks of 9/11 according to a Scripts Howard news service poll .
Michael Moriarty ’s new film HILTER MEETS CHRIST will be screened at the San Jose Film Festival in March of 2007 .
Moriarty stars in the film he wrote and directed playing Hitler .

Jack Blood is available for comment if you should need to ask any follow up questions .
Stanford University officials , for the second time this week , found themselves Friday dealing with an interloper who has managed to pass herself off as a member of the university community for months .
The latest incident involves a woman , identified as Elizabeth Okazaki , who essentially made herself at home in the campus ' Varian Physics Laboratory , sometimes spending the night there , using the computers and attending seminars , according to students .
University officials say they are taking steps to keep Okazaki off campus .
Some students say the situation has been going on since at least 2004 .
" I thought she was just another grad student , but then you talk to her and you realize that perhaps she does n't really know what 's going on , " said Surjeet Rajendran , 24 , a graduate student in physics .
" She pretended to know physics , but it was very obvious that she did n't have any idea what she was talking about . "
Okazaki alternately said she was affiliated with another academic department , was working on an ambiguous project that combined physics with humanities , or was working with renowned physics Professor Leonard Susskind , one of the leading contributors to the string theory concept , students said .
Susskind , in an e-mail , said he knew very little about Okazaki , and she had never worked with or for him .
How Okazaki came to frequent the physics lab is unclear .
Several students said they had heard she used to work for the department years ago , perhaps as a temporary clerical worker .
A university spokeswoman said she could not comment on whether Okazaki had been a university employee .
Whatever the reason , the largely nonconfrontational atmosphere in the physics department allowed her to go unchallenged for years , some students said .
" A university has a lot of weird people , " Rajendran said .
" Some of the faculty are weird , some of the grad students are weird .
So you do n't really know who 's who .
And you feel rather , I guess , rude asking them , ' What the hell are you doing ? '
I guess in that way it helps some strange people hang out without too many questions being raised . "
Undergraduate physics student Brendan Wells , 22 , said Okazaki is harmless .
" A lot of what she does is just use the computers , make tea and just kind of use the space as a place to be , " said Wells .
" I do n't know if that 's because she does n't have somewhere else to go or she prefers it here . "
Wells said he last saw Okazaki in the physics building Friday morning .
She could not be reached for comment later in the day .
University attorneys are preparing a letter notifying Okazaki that she is not allowed on campus while police and university officials investigate her actions , Stanford spokeswoman Kate Chesley said .
" Stanford is a private institution , " Chesley said .
" We have the legal right to bar anyone from the premises , including people we reasonably believe will disrupt or have disrupted operations . "
The emergence of Okazaki comes on the heels of revelations earlier this week that an 18 - year - old Orange County woman , Azia Kim , had passed herself off as a freshman for most of the school year , convincing students to let her room with them in two separate dorms for about eight months .
Vice Provost for Student Affairs Greg Boardman said the university is launching a sweeping investigation into the Kim case , including " seeking to discover where there may be gaps in Stanford 's system of identifying enrolled students . "
Both cases are being investigated by Stanford police and campus officials .
" We consider this very serious , " Chesley said .
She added , however , that Okazaki 's situation was different from the young woman who lived in university housing as an impostor .
" You 're really talking apples and oranges , " she said .
While some physics students described Okazaki as " harmless , " they said her presence could be worrisome .
" It is a little creepy that there 's someone always there , " Wells said .
" Sometimes she likes to talk a lot , even when people are busy .
At times I know it can get a little annoying . "
At one point , Okazaki had to be scolded for bothering the physics theory group , Rajendran said .
" She used to spend a lot of time on our floor trying to talk to people , " Rajendran said .
" That was kind of a pain because it was distracting us from doing work .
She stopped doing that after we sort of very harshly told her not to come there . "
Okazaki also used to prop doors open in the building , apparently because she did n't have a card key , triggering concerns about security or theft , students said .
Hundreds of thousands of dollars in scientific equipment has been stolen from campus science buildings in recent months , university officials said , but all the students interviewed said they were confident Okazaki had no involvement .
Toby licked Debbie 's face to stop her from passing out
Debbie Parkhurst , 45 , said she was eating an apple at home last Friday when a piece became lodged in her throat and she began to choke .
Ms Parkhurst said she pounded on her own chest but could not move the piece .
Toby joined in , jumping on her chest and dislodging the apple , then licking her face so she would not pass out .
Chat shows
Ms Parkhurst , who lives in the town of Calvert , said she was convinced Toby was not playing and was trying to perform his own version of the Heimlich .
The manoeuvre , named after Dr Henry Heimlich , who first recorded it in 1974 , aims to clear airways with abdominal thrusts .

Ms Parkhurst , who works with jewellery , said two - year - old Toby got serious after her own efforts failed .
" The next thing I know , Toby 's up on his hind feet and he's got his front paws on my shoulders , " she told Associated Press .
" He pushed me to the ground , and once I was on my back , he began jumping up and down on my chest . "
Ms Parkhurst is recovering from chest and stomach wounds from Toby 's jumping .
" I literally have paw print - shaped bruises on my chest .
I 'm still a little hoarse , but otherwise I 'm OK , " she said .
" They say dogs leave a paw print on your heart .
He left a paw print on my heart , that 's for sure .
" The doctor said I probably would n't be here without Toby .
I keep looking at him and saying , ' You 're amazing ' . "
Ms Parkhurst and Toby have now been asked on to numerous US chat shows .

The Republican Congress consistently opted to let things just somehow work out instead of providing oversight and supporting consumers .
Keep in mind that big business is on a major PR offensive right now , crying that they are over - regulated and that they need to be dealt a free hand with business .
Sorry folks , but that is precisely what they had for the last few years and they dropped the ball .
Rep. John D. Dingell ( D - Mich . ) scolded the five members of the Federal Communications Commission when he finally got them before a powerful subcommittee last month .
The FCC botched handling of cable television franchising , racked up a backlog of unanswered consumer complaints , and dallied on various disputes between industry rivals with little oversight from the previous Republican - controlled Congress in recent years , the chairman of the House Energy and Commerce Committee said in the March 14 hearing .
Within days , word spread that the FCC was accelerating efforts to complete action on about 150 pending matters -- from regulating cable television service in apartment buildings to settling quarrels over the distribution of telecommunications funds in rural areas .
Some analysts saw the move as a direct response to lawmakers ' complaints .
Porn producer Kick Ass Pictures is getting into the charity game .
The adult entertainment company , which bills itself as " the only porn company in the world to guarantee all natural breasts in all of its movies " says they are releasing a new adult DVD tiled " Nappy Headed Ho's . "
They say $ 1 from the sale of each DVD will be donated to a retirement fund for fired Don Imus .
The film will feature " girls with closely twisted or curled hair ( the dictionary definition of ' nappy ' ) , who have sex for money ( the dictionary definition of ' ho ' ) . "
This promises to be a great leap for society .
In a press release , Kick Ass president Mark Kulkis said , " We see this as a free speech issue .
As an adult media company , we 're especially defensive of free speech .
Don Imus is a loudmouth and perhaps a bigot .
However , CBS Radio was hypocritical in hiring Imus to be blunt and outspoken , then firing him for the same reason .
Fellow broadcast personalities Ann Coulter and Pat Robertson spew anti-gay slurs , yet they are not fired by their networks . "
Hmmm , porno with integrity !
Kulkis says that if Imus turns down their donations , they 'll donate them to the United Negro College Fund .
As Imus proves , a mind is a terrible thing to waste .

Rolf has committed to SVN his latest batch of changes that allowed his Visual Basic .
NET compiler to bootstrap under Mono / Linux .
This basically means that the full cycle for VB in Mono has now been completed .
Rolf 's VB compiler is an implementation of Visual Basic .
NET version 8 .
So it has support for generics and all the new stuff in the language .
Rolf wrote his compiler in VB itself , and he uses generics everywhere , so in addition of being a good self - test , it has proven to be a good test for Mono ( he already has identified a few spots where the Mono JIT should be tuned ) .
The following are from an internal email he sent on Friday ( am trying to convince him to have a blog and blog these fun facts ) :
Friday Results :
compile vbnc with vbc : 4.8 seconds compile vbnc with vbnc / MS : 14.2 seconds compile vbnc with vbnc / Mono / Linux : 15.1 seconds compile vbnc using a bootstrapped binary : 19.0 seconds compile vbruntime with vbc : 1.4 seconds compile vbruntime with vbnc / MS : 3.5 seconds compile vbruntime with vbnc / Mono / Linux : 4.2 seconds compile vbruntime with bootstrapped binary : 4.9 seconds
The memory consumption on Friday was at 475 megs of RAM .
Ben and Atsushi provided some suggestions , and the results for Monday are :
compile vbnc using a bootstrapped binary : 10.0 seconds Memory usage : 264 MB
In managed applications memory allocations are important , because they have an impact on performance .
Also notice that memory usage as reported by the Mono default profiler , means all the memory allocation .
The actual working set is much smaller , since the GC will reuse all unused memory .
Atsushi also has a few tune - ups to the string class that reduces plenty of the extra allocations that the compiler was incurring into .
To bootstrap your own VBNC compiler , get the vbnc module , then go into the vbnc / bin directory , and run make bootstrap .
Bonus : in addition to bootstrapping itself , the compiler can now compile the Microsoft .
VisualBasic runtime ( the new version is written in VB.
NET as well ) .
And can do a full bootstrap with the new runtime as well .
Although binaries compiled with Microsoft's VB.NET compiler would run unmodified on Linux , it was not possible to use VB code in ASP .
NET applications ( as those get compiled on the first page hit ) or if developers wanted to debug and tune up a few things on their target Linux / OSX machine .
In the next few weeks we hope to have this packaged .

A dramatic last - minute deal drawn up by the EU may mark the end of the US government 's control of the internet .
The UK , acting as European representative , stunned delegates from around the world during a late - night session on Wednesday when it produced a series of paragraphs that effectively outlined the end of the US - created internet infrastructure .
It called for a " new co-operation model " that would not only oversee public policy matters but also create procedures for changing the internet 's " root zone file " , managers of country domains ( such as .uk or .de ) , create a new arbitration service for the internet , and produce rules to cover the domain name system ( DNS ) .
In essence , a new version of the current overseeing body ICANN and an end to the US government 's overall control of the DNS .
The US was scathing about the proposals , within minutes telling delegates that it " ca n't in any way allow any changes " that would prevent it from having overall control of the internet .
The next day , the US ambassador David Gross remained equally unimpressed .
" It seems to me to be a potentially historic shift in policy by the European Union - to be a much more top - down , ' governments should control technical aspects of the Internet ' approach , " he told us .
" Something that as you know is not the policy of the United States . "
Likeminded group
But the proposal is there and the UK explained it was intended to help parties from both ends of the spectrum reach agreement .
Even so , that aim looked shaky until a second surprise move when Thursday 's late - night meeting was adjourned early for the EU to review bridging proposals provided by Brazil which opened the way for a worldwide consensus .
Brazil , along with Iran , Cuba , China and others has created an impromptu " Likeminded Group " at the PrepCom3 meeting in Geneva that has continually insisted on the removal of US control .
Brazil 's ambassador , Antonio Porto , outlined his perspective to us : " It is not a question of being anti-ICANN , it 's about having a very clear and open and democratic and inclusive mechanism of overview of certain functions that today are performed by ICANN with no kind of supervision . "
The UN 's special adviser for internet governance , Nitin Desai , told us that the issue of control was particularly stark for developing nations , where the internet is not so much an entertainment or e-commerce medium but a vital part of the country 's infrastructure .
" I'm New Jersey Governor Jon Corzine , and I should be dead . "
That 's how Corzine starts off a public service announcement to remind people to buckle up .
Corzine is the current poster boy for bad seatbelt behavior :
He was n't buckled up when his SUV - which was traveling at 91 MPH - crashed on April 12 , and he was critically injured , breaking many bones and lost half his blood .
He remained on a ventilator for many days and required a number of surgeries .
Corzine mentions all of that during the PSA , and credits the medical care he got with saving his life .
The AP reports that he worked with the National Highway Traffic Safety Administration on the message .
There are cutaways of photos of the wrecked SUV and the last shot of the ad shows him walking away , with his crutches .
What do you think of the ad ?
We think the ad is effective , but one thing to keep in mind is that Corzine 's extraordinary medical care may have been prompted by his position and power .
Corzine has repeatedly admitted that he " set a very bad example " and expressed appreciation for a second lease on life ; he also paid the $ 46 fine for not buckling up .
The NHTSA also has a " Click It or Ticket " campaign .

Facebook WASHINGTON 
While Congress and the White House remain divided over what to do with the estimated 12 million illegal immigrants living in the USA , a new poll shows the American public appears to have reached a consensus on the question .
A USA TODAY / Gallup
Poll taken last weekend found that 78 % of respondents feel people now in the country illegally should be given a chance at citizenship .
Sen. Edward Kennedy , D - Mass. , who is drafting legislation to grant illegal immigrants an opportunity to stay in the USA , said : " As with so many issues , the American people are ahead of Washington on immigration reform .
They know that only a plan that offers a path to earned citizenship will fix our broken system . "
Disagreements about the fate of the nation 's illegal residents were a major factor in the deadlock that kept Congress from enacting an immigration bill last year , despite the support of key Democratic and Republican leaders , as well as President Bush .
The president and members of his Cabinet , including Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff , have said it would be prohibitively expensive to deport all the nation 's illegal residents .
But many conservatives strongly oppose to putting illegal immigrants on a path to citizenship .
" You'd be rewarding them for breaking our laws , " said Rep. Brian Bilbray , R - Calif .
Supporters of a plan to give illegal immigrants a chance to stay in the USA expect smoother sailing for legislation in a Democratic - controlled Congress .
Both Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , D - Nev. , and House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - Calif. , have said they want to work with Bush to enact legislation this year .
Reid has set aside the last two weeks of May for debate on an immigration bill ; House Democrats hope to act before the August recess .
Even so , immigrant rights advocates have been taken aback by some cracks in last year 's bipartisan coalition .
Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , who co-sponsored last year 's Senate - passed immigration bill with Kennedy , has stepped back from the leading role he had played in the talks as he focuses on his presidential campaign .
Frank Sharry of the National Immigration Forum , a pro-immigration group , told reporters this week that McCain 's absence from talks " destabilizes the debate . "
A leaked White House proposal recommended making illegal immigrants pay a $ 10,000 fine in order to have a chance at citizenship .
White House spokesman Scott Stanzel called it a negotiating document .
" It is neither wise nor realistic to round up and deport millions of illegal immigrants , and the president believes this issue should be addressed without amnesty and without animosity , " he said .
But Sharry expressed concern .
" We 're in a very different posture than we thought we would be , " he said .

Hal Varian writes on affordable housing .
There 's a bubble element , yes .
There 's a congestion - because - of - the - filling - up - of - America ( or at least of much of its coasts ) , yes .
There 's a richer country able to pay more for location , yes .
In , California , there 's yet another unpleasant legacy of Howard Jarvis -- the fact that California levies a uniquely large " tax on moving " that makes lots of empty - nesters very slow to downsize .
And there 's also the transformation of America 's local governments from cabals to enrich real estate developers to cabals to preserve and augment the values of voters ' single - family homes .
Is Affordable Housing Becoming an Oxymoron ? - New York Times :
In the short run , the supply of housing in most areas is more or less fixed .
Hence the price of housing is determined primarily by the demand side of the market - by how much people are willing to pay for housing .
In the last few years , we have seen historically low mortgage rates , which feed directly into housing demand .
In several locations , particularly on the East and West Coasts , where land - use restrictions make it difficult to increase the supply of housing , prices have been pushed up to unprecedented levels .
Whether these low mortgage rates have created a housing price bubble has been a matter of debate ... the idea is that a significant part of the demand for housing is based on an expectation of future appreciation .
The more prices go up , the more people want to buy so as to reap the gains from expected future price appreciation , pushing prices up even more .
It is quite possible that there is some " froth " in the market , to use Alan Greenspan 's term , particularly on the coasts .
But even when the froth subsides , housing will remain quite expensive in those areas .
Can anything be done ?
Some municipalities have started subsidized housing programs that provide various types of assistance to new homeowners .
Unfortunately , such programs just increase demand even more , pushing prices up .
In fact , in an ideal market with a constant supply of housing , a 10 percent subsidy offered to a broad segment of the market would simply push housing prices up by 10 percent ....
In California , tax policy has played a significant role in housing price dynamics .
Proposition 13 , passed in 1978 , limited property tax increases to 2 percent a year for owner - occupied homes .
But when the house is sold , the property tax assessment is based on the sale price .
This means the new owner typically faces a significantly higher property tax bill than the old owner .
Proposition 13 has been called a " tax on moving . "
Indeed it is , since a homeowner in California is much better off remodeling than moving .
It is a lot cheaper to add a bedroom to a three - bedroom house than to buy a similar four - bedroom house because of the tax treatment of renovations as compared with new sales .
For the same reason , empty - nesters have strong tax incentives to keep their houses , regardless of whether they need all that space .
The result is that fewer houses come on the market than would otherwise be the case , pushing prices up even more for the limited stock of housing that is available ....
So what is the answer to high home prices ?
Basic economics tells us that for housing prices to fall we have to see a reduction in demand or an increase in the supply of housing ....
Ultimately , the only reliable way to make housing more affordable is to increase the supply .
But a new house requires land zoned for housing .
We cannot make more land , so we either have to use the land we have more intensively or we have to build houses farther from jobs .
Both of these options are unattractive .
In urban California , traffic has become increasingly congested , putting a limit on how far away from their jobs people can live .
Land use restrictions are tight in many desirable residential areas , and political forces are aligned against relaxing these restrictions .
Imagine someone who scrimps and saves to buy his dream house in an area zoned for one - acre lots .
The last thing he wants to see is his neighbor 's lot being subdivided to build two or three new houses .
Not only would it affect his quality of life , but , even more important , it would also affect the value of his house .
Zoning laws and land use restrictions are unpopular among those seeking less - costly housing since they push up the price .
But by the same token , once a searcher becomes an owner , he often becomes a fervent supporter of such restrictions .
As Pogo put it , " We have met the enemy and he is us . "
The Force is evidently still strong with the Star Wars legacy - Jedi is the chosen " religion " for thousands of people in Britain , according to newly released census results .
The 2001 census reveals that 390,000 people across England and Wales are devoted followers of the Jedi " faith " made famous by the blockbuster films .
Census officials bowed to pressure after a massive internet campaign to include Jedi on the list of chosen religions .
In the great fictional battle against the evil of the Empire , Jedis are depicted as holy warriors , who use the powerful strength of " The Force " to overcome the baddies .
Prior to the census in April 2001 , an e-mail was circulated stating that if 10,000 people put Jedi on the census form , it would become a " fully recognised and legal religion " .
Brighton fanbase
" Do it because you love Star Wars ... or just to annoy people , " the message declared to supporters .
And although the sci - fi sect was not officially listed as a religion , collators did include a special code to register the Jedis .
Out of 52 m respondents , 390,000 kept true to the Star Wars cause .
The figures suggest there are large pockets of support for Luke Skywalker and the gang .
The Jedi response was most popular in Brighton and Hove , with 2.6 per cent of census respondents quoting it .
The campaign may well have encouraged people to complete their forms and help us get the best possible overall response

John Pullinger , ONS
Student support may have helped boost figures in Oxford ( 2.0 per cent ) and Cambridge ( 1.9 ) with more followers coming forward from Wandsworth ( 1.9 ) , Southampton ( 1.8 ) and Lambeth ( 1.8 ) .
The " religion " was least popular in Easington , on the north - east coast of England between Sunderland and Hartlepool , where it was quoted by only 0.16 per cent of respondents .
And in Sedgefield - Prime Minister Tony Blair 's constituency - Knowsley , Blaenau Gwent , Merthyr Tydfil and Wear Valley all showed less than 0.2 per cent of respondents pledging support for the Jedi " faith " .
Unconfirmed reports suggests this may due to Jedi Knights falling victim to their " dark side " .
Director of reporting and analysis at the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) , John Pullinger said support for Jedi had unexpected plus points for the census .
He said : " Census agencies worldwide report difficulties encouraging those in their late teens and 20s to complete their forms .
Light saber sales
" We suspect that the Jedi response was most common in precisely this age group . "
" The campaign may well have encouraged people to complete their forms and help us get the best possible overall response , " he added .
It remains to be seen whether the census results will give rise to planning applications for Jedi bases or open air gatherings being held .
And sales of light sabres could well give a boost the UK economy .
But the big question remains :
Could this mean an invite for Yoda , the Jedi Master , to give BBC Radio 4's Thought For The Day ?
Manners suggest when corresponding with a financial firm regarding sagging tech stock prices , it 's best to avoid threatening a senior officer with his fiery end at the hands of the Prince of Darkness .
More importantly , sending a disarmed pipe bomb to emphasize your point is — while often compelling — frowned upon in high society .
John Tomkins , a machinist in a Dubuque , Iowa manufacturing company , has been arrested today for ignoring these basic rules of charm school .
Federal agents believe they have apprehended the so - called " Bishop Bomber , " who has mailed more than a dozen threatening letters to financial institutions since 2005 .
The Bishop 's uncouth investment proposals usually involved references to heaven and hell and demanding stocks be adjusted to his wacky satisfaction .
In January , the Bishop had sent parcels to investment firms Janas Small Cap and American Century .
Each package was booby - trapped with a pipe bomb intentionally disarmed by disconnected wire to the firing circuit , but otherwise fully functional .
Inside each package was a typewritten letter containing the message " BANG !! YOU " RE DEAD . "
The Bishop 's apparent strategy : having suitably grabbed the recipient 's attention , tell the investors further along the letter there would be a rally over three consecutive days in early February in technology and entertainment company Navarre Corp stock .
Sixteen other letters were sent to investment companies since May 2005 postmarked from a suburb in Chicago and in Milwaukee .
Several of these demanded the stock of computer networking company 3 Com be raised to $ 6.66 .
On Oct. 25 , 2005 , a letter to an investment company executive contained a picture of the exec 's house with the words " DO YOU KNOW WHO LIVES HERE ? I DO " and " REMEMBER COMS 6.66 10/31/2005 " written on it .
3 Com 's third quarter results had shares trading at $ 3.82 , suggesting The Bishop was n't thinking critically about this .
Perhaps a bit eccentrically , one could venture .
Reports obtained by the US Securities and Exchange Commission identified Tomkins as the only individual investor holding interests in 3Com and Navarre that would have increased in value had the securities moved in the Biblical direction demanded .
The US Attorney of the Northern District of Illinois reports on April 11 , agents conducting surveillance of Tomkins in Dubuque observed him driving a red 1993 Chevrolet Lumina with an interior matching what was visible in the photograph of the investment executive 's home .
The complaint also lists handwriting samples from Tomkins bank signature card , mortgage , and employment documents that allegedly match handwriting on envelopes from The Bishop .
Sales records show PVC pipes and caps consistent with materials used in the pipe bombs were purchased using Tomkins ' credit card .
Tomkins was charged today with one count of mailing a threatening communications with intent to extort and once count of possession of an unregistered destructive device .
He will appear before US Magistrate Judge Sidney Schenkier in the District Court in Chicago .
The first charge carries a maximum sentence of 20 years in prison and the second a maximum of 10 years .
Both carry a maximum fine of $ 250,000 .
So remember your good manners , readers .
Always be polite and register your pipe bomb before sending it to your favorite tech company . ®
I do n’t usually read The Nation , but John Nicholas has a post up over there today talking about a group of conservatives who have finally stopped drinking the Bush Administration Kool - Aid :
Just imagine if one of the leading candidates for the Democratic presidential nomination endorsed this radical agenda : â€ ¢
End the use of military commissions to prosecute crimes .
â€¢ Prohibit the use of secret evidence or evidence obtained by torture .
â€¢ Prohibit the detention of American citizens as enemy combatants without proof .
â€¢ Restore habeas corpus for alleged alien combatants .
â€¢ End National Security Agency warrantless wiretapping .
â€¢ Empower Congress to challenge presidential signing statements .
â€¢
Bar executive use of the state secret privilege to deny justice .
â€¢ Prohibit the President from collaborating with foreign governments to kidnap , detain of torture persons abroad .
â€¢ Amend the Espionage Act to permit journalists to report on classified national security matters without threat of persecution .
â€¢ Prohibit of the labeling of groups or individuals in the U.S. as global terrorists based on secret evidence .
The group that ’s advocating this agenda is n’t a bunch of leftists , they are n’t even cranky libertarians , they are some of the biggest names in the conservative movement :
The group that ’s advancing this so - called “ American Freedom Agenda ” is chaired by Bruce Fein , a former Nixon administration aide who served as deputy attorney general under President Reagan and who helped to formulate some of the serious — pre-blue dress — arguments for impeaching Bill Clinton .
Fein is joined by former Georgia Republican Congressman Bob Barr , veteran conservative fund - raiser Richard Viguerie and David Keene , the former aide to Bob Dole who for many years has served as chairman of the American Conservative Union .
(…)
The American Freedom Agenda campaign is the vehicle that these conservatives have established , with a self - described twofold mission : “ the enactment of a cluster of statutes that would restore the Constitution ’s checks and balances as enshrined by the Founding Fathers ; and , making the subject a staple of political campaigns and of foremost concern to Members of Congress and to voters and educators .
Especially since 9/11 , the executive branch has chronically usurped legislative or judicial power , and has repeatedly claimed that the President is the law .
The constitutional grievances against the White House are chilling , reminiscent of the kingly abuses that provoked the Declaration of Independence . ”
As refreshing as it is to see conservatives who recognize the libertarian roots of the American Constitution and the fact that the Bush Administration has assumed for itself powers that even King George did n’t have , it would be more refreshing if the leaders of the Republican and Democratic Parties signed on to this agenda .
So far , though , only own Presidential candidate has joined them :
The agenda was launched two weeks ago .
So far , one candidate has expressed support it : Texas Congressman Ron Paul , the libertarian Republican who explains that : “ [ They ] say that the executive branch is always hungry .
That ’s why it ’s up to the people , up to the congress to reign in the power of the executive branch . ”
Good for you , Congressmen Paul .
How about the rest of the candidates ?
John ?
Rudy ?
Mitt ?
We ’re waiting for your answer .
At Escala , a condominium project in Seattle , a quarter of the 270 units have double master bedrooms , said John Midby , a partner in the development .
In St. Louis County , Dennis Hayden , president of Hayden Homes , said that each of the 30 detached homes in his latest planned community would have two separate - but - equal bedroom suites .
Kristen Scott , an architect in Seattle , said about one - third of her empty nester clients asked for separate bedrooms , which can cost a few thousand dollars to more than $ 100,000 .
In Honolulu , Nancy Peacock , an architect , said her clients increasingly requested “ punees , ” as daybeds are known in Hawaii — sometimes on the lanai , the covered porch of the house .
In St. Louis , Carol Wall , president of Mitchell Wall Architects , said that three or four years ago her company began “ doing a lot of these little rooms off the master bedroom where the snorer would go . ”
More recently , couples , including some in their 30s , have started asking for two master suites , “ and we do n’t ask any questions , ” Ms. Wall said .
Not everyone wants to talk about it .
Many architects and designers say their clients believe there is still a stigma to sleeping separately .
Some developers say it is a delicate issue and call the other bedroom a “ flex suite ” for when the in - laws visit or the children come home from college .
Charles Brandt , an interior designer in St. Louis , said , “ The builder knows , the architect knows , the cabinet maker knows , but it ’s not something they like to advertise because right away people will think something is wrong ” with the marriage .

An interior designer in Chicago moved into her son ’s bedroom when he went off to college .
“ Separate bedrooms are de rigueur for us , ” she said , adding that she and her husband sleep together on the weekends .
The couple asked that their names not be published .
Fred Tobin , a builder in North Canton , Ohio , is friends of a prominent couple in Columbus whose house was remodeled with two master bedrooms .
The wife sleeps on one side of the house , the husband on the other .
“ It ’s a hush - hush thing , ” Mr. Tobin said .
“ The husband travels a lot , all the time , and he comes home late , and he wants to be able to check his e-mail and go to bed without waking her up . ”

This week our kids smoothies are going on trial in a few branches of McDonalds in the North East .
We 're excited about this as it means we get more fruit in front of kids , but we also know some people may feel a bit funny about us being there , so we wanted to share our thinking .
Basically , if there is one thing we like doing it 's getting more fruit into people , especially kids .
But , depressingly , more than 90 % of kids in the UK do not get their recommended daily intake of fruit .
So in our own small way we want to help change that ( for example , that 's why we 've put our kids smoothies into schools at a discounted rate to make them more affordable ) .
So when McDonalds asked us recently if we would like to trial our kids smoothies in some of their stores we decided to do it .
It was n't a decision we took lightly , we even held a meeting for the whole company one lunchtime to get people 's thoughts on whether we should or not .
And the result was we decided that making our kids smoothies available in McDonalds was the right thing to do , both for our business and for our drinkers - more kids would get the opportunity to eat more fruit .
And in our world that is a very good thing .
We 'll keep you posted with how it goes .
And we 'd love to hear your thoughts .

What is this ?
Updated 10.3.2007
I set out to determine just how much money I could lose by trusting SPAM .
What if I purchased 1000 shares of stock from EVERY stock tip mentioned in a SPAM email ?
Could we all really be missing out on a great opportunity ?
Of course , I do n't have the money to actually waste on an experiment like this .
I made this little web site to keep track of the value of those stocks ... without my actually purchasing anything .
In other words I have n't bought any of the stocks listed here .
This is just pretend .
BUT if I did actually buy them , this is how much money I could be making or losing as of today .
In no way am I suggesting that anyone actually spend money on these stocks , or any others .
Instead I insist you spend it on good food , drink and friends .
These numbers are very nearly real time .
Stop by whenever you like to see how my portfolio is doing .
Note : I have started a new round of data .
My old data is now archived here .
I lost nearly everything in 2005 and 2006 .
Lets see how well 2007 / 2008 will treat me .

BBC News , Washington
The US government warned not to draw sweeping conclusions
Participants in special programmes were just as likely to have sex a few years later as those who did not attend .
In the past few years of Republican Party control of Congress , the spending on no - sex - before - marriage education has risen from $ 10 m to $ 176 m a year .
Critics have repeatedly said the programmes are not working .
They say the money would be better off spent on a comprehensive sex education that would include abstinence .
Conclusions
Social conservatives have long believed that teaching adolescents about sexuality and contraception could encourage them to have sex .
They would rather promote abstinence until marriage .
The students in this study , which was ordered by Congress , came from a range of big cities across the United States , such as Milwaukee and Miami and from rural communities in Virginia and Mississippi .
They were 11 and 12 years old when they entered the abstinence programmes , which lasted one to two years .
The researchers also looked at the behaviour of their peers from the same communities who did not attend the classes .
The findings show that those who attended first had sex at about the same age as their peers - at 14 years and nine months .
The Bush administration has warned against drawing sweeping conclusions from the study .
But by week ’s end it was clear that the president ’s idea of cooperation was purely cosmetic .
At hearings last week , the administration made it clear that it merely wanted Congress to legalize President Bush ’s illegal actions — to amend the law to negate the court ’s ruling instead of creating a system of justice within the law .
As for the Geneva Conventions , administration witnesses and some of their more ideologically blinkered supporters in Congress want to scrap the international consensus that no prisoner may be robbed of basic human dignity .
The hearings were a bizarre spectacle in which the top military lawyers — who had been elbowed aside when the procedures at Guantánamo were established — endorsed the idea that the prisoners were covered by the Geneva Convention protections .
Meanwhile , administration officials and obedient Republican lawmakers offered a lot of silly talk about not coddling the masterminds of terror .
The divide made it clear how little this all has to do with fighting terrorism .
Undoing the Geneva Conventions would further endanger the life of every member of the American military who might ever be taken captive in the future .
And if the prisoners scooped up in Afghanistan and sent to Guantánamo had been properly processed first — as military lawyers wanted to do — many would never have been kept in custody , a continuing reproach to the country that is holding them .
Others would actually have been able to be tried under a fair system that would give the world a less perverse vision of American justice .
The recent disbanding of the C.I.A. unit charged with finding Osama bin Laden is a reminder that the American people may never see anyone brought to trial for the terrible crimes of 9/11 .
The hearings were supposed to produce a hopeful vision of a newly humbled and cooperative administration working with Congress to undo the mess it had created in stashing away hundreds of people , many with limited connections to terrorism at the most , without any plan for what to do with them over the long run .
Instead , we saw an administration whose political core was still intent on hunkering down .
The most embarrassing moment came when Bush loyalists argued that the United States could not follow the Geneva Conventions because Common Article
Three , which has governed the treatment of wartime prisoners for more than half a century , was too vague .
Which part of “ civilized peoples , ” “ judicial guarantees ” or “ humiliating and degrading treatment ” do they find confusing ?
Eavesdropping on Americans
The administration ’s intent to use the war on terror to buttress presidential power was never clearer than in the case of its wiretapping program .
The president had legal means of listening in on the phone calls of suspected terrorists and checking their e-mail messages .
A special court was established through a 1978 law to give the executive branch warrants for just this purpose , efficiently and in secrecy .
And Republicans in Congress were all but begging for a chance to change the process in any way the president requested .
Instead , of course , the administration did what it wanted without asking anyone .
When the program became public , the administration ignored calls for it to comply with the rules .
As usual , the president ’s most loyal supporters simply urged that Congress pass a law allowing him to go on doing whatever he wanted to do .
NEAR the 18th hole of the Bighorn golf course in Palm Desert , publishing tycoon Duane Hagadone laid out his vision for a dream home to his architect .
It would be set high on the bald mountain rising near the green yet be so inconspicuous that he ’d have to point it out even to golf buddies .
Hagadone wanted “ a residence that blends into the mountain , that is very subtle , not a pinnacle seen from all angles , ” his assistants explained to Palm Desert officials as they sought the go - ahead for the subsequent design .
For the record : For The Record
Los Angeles Times Saturday April 28 , 2007 Home Edition Main News Part A Page 2 National Desk 1 inches ; 41 words Type of Material : Correction
Palm Desert mansion :
An article in the A Section on April 20 about a $ 30 - million - plus mansion built in Palm Desert identified a Montana newspaper owned by the homeowner , Duane Hagadone , as the Hungry Horse .
The newspaper is the Hungry Horse News .
The $ 30 - million - plus home would feature a copper roof composed of “ angles and curves ” that mimicked the ridge of the mountain , while its rock walls would be molded from those on the hillside .
The spectacular architectural plans and model so dazzled city officials that they granted Hagadone an exemption from a preservation ordinance that caps hillside homes at 4,000 square feet .
Hagadone wanted his castle to be eight times that size -- 32,016 square feet .
Advertisement
Before that vote in 2004 , one City Council member envisioned write - ups “ in every architectural magazine around the world ” ; another said he ’d already inquired about using this “ jewel in our crown ” as a venue for fundraising events for the local theater .
“ We ’ll all be bragging about it , ” a third council member said .
Instead , the home has brought a load of grief for this city now that it is just about complete .
Visible from miles away and set on a prominent ridgeline , its frame resembles a wayward space station parked amid the picturesque foothills .
Hagadone and his representatives declined interview requests .
But upset residents have flooded the city with e-mails , branding the house “ an unsightly scar on the hill , ” “ a blight , ” “ a monstrosity , ” “ a pimple ” and an “ abortion ” of city planning .
“ We had an untouched ridgeline , untouched , ” lamented resident Larry Sutter .
Advertisement
Residents complained that their views of the Santa Rosa Mountains , which enfold the city like a clamshell , had been ruined .
The bare , unlit peaks are lovely at dusk , silhouetted against the desert ’s twilight hues , and residents particularly dreaded how the house would look lighted up at night .
The outrage crescendoed last summer when city officials discovered that Hagadone had graded 64,000 square feet -- double what the city had approved -- to add unauthorized gardens , a sports court , koi pond and sidewalks .
Some residents demanded that Hagadone rip out unauthorized additions .
“ The natural beauty of the desert and the mountains should be there for everyone ... not just the few super rich , ” wrote James C. Owens .
“ Have the guts to tell Mr. Hagadone NO ! NO ! NO ! ”

WHEN it comes to golf and water -- and most everything else -- Hagadone , 74 , lives large .
Take Lady Lola , the 205 - foot yacht Hagadone had custom - built with what he called the world ’s only floating 18 - hole golf course -- so he could play while cruising around the world with the boat ’s namesake , wife Lola .
Golf tees sprouted from the deck for Hagadone and friends to hack toward 18 buoys his crews anchored at various distances .
A supply vessel followed behind toting other toys : a helicopter and landing pad , several speed boats ( for crew members to retrieve the floating golf balls ) , sailboats , kayaks and a three - man submarine .
“ We ’re a very active family .
We love water sports , ” Hagadone told Showboats International yachting magazine in 2004 .
“ No yacht really gives you the opportunity to carry a full complement of toys . ”
His extensive holdings in his Idaho hometown , Coeur d’Alene , which include restaurants , condominiums and a golf resort , have led some critics to dub the town “ Coeur Duane . ”
Hagadone raised hackles there a few years ago by proposing to replace two blocks of its busiest downtown street with a $ 20 - million garden honoring his parents , but he dropped the controversial idea .

Hagadone was n’t always rich , according to his biography on the Horatio Alger Assn. of Distinguished Americans website .
He dropped out of college to sell advertising for the eight - page daily Coeur d’Alene Press , where his father had risen to publisher .
After his father died at age 49 , Hagadone became publisher , and later owner , of the Press and 18 colorfully named dailies and weeklies in Idaho and Montana such as the Hungry Horse and Whitefish Pilot .
For more than 30 years , Hagadone -- like thousands of other snowbirds -- has traded frigid winters for the Coachella Valley ’s sun and more than 100 golf courses .
His most recent base was in Indian Wells at the Vintage , a country club development that once made news for reprimanding one of its best - known homeowners , Bill Gates , for teeing off in a T - shirt rather than the requisite collar or turtleneck .
In 2004 , Hagadone sold his boats for a reported $ 90 million and bought a plot at the Bighorn club .
The original design comprised five wings interspersed with interior streams and built - in aquariums .
It featured his - and - her lap pools , an infinity - edge pool and several patios and terraces .
Natural light would flood in from more than 110 glass windows and doors -- some as large as 80 square feet , arced like half - moons , or opening at the touch of a button to let the outdoors in .

On the lower , entrance level : a huge garage for cars and golf carts , servants quarters , an elevator and a food preparation kitchen that appears big enough for Emeril , the audience and the band .
As the frame of Hagadone ’s home rose , residents of nearby gated communities and trailer parks dubbed Hagadone ’s home “ the flying saucer ” and “ Neverland Ranch . ”
Blinding glare from the desert sun glanced off the rounded , floor - to - ceiling glass windows of Hagadone ’s office , a round building in front of the main home .
It is “ like a lighthouse with one major difference -- there is no public benefit from its location , ” Jane and Paul Mueller , who live nearby , wrote to city officials .
Only a handful of residents expressed support for the project .
One , Bighorn resident Edward Burger , e-mailed city officials that it would be Palm Desert ’s equivalent of the iconic home of Bob Hope , built three decades ago in nearby Palm Springs on a far less prominent peak .
“ I ’m proud to have it in my community . ”

Bighorn rivals the Vintage and a few other clubs as the desert ’s toniest residential golf development .
“ Ultimately , ” the club ’s literature boasts , “ it is n’t the club you carry , but the one where you belong . ”
So many members drive $ 170,000 - plus Bentley Continental GTs that it has its own Bentley Club .
Bighorn also has an exclusive Starbucks , thanks to the chain ’s former chief executive -- and Bighorn homeowner -- Orin Smith .
Other residents include producer Jerry Weintraub and “ Entertainment Tonight ” host Mary Hart .
A few miles from El Paseo , the desert ’s Rodeo Drive , Bighorn straddles Highway 74 , the mountain route to Idyllwild and San Diego .
A path under the highway allows golf carts to easily cruise between their homes and two world - class 18 - hole courses , huge spa and boardroom - for - rent .
Anteing up the $ 350,000 initiation fee , $ 25,000 annual charges , and $ 1,000 yearly “ golf cart charge ” gets a couple entry into those facilities and the Pour House restaurant .
Late last summer , Palm Desert associate city planner Tony Bagato discovered in an inspection that initial construction blueprints understated the home ’s square - footage by nearly 13,000 square feet :
It was actually 44,870 square feet .
But Hagadone had built beyond even that , grading land for a koi pond , a sports court and gardens not approved by the city .
Now , the home was 64,000 , twice what had been approved .
Advertisement
Hagadone ’s representatives called it a mistake and blamed their initial engineers -- since replaced -- for miscalculating the size .
They submitted permit applications to cover the additions .
On Oct. 26 , the day of the council showdown over the mansion , Hagadone got up at 4:30 a.m. to fly from Idaho .
First stop : Ironwood , the gated community of more than 1,500 residents that lies in the shadow of his mansion , among his most vociferous opponents .
He was met by four representatives from Ironwood in golf carts .
Hagadone “ was n’t lawyered up , ” resident Larry Sutter recalled later , but came alone .
He rode shotgun with Sutter , as the mini golf - cart parade cruised by modest two - bedroom condos and through the backyards of the million - dollar - plus estates that now look directly up at the colossal home .
They pointed out how the infinity pool ’s straight edge wildly contrasted with the ridgeline ’s natural terrain .
They repaired to the fitness center to talk more .
Hagadone said he would get his “ rock guy ” to soften the impact , Sutter recalled .
Hagadone “ certainly had opinions , ” Sutter said , but was “ open and engaging and willing to take these steps , and we appreciate that . ”
Advertisement
HOURS later , the council hearing began , and members were quick to express frustration about their limited options .
“ The first time I approved this , I did n’t think I was approving anything that could be seen over the ridgeline , ” said Councilman Richard S. Kelly .
“ What ’s my guarantee ? ” he asked , in regard to approving the additional square footage , “ because I thought I had a guarantee once before . ”
Once something was built , he said , he could n’t imagine the council demanding the applicant tear it down .
If Hagadone ignored the limits on his original permits , why should the city trust him to abide by the permits he wanted for the sports court and other extra additions ?
Kelly asked Hagadone .
Councilwoman Jean M. Benson questioned why Hagadone should be granted anything else , considering “ all that stuff he ’s done illegally already . ”
Advertisement
“ We take some poor guy that does n’t have a nickel and make him tear down a house and rebuild it because he did it without a permit , ” she said .
Hagadone ’s representatives “ stood up there and blatantly lied to us . ”
City Atty .
David Irwin said the original permits contained no provisions specifying that the house would n’t be visible .
With or without the new permits , Irwin said , “ we have very limited ability to impose conditions on the original permit that was issued . ”
If they granted new permits , however , they could attach conditions that he must modify what had already been built .
Hagadone then addressed the council , telling members that “ we are very proud of the home ” and had n’t broken any promises .
“ I certainly have not ever proposed or commented that the building would not be seen at all , ” Hagadone said .
Advertisement
He said he had “ worked hard ” to make the property as “ environmentally positive - looking as I possibly could , ” investing $ 360,000 in modifications , “ all to become a better neighbor , ” and getting up before dawn that morning to address the concerns of Ironwood residents .
Hagadone urged the council to approve the sports court and other additions immediately , saying he now had large crews working to finish the house within a few months .
He promised to work with a special aesthetics committee appointed by the council if they gave the go - ahead .
“ When you ’re my age , you do n’t want to miss another winter in the desert , ” he said .
Jim Ferguson , the mayor , sided with Hagadone .
“ You seem like an honorable guy , ” Ferguson told the publisher .
“ You ’ve worked well with us , and you did n’t do anything that we did n’t tell you you could n’t do . ”
Advertisement
With Benson dissenting , contending they were being “ blackmailed , ” the council voted 3 to 1 to issue the additional permits .
Some residents now say the home is much less offensive with the total $ 700,000 that Hagadone says he has spent trying to make it less noticeable , including improvements to the home ’s rock walls and changes to the “ Batman ’s ears , ” as some referred to the stonework around the office .
Others think the faux rocks make it look worse .
Gloria Petitto , 80 , whose home was built in 1956 , said she remembered when Bing Crosby , Randolph Scott and other celebrities lived just down the street and “ everybody was family , whether you were a ditch digger , a teacher or an entertainer . ”
Instead of the “ majesty ” of “ God ’s nature ” she could see from every room , she sees the Hagadone mansion .
Advertisement
They have “ no consideration , no care for anybody else ; they just want to be high up and look down , ” Petitto said .
“ I ’ll tell you , ” she said , that ’s “ what money does for you . ”
Last week , the City Council approved an ordinance to prohibit building on or across ridgelines for new lots .
In addition , residents living within 4,000 feet of any proposed hillside homes must be informed while city officials consider approval .
But it appears that exceptions could still be made , just as was done in Hagadone ’s case .
Since selling his Vintage Club residence for about $ 5 million two weeks ago , Hagadone has begun moving into his dream castle .
The lights have kicked on for the first time on the mountain , pouring from all the glass walls .
The sight fills Ironwood resident Waldo H. Shank with fury “ to look up on that ridge all lit up like a carnival each night and know that it was all accomplished by their pushing and shoving and ignoring all the rules . ”

以下は インド方言の一つBrahmi語 インド地方 のBrahmi文字の一覧。 ちょっと母音が多いがおおむ ね 「 あいうえお」の順番に並んでいる。 他のインド語でも同様の順序らしい。子音も「あかさたな〜」に近いように思える。
昔からな ぜ 「あ、い、う、え、お」という順番なんだろう、と不思議に思ってはいたが、
まさかインドに由来があるとは。
先日、 「 シフトJIS を捨てられるか ?：ITpro」についてとりあげたら、tagohさんが「 The day - to - day thoughts - UTF -8は十分かどうか」と反応して、さらにスラッシュドットでとりあげられた。
厳密な話をするならば、 欠点のない文字集合もエンコーディングも存在しないので、 どのような文字集合を選んでもどのようなエンコーディングを選んでも 不満を持つ人はいるに決まっている 。
この文字集合には私の使いたい文字が無いとか、
性能上の問題がどうとか、文字化けがどうとか。
これについては、ケースバイケースとしか言いようがない。
というわけで、各論 。
「 シフトJISを捨てられるか?」について言えば、要旨は
シフトJISでは文字が足りない( ような気がする )
Unicode ( UTF -8) では日本語のデータ量が増える
だったら、新しいエンコーディングというのはどうだろう
というものだ。実際、この記事の流れではUTF-8でダメな理由ってのは、
「 日本語のデータ量が多くなること」、「シフトJISではないこと」だけなので、 それってのは「新しいデータ」についてはさほど問題ではないと思う。
「 新しいエンコーディング」というものは、
エンコーディングを決めて
実装を提供し て
それを広く使ってもらうように働きかける
という手順を踏んではじめて実用的になる。どの段階もそれなりに大変だ。 特に「広く使ってもらう」というのは技術的な問題ではないので、
相当難しい。今時、単にちょっとデータ量が節約できるくらいの理由で
まったく新しいエンコーディングが採用されるってことはほとんど期待できない。
ちょっと考えただけでも、
主要なエディタで対応する
主要な言語で処理可能になる
iconvで変換できるようになる
くらいは必須だろうけど、気が遠くなるくらい難しそうだ。
とはいえ 、ITproくらい影響力があると( あるんでしょ？ ) 、
なんかで間違っちゃってその気になる人がいないとは限らないので、 うれしくない。
純粋に技術的な観点からは、スラッシュドットで紹介されてた
「 新しいUnicode符号化方式」とかは、文字数が多く( Unicode文字集合)、データ量が少ない、という点で条件を満たしている。
本気で新しいエンコーディングを設計しちゃう心意気には感服するが、
実用するのは難しいだろうな。
tagohさんのはもうちょっと違う角度からのツッコミだ。
本当に多言語を扱おうと思えば Han UnificationなどのためUTF-8では十分でないかもしれない、という話だ。
確かにたとえば「骨」の字など、日本と中国では字形が違う。
本当に多言語を扱おうと思えば、TRONコードのようなアプローチの方が良いのかもしれない。
しかし、今度はソートや検索で同一視問題が発生する。
あまり詳しくないのだが、TRONコードを扱うライブラリではその辺の正規化もサポートされているらしいけど、残念ながら誰もが使えると言う状況にはなっていない。
「 カジュアルな多言語表現では字形の違いは気にしない」というポリシーもあるかもしれない。
実際、はてなで中国語ダイアリーを書いている人とかもいるわけだし。
「きちんと多言語を扱うのはエンコーディングじゃなくてもっと上のレイヤでいいんじゃね？」という気もするし。少なくとも「言語タグ」なんてものを導入して状態を持ち込む(エンコーディングがステートフルになる)のはさらなる不幸を招きそうだ。
あと 、Unicodeは文字集合で、エンコーディングにはUTF-8、UTF-16(BE,LE ) 、UTF -32(BE,LE ) があるという指摘もある。
が、実際問題としてまったくしがらみがない状態であれば、UTF-16を選択するのは正気だとは思えない。だって、UTF-16ってば
エンディアン問題がある
しかも、可変 長
という過去のエンコーディングの悪いところを寄せ集めたような存在である。
UCS2で話が済んだ牧歌的な時代ならともかく、サロゲートペアが入ってUTF-16になった時点で
もうアウトだろう。UCS2時代からのJavaはしょうがないとして、あらたにUTF-16を選ぶ理由はない。 でも、なぜかWin32ってUTF-16なんだよね。
では 、UTF -32はどうか。
UTF-32には可変長問題はない。データ量がかなり増えるが、それは無視できるとしよう。
しかし、やはり情報交換用エンコーディングとしてはエンディアン問題が気になる。 個人的には「 BOMで解決」なんてのは信じない。いつもついてるわけじゃないし、 逆にデータにBOMなんてタグが「いつもついてないといけない」というのもうっとうしい。 っていうか、Unicode論者はBOMのうっとうしさを軽視しすぎ。
UTF-32が意味があるとすれば、データの内部表現としてじゃないだろうか。
情報交換用に用いないのであればエンディアン問題は発生しないし。
固定長による処理効率が高いのがうれしい人もいるだろう。 でも、UTF-32を直接扱うライブラリはあまり充実していないように思えるんだけど、
それは私が知らないだけなんだろうか。 内部交換用として広く使われるためにはもうちょっとライブラリなどが充実する必要があるような気がする。
というわけで、個人的な印象としてはUnicodeを使うならエンコーディングはUTF-8で決まり
だと思っている。情報交換用としても内部表現としても。
欠点らしい欠点と言えば可変長なことだけだし、
われわれ日本人は長い経験から、可変長マルチバイト文字列の扱いが実用になることを知っている。
最後に、非常に興味深いブログエントリ、
「 Open ブログ : ◆ シフ トJIS と unicode 」 。
私のエントリも含めて 「 素人の暴論」であり、「 勘違い」なのだそうだ。 私(たち)が素人なのは否定しないけど、その「勘違い」の指摘はあまり上等には思えない。
要旨は
データ長の問題はどうでもよい
文字数の問題も無視してよい(え？)
Unicodeは各種エンコーディングが乱立している
だか らUnicodeは万人の使うエンコーディングにはならない
だから現行のシフ トJISを拡張した新しいエンコーディング(南堂私案 ) を
だそうだ。勘弁して。 我田引水とか牽強付会とかいう言葉はこういう時に使うんだろうな。
まず、要旨のうち最初の点には同意する。二番目はちょっと「勘違い」があるみたい。
三番目の各種エンコーディングが乱立している点については、 困ったものだがUTF-8以外のエンコーディングは情報交換用としては重大な欠点があるので、 事実上UTF-8固定でよいと思う。
最後のものは、世の中に存在するレガシーエンコーディングがシフトJISしかないのであれば、 シフトJISの上位互換と言うのはある程度は価値があるのかもしれない。
このエントリの著者の周辺ではそうなのだろう。
だけど、たとえば私の日本語データのほぼすべてはEUC-JPだし、 世の中そんなに単純じゃない。
まあ、それは良いとして、提案する解決策と言うのが「南堂私案」なるものなのだそうだ。 あいにく「南堂私案」についての生きたリンクがなかったので、 どのようにシフトJISを拡張してくれるのかよくわからないのだけれど、
だから、シフ トJIS:X 0213 でも文字数が不足するということはない。（普通の用途では。）
ということだから、おそらくはシフトJIS:X0213にいくばくかの文字を追加することを許したものなのだろう。シフトJISだとあんまり空間に余裕はないような気がするけど、 まさかGB18030みたいに最大４バイトとかじゃないよね。
それはそれで大問題を引き起こしそうだし。
で、彼( 南堂さん？ ) が見落としているのは、 元のITproの記事も含めて 「 文字が足りない」って話をしている時には、
彼が思っているように「日本語の範囲内で文字が足りない」というわけじゃなくて
「カジュアルに多言語の表現がしたい」というものだろうということだ。
要するに日本語の文章の中でも ハングルやベトナム文字、あるいはアクサンとかのついた文字を表現したいってことではないんだろうか。具体的には最近の「ふぇみにん日記」とかのイメージだよね。
私には 「南堂私案」なるものがそういうのに対応しているようには思えないんだけど。 これで「 Unicodeを使えばというのは素人の勘違い」とか 「南堂私案であらゆる問題が解決」とか断言できちゃうのは、いかがなものだろうか。
私 はUnicode絶対主義者ではないし、選択肢は用意されるべきだとは思っているが ( だからRubyの多言語化は選択肢を用意する設計になっている ) 、
とはいえ、理由もないのに事態を複雑化するのにも賛成はできない。
しがらみが無い状態では、文字コードに関する 現時点で一番ましな選択肢はUnicode(UTF-8 ) であるというのは
事実といってもいいんじゃないだろうか。
で 、Unicodeでカバーできないなにかがあれば、 それはそれ、その状況にもっとも適切なエンコーディングを選べばよい。
新しいエンコーディングを作る必要があることはめったにないが、
もし本当にそれが必要であれば、それをじゃますることはしたくない。 必要だったらUTFCP/UTF-JPだろうが、南堂私案だろうが
サポートできる枠組みは提供したい。
でも、それらは本当に必要なの？
It 's official : monkeys are as obsessed with celebrity and pay - per - view porn as the next man .
A team from Duke University Medical Centre , led by neurobiologist Dr Michael Platt , offered 12 thirsty adult male rhesus macaque monkeys a choice between their favourite drink ( Juicy Juice cherry juice , ABC News notes ) , and the chance to view pictures of their pack 's dominant , " celebrity " monkey .
Surprisingly , the monkeys eschewed the juice in favour of a bit of celeb - watching , but had to bribed with extra refreshment to look at ordinary " rhesus riffraff " .
They were also willing to " pay " juice to cop an eyeful of female monkeys ' hind quarters , something the team dubbed " Monkey Pay - Per - View " .
And on the question of whether Paris Hilton would give up her Juicy Juice for a shufti at Angelina Jolie 's hind quarters , the Duke University scientists confirmed that " celebrity " monkeys were just as interested in fellow celebs as the hoi polloi . ®

Security cameras in Russia 's recently - completed Lefortovo Tunnel captured some pretty wild high - speed car accidents .
The 3.2 km tunnel appears rather cramped , but that does n't stop any of these drivers from traveling at ridiculous speeds , nor has it prevented from being generally careless .
Lefortovo tunnel in Moscow is one of the deadliest tunnels in the world .

Stem cells grew , multiplied and differentiated into brain cells on a new three - dimensional scaffold of tiny protein fragments designed to be more like a living body than any other cell culture system .
An MIT engineer and Italian colleagues will report the invention - which may one day replace the ubiquitous Petri dish for growing cells - in the Dec. 27th issue of the PLoS ONE .
Shuguang Zhang , associate director of MIT ’s Center for Biomedical Engineering , is a pioneer in coaxing tiny fragments of amino acids called self - assembling peptides to organize themselves into useful structures .
Working with visiting graduate student Fabrizio Gelain from Milan , Zhang created a designer scaffold from a network of protein nanofibers , each 5,000 times thinner than a human hair and containing pores up to 20,000 times smaller than the eye of a needle .
The researchers were able to grow a healthy colony of adult mouse stem cells on the three - dimensional scaffold without the drawbacks of two - dimensional systems .
In addition to helping researchers get a more accurate picture of how cells grow and behave in the body , the new synthetic structure can provide a more conducive microenvironment for tissue cell cultures and tissues used in regenerative medicine , such as skin grafts or neurons to replace brain cells lost to injury or disease .
The scaffold itself can be transplanted directly into the body with no ill effects .
“ The time has come to move on from two - dimensional dishes to culture systems that better represent the natural context of cells in tissues and organs , ” said Zhang , whose coauthors on the paper , in addition to Gelain , are from institutes and medical schools in Milan , Italy .
Life in two dimensions
Biomedical researchers have become increasingly aware of the limitations of growing living cells in coated , two - dimensional Petri dishes and glass slides .
In the body , cells are attached to and supported by the cells , other structures and proteins around them .
A cell ’s normal environment is a complex network of tiny fibers , gaps and pores through which oxygen , hormones and nutrients are delivered and waste products filtered away .
Cells move within their natural environments in response to chemical signals or other stimuli .
Researchers are aware that cells on flat surfaces have skewed metabolisms , gene expression and growing patterns .
But the only choices have been glass labware and a product called Matrigel , a gelatinous protein mixture secreted by mouse tumor cells .
While Matrigel does resemble a complex extracellular environment , it also contains growth factors and unknown proteins that limit its desirability for experiments requiring precise conditions .
“ Synthetic biopolymer microfiber scaffolds have been studied for more than 30 years to mimic a living 3D microenvironment , but concerns exist about their degradation products and chemicals , ” the authors wrote in the paper .
Other synthetic polymer biomaterials are simply too big .
Getting cells to grow on them is like forcing spiders to build webs on skyscraper girders .
Zhang ’s nanofiber scaffold , around 1,000 times smaller than the existing systems , is much closer in size to the extracellular matrices that living cells manufacture themselves .
Adding motifs
With the addition of defined amino acid fragments called active motifs , the scaffold can be fashioned to coax stem cells to behave in certain desirable ways - such as differentiating into needed body tissues or migrating toward bone marrow and other natural destinations .
“ What makes these designer scaffolds particularly interesting is that cells survive longer and differentiate better without additional soluble growth factors , ” Zhang said .
“ This suggests that extracellular microenvironments may play a more important role for cell survival and for carrying out cell functions than previously thought . ”
The active motif method could be readily adapted to studying cell - to - cell interaction , cell migrations , tumor and cancer cell interaction with normal cells , cell - based drug testing and other diverse applications .
“ I believe that in the next 20 years all cell cultures will be in 3D with the designer scaffolds , and most textbooks about cell biology will have to be revised when people obtain results from 3D cell culture studies , ” Zhang said .
The researchers are now testing the designer scaffold with a variety of cells , including tooth , bone , heart , liver , cartilage , skin , pancreas , blood cells and artery - forming cells .

I ’ve been trying for years to reconcile my usually - excellent bullshit filter with the idea that evolution is considered a scientific fact .
Why does a well - established scientific fact set off my usually - excellent bullshit filter like a five - alarm fire ?
It ’s the fossil record that has been bugging me the most .
It looks like bullshit .
Smells like bullshit .
Tastes like bullshit .
Why is n’t it bullshit ?
All those scientists ca n’t be wrong .
If you are new to the Dilbert Blog , I remind you that I do n’t believe in Intelligent Design or Creationism or invisible friends of any sort .
I just think that evolution looks like a blend of science and bullshit , and have predicted for years that it would be revised in scientific terms in my lifetime .
It ’s a hunch – nothing more .
Yesterday I read this article in Newsweek about how DNA testing is being used to show that , well , fossils are bullshit .
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/17542627/site/newsweek/
The bottom line is that DNA tests ( which do not set off my bullshit detector ) have shown that you ca n’t really tell what set of bones begat other sets of bones just by looking at how they differed and how old they are .
Apparently evolution is more complex than imagined , and there were lots of ape - people varieties wandering around at the same time .
Some had modern features that they were n’t supposed to have .
The so - called modern features apparently popped up and disappeared more than once , and in more than one species .
My bullshit filter accepts this new information .
I was having a hard time with the idea that some goober in tan pants would dig up a bone fragment in Africa and know it was his own ( great X 1,000 ) grandmother .
It just did n’t feel right .
And now we know , assuming the DNA evidence is solid , that the guy in the tan pants was full of shit .
All that the fossils show is that there used to be ape - people who are not us .
To be fair , there ’s still plenty of evidence for evolution .
It ’s not going away anytime soon .
But personally , I ’m cautious about any theory that keeps the same conclusion regardless of how many times the evidence for it changes .
There was a time when the seemingly straight line of fossil evidence was the primary foundation for the theory .
Now it seems that that straight line was like Little Billy from Family Circus finding his way home from the playground .
And there was a time when it seemed evolution was probably a fairly continuous and gradual process .
Now it seems it happened in bursts , relatively speaking .
And there was a time when it seemed that mutations had to give some sort of survival advantage to endure , and now scientists believe that is n’t necessarily true .
And if this is n’t enough to spike my blog hit count , I should add that the first person to explain that science continuously revises itself -- and that ’s what makes it so great ! -- has no free will .
In the early 1990s , large numbers of military personnel were opposed to letting openly gay men and lesbians serve .
President Bill Clinton , who promised to lift the ban during his campaign , was overwhelmed by the strength of the opposition , which threatened to overturn any executive action he might take .
The compromise that came to be known as “ do n’t ask , do n’t tell ” was thus a useful speed bump that allowed temperatures to cool for a period of time while the culture continued to evolve .

The question before us now is whether enough time has gone by to give this policy serious reconsideration .
Much evidence suggests that it has .
Last year I held a number of meetings with gay soldiers and marines , including some with combat experience in Iraq , and an openly gay senior sailor who was serving effectively as a member of a nuclear submarine crew .
These conversations showed me just how much the military has changed , and that gays and lesbians can be accepted by their peers .
This perception is supported by a new Zogby poll of more than 500 service members returning from Afghanistan and Iraq , three quarters of whom said they were comfortable interacting with gay people .
And 24 foreign nations , including Israel , Britain and other allies in the fight against terrorism , let gays serve openly , with none reporting morale or recruitment problems .
I now believe that if gay men and lesbians served openly in the United States military , they would not undermine the efficacy of the armed forces .
Our military has been stretched thin by our deployments in the Middle East , and we must welcome the service of any American who is willing and able to do the job .
This will be the third time I 've started this blog .
It 's difficult to find the words I 'm looking for , and that 's not my fault .
Over the past few years , our language has been commandeered by those who wish to reshape the United States into a nation more easily manipulated than it has been in the past .
Nonetheless , I feel a certain duty to keep trying until I succeed here .
Let us begin .
Again .
I see patterns around me every single day -- patterns which I cannot ignore .
I see the people of America being subtly trained and changed into a nation of slaves .
Our current political administration are using tactics common to raising small children , or children with personality disorders .
I work in a public school , and twice a month , I sit in on day - long training meetings in which the teachers educate one another on the finer points of education this nation 's children .
Some of the presentations that always catch my attention are those given by our SPED ( Special Education ) team .
These teachers have chosen to work with those children who suffer from autism , ADD , and other learning disabilities .
They are often difficult to teach , as they tend to bring chaos into the classroom .
They refuse to participate in schoolwork and even the day - to - day social interactions which other students take to automatically .
One of the most successful techniques in dealing with SPED children is to offer them two choices , where both choices result in the student doing exactly what the teacher wants him or her to do .
For example , a SPED teacher will offer a difficult student two choices when he or she is not getting work done .
The student is told that a ) he can do his math exercises , or b ) he can do his reading assignment .
This gives the child the illusion of choice and makes him or her believe that he or she is in control of the situation .
It is ( or should be ) obvious to the reader that this is simply not the case .
The illusion of choice gives the illusion of control ; the student is pacified enough to do what the teacher wants done .
I see this psychological tactic being used upon my fellow citizens with alarming regularity .
For example , we are told to choose between : * Republican or Democrat , * Left - wing or Right - wing , * Support our troops or be a supporter of terrorism , * " You 're either with us or against us " , * Support the President or the terrorists win , * Vote Republican or the terrorists will rejoice , And on and on and on .
I can't be the only one seeing this , can I ? Another tactic used by the SPED teachers is to create a daily routine with the special - needs students .
Repitition breeds order -- sublty forcing the student to perform the same actions at the same times each day will eventually train the student that this is normal behavior .
Any previous behavior the student has brought with him - or herself into the classroom is eventually forgotten .
In its place : the daily schedule created by the teacher and taught to the student via simple ( yet constant ) repetition .
I see my fellow citizens being trained in this manner as well , through simple capitalistic greed .
We are constantly bombarded by images of people wealthier , prettier and more successful than we are .
Through advertising and " entertainment news " ( which is my new favorite oxymoron ) , we are taught that , in order to get ahead in the world , we need to make X amount of dollars .
We need to purchase Brand X vehicles , Brand Y clothing and Brand Z electronics .
As a result , we work harder , we work more and longer hours , and we do so for less pay .
We are unable to keep up with the demands we think are our own , but are , in reality , force - fed to us through simple repetition via advertising and what passes for " news " nowadays .
Without thinking , we work longer hours in the hope that eventually we will get a raise or a bonus or a promotion .
While we 're waiting for that golden ring ( which rarely , if ever , comes within reach ) , we buy more on credit .
We take out second and even third mortgages .
We stretch ourselves to the absolute limits of our financial capabilities , and then turn on the television and get told that , if we want to be successful , we need to sell our car and buy a Hummer instead .
I live in one of those forced suburbs .
You may know what I mean : Street after street and row after row of identical McMansions , all overpriced , and all within ten feet of one another .
Thankfully , I 'm only renting , but I drive home from work and notice that sometimes , my neighbors will accidentally leave their blinds open , allowing me a brief , drive - by glimpse into their homes and their lives .
Their McMansions are immaculate on the outside -- perfect , weed - free lawns , immaculate paint jobs , and all the right lawn accessories in all the right places .
Parked out front , I see their immaculate automobiles and SUVs , washed and waxed to a mirror - like sheen .
And , when I look in the window , I see nothing .
No bookshelves .
No art upon the walls .
Hardly any furniture besides a couch placed directly in front of the plasma TV they 're probably still paying off .
They 've stretched their credit to the limit , and are unable to afford anything that is n't a status symbol of some sort .
No one smiles in my neighborhood .
No one waves and says " hi " when you drive by .
Everyone has their head down and their brows furrowed , as if the emptiness of their lives and their bank accounts is weighing them down every second of every day of their lives .
They 're all unhappy , and have no idea why .
After all , they bought all the things they were told to buy in order to be happy .
But every time they turn on the plasma TV , it shows them something else they " need " to be successful .
Every time they change a channel , the bar gets raises , and they try to clear the new bar .
Just as the teachers in my school train the SPED students to conform to a normal school day , so do the companies of this country train its citizens to work harder for less pay , go home and forget their troubles by turning on their TV , and drive themselves further into debt by chasing the American Dream others have created for them .
The businesses in this nation have trained the American People through advertising .
The employers have trained us as well -- work without complaint , for there are always others in the wings willing to work for less than what you make , and willing to work longer hours to make it .
You 're expendable .
You 're a failure if your neighbor has a bigger car or TV than you have .
How do you know these things ?
Because you 're told .
Every time you turn on the TV .
Every time you look out your window and covet your neighbor 's belongings .
Every day of your life .
Why are we so easily fooled by these simple tactics ?
Because we 're drugged .
This entire nation is drugged by two things : Television and prescription drugs .
We come home from a hard day 's work and decide we need to unwind in front of the TV .
We sit there for hours , staring at a flickering screen , being programmed constantly by everything from sitcoms to reality television to the news .
After awhile , even this fails to comfort us .
That voice inside us all -- the voice of reason ; the instinct that something is terribly , terribly wrong , begins speaking to us .
But we do n't listen .
It suggests to us that we 're failing at life , that we 're not happy because we 're not doing a good enough job in the Rat Race .
So what do we do ?
We medicate .
Many of us self - medicate through alcohol .
For others , that is n't enough , so we turn to the giant pharmaceutical companies for relief .
How many anti-depressents are currently on the market ?
If you know , please comment below .
Honestly , I 've lost count altogether .
I read a few weeks back that one of the top three ( I can't recall right now if it 's second or third ) causes of death is prescription medication .
And yet we still go to the doctor .
It 's so much easier to take a pill once a day than it is to sit down and figure out how to make life more enjoyable , is n't it ?
And so we get up , go to work , come home , take our meds , and sit down in front of the TV for our nightly programming .
Because it 's been proven in tests conducted over the past fifty years that mind - altering drugs plus simple , repetitious images equals brainwashing .
No matter how entertaining it may be .
In Haiti , plantation owners used to poison the poor with herbs and concoctions which made them appear dead .
Once the victim was buried , they would dig him back up and put him to work in the fields , keeping him drugged constantly so he did n't have enough wits about him to realize he was simply slave labor .
America has been similarly poisoned and put to work , drugged every day through TV ( and it 's demands that we buy more , more , more to be happy ) and prescription drugs to take the edge off our increasingly difficult lives .
We are trained to do two things : 1 . Go to work to make money , and2 .
Go home and be told what to spend it on America needs to turn off the TV , flush the meds down the toilet , sit down and be brutally honest with herself .
We need to stop running from what we know in our hearts as truth .
We need to realize that we 're nothing but serfs for these companies -- slave labor to generate more profit to give them more leverage with foreign corporations .
This is a global game they 're playing , and we are the pawns on their chessboard .
Why do you think we have NAFTA and the WTO ?
If we do n't stop measuring our lives by the yardstick which is rammed daily down our collective throat , this will never , ever end .
The lives we live now will be the lives we will endure until we die .
Each and every one of us needs to stop and think for a moment .
I will warn you : these wo n't be pleasant thoughts , nor will they be easy to swallow ( certainly not as easy as the antidepressents we 're swallowing daily ) .
Our natural instinct will be to drive these unpleasant thoughts from our minds , and go back to the TV .
That 's exactly what they want .
My father always said , " you do n't learn anything from being right all the time " , and he was correct .
We learn only from our failures , not our successes .
If you 've chosen to follow the crowd and keep up with the Joneses , you 've made a terrible mistake .
Own up to your mistake , look into the heart of it , and learn .
Learn what needs to be done to correct the mistake , and learn it to the point that you never , ever do it again .
If not for yourself , do it for your children .
Children learn how to be adults from their parents .
Your children are , as we speak , learning to become a good little serf , whose only real purpose in life is to make the rich richer .
It 's time for you to break the patterns others have made for you .
Free yourself .

Pre-owned Rolex watches have always enjoyed great demand .
However , many customers are aware that Rolex is the most copied brand in the fake watch business .
So , they are afraid to stumble upon the problem of identifying a real Rolex from its replica .
Rolex experts reveal useful tips how to avoid acquiring a fake Rolex watch .
The major attention should be given to minor details never noticed by an unexperienced person - that 's the secret of a successful buyer .
No see - through case backs : Rolex has never produced timepieces with a transparent case back that gives a chance to view the inner life of a watch .
If you see a Rolex with a see - though case back , be careful - it 's a replica .
No skeleton dials :
Only fake Rolex watches feature skeleton dials displaying the moving inner mechanisms of a timepiece .
Even if you 'd like to have a Rolex with a skeleton dial , it is possible only in case of a fake watch .
No rubber parts : Authentic Rolex watches do no include even minor parts made of rubber .
It is equally true about their cases and bands .
No gold - plated watches :
You will not find an authentic gold - plated Rolex timepiece .
The brand 's timekeepers are developed in 14 or 18 K gold .
No Chinese - made Rolex : Although Rolex is a Swiss watchmaking company , you will find authentic timepieces of the brand produced in other countries , for example , the USA , Italy , Venezuela and Mexico .
However , a Chinese Rolex is no doubt a replica watch .
Rolex produces its Oyster Perpetual models in platinum , gold and stainless steel , but never chrome or chrome - plate .
All the Oyster Perpetual watches are provided with screwed case backs .
Rolex President models have 18 k yellow or white gold or platinum cases .
Only fake watches have cases produced from stainless steel or two - tone stainless steel and gold .
Very few Rolex watches are powered by a quartz movement .
Ten percent of the Oyster Perpetual models make up the exception .
As for the other ninety percent , they are equipped with automatic movement of the brand .
Day and date indications are featured only by full - size Rolex watches for men .
Smart customers should avoid buying a timepiece from street vendors .
Buying a pre-owned Rolex watch through Internet dealers also implies some risk .
Still , if an on - line dealer provides the customers with an opportunity to visit his store and examine the timepiece given a warranty , the interested customers may try out their luck .
It is better not to buy a Rolex watch in the Far East or Turkey .
There are really few , if any authentic Rolex timepieces , offered by the stores in these regions .
While buying a watch , it is preferable to pay by credit card , not by cash or check .
In this case you will be able to return the purchase if you have strong reasons to consider it is a fake .
Sometimes it 's difficult to resist the temptation of buying a replica of your favorite brand .
Many customers still have their doubts whether it is reasonable to ' overpay ' for a branded watch when at their disposal there is a wide range of counterfeit timepieces that look just the same as the original .
Yet , serious - minded customers consider all ' pro ' and ' contra ' and make up their mind not to follow the way of self - deception and reject the idea of buying a replica watch .

Poll : 60 percent of Americans oppose Iraq war YOUR E-MAIL ALERTS Iraq United States or or Create Your Own WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
Sixty percent of Americans oppose the U.S. war in Iraq , the highest number since polling on the subject began with the commencement of the war in March 2003 , according to poll results and trends released Wednesday .
And a majority of poll respondents said they would support the withdrawal of at least some U.S. troops by the end of the year , according to results from the Opinion Research Corporation poll conducted last week on behalf of CNN .
The corporation polled 1,047 adult Americans by telephone .
According to trends , the number of poll respondents who said they did not support the Iraq war has steadily risen as the war stretched into a second and then a third year .
In the most recent poll , 36 percent said they were in favor of the war -- half of the peak of 72 percent who said they were in favor of the war as it began .
Sixty - one percent , however , said they believed at least some U.S. troops should be withdrawn from Iraq by the end of the year .
Of those , 26 percent said they would favor the withdrawal of all troops , while 35 percent said not all troops should be withdrawn .
Another 34 percent said they believed the current level of troops in Iraq should be maintained .
Asked about a timetable for withdrawal of troops from Iraq , 57 percent of poll respondents said they supported the setting of such a timetable , while 40 percent did not and 4 percent had no opinion .
Only half the sample , or about 524 people , was asked the timetable question .
The Bush administration has maintained that setting a timetable or deadline for withdrawal would only help terrorists .
Americans were nearly evenly split on whether the U.S. would win the war in Iraq .
Forty - seven percent of poll respondents either said the United States would " definitely win " or " probably win . "
Another 48 percent either said the United States could not win , or could win -- but will not win .
The poll was conducted August 2 and 3 .
Its margin of error is plus or minus 3 percentage points , and plus or minus 4.5 percentage points for questions asked of half - samples .

MOVED TO LIVINLAVIDALOWCARB.COM / BLOG PLEASE UPDATE YOUR BOOKMARKS TO LIVINLAVIDALOWCARB.COM /BLOG Study : Vegans Brainless , But Vegetarians And Almost Vegetarians Are The Smart Ones ?
A rather startling column appearing in the British newspaper
, Senior Research Fellow at the Medical Research Council Epidemiology Resource Center in Southampton , Great Britain , and her fellow researchers observed 8170 adults over the age of 30 who had participated as youngsters 20 years ago in the BCS70 to see what relation , if any , there was to being a vegetarian as a 30 - year old adult with the IQ level of the participants when they were tested at 10 years old .
Of course , the researchers had to rely on self - reporting from the participants about whether they adhere to a vegetarian diet now and 366 of them , or 4.5 percent , allegedly were vegetarian .
Nine of the ones in the vegetarian group were actually vegans and another one - third of these self - described " vegetarians " admitted that they also eating fish and chicken ( technically making them NON - vegetarians ) .
So the actual number of true blue vegetarians should have been 234 , or 2.9 percent of the total group of study participants .
But the researchers included these meat eaters in the group anyway for some odd reason .
Shall we call them " almost vegetarians ? "
Okay , what exactly did Dr. Gale and her researchers find so fascinating about those in the vegetarian group ?
Here are the results of the characteristics of the " vegetarians " in the study :
1. About 3 / 4 of them are female
2 . Over 2/3 had parents who were professional or semiskilled workers
3 . Over 3/ 4 became professional or skilled workers as adults
4. 45 percent have a college degree or vocational diploma
5 . The higher their IQ was at 10 , the more likely they became vegetarian
6 . Even the " almost vegetarians " who ate fish or chicken had a high IQ at 10
7 . Vegans scored much lower on their IQ test than their fellow vegetarians
For those of you playing along at home , here are the actual average IQ scores assigned to each group in the study :
- Meat eaters not in vegetarian group - 95.5 % of the study - 100
- Vegetarian group without vegans - 4.3 % of the study - 105
- Vegan subgroup from vegetarians - 0.1 % of the study - 95
But there 's just one problem with the results of this study .
Actually there are TWO MAJOR problems that I have with the results of this study .
Let 's look at why this study does n't make a lick of sense at all .
- There was NO DIFFERENCE in the IQ level of those who were true " vegetarians " and the " almost vegetarians " who ate chicken or fish .
If it was the vegetarianism that made them smarter , then would n't the meat eaters in that group score lower on the IQ test than their genuine vegetarian peers ?
But there 's an even BIGGER question to ask .
- What 's with the substantial drop in IQ of the vegan group -- the most extreme kind of vegetarian there is ?
Actually , a vegan is nothing more than a vegetarian who chooses not to eat any food that comes from an animal , so why was there such a wide disparity in intelligence dipping below even the meat eaters ?
Is n't that the REAL story of this study beyond everything else ?
Can anyone explain how a meat - eating " almost vegetarian " can have the same IQ as someone who is a real " vegetarian , " but then a vegan is more brainless ( don't
Is your head spinning yet ?!
8 - O
As crazy as this study is , Dr. Gale has her theory about the end results .
" One explanation for the link between higher IQ and vegetarianism may be that brighter children grow up to think more about what they eat , which in some cases has led them to become vegetarians , " Dr. Gale theorized .
Translation :
If you 're smart you eat vegetables and care about animal welfare , if you 're stupid you eat meat and act like a savage beast slaughtering innocent life .
But wait a minute !
What about those brainless vegans ( shall we call them
Interestingly , Dr. Gale and all but one of her fellow researchers who participated in this study are vegetarians .
The lone carnivore in the group was Professor Ian Deary from the University of Edinburgh who said " the link [ between IQ and being vegetarian ] we have found might not be causal . "
Ya think ?
How , Mr. Deary , have you been able to survive all these years being in an intellectually comatose state of mind and then find yourself working around a bunch of high and mighty vegetarians with an IQ five points higher than yours ?
How have you been able to hold your ground in the presence of such mental agility all around you ?
How indeed !
This study appeared in the
Dr. Gale was n't finished with her extrapolation of information that she derived from this extremely suspicious study .
" Although our results suggest that children who are more intelligent may be more likely to become vegetarian as adolescents or young adults , it does not rule out the possibility that such a diet might have some beneficial effect on subsequent cognitive performance , " she retorted .
" Might the nature of the vegetarians ' diet have enhanced their apparently superior brain power ?
Was this the mechanism that helped them achieve the disproportionate nature of degrees ? "
Can you be any more smug and giddy in your rhetorical questions , Dr. Gale ?
I think it 's a bit presumptuous to describe a vegetarian as having " superior brain power " just because a portion of them became educated and successful .
It 's not universally true across the board as I 've eaten meat my entire life ( and PROUDLY so ! ) and consider myself to have above average intelligence .
I graduated high school near the top of my class just a few months after my 17th birthday , finished my Bachelor 's degree with a double major in just three years at the age of 20 , and completed my Master 's degree work while still in my 20s .
How can all of this be from a man eating beef , pork , chicken , turkey and fish ?
Plus , keep in mind that I not only advanced my education while stuffing my mouth with meat , meat , meat , but I also became morbidly obese in the process weighing in at over 400 pounds just three years ago .
Of course , getting fat was n't from eating the meat , but the excessive amounts of sugar and refined carbohydrates .
Now that meat is helping me keep my weight off forever as I am livin ' la vida low - carb .
I eat some vegetables as part of my healthy diet , but I 'm not ashamed to tell anyone that meat is a big part of my dietary habits and is keeping me heart healthy better than a vegetarian or vegan diet ever would have .
The low - carb lifestyle saved my life , so I suppose you could say it was a pretty intelligent decision on my part to go on that plan starting January 1 , 2004 .
I especially enjoyed reading the response to this study from Dr. Rameet S. Uberoi at the University Hospital Lewisham .
His letter to the editor of the BMJ entitled " Intelligent Vegetarians " was too juicy not to share with you .
Here are some snippets of what he wrote :
... Brushing aside the fact that there was no difference found in IQ ’s between those who were vegetarian and those who ate meat / fish , I am surprised that such claim [ that vegetarians are smarter ] is possible !
Surely consuming meat is not all that bad ?
It is already know that incidence of dementia is the same in both vegetarians and non-vegetarians , but who are we to argue with the diets of famous meat eaters such as Buddha , Jesus , Aristotle and even the mighty brain of Bill Gates ... As a meat eater it gives me great pleasure in avoiding problems such as a lack of essential amino acids , anemia and subacute combined degeneration of the cord .
Even the highest rates of food poisoning are attributed to greens based salads .
I eagerly join Denmark and New York in turning to animal fats as industrially produced trans - fats have become the new source of all our problems .
Eating meat is not all that bad after all .
You gotta love it !
Dr. Uberoi , you speak for many of us with your poignant comments about Dr. Gale 's study .
Truth can be ignored for a while , but one day it will need to be acknowledged by those who oppose it .
While this study was a good try at attempting to create evidence of the benefits of eating a vegetarian diet , Dr. Gale , the unfortunate fact of the matter is it was too full of illogical scientific contradictions to be taken seriously .
Would you like my educated advice to you ( that is if you feel my meat - eating IQ qualifies to give you a suggestion ) ?
Go back to the drawing board in your research using that high IQ of yours on something useful for a change .
How about a head - to - head study comparing the impact of a vegetarian diet with a low - carb diet , hmmm ?
Are you brave enough to take on that challenge or are you smart enough to know the results will NOT be in your favor ?
We 'll see who the intelligent one is now !
You can encourage Dr. Catharane Gale to conduct that study I suggested and tell her what you think about this one claiming vegetarians have higher IQ's by e-mailing her at A rather startling column appearing in the British newspaper The Evening Standard cites the results of the 1970 British Cohort Study ( BCS70 ) claiming vegetarians tend to be smarter , female , and have higher positions of authority in society than their meat - eating counterparts .
Oh really !
Let 's just see about that one .
Dr. Catharane R. Gale , Senior Research Fellow at the Medical Research Council Epidemiology Resource Center in Southampton , Great Britain , and her fellow researchers observed 8170 adults over the age of 30 who had participated as youngsters 20 years ago in the BCS70 to see what relation , if any , there was to being a vegetarian as a 30 - year old adult with the IQ level of the participants when they were tested at 10 years old .

" Okay , what exactly did Dr. Gale and her researchers find so fascinating about those in the vegetarian group ?
Here are the results of the characteristics of the " vegetarians " in the study : 1. About 3/4 of them are female2 .
Over 2/3 had parents who were professional or semiskilled workers3 .
Over 3/ 4 became professional or skilled workers as adults4 . 45 percent have a college degree or vocational diploma5 .
The higher their IQ was at 10 , the more likely they became vegetarian6 .
Even the " almost vegetarians " who ate fish or chicken had a high IQ at 107 .
Vegans scored much lower on their IQ test than their fellow vegetarians For those of you playing along at home , here are the actual average IQ scores assigned to each group in the study : - Meat eaters not in vegetarian group - 95.5 % of the study - 100 - Vegetarian group without vegans - 4.3 % of the study - 105 - Vegan subgroup from vegetarians - 0.1 % of the study - 95 But there 's just one problem with the results of this study .
Actually there are TWO MAJOR problems that I have with the results of this study .
Let 's look at why this study does n't make a lick of sense at all . -
There was NO DIFFERENCE in the IQ level of those who were true " vegetarians " and the " almost vegetarians " who ate chicken or fish .
If it was the vegetarianism that made them smarter , then would n't the meat eaters in that group score lower on the IQ test than their genuine vegetarian peers ?
But there 's an even BIGGER question to ask . -
What 's with the substantial drop in IQ of the vegan group -- the most extreme kind of vegetarian there is ?
Actually , a vegan is nothing more than a vegetarian who chooses not to eat any food that comes from an animal , so why was there such a wide disparity in intelligence dipping below even the meat eaters ?
Is n't that the REAL story of this study beyond everything else ?
Can anyone explain how a meat - eating " almost vegetarian " can have the same IQ as someone who is a real " vegetarian , " but then a vegan is more brainless ( do n't come after me again , vegans , I 'm only quoting this study ! ) than the people who eat meat ?
Is your head spinning yet ?!
8 - OAs crazy as this study is , Dr. Gale has her theory about the end results .
Translation :
If you 're smart you eat vegetables and care about animal welfare , if you 're stupid you eat meat and act like a savage beast slaughtering innocent life .
But wait a minute !
What about those brainless vegans ( shall we call them the REAL " total moron " now ? ) , Dr. Gale ?
Are n't they the prime example of people who tend to " think more about what they eat " and yet their IQ results were anything but stellar ?
Can somebody explain this monkey wrench in the equation ?
Interestingly , Dr. Gale and all but one of her fellow researchers who participated in this study are vegetarians .
The lone carnivore in the group was Professor Ian Deary from the University of Edinburgh who said " the link [ between IQ and being vegetarian ] we have found might not be causal . "
Ya think ?
How , Mr. Deary , have you been able to survive all these years being in an intellectually comatose state of mind and then find yourself working around a bunch of high and mighty vegetarians with an IQ five points higher than yours ?
How have you been able to hold your ground in the presence of such mental agility all around you ?
How indeed !
This study appeared in the December 15 , 2006 issue of the British Medical Journal Dr. Gale was n't finished with her extrapolation of information that she derived from this extremely suspicious study .
Can you be any more smug and giddy in your rhetorical questions , Dr. Gale ?
I think it 's a bit presumptuous to describe a vegetarian as having " superior brain power " just because a portion of them became educated and successful .
It 's not universally true across the board as I 've eaten meat my entire life ( and PROUDLY so ! ) and consider myself to have above average intelligence .
I graduated high school near the top of my class just a few months after my 17th birthday , finished my Bachelor 's degree with a double major in just three years at the age of 20 , and completed my Master 's degree work while still in my 20s .
How can all of this be from a man eating beef , pork , chicken , turkey and fish ?
Plus , keep in mind that I not only advanced my education while stuffing my mouth with meat , meat , meat , but I also became morbidly obese in the process weighing in at over 400 pounds just three years ago .
Of course , getting fat was n't from eating the meat , but the excessive amounts of sugar and refined carbohydrates .
Now that meat is helping me keep my weight off forever as I am livin ' la vida low - carb .
I eat some vegetables as part of my healthy diet , but I 'm not ashamed to tell anyone that meat is a big part of my dietary habits and is keeping me heart healthy better than a vegetarian or vegan diet ever would have .
The low - carb lifestyle saved my life , so I suppose you could say it was a pretty intelligent decision on my part to go on that plan starting January 1 , 2004 .
I especially enjoyed reading the response to this study from Dr. Rameet S. Uberoi at the University Hospital Lewisham .
His letter to the editor of theentitled " Intelligent Vegetarians " was too juicy not to share with you .
Here are some snippets of what he wrote :
You gotta love it !
Dr. Uberoi , you speak for many of us with your poignant comments about Dr. Gale 's study .
Truth can be ignored for a while , but one day it will need to be acknowledged by those who oppose it .
While this study was a good try at attempting to create evidence of the benefits of eating a vegetarian diet , Dr. Gale , the unfortunate fact of the matter is it was too full of illogical scientific contradictions to be taken seriously .
Would you like my educated advice to you ( that is if you feel my meat - eating IQ qualifies to give you a suggestion ) ?
Go back to the drawing board in your research using that high IQ of yours on something useful for a change .
How about a head - to - head study comparing the impact of a vegetarian diet with a low - carb diet , hmmm ?
Are you brave enough to take on that challenge or are you smart enough to know the results will NOT be in your favor ?
We 'll see who the intelligent one is now !
You can encourage Dr. Catharane Gale to conduct that study I suggested and tell her what you think about this one claiming vegetarians have higher IQ's by e-mailing her at crg@mrc.soton.ac.uk Labels : BCS70 , Catharane Gale , diet , intelligence , low - carb , meat , study , vegan , vegetarian

The president and the Pentagon now wield the omnipotent power to arrest , torture , and execute any American they label an enemy combatant .
It is impossible to overstate the significance of this power .
It has totally upended the relationship of the military and civilian in the United States .
The assumption of this particular power easily constitutes one of the most monumental revolutions of liberty and power in history .
It is a revolution that every American must confront now , not later .
If people wait until later to confront the expanded use of this power , it will be too late , because by that time it will be too dangerous to do so .
As long as this particular power is permitted to stand , there is no possibility for Americans to be considered a free people .
A necessary prerequisite for restoring freedom to our land is the removal of this power from the arsenal of government officials .
Everyone needs to understand the nature of this power and its enormous significance .
Historically , the U.S. military has lacked the power to arrest , incarcerate , or inflict harm on American civilians .
If Americans committed a federal crime , they were subject to being indicted by a federal grand jury and then prosecuted in U.S. District Court .
The Bill of Rights guaranteed that the accused would be accorded certain rights of due process of law , such as the right to defend himself with the assistance of an attorney , to confront the witnesses whose testimony the prosecutors were relying on , to summon witnesses in his behalf , to remain silent , and to have a trial by jury .
Everyone was presumed to be innocent and the government had to prove the defendant ’s guilt beyond a reasonable doubt .
Those constitutional protections and guarantees were upended on 9/11 , without even the semblance of a constitutional amendment .
On 9/11 the president and the Pentagon assumed to themselves the power to take any American into custody and inflict violence on him , without according him any of the protections provided by the Bill of Rights .
Today , the Pentagon has the authority , on orders of its commander in chief , to send American soldiers into any neighborhood in the country and take into custody any American citizen and inflict harm on him simply by labeling him an enemy combatant in the war on terror . 
Let me emphasize something important here , especially for libertarians , who have long committed their lives to the achievement of a free society :
There is no way — none — to reconcile the assumption of this power with a free society .
In fact , it is the most powerful government power of all — the ultimate power that can ever be wielded by a tyrannical government .
No infringement on economic liberty — hyperinflation , confiscatory taxation , oppressive regulation , or the like — can compare in significance with the omnipotent power of a government official to arbitrarily pick up anyone he wants for any reason he wants and incarcerate him , torture him , and execute him .
Here ’s how this revolution of liberty and power occurred .
After 9/11 , U.S. officials declared what they called a war on terror . 
They said that this was akin to a real war , such as World War I and World War II , despite the fact that terrorism was still listed on the federal statute books as a federal crime .
The war on terror was a global war , they said , one in which the president , the CIA , and the Pentagon would have to fight terrorists all over the world .
Since it was a real war against illegal combatants , the CIA and the Pentagon did not need to heed legal and constitutional procedures .
They were taking off the gloves to keep Americans safe from the terrorists .
The CIA and the Pentagon assumed the authority to kidnap , capture , arrest , torture , rendition ,  and execute suspected terrorists all over the world .
There were a few indictments , prosecutions , and convictions for terrorism in federal court , such as that of 9/11 conspirator Zacarias Moussaoui .
But for the vast majority of foreigners U.S. officials picked up for terrorism , there was torture , indefinite incarceration , and in some cases extra-judicial executions .
Sometimes the torture occurred at the hands of U.S. personnel .
Other times , the torture was outsourced ( renditioned ) to police or intelligence forces of brutal , but friendly , foreign regimes .
Through it all , Americans innocently and navely assumed that the power now being exercised by the CIA and the Pentagon applied only to foreigners , not to Americans .
Engaged in wishful thinking , they were blinding themselves to reality .
As U.S. officials repeatedly emphasized after 9/11 , the war on terror was global in nature , which meant that the military power to wage the war on terror included going after the terrorists right here inside the United States .
The war on terror ’s iron fist unleashed itself on an American citizen named José Padilla , whom U.S. officials arrested on American soil and accused of being a terrorist .
Federal officials did not indict Padilla , prosecute him , or convict him , at least not at first .
Instead , U.S. military officials took control over him and denied him any right to speak to an attorney , family , or friends .
The U.S. attorney general announced to the American people that Padilla was an illegal enemy combatant in the war on terror . 
For three years , Padilla was held in military custody .
In a recent hearing in U.S. District Court , two psychologists testified that , as a result of having been in isolation for an extended period of time and having been subjected to sensory deprivation , Padilla is now too mentally damaged to assist with his own case .
Even though a government psychologist disputed Padilla ’s claim , the case is bringing to public eye what U.S. officials would undoubtedly prefer to keep secret from the American people — a method of touchless  torture that the CIA and the Pentagon have long been employing involving isolation and sensory deprivation .
As Alfred McCoy described in his book A Question of Torture , this particular type of torture technique is specifically intended to cause mental damage to its victims .
The CIA learned the technique from the North Korean communists , who subjected American POWs to it during the Korean War .
What is so significant about the José Padilla case ?
Its significance lies not only in what U.S. officials did to Padilla but also in the fact that what they did to him , they now wield the power to do to every other American .
That is the post - 9/11 revolution of liberty and power that Americans must now confront if they wish to live in a free society .
The president and the Pentagon faced one big problem , however .
While they correctly assumed that Congress would do nothing to stop the assumption of this omnipotent power over the American people , there was still the possibility that the federal courts would declare it to be in violation of the U.S. Constitution .
So it ’s not surprising that they chose someone like José Padilla as their test case , rather than some middle - class high - school principal who was a member of Rotary .
Federal officials knew that Americans would feel no sympathy for Padilla , especially after the U.S. attorney general went on television and announced that Padilla was planning to explode a nuclear bomb in the United States .
After keeping him three years in military custody , the Pentagon released Padilla from the South Carolina dungeon in which he had been incarcerated and transferred him to the control of the Justice Department , which proceeded to secure a grand - jury indictment against him for terrorist - related activities overseas .
Significantly , the grand jury indictment did n’t charge Padilla with the nuclear - bomb scheme that the U.S. attorney general had used to scare the American people .
Why did U.S. officials agree to prosecute Padilla in federal district court instead of continuing to treat him as an enemy combatant in the war on terror ?
After all , have n’t they repeatedly told Americans that terrorism is an act of war , not a criminal act ?
Is n’t that why Padilla was held in isolation in a military dungeon for three years ?
Why would they switch gears by moving him from enemy - combatant status to criminal - defendant status in federal district court ?
The answer lies in the legal strategy employed by U.S. officials , a strategy that ultimately fortified the federal government ’s revolutionary assumption of military power over the American people .
While Padilla was still in military custody as an enemy combatant ,  his attorneys filed a petition for writ of habeas corpus .
Habeas corpus is a legal remedy that stretches back centuries into American and English jurisprudence .
Its purpose is to negate the power of government officials to arbitrarily incarcerate and punish people without just cause .
Placing ultimate power in the hands of an independent judge , the writ commands the custodian to produce the prisoner and show cause for holding him .
If the judge finds that the prisoner is being held without cause , he has the power to order his release .
Under the law , the custodian — whether he ’s a king , a president , or a military official — must comply with the judge ’s order .
The district court ruled in favor of Padilla , essentially holding that in the United States of America the military does n’t rule over the citizenry .
If Padilla or any other American was accused of terrorism , the executive branch had a remedy under the Constitution — indict him and prosecute him .
Essentially , the district court held : Charge Padilla with a crime or release him .
Meanwhile , attorneys for the foreigners held at Guantanamo , who also had been held for years without being charged , were litigating their own petitions for writ of habeas corpus in the federal courts , arguing that they too had the right to be either charged or released .
The government appealed the Padilla ruling to the Fourth Circuit Court of Appeals , one of the most conservative circuits in the country .
Reversing the judgment of the district court , the Fourth Circuit issued one of the most ominous judicial decisions in the history of our country .
Upholding the government ’s concept of an enemy combatant in a war on terror ,  the court upended the relationship between military and civilian — and between liberty and power — that historically had existed in this country .
While the Court of Appeals judgment seemed to apply only to José Padilla , in actuality it applies to all Americans .
On the day that judgment became final , the monumental legal revolution was complete , except for the possibility that the Supreme Court could still overrule the Fourth Circuit ’s judgment .
What did the U.S. Supreme Court do ?
That was another part of the legal strategy that federal officials employed .
Padilla ’s attorneys , of course , fully intended to appeal the judgment of the Fourth Circuit to the Supreme Court , which very well might have reversed the judgment of the Court of Appeals .
After all , by this time the Court had already ruled in favor of several of the Guantanamo detainees and against the government .
Before the Court could hear the case , however , federal officials transferred Padilla to federal - court jurisdiction to be indicted as a criminal defendant accused of having committed criminal acts of terrorism .
Why had the government seemingly changed its position after years of claiming that Padilla was an enemy combatant subject to military control ?
The answer was easy to see :
The government had the Fourth Circuit ’s judgment under its belt and it did not want to jeopardize a reversal of that judgment .
Federal prosecutors knew that if they could somehow prevent the Supreme Court from hearing the case — and possibly reversing the holding — the Fourth Circuit ’s judgment in the government ’s favor would be left standing .
There was one way for them to prevent the Supreme Court from hearing the case .
There is a long - established legal principle that if a case or controversy becomes moot while the case is pending , a court loses jurisdiction to rule .
Federal officials figured that if they transferred Padilla out of military custody , his habeas corpus proceeding would become moot because he would no longer be in military custody .
That ’s why they transferred him to federal - court jurisdiction — to render his case moot and thereby deny the Supreme Court the power to reverse the Fourth Circuit ’s judgment .
The strategy succeeded .
Ruling that the case was now moot , the Supreme Court declined to hear Padilla ’s appeal , which left the Fourth Circuit ’s judgment approving the government ’s enemy combatant theory intact .
 Well , how come they ’re not arresting , torturing , and executing lots of Americans then ? 
Because every government , even totalitarian ones , must pay attention to public opinion , and federal officials know that , under current circumstances , Americans might not countenance the arbitrary arrests , torture , and executions of large numbers of Americans .
But what every federal official , especially those in the military , knows is that they now wield one of the most powerful standby military powers in history : the omnipotent power to arbitrarily arrest , torture , and execute American citizens simply by labeling them enemy combatants .
All that ’s needed is the right emergency  or crisis and this standby power can be unleashed on the American people — in the course of protecting them from the terrorists , of course .
It ’s true that Americans still retain habeas corpus , given that the recently enacted Military Commissions
Act canceled that centuries - old remedy for foreigners only .
( The D.C. federal Court of Appeals recently upheld the constitutionality of the Act . )
Americans would be unwise to rely on habeas corpus , however , to provide them any safety or security with respect to being labeled an enemy combatant and treated accordingly .
As soon as an American enemy combatant files a petition for writ of habeas corpus , the government will quickly file its response showing that the prisoner is being held as an enemy combatant in time of war ,  citing the Fourth Circuit ’s decision in the Padilla case upholding the enemy combatant designation as part of the ongoing war on terrorism . 
Given the long - established tradition of federal courts not to second - guess the president ’s war - making decisions , it is a virtual certainty that no federal court will second - guess the president ’s and the Pentagon ’s enemy combatant determinations .
The courts will very likely swiftly dismiss habeas corpus petitions brought by Americans who have been labeled enemy combatants . 
While there is still a possibility that the Supreme Court will ultimately reject the reasoning and holding of the Fourth Circuit , Americans would be unwise to depend on any such hope .
For one thing , it would take at least a year or two for any case to reach the Supreme Court and be decided , and lots of Americans could be arrested , incarcerated , tortured , and executed within that time , especially if the right emergency  or crisis were to send everyone into emotional hyperdrive .
Equally important , given the increasingly conservative ideology of Supreme Court justices , there is a growing likelihood that a majority of the Court will side with the government anyway .

In this week ’s eSkeptic , we reprint Michael Shermer ’s review of The Universe in a Single Atom : The Convergence of Science and Spirituality by the Dalai Lama ( Morgan Road Books , September 2005 , ISBN 076792066X ) that appeared in the New York Sun “ Arts & Letters ” section on September 14 , 2005 .
Science Without Borders
a book review by Michael Shermer
In a 1987 lecture on “ The Burden of Skepticism , ” the astronomer Carl Sagan opined :
In science it often happens that scientists say , ‘ You know that ’s a really good argument ; my position is mistaken , ’ and then they actually change their minds and you never hear that old view from them again .
They really do it .
It does n’t happen as often as it should , because scientists are human and change is sometimes painful .
But it happens every day .
I cannot recall the last time something like that happened in politics or religion .
Well , Carl , here ’s a bit of good news , from no less a personage than His Holiness the Dalai Lama , who writes in the prologue of his latest book , The Universe in a Single Atom :
My confidence in venturing into science lies in my basic belief that as in science so in Buddhism , understanding the nature of reality is pursued by means of critical investigation : if scientific analysis were conclusively to demonstrate certain claims in Buddhism to be false , then we must accept the findings of science and abandon those claims .
Listen up , all ye who insist on squeezing the round peg of science into the square hole of religion ; if religious claims are not consonant with scientific findings , it is wisest to err on the side of science , which employs self - correcting machinery designed to weed out error , agenda , and bias .
Not only do scientists change their minds in the face of contradictory evidence , they do so regardless of the religion , race , or nationality of the scientific colleagues who are doing the contradicting .
Science is international , or non-national , in this sense , a characteristic His Holiness says is in harmony with the teachings of Buddhism .
“ Because I am an internationalist at heart , ” the Dalai Lama explains ,
one of the qualities that has moved me most about scientists is their amazing willingness to share knowledge with each other without regard for national boundaries .
Even during the Cold War , when the political world was polarized to a dangerous degree , I found scientists from the Eastern and Western blocs willing to communicate in ways the politicians could not even imagine .
In my 1999 book , “ How We Believe , ” I outlined a three - tiered model of the relationship of science and religion :
the “ conflicting worlds ” model , in which science and religion are at war and one must choose between them ; the “ same worlds ” model , in which science and religion are in harmony and one may have both simultaneously ; and the “ separate worlds ” model , in which science and religion are different methods to deal with different areas of human concern .
Since that time , hundreds of books have been published in the field of science and religion studies , which has blossomed with its own journals and magazines , college courses , scholarly conferences , and even an annual million - dollar cash prize for the individual who most contributes to uniting science and religion ( the Templeton Prize ) .
I thus approached this book with trepidation — what else can be said on this subject , especially by someone with no background whatsoever in science ?
Yet , as I read I grew to respect the author , Tenzin Gyatso , the 14th Dalai Lama , who at the age of 6 was enthroned as the reincarnation of his predecessor , the 13th Dalai Lama , in the Tibetan capital of Lhasa .
Born to a peasant family in a small village called Takster in northeastern Tibet , the Dalai Lama ended up in an exile that brought him in contact with many of the world ’s leading scientists .
He talks about his youthful encounters with science , especially his meetings with some of the world ’s leading scientists , including physicists Carl von Weizsacker and David Bohm , and the philosopher of science Karl Popper .
From these encounters , as well as his Buddhist studies , the Dalai Lama found a way to harmonize science and religion , even while recognizing ( and respecting ) their differences .
Both science and Buddhism , he points out , share a strong empirical basis :
Buddhism must accept the facts — whether found by science or found by contemplative insights .
If , when we investigate something , we find there is reason and proof for it , we must acknowledge that as reality — even if it is in contradiction with a literal scriptural explanation that has held sway for many centuries or with a deeply held opinion or view .
Instead of filtering scientific findings through the sieve of his religion , the Dalai Lama approaches science with humility and openness .
As my comprehension of science has grown , it has gradually become evident to me that , insofar as understanding the physical world is concerned , there are many areas of traditional Buddhist thought where our explanations and theories are rudimentary when compared with those of modern science .
This book is “ not an attempt to unite science and spirituality , ” he explains , “ but an effort to explore two important human disciplines for the purpose of developing a more holistic and integrated way of understanding the world . ”
He begins his exploration by equating science with the worldview of “ scientific materialism , ” which “ seems to be a common unexamined presupposition ” that includes “ a belief in an objective world , independent of the contingency of its observers .
It assumes that the data being analyzed within an experiment are independent of the preconceptions , perceptions , and experience of the scientist analyzing them . ”
Well , not quite .
Most working scientists do make this assumption when conducting their experiments , but they are well aware that their preconceptions can color their analysis and interpretation .
Reality exists , we can agree .
Getting an accurate reading on reality is another matter entirely .
The Dalai Lama ’s other bugbear is scientific reductionism , and here I feel he has set up something of a straw man .
The view that all aspects of reality can be reduced to matter and its various particles is , to my mind , as much a metaphysical position as the view that an organizing intelligence created and controls reality .
This view , he fears , leads to nihilism , and with it the loss of subjective purpose and meaning .
The danger then is that human beings may be reduced to nothing more than biological machines , the products of pure chance in the random combination of genes , with no purpose other than the biological imperative of reproduction .
I do not fault the Dalai Lama for challenging this view of science , which does make it difficult to explain such phenomena as the origins of the universe , life , sentience , and consciousness ( each of which receive individual chapter treatments in his book ) , and is held by a great many people , both within and outside of the scientific community .
Yet the solution to these and other problems , in my opinion , is through the new sciences of complexity , emergence , and self - organization .
The Dalai Lama does not go this route , instead turning to certain Buddhist principles , such as karma .
Karma , he explains , is easily misunderstood by Westerners .
It has to do with causal action , but “ it is erroneous to think of karma as some transcendental unitary entity that acts like a god in a theistic system or a determinist law by which a person ’s life is fated . ”
In fact , from a scientific perspective , karma is just a metaphysical assumption , but “ no more so than the assumption that all of life is material and originated out of pure chance . ”
Although he admits that the Darwinian theory of evolution “ gives us a fairly coherent account of the evolution of human life on earth , ” the Dalai Lama also believes “ that karma can have a central role in understanding the origination of what Buddhism calls ‘ sentience , ’ through the media of energy and consciousness . ”
How ?
In Buddhism , the most fundamental unit of matter is prana , a vital energy indistinguishable from consciousness .
So matter , energy , and consciousness are the same .
Since not only sentience , but the origins of life , consciousness , and morality are inadequately explained by science , it is useful to employ the notion of karma .
Here I am afraid the Dalai Lama proffers the same empty explanations as the creationists and Intelligent Design theorists in what we call the “ God of the Gaps . ”
Wherever there is a gap in scientific explanation — the origins of life , sentience , consciousness , morality — this is where God , or karma , intervened .
But what happens to God / karma when science fills in the gap ?
Are you going to abandon God / karma from your worldview ?
In my opinion , God / karma does not explain anything ; it is just a linguistic place - filler until science can discover the actual cause .
By analogy , cosmologists proffer something called “ dark energy ” and “ dark matter ” to account for certain anomalies in their data .
But cosmologists do not stop there .
They admit that “ dark matter ” is just a convenient label for something they have yet to discover .
When creationists or Buddhists speak of God or karma , they mean it as the actual cause and end of their searching .
Although I applaud the Dalai Lama for his liberal open - mindedness to science , he still has some things to learn about science .
Just because a current theory or philosophy of science fails to account for a phenomenon does not mean that science itself should be abandoned .
And any attempt to blend religion with science , no matter how thoughtful and respectful of both traditions , can only lead to the reduction of the deity to the laws and forces of nature .
A scientist will inevitably search for how , and by what forces and mechanisms , God or karma operated in the world .
I would caution both Christians and Buddhists alike :
Be careful what you wish for in this endeavor to unify science and religion — you may not like what you find .
Sean Carroll , who many of you know from Cosmic Variance , asked the following question in response to my last entry :
I ’m happy to admit that I do n’t know anything about “ one - way functions and interactive proofs . ”
So , in what sense has theoretical computer science contributed more in the last 30 years to our basic understanding of the universe than particle physics or cosmology ?
( Despite the fact that I ’m a cosmologist , I do n’t doubt your statement — I ’d just like to be able to explain it in public . )
I posted my response as a comment , but it ’s probably better to make it an entry of its own .
So :
Hi Sean ,
Thanks for your question !
Of course I was joking when I mentioned “ objective standards ” for ranking scientific fields .
Depending on which questions keep you up at night , different parts of “ humankind ’s basic picture of the universe ” will seem larger or smaller .
( To say that , of course , is not to suggest any relativism about the picture itself . )
What I can do , though , is to tell you why — by my own subjective standards — the contributions of theoretical computer science over the last 30 years rival those of theoretical physics or any other field I know about .
Of course , people will say I only think that because I ’m a theoretical computer scientist , but that gets the causal arrow wrong : I became a theoretical computer scientist because , as a teenager , I thought it !
It ’s probably best to start with some examples .
We now know that , if an alien with enormous computational powers came to Earth , it could prove to us whether White or Black has the winning strategy in chess .
To be convinced of the proof , we would not have to trust the alien or its exotic technology , and we would not have to spend billions of years analyzing one move sequence after another .
We ’d simply have to engage in a short conversation with the alien about the sums of certain polynomials over finite fields .
There ’s a finite ( and not unimaginably - large ) set of boxes , such that if we knew how to pack those boxes into the trunk of your car , then we ’d also know a proof of the Riemann Hypothesis .
Indeed , every formal proof of the Riemann Hypothesis with at most ( say ) a million symbols corresponds to some way of packing the boxes into your trunk , and vice versa .
Furthermore , a list of the boxes and their dimensions can be feasibly written down .
Supposing you do prove the Riemann Hypothesis , it ’s possible to convince someone of that fact , without revealing anything other than the fact that you proved it .
It ’s also possible to write the proof down in such a way that someone else could verify it , with very high confidence , having only seen 10 or 20 bits of the proof .
If every second or so your computer ’s memory were wiped completely clean , except for the input data ; the clock ; a static , unchanging program ; and a counter that could only be set to 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , or 5 , it would still be possible ( given enough time ) to carry out an arbitrarily long computation — just as if the memory were n’t being wiped clean each second .
This is almost certainly not true if the counter could only be set to 1 , 2 , 3 , or 4 .
The reason 5 is special here is pretty much the same reason it ’s special in Galois ’ proof of the unsolvability of the quintic equation .
It would be great to prove that RSA is unbreakable by classical computers .
But every known technique for proving that would , if it worked , simultaneously give an algorithm for breaking RSA !
For example , if you proved that RSA with an n-bit key took n5 steps to break , you would ’ve discovered an algorithm for breaking it in 2n ^ 1 / 5 steps .
If you proved that RSA took 2n ^ 1 / 3 steps to break , you would ’ve discovered an algorithm for breaking it in n( log n ) ^2 steps .
As you show the problem to be harder , you simultaneously show it to be easier .
Alright , let me stop before I get carried away .
The examples I ’ve listed ( and hundreds more like them ) are not exactly discoveries about physics , but they do n’t have the flavor of pure math either .
And even if they have some practical implications for computing ( which they do ) , they certainly do n’t have the flavor of nitty - gritty software engineering .
So what are they then ?
Maybe it ’s helpful to think of them as “ quantitative epistemology ” : discoveries about the capacities of finite beings like ourselves to learn mathematical truths .
On this view , the theoretical computer scientist is basically a mathematical logician on a safari to the physical world : someone who tries to understand the universe by asking what sorts of mathematical questions can and ca n’t be answered within it .
Not whether the universe is a computer , but what kind of computer it is !
Naturally , this approach to understanding the world tends to appeal most to people for whom math ( and especially discrete math ) is reasonably clear , whereas physics is extremely mysterious .
In my opinion , one of the biggest challenges for our time is to integrate the enormous body of knowledge in theoretical computer science ( or quantitative epistemology , or whatever you want to call it ) with the rest of what we know about the universe .
In the past , the logical safari mostly stayed comfortably within 19th - century physics ; now it ’s time to venture out into the early 20th century .
Indeed , that ’s exactly why I chose to work on quantum computing : not because I want to build quantum computers ( though I would n’t mind that ) , but because I want to know what a universe that allows quantum computers is like .
Incidentally , it ’s also why I try hard to keep up with your field .
If I ’m not mistaken , less than a decade ago cosmologists made an enormous discovery about the capacity of finite beings to learn mathematical truths : namely , that no computation carried out in the physical world can ever involve more than 1/ Λ ~ 10122 bits .

Interactive Web pages , long dreamed of by designers , are finally here — Web interfaces that respond instantly to user commands , with minimal page redraw .
All this and more is possible via Ajax ( Asynchronous JavaScript and XML ) , which recently has come into vogue with the Web illuminati .
In JavaScript , and programming in general , the best code is code you do n't have to write .
For serious projects , this often means using a framework — a collection of useful and reusable code that is tested , optimized and ( ideally ) peer - reviewed .
The better frameworks have automated unit tests to make certain they keep working .
Having a good , high - level JavaScript framework , for example , means more time to push the boundaries and less time writing boring building - block code ( and then reworking it when the inevitable cross - browser incompatibilities poke their heads up ) .
MochiKit ( www.mochikit.com) is a JavaScript framework that provides tools for dealing with asynchronous requests ( Ajax ) , DOM ( Document Object Model ) functionality , functional programming tools , dates and times , string formatting , colors , visual effects , events , drag - and - drop ability , sorting and many other features .
MochiKit 1.3 is targeted to work on Safari 2.0.2 , Firefox ( 1.0.7 , 1.5 and 2.0 ) , Opera 8.5 and Internet Explorer ( 6 and 7 ) .
This article provides a quick introduction to MochiKit , explains how to get started with MochiKit ( with interesting stops along the way ) and describes three walk - through examples of varying complexity that also are generic enough to use in your Web applications right now .

What 's in MochiKit ?
Included in MochiKit are algorithms for data structures ( including serialization ) , functional programming , iteration , DOM and CSS manipulation , asynchronous server communication , a signal / slot mechanism for JavaScript events and logging tools .
At this point , MochiKit sounds like the C++ STL of JavaScript .
Above and beyond what the STL provides C++ , MochiKit also provides event handling , drag and drop , colors and visual effects .
On the topic of data structure algorithms , MochiKit provides the powerful iteration tools of filter ( ) , which returns only list elements that match a criteria ; find ( ) ; map ( ) , which returns the result of list elements run through an operation ; and more .
MochiKit also provides tools to translate to and from JSON ( JavaScript Object Notation ) syntax : serializeJSON ( ) and evalJSON ( ) .
Above all , MochiKit gives you the power to hook your own objects into MochiKit 's magic .
MochiKit 's tools for functional programming allow functions to be created dynamically , or they may simply provide more extensive ( or less broken ) behaviors for functionality provided already in JavaScript .
MochiKit 's partial ( ) and bind ( ) functions create a version of a function that requires less parameters or rebind JavaScript 's this parameter , respectively .
In a nutshell , these tools let you create functions dynamically .
These two different functions are n't obviously useful right now , but they are powerful when combined with MochiKit 's iteration tools .
In addition to these data structure tools , MochiKit allows you to create DOM elements dynamically , convert DOM objects to strings , retrieve elements matching class or type attributes , and swap DOM objects for other DOM objects .
Getting Started with MochiKit Want to see some MochiKit magic ?
The Demos page on mochikit.com has several interesting samples .
One of MochiKit 's examples is an interactive JavaScript Interpreter , executing whatever JavaScript code you enter .
In addition , this interpreter provides documentation for MochiKit functions — via help ( ) — returning a clickable link to the passed function .
MochiKit 's documentation page also uses some ( MochiKit - enabled ) JavaScript to display a list of the sub- namespaces of MochiKit .
When the main page loads , it dynamically creates a list of sub- namespaces ( MochiKit .
Async , MochiKit .
Base , MochiKit.DOM and so on ) .
Clicking any item in the list expands or collapses the documentation for the namespace .
No actual list of functions exists — it 's all computed dynamically by ( asynchronously ) requesting each documentation page from the server , then parsing the DOM of each one .
It is worth noting that the documentation on - line corresponds with the release of MochiKit currently in development and not the current “ stable ” version ; each function also lists the version of MochiKit in which it appeared .
Good frameworks have tests to validate their functionality , and MochiKit is no different .
The MochiKit test page ( see Resources ) has almost 800 tests validating MochiKit .
This automated framework allows MochiKit to be validated easily on all the supported browsers .
Example 1 : MochiKit in a Simple Page The MochiKit package is easy to install .
If you downloaded the zip version , move the Mochikit folder in the lib folder to your Web space .
To use the Subversion version , copy the Mochikit folder from your checkout .
Create the following HTML page : <! DOCTYPE html PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN " " http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/xhtml1-strict.dtd " >
< html xmlns= " http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml " xml:lang= " en " lang= " en " > < head > < meta http-equiv= " Content - Type " content = " text / html ; charset=utf - 8 " /> < title > MochiKit Example #1</title > < script type =" text / javascript " charset= " utf - 8 " src= " Mochikit/MochiKit.js " /> < script type =" text / javascript " charset = " utf - 8 " src=" example1.js " /> </ head > < body > < p style= " background : red ; padding - top : 1em ; " >
Hello world this is Mochikit !</ p> </ body > </html >
Notice the following line in your < head > section , which loads MochiKit : < script type = " text / javascript " charset= " utf - 8 " src= " Mochikit/MochiKit.js " />
Also notice that in the body is a paragraph with a red background .
This box is plain - looking .
Would n't it be great if it had rounded corners ?
MochiKit makes it easy .
First , we want to execute a JavaScript function when we load the page .
The MochiKit function for that is MochiKit. DOM.addLoadEvent ( ) .
In JavaScript , the namespace specifiers are optional , but for clarity , we include them here .
We create a separate file for our JavaScript ( a separate file is best ) .
In the file , we have one function and a call to addLoadEvent ( ) : function myLoadFunction ( ) { MochiKit.Visual.roundClass ('p ' , null ) ; } ; MochiKit.DOM.addLoadEvent( myLoadFunction ) ; MochiKit 's roundClass allows you to specify an entire class type , and it rounds all of the elements of that class .
You also can round elements selectively with MochiKit.Visual.roundElement ( ) , which accepts either a string specifying the id or an element object .
Example 2 : Turning Clicked Links into SPANs Our second example uses MochiKit.Base.map( ) , MochiKit.Base.partial( ) , MochiKit .
Signal and MochiKit.DOM to create a link that can be clicked only once and then goes away : function myLoadFunction( eventObj ) { /*
Find all A elements whose class is " onepush " and make them all to call handleJSHREFClick ( ) in response to click */ elementsToApplyOn = MochiKit.DOM.getElementsByTagAndClassName( " a " , " onepush " ) ; /* now that we have all of the elements that match our transformation query run our function that connects everything , calling it once for every item .*/ MochiKit.Base.map ( connectOneClickOnly , elementsToApplyOn ) ; } MochiKit.Signal.connect ( window , " onload " , myLoadFunction ) ; //end main and load MochiKit 's Signal module allows us to have functions called when events happen ( it 's based off Qt's signal / slot mechanism ) .
In the case of the last line of code here , we are having the window object 's onload event call our load function .
Careful readers will remember MochiKit.DOM.addLoadEvent ( ) used in the first example , and yes , we are using similar functionality with MochiKit .
Signal .
Be aware that once you choose one method of handling the load event , you cannot , in the same script , use the other method — they are incompatible in that way .
When the document loads in the browser , myLoadFunction ( ) is called .
This function gathers all the A elements whose class is oneclick and passes them , one by one , to the connectOneClickOnly function .
The MochiKit . Base.map function could be seen as a convenience in writing the following pattern : for ( i = 0 ; i < elementsToApplyOn.length ; i++) connectOneClickOnly(elementsToApplyOn[i ] ) ; Next , we examine the real sweet spot for partial ( ) and bind ( ) — providing parameters to callback functions : function connectOneClickOnly( linkElement ) { /*
This function gets called for each A of type " oneclick " we have .
Hook it up so that our handleJSHREFClick gets called ( properly ) when a user clicks the linkElement object */ /* Each of our calls to handleJSHREFClick , in addition to getting the event object passed to it via MochiKit .
Signal , also gets called with the object to call to create our replacement .
*/ newH = partial ( handleJSHREFClick , makeNewObj ) ; MochiKit.Signal.connect ( linkElement , ' onclick ' , newH ) ; } //end connectOneClickOnly Remember , MochiKit.Base.partial ( ) and MochiKit.Base.bind ( ) allow for runtime creation of functions that are based on other functions .
These wrapper functions can provide parameters or even remap the JavaScript for this variable to the functions they are wrapping .
In this case , we use MochiKit.Base.partial( ) , because there is no way to provide arbitrary arguments to functions called via MochiKit .
Signal ( or any other MochiKit methods that call back to user functions ) .
Using MochiKit.Base.partial( ) , we can pass as many parameters as we want , and MochiKit is none the wiser .
In this case , we supply a function , which creates the replacement SPAN element , to our event handler callback .
We have MochiKit .
Signal call our function when the user clicks on our element : function makeNewObj( target ) { /*
Create a new item to replace our target with .
Return the created element */ makeNew = SPAN ( {} ) ; inHTMLStr = " One Click Only ! " ; makeNew.innerHTML
= inHTMLStr ; return makeNew ; } function handleJSHREFClick ( makeNewF , eventObj ) { /*
When one of our " oneclick " elements have been clicked , this function runs . */ ourTarget = eventObj.target ( ) ; /* stop the event right here ( do n't let it go to the href listed in the A )
Here also so the event is stopped if we have errors further on */ eventObj.stop ( ) ; // call our function that creates new elements makeNew = makeNewF ( ourTarget ) ; swapDOM ( ourTarget , makeNew ) ; } //end click functionality code The handleJSHREFClick ( ) function is called , as previously mentioned , when a user clicks on our oneClick A elements .
Normally , this function would accept only one parameter : the eventObj parameter passed by MochiKit .
Signal .
Because we used MochiKit.Base.partial ( ) , the function is passed another parameter ( in this case , the function to call to create our replacement object ) .
MochiKit .
Signal takes care of the hard work of handling events .
No matter what browser the user is using ( or what event modal that browser uses ) , the JavaScript code does n't have to change — the custom event object from MochiKit .
Signal takes care of all that for you .
Through the passed event object , you can get the key state , the mouse state , the object that triggered the event , the object connect ( ) ed to the event , what type of event happened , and even stop the event from propagating further by preventing the default action of the DOM object .
handleJSHREFClick ( ) swaps the item the user clicked on with the element we created .
First it stops the event , because ( in this instance ) we do n't want to go any further ( that would follow the HREF element of the A , something we do n't want to happen in this particular example ) .
The code that creates our replacement span is in the obvious place : makeNew = SPAN ( {} ) , yet this monster requires some explanation .
DOM elements are created through MochiKit via functions in MochiKit .
DOM .
Like other MochiKit modules , there 's a lot here .
Functions to create , functions to query , swap and even convert DOM elements can be found in this module — getElement ( ) , getElementsByTagAndClassName( ) , currentDocument ( ) , currentWindow ( ) and createDOM ( ) to list a few .
MochiKit.DOM.createDOM ( ) is what is ( indirectly ) used here .
MochiKit.DOM includes shortcuts to create common DOM elements ( A , BUTTON , BR , CANVAS , DIV , FIELDSET , FORM , H1 , H2 , H3 , HR , IMG , INPUT , LABEL , LEGEND , LI , OL , OPTGROUP , OPTION , P , PRE , SELECT , SPAN , STRONG , TABLE , TBODY , TD , TEXTAREA , TFOOT , TH , THEAD , TR , TT and UL , at the time of this writing ) .
These are called with the attributes specified in the associative array parameter .
In the passed array , each key corresponds to an attribute of the HTML element .
For example , to create a link to example.com , the code would be : makeNew = A ( { 'href ' : ' http://www.example.com'});
This example covered a lot of ground — MochiKit.Signal.connect ( ) , MochiKit.Base.partial ( ) and MochiKit.DOM.createElement ( ) .
However , we 've scratched only the surface of these , and there 's a whole lot more of MochiKit to cover .
The next example takes the normal login box found all over the Web and “ Web 2.0 's ” it up .
Example 3 : Simple User Name / Password UI with Ajax Our final example creates a dynamic login screen .
The idea is to provide feedback for an incorrect password without refreshing the entire Web page .
On success , the main menu screen loads without requiring a full page reload .
MochiKit 's logging functionality is n't only for debugging .
Instead , it can be co-opted to be an easy error - reporting mechanism .
We use this mechanism to report both incorrect user name / password errors and errors with the login script on the server ( server down and so on ) : function fatalLog( sendLogTo , logInst ) /* handles our logError calls , displays in element param # 1 , displaying the error in yellow then fading it out after 5 seconds */ { var errStr = logInst.info.join ( " " ) ; if ( errStr.length == 0 ) errStr = " Unknown error " ; sendLogTo.innerHTML
= " < pre >
We 're sorry an error occurred : " + errStr + " .
Please try again . </ pre > " ; Highlight ( sendLogTo , {delay : 1 , duration : 5} ) ; //Yellow Fade Technique //see Visual .
DefaultOptions documentation for // associative array options that affect // MochiKit .
Visual } //end fatalLog Co-opting MochiKit 's log functionality means that all errors can be reported using MochiKit .
Logging calls .
During debugging of this site , something else could be set up to handle the errors — perhaps logging more information or breaking into a source - level debugger .
We have an issue here : when parts of the page redraw , it 's sometimes not obvious that part of the page contains new information .
The user could be waiting for something to happen when , in fact , it already has .
The Ajax community has solved this by highlighting changed elements in yellow ( traditionally ) and fading back to the normal background after an amount of time .
This technique ( the yellow fade technique ) is used , in particular , by 37 Signals ( the minds behind Ruby on Rails ) .
The technique is used here to prompt users to react to the error ( for example , try the password again ) .
MochiKit makes this technique very easy with MochiKit. Visual .
Highlight ( ) .
We can specify how long to delay before starting the effect , how long it should last and other options , all specified via an associative array ( see the keys outlined in MochiKit. Visuals .
DefaultOptions ) .
Many of MochiKit 's visual effects were ported from Scriptaculous for MochiKit 1.4 .
As shown in the next code sample , our load function plugs our fatalLog function into the MochiKit .
Logging framework , then sets up the environment to call our subClicked handler when the submit button is pressed : function subClicked ( eventObj ) /* checks the username / pw*/ { d = MochiKit.Async.doSimpleXMLHttpRequest( cgiLoginLocation , { ' username ' : getElement ( ' uname ') .value , ' passw ' : getElement ( ' pword ').value } ) ; d.addCallback(handleServerResult_Login ) ; d.addErrback(handleServerError ) ; getElement ( ' waitMsg').innerHTML
= " Please wait ... " ; clearError ( ) ; // clear the old error message , it does n't apply } // end subClicked function myLoadFunction ( ) { /* first create our Logging listener , and direct our generic function the errMsg span we have */ fatalLogTo = partial ( fatalLog , MochiKit.DOM.getElement('errorMsg ' ) ) ; MochiKit.Logging.logger.addListener(' ERRORONLY ' , null , fatalLogTo ) ; MochiKit.Signal.connect ( ' submit ' , ' onclick ' , subClicked ) ; // now hide the place where our main menu will be MochiKit. Style.hideElement ( " Result " ) ; } /*connect our event handlers right off*/ MochiKit.Signal.connect ( window , " onload " , myLoadFunction ) ; //end script MochiKit.Async.doSimpleXMLHttpRequest is the simplest way in MochiKit to do an Ajax request .
It accepts the URI to which to send the request , the GET parameters for that URI , and it returns a MochiKit .
Async .
Deferred object .
For advanced requirements , MochiKit .
Async also provides functionality for sending POSTs instead of GETs , obtaining JSON documents and more .
All MochiKit .
Async
Ajax functions return a Deferred object , so ( beyond the construction ) these functions behave exactly as in our example doSimpleXMLHttpRequest ( ) .
By the time we have our Deferred object , the Ajax event already is sent off .
Because the call is asynchronous , it may be several seconds until an answer is received — plenty of time to set up functions ( callbacks ) that will handle error or success .
The MochiKit . Async .
Deferred object is merely a guarantee that something will happen — what happens is up to us .
When a Deferred object comes back from a MochiKit Ajax request , execution of the script continues while we wait .
This allows us to set up our callbacks and do whatever other housekeeping is required .
When a response comes back from the server , good or bad , the appropriate callback set up in the Deferred object is called .
The success and failure callback functions get one status parameter from MochiKit .
Async .
Additional parameters can be sent to the callback functions by passing them to MochiKit.
Async.addCallback()/MochiKit.Async.addErrback ( ) .
The status parameter always is the last parameter provided to the callback function .
Success functions are called if the HTTP status code from the XMLHttpRequest is 200 , 201 , 204 or 304 .
The error function is called if the status is any other number .
Success functions get a standard XMLHttpRequest object as the status object .
If you 've never seen one of these , the important items are responseText and status .
Failure functions get an XMLHttpRequestError parameter .
The important items of this object are message and number .
With all this background , we can handle our XMLHttpRequest .
Remember , the idea behind this example is to do all the work required in a login screen without refreshing the page .
To accomplish this , first we send an XMLHttpRequest to check the user name and password and return a session ID .
In our case , the responseText from the CGI is a string whose contents are formatted as a JavaScript array .
With this formatting , we could run JavaScript 's eval ( ) to get the result as a JavaScript array object , or we could simply call MochiKit. Async.evalJSONRequest( ) to do the same thing .
In our case , the array contains ( in order ) : a success boolean , a failure message ( or an empty string , if the call succeeded ) and a session ID ( or 0 , in the case of failure ) .
The success callback handleServerResult_Login ( ) should check the success passed back from the CGI .
If we have a success , it sends a second Ajax request to load the main menu .
During this second request , the server checks the session ID , making sure it is valid , then returns HTML code for the main menu ( or an error message ) .
When this ( second ) request succeeds , the handleServerResult_Manage ( ) clears the login controls away ( which we do with a cool transition effect , courtesy of MochiKit.
Visual ) and inserts the main menu code .
On success , cookies can be set to save the session ID ( see www.quirksmode.org/js/cookies.html for cookie manipulation functions ; future versions of MochiKit may include cookie manipulation functions ) : function handleServerError( err ) { getElement ( " waitMsg " ).innerHTML = " " ; logError ( err.message + " ( error # " + err.number + " ) " ) ; //err.message will be like " Request Failed " } //end handleServerError function handleServerResult_Manage( sessionID , res ) { // get rid of our login controls - we 're very // much validated by this point slideUp ( getElement ( ' loginDlg ' ) ) ; // our responseText will be the HTML for the / /" main menu " where To = getElement ( " Result " ) ; whereTo.innerHTML = res.responseText ; MochiKit.Visual.appear ( whereTo , {delay : 1} ) ; createCookie ( " sessionID " , sessionID , 1 ) ; getElement ( " waitMsg " ) .innerHTML
= " Cookie value = " + readCookie(' sessionID ' ) ; } //end handleServerResult_Manage function handleServerResult_Login ( res ) { getElement ( " waitMsg " ).innerHTML = " " ; // no more waiting required !
//res.responseText contains our result .
Our CGI // returns it as a JS array inside a string // but just let MochiKit handle it for us resList = MochiKit.Async.evalJSONRequest( res ) ; success = resList [ 0 ] ; failMsg = resList [ 1 ] ; sessionID = resList [ 2 ] ; if ( success ) { // send off _another_ AJAX request //( passing session id ) , this time to get // the main menu screen d2 = MochiKit.Async.doSimpleXMLHttpRequest( cgiMainMenuLocation , {'sessionID ' : sessionID } ) ; d2.addCallback ( handleServerResult_Manage , sessionID ) ; d2.addErrback(handleServerError ) ; } else { logError ( failMsg ) ; } } //end handleServerResult_Login
Conclusion MochiKit is a powerful toolkit , making advanced features easy in JavaScript .
From visual effects , event handling and functional tools to Ajax functionality , MochiKit puts amazing features at your fingertips .
Valentine ’s
Day is nearly upon us , that sweet Hallmark holiday when you can have anything your heart desires , so long as it ’s red .
Red roses , red nighties , red shoes and red socks .
Red Oreo filling , red bagels , red lox .
As it happens , red is an exquisite ambassador for love , and in more ways than people may realize .
Not only is red the color of the blood that flushes the face and swells the pelvis and that one swears one would spill to save the beloved ’s prized hide .
It is also a fine metaphoric mate for the complexity and contrariness of love .
In red we see shades of life , death , fury , shame , courage , anguish , pride and the occasional overuse of exfoliants designed to combat signs of aging .
Red is bright and bold and has a big lipsticked mouth , through which it happily speaks out of all sides at once .
Yoo - hoo !
yodels red , come close , have a look .
Stop right there , red amends , one false move and you ’re dead .
Such visual semiotics are not limited to the human race .
Red is the premier signaling color in the natural world , variously showcasing a fruitful bounty , warning of a fatal poison or boasting of a sturdy constitution and the genes to match .
Red , in other words , is the poster child for the poster , for colors that have something important to say .
“ Our visual system was shaped by colors already in use among many plants and animals , and red in particular stands out against the green backdrop of nature , ” said Dr. Nicholas Humphrey , a philosopher at the London School of Economics and the author of “ Seeing Red : A Study in Consciousness . ”
“ If you want to make a point , you make it in red . ”
What is it , then , to see red , to see any palette at all ?
Of our famed rods and cones , the two classes of light - sensing cells with which the retina at the back of each eye is supplied , the rods do the basics of vision , of light versus shadow , tracking every passing photon and allowing us to see by even a star ’s feeble flicker , though only in gunmetal shades of black , white and grim .
It is up to our cone cells to capture color , and they do n’t kick in until the dawn ’s earylish light or its Edisonian equivalent , which is why we have almost no color vision at night .
The Unpredictability of Baby Names
Because we had a chapter in our book about the socioeconomic impact of baby names , we ’ve blogged many times about baby names in the past , including just the other day .
One question that rarely arises , however , is this :
How possible is it to predict which names will become more popular in time , and which ones will fall ?
We did make a run at predicting some of the boy and girl names that might become popular in ten years ’ time , based on the observation that the masses tend to choose names that first become popular among high - education , high - income parents .
But trends , including naming trends , tend to march to a drummer that is n’t always audible .
If you had to pick one name in the past of couple years , however , that you were sure would be abandoned , it would probably be wise to pick Katrina .
Who on earth would name their baby after a hurricane that nearly wiped out an entire city ?
And indeed , according to this A.P. report , the name did slump in the 12 months following Hurricane Katrina , with only 850 namings in the U.S. , slipping on the list of popular girl ’s names from No. 247 to No. 382 .
That ’s a pretty big drop , though perhaps not as big as you might think .
Why was n’t the drop even steeper ?
You might think it ’s because parents far from the affected areas were n’t all that tuned in to the hurricane and its destruction .
And if so , you would be wrong .
In the two states most severely affected by Hurricane Katrina , the name actually received more action in the 12 months following the storm than in the 12 months previous .
In Louisiana , the name increased from 8 incidences to 15 , while in Mississippi , it spiked from 7 to 24 .
And I am guessing that the rate of Katrina namings increased even more , since there were lots of displaced people from both states who gave birth to their babies — maybe their Katrinas — elsewhere .
Maybe parents who live in Louisiana named their baby girls Katrina as affirmation that they ’d lived through the storm — a kind of hair - of - the - dog naming treatment .
Maybe they named their girls Katrina to commemorate friends or relatives who lost their homes or even their lives .
But one thing ’s for sure : I do n’t know of anyone who would have predicted that there would be more Katrinas in Louisiana and Mississippi after the hurricane .
Which says at least as much about our incessant desire to predict as it says about the people who had babies last year .
My boss tells me this post , from my other blog , Epidemix ( where I obsess over the margins of public health and medicine ) , might be of interest here .
It 's long , so here 's a chunk :
Wikipedia is , by all measures , one of the great accomplishments of the Internet Age .
I 'm willing to say it stands alongside Google , eBay , GoogleMaps , IMDB and Wired.com as among the greatest resources on the Web ( ok , that last one is self - serving ) .
But boy , does it suck when it comes to science topics .
Curious about just what epigenetics is ?
Figure you really should know what mitochondria do ?
Do n't count on Wikipedia - odds are their analysis is too pedantic for you , as it is for me .
Look at that Epigenetics entry , for instance , which comes up first when you Google the term " epigenetics " .
Here 's the first sentence :
In biology , while the subject of genetics focuses on how organisms can inherit traits by inheriting genes from their parent ( s ) , which encode information for cell function as sequences of DNA , epigenetics is sometimes used to refer to additional methods of biological inheritance that do not directly relate to the inheritance of collections of genes , or soft inheritance .
Huh ?
Now I 'm sure that 's accurate , but it 's way too rich for my blood .
A better primer can be found at the backgrounder from Johns Hopkins that ranks as the number three hit :
There is far more to genetics than the sequence of building blocks in the DNA molecules that make up our genes and chromosomes .
The " more " is known as epigenetics .
What is epigenetics ?
Epigenetics , literally " on " genes , refers to all modifications to genes other than changes in the DNA sequence itself .
Epigenetic modifications include addition of molecules , like methyl groups , to the DNA backbone .
That , I get .
It 's the same on so many other topics .
Now given that there are 1.8 million articles on Wikipedia , there are bound to be dozens - if not thousands - of exceptions .
For instance , on the basic science entries - biology , cancer , volcanology - Wikipedians have created useful , thoughtful , and readable dispatches .
And sometimes there 's been the laudable foresight to add " introduction to " pages , such as those for quantum mechanics and quantum physics .
But increasingly , I find myself skipping over a Wikipedia result on Google not because I 'm worried about the validity of the information there - I do n't share that concern and think it 's way overblown - but rather because I 'm worried it 's just going to be a bunch of formulae I can't parse and jargon I can't unpack .

To figure out what teens are up to when their parents are n’t watching , we gave 53 boys and 47 girls from four Manhattan high schools ( Dalton , La Guardia , Beacon , and MLK ) a “ purity test , ” a series of 37 questions designed to tease out exactly how far they go .
Then we went after 100 parents — not the parents of the kids we polled , but parents with kids in the same teen demographic .
( We would have liked to administer a take - home purity test , but alas . )
We found them — 54 moms and 46 dads — in midtown , and put them to the test , with one difference :
We asked them to guess their own teens ’ answers .
As you ’ll see , the high schoolers and the parents live on fairly different planets .

In light of the recent controversy in which Ron Paul had the gall to suggest that September 11th originated from years of mistrust and animosity towards the Western world and America in particular with regards to involvement in the Middle East , we wanted to provide a succinct list of perceived grievances towards America .
Stated by Radley Balko in Fox News ( of all places ) :
The “ blowback ” theory is n’t some fringe idea common only to crazy Sept. 11 conspiracy theorists .
It does n’t suggest that we “ deserved ” the Sept. 11 attacks , nor does it suggest we should n’t have retaliated against the people who waged them … .
What it does say is that actions have consequences .
When the Arab and Muslim world continually sees U.S. troops marching through Arab and Muslim backyards , U.S. trade sanctions causing Arab and Muslim suffering and U.S. bombs landing on Arab and Muslim homes , it is n’t difficult to see how Arabs could begin to develop a deep contempt for the U.S .
In this post , I ’ll try to provide a concise summary of grievances that resonate with the Middle Eastern public that facilitates a hostility towards America and fuel the extremism that led to 9/11 , the Madrid bombings , and the July 7th attacks in London :
1. Perpetuation of Israeli / Palestinian Conflict
Since the creation of Israel in 1948 , the Palestinian conflict has become a symbol of Western imperialism forced upon Arabs .
Over 89 billion dollars in foreign aid , much in the way of defense grants , has been given to the Israeli’s to create a first world country with the strongest military in the world .
In comparison , the Palestinians have lived under an economically crooked and politically backwards country further stratified and isolated by the Israeli occupation that has existed since 1967 .
The everyday realities of the world ’s longest military occupation combined with Israeli settlements condemned repeatedly by the United Nations yet ignored by the United States solidifies many beliefs that the US , as the primary backer of Israel , is guilty of facilitating their crimes .
In the Baker - Hamilton report , US - led peace efforts in Palestine - Israel was listed as the crucible of restoring the American image in the Middle East .
2. The Support of Undemocratic / Illegitimate Governments
While the Bush administration has superficially promoted democracy as a panacea to the Middle East , America has continued to strengthen ties with the regions most undemocratic countries .
The most notorious and despised of these may be the Egyptian government headed by Hosni Mubarak — an autocratic system that relies on an intelligence agency known for medieval torturing of government opposition .
Since 1979 , over $ 50 billion has been given to Egypt , including an average of over 1 billion dollars a year in military aid .
The US ’ involvement in the overthrow of the Prime Minister of Iran in the 1950s is also a key event in understanding Middle Eastern resentment of America .
America ’s support of Saudi Arabia , Bin Laden ’s home country , has led him to state “ our country has become an American colony . ”
In this context , he likens himself to the French resistance fighting against the Germans .
It ’s strange to think that when he was fighting Soviet colonization of Afghanistan , America saw it that way too .
3. 1990 -2003 Sanctions Against Iraq
United Nations sanctions against Iraq were imposed by the United Nations in 1990 following Iraq ’s invasion of Kuwait in 1990 , and continued until the US - led invasion of Iraq in 2003 .
They were perhaps the toughest , most comprehensive sanctions in history , and have caused much controversy over the humanitarian impact , culminating with two senior UN representatives in Iraq resigning in protest of the sanctions .
In as much as the economic sanctions were designed to topple Saddam they were a failure , however the sanctions caused the death of between 400,000 and 800,000 Iraqi children .
The reasons include lack of medical supplies , malnutrition , and especially disease owing to lack of clean water .
Among other things , chlorine , needed for disinfecting water supplies , was banned as having a “ dual use ” in potential weapons manufacture .
On May 10 , 1996 , appearing on 60 Minutes , Madeleine Albright , then U.S. Ambassador to the United Nations , was presented with a figure of half a million children under five having died from the sanctions .
Not challenging this figure , she infamously replied “ we think the price is worth it ” .
The sanctions regime was finally ended on May 22 , 2003 ( with certain arms - related exceptions ) by paragraph 10 of UNSC , after approximately 1.5 million people had died .
Osama bin Laden stated that one of the three reasons the World Trade Center was attacked was the U.S. sanctions against Iraq .
4. Presence of American Troops in the Middle East
United States troops have been stationed in Saudi Arabia since the First Gulf War and have become a potent symbol of Washington ’s role in the region , and many Saudis see them as proof of the country ’s subservience to America .
Saudi Arabia is home to some of Islam ’s holiest sites and the deployment of US forces there was seen as a historic betrayal by many Islamists , notably Osama Bin Laden .
It is one of the main reasons given by the Saudi - born dissident to justify violence against the United States and its allies .
5. Diplomacy of Convenience
The Cold War created an atmosphere of a zero-sum diplomatic game in the world and the Middle East provided for a fertile battleground for this extensively intrusive style of diplomacy .
In the 1980 ’s , America provided arms and financial assistance to the Mujahdeen ’s ( including Osama Bin Laden and future founders of the Taliban ) to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan .
With the Iraqi - Iranian war raging , America provided Saddam Hussein with conventional and chemical weapons , while at the same time supplying Iran in the Iran - Contra Affair .
The chemical weapons would eventually be used by Saddam on the Iranians and on his own population during civil unrest from the Kurds .
The painfully accurate quip during apprehensions to the 2003 invasion of Iraq was “ We know Iraq has weapons of mass destruction ; we still have the receipt ” .

SAN FRANCISCO -- Stefan
Heller 's dream is to someday find a cure for deafness .
As a leader in stem cell - based research on the inner ear at the Stanford University School of Medicine , he 's got a step - by - step plan for making this dream a reality .
It may take another decade or so , but if anyone can do it , he 's the guy to place your bets on .
" Everyone asks , ' How long before we do this ? ' " said Heller , PhD , associate professor of otolaryngology , whose accent still bears the trace of his native Germany .
" I tell them the devil is in the details . "
But even at the national level , those in the research community remain hopeful that Heller 's work will reap successes sooner rather than later .
Heller will discuss his stem cell research during a panel discussion Feb. 17 in San Francisco at the annual meeting of the American Association for the Advancement of Science .
The session is titled " Hearing health :
The looming crisis and what can be done about it . "
James Battey , MD , director of the National Institute on Deafness and Other Communication Disorders , lauded Heller as " one of the leading auditory neuroscientists " and points to his stem cell regeneration research as a high priority for the institute .
Heller 's vision is to develop a variety of possible cures for deafness .
For the past year and a half , since coming to Stanford from Harvard , he 's been focused on two paths : drug therapy - which could be as simple as an application of ear drops - and stem cell transplantation into the inner ear to remedy hearing loss .
Currently he 's working on perfecting the steps toward eventual stem cell transplantation into humans , with the goal of first curing deafness in mice within the next five years .
His lab is also busy studying the ability of birds to regenerate the tiny hair cells in the cochlea .
It 's these cells that convert the mechanical energy of sound into electrical impulses that are sent to the brain so that a chicken , a mouse or a human can hear .
Chickens , like all birds , have the ability to spontaneously regenerate these hair cells , which explains why there are no deaf birds .
" This is promising because it means the genetic program for regeneration exists somewhere in the vertebrate family , " Heller said .
" We know there is an unknown signal to regenerate that we could use , but we first have to find it . "
The idea of using drug therapy to cure deafness has been at the back of Heller 's mind since he began researching the inner ear 12 years ago , and it has become more plausible as a result of his lab 's successes in the field of stem cell research during the past seven years .
Heller gained international attention in 2003 for identifying stem cells that reside within the inner ear .
Since then , his research has focused on using these stem cells to regenerate the critically needed hair cells in the inner ear .
Later in 2003 , his group reached another significant milestone : the team demonstrated that it is possible to coax embryonic stem cells in a test tube to differentiate into hair cells - and then also to have the stem cells differentiate after transplantation in the ears of chicken embryos .
The two different approaches - new drugs and stem cell transplants - are important because drug treatments are unlikely to help everyone .
For some people with genetically caused hearing disorders , he explained , no drug is likely to help .
" For them , stem cell transplantation may be the answer , " he said
But for the majority of those with hearing loss , particularly in the aging population , drug therapy could be the solution .
As the population has aged and noise pollution has grown more severe , health experts now estimate that one in three adults over the age of 65 has developed a handicapping hearing loss .
Coming up with the answers is a slow process , Heller said .
" This research takes time and money , but we remain hopeful we 'll have some principle answers soon . "
###
EMBARGOED FOR RELEASE UNTIL : Saturday , Feb. 17 , 2007 , at 9:45 a.m. Pacific time to coincide with a presentation at the American Association for the Advancement of Science 's annual meeting .
Heller will also speak at a press briefing later that day at 1 p.m. MEDIA CONTACT : Tracie White at ( 650 ) 723-7628 ( traciew@stanford.edu )
Four out of five Zimbabweans live below the bread line , analysts claim
April 's inflation rate jumped up from the 2,200 % recorded last month , the Central Statistical Office ( CSO ) said .
The announcement came after Zimbabwe 's government created a commission charged with finding a way to curb the country 's spiralling cost of living .
There is high unemployment , and fuel and food shortages across the nation .
Price increases to ' worsen '
The surging cost of domestic electricity , food , fuel and commuter transport fares were at the heart of last month 's price surges , the CSO said .
Economists believe that these price increases will continue because Zimbabwe will be forced to import maize , a basic food staple , to make up for a lack of home - grown produce .
The government has also recently warned of shortages of bread and flour , which may cause even more hardship .
The BBC's Peter Biles said that only 10 % of the country 's winter wheat crop had been planted due to shortages of fuel and fertilizer .
Last week , households in Zimbabwe were told they would be limited to four hours electricity supply a day in a move designed to support the country 's wheat farmers , who need power to irrigate their crops .
Economic crisis
Rampant inflation is a clear sign of a deep economic crisis , analysts said .
Critics have blamed President Robert Mugabe 's policies , particularly the seizure of white - owned farms , for damaging the once self - sufficient country - in the past described as the bread basket of Africa .
President Mugabe , meanwhile , has accused foreign governments of trying to sabotage Zimbabwe 's economy and topple him .
Defiant Hamas leader says attacks on Israel will go on despite heavy human cost in Gaza
Khaled Mashal , the influential political leader of the Palestinian Islamist movement Hamas , insists attacks on Israel will continue despite overwhelming Israeli retaliation that has cost scores of lives in the Gaza Strip in the past two weeks .
Speaking in Damascus yesterday he asserted it was the right of the Palestinians to resist " Zionist aggression " regardless of whether their actions were effective .
The continuing siege of the Palestinians would lead to an explosion that would affect the entire Middle East , he predicted .
" Under occupation people do n't ask whether their means are effective in hurting the enemy , " he told the Guardian in a rare interview at his heavily guarded offices , plastered with images of Jerusalem and " martyrs " killed by the Israelis .
" The occupiers always have the means to hurt the people they control .
The Palestinians have only modest means , so they defend themselves however they can . "
Hamas has been the main force behind more than 250 qassam rockets fired at southern Israel from Gaza in the past two weeks , killing two civilians .
Israeli aircraft have struck dozens of times to curb the attacks , killing some 50 Palestinians .
" The Palestinians are steadfast and there are many ways of resisting according to opportunities and conditions , " Mr Mashal said .
In the past Hamas carried out many suicide bombings inside Israel ; its main weapons now are the primitive but occasionally deadly missiles fired by its military wing , the Qassam Brigades .
The Hamas leader , who helped Saudi Arabia broker February 's Mecca agreement creating a Palestinian unity government , ending clashes with the rival Fatah movement , blamed outsiders for recent renewed fighting between the two sides .
" Palestinians have made some mistakes and wrong bets , " he admitted .
" But negative foreign intervention , especially by the US and Israel , is responsible for these internal conflicts . "
US financial support and training for Fatah is intended to boost its ability to control security and confront Hamas .
Problems have been compounded by the siege imposed on the Palestinian Authority by the US and EU after Hamas won democratic elections in 2005 , Mr Mashal said .
" The siege is collective punishment , and a crime .
And the crime is even worse after the Mecca agreement because Palestinians had expected the siege would be lifted .
" Now the international community is trying to undermine Hamas .
That will lead to an explosion that will be in the face of the Israeli occupation .
The damage will affect the stability of the entire region . "
Mr Mashal rejected demands by the Quartet ( the US , the EU , the UN and Russia ) that Hamas accept three conditions - recognition of Israel , an end to violence and acceptance of previous peace agreements with Israel .
These terms had been accepted by Yasser Arafat and Mahmoud Abbas , the Fatah leader and president of the Palestinian Authority , but that had not forced Israel to withdraw .
It was the Palestinians who needed recognition , not Israel , he said .
It was a " pretext " to demand the amendment of the Hamas Charter , which says : " Israel will ... remain until Islam eliminates it as it had eliminated its predecessors . "
The charter calls the whole of Palestine an Islamic trust which cannot be given away to non-Muslims .
Some recent Hamas statements have implied acceptance of Israel as a " reality " but without saying so explicitly .
" We have agreed to a Palestinian state in the 1967 borders , " Mr Mashal said without elaboration .
" This is our national goal . "
To his own people , Mr Mashal is an admired leader , but the Israelis see him as a dangerous terrorist .
Ten years ago he was the target of an assassination attempt in Jordan by Mossad agents who injected him with poison .
But the operation was exposed and Israel was forced to provide the antidote .
Last week Israel 's public security minister , Avi Dichter , warned that he and other Hamas leaders could be targeted wherever they were .
Machine - gun - toting guards and surveillance cameras outside his offices give a hint of the precautions in place to protect him .
Mr Mashal , described by western sources as the channel for Iranian financial support for Hamas , said the movement 's relationship with the Islamic Republic was natural and being exploited by their common enemies .
The US has pressed Syria to close down the Damascus offices but Syria insists it will not .
Contemplating the forthcoming 40th anniversary of the June 1967 Middle East war , when Israel conquered the West Bank , Gaza Strip , East Jerusalem , the Golan Heights and Sinai desert , he underlined his view that armed resistance will eventually succeed .
" What caused Sharon to leave Gaza , Barak to leave Lebanon in 2000 ?
And look what 's going on in Iraq where the greatest power in the world is facing confusion because of Iraqi resistance .
Time is on the side of the Palestinian people .
We are right , and our cause is just , despite the appeasement of Israel by most powerful members of the international community . "
Kdo ustvarja in kdo uporablja ?
Nihče se recimo ne vpraša , kdo je te vsebine ustvaril .
Slike golih lepotic in lepotcev , fotografije naše najljubše glasbene skupine ali le preprosto ljubka risba ima vedno avtorja , je pa res , da se le - ta v poplavi materiala na spletu preprosto izgubi .
Spletni dnevniki , ki so vedno bolj prisotni na vseh področjih medijskega izražanja , so tukaj najbolj na udaru .
Na njih namreč avtorji objavljajo ogromne količine tekstovnega , slikovnega , avdio in video materiala , ki ga večinoma neznani pisci spletnih dnevnikov objavljajo iz lastnega užitka , ne zavedajo pa se , da medijske hiše to izkoriščajo .
Znan primer iz preteklosti je igralec in medijskih voditelj Jonas Žnidaršič , ki je na svojem spletnem dnevniku objavil recenzijo prireditve Viktorji , tabloid Jana pa je njegove besede dobesedno povzel in jih brez dovoljenja avtorja objavil v eni izmed svojih izdaj .
Novinarji so si najbrž mislili : „ Hej , zadevo je itak objavil na spletu ... torej je javna ! “
Tako razumevanje spleta in vsebin , ki se pojavljajo na spletu , je zelo pogosto .
V večini primerov so spletne strani , s katerih ljudje jemljejo vsebine in jih uporabljajo za lastne namene , daleč stran in je možnost sankcij tako majhna , da se večini ne zdi vredno vprašati avtorja .
Vendar pa ni vedno tako .
Spletni dnevniki so neskončen vir vsebin
Roni je avtor spletnega dnevnika : had : in na njem objavlja svoje fotografije iz različnih prireditev .
Večinoma so to fotografije mičnih deklet in hitrih avtomobilov .
Roni sebe opisuje kot polprofesionalnega fotografa , ki mu fotografija ne pomeni primarni vir zaslužka .
„ S fotografijo se ukvarjam ljubiteljsko , vseeno pa svoje fotografije tudi prodajam ter zato državi plačujem davek .
Zato me moti , ko moje fotografije najdejo mesto v časopisih po nelegalni poti , “ pravi .
Zmotila ga je tudi vest , da je časnik Slovenske novice objavil eno od njegovih fotografij .
„ To se mi je zdelo zanimivo zato , ker se s Slovenskimi novicami nisem nikoli pogovarjal o prodaji fotomateriala , “ zadevo ironično komentira Roni .
„ Poklical sem gospoda Bauerja , in ker je bil odstoten , me je čez nekaj časa poklicala Monica Vitti , se mi predstavila kot urednica Bulvarja in izjavila , da so slike na spletu javna last in da se tukaj z njo nimam kaj pogovarjat . “
So spletne vsebine res javna last ?
Pravnik Jaka Repanšek , direktor svetovalnega podjetja RePublis d.o.o. , pojasnjuje :
„ Žal splošno prepričanje ne drži in je v resnici popolnoma zmotno .
Gledano skozi prizmo Zakona o avtorski in sorodnih pravicah ( ZASP ) varstvo avtorske pravice ( materialnih in moralnih avtorskih upravičenj ) na spletu ni drugačno od varstva avtorske pravice kot v t.i. " klasičnih " medijih , denimo v časopisih in na televiziji .
Za izkoriščanje ( kopiranje , objavljanje , prirejanje ... ) avtorskih del veljajo enaka osnovna pravila : avtorska pravica je " monopol " , s katerim avtor ( in drugi zakoniti imetniki materialnih avtorskih pravic ) odločajo o načinu in obsegu izkoriščanja avtorskih del .
Povedano drugače - če je na spletu objavljena fotografija , to ne pomeni , da je ta fotografija v " public domain " , saj tudi fotografije , objavljene v npr. v reviji za " lepoto in prosti čas " niso last vsakega , ki ima " pet minut časa " za kopiranje , skeniranje in objavo teh fotografij v svojem mediju ( četudi je to žalostna praksa tudi v najbolje pripravljeni novi članici EU ) . “
Kaj pa če se zgodi ravno obratno ?
Če neko spletno vsebino , sliko , besedilo objavi v tiskanemu mediju ?
„ Dobro vprašanje - v praksi se namreč to pogosto dogaja .
Možnosti je več - če je izdajatelj fotografije na spletu ( ali avtor sam ) dovolil uporabo fotografije , je treba paziti le na navajanje naslova spletne strani in seveda spoštovanje avtorjeve moralne avtorske pravice ( priznanje avtorstva - podpis avtorja pod fotografijo , kolikor ta na spletni fotografiji obstaja ) .
Če pa izrecnega dovoljenja za neodplačno uporabo fotografije ni in pri nadaljnji uporabi ne moremo govoriti o prosti uporabi avtorskega dela , seveda pride do kršitve materialnih avtorskih pravic ( zakonitega imetnika ) in pogosto tudi do kršitve moralnih avtorskih pravic avtorja ( nenavajanje avtorjevega imena ) .
Imetnik materialnih avtorskih pravic ( npr. izdajatelj spletnega medija ) ima pravico zahtevati plačilo t.i. civilne kazni ( običajno avtorsko nadomestilo za določeno obliko eksploatacije , povišano za 200 % ) ter tudi druge oblike sodnega varstva .
Ne bo pa mogoče kršitve odpraviti npr . z uničenjem celotne naklade časopisov , ki vsebujejo sporno spletno fotografijo , saj bi bil to nesorazmerno velik poseg v interese časopisnega izdajatelja in njegovih bralcev .
V poštev pride torej poplačilo nadomestila za nedovoljeno uporabo avtorskega dela – v denarju , “ zaključi Repanšek .
40,000 tolarjev za dve fotografiji
Roni se je po dolgem času končno dokopal do odgovornega urednika Slovenskih novic .
Takole na svojem spletnem dnevniku pripoveduje o sestanku .
„ G. Bauer se mi je najprej opravičil za nevšečnosti , potem pa me povprašal o znesku , ki ga želim za objavljeni fotografiji .
Povedal mi je , da so takšne fotografije plačane po približno 2000 sit za komad .
Jaz sem mu povedal , da je na blogu objavljen cenik in da si želim plačila po takšnem znesku .
Ko sem mu povedal številko je ugotovil , da mu je veliko lažje , če prepusti primer pravnikom in se vse skupaj konča na sodišču .
Glede na to , da se zavedam stroškov , ki bi jih imel z odvetnikom in vsega časa , ki bi ga porabil za to , sem ga prosil , naj sam predlaga ceno za eno fotografijo .
Začela sva z 10 k sit , jaz se nisem strinjal s ponujeno številko , ponudil mi je 15 k sit , pa mi tudi ni bilo dovolj .
Ko sem ga pogledal v oči , ko je rekel , da mi da 20 k sit za eno fotografijo , sem vedel , da je to zadnja cena , ki mi jo je pripravljen ponuditi .
In sem jo sprejel .
40 k sit za dve fotografiji , kateri mi nista niti v ponos , je več kot dovolj , “ piše .
Bi bilo Slovenskim novicam tako težko že na začetu prositi za dovoljenje ?
I honestly have no idea how the Bush administration thinks Iraqi democracy is supposed to work .
Here 's the thing : Democracy means , in general , government by majority .
Iraq 's majority is religious Shia .
Ergo , under the political system we set up in Iraq , religious Shia are going to control the government .
If administration officials do n't want Iraq 's majority to actually run the country , maybe they should stop talking about democracy .
If they do * actually * believe in democracy , as opposed to " rule by people we like , " they need to come to terms with what that looks like .
Part of what it looks like is a significant role for Moqtada al - Sadr and his millions of followers .
The administration hates Sadr because he hates us , and he has frequently encouraged his followers to fight Coalition forces .
Ironically , the actual Sadrist positions are not entirely opposed to our ostensible goals for Iraq : Sadr is a nationalist , opposed to splitting up the country ; he somehow manages , despite his Mahdi Militia often attacking Sunnis , to maintain a kind of legitimacy with Sunnis ; he is not nearly as tied to Iran as other Shia leaders .
So we have a leader who is independent , nationalist , relatively free from Iranian influence , and connected to Sunni groups , and we . . . call him the most dangerous man in Iraq because he hates us .
Now , I 'm not a fan of Sadr .
I think his views on religion , rights , and , er , the rule of law are horrific .
But he 's the reality , and I prefer to deal with that than the fiction that we can isolate a group that controls the largest Shia bloc in the entire Iraqi parliament .
The Bush administration , of course , continues along in fantasyland :
Gates 's comments also unsettled Iraq strategists on the Bush team who fear that too many signals about the limits of U.S. patience could backfire , rather than induce the government of Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki to get its act together .
" If they feel we 're going to leave , they 'll cut deals with Moqtada Sadr " and other bad guys , says one Iraq expert who consults with the White House .
We do n't want Maliki to think we 're going to leave , because if he does , he 'll cut political deals with powerful leaders who can control the levels of violence and influence the civil war , which is , of course , the reason we still have nearly 150,000 troops in Iraq ?
Well , then .
One would think it 's a big story that the Bush administration does n't want a political solution in Iraq .
I suppose if they do n't recognize how democracy works in the U.S. , then I should n't expect an understanding of how it works in Iraq .
Meanwhile , though , thousands continue to die for this stupidity .
Anthony Gregory at LewRockwell.com writes about a report in today ’s Washington Post which seems to indicate that FBI agents were targetting people for arrest based on their political beliefs during a 2002 anti-war protest :
A secret FBI intelligence unit helped detain a group of war protesters in a downtown Washington parking garage in April 2002 and interrogated some of them on videotape about their political and religious beliefs , newly uncovered documents and interviews show .
For years , law enforcement authorities suggested it never happened .
The FBI and D.C. police said they had no records of such an incident .
And police told a federal court that no FBI agents were present when officers arrested more than 20 protesters that afternoon for trespassing ; police viewed them as suspicious for milling around the parking garage entrance .
But a civil lawsuit , filed by the protesters , recently unearthed D.C. police logs that confirm the FBI ’s role in the incident .
Lawyers for the demonstrators said the logs , which police say they just found , bolster their allegations of civil rights violations .
(…)
FBI agents dressed in street clothes separated members to question them one by one about protests they attended , whom they had spent time with recently , what political views they espoused and the significance of their tattoos and slogans , according to interviews and court records .
HOUSING BUBBLE UPDATE … .
The supply of homes on the market is up by a third over the past 12 months , existing homes are n’t selling , and prices are dropping .
The glut of unsold homes is the highest since 1993 and the year - over - year price decline is the biggest since 1990 .
Here are a few reactions :
Joel Naroff , Naroff Economic Advisors : “ Pop goes the housing bubble . ”
Ian Shepherdson , High Frequency Economics : “ With inventory still rising , there is no chance of any short - term relief .
Prices and volumes have a long way to fall yet . ”
Thomas Lawler , former economist at Fannie Mae : “ You ’ve got a ways to go .
You still have affordability issues in a lot of markets . ”
David Lereah , National Association of Realtors : “ This is the price correction we ’ve been expecting ?
with sales stabilizing , we should go back to positive price growth early next year . ”
Question : Can you tell which of these guys is living in a dreamworld ?
This morning ’s Washington Post is reporting that the Federal Communications Commission is days away from proposing an unprecedented expansion of government regulation of entertainment broadcasting :
Federal regulators , concerned about the effect of television violence on children , will recommend that Congress enact legislation to give the government unprecedented powers to curb violence in entertainment programming , according to government and TV industry sources .
The Federal Communications Commission has concluded that regulating TV violence is in the public interest , particularly during times when children are likely to be viewers — typically between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m. , FCC sources say .
The agency ’s recommendations — which will be released in a report to Congress within the next week , agency officials say — could set up a legal battle between Washington and the television industry .
For decades , the FCC has penalized over - the - air broadcasters for airing sexually suggestive , or “ indecent , ” speech and images , but it has never had the authority to fine TV stations and networks for violent programming .
The report — commissioned by members of Congress in 2004 and based on hundreds of comments from parents , industry officials , academic experts and others — concludes that Congress has the authority to regulate “ excessive violence ” and to extend its reach for the first time into basic - cable TV channels that consumers pay to receive .
As the article goes on to point out there are several problems with what the FCC is proposing that should concern anyone who believes in freedom of speech and property rights .
First of all , just how do you define “ excessive violence ” ?
Are we talking about Jack Bauer ’s torture scenes on 24 ?
What about the very life - like dead bodies we see on a regular basis on Law & Order and CSI ?
For that matter , what about the autopsy scenes on shows like CSI ?
Yes , these shows are excessive , but in each one of them , the violence is n’t gratuitous , it ’s a part of the plot and often — as in the case of torture scenes on 24 that seldom yield useful information — make a point completely opposite from what you might initially think .
And even if you can come up with a constitutionally acceptable definition of violence , how do you objectively determine what ’s excessive ?
You can’t , of course , because the question of what is and is n’t excessive is entirely subjective .
What I think is excessive will be different from what you think is excessive .
In a way , it ’s even worse than trying to define what is and is n’t obscene , which has led to an entire generation of Supreme Court litigation .
But there is another problem with what the FCC proposes .
Essentially what the regulators of the FCC are saying is that you and I are incapable as parents , guardians , or family members from deciding what is appropriate for children ( and apparently are also incapable of using the off button or channel changer on the remote control ) .
Adam D. Thierer , a senior fellow at the Progress & Freedom Foundation who writes extensively on government regulation of the media , said the answer to preventing children from seeing violent content is in the hands of the parents — literally .
“ There are more ways to control violent and objectionable content on cable and satellite television than ever before , ” Thierer said .
“ Every single set - top - box technology on the market has some sort of parental - control mechanism embedded in it . ”
Where is the evidence that the government can do a better job than parents at monitoring what children watch and limiting their access to inappropriate material , whether it ’s violent or not ?
Fortunately , it does n’t appear that anything on the scale of what the FCC is proposing would pass muster in the Courts :
Thierer said that if Congress were to pass laws that empower the FCC or another agency to regulate basic - cable channels for violent content , they likely would not stand legal challenges brought by the cable industry .
He drew an analogy to local and federal attempts to regulate violent content in video games , which — like cable and satellite television — do not come into the home free over the airwaves .
“ Every single one of them was struck down as unconstitutional , ” Thierer said .
Further , in 2000 the Supreme Court struck down part of the Communications Decency
Act that required cable operators to scramble or block the Playboy Channel , saying such methods are unconstitutional .
Of course , that ’s the same thing people were saying about McCain - Feingold and looks what happened there .
EPISODE SYNOPSIS :
The Red Phone enables the pidjins to call the president and make him press the red button .
Did you see that the average bonus at Goldman was $ 622,000 for a year ’s work ?
Arnold Kling asks why here , and here , with follow - up from M. Drapier .
The puzzle , of course , is why the supply of investment banking does n’t expand so as to lower price and thus wages , in what appears to be a fairly competitive industry .
My take :
The high payments solve an agency problem and align interests , and thus they are relatively invariant to competitive pressures .
If Goldman does an IPO , the issuing company wants to make sure that Goldman promotes the issue properly .
This means , among other things , that Goldman eschews pure market - clearing prices and instead places the issue in the hands of investors who will talk it up and promote it .
For this to happen , Goldman has to care more about its relationship with the hiring , security - issuing firm than about some of its external relationships , namely other groups which would like to buy into the offering at favorable prices but which would not promote it as effectively ( NB : this is not the only relevant conflict of interest problem , it is just an example ) .
In other words , the company doing the IPO has to pay Goldman lots to ensure their loyalty .
Competition for doing IPOs wo n’t much lower the required payments needed to capture the loyalty of Goldman .
There could be one million talented investment bankers bidding to do that issue , and ex post the security - issuing firm will still pay the winner large sums to align incentives in the desired manner .
Scientists as far back as Isaac Newton have investigated how a sand pile ’s properties depend on the way the individual grains are arranged .
Newton , possibly motivated in part by financial considerations associated with his own apple orchard , studied the various ways spherical objects could be densely packed .
For example , random pouring fills an apple barrel to the rim , but inefficiently .
Mechanical vibrations cause the apples to adjust their positions , filling open gaps and moving closer together .
Barrels topped off at the orchard are thus only partly filled when they arrive at the market .
This phenomenon also explains the warning you see on breakfast cereal boxes that “ contents may have settled during shipping . ”
With every shake , granular material becomes more densely packed , eventually tending toward the close - packed state .
With all the grains as near to one another as possible , 26 percent of the volume is still gaps , but the substance is extremely rigid — as anyone who has hefted a vacuum - sealed pound of coffee can attest .
The difference between the lightest , fluffiest packing and the densest state corresponds to an inter - grain spacing variation of only 10 percent .
Yet it takes many vibrations to change from one state to the other .
Physicists at the University of Chicago have found that a container of beads will not have reached its final limit of density even after more than a million jolts .
It ’s probably for the best that Sandman is made of only one type of sand .
Even the cleverest comic book creators might be stumped by the behavior of granular mixtures .
If you put both large and small beads in a cylinder , tip it on its side and rotate it around its horizontal axis , the contents will spontaneously segregate into alternating bands of large and small beads , like rings on a finger .
This counterintuitive de-mixing phenomenon , called axial segregation , complicates efforts by the pharmaceutical industry to combine drug powders in drum mixers .
Even though sand is everywhere — and seems to get into everything — scientists have yet to elucidate all its properties .
The insights they have gained so far about granular media have had important applications in the construction , agricultural and pharmaceutical industries .
And our improving understanding of the stacking , flowing and mixing of grains and powders is also likely to affect the lives of nearly everyone .
It may help a certain friendly neighborhood Spider - Man in his battles with granular supervillains , too .

After a bit of time to bake and a few more suggestions from readers , I have what I ’m willing to call the final version of my take on the topic of reset styles .
To wit :
html , body , div , span , applet , object , iframe , h1 , h2 , h3 , h4 , h5 , h6 , p , blockquote , pre , a , abbr , acronym , address , big , cite , code , del , dfn , em , font , img , ins , kbd , q , s , samp , small , strike , strong , sub , sup , tt , var , dl , dt , dd , ol , ul , li , fieldset , form , label , legend , table , caption , tbody , tfoot , thead , tr , th , td { margin : 0 ; padding : 0 ; border : 0 ; outline : 0 ; font - weight : inherit ; font - style : inherit ; font - size : 100 % ; font - family : inherit ; vertical - align : baseline ; } /* remember to define focus styles ! */ : focus { outline : 0 ; } body { line - height : 1 ; color : black ; background : white ; } ol , ul { list - style : none ; } /* tables still need ' cellspacing= " 0 " ' in the markup */ table { border - collapse : separate ; border - spacing : 0 ; } caption , th , td { text - align : left ; font - weight : normal ; } blockquote : before , blockquote : after , q:before , q: after { content : " " ; } blockquote , q { quotes : " " " " ; }
So what changed from the last iteration ?
I added background : transparent ; to the first rule .
It ’s probably not as necessary as some of the other bits here , but it seemed like a good thing to add .
Added a : focus rule to try to suppress link outlining .
Why ?
So that you remember to define your own .
You should make sure to define an outline , as it ’s an important accessibility aid .
If you have a universal default , one that applies no matter what the project , then replace my rule with your own .
There ’s now a body rule that sets a baseline line - height that will be inherited by the rest of the document ( and can be overridden easily ) , and sets a foreground and background color .
Originally , I avoided setting the colors , but decided it was better to put them in .
Of course , if you have preferred color defaults other than black on white , edit the declarations to suit your taste .
The a img , : link img , : visited img rule has been dropped .
This is because the only browser family it really affects is Gecko line , and they all honor author styles as having precedent over user agent styles ( as they should ! ) .
So this is already covered by the first rule .
Added a rule for caption , th , td to be left - aligned and normal - weight .
Added a blockquote , q rule to suppress quotes by way of the quotes property .
This has the same intent as the previous rule , but approaches it along a different route .
I also asked for help in figuring out how to simulate inherit in IE / Win .
In the end , it seems to me like doing so is n’t really necessary for most people .
As I said before :
[ The inherit ] effects , as seen in my development environment , will still serve the purpose of reminding me to build up the styles I actually want , and not use the browsers ’ defaults as a crutch .
There is the possibility of my forgetting that ( for example ) IE / Win italicizes em when I do n’t want it to , but that ’s something I ’ll catch during the browser testing phase .
So that works for me , and I think for most people who have outlooks similar to mine .
But maybe you develop primarily in IE / Win , or you really want to have IE / Win handle as many of these resets as humanly possible .
In that case , you have two basic choices .
Use the script and syntax contributed by Jonathan Snook and Dean Edwards .
Note , however , that Dean himself does n’t recommend doing this , feeling that it ’s too computationally expensive for such a small effect .
Dean has a lot of experience with scripting around IE / Win ’s limitations , so I give his views on this a lot of weight .
On the other hand , I ’d like to see IE / Win be able to honor inherit , or at least get the same behavior , so I might still use the script .
( Though I ’d be even happier with a script that just tacked itself onto instance of inherit in a style sheet , like Dean ’s IE7 script does for other CSS stuff . )
Put in your own expressions , along the lines suggested by Priit and thacker .
It ’s not quite the same thing , but it ’s a pretty decent approximation .
Like I say , these are n’t necessary unless you ’re really sold on the idea of IE / Win being forced into line with everyone else and do n’t mind paying the computational overhead .
If so , then you can extend your own reset styles as needed .
That ’s much of the point here : that this is not a case of “ everyone must use these styles in a certain way without alteration ” .
Nor am I saying that everyone must use them or else be cast into darkness .
Remember before that I termed these “ my take on the topic of reset styles ” ( emphasis added ) .
Your take may be subtly or greatly different .
Think of these as a starting point for creating your own defaults , in addition to being a way to illuminate the nature of browser defaults .
Simply the act of taking those defaults into consideration and thinking about them closely puts you ahead of 99 % of your peers .
I do think that reset styles are quite useful ; otherwise , I would n’t have written about them here , and certainly not to the extent that I have .
My hope is that people will use them as a launch pad for their own resets and for deeper thinking about styling and browsers .
My thanks to everyone who commented , not just those I linked above .
And yes , I ’m going to get to that “ weirdness of form elements ” post in the near future .
Addendum 2 May 07 : I edited the CSS to change background : transparent to background - image : transparent , as it was supposed to be from the outset but I somehow did n’t see in any of the three times I looked over the declarations .
So I guess that makes this post now “ final.0.1 ” .
Even as computer modeling of global climate change has continually improved , global warming doubters have criticized projections for the future as being little more than educated guesses .
But the latest report from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , released this month , shows that even earlier and cruder models accurately predicted global temperature increases .
When the IPCC released its first report in 1990 , the panel ’s models , which are simple by today ’s standards , correctly predicted the increase in global temperature measured over the last 17 years .
Their latest report revealed a 0.36 degrees Fahrenheit ( 0.2 degrees Celsius ) per decade increase during that time , which fits within the 0.27 to 0.54 F degrees per decade increase ( 0.15 to 0.3 degrees Celsius ) they predicted .
“ If you just look at the global mean temperature , [ the projection ] is relatively straightforward to do , ” said climate modeler Reto Knutti , a visiting scientist at the National Center for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colo . who worked on the report .
Even John Christy , a climate scientist at the University of Alabama in Huntsville who has spoken out against the IPCC report in the past , admitted that global mean temperature was “ as sure as anything in the prediction of climate . ”
While he thought that the IPCC ’s reported warming over the last too decades was too high , he agreed that his own measurements also fit within the range of earlier projections .
The reason the projections are straightforward , according to Knutti , is that the way climate behaves in the next twenty or thirty years depends almost entirely on what humans have already done .
The “ committed warming ” of short - term models , as he calls it , is largely independent of new policies or changes .
“ Because you know the past , this is , in some way , pre-determined , ” he said .
Predicting global climate change for the next 20 years is actually easier than making a weekend weather forecast .
“ You do n’t have to know the weather to predict the climate , ” said Knutti .
“ The difference between weather and climate is an important one , ” he cautioned .
Even if we can’t accurately predict if it will snow next week , said Knutti , “ we can perfectly predict that next winter will be colder than next summer . ”
Similarly , climate change represents a change in averages over long time scales .
Although the 1990 models worked , they lacked many of the sophisticated features of today ’s models , which include complex processes like the effect of aerosols .
These tiny particles suspended in the air are especially important in understanding climate change , because they can both cool or warm the planet under different conditions .
“ At that time [ 1990 ] , climate models were just beginning to include aerosols , ” said atmospheric physicist Surabi Menon , a contributing author to one of the chapters of the report who works in the Lawrence Berkeley National Lab in Berkeley , Calif .
Better observational data from satellites have driven much of the improvement in aerosol modeling .
Now almost all models treat aerosols as a mixture that can interact rather than individual particles , according to Menon , who collaborates on climate models with the Goddard Institute of Space Studies in New York .
In addition to affecting the climate through their presence in the atmosphere , aerosols can alter the amount of precipitation released by clouds and the size of their droplets .
“ The clouds are really the most complicated part , ” explained Knutti , noting that they are still responsible for much of the remaining uncertainty in projections .
“ We ’re getting much better observational data on the clouds , ” said Knutti .
“ These observations just were n’t available twenty years ago . ”
While models and observations have improved since the initial report , the primary conclusions have changed little .
Scientists like Knutti and Menon are confident in the continued warming of 0.36 degrees Fahrenheit per decade for the next few decades predicted by the new report .
“ It ’s important to start making decisions today , ” said Knutti .
“ If you wait for 20 years , you will not be able to change your path very dramatically . ”

There 's good news coming out of the FCC for radio fans ; news that 's sorely needed after two bits of
negative
news this past week .
The FCC has published its rules for Digital Audio
Broadcasting ( DAB ) , and the big news is what 's not in the rules : the broadcast flag .
The FCC made a number of important decisions with regards to DAB , but none of them touched the sensitive issue of requiring encryption and end - user control schemes for digital radio .
The FCC 's silence on the matter means that should the RIAA still wish to chase after the broadcast flag for digital radio , they 'll need to lobby Congress to get it .
The jury is out on whether or not there 's any chance of Congress pushing something like that through , but since last year 's elections there seems to be more skepticism in Congress with regards to the entertainment industry 's technology plans .
And make no mistake : the clock is ticking on this one .
Digital radio has the clear go - ahead now ( previous offerings were on a limited , case - by - case basis ) , and the time for implementing such a thing is quickly passing because of the equipment setup involved .
The announcement also indicates that the FCC ( PDF of the announcement ) chose to refrain from establishing a mandatory conversion schedule for digital radio , and a number of other changes seem largely favorable for the industry .
FCC commissioner Robert M. McDowell called the FCC 's decision " historic , " as it now paves the way for digital radio to roll out across the country and in fairly laissez - faire fashion .
This concise report by Glenn Fleishman covers most of those issues , and I also recommend this write - up by Brad Kava at the Mercury News .
Capture the Flag
For more than a year there has been a battle between the RIAA and the National Association of Broadcasters ( NAB ) over the issue of protecting content on digital radio .
The issue centers around digital radio's quality : DAB will provide static - free , near - CD quality broadcasts , and the RIAA and friends are worried that this will enable users to merely record radio and never buy a CD again .
The big problem with the RIAA 's demand for a broadcast flag was that they missed the boat .
While radio stations were prepping for this move for years , the RIAA twiddled its thumbs .
Only at the 11th hour did they step in and then ask for changes .
A broadcast flag solution would have required end - to - end encryption , which would have required significant changes to digital radio broadcasting equipment .
To make matters worse , there are already digital radio players on the market , and a move to a broadcast flag would have rendered them useless .
The RIAA will likely still fight for a broadcast flag for radio , but the FCC 's decision makes it plain that they would prefer to see digital radio get out of the gate sooner rather than later , and they remain satisfied that the rollout should begin immediately and without worry for the added complications of a broadcast flag .

Joel Surnow calls the show he helped create “ patriotic . ”
Photograph by Martin Schoeller .
The office desk of Joel Surnow — the co-creator and executive producer of “ 24 , ” the popular counterterrorism drama on Fox — faces a wall dominated by an American flag in a glass case .
A small label reveals that the flag once flew over Baghdad , after the American invasion of Iraq , in 2003 .
A few years ago , Surnow received it as a gift from an Army regiment stationed in Iraq ; the soldiers had shared a collection of “ 24 ” DVDs , he told me , until it was destroyed by an enemy bomb .
“ The military loves our show , ” he said recently .
Surnow is fifty - two , and has the gangly , coiled energy of an athlete ; his hair is close - cropped , and he has a “ soul patch ” — a smidgen of beard beneath his lower lip .
When he was young , he worked as a carpet salesman with his father .
The trick to selling anything , he learned , is to carry yourself with confidence and get the customer to like you within the first five minutes .
He ’s got it down .
“ People in the Administration love the series , too , ” he said .
“ It ’s a patriotic show .
They should love it . ”
Surnow ’s production company , Real Time Entertainment , is in the San Fernando Valley , and occupies a former pencil factory : a bland , two - story industrial building on an abject strip of parking lots and fast - food restaurants .
Surnow , a cigar enthusiast , has converted a room down the hall from his office into a salon with burled - wood humidors and a full bar ; his friend Rush Limbaugh , the conservative talk - radio host , sometimes joins him there for a smoke .
( Not long ago , Surnow threw Limbaugh a party and presented him with a custom - made “ 24 ” smoking jacket . )
The ground floor of the factory has a large soundstage on which many of “ 24 ” ’s interior scenes are shot , including those set at the perpetually tense Los Angeles bureau of the Counter Terrorist Unit , or C.T.U. — a fictional federal agency that pursues America ’s enemies with steely resourcefulness .
Each season of “ 24 , ” which has been airing on Fox since 2001 , depicts a single , panic - laced day in which Jack Bauer — a heroic C.T.U. agent , played by Kiefer Sutherland — must unravel and undermine a conspiracy that imperils the nation .
Terrorists are poised to set off nuclear bombs or bioweapons , or in some other way annihilate entire cities .
The twisting story line forces Bauer and his colleagues to make a series of grim choices that pit liberty against security .
Frequently , the dilemma is stark : a resistant suspect can either be accorded due process — allowing a terrorist plot to proceed — or be tortured in pursuit of a lead .
Bauer invariably chooses coercion .
With unnerving efficiency , suspects are beaten , suffocated , electrocuted , drugged , assaulted with knives , or more exotically abused ; almost without fail , these suspects divulge critical secrets .
The show ’s appeal , however , lies less in its violence than in its giddily literal rendering of a classic thriller trope : the “ ticking time bomb ” plot .
Each hour - long episode represents an hour in the life of the characters , and every minute that passes onscreen brings the United States a minute closer to doomsday .
( Surnow came up with this concept , which he calls the show ’s “ trick . ” )
As many as half a dozen interlocking stories unfold simultaneously — frequently on a split screen — and a digital clock appears before and after every commercial break , marking each second with an ominous clang .
The result is a riveting sensation of narrative velocity .
Bob Cochran , who created the show with Surnow , admitted , “ Most terrorism experts will tell you that the ‘ ticking time bomb ’ situation never occurs in real life , or very rarely .
But on our show it happens every week . ”
According to Darius Rejali , a professor of political science at Reed College and the author of the forthcoming book “ Torture and Democracy , ” the conceit of the ticking time bomb first appeared in Jean Lartéguy ’s 1960 novel “ Les Centurions , ” written during the brutal French occupation of Algeria .
The book ’s hero , after beating a female Arab dissident into submission , uncovers an imminent plot to explode bombs all over Algeria and must race against the clock to stop it .
Rejali , who has examined the available records of the conflict , told me that the story has no basis in fact .
In his view , the story line of “ Les Centurions ” provided French liberals a more palatable rationale for torture than the racist explanations supplied by others ( such as the notion that the Algerians , inherently simpleminded , understood only brute force ) .
Lartéguy ’s scenario exploited an insecurity shared by many liberal societies — that their enlightened legal systems had made them vulnerable to security threats .
“ 24 , ” which last year won an Emmy Award for Outstanding Drama Series , packs an improbable amount of intrigue into twenty - four hours , and its outlandishness marks it clearly as a fantasy , an heir to the baroque potboilers of Tom Clancy and Vince Flynn .
Nevertheless , the show obviously plays off the anxieties that have beset the country since September 11th , and it sends a political message .
The series , Surnow told me , is “ ripped out of the Zeitgeist of what people ’s fears are — their paranoia that we ’re going to be attacked , ” and it “ makes people look at what we ’re dealing with ” in terms of threats to national security .
“ There are not a lot of measures short of extreme measures that will get it done , ” he said , adding , “ America wants the war on terror fought by Jack Bauer .
He ’s a patriot . ”
For all its fictional liberties , “ 24 ” depicts the fight against Islamist extremism much as the Bush Administration has defined it : as an all - consuming struggle for America ’s survival that demands the toughest of tactics .
Not long after September 11th , Vice - President Dick Cheney alluded vaguely to the fact that America must begin working through the “ dark side ” in countering terrorism .
On “ 24 , ” the dark side is on full view .
Surnow , who has jokingly called himself a “ right - wing nut job , ” shares his show ’s hard - line perspective .
Speaking of torture , he said , “ Is n’t it obvious that if there was a nuke in New York City that was about to blow — or any other city in this country — that , even if you were going to go to jail , it would be the right thing to do ? ”
Since September 11th , depictions of torture have become much more common on American television .
Before the attacks , fewer than four acts of torture appeared on prime - time television each year , according to Human Rights First , a nonprofit organization .
Now there are more than a hundred , and , as David Danzig , a project director at Human Rights First , noted , “ the torturers have changed .
It used to be almost exclusively the villains who tortured .
Today , torture is often perpetrated by the heroes . ”
The Parents ’ Television Council , a nonpartisan watchdog group , has counted what it says are sixty - seven torture scenes during the first five seasons of “ 24 ” — more than one every other show .
Melissa Caldwell , the council ’s senior director of programs , said , “ ‘ 24 ’ is the worst offender on television : the most frequent , most graphic , and the leader in the trend of showing the protagonists using torture . ”
The show ’s villains usually inflict the more gruesome tortures : their victims are hung on hooks , like carcasses in a butcher shop ; poked with smoking - hot scalpels ; or abraded with sanding machines .
In many episodes , however , heroic American officials act as tormentors , even though torture is illegal under U.S. law .
( The United Nations Convention Against Torture , which took on the force of federal law when it was ratified by the Senate in 1994 , specifies that “ no exceptional circumstances , whatsoever , whether a state of war or a threat of war , internal political instability or any other public emergency , may be invoked as a justification of torture . ” )
In one episode , a fictional President commands a member of his Secret Service to torture a suspected traitor : his national - security adviser .

We web designers get excited about the littlest things .
Our friends in the print world must get a kick out of watching us talk about finally being able to achieve layouts on the web that they ’ve taken for granted for years .
Let ’s face it : it ’s easier these days to embed a video on the web than it is to set type consistently or align elements to a universal grid .
Article Continues Below
But we ’re scrappy folks , web designers .
We do n’t give up easy .
In the long slow battle with browser support and platform inconsistencies , we ’ve been able to bring more and more sophisticated print techniques onto the web — sometimes kicking and screaming .
We have the technology # section2
Over the last year or so , there ’s been a lot of talk about grid systems and using column grids for website layouts .
Mark gave us a lesson plan , Khoi gave us a case study and Cameron gave us a toolkit .
The message is clear : we have the browser support , the know - how , and the tools we need to create consistent multi-column grid layouts on the web .
We can apply the same principles of proportion and balance to the type within those columns by borrowing another technique from our print brethren : the baseline grid .
The main principle of the baseline grid is that the bottom of every line of text ( the baseline ) falls on a vertical grid set in even increments all the way down the page .
Imagine those old Big Chief ruled writing pads they gave you in grade school to practice penmanship and you ’ve got the basic idea .
The magical end result is that all the text on your page lines up across all the columns , creating a harmonious vertical rhythm .
In print , it ’s not that hard .
Just enable the baseline grid in Quark or InDesign and set the increment based on the line - height you want .
On the web of course , it ’s another story .
It ’s hard enough to align things vertically with CSS because it ’s tough to predict where every element will fall , and it only gets worse when we ’re dealing with type , which is hard enough to size consistently on its own .
But with a little math and a slightly obsessive attention to detail , we can make it work .
Firing up the grid#section3
Note : I ’ve used pixel units for sizing text in the examples for this article .
Recognizing that this may be a surprising recommendation for an article in this publication , I ’ve addressed some of my reasons for doing so — as well as some alternate techniques that use relative units — further down .
The first thing we have to do is set a line - height for our grid .
I ’ve chosen a pretty standard base font size of 12 pixels , and set the line - height at 18 pixels , which gives us a nice open leading of about 150 % .
It ’s important to think about your line - heights up front .
You want a ratio of font size to line - height that ’s a good balance for readability and that ’s easily divisible into smaller units ( more on this later ) .
I ’ve also borrowed a trick from Khoi and created a tiling background image that I can use on the page while I ’m working to make sure everything lines up where I want it to .
You can see the end result with the grid turned on in this example .
You ’ll notice in the previous example that the text does n’t fall directly on the grid lines .
Because of the way CSS renders line - height ( by adding space above and below the letters ) it ’s a lot easier to line the text up within the grid lines rather than directly on them .
It ’s possible to adjust your background image to take this into account , or tweak the padding on certain elements so the text starts in a different place , but there ’s no point making this more complicated than it needs to be .
Paragraphs and headers #section4
I ’ll start by resetting the margin and padding on everything to zero so we do n’t have to worry about default browser styles .
In practice , you ’ll probably want to use something a little more precise , but for the purposes of this example , a good old star selector will do just fine .
* { margin : 0 ; padding : 0 ; }
We want space between paragraphs , but the default top and bottom margins of 1em ( which works out in this case to 12 pixels ) wo n’t work with our 18 pixel grid , so we ’ll set the bottom margin on paragraphs to 18 pixels .
p { margin - bottom : 18 px ; }
As we set the font size for headers , we also need to set appropriate line - heights in multiples of 18 , as well as adding the 18 pixel bottom margin .
h1 { font - size : 24 px ; line - height : 36 px ; margin - bottom : 18 px ; } h2 { font - size : 18 px ; line - height : 18 px ; margin - bottom : 18 px ; } h3 { font - size : 12 px ; line - height : 18 px ; }
The pattern is pretty simple .
Any time you add vertical space with a margin or padding , you need to add it in units of 18 pixels to maintain the baseline grid .
You do n’t always have to add it in one place , but you need to add it in pairs that add up to 18 pixels .
For instance , you could set a top margin of 12 pixels and a bottom margin of 6 pixels .
Lists are a little bit tougher .
We ’re used to adding a little padding between each list item and before or after a nested list .
Depending on your grid size , you may have to choose between adding a lot of extra space ( adding a full grid line ) or adding none at all and letting list items fall on the regular grid lines .
Since the 18 - pixel line - height we started with is pretty generous , the “ none at all ” option works pretty well here .
I ’ll just add the bottom margin of 18 pixels .
ul , ol { margin - bottom : 18 px ; }
As for nested lists , it ’s possible to add half of your line - height ( in this case , 9 pixels ) of margin above and below nested lists .
Adding half a line to the top and another half to the bottom means the contents of the list will be “ off the grid , ” but the grid will get back on track once the list ends .
It ’s a compromise , but sometimes worth it for designs in which you need to accommodate especially long or complicated nested lists .
Floats and sidebars #section6
Here ’s where a little discipline comes in .
Images and other elements floated within your text need to be sized vertically in multiples of your grid increment : in this case , multiples of 18 .
If they ’re sized correctly , you can add margins around them that add up vertically to a multiple of 18 , and the text will always break in the right place , directly under your image .
. left { float : left ; margin : 0 18 px 18px 0 ; } .right { float : right ; margin : 0 0 18 px 18 px ; }
Other floated elements like callout boxes are a little bit more complicated , since it ’s harder to predict their height based on the content inside .
As long as all text and images inside the float follow the 18 - pixel rules , and you always add vertical padding and margins in groups that add up to 18 , everything should line up no matter what you put inside .
. callout { border : 1 px solid #ddd ; padding : 8 px 10 px ; margin - bottom : 18 px ; }
Notice that I added 8 pixels of padding to the top and bottom of the floated element , since the border width already accounted for 2 pixels of added height ( 8 + 8 + 1 + 1 = 18 ) .
I ’m also going to suck out the bottom margin on the last element in the callout so we do n’t end up with too much extra space inside .
This is n’t a critical layout feature ( the grid is still intact without it ) , so I ’ll go ahead and use the : last - child pseudo class since it does n’t require me to add any extra markup .
IE6 wo n’t get it , but it wo n’t break the layout .
. callout : last - child { margin- bottom : 0 ; }
The important thing to remember with callouts and sidebars is to keep the line - height the same even if you make the text smaller .
You might be tempted to tighten it up , but even for 11 - or 10 - pixel font sizes , 18 pixels is still a very readable line - height .
All your baseline are belong to us#section7
You can see it all put together in this example .
If you do n’t believe me , put your rulers away and check it out with the background grid visible .
You can start to see why baseline grids are n’t used very often on the web .
It ’s pretty tough to keep up with it — especially as your layouts get more complicated — and we ’ve only touched the surface of some of the relatively manageable challenges .
Just as in print , baseline grids are not always the right choice for every layout , and sometimes you need to make exceptions or exclude certain elements from the grid to make a layout work .
But it ’s definitely possible , and something that ’s worth experimenting with , especially in combination with a horizontal or column grid .
A nice balanced baseline grid — even just within the main content area — can add polish and readability as we move typesetting on the web to the next generation with CSS3 and beyond .
Do n’t fear the pixel #section8
One final note on font sizing : I ’m using pixels instead of ems in this example for one reason : it makes everything simpler .
With pixels , I can set one base line - height for the entire document and I do n’t have to recalculate it whenever I use a smaller font size .
When designing a practical system like this , it ’s important that it ’s relatively easy ( for yourself and others ) to use and maintain .
You can use relative sizes , but it quickly becomes a lot more difficult to maintain as the math becomes more complicated .
It ’s easy to get 12 out of 18 ( just set the line - height to 1.5 em ) , but when you want to adjust the text size but keep the same line - height , the fractions start to get messy , and predicting how browsers are going to round your values makes it hard to be exact .
It ’s certainly possible however , and if you ’re interested in trying something similar with relative text sizes , I ’d recommend checking out Richard Rutter ’s excellent 24 ways article , Compose to a Vertical Rhythm .
In the end , it ’s a tradeoff .
Most browsers will scale pixel - based line - heights proportionally along with the text .
Of course , the margins do n’t scale , and neither do the images .
But is it worth making the system more complicated just to make the margins scale if the images do n’t ?
It depends on the situation .
In the end , it ’s up to you .
At some point as designers we have to strike a balance between creating pixel - perfect layouts and infinitely flexible ones .
When you get down to it , resizable text is primarily an accessibility feature , not a design feature .
Ideally it ’s something that should be provided by the browser , no matter how the page is built , and in modern browsers it is .
As long as all your content is readable and accessible at all sizes , it ’s not necessarily true that the design must maintain integrity as you scale .

1. Government should be the " solution of last resort "
At what level of Government does the best fit soultion lie ?
" The United States - a federal system in which the citizens of each individual state are sovereign - has been replaced , over time , by a unitary and imperious federal government that is daily becoming more intrusive .
As a consequence we are rapidly losing touch with our democracy , for deciding issues of political significance on a human scale - where both the causes and the consequences of collective action are within ordinary citizens ' grasp - is the oxygen of democracy " Prof.
Frank Bryan , UVM Professor of Political ScienceDamn , that rings true does n't it .
Prof.
Bryan has been quite supportive of a long standing Vermont movement to secede from the union .
Vermont was once an independant republic , prior to becoming a state .
Only Texas shares that unique claim to fame .
Think about it , when you really get down to the heart of most any political debate , the idea of more localized government seems to be at least part of the solution , sometimes all of it .
Pick a hot topic : health care , welfare , taxes , education .
Now ... would n't it be easier to find a workable solution to the problem at hand if the scope was just your municipality or state ?
Yes , is the answer i come up with 90 % of the time .
Furthermore , there is a legitimate body of thought that believes this is exactly what the founding fathers intended .
Certainly in some cases , it makes sense to let Washington handle the problem ( Defense , certain business regulation etc . . )
There do exist efficiencies and practical reasons to leave something up to the Feds .
I am not quite sold on the idea of secession , but taking the middle road : I propose two tests before handing a responsibility or task to any governement entity , particularly to Washington :
Does the government really need to be doing this ?
Is the free market failing in this function .
Are non-profits , business , communities , families etc.. proving to be unable to achieve a goal that the majority of voters believe should be achieved .
Too often , I hear politicians rationalizing the need for new government program or regulation simply based on the presence of a problem .
But just because a problem exists .. it certainly does n't mean that the solution should be the responsibility of government .
There are many ways to solve a problem ... lets not forget .
But
We the People are so susceptible to instant gratification , that when a politician says they are going to take care of everything , we are too ready to abide .
There are no easy solutions .
Just like the fraud awareness public service announcements : " If it sounds too good to be true , it probably is " 2.
So let 's say we passed the first test and we agree that we have an issue that is most efficiently handled by government .
Do n't just allow Washington to deal with at a federal level , passing one law or regulation that applies to Arkansas and Alaska , East L.A. and Liberty , Vermont .
Start local and move on up until the best fit is found .
I have worked in government , and can see that adding laws , employees , departments etc .. is largely a one way street .
Hiring someone and starting a new governmental program is easily done once the public is behind the goal .
But when it fails to deliver , trying to shrink government is a monumnetal task .
So , let 's not add to the beast unless we are darn sure it 's a good deal for all .
Lets take our time .
Do it for the children !
Update : TOR roundup
The public prosecutor ’s office of Konstanz raided computing centres of seven providers in Germany , seizing ten servers because of the proliferation of child pornography .
Nothing new , things like that happen all the time , the juicy detail is that some of the servers were merely running a copy of the TOR , a software to anonymize the usage of the internet to protect your privacy .
Those servers were most probably configured to be TOR Exit - Nodes , so their IP - addresses might have shown up in the server logfiles of the child - porn servers in question .
One could argue that this is an attempt to frigthen german TOR - node operators , but I ’d just keep calm for the moment .
I guess that the attorney of state is just after logfiles , they knew that those servers were operating as TOR - nodes .
If you IP - address pops up in a child - porn case surely your IP looks interesting to the police .
However , this situation is disturbing , really disturbing .
I run a TOR - server myself ( wormhole.ynfonatic.de ) and the last thing I want to experience is the police kicking down my door , seizing my computer .
( despite the fact that my server is rented and in Leipzig i do n’t want them to raid my appartment .
Child - porn , you know , the last reason .
You could possibly justify everything with it . )
One operator whose server was seized as well wrote a letter to all the TOR - operators in Germany he was aware of , reaching me as well ; he wrote that he is not aware of any charges pressed against him at the moment and that his provider , whose server - room was raided , was not avilable for a real comment on the weekend .
We just have to wait what ’s going on , which charges are pressed – if at all , i somehow doubt that – and when the state will give that servers back .
This is really something horrible for the TOR - operator – especially if you take into account that there will be no evidences at all to find on the harddrive .
It ’s just a hassle , stress which is put upon you .
But i guess we have to go through it .
There was no lawsuit about TOR in Germany yet – i hope it ’s not going into the direction of “ supporting proliferation of child - pornography “ .
This would be the end of anonymizing services in Germany and probably everywhere in the EU .
I run TOR to get a certain level of privacy .
Staying anonymous is no crime .
I want my privacy .
Please morally support us , the TOR - operators .
Fellow Blogger rabenhorst also wrote a bit about it .
Update : Subscribing to the tor - talk list helps …

GOP GDP -
First quarter " real " GDP growth in the United States hit a two and a half year high :
4.8 % .
That 's not half bad , and while it 's not likely that we 'll sustain that sort of growth throughout the entire year , let 's just compare 4.8 % to the recent growth in " comparable nations " comment - sniper Michael Tam prefers ( Australia , UK , Canada , France , and Germany ) , as well as a few others ( Italy , Japan , Belgium , the Netherlands , Sweden , Denmark , and the European Union ) .
Using the latest data from the CIA World Factbook , here 's the comparison :
Of course , just for reference , Angola grew at a 19.1 % pace in 2005 , China grew 9.3 % , India grew 7.6 % , Hong Kong grew 6.9 % , and Singapore grew 5.7 % .
Zimbabwe , meanwhile , contracted to the tune of 7 % .
But let 's get back to that 4.8 % " real " GDP growth in the United States .
That " real " number , which is pegged to 2000 dollars for the sake of consistency and comparability , is fantastic , but in current dollars , the annual growth rate was actually 8.2 % .
In three months , the American economy added 254.8 BILLION dollars to its annual economic output .
In twelve months , the American economy added 822.1 BILLION dollars to its annual economic output .
Let 's think about what those $ 254.8 billion and $ 822.1 billion numbers mean .
254.8 billion dollars compares closely to the entire economy of Hong Kong -- or of Switzerland .
It 's also greater than the respective economies of Vietnam , Malaysia , Greece , Portugal , Norway , the Czech Republic , Chile , Denmark , Venezuela , Israel , and Ireland , just to name a handful .
In the first quarter of 2006 alone , the American economy added what amounts to the entirety of the island economies of Singapore , New Zealand , Bahrain , and Iceland , combined .
That 's not insignificant at all .
Of course , it 's even more fun to play with the 822.1 billion dollar figure .
You can add the entire economies of Saudi Arabia , Belgium , Lebanon , Honduras , Croatia , and Kuwait , with room to spare .
Then , again , if you want to use the " real " dollar gains , rather than current dollar ones , in the first quarter , it 's only an addition of 133.1 billion dollars .
In that case , the United States only added a Nigeria 's worth of economy in those three months .
Still not insignificant , at all .
When the largest economy in the world grows at a 4.8 % annual " real " rate , and 8.2 % annual current - dollar rate , it ought to be the top news story , everywhere , all weekend long .
We 've added several countries - worth of economy to our own in just the past three months .
That 's HUGE news .
The consequences of such economic growth are rife -- and profound .
For one , our national debt burden seems a little more manageable .
Our ability to project power and influence in the world ( as well as take care of things at home ) increases substantially .
Incidentally , Reuters is underselling America 's economy by roughly 15 % :
Economists generally consider the long - term sustainable growth rate for America 's $ 11 - trillion economy to be around 3.5 percent .
Hello , Reuters , and welcome to 2003 ; the rest of us have since moved beyond an $ 11 trillion economy to more than $ 13 trillion .
Two trillion dollars might not seem like a lot to the moneybags working over at Reuters , but , dad gum it , two trillion still means something on this blog .
Of course , the Reuters explanation would be that they are using the " 2000 - chained dollars " ( 11,381,400,000,000 ) figure instead of " current dollars " ( $ 13,020,900,000,000 ) .
Either way , come on , Reuters , stop living 3 years ( if we 're talking about current dollars ) or 6 years ago ( if " real " dollars are the way to go ) , and stop , in so many other subtle and not - so - subtle ways , underplaying the amazing American economy already .
" Real " ( 2000 - pegged ) dollars are great for comparing growth rates across time .
It keeps things nice and even .
But describing the actual size of the American economy in 2000 terms makes little sense .
So , let 's hear it : three cheers for the American economy .

So if we grow at 4.8 % and China which is less than half of our economys size grows at 9 % ( which is completely unsustainable ) and considering that China has 1.5B people to our 300 M , how many hundreds of years will it be before the per capita GDP of China catches up with us ?
That is just to catch us .
It is growth in the economy that allows innovation and R&D spending , and consequently R&D spending that creates future growth .
By all metrics , the economies of old Europe are about as stagnant as can be .
We are growing despite the pressures of " outsourcing " and " China " and " offshoring " and all of the other Socialist scare rhetoric coming from the Democrats .
And their little babies like France and Germany are actually shrinking in both their role in the world and in their relative share of the world economy .

One of the newest web technologies has a sneaky power : it can access pages from your browser without you knowing about it
What if a computer geek could write a program that could make friends for him ?
That 's what 19 - year - old " Samy " did in October on the social networking site MySpace .
Samy , who started programming at 12 , was trying Ajax , the latest star of the Web 2.0 technologies .
It stands for Asynchronous Javascript and XML , and in effect lets your browser talk to websites without you knowing about it .
( There 's a primer at http://tinyurl.com/7xzse.)
Web users generally experience it as a smooth interaction that does n't have to load a new page - like dragging a mouse around the Google Maps interface .
Used on sites such as Odeo and Gmail , it allows them to be as interactive as desktop programs .
But Samy found a sneakier power in Ajax .
MySpace , the seventh most popular English - language website according to Alexa Internet , allows people to set up pages as part of a " profile " and find others through their profiles ; they can add those people as " friends " .
" The idea was simple .
I wanted anyone who viewed my profile to automatically add me as a friend , " says Samy .
" When I realised I could do this via Ajax , I figured I could replicate my Ajax code into any profile my code was modifying . "
After some tweaking to circumvent MySpace 's systems from preventing Javascript code running , Samy created Ajax code on his MySpace site that ran automatically when anyone looked at his profile .
Because Ajax can interact with pages users never see , his code pressed all the relevant buttons to add Samy to the victim 's friends , and added the words " but most of all , samy is my hero " to their page .
Finally , the code pasted itself into the victim 's profile , so that any MySpace user viewing the victim 's page would have their page infected .
MySpace users were unaware their computers were doing anything unusual .
Forced to shut down
The code - strictly speaking , a cross - site scripting worm - spread exponentially .
Within 24 hours Samy had a million emails from MySpace users " wanting " to be his friend and to whom he was their " hero " .
MySpace was forced to shut down and make changes to stop Samy 's code spreading .
The MySpace Worm , as it came to be called , served as an alarming example of what malicious hackers could do , even if they only had access to your browser .
" The potential , or threat , with Ajax malware is that server communication is now hidden from the user , " says Jesse James Garrett , who coined the term Ajax .
" As a result the application can do things on your behalf without your knowledge . "
On a web page , Ajax can do as much as Javascript - though that 's limited locally ( it ca n't delete files apart from cookies on your computer ) .
But it can do almost anything to a web page you have visible .
Garrett now consults for Adaptive Path , which has helped companies create their web experiences .
He often explains the popularity of Ajax as a way of making sites feel faster and more feature - rich , and allowing more of the computational work of web application to happen on the user 's computer .
However , if a site is n't secure , it means your browser can step through complex actions , with you none the wiser .
Billy Hoffman , a security researcher for SPI Dynamics in Atlanta , Georgia , had been pondering the risks of Ajax .
He outlined his worst - case scenario at the American security conference Black Hat Federal in January .
He called it the " 1929 Virus " , named for the stock market crash that preceded the Great Depression .
Hoffman envisioned such a " cross - site script " making its way into a forum post , user profile or web - based stock ticker .
Imagine someone who trades stocks online via a browser - as many Americans do - being hit by the virus .
The Ajax code could step through the complex forms required to transfer money between accounts and make trades .
It could selectively buy or sell stocks , without the knowledge of the account owner .
" The exploited users might get their money back but external investors would be making decisions based on a market that was influenced in part by a virus . "
Garrett says the early myth about Ajax - that it would be too complex for the average developer - has been dispelled , but sees its popularity with developers as a blessing and a curse .
Amazon has 25 books or articles on Ajax , the oldest from May last year .
An explosion of tools for creating Ajax has led to developers needing to know even less about the technology they are implementing .
The tools also lower the bar for malicious Ajax , prompting experts to implore developers to consider the security of web applications carefully .
Garrett sees the MySpace Worm as a proof of concept , and even Samy agrees .
Garrett thinks the developer community may only learn the lessons of website security through pain .
" There will be more damaging examples of Ajax malware before those holes get plugged . "
No general solution
He sees the buzz in the business community as part of the problem .
" Over-enthusiastic executives will demand that business logic move into the browser without thinking about the consequences . "
Hoffman points out there 's no way to create a general solution , even for websites that do n't use Ajax technology .
" A web server cannot tell the difference between requests made by a user with a browser and requests made by Ajax . "
Despite its promise , Web 2.0 is likely to have its share of security bumps .
But while many have learned not to open email attachments , user education may not be of much use in Web 2.0 because there 's no way of knowing the malicious code has been loaded - unless you turn off Javascript in your browser .
Then none of the Ajax - dependent sites such as Google Maps will work .
Hoffman does n't see any realistic defence for domestic users .
" They cannot protect themselves , they can only minimise risk ...
Do n't use the same username and password on every site . "

America watched tonight as the ten would - be -Presidents took the stage tonight in the first republican presidential debate .
When the dust settled it should have become clear to America , none of them care what Americans think .
This country is clearly now in favor of ending the Iraq disaster .
Seventy percent of the people in this country in fact have been consistently saying it needs to end now .
What did these aspiring leaders do in response tonight ?
They nearly all wanted to go to war with Iran .
The only sane voice on the stage ; the only true republican - conservative voice was Ron Paul .
Paul of course was barely given any face time , about four questions in an hour and a half by my count .
The media is still trying to shape who will run .
In 2004 they torpedoed the Howard Dean viability .
In 2007 they are already deciding who will make it .
Paul represents traditional conservative values of not policing the world and not having an out of control government .
He spoke passionately against a national ID card program , out of control spending , and bloated government in those brief opportunities he was afforded .
The other nine men however did not represent conservatism at all .
Instead it was 90 minutes devoted to casting platitudes toward Ronald Reagan and trying to sound like they wanted to blow up the world more than the next guy .
It was frightening to watch as at one point the response to the question about 70 % of Americans wanting an end to the Iraq debacle was essentially that they did not feel that was what America wanted .
Say what ?
The failure of Chris Matthews to follow up on the lunacy of that statement was stark .
Instead of speaking to the American people about what THEY want will be upheld by their elected leader , they launched into saber - rattling against Iran .
The message could not be clearer .
The republicans tonight , sans Paul , could care less what Americans actually want .
They used the typical right - wingnut talking points and lies about Iran .
Once again Paul was the only voice of reason when he pointed out that during the cold war we faced down a country with tens of thousands of nuclear weapons we were able to emerge victorious without the preemptive war policies of this faux republican administration but now we are talking about invading another country , in case there is a chance that a third - world country might be able to get their hands on one ?
On social issues it was obvious that Rudy Giuliani is going to have plenty of problems winning this primary .
His answers were all over the place , decrying abortion but not committing to restricting choice .
Perhaps what is more telling about where these people stand is not what was discussed but what was not .
Gay marriage was not even broached .
Education was not discussed .
The economy was not discussed .
This was an hour and a half about who was the tougher guy .
John McCain jumped off the deep end when he stated that he would “ follow Osama bin Laden to the gates of hell . ”
As he delivered that line he broke into a macabre smile that was very unsettling .
The fear fest was palpable as they all tried to deliver the consistent message that only they , the same republicans that were in power when we were attacked , are the only ones that can save us .
The same republicans , whose hands are stained with the blood of our soldiers over their complicity for the past five years , are the only ones who you should trust to now invade Iran .
Disgusting to his core Giuliani refreshed his ridiculous notion that if the democrats win , we would be “ on the defensive ” in the war on terror .
Shut up .
Blowing up Iraq and turning what was not a terrorist state into one , is not “ being on the offensive ” , it is patently stupid .
The hypocritical moment of the night though came when the question was asked about whether Scooter Libby should be pardoned .
The same republicans who bemoaned the “ rule of law ” when President Clinton lied under oath in a civil proceeding suddenly reversed themselves .
One candidate claimed prosecutorial misconduct for even interviewing Libby .
Another said that “ no crime was committed . ”
One said that Libby was convicted for having a “ poor memory . ”
Apparently they forgot what they stood for when Clinton faced impeachment .
The concept is simple .
The prosecutor was conducting an investigation into a federal crime of outing a covert CIA operative working to protect us from the proliferation of weapons of mass destruction .
We are talking about treason folks .
In the course of that investigation Scooter Libby LIED to the prosecutor while under oath .
Because of those lies , the investigation was damaged to the point that Fitzgerald ultimately could not charge anyone .
That is why it is illegal to LIE under oath .
The stench of hypocrisy was overwhelming from everyone but again , Ron Paul .
Paul correctly pointed out that the true issue is that Libby ’s lies protected people who used faulty intelligence to justify this failed war .
Kudos again to the only true conservative on stage .
The stupid question of the night was when Matthews asked them if it would be a good thing for Bill Clinton to be living in the White House ( assuming Hillary wins ) .
Beyond a softball , from the king of softball ; this question was designed so the candidates could spend 30 seconds each mocking the last president that the American people actually approved of , despite his moral failings .
Overall tonight was a stark reminder that the Republican Party has been hijacked .
They have often tried to float the lie that the democratic party has been overtaken by sinister forces on the left but this band of neo -con wannabes have bought into the failed philosophy of the past six years , wrap themselves up in a flag they did not actually fight for , and pretend to call it “ conservatism . ”
There is nothing conservative of about nation building .
There is nothing conservative about invading countries because you think they might one day , possibly acquire one weapon .
There is nothing conservative of about out of control spending and an economy that squeezes the middle class into the working poor .
No , these were not conservatives tonight on display .
These were people that drunk the kool - aid for far too long now .
They ignore the will of the American people , brazenly talk about more war , and ignore the true core issues for Americans such as healthcare , jobs , and education .
The only reference to healthcare was the tired , 15 - year old attack on Hillary Clinton ’s idea for national healthcare .
To these men it is better to turn a blind eye to the uninsured and call sane policy , socialism .
Now , in a major breakthrough , a group of researchers at the Weizmann Institute of Science in Israel , led by Roy Bar - Ziv , in collaboration with Margherita Morpurgo from the University of Padova in Italy , have designed a molecule affectionately called the “ daisy ” that is able to bind genes onto chips in miniature patterned arrays .
Bar - Ziv and co-workers have been able to use the daisy to pattern tiny regions of double - stranded DNA onto silicon dioxide surfaces .
Indeed , these immobilized genes are able to conduct their business on patterned silicon substrates without the need for living cells .
These biochips can act as protein microtraps , selectively trapping specific proteins from crude cell extracts with high spatial resolution .
Moreover , the gene sequences immobilized on the biochips can be used for the on-chip production of proteins by transcription / translation processes such as those occurring within cells .
Bar -Ziv and his colleagues have also demonstrated the integration of these systems with microfluidics .
Integration with flow systems is of interest for the fabrication of miniature assembly lines on chips , wherein proteins can be synthesized on the chips and transported to their final destinations through microfluidic channels .
In a remarkable demonstration of the utility of the daisy approach , the researchers have patterned two different genes as alternating stripes on a biochip .
The protein synthesized on one stripe diffuses to the second stripe where it regulates the synthesis of a second protein .
More complex artificial gene circuits can be envisioned by extending this protocol , and thus the biochips may be able to carry out complex cascaded information - processing functions , mimicking those in living organisms .
While computer modeling may be sufficient for political organisations such as the IPCC and Greenpeace to predict an apocalyptic future for the earth , for down - to - earth bio - researchers who absolutely must provide reliable results , computers are simply not good enough .
But bio-engineers , bio- physicists , and molecular biologists working with nanotechnologists are growing increasingly clever in designing useful models that do not use lab animals .
It will be many years before biomedical research no longer needs to sacrifice large numbers of lab animals for the saving of human life .
But it is encouraging to see the creation of " artificial cells " on silicon , and it is fascinating to contemplate the possibilities they offer .
Biological systems are too complex to be well - modeled by computers , currently .
Medical personnel are on the front lines , saving lives .
Society requires a far higher level of certainty of results from medical research than can be achieved by today 's computer models .
Most biological models make use of lab animals such as mice or rats .
But increasingly , acellular models are used .
A fascinating type of biochip that allows placing various cellular components on a silicon dioxide surface -- connecting them by microfluidic channels -- promises to provide increasingly ingenious acellular models for biomedical research .

This whole Foley business is one of the most dazzling political plays in my or any other lifetime - like watching an unassisted triple play or a running back tossing a 90 - yard touchdown pass on a double - reverse .
The Foley scandal is so perfectly tailored -- one could even say artistically designed -- to expose every character flaw of this country 's Republican leaders ( and their followers ) , and it has evolved so flawlessly ( like the most brilliantly coordinated symphony ) , that one is almost inclined to believe that it was divinely inspired .
It is difficult to believe that human beings ( let alone Democrats ) could create something so perfect ( as Billmon wrote in comments here the other day , the relentless efficiency of this scandal is proof positive that Democrats had nothing to do with it ) .
I agree with John Podhoretz 's description
The perfection of this scandal lies in its substance , not its theatrics .
The Foley scandal is not -- as even some Bush opponents have asserted -- an aberrational , isolated , inconsequential melodrama that is unrelated to the substantive and important critiques of the Bush movement and which just coincidentally emerged as a cynical weapon that can be used to defeat the Republicans .
The opposite is true .
This scandal has resonated so powerfully because it is shining such a powerful light on the towering hubris , utter lack of intellectual and ethical integrity , and deeply engrained corruption that accounts for virtually every other Bush disaster -- from Iraq to law - breaking scandals to torture to Abrahmoff - type corruption schemes and everything in between .
There are , as Matt Yglesias pointed out the other day , huge numbers of people in this country -- clearly the majority of the electorate -- who are not at all stupid but simply do not have the time or inclination to pay close attention to political events .
In that regard , people who spend substantial time in the blogosphere are aberrational ; it is not the norm to monitor political developments on a daily basis .
Most people rely upon journalists and pundits , as Yglesias said , " to let them know if something goes dramatically wrong with the governance of the country . "
But journalists have failed in that duty and the conservative pundits on whom many people ( particularly conservatives ) rely have purposely obscured what has been happening .
But for so many reasons -- its relative simplicity , its crystal clarity , the involvement of emotionally - charged issues , the salacious sex aspects -- this Foley scandal circumvents that whole dynamic .
People are paying attention on their own .
They do n't need pundits or journalists to tell them what to think about it because they are able to form deeply held opinions on their own .
None of the standard obfuscation tactics used for so long by Bush followers are working here .
To the contrary , their attempted use of those tactics is making things much worse for them , because people can see that Bush followers are attempting -- through the use of patently dishonest and corrupt tactics -- to excuse the inexcusable .
And seeing that , it gives great credence to all of the accusations voiced over the last five years that this is how the Bush movement operates in every area , because people can now see it for themselves .
In that regard , this scandal is like the Cliffs ' Notes version of a more complicated treatise on how the Bush movement operates .
Every one of their corrupt attributes is vividly on display here :
The absolute refusal ever to admit error .
The desperate clinging to power above all else .
The efforts to cloud what are clear matters of wrongdoing with irrelevant sideshows .
And the parade of dishonest and just plainly inane demonization efforts to hide and distract from their wrongdoing : hence , the pages are manipulative sex vixens ; a shadowy gay cabal is to blame ; the real criminals are those who exposed the conduct , not those who engaged in it ; liberals created the whole scandal ; George Soros funded the whole thing ; a Democratic Congressman did something wrong 23 years ago ; one of the pages IM'd with Foley as a " hoax " , and on and on .
There has been a virtual carousel -- as there always is -- of one pathetic , desperate attempt after the next to deflect blame and demonize those who are pointing out the wrongdoing .
This is what they always do , on every issue .
The difference here is that everyone can see it , and so nothing is working .
What Bush followers did yesterday really encapsulates what they are about .
They had Matt Drudge -- the same Matt Drudge who " broke the story " in the 2004 campaign of the intern who fled to Africa in order to escape John Kerry 's lecherous stalking -- post a screaming headline claiming that one of the pages claims that he only engaged in sex chats with Foley as a prank .
There are countless , obvious reasons why a page might claim that he only engaged in sex talk with a 53 - year - old man on the Internet as a prank ( much the way people caught with child pornography claim they have it only for research ) , but assume that it 's true that this particular page chatted with Foley for that reason .
It is painfully obvious that this proves nothing , that it does not help the House GOP leadership in any way or even remotely mitigate their conduct .
It has been clear from the first day that Foley has been engaged in a pattern of sexual pursuit of numerous Congressional pages over many years .
Some pages seemed to have welcomed the pursuit and encouraged it ; others found it highly objectionable ; and some may have been fueled by different motives .
But nobody doubts that Mark Foley has been systematically pursuing pages for sexual pleasure for years now .
That is not even in dispute .
And even if this one page were engaged in a " prank , " that would not change the nature of Foley 's behavior or impact the obligation of the GOP House leadership to act ( just as someone 's guilt is not mitigated when they try to hire someone they believe is a hit man but who is really a policeman pretending to be one ) .
Even if this one page out of all of the others were engaged in a " hoax , " it is still the case that Mark Foley was systematically pursuing Congressional pages while the GOP House leadership looked the other way .
The Drudge item ( even if true ) changes nothing .
It does not even arguably affect the scandal .
That is self - evident .
And , on top of all of that , the " report " came from the person who is probably the single least credible source on the Internet .
Despite all of that , Bush followers in every crevice immediately and mindlessly seized on this Drudge item and cited it virtually to proclaim the scandal over , suggesting -- based solely on this single item -- that the whole thing , the entire scandal , was a meaningless hoax from the beginning .
Even the Deputy Editor of The Wall St. Journal , Dan Henninger , repeated the " report " in arguing that the whole affair was a meaningless distraction : " By midafternoon yesterday , a rumor emerged that in fact Mark Foley had been pranked by the House pages .
" They all seized on a plainly false -- and , even if true , totally irrelevant -- " report " to declare that the whole scandal was nothing and was even the fault of those who talked about it .
Their only objective , as always , is to defend their Leaders , who can do no wrong , even when caught red-handed , and they will grab onto any claim , no matter how unreliable , false and / or irrelevant , to do so .
Beyond the deceit and desperation is the hypocrisy so glaring that it makes one 's eyes squint .
The examples are literally too numerous to chronicle , but one of my personal favorites is the feigned above - it - all , dismissive bewilderment that something as inconsequential and petty as a sex scandal could possibly be getting so much attention .
The Wall St. Journal 's Henninger yesterday asked : " Is this Mark Foley thing really happening ? "
Hennginger can't believe that with so many Important
Things going in the world , our country would really be focused on what he dismissively refers to as " Congressman Foley 's 1995 email traffic . "
Henninger is the Deputy Editor of the WSJ Editorial Page -- the same Editorial Page that spent much of the 1990s focusing on the spots on Bill Clinton 's penis , Hillary 's affair with Vince Foster , and semen stains on a blue dress .
The same people who impeached a popular , twice - elected President of the U.S. over a sex scandal involving consenting adults , who caused our country 's political dialogue for several years to be composed of the filthiest and most scurrilous speculation peddled by some of the lowest bottom - feeders and dirt - mongers , and who constructed a political movement based in large part on sermonizing about private sexual morality and demonizing those who deviate , are now protesting -- without any irony -- the fact that a sex scandal is distracting from the Truly Important Issues our country faces and that Mark Foley 's sexual pursuit over many years of 16 and 17 - year - old Congressional pages is nothing that really matters .
It is as though Republicans are being punished for all of their serious political sins at once , in one perfectly constructed , humiliating scandal designed to highlight their crimes and exact just retribution for them .
The Foley scandal is shining a very bright light on their conduct , not just in this one incident but with regard to how they have been governing the country generally over the last five years .
That is why this scandal is so important and it is why Bush followers are so desperate to proclaim the whole thing over with -- even if it means having to jump on a pathetic Matt Drudge item to do it .
The one thing they do n't want is for a clear , illuminating light to be shined on how they conduct themselves . :
The favorite " news " source for Bush followers , Matt Drudge , has been revealed , yet again , to be nothing more than a purveyor of fiction and lies .
The lawyer for the page who was the subject of Drudge 's report , Steven Jones ( the lawyer for Timothy McVeigh ) , denounced the Drudge item as " a piece of fiction " and said that " there is not any aspect of this matter that is a practical joke nor should anyone treat it that way " ( h/t TPM Muckraker ) .
Ironically , many Bush followers touted the fact that the page had hired such a credible and publicly known lawyer as proof that Drudge 's story was significant .
On a different note , The Buffalo News has a front - page article on the role which blogs have played in the Foley scandal , with a particular emphasis on how the work of blogs has affected their local Congressman , Tom Reynolds .
The article features the work of local blogs as well as this blog in ensuring that light was shined not just on Denny Hastert but also on some of the secondary though still culpable guilty figures in the scandal , such as Tom Reynolds .
世界一早 い 「ゲド戦記」インタビュー（完全版）
前口上
ヨミウリ・オンライ ン
依田謙一
昨年末、ヨミウリ・オンラインの「ジブリをいっぱい」で、鈴木敏夫プロデューサーのインタビューを掲載しました。今年７月公開のスタジオジブリの新作「ゲド戦記」（宮崎吾朗監督）について、スタジオ近くの「秘密の部屋」でじっくり語っていただいたものです。
ご本人からは事前に 「インターネットはスペースの心配をしなくていい媒体だから、語ったそのまま掲載してほしい」と言われていました。こちらもその考えに賛同し、映画化に至った経緯を詳しく伝えるため、できる限り省略せず、記事にしたつもりです。
しかし、掲載された記事に対し、鈴木プロデューサーから「これではダイジェストじゃないか」と電話がありました。
誤解を覚悟で言えば、世に存在するインタビューは、そのほとんどが「編集」されています。そもそも、人は物事を常に論理的に考えているわけではありませんし、会話というのはしばしば脇道に逸れるものです。質問も、前後の脈絡なく行われる場合があります。
こうして散らばった言葉は、テレビ、雑誌、新聞の媒体を問わず、“受け手のために”整理されます。今回のインタビューも、同じ目的で編集しました。一方、この作業には、送り手の思い込みが入りやすいという危険もあります。
今度は誤解なきよう説明すると、鈴木プロデューサーは普段、喋った内容についてああしてほしいこうしてほしいと言うことをほとんどしません。このあたりは、鈴木さんが尊敬し、同じような考えを持っていた堀田善衞さんの影響かも知れません（こうやって話は脇道に逸れます）。
その鈴木プロデューサーが電話口で、「いいですか、今回はとても慎重なんですよ」と言っていました。それは、駿監督と吾朗監督の親子関係を心配してのことのようでした。それを象徴するように、インタビュー中、言葉を選ぶため、しばしば考え込んでいたのを覚えています。
それから数週間後、 「ゲド戦記」の制作を担当するジブリの石井朋彦さんから「インタビューの完全版を掲載したい」という依頼がありました。
私がジブリを訪ねると、鈴木プロデューサーはこう言いました。
「 その作業は依田さん（＝私）にやってもらったら？ ペナルティーがあるんだから」
ペナルティーかどうかともかく、この誘惑は魅力的でした。実は私自身、日頃から「編集されないインタビュー」を読みたいと思っていた一人なのです。
インタビュー原稿ができ上がる過程で、喋った内容がすべて書き起こされている「ベタ起こし」というテキストが存在しますが、私は常々、実はこれが一番面白いんじゃないかと思っていました。
もちろん、このテキストは、原稿と呼ぶには未整理な部分もあります。話の順序もよく変わります。しかし、受け手がこうしたありのままの言葉を目にすることは滅多にありません。私はこの「実験」には意義があると思い、提案に乗ることにしました。それに、そもそも意義のないペナルティーは単なるいじめですから（また話が逸れました）。
それでは、長くなりましたが（そしてこの後も長いですが）お読み下さい。
何故、 「 ゲド戦記」だったのか
――こんな所に隠れ家があるんですね。
鈴木 あれ、来るの初めてでしたっけ？ まぁスタジオだとおおっぴらにできない話もありますからね、こういう場所があると助かるんです。
――しかも鈴木さんの後ろには、ドラえもんの座椅子が……。
鈴木 好きなんですよ、ドラえもん 。
――なかなか見られない絵ですよ。せっかくなので写真を撮ってもいいですか。
鈴木 いいけど、何に使うのよ 。
――後で考えます 。
鈴木 仕方ないなぁ（笑） 。
―― 「ゲド戦記」のインタビューは、今回が初めてですか。
鈴木 正確に言うと、この前、朝（日新聞）、毎（日新聞）、読（売新聞）、共同通信、それからスポーツ報知の記者を呼んで懇親会という形では語りました。なぜ今、「ゲド戦記」だったのか。監督はなぜ、吾朗君だったのか。そして親父（宮崎駿）はそれをどう思っているのか。
――今日お聞きしたいのはまさにその３つです（笑）。
鈴木 実は今か ら２０ 年以上前に一度、宮（崎駿）さんと「ゲド戦記」の映像化を企画したことがあったんです。「風の谷のナウシカ」（１９８４年）を作る前。
――そうなんですか 。
鈴木 確か６７年だったと思いますが、原作がアメリカで発表されて、数年後、日本で翻訳版が出たら、宮さんがはまりましてね。その影響で僕も読んだら、本当に面白かった。やがて「ナルニア国物語」「指輪物語」と合わせて３大ファンタジーと呼ばれるようになるでしょう。あの時いろんな人が３作品の映像化を実現しようとしていて、今思えば宮さんもその一人だったんですが、うまくいきませんでした。もしあの時、「ゲド戦記」をやっていたら、「ナウシカ」はなかったかも知れません。
――特にどの点に惹かれたのですか。
鈴木 力や魔法を手に入れて敵と戦うそれまでの冒険活劇やファンタジーと違い、戦う相手が「自分」であるということが衝撃的でしたね。これはル・グウィンさんの発明ですよ。だって、「ゲド戦記」がなければ、「スターウォーズ」シリーズもなかったわけでしょう。
宮崎駿監督は、どう思っているのか。
鈴木 その後、何度も繰り返し読んでいたんですが、数年前に読み返したら、特に第３巻が面白くてね。今の時代にぴったりだと思ったんです。それでええと……。ちょっと整理しますね（しばらく考え込む）。とにかくそんな経緯で、ずっと映像化したいと思っていたんです。そうしたら３年ほど前、日本語版を翻訳した清水真砂子さんを通じて、ル・グウィンさんがその後、宮崎作品をご覧になり、彼に映画化してほしいと言っているという話が舞い込んできた。僕としては渡りに船でしたが、宮さんは悩んでしまった。
――なぜですか 。
鈴木 何しろ 「 ハウルの動く城 」（２００４年）の制作で頭がいっぱいだったし、自分が作りたいと思っていた頃からずいぶん時間が経って、「今の自分にできるだろうか」という思いもあったようです。まぁ監督が吾朗君に決まるまでいろいろあるわけですが、それはとりあえず置いといてお話すると、ル・グウィンさんのもとに映像化の許諾をもらいに行くことになるのは、実は宮さんなんです。僕も一緒に行きましたけど。最初は、吾朗君が行くはずでしたが、それを聞いた宮さんが「おかしい」と言い出したんですよ。監督は時間があるなら一枚でも多く絵を描くべきで、原作者へ許諾をもらいに行くのはプロデューサーの仕事だろうと。そこでふと思いついて、「じゃあ宮さんと僕で行きましょう」と提案しました。宮さんは「えぇっ？」と動揺していましたけど、「ファンなんだからいいでしょう」と説き伏せました（笑）。
――会った際の様子はどうでした？
鈴木 今年（０５年）６月、「ハウル」の全米公開前に行ったんですが、ル・グウィンさんには宮さんが行くことを隠しておいたんです。それで、宮さんを「彼が宮崎吾朗です」と紹介したら、「ずいぶんお歳をめした方だったんですね」って（笑）。本人は部屋に入ってきた時から分かっていたと思いますが、そのことには一切触れずにいてくださったおかげで、和むことができました。
――交渉は順調でしたか。
鈴木 いろいろありましたよ。何しろ彼女は宮崎「駿」に映画化してほしいと言っていたわけですから。まず宮さんが「今日は俺に話をさせてくれ」と、「ゲド戦記」への思いを話し始めました。「本はいつも枕元に置いてある。片時も放したことがない。悩んだ時、困った時、何度読み返したことか。告白するが、自分の作ってきた作品は『ナウシカ』から『ハウル』に至るまですべて『ゲド戦記』の影響を受けている」と。そして「作品を細部まで理解しているし、映画化するなら世界に自分をおいて他に誰もいないだろう」と言い切った。しかしその直後、彼はこう付け加えました。「この話が２０年以上前にあったなら、自分はすぐにでも飛びついていたと思う。だが、自分はもう歳だ。そんな時、息子とそのスタッフがやりたいと言い出した。彼らが新しい魅力を引き出してくれるなら、それもいいかも知れない」。そしてこう締めくくった。「息子がやるであろうスクリプトには自分が全責任を持つ。読んで駄目だったら、すぐにやめさせる」と。
――ル・グウィンさんは？
鈴木 冷静でしたね。このあたりが日本人と米国人の違いというか、情に負けず、非常に理性的なんです。彼女は「二つ質問があります」と言いました。一つ目は「映画化されるのは第３巻が中心だと聞いていますが、登場するのはすでに年老いて中年になったゲドです。今のあなたにこそふさわしいのではありませんか」。二つ目は「あなたは吾朗さんが作るであろうスクリプトに対して全責任を持つと言いましたが、それはどういう意味ですか」。あ、三つ目もありました。「駄目だったらやめさせるとはどういうことですか。今日、あなたは映像化の許諾を取りに来たのではないのですか」。それを聞いた宮さんは僕の方を向き、「俺、何かまずいこと言ったかな」って（笑）。
――何と答えたのですか。
鈴木 僕は 「 全責任を持つというのは、つまりこの映画のプロデューサーをやるんですかって聞いているんです」と答えました。そうしたら宮さんはル・グウィンさんの前で突然、大きな声を出して、「冗談じゃない！
親子で一本の映画に名前を並べるなんてみっともないことはできない」って。率直な人なんです。
――話が紛糾してしまった。
鈴木 アメリカ人には意味不明ですよ（笑）。どうなるかと思っていたら、彼女の息子のテオさんが「 今夜は一緒に食事もしますし、大事な話は後でしませんか」とその場を取り直してくれました。実はテオさんは、交渉前に日本に来てくださり、僕や吾朗君といろんな話をしていたこともあって、味方になってくれたんです。これは僕の勝手な推測ですけど、偉大な親を持った者同士で相通じるところがあったのかも知れません。まぁそんなことがあって、ル・グウィンさんから「では景色でも見ていて下さい」と言われたんですが、今度は事前に送っておいた２枚の絵についての話になった。一つはポスターになっている吾朗君が描いた竜とアレンが向き合った絵。もう一つは宮さんが描いた第３巻のホートタウンの町の設定の絵なんですが、宮さんが突然、吾朗君の描いた絵を指して、「これは間違っていますよね」と言い出したんです。それで今度は自分の絵を指して、「これが正しいと思います」って。
――何しに行ったのか分からないじゃないですか（笑）。
鈴木 あんまり面白おかしく聞こえたら問題ですが、事実ですよ。そこから、なぜ間違っているかという説明が始まった。「このポスターのように、竜とアレンが目を合わせているのはおかしいじゃないですか。そうでしょう、ル・グウィンさん」と。
――決裂の危機ですね。
鈴木 何とかその場は別れましたけどね。それで夜の食事のとき、最初は関係ない話に終始していたんですが、途中で、テオさんがル・グウィンさんに「大切なお話があるんじゃないの」と促したんです。彼女はしばし沈黙した後、彼女の前に座っていた宮さんの手をとって「吾朗さんにすべてを預けます」と言いました。それを聞いた宮さんは、「うぅ…」と泣いていました。彼は激情家ですからね。冗談っぽく聞こえるかも知れませんが、本当の話です。それで、そろそろなぜ、吾朗君を監督に抜擢したかという話ですが……。
――お願いします 。
何故、宮崎吾朗を監督に抜擢したのか。
鈴木 前提として、ジブリの今後という問題があります。高畑勲は７０歳。宮崎駿も６５歳。２人合わせて１３５歳。これに僕の歳を足せば２００歳に近づいている（笑）。まぁそれはともかく、このままいけばジブリは終わりますよ。でも、もともと２人の映画が作りたくて始めた会社ですし、僕もある満足は得ている。心のどこかで「もうスタジオを閉じてもいいかな」と思っているところもありますが、やっぱりこれからを考えている若い人に対する責任もあります。だけど、宮さんは作る方は天才でも、教えるのは決してうまくない。先生としてはむしろ下手です。彼を助手席に乗せて運転すればすぐに分かりますよ。特にマニュアル時代は大変でした。「はいセカンド、はいサード、はいトップに入れて！」と横からいちいち口を出すから、大抵の人は運転がうまくできない。挙句の果てはノイローゼになってしまうんです。
――それは大変ですね（笑）。
鈴木 「 魔女の宅急便」（８９年）も「ハウル」も、最初は別の人が監督をやる予定だったのが、結局宮さんがやることになったように、映画作りでもそういう光景を何度か見てきました。もちろん宮さんに悪気はないんですよ。ただ、彼は一生懸命教えているつもりでも、受け取る側は、あまりに豊富な知識と経験を押し付けられるので、大変なんです。十二指腸潰瘍になって来なくなってしまう人もいたくらい（笑）。その点、「猫の恩返し」の森田（宏幸）君の場合は、いい意味で鈍感なのが良かった。何を言われても、「それは違うんじゃないですか」と平気で返せたからできた。黒澤（明）さんもそういうタイプだったみたいですからね。「椿三十郎」（６２年）だって堀川弘通さんがやるはずだったのが黒澤さんになってしまったようにね。それと、ジブリでは若い人が一度作ってもその後が難しいんです。
――というと ？
鈴木 うまく言いにくいんですが 、 「猫の恩返し」を例に取ると、試写が終わった直後、宮さんがすごく怒った顔で僕の部屋に入って来たんです。僕の部屋というのはいつもドアを開けっ放しにしていますが、その時は珍しくドアを閉じて、「あいつにどうして今時の若い娘の気分が分かるんだ」と腹を立てていました。褒めているんですよね。実は「ハウル」はその反動でもあって、ソフィーというのは、宮さんなりのハル（＝「猫の恩返し」の主人公）なんですよ。今の話と関係あるかどうか……でも、なかなか若い人に作るチャンスが巡って来ないのは確かです。宮さんも歳ですからね、時々極端なことも言うわけです。「俺はもう若い力は信じない。年寄りだけで作っていく！」とか。まぁそれもいいんですけど、僕としてはそういうわけにもいかないから、いろいろ考えるわけです。それで吾朗君を間に挟めばうまくいくんじゃないかと。
――でも、アニメーションの制作経験はないわけですよね。
鈴木 それは気になりませんでしたよ。彼がジブリ美術館を宮さんのイメージ図をもとに作った時だって、造園の経験はあっても建築はやったことなかったんですから。
――ジブリ美術館の時は、なぜ吾朗さんに白羽の矢を立てたのですか。
鈴木 中学生の頃から彼を知っていましたが、おじいさんの葬儀で久々に会った際、「吾朗です」と声を掛けられたのが妙に印象的だったんです。僕の目をしっかりと見て、視線を放さなかった。美術館の話が持ち上がった際、ふと顔が浮かんだんです。それで宮さんに吾朗君にやってもらうのはどうかと話したら、「鈴木さんが説得して、本人がやるというなら仕方ない」ということになって。
――吾朗さんの答えは。
鈴木 二つ返事で了承してくれました。それでいざ仕事してもらったら、ありがたいと思ったことが二つあった。一つは、ジブリ美術館を完成させた上で、運営まで見事にやってのけてくれたこと。もう一つは、宮さんの描くイメージで曖昧な部分があると、断固として受け付けなかった。これは非常に頼もしく思えた。宮さんは美術館を作る際も、ありとあらゆることに口を出しましたが、頭の中にあるものは空想の産物の場合もある。それに対して、吾朗君は「駄目なものは駄目」と明快だった。そういう自分の考えを実行に移す彼のパワーを見ているうちに、もしかしたら映画の仕事もできるんじゃないかと思ったんです。それで「ゲド戦記」の話があった際、「ジブリ美術館のこれからを考えるなら、ジブリのこれからに無関心ではいられないだろう。企画に参加してみないか」と聞いたら、すぐに「美術館と関係があるので」と答えた。それで去年の秋（０３年１０月）、企画を立ち上げるため、あるアニメーターと僕、それに吾朗君と石井（朋彦）という若い制作スタッフでこの部屋に集まりました。
――その時点ではまだ「監督」ではなかったんですね。
鈴木 そうです。それで話を進めていくうち、僕としては監督をやってもらいたいと思い始めていましたが、そのためにはいろんな人に話をしなきゃならない。そこで、ある程度企画が見えたところで、宮さんに「本格的に準備するにあたり、吾朗君にアドバイザーとして関わってもらいたい」と話したんですが、大反対でしたね。「吾朗は関係ないだろう」って。スタジオの皆に話した際も、彼が参加することに様々な意見がありました。そのうちに誰が絵を描くのかということになったので、右往左往しながら、まずは絵コンテを描いてもらうことにしたんです。
――どう描き始めたのですか。
鈴木 最初に注文したのは、見よう見まねでやりなさいということ。親父が描いた絵コンテをそばに置いて、自分がほしいカットがあったら、それを参考にしろと。そして、その作業は人前で堂々とやりなさいと言いました。また、彼自身もいろいろ考えて、ジブリ美術館でやった「ピクサー展」で得た知識をもとに、カードに絵を描き、それを縮小コピーして張り付けるという方法を編み出した。やがて内容が固まってきたところで、ル・グウィンさんの元へ許諾をもらいに行くことになったので、僕から「竜とアレンが向き合っている絵を描いてくれ」と依頼しました。それから「横から見たんじゃなく縦から見た構図にしてくれ」と付け加えました。なぜか。親父が描かないアングルだからです。この絵ができた時、僕は吾朗君が監督としていけると確信しました。それで、宮さんにちゃんと話さなければと会いに行ったら「鈴木さんはどうかしている」と怒り出した。「あいつに監督ができるわけがないだろう。絵だって描けるはずがないし、もっと言えば、何も分かっていないやつなんだ」と。そこで僕が吾朗君の描いた絵を見せたら黙ってしまった。一枚の絵ってそういう力があるんですね。そこで、僕からはっきり言いました。「進めますよ」。本人はしばらく呆然としたままでしたけどね。
――吾朗さんが描けるということは以前から知っていたのですか。
鈴木 僕はね、きちんと観察さえできれば絵は誰でも描けると思っています。これは「月刊アニメージュ」という雑誌をやっていた時のことですが、普段絵を描かない編集部員に、編集後記用の自画像を描いてもらったことがあったんです。皆、最初は無理だと言っていましたが、自分の顔を丁寧に観察し始めたら、ちゃんと最後まで描けた。しかも、一生懸命描いた迫力があった。吾朗君も、打ち合わせの最中に似顔絵を描いていたので、観察ができる彼ならできると思っていました。実際、彼は描けましたし、この２年間に長足の進歩を遂げました。
――完成した絵コンテを見た感想は。
鈴木 これは僕よりも他の 言葉で紹介した方がいいと思います。名アニメーターの大塚康生さんは（とシワシワ声でモノマネを始まる）、「いひゃぁー鈴木さんびっくりしましたよぉ。すごいですねぇ。映画として素晴らしいし、つなぎ方も完璧でしたぁ」と絶賛した上で、「ところで誰が描いたんですか」と聞いてくるので、「吾朗君ですよ」と答えたら、「いや、そうじゃなくて、吾朗君が指示して描いたのは誰ですか」とさらに聞くので、「いゃ、だから吾朗君です」と答えたら、「ふぇっ！
蛙の子は蛙だったんだ。びっくりしたなぁ。小さい頃から知ってるけど、へぇ」と心底、驚いていました。また、庵野（秀明）に見せたら、「これは完全に宮崎アニメですね」と舌を巻き、「吾朗君はいくつですか」と聞いてくるので、「３８歳だよ」と答えたら、「どうしてもっと早くやらせなかったんだ」と言っていました。
――駿監督は絵コンテを見たのですか。
鈴木 見ていません。今も混沌とした状態で、二人はまったく口をきいていません。つい最近まで宮さんが美術館用の短編を同じフロアで作っていたのですが、お互いの声が聞こえても決して接点を持とうとしなかった。部屋の中ですれ違いそうになるとすっとお互いを避けて踵を返していたほどですから。
――吾朗さんはアニメーションへの関心がずっとあったのですか。
鈴木 僕には分かりません。普通は自分の親父の近くで仕事をするのは嫌なはずですが、どこかで父親の仕事への関心というものはあったのかも知れません。理由は分かりませんが、彼がジブリ美術館の仕事を引き受けた時、それを感じました。今、彼は自らジブリのホームページで日々の思いを綴っていますから、そこで明かされていくかも知れません。
――吾朗さんの演出の特徴は。
鈴木 彼はアニメーターの絵を見て違うなと思う部分があると、実際に自分で演技して見せるんです。実に明快な方法で、アニメーターはそれを見て描けばいい。これだけイメージがはっきりしている監督はなかなかいません。
――駿監督もそういう演出をされますよね。
鈴木 確かに。そういう意味では似ているかも知れません。
――ところで、宣伝戦略はどうするつもりですか。
鈴木 新人監督ですから、しっかりやりますよ。 「 ハウル」のような「宣伝をしない、宣伝」ができるのは宮崎駿だからです。それに彼の名前を宣伝に使おうとは思っていません。
――駿監督のクレジットはどうするつもりですか。
鈴木 悩んでいます。苦し紛れに珍案奇案も考えました。 「 父 宮崎駿」とか（笑）。だって「アドバイザー」とかもっともらしいこと言っても仕方ないでしょう。あえてもう一つ候補があるとすれば「ゴッドファーザー 宮崎駿 」 。
「 ゲド戦記」で描きたいこと 。
――最後に、鈴木さんが今、この時代に「ゲド戦記」を送り出そうと思ったきっかけを教えて下さい。
鈴木 一言で言えば、希薄になってしまっ た 「現実感」を描けるような気がしたからです。
――「現実感 」 ？
鈴木 日本人全体が陥っているかも知れないことですが、当事者意識の欠如ということです。この前の選挙で、郵政民営化を賛成か反対かを一人一人の国民に問いましたが、果たしてそんな必要があったのか。それは、会社がつぶれそうかという時に、社員に「どうしましょうか」と聞くことでしょう。同じように、憲法改正や増税についても賛成が増えている状況も疑問です。僕はそれを見て、皆、庶民でなくなってきているなと感じます。この国を何とかするためにそれをやるという発想は、庶民じゃなくて為政者でしょう。国がやることにたて突くのが庶民じゃなかったんですか。増税して改憲して、それが何につながるか。「欲しがりません勝つまでは」ですよ。だから皆に目を覚まして欲しいし、小泉内閣の虚像をはがして欲しい。増税になって一番困るのは誰か分からない状態が、僕の考える当事者意識の欠如ということです。吾朗君は「人としてまっとうに生きること」をテーマにしていますが、それも当事者意識ということとつながってくる。まぁこれは作品を通して彼が表現していくことなので、このくらいにしておきますが。
――そう言わずに、もう一声お願いします。
鈴木 皆がそんなに立派にならなきゃいけないんでしょうかということです。別の例で言えば、携帯電話がどんどん高機能になっているでしょう。僕は見ていて怖い。ＳｕｉｃａもＥｄｙも使ってみましたが、携帯電話がお財布になったり、メールができたり、電車に乗れたりということは、確かに便利かも知れない。でも、人間って基本的にだらしないでしょう。それが、何もかも一つになって、なくすことができないものを持てということは、少なくとも僕は受け入れたくない。要するにだらしないことをするなと求められているんですよ。そういう便利さという名の「立派」のために切り捨てられていくものがあるんじゃないですか。関係ない話かも知れませんが、今、商法の改正で四半期ごとに決算を報告しなきゃいけないんです。なぜかといえば、二度と大量の不良債権を生まないという目的があるから。日本の経営者たちは決算書もまともに読めないからあんなことになったんだと。しかし、そういうことをきちんとしている人に面白い経営ができますか。計算ができないから無茶をするのであって、無茶をするから面白いんです。
――ええ 。
鈴木 宮さんだってそうですよ。話は逸れましたが、魔法が使えるはずだった世界で、魔法が使えなくなり、大きな町へ行けば、人々は右往左往しているばかり。流行っているものといえば、人身売買と麻薬。そういう状況で少年と魔法使いが出会う。さぁどうなるか――。ハイ、もう十分喋ったよね（笑）。

When I try to imagine an ideal government , it looks a lot like the government of Taiwan .
First , they ’re democratic .
That ’s a good start .
But the best part is that they have Jerry Springer - like fights in parliament on a regular basis .
In today ’s news , yet another brawl broke out in the Taiwanese parliament .
This time it was over a budget bill .
http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/18548294/?GT1=9951
Seriously , how cool is that ?
Apparently this sort of thing happens all the time in Taiwan .
A legislator objects to a parliamentary procedure and the next thing you know , the Minister of Shellfish is bitch - slapping him .
A moment later , the air is filled with shoes , lunchboxes , and microphones .
Can you imagine CSPAN ’s ratings if we followed that model in America ?
I do n’t think you ’d be able to pry yourself away from the TV long enough to take a dump .
You ’d just sit there all day long with an adult diaper waiting for someone to sucker punch Teddy Kennedy .
Pause to consider how much you would pay to see Nancy Pelosi kick Dick Cheney in the nuts on national television .
I ’ll bet it ’s a big number .
Imagine that after she delivers the kick , Trent Lott flings a wing tipped shoe at the back of her head and knocks her off the dais .
Now how much would you pay ?
Personally , I ’m in triple digits already and the imaginary brawl has barely started .
Can it get any better ?
Yes , it can .
Imagine that voters start preferring candidates who have kung fu skills .
It makes sense , because if you are from Rhode Island , for example , you do n’t want to watch your tiny congressman get his ass kicked over a highway bill .
So you ’d vote for a candidate who can take a punch and still hand out some pain .
Now imagine it ’s the State of the Union Address and everyone but the secretary of dryer lint is in attendance .
All hell breaks loose .
There ’s punching and kicking and kung fu levitating .
Tell me you would n’t be interested in politics then .
I think we ’d all agree that democracy is a better form of government than a dictatorship .
But democracy plus punching is the best government of all .

Joseph Cooney had a brilliant idea for a new application certification program .
But Vista 's bland white - on - gray badge , in my opinion , does n't properly communicate the .. authoritative .. nature of said program .
With the help of Jon Galloway , we zazzed things up a bit :
You might think attaining such a prestigious , rigorous level of certification would be far too challenging .
But fear not !
Participating in this innovative new application certification program is as simple as pressing the F5 key on your keyboard .
Just follow the four easy steps Joseph outlined :
Compile your application code .
Getting the latest version of any recent code changes from other developers is purely optional and not a requirement for certification .
Launch the application or website that has just been compiled .
Cause one code path in the code you 're checking in to be executed .
The preferred way to do this is with ad - hoc manual testing of the simplest possible case for the feature in question .
Omit this step if the code change was less than five lines , or if , in the developer 's professional opinion , the code change could not possibly result in an error .
Check the code changes into your version control system .
Congratulations !
You 're fully certified .
Brand your app with your shiny new Works on My Machine badge .
You 'll certainly want to show it off to your fellow team members and key stakeholders .
But please -- do try to keep your ego in check .
Not everyone is capable of such an epic commitment to quality in software engineering .
( update : love the WOMM certification so much you want to proudly wear your certification for all to see ?

A new study led by a UC Irvine economist debunks a popular argument against urban sprawl -- that living farther from neighbors decreases social interaction .
In fact , the data shows that suburban living is better for one 's social life .
Using data from 15,000 Americans living in various places across the country , researchers found that residents of sprawling suburban spaces actually have more friends , more contact with neighbors and greater involvement in community organizations than citydwellers who live in very close proximity to each other .
" Our findings suggest the old proverb may be true : good fences make good neighbors , " said Jan Brueckner , professor of economics at UCI and lead author of the paper .
" This contradicts one of the common social and economic arguments against urban sprawl . "
Among their specific findings were that for every 10 - percent decrease in density , the likelihood of residents talking to their neighbors at least once a week jumps by 10 percent .
And involvement in hobby - oriented clubs increases even more significantly -- by 15 percent for every 10 percent decline in density .
To measure these and other social interactions , researchers used data from the Social Capital Benchmark Survey and controlled for other factors such as income , education and marital status .
Opponents of urban sprawl -- most famously " Bowling Alone " author Robert Putnam -- have argued that America 's spreading development is detrimental to society , causing increased traffic congestion , loss of valuable open space and a decline in social relationships .
To combat these perceived problems , some cities like Portland , Ore. , have enacted urban growth boundaries to limit sprawl .
Brueckner says it 's important to understand the true impact of urban sprawl on traffic , open space and social relationships , because these all affect the economy .
" Strong social networks do more than just keep people happy and engaged , " said Brueckner .
" The more friends you have and the more involved you are in your community , then the better are your labor market outcomes -- shorter unemployment spells , better job matches -- as a result of job referrals . "
While the researchers say it 's still unclear exactly why denser city living decreases social interaction , Brueckner says people may be more willing to engage in activities like clubs , civic organizations and community events when they do n't feel forced upon one another .
Another factor limiting social interaction in cities may be fear of crime , which discourages people from getting to know each other .

GRETA GILBERTSON was caught off guard recently when her 9 - year - old daughter , who attends a private school on the Upper West Side , requested a cellphone .
" I sort of snapped at her , " recalled Ms. Gilbertson , an assistant professor at Fordham University in the Bronx .
" I said , ' Do n't think that you 're one of the rich kids , because you 're not . ' "
Though her daughter rarely expresses envy of her more affluent friends , Ms. Gilbertson said , it was an " unedited moment " revealing her anxiety over being in a world where other parents have more money than she does .
Carol Paik , a former lawyer who is married to a partner at a prominent New York law firm , found herself on the other side of that money equation .
When she returned to school in 2002 to get her M.F.A. in creative writing at Columbia , her diamond engagement ring attracted particular attention from her new group of friends .
" When I was working , " she said , " I never thought about the ring , it seemed unremarkable . "
But at school , she said , " People said things like , ' That 's a really big diamond , ' and not necessarily in a complimentary way . "
So she began taking off the ring before class .

Update : Andrew Welch found out that he had been referring not to the genuine AI Escargot puzzle :
While this is considered to be a harder puzzle for humans , both our XSLT solvers had less trouble and took less time ( Andrew ’s did decrease dramatically ) on the new AI Escargot .
Times for solving the " genuine AI Escargot " :
DN : 1.302 seconds AW : 1.760 seconds
If you , like me , have missed last November ’s story of a a Finnish mathematician claiming to create the most difficult Sudoku - puzzle known so far , you ’d probably try to check whether such a claim was likely to be true .
Both I and Andrew Welch are big fans of XSLT programming , putting it to use for solving seemingly strange kinds of problems , Sudoku - puzzles included .
For a long time we have been rivals each trying to outperform the solution of the other .
Thus both of us managed to speed up our initial creations literally hundreds of times .
At the end we achieved a state of a tie - in , in which each solution was shown to outperform the other for certain classes of Sudoku- puzzles and to lag behind significantly in other cases .
My own explanation has been that Andrew ’s solution is much faster for simple Sudoku- puzzles ( usually taking only a fraction of a second ) , while needing potentially tens of seconds for more complicated Sudoku- puzzles , on which my solution needed not more than two seconds .
Of course , I cannot seriously claim this statement is correct , because no one can define what a " simple " and " complex " Sudoku - puzzle is .
Anyway , when yesterday Andrew sent me the link to the
AI Escargot ,
the first thing I did was to run my XSLT 2.0 solution and measure the time :
It took 1.432 seconds on a 3MHz , 2GB RAM Pentium IV desktop using Saxon 8.9.2J .
In the meantime Andrew reported on his blog that his solution took about 24 seconds — probably on a less powerful computer , as on mine it runs for 17.172 seconds .
I have an idea how to combine our two solutions into one that will have most of the strengths and almost none of the shortcomings of each of the two separate ones — this is a topic of a future article .
Lightning
PBS air date : October 18 , 2005
ROBERT KRULWICH :
By the way , maybe you 've noticed , in the old movies , when it 's time to zap the monster on the table and bring it to life , they always use lightning .
I mean always .
And why ?
Well , because lightning is electrical .
It turns things on .
Though exactly what lightning does is left to your imagination , because , in the end , what makes life , that 's still a mystery .
But interestingly — and I did n't know this — it turns out that what makes lightning is also still a mystery .
In fact , it 's kind of a big mystery .
Here 's correspondent Chad Cohen
CHAD COHEN ( Correspondent ) :
It 's an elemental force of nature and still one of the most mysterious .
JOSEPH DWYER ( Florida Institute of Technology ) : Lightning is very difficult to study , and I think we probably understand better how a star explodes halfway across the galaxy than how lightning propagates from six miles up .
CHAD COHEN : Lightning strikes the Earth 4,000,000 times a day .
And after hundreds of years of scientific scrutiny , we still do not understand the essential secret of how it begins inside a storm .
That 's why Professors Ken Eack and Richard Sonnenfeld and their team from New Mexico Tech are on a 10,000 - foot mountain , waiting for lightning to strike .
KENNETH EACK ( New Mexico Institute of Mining and Technology ) :
We 're trying to find out something new about thunderstorms and lightning .
That discovery I think is , is worth the risk .
CHAD COHEN : Whatever causes lightning to start has always been hidden inside the clouds , so unlocking that process requires waiting for the weather to reach maximum force , then launching sensitive instruments into the heart of the storm .
It 's hazardous and frustrating .
RICHARD SONNENFELD : Come on out .
Let 's go .
Go , go , keep going .
Hey , do n't drop it .
Do n't drop it .
Okay , let 's go , let 's go .
Go ahead , you get in position , you get in position .
Oh !
Let 's go in , in , in .
It hit the ground .
DR . MARTIN UMAN ( University of Florida ) : A thunderstorm has got the energy of an atomic bomb .
CHAD COHEN : Dr. Martin Uman is the director of the International Center for Lightning Testing and Research in Camp Blanding , Florida .
MARTIN UMAN : It 's the brightest light that we see ; it 's the loudest noise that we hear .
The only thing hotter than lightning on Earth would be a nuclear weapon explosion .
CHAD COHEN : But what triggers the release of all that power ?
We know that lightning is a huge electric spark , and sparks happen when positive and negative charges build up so much energy they leap through the air to get at each other .
It can only happen when the negative charge in that ball on the right and the positive charge in that metal rod on the left get so overwhelmingly strong , they cut a path through the air in the middle .
DR . MARTIN UMAN : It 's like a hose full of pressure and it can't hold on anymore .
CHAD COHEN : That 's what most scientists thought was happening inside thunderstorms , as ice and water particles collide with each other , moving electric charges to opposite ends of a cloud .
When the charge above and the charge below get strong enough , they leap through the air as a bolt of lightning .
Except for one thing , when you actually examine the storm cloud , the strength of the positive and negative charges and the electric field around them is n't nearly enough to create that big spark .
JOSEPH DWYER : Well , the problem is , after decades and decades of measurements up in thunderstorms , nobody has ever managed to find an electric field anywhere near that big .
CHAD COHEN : Dr. Joe Dwyer is a professor at Florida Tech .
JOSEPH DWYER : Well , maybe we 're looking for something that does n't exist .
Maybe there 's something wrong with our understanding about how electrical discharges get started in places like thunderstorms .
CHAD COHEN : So if thunderclouds , even great big thunderclouds , do n't have electric fields big enough to generate the giant spark that lightning actually is , where 's all that energy coming from ?
Well , here in Florida they have a pretty dramatic way of trying to figure that out .
They launch rockets with really long wires attached to try to create that express lane to ground that lightning likes so much .
To get lightning from these clouds to strike where scientists can measure it requires a simple trigger .
MARTIN UMAN : First of all , you need to have a propellant that can get this thing up there in a hurry .
It has to be able to go 700 yards or so in about two seconds .
CHAD COHEN : What is this , actually ?
This is ... is it just copper wire ?
MARTIN UMAN : It 's Kevlar® - covered copper wire .
CHAD COHEN : Kevlar , okay .
MARTIN UMAN : So , we load it , connect it electrically .
When we 're about to fire , switches are turned on here , manually .
After that , everything is done with air pressure from downstairs .
JASON JERAULD : Okay , Casey , Tube 2 is armed .
Three , two , one , fire !
CHAD COHEN : From 2,000 feet up , the wire triggers lightning with a path to ground higher than the Empire State building .
And when it strikes , over a hundred million volts zap the array of test equipment on the ground .
CASEY RODRIGUEZ : Okay , Tube 4 is good .
Go ahead and fire 11 when ready .
JASON JERAULD : Tube 11 is armed .
Three , two , one , fire !
CHAD COHEN :
The rockets are , for the first time , allowing physicists to experiment with lightning under repeatable and controllable conditions , so that now Joe Dwyer and other researchers can test an alternate theory of how lightning starts .
That theory is called " Runaway Breakdown . "
Using this model , the energy field inside the storm cloud , that force between positive and negative , too weak to form a bolt of lightning , is struck by outside particles , bursts of electrons , which carry their own energy , very high energy .
And with that added energy , you can now get that big spark .
JOSEPH DWYER :
You end up with an avalanche of electrons moving near the speed of light .
Now this model will work , as long as you have one fast electron to start it off , sort of the first ... the finger that pushes the first domino to get the whole thing started .
CHAD COHEN : And here 's where things get really interesting .
Joe Dwyer and many other scientists believe that this outside energy force comes , not from the clouds , or anywhere else on Earth for that matter , but from cosmic rays : tiny , subatomic particles ejected from dying stars millions of years ago and billions of miles away .
But how do you test this theory ?
JOSEPH DWYER :
We have 10 of these detectors spread out over the facility right now .
CHAD COHEN : Well , it turns out , when cosmic particles hit the Earth 's atmosphere , they leave a unique signature in the form of gamma and x-rays .
If scientists can detect these x-rays , they 'll have the proof they need .
JOSEPH DWYER :
This is what 's called a sodium iodide detector .
There 's a piece of crystal in here that will absorb x-rays and gamma rays , and these things are not difficult to measure .
CHAD COHEN : That 's where triggered lightning comes in .
For the first time , the Florida Research Center 's rockets allow Dwyer to place his x-ray detectors in lightning 's path .
He made his first series of measurements in 2002 .
JOSEPH DWYER : A big negative voltage pulse would mean that we got a burst of x-rays in the detector .
I actually did n't think we were going to see x-rays .
The first plot we brought up , there was a nice little pulse that looked just like an x-ray right at the time that the lightning occurred .
" Now , that 's , that 's interesting ; that 's probably a coincidence , you know ?
What 's the chance of that ? "
So , we looked at the next lightning stroke — and there was an even bigger pulse — and the next one and the next one .
And every one had these pulses that looked exactly like x-rays .
I think I just about fell out of my chair at that point .
CHAD COHEN : Every single lightning strike Dwyer measured showed the presence of x-rays .
But ground measurements can't reach high enough to where lightning actually starts .
For that , you need to get instruments right up into the heart of the storm .
KENNETH EACK :
We finally have the technology to build these instruments that are small enough and rugged enough to handle a thunderstorm environment .
CHAD COHEN : Lightning is striking all around them .
It 's time to launch .
KENNETH EACK : One event wo n't be enough .
If we see an x-ray burst , and we call it quits on one event , well , that 's , that 's not good enough .
And it 's just going to take a lot of measurements to get in the right spot at the right time .
RICHARD SONNENFELD :
Three , two , one ... go!
CHAD COHEN :
The balloon is sucked into the storm , trailing its cargo of instruments .
Launches like these have finally traced x-rays all the way up to where lightning begins and have given scientists the strongest evidence yet that lightning 's spark comes from forces outside the Earth itself .
JOSEPH DWYER :
These cosmic rays may be the link which will connect a dying star halfway across the galaxy with lightning .
ROBERT KRULWICH : Thank you Chad Cohen .
And now for our regular segment , " Do n't Ask the Expert . "
Astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson said , " Whatever you do , please do not ask me about Hollywood space aliens . "
But we did .
NEIL deGRASSE TYSON : Hollywood ?
Do n't get me started .
Every time they put out an alien , it 's for all intents and purposes identically human .
If you were a jellyfish and saw the Hollywood aliens , you 'd say they looked exactly like human beings .
Two arms , two legs , a head , a neck , maybe they 'll give it three eyes , instead of two , or antennae .
They always have a face which is a very vertebrate kind of thing to have .
So many other life forms on our planet , with whom we have DNA in common , do not have faces .
Trees do n't have faces ; worms do n't have faces ; jellyfish do n't have faces .
The list is long .
You could draw from our own planet , finding creatures that look so unlike us that you 'll do better tapping them as alien life forms than anything Hollywood comes up with in all of their movies .
And I 'm very disappointed .
You know what the best Hollywood alien movie has been in my list ?
The Blob , the old Steve McQueen movie from the ' 50s , The Blob .
That did n't have a face , did it ?
It was just this creature .
And you did n't know what made it work , but it loved your blood .
Even though it was a B - movie they did well
Robert Scoble ’s whine that all these horrible bloggers are cuddling up to Google whilst ignoring poor old Microsoft has to be the ultimate irony , does n’t it ?
Having worked as a tech journalist for many years I ’ve heard a million times , competitors to Microsoft incessantly bitching about how the press only ever covers Microsoft products while ignoring their alternatives .
Kinda sucks when the shoe is on the other foot , hey ?
That simple reversal would be ironic enough were it not for the fact that Microsoft very deliberatly and expertly dined out on this marketing advantage that it enjoyed .
We used to call it the FUD factor , FUD referring to Fear , Uncertainty and Doubt .
Back when it was the only game in town , Microsoft was famous for pre-announcing products .
As soon as someone at Microsoft got back to the office with a new product idea scrawled on the back of a napkin , Microsoft would announce it .
Often , not only did it used to talk about the coming release , but also the one after that .
The reason for doing this is that if Microsoft was talking about a feature or capability that it was working on , it worked as a disuader to purchase rival software .
So yes , maybe NetWare could do this and this and this , but why would you buy it when Microsoft says that its next version of NT will do exactly the same thing .
Of course , Microsoft was infamous for missing its ship dates but that hardly mattered , because it had thrown enough FUD into the air to stop people from genuinely considering alternatives .
The problem for Microsoft is not only is it ’s no longer the only choice on the block .
It ’s no longer the one that has the media entranced .
That ’s clearly Google .
The fact is people ca n’t get enough of Google so journalists and bloggers will continue to write about them because it rates .
It ’s just how media works .
Yet , Microsoft has n’t updated its marketing strategy , to fit with its new place in the world .
Let ’s take the Office Live announcement that Scoble is talking about .
Microsoft announces Office Live with absolutely nothing behind it , except a landing page and a couple of snippets like the Domain Management capability .
It promises that it will be able to do this and that when Office Live launches sometime next year .
It made headlines for a day or so , but because there was very little substance to what it had to say , few journalists or bloggers got enraptured with what it had to say .
Microsoft does n’t have FUD power anymore .
Pre -announcing products without even opening up to beta these days only achieves SAD – scepticism , ambivalence and disinterest .
By pre-announcing Office Live , though , it did achieve one thing .
It publicised its roadmap to Google and every other competitor in this space .
It handed Google over what should be top - secret , classified intelligence about what it ’s going to announce and approximately when .
The Google marketing team would have then had the opportunity to go away and draw up a counter - marketing strategy to effectively blunt anything Microsoft is likely to come up with when Office Live does launch .
I have no doubt that this latest announcement from Google is absolutely a part of that Office Live counter - strategy .
The difference being when Google chose to talk about it , it had something real , even if its just a closed beta program and a single reference customer .
The blog bleating of Robert Scoble and also Reeves here would have had Google ’s marketing team giving high - fives all round .
They amount to nothing more than an admission that Google is out - marketing Microsoft , as well as further re-inforcement of the fact that Microsoft is just not sexy anymore .
Microsoft , your FUD days are over .
It ’s time to tear up your marketing manuals and start again from scratch .
We ’ve all moved on , it ’s about time you guys did as well .

t was breakfast time , and the food stand in the village in northeastern Thailand was crowded .
Maesubin Sisoipha , the middle - aged woman cooking the food , was friendly , her portions large and the price right .
For the equivalent of about 5 cents , she offered a huge green mango leaf filled with rice , fish paste and fried beetles .
It was a hearty breakfast , if one did n't mind the odd antenna left sticking in one 's teeth .
One of the half - dozen men and women sitting on a bench eating was a sinewy , bare - chested laborer in his late 30's named Mongkol Latlakorn .
It was a hot , lazy day , and so we started chatting idly about the food and , eventually , our families .
Mongkol mentioned that his daughter , Darin , was 15 , and his voice softened as he spoke of her .
She was beautiful and smart , and her father 's hopes rested on her .
" Is she in school ? " we asked .
" Oh , no , " Mongkol said , his eyes sparkling with amusement .
" She 's working in a factory in Bangkok .
She 's making clothing for export to America . "
He explained that she was paid $ 2 a day for a nine - hour shift , six days a week .
Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn , who received a Pulitzer Prize for their coverage of China , are the authors of " Thunder From the East : Portrait of a Rising Asia " ( Knopf ) , from which this article is adapted .
" It 's dangerous work , " Mongkol added .
" Twice the needles went right through her hands .
But the managers bandaged up her hands , and both times she got better again and went back to work . "
" How terrible , " we murmured sympathetically .
Mongkol looked up , puzzled .
" It 's good pay , " he said .
" I hope she can keep that job .
There 's all this talk about factories closing now , and she said there are rumors that her factory might close .
I hope that does n't happen .
I do n't know what she would do then . "
He was not , of course , indifferent to his daughter 's suffering ; he simply had a different perspective from ours -- not only when it came to food but also when it came to what constituted desirable work .
Nothing captures the difference in mind - set between East and West more than attitudes toward sweatshops .
Nike and other American companies have been hammered in the Western press over the last decade for producing shoes , toys and other products in grim little factories with dismal conditions .
Protests against sweatshops and the dark forces of globalization that they seem to represent have become common at meetings of the World Bank and the World Trade Organization and , this month , at a World Economic Forum in Australia , livening up the scene for Olympic athletes arriving for the competition .
Yet sweatshops that seem brutal from the vantage point of an American sitting in his living room can appear tantalizing to a Thai laborer getting by on beetles .
ADD YOUR THOUGHTS
Is it counterproductive for Westerners to attack sweatshops when many people in developing countries look to them for upward mobility ?
Add your thoughts .
Join a discussion with Nicholas D. Kristof and Sheryl WuDunn , the authors of " Thunder From the East : Portrait of a Rising Asia " ( Knopf ) .
Fourteen years ago , we moved to Asia and began reporting there .
Like most Westerners , we arrived in the region outraged at sweatshops .
In time , though , we came to accept the view supported by most Asians : that the campaign against sweatshops risks harming the very people it is intended to help .
For beneath their grime , sweatshops are a clear sign of the industrial revolution that is beginning to reshape Asia .
This is not to praise sweatshops .
Some managers are brutal in the way they house workers in firetraps , expose children to dangerous chemicals , deny bathroom breaks , demand sexual favors , force people to work double shifts or dismiss anyone who tries to organize a union .
Agitation for improved safety conditions can be helpful , just as it was in 19th - century Europe .
But Asian workers would be aghast at the idea of American consumers boycotting certain toys or clothing in protest .
The simplest way to help the poorest Asians would be to buy more from sweatshops , not less .
n our first extended trip to China , in 1987 , we traveled to the Pearl River delta in the south of the country .
There we visited several factories , including one in the boomtown of Dongguan , where about 100 female workers sat at workbenches stitching together bits of leather to make purses for a Hong Kong company .
We chatted with several women as their fingers flew over their work and asked about their hours .
" I start at about 6:30 , after breakfast , and go until about 7 p.m. , " explained one shy teenage girl .
" We break for lunch , and I take half an hour off then . "
" You do this six days a week ? "
" Oh , no .
Every day . "
" Seven days a week ? "
" Yes . "
She laughed at our surprise .
" But then I take a week or two off at Chinese New Year to go back to my village . "
The others we talked to all seemed to regard it as a plus that the factory allowed them to work long hours .
Indeed , some had sought out this factory precisely because it offered them the chance to earn more .
" It 's actually pretty annoying how hard they want to work , " said the factory manager , a Hong Kong man .
" It means we have to worry about security and have a supervisor around almost constantly . "
It sounded pretty dreadful , and it was .
We and other journalists wrote about the problems of child labor and oppressive conditions in both China and South Korea .
But , looking back , our worries were excessive .
Those sweatshops tended to generate the wealth to solve the problems they created .
If Americans had reacted to the horror stories in the 1980's by curbing imports of those sweatshop products , then neither southern China nor South Korea would have registered as much progress as they have today .
The truth is , those grim factories in Dongguan and the rest of southern China contributed to a remarkable explosion of wealth .
In the years since our first conversations there , we 've returned many times to Dongguan and the surrounding towns and seen the transformation .
Wages have risen from about $ 50 a month to $ 250 a month or more today .
Factory conditions have improved as businesses have scrambled to attract and keep the best laborers .
A private housing market has emerged , and video arcades and computer schools have opened to cater to workers with rising incomes .
A hint of a middle class has appeared -- as has China 's closest thing to a Western - style independent newspaper , Southern Weekend .
Partly because of these tens of thousands of sweatshops , China 's economy has become one of the hottest in the world .
Indeed , if China 's 30 provinces were counted as individual countries , then the 20 fastest -
growing countries in the world between 1978 and 1995 would all have been Chinese .
When Britain launched the Industrial Revolution in the late 18th century , it took 58 years for per capita output to double .
In China , per capita output has been doubling every 10 years .
In fact , the most vibrant parts of Asia are nearly all in what might be called the Sweatshop Belt , from China and South Korea to Malaysia , Indonesia and even Bangladesh and India .
Today these sweatshop countries control about one - quarter of the global economy .
As the industrial revolution spreads through China and India , there are good reasons to think that Asia will continue to pick up speed .
Some World Bank forecasts show Asia 's share of global gross domestic product rising to 55 to 60 percent by about 2025 -- roughly the West 's share at its peak half a century ago .
The sweatshops have helped lay the groundwork for a historic economic realignment that is putting Asia back on its feet .
Countries are rebounding from the economic crisis of 1997 - 98 and the sweatshops -- seen by Westerners as evidence of moribund economies -- actually reflect an industrial revolution that is raising living standards in the East .
f course , it may sound silly to say that sweatshops offer a route to prosperity , when wages in the poorest countries are sometimes less than $ 1 a day .
Still , for an impoverished Indonesian or Bangladeshi woman with a handful of kids who would otherwise drop out of school and risk dying of mundane diseases like diarrhea , $ 1 or $ 2 a day can be a life - transforming wage .
This was made abundantly clear in Cambodia , when we met a 40 - year - old woman named Nhem Yen , who told us why she moved to an area with particularly lethal malaria .
" We needed to eat , " she said .
" And here there is wood , so we thought we could cut it and sell it . "
But then Nhem Yen 's daughter and son - in - law both died of malaria , leaving her with two grandchildren and five children of her own .
With just one mosquito net , she had to choose which children would sleep protected and which would sleep exposed .
In Cambodia , a large mosquito net costs $ 5 .
If there had been a sweatshop in the area , however harsh or dangerous , Nhem Yen would have leapt at the chance to work in it , to earn enough to buy a net big enough to cover all her children .
For all the misery they can engender , sweatshops at least offer a precarious escape from the poverty that is the developing world 's greatest problem .
Over the past 50 years , countries like India resisted foreign exploitation , while countries that started at a similar economic level -- like Taiwan and South Korea -- accepted sweatshops as the price of development .
Today there can be no doubt about which approach worked better .
Taiwan and South Korea are modern countries with low rates of infant mortality and high levels of education ; in contrast , every year 3.1 million Indian children die before the age of 5 , mostly from diseases of poverty like diarrhea .
The effect of American pressure on sweatshops is complicated .
While it clearly improves conditions at factories that produce branded merchandise for companies like Nike , it also raises labor costs across the board .
That encourages less well established companies to mechanize and to reduce the number of employees needed .
The upshot is to help people who currently have jobs in Nike plants but to risk jobs for others .
The only thing a country like Cambodia has to offer is terribly cheap wages ; if companies are scolded for paying those wages , they will shift their manufacturing to marginally richer areas like Malaysia or Mexico .
Sweatshop monitors do have a useful role .
They can compel factories to improve safety .
They can also call attention to the impact of sweatshops on the environment .
The greatest downside of industrialization is not exploitation of workers but toxic air and water .
In Asia each year , three million people die from the effects of pollution .
The factories springing up throughout the region are far more likely to kill people through the chemicals they expel than through terrible working conditions .
By focusing on these issues , by working closely with organizations and news media in foreign countries , sweatshops can be improved .
But refusing to buy sweatshop products risks making Americans feel good while harming those we are trying to help .
As a Chinese proverb goes , " First comes the bitterness , then there is sweetness and wealth and honor for 10,000 years . "

Story Highlights •
Star explosion brightest that 's ever been observed
• A supernova involves the explosion of most of the material within a star
• SN 2006gy captured using orbiting and ground - based telescopes
• The explosion was about 238 million light years away from Earth
Adjust font size :
( CNN ) -- Scientists have just released images of the brightest stellar explosion recorded .
The supernova , known as SN 2006gy , was believed to be about 150 times as massive as the sun .
The explosion could help astronomers better understand how the first generation of stars in the universe died .
" This supernova stands out as the brightest supernova that 's ever been observed , " said Nathan Smith , astrophysicist at the University of California at Berkeley .
( Animation shows the violent death of a star )
" The reason we 're so excited is because it was so powerful we think it may require a new type of explosion mechanism that we 've never observed before , " said Smith at a news conference from NASA headquarters in Washington .
A supernova is a rare and often dramatic phenomenon that involves the explosion of most of the material within a star .
Supernovas can be very bright for a short time and usually release huge amounts of energy .
A graduate student using a robotic telescope that was part of the Texas Supernova Search project first detected SN 2006gy on September 18 , 2006 .
For about 70 days it got brighter , peaking with a brightness comparable to 50 billion suns , much brighter than most other supernovas .
Supernovas are usually bright for a couple of weeks at most .
Astronomers captured the star 's demise using NASA 's Chandra X - Ray Observatory , and ground - based telescopes at the Lick Observatory in California and the Keck Observatory in Hawaii .
The explosion was estimated about 238 million light years away from Earth .
Scientists believe supernova SN 2006gy expelled many of its outer layers in an eruption before its violent collapse .
When it exploded , it plowed into the cooler gases that had already been expelled , creating the brightest light show ever from a supernova .
Mario Livio , astrophysicist from the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , Maryland , calls the discovery " extraordinarily intriguing " for a theorist such as himself .
" We may be learning something entirely new about how massive stars explode , " said Livio .
" We are seeing a new type of explosion that has so far only existed in theory , and we believe the first stars in the universe exploded by this mechanism .
It may provide a new lesson in the evolution of stars , and a star in our own galaxy may do the same thing tomorrow , " he said .
Astronomers say the star that became SN 2006gy expelled a large amount of its mass before it exploded .
A huge star in the Milky Way , Eta Carinae , has already erupted in a similar fashion .
So if it explodes as a supernova , it could present the best light show seen , because it is a mere 7,500 light years away from our planet .
The orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory , which began its mission July 23 , 1999 , can detect and capture images of X - ray sources that are billions of light years away .
Scientists all over the world use it to get insight about high temperature events , such as black holes and collapsed stars that are millions of degrees Celsius .
Chandra is the largest satellite deployed from the space shuttle .
The observatory was named after Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar , the Indian - American astrophysicist who worked at the University of Chicago and won the 1983 Nobel prize in physics .
" Chandra " means " moon " or " luminous " in the Sanskrit language .
Ideas Diagnosing our Health Care Woes Health care privatization misses the real cause of Canada 's health care funding problem : Big Pharma .
By Ted Mitchell
Published November 28 , 2005
With a federal election on the horizon comes the inevitable talk of imminent health care breakdown .
Even physicians may be quick to leap to the conclusion that since the system is unsustainable , privatization of some sort is the only answer .
Whoa , just a minute .
Before you suggest a solution , make sure that you understand the problem .
The only meaningful question to ask is what parts of the system are unsustainable , growing at out - of - control rates ?
Even a cursory examination of the numbers will show that patented drugs and high technology diagnostics and therapeutics come out on top .
This sector is mostly privatized already , and we 're talking large multinational corporations .
It is not a classic self - adjusting free market .
This is a guaranteed market , with the taxpayer footing the bill .
Big Pharma is spared the costs of competition and has no worries about not getting paid .
And who politically would think of limiting drug benefits ?
Realize also that at the root of most waiting lists is a hospital that balks at paying for some super - expensive patented technology .
Physician factors are minor .
Everywhere we see surgeons begging for more operating room time .
Public funding of large private interests is a recipe for unchecked overspending when the demand is driven by a third party , i.e. patients .
This is always true .
The simple solution is to match public funding to public services ( which includes payments to physicians ) , and private money to private ones .
The former can easily regulate costs , and the latter self - regulates .
Not politically correct , but sustainable .
Patent Law and the Public Good
But wait : what about patients who would benefit from these drugs and technology and can't afford them ?
Indeed , there 's the rub .
But this ugly fact does not in any way disprove the above economic argument .
Instead , it raises another even more difficult question , that of patent law and the public good .
Although profit is Big Pharma 's primary goal , we have built a system where this private industry is almost solely responsible for research on drugs to improve the public good .
Should this unique arrangement fall under traditional patent law which will predictably limit access for a large segment of society ?
If such patents were scrapped would all research progress cease ?
Is there a middle ground and a more mature way of dealing with the problem ?
These are not easy questions , and addressing them implies there are serious limitations with our precious dominant capitalist dogma .
The Real Problem
The only way that privatization can help sustainability is through replacing provincial funding of drug benefits and hospital funding of that latest gazillion dollar artificial joint .
But since that is tough medicine to swallow , expect arguments that privatization of peripheral things such as physician services and hospital beds can somehow accomplish the same goal .
That is ridiculous .
If there are issues about inadequate hospital beds it is because funding has been slashed to attempt to pay for unsustainable private diagnostic and therapeutic advances .
That is the root problem and it requires fixing .
Privatizing basic services will have no beneficial effect on health care sustainability because it is the solution to a different problem - one that currently does n't exist .
Ted Mitchell is a Hamilton resident , emergency physician and sometimes agitator who recently completed a BEng at McMaster University .
He is fascinated by aspects of our culture that are harmful , but avoid serious public discussion .

A few weeks ago , we wrote about the top “ Ten Servers that Changed the World . ”
In reaction , I decided to make my own list …
The Ten Servers that Changed the Fictional World .
There are two guidelines for this list .
One , they must exist only in the world of movies or TV .
Second , they need to fit the following definition : A server is a computer system that provides services or data to other computing systems – called clients – over a network or other communication device .
With that said , here they are .
In no particular order …
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
1. Teletraan 1 – Transformers ( 1983 – 2007 )
You might not know much about the Transformers yet , but by next summer , you will .
If a server is a computer system that maintains and controls other computer systems , then Teletraan is definitely a server .
Teletraan is the computer that assisted and recreated the Autobots and Decepticons in the Transformers TV show .
It was the computer that picked out who would be a semi- truck and who would be a cassette recorder .
It routinely provided the lower computer systems ( i.e. Transformers ) with new data via the spy satellite or extensive database .
It was hardware built for imaging .
Real - world comparison :
When you think of a computer that excels in graphic design , you think of Apple .
So , in theory , we could compare Teletraan with Apple ’s Xserve .
Two dual - core 3GHz Xeon processors with a Xserve RAID for 7TB of Autobot history .
On ‘roids .
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
2. MCP – Tron ( 1982 )
The Master Control Program was a massive server running multiple programs at once .
The ENCOM corporation had many divisions , each one utilizing this mainframe server for storage and operation .
Each program could wander around the mainframe and interact with other programs , ultimately destroying the MCP or operating system and creating big problems .
( Not to mention the memory leaks in the RAM were out of control ! )
Clearly the hardware was in need of a revision .
ECC memory and Memory Protection were desperately needed .
In the end , the heroes celebrated their triumph over the MCP inside their virtual world .
Little did they know , come Monday , the IT admin would probably reload the “ damaged ” MCP software from a backup - tape – and they would all be deleted shortly after .
Real - world comparison :
The MCP could be compared to any modern day operating system .
The idea that the MCP would absorb other programs and take over their functions is not unheard of – for example , Apple launched the Dashboard after Konfabulator was created .
( And Microsoft has a few anti-trust suits under its belt to further illustrate this point . )
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
3. UNIX environment – Jurassic Park ( 1993 )
The UNIX environment here is a classic geek joke .
Everything we saw was real – created by Silicon Graphics and called IRIX .
InGen was the corporation funding the island , and from an IT perspective they let the worst possible thing happen : they allowed one programmer to design the infrastructure with no supervision .
What ’s worse , they obviously required no documentation of what was done .
The result was a kid had to hack in and gain ROOT privileges .
The likelihood of a young kid knowing a way to get ROOT ( and not a more experienced programmer ) is pretty hard to swallow .
The hardware for this server was probably minimal , running door locks and starting Quicktime movies .
“ We spared no expense ! ”
You would think that with the millions of dollars they spent on the park , they could have hired a couple newbie programmers and added a server on the backend .
Real - world comparison :
Since the actual screen shots used in the movie were based on real software , there is n’t much to compare .
This could have been any run of mill UNIX server with various dummy terminals .
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
4. WOPR ( War Operations Plan Response ) – WarGames ( 1983 )
The good people working at NORAD decided to give total control of the nuclear weapons to a computer , specifically the War Operations Plan Response server .
It was a computer they bought , and obviously did n’t research very well .
My biggest criticism of the WOPR is that the NORAD folks did n’t look at what they had – it had games on it .
Everyone knows , if you want a computer system to be optimized for its sheer power , you delete the games .
There ’s a reason that Windows Server 2003 does n’t come with Solitaire .
Real - world comparison :
The WOPR hardware itself was probably pretty simple , the radar information from around the country was fed in via fiber optic cables and interpreted as a whole .
Then the commands to the missiles could be phoned out and delivered via the 1200 bps modem ( remember this was 1983 ) .
The data analysis would n’t be much different from a weather station ’s software , with multiple servers being clustered together , commonly called a Beowulf Cluster .
( Also used for the Sony Playstation 2 . )
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
5. SKYNET – The Terminator ( 1984 )
The SKYNET computer was designed for missile defense , and I ’m guesssing nobody who designed this computer system saw “ WarGames ” ( see above ) .
The hardware for this server would have been some sort of distributed system , because if it was at one location , turning it off would have been simple .
The software running on SKYNET must have been very buggy at first .
( Imagine how incorrectly a child would learn everything if he was allowed to teach himself instead of being taught . )
Maybe that ’s why SKYNET began killing everyone once it got the chance .
Real - world comparison :
Although we ca n’t see it , most of the internet we use comes from an Akamai server .
It ’s a basic web / file server but it synchronizes constantly with other Akamai servers .
When you download a file , it comes from one of maybe hundreds of servers .
That ’s why the server does n’t go down when millions of people hit it at once .
All that needs to happen is for Akamai to gain control of our nuclear weapons .
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
6 . The Gibson – Hackers ( 1995 )
Hacking the Gibson has become a euphemism for showing off your skills .
The actual nature of this machine is much less showy .
The name comes from an homage to a sci- fi writer , William Gibson , and was used to calculate oil drilling locations and data .
The movie depicts this as a single computer , which does n’t exist in reality .
They do exist , however , in clusters .
The server from the movie ( aside from the gratuitous GUI ) is just a basic server running UNIX .
At the end of the movie , the IT team tried to fend off the attacks of hackers around the world .
If they only would ’ve had a stateful firewall in front of that server , they could have saved a lot of time .
The firewall would ’ve blocked all non-solicited traffic to the inside network , leaving only the telnet connections in , which could be turned off in a state of emergency .
Real - world comparison : GRID computing is similar to a Beowulf Cluster but differs in the open standard and distances .
The cluster needs the computers to be directly connected and running similar software .
The GRID concept allows computers all over the world , running different software , to contribute to the overall computing power .
An example of this would SETI@Home or Folding@Home .
The dream that a single server could analyze as much data as 10,000 desktop computers is just that – a dream .
— — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — — —————-
7 . The Source – The Matrix ( 1999 – 2003 )
The Source was a server that supplies data and services to multiple subsystems and computer networks , but the actual hardware is hard to imagine .
The movie explains the actual world with a unique , yet effective plot mechanism .
They do n’t know their own history and origins of the machine world .
Convenient .
Real - world comparison : A logical real - world equivalent to the Matrix is Second Life .
According to Linden Labs , they use servers that have two dual core processors which they call Class 4 .
They call the network of servers a “ grid , ” but only because of the layout , not because of distributed computing power .
Each server runs a specific area of the world .
There are disputes , but one report says there are 2,579 servers .
However , the World of Warcraft users will argue that they have the bigger , better world .
Second Life does n’t have as many users as World of Warcraft , but WoW has individual servers ( or realms ) and a relatively static world in comparison .
If you ’ve played Second Life , then you ’ll understand the comparison .
The world is so slow to render and low in quality and resolution that it becomes almost unbearable .
It would take some serious horsepower for a system to render a world so realistic , a human would believe in it .

8. HAL9000 - 2001 : A Space Odyssey ( 1968 )
The HAL9000 or SAL9000 ( the earthbound female counterpart ) was responsible for making decisions and carrying out orders aboard a spaceship when humans were not willing or capable of doing so .
The break - through on this server was the AI , supposedly the most sophisticated artificial intelligence man could produce .
When the movie was released , it was believed that this level of intelligence could be created by the year 2001 – but we now understand that it ’s much further away than anticipated .
Real - world comparison :
This computer has been compared to the Blue Gene .
The Blue Gene / L currently holds the top spot on the fastest super computer list with 131,072 processors .
It would be a top contender to play HAL9000 on the next space mission .
My only suggestion would be to have a kill switch incase HAL decides the humans are conflicting with orders and needs to be “ deleted . ”

9. VIKI – I , Robot ( 2004 )
V.I.K.I. is the governing intelligence behind all the robots in the film , “ I , Robot . ”
In the movie , V.I.K.I. is a positronic brain – a CPU that can create new pathways for each new task it learns .
While nobody has perfected the technology , they have patented it .
Eventually , the final product would be a computer that could be taught – a technology that seems inevitable based on CPU trends .
If you want to know more about positronic brains , watch some Star Trek , The Next Generation .
Real - world comparison :
This is a bit of a stretch , so bare with me .
V.I.K.I. was the server responsible for sending out updates and keeps tabs on all the robots in the world .
When she decided humans were a threat , she sent out a final update that allowed the robots to begin killing humans .
We currently have a server / client scenario that is marketed to sit in every family ‘s living room and receive commands from the “ mothership . ”
We call it Xbox Live .
So next time you are changing the CD in there , watch your fingers !
Microsoft could decide to send a lethal update to our Xboxes !

10 . Deep Thought - Hitchhikers Guide to the Galaxy ( 2005 )
The Deep Thought computer was created to answer one question .
What is the ultimate answer to Life , the Universe , and Everything ?
As you might imagine , the question is a bit vague .
So the computer begins to calculate the answer as it has been commanded .
After 7.5 million years , the answer is 42 .
The amount of computer cycles to compute all possibilities is quite large .
Calculating all the possibilities from a question is currently a busy project .
Real - world comparison :
There was a paper written by Philippe Oechslin , describing the benefit of Time vs Memory in computational speed .
It explained how you could calculate out all the possibilities in an algorithm and save the results , and then the software would only need to access the file instead of force the CPU to do the math .
Of course , the most applicable use of this has been for password cracking .
Rainbow tables are the result of this study .
The basic set of characters does n‘t take too long on top of the line hardware .
However , every good system administrator knows that enforcing complex passwords in a Windows domain is standard .
That means eight characters with a least one capital letter .
If you use that character set , you are looking at a bit longer .
Over 32 years on a single CPU computer , still much better than 7.5 million years !
History is filled with tales of politicians that wanted you to do as they say , but not as they do .
California State Senator Carole Migden joined that dubious ( and numerous ) group yesterday when she rear - ended a Honda sedan while traveling down Highway 12 in Solano County , in her state - issued SUV .
The Senator was allegedly reaching for her cell phone when she crashed into the driver in front of her .
The irony of this story lies in the fact that Senator Migden voted for a bill that would have outlawed cellphone usage while driving .
The good news is that her free SUV is a 2007 Highlander Hybrid , so at least Miss Midgen gets to think she 's fighting our country 's dependence on foreign oil .
The bad news is that she is not only driving around in an expensive vehicle at taxpayers expense , but we 'd put our money on the state being slapped with a lawsuit due to the Senator 's recklessness .
Can somebody tell us why state Senators get free cars anyway ?

I have made several previous posts about Jim Cramer , check
here
and
here
, and have suggested people should watch Jim Cramer for entertainment purposes , not for serious investment advice .
Slate Magazine 's Henry Blodget has a
new article
about Cramer , where he suggests that Jim Cramer " has committed professional suicide , " by admitting that he engaged in trading practices that are questionable at best , possibly illegal ?
Aside from those potentially serious ethical and legal issues , an even more important question might be :
How well did the performance of a portfolio of Mr. Cramer 's stock picks in 2006 stack up against a portfolio of passive index funds ?
Unfortunately for Cramer 's followers , not very well .
According to
Mad Money Machine
, the return in 2006 for a portfolio of mostly Vanguard Index funds was +20.6 % , compared to a - 0.20 % loss for a portfolio of " Select Jim Cramer Featured Stocks . "
A $ 100,000 investment at the beginning of the year would have grown to $ 120,612 by the end of 2006 , compared to only $ 99,805 for Cramer 's picks ( see chart above , click to enlarge ) .
Bottom Line : Watch Cramer for entertainment purposes only , call Vanguard or Fidelity for investment advice on index funds .
LUXEMBOURG -
The international community and Iran are " heading towards confrontation " over Tehran 's nuclear program , Mohamed ElBaradei , Director General of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) warned Thursday morning .
Defiance Iran will resist ' any threat , ' defense minister says Reuters Mostafa Mohammad Najjar warns
West in comments coinciding with US naval show of force off Islamic republic 's coast Iran will resist ' any threat , ' defense minister says
ElBaradei was speaking at a two - day conference in Luxembourg aimed at " preventing nuclear catastrophe , " organized by Russian Jewish Congress Chairman Viatcheslav Kantor .
" Its very difficult to say how close a country is to nuclear weapons , " ElBaradei said during a press conference .
" Iran is expanding its knowledge and capacity .
It now has over 1000 centrifuges .
I have expressed concern over this because the Agency is unable to conduct a robust and full inspection , " he added .
" My current priority is to carry out a comprehensive inspection , " ElBaradei said , adding that he estimated Iran was " three to eight years " from being capable of producing nuclear weapons .
The IAEA chief has come under criticism in recent days for suggesting that Iran has made so much progress on its nuclear program that the world should accept as " fact " that Iran will have the independent ability to enrich uranium .
On Wednesday , the IAEA released a report saying Iran was operating 1600 centrifuges independently .
US officials have described the report as " alarming , " while Iran said the report was " devoid of any new points . "
" We could end up with a major confrontation , " ElBaradei reiterated .
" Iran needs to listen to the international community and suspend enrichment , but the international community also needs to engage Iran .
We need a comprehensive settlement , " he added , saying , " the status quo is unacceptable . "
The IAEA head added that the issue represents " an emerging threat in a region that is in an absolute mess right now . "
Nuclear weapons expert Mark Fitzpatrick told Ynetnews that ElBaradei 's estimates may be too optimistic .
" If everything goes smoothly for Iran , it will be 2 - 3 years away from being able to produce nuclear weapons , " he said .
" It seems Iran is on track to having 3000 centrifuges by the middle of this summer .
It will take them about a year to get a hold of the technical issues and another year to enrich the uranium , hence my estimate of two years , " he added .
Fitzpatrick noted that up until 2003 , no less than 10 indicators were found to strongly suggest that Iran 's nuclear program had a military purpose .
" After 2003 , all those signs stopped , " he said .
" Did the Iranians stop ?
Or is it more secretive ?
There 's no reason to believe they stopped , " he added .
' Attack on Iran would be catastrophic '
Meanwhile , speaking to Ynetnews , former UN weapons inspector Hans Blix said a military strike on Iran would be a " catastrophic " option .
Blix , who is currently Chairman of the Weapons of Mass Destruction Commission , said previous military operations at nuclear programs , such as Israel 's strike on Iraq 's Osirak plant in 1982 , served to slow the nuclear program , but added that only a " durable occupation or regime change " could ensure that the program is not restarted .
" In all likelihood , an attack on Iran would be catastrophic , " Blix said , adding that the strike would rally support for Iranian President Ahmadinejad .
As a follow up to yesterday 's post on Bill Gates ' presentation style , I thought it would be useful to examine briefly the two contrasting visual approaches employed by Gates and Jobs in their presentations while keeping key aesthetic concepts found in Zen in mind .
I believe we can use many of the concepts in Zen and Zen aesthetics to help us compare their presentation visuals as well as help us improve our own visuals .
My point in comparing Jobs and Gates is not to poke fun but to learn .
Simplicity
A key tenet of the Zen aesthetic is kanso or simplicity .
In the kanso concept beauty , grace , and visual elegance are achieved by elimination and omission .
Says artist designer and architect Dr. Koichi Kawana , " Simplicity means the achievement of maximum effect with minimum means . "
When you examine your visuals , then , can you say that you are getting the maximum impact with a minimum of graphic elements , for example ?
When you take a look at Jobs ' slides and Gates ' slides , how do they compare for kanso ?
" Simplicity means the achievement of maximum effect with minimum means . "
— Dr. Koichi Kawana
Naturalness
The aesthetic concept of naturalness or shizen " prohibits the use of elaborate designs and over refinement " according to Kawana .
Restraint , then , is a beautiful thing .
Talented jazz musicians , for example , know never to overplay but instead to be forever mindful of the other musicians and find their own space within the music and within the moment they are sharing .
Graphic designers show restraint by including only what is necessary to communicate the particular message for the particular audience .
Restraint is hard .
Complication and elaboration are easy ... and are common .
The suggestive mode of expression is a key Zen aesthetic .
Dr. Kawana , commenting on the design of traditional Japanese gardens says :
" The designer must adhere to the concept of miegakure since Japanese believe that in expressing the whole the interest of the viewer is lost . "
— Dr. Koichi Kawana
In the world of PowerPoint presentations , then , you do not always need to visually spell everything out .
You do not need to ( nor can you ) pound every detail into the head of each member of your audience either visually or verbally .
Instead , the combination of your words , along with the visual images you project , should motivate the viewer and arouse his imagination helping him to empathize with your idea and visualize your idea far beyond what is visible in the ephemeral PowerPoint slide before him .
The Zen aesthetic values include ( but are not limited to ) :
Simplicity
Subtlety
Elegance
Suggestive rather than the descriptive or obvious
Naturalness ( i.e. , nothing artificial or forced ) ,
Empty space ( or negative space )
Stillness , Tranquility
Eliminating the non-essential
Gates and Jobs : lessons in contrasts
Take a look at some of the typical visuals used by Steve Jobs and those used by Bill Gates .
As you look at them and compare them , try doing so while being mindful of the key concepts behind the traditional Zen aesthetic .
Above .
Does it get more " Zen " than this ?
" Visual - Zen Master , " Steve Jobs , allows the screen to fade completely empty at appropriate , short moments while he tells his story .
In a great jazz performance much of the real power of the music comes from the spaces in between the notes .
The silence gives more substance and meaning to the notes .
A blank screen from time to time also makes images stronger when they do appear .
Also , it takes a confident person to design for the placement of empty slides .
This is truly " going naked " visually .
For most presenters a crowded slide is a crutch , or at least a security blanket .
The thought of allowing the screen to become completely empty is scary .
Now all eyes are on you .
Above .
Gates here explaining the Live strategy .
A lot of images and a lot of text .
Usually Mr. Gates ' slides have titles rather than more effective short declarative statements ( this slide has neither ) .
Good graphic design guides the viewer and has a clear hierarchy or order so that she knows where to look first , second , and so on .
What is the communication priority of this visual ?
It must be the circle of clip art , but that does not help me much .
Dr. Kawana says that " to reach the essence of things , all non-essential elements must be eliminated . "
So what is the essence of the point being made with the help of this visual ?
Are any elements in this slide non-essential ?
At its core , what is the real point ?
These are always good questions to ask ourselves , too , when critiquing our own slides .
Above .
Here Jobs is talking to developers at the WWDC'05 about the transition from the Power PC RISC chips to Intel .
Sounds daunting , but as he said ( and shows above ) Apple has made daunting major shifts successfully before .
( He also said sheepishly earlier in the the presentation , that every version of OSX secretly had an Intel version too ... so this is not a new thing .
The crowd laughed . ) .
A note on having an " open style "
One thing that would help Mr. Gates is an executive presentations coach and a video camera .
One unfortunate habit he has is constantly bringing his finger tips together high across his chest while speaking .
Often this leads to his hands being locked together somewhere across his chest .
This gesture makes him seem uncomfortable and is a gesture reminiscent of The Simpsons ' Mr. Burns .
By contrast , Steve Jobs has a more open style and at least seems comfortable and natural with his gestures .
Above .
Mr. Gates needs to read Cliff Atkinson 's Beyond Bullet Points , ironically published by Microsoft Press .
Atkinson says that " ... bullet points create obstacles between presenters and audiences . "
He correctly claims that bullets tend to make our presentations formal and stiff , serve to " dumb down " our points , and lead to audiences being confused ... and bored .
Rather than running through points on a slide , Atkinson recommends presenters embrace the art of storytelling , and that visuals ( slides ) be used smoothly and simply to enhance the speaker 's points as he tells his story .
This can be done even in technical presentations , and it can certainly be done in high - tech business presentations .
The " Microsoft Method " of presentation ?
The approach we 've seen in Microsoft 's last public presentation we can label the " Microsoft Method . "
This method is not different than the norm , in fact it is a perfect example of what Seth Godin and others call " Really Bad PowerPoint . "
Here 's the rub :
A great many professionals see the absurdity of this approach , even a great many professionals on the campus of Microsoft in Redmond .
But change will continue to be slow , especially when the executives of the company which produces the most popular slideware program in the world use the program in the most uninspiring , albeit typical way .
Above .
Chief technology Officer , Ray Ozzie follows the " Microsoft Method " too .
( Left ) Bullet No.3 : " ... interfaces through ... interfaces " ?
( Right ) Fundamental presentation rule :
Do not stick your hands in your pockets .
Informality is fine , but this is inappropriate even in the USA ( and especially in cultures outside the U.S. ) .
Refrain :
It all matters !
We 've talked about many presentation methods here at Presentation Zen , methods that are different than the " normal " or the " expected " but also simple , clear , and effective .
Who wants to be " average , " " typical , " or " normal " ?
Ridderstrale & Nordstorm say it best in Funky Business : " Normality is the route to nowhere . "
I 'm not suggesting you " present different " for the sake of being different .
I am saying that if you move far beyond what is typical and normal in the context of presentation design , you will be more effective and different and memorable .
Maybe Microsoft can afford lousy PowerPoint presentations , but you and I can't .
For " the rest of us , " it all matters .
Can we learn from a Japanese garden ?
Looking for inspiration in different places ?
Find a book on Japanese gardens ( like this one from my friend , designer Markuz Wernli Saito ) or visit one in your area ( if you are lucky enough to have one ) .
You can learn a bit here about the Zen aesthetic and Japanese gardens in this article by Dr. Kawana .
Living here in Japan
I have many chances to experience the Zen aesthetic , either while visiting a garden , practicing zazen in a Kyoto temple , or even while having a traditional Japanese meal out with friends .
I am convinced that a visual approach which embraces the aesthetic concepts of simplicity and the removal of the nonessential can have practical applications in our professional lives and can lead ultimately to more enlightened design .
