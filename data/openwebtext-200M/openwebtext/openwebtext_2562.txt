A strange little ritual used to go along with Polaroid cameras .
The shooter would grab the print as it came out of the camera and wave it in the air , as if that would stimulate the chemicals and make the picture appear faster .
It did n’t .
Yet it felt dumb to just stand there , waiting for the picture to develop .
Polaroid stopped making film packs last year , so this little piece of tech culture will soon be just a memory .
But just as the film - based Polaroid camera is fading away , along comes its digital replacement .
That ’s right : Polaroid was set to announce Thursday at the International Consumer Electronics
Show that it is introducing a digital camera that produces prints right on the spot .
You can even call them “ instant ” prints , but they take nearly a minute to appear , so they ’re only as “ instant ” as the old film prints .
Essentially , the $ 200 PoGo is a camera that contains a built - in color printer .
It produces 2 - by - 3 inch photos by selectively heating spots on specially treated paper .
It has nothing to do with the old chemical Polaroid process , but the prints convey some of the same Pop Art charm :
They ’re grainy and the colors are slightly off , with faces tending toward a deathly blue - green .
The camera is a successor to a standalone printer Polaroid put out last summer , designed to connect to camera phones and digital cameras .
When I reviewed it , I noted that if Polaroid combined the printer with an image sensor and an LCD screen , it would be a resurrection of the instant camera .
It turns out that ’s exactly what Polaroid was working on .
Unfortunately , you ’ll have to wait to get your hands on the camera : Polaroid says it will go on sale in late March or early April .
The camera is a fun product , and people who have been lamenting the death of the Polaroid will find solace in it .
Its prints can be peeled apart to reveal a sticky back , which makes them easy to paste on fridges , doors , books , computers , cell phones and other surfaces you want to personalize .
For a colleague ’s going - away party , I took a photo of him , printed out a couple of copies and pasted them on soda cans for an instant “ commemorative edition . ”
The PoGo also has crucial advantages over the old film cameras .
You can look at what you shot on the LCD screen , then choose whether you want to print it .
You can produce multiple prints of an image , or print something you shot some time ago .
The standalone printer and the new camera use the same paper , which costs $ 5 for a 10 - pack , or $ 13 for a 30 - pack .
It ’s expensive compared to inkjet paper , but about a third of the price of Polaroid film ( there are still stocks in stores ) .
No ink or toner is needed .
Despite its high points ,
The PoGo has the feel of a first - generation product , with noteworthy shortcomings .
As a camera , it ’s primitive .
It does n’t have auto - focus , just a switch for infinity or close - up shots .
The resolution is five megapixels , far below that of cheaper compact cameras .
Neither of these things matter much for the quality of the prints , which are small and of low resolution anyway , but they do matter if you want to use the digital captures for other purposes .
Like some other cheap digital cameras , there ’s a substantial lag from the time you press the shutter to when the picture actually is taken , making it nearly impossible to capture action or fleeting expressions .
The prints are narrower than the image captured by the sensor , so you ca n’t print the exact image you see on the screen .
Substantial slices are trimmed from the top and bottom of the image to produce the print .
In the default shooting mode , the camera does n’t warn you about this effect .
You can crop images you ’ve shot , zooming in on parts of them , but there is no way to reduce the size of the image to fit it all on the print .
The life of the rechargeable battery is limited , because of the energy needed to heat up the prints .
You can get a bit more than 20 prints on one charge if you do them in one sitting .
If you make a print only now and then , you ’ll get fewer on a charge , because the camera will need to heat up the print head every time .
( The old Polaroid cameras did n’t have battery problems , because most of them had batteries built into the film packs — a brilliant design .
But enough nostalgia . )
None of these flaws are fatal .
If you do n’t like the way the PoGo works as a camera , you can shoot pictures with another camera that uses an SD memory card , then move the card over to the PoGo and print the pictures .
But if that ’s what you plan to use the camera for , you might as well buy the $ 100 PoGo Instant Mobile Printer , which is slightly smaller .
It does n’t take memory cards , but will connect to other cameras with a USB cable .
The camera is much simpler to use than the printer , and it fits the bill for those who want to recapture the simple , spontaneous spirit of Polaroid shooting .
Sadly , Polaroid declared bankruptcy in December because of troubles at its parent company .
That puts the future supply of PoGo printer paper in question , but Polaroid is still operating , and it appears it will continue for the foreseeable future .
In any case , it ’s likely the portable printing technology will live on , because what it does is unique .
Utah Banks Await Instructions for Reducing Foreclosure Homes

By : John Cutts
Banks and mortgage lenders and servicers in Utah are not yet responding to inquiries on Obama�s $ 75 billion program for reducing the number of foreclosure homes .
They all say they have not yet received instructions or implementing procedures from their headquarters .
Even the U.S. Office of Housing and Urban Development in Utah has not received instructions , according to operations specialist Kelly Jorgensen .
Bank of Utah�s vice president Scott Parkinson explained the bank can release information only on or after March 4 , the date when financial institutions will be formally given details as heard from industry communications .
Lee VanDyke of Layton First National
Bank also can not provide details on the program to reduce foreclosure homes .
He says the press has just published the news .
He volunteered however that it is more likely that loan modifications would be offered through mortgage processing firms .
These usually are not banks even if the home loans were provided by the banks .
Wells Fargo , among the country�s largest mortgage servicing corporations , is also waiting for details on the foreclosure plan and on the decisions of investors .
The firm�s chief executive officer Mike Heid said Wells Fargo has stopped selling foreclosure homes until March 13 to enable troubled borrowers to explore their options under Obama�s scheme to reduce the number of foreclosure homes .
Heid also explained that it is not easier with holders of loans that Wells Fargo do not own but only service .
Wells Fargo has to work out the details of Obama�s plan with investors and owners of the mortgages .
Parkinson is almost saying the same thing as Heid .
He says that the Bank of Utah have sold most of its mortgages to other entities because the bank can not afford to have its money tied up by mortgage loans for long periods of time .
According to the University of Utah�s Bureau of Economic and Business Research , there are about 440,000 houses with mortgage loans across the state .
Although Utah is not among the states hit hard by soaring numbers of foreclosure homes , the state had 6,800 foreclosure homes in 2002 .
Using the national foreclosure rate of three percent , Utah could have about 13,000 foreclosure homes as of January .
The bureau�s director James Wood related that people were still buying houses on subprime mortgages with cheap promotional rates just before the housing meltdown in 2007 .
He also said that while Utah�s unemployment rate has always been lower than most states , the economic crisis has affected the state�s job market .
John Cutts has been educated in the finer points of the foreclosure market over 5 years .

Delegates confer with Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald at the 1933 summit
As delegates gather for the G20 summit in London on 2 April , it is worth looking to the last time London hosted a world economic summit .
In June 1933 , delegates from 66 countries gathered in London to try and agree plans to revive the world economy in the midst of the Great Depression .
The London Monetary and Economic Conference , organised by the League of Nations , aimed at reviving global trade , stabilising commodity prices , and restoring the gold standard .
Among those who gathered in London 's Geological Museum , hosted by UK Prime Minister Ramsay MacDonald , were eight prime ministers , 20 foreign ministers , 80 finance ministers and central bankers , and two heads of state - King Faisal of Iraq and Swiss President Edmund Schulthess .
G20 LONDON SUMMIT
World leaders will meet next month in London to discuss measures to tackle the downturn .
See our in - depth guide to the G20 summit .
The G20 countries are Argentina , Australia , Brazil , Canada , China , France , Germany , India , Indonesia , Italy , Japan , Mexico , Russia , Saudi Arabia , South Africa , South Korea , Turkey , the United Kingdom , the US and the EU .
Q&A : G20 Summit
What do sherpas do ?
Your views on the summit But within a month the conference had collapsed - torpedoed by the opposition of the new US President , Franklin D Roosevelt , to making any agreements that would restrict his freedom to act boldly to revive the US economy as part of the New Deal .
The bad faith engendered by that collapse had political as well as economic ramifications , with the French and British concluding that the US was an unreliable ally , while Germany 's new Chancellor , Adolf Hitler , was emboldened to move towards autarchy and rearmament in Germany .
Meanwhile , trade barriers went up across the world , countries engaged in competitive devaluations of their currencies , and rising unemployment contributed to political instability across Europe .
Contradictory messages FDR had pledged to revive the US economy through a New Deal The US played a key role in the 1933 conference , just as it will at the G20 meeting in April - even then it was the world 's largest economy , and also the most severely affected by the economic downturn .
And , in the midst of the Depression , it has also turned to a new leader to replace the discredited Republican administration of Herbert Hoover .
The new president appeared to embrace the cause of international cooperation .
The old fetishes of so - called international bankers are being replaced by efforts to plan national currencies
US President Franklin D Roosevelt , 3 July 1933
" I shall spare no effort to restore world trade by international economic readjustment , but the emergency at home cannot wait on that accomplishment , " President Roosevelt had said in his inaugural address in March 1933 .
And he appointed a strong advocate of free trade , Secretary of State Cordell Hull , to lead the US delegation .
But behind the scenes it was clear that FDR was hedging his bets .
He let private US bankers , led by James Warburg , begin secret negotiations on currency stabilisation with European central bankers led by the governor of the Bank of England , Montagu Norman .
But he also despatched his personal representative , Raymond Moley , to keep an eye on Mr Hull .
Roosevelt himself distanced himself from the conference , deliberately going on a sailing holiday off the coast of New England .
Bombshell message
The 1929 Wall Street crash led to a worldwide slump
But beyond the detailed negotiations there was a fundamental difference of approach between the US and Europe .
The European central bankers wished to return to the conservative principles of the gold standard , which fixed the value of their currencies and therefore forced countries to adjust wages and prices downwards if growth stalled .
The US government with its New Deal was determined to inflate the currency in order to reduce debt and spur expansion , and was sceptical about financial orthodoxy .
And FDR was determined to protect those areas of the economy , particularly agriculture , that had been hardest - hit by the downturn .
So on 3 July he telegraphed a " bombshell " message to the conference accusing it of bad faith and repudiating any attempt to get a deal to fix the value of currencies .
" I would regard it as a catastrophe mounting on a world tragedy , " FDR said , " if the conference should allow itself to be diverted by a purely artificial and temporary experiment ... the focus on ( currency ) stabilisation shows a singular lack of proportion and failure to remember the larger purposes for which the conference was called . "
And , he added that " the old fetishes of so - called international bankers are being replaced by efforts to plan national currencies " around domestic needs .
Contradictory Lessons PM
Ramsay MacDonald was deeply depressed by failure to reach international agreement
The intemperate message - which was popular in the US - led to the abandonment of the conference and the collapse of attempts to reach a coordinated international approach to the crisis .
The UK Prime Minister could not conceal his hurt at the breakdown of negotiations .
Ramsay MacDonald told the American delegation that " he was hurt by the tone of your message " which he felt was " that of one who stood apart and had little interest in the problems of other nations . "
The collapse in confidence , in turn , further reduced economic activity , and led to European nations turning inward , as it pushed the US on the road to isolationism for many years to come .
But current leaders draw different lessons from the breakdown .
For those organising the current G20 summit , the lesson is that boosting confidence by maintaining a united front in the face of the global recession has to be a key objective , whatever the concrete policies that can be agreed .
Critics of such summits , however , warn that they are dangerous because the risk of failure , and its negative effect on confidence , is greater than the potential gain from cooperation .
Hegemony However , many academics who have studied such negotiations draw another lesson .
They argue that meaningful international agreements are only possible when there is one dominant country that has the economic and political power to enforce a deal .
This was the case in 1944 when the US put through the Bretton Woods deal which created the IMF and World Bank , and in the 1950s when it initiated world trade talks .
But during the Depression , a weakened US had neither the economic power nor the political will to replace Europe as the organiser of the world economy .
With Europe even more divided now , the same issue could shape the G20 summit - whether the US , weakened by its own problems , really wants to take a leading role in sorting out the world 's problems as well as its own .
So , 76 years later , the fate of the world economy is again at the mercy of world politics .

Few economic indicators are of more concern to Americans than unemployment statistics .
Reports that unemployment rates are dropping make us happy ; reports to the contrary make us anxious .
But just what do unemployment figures tell us ?
Are they reliable measures ?
What influences joblessness ?
How Is Unemployment Defined and Measured ?
Each month , the federal government ’s Bureau of Labor Statistics randomly surveys sixty thousand individuals around the nation .
If respondents say they are both out of work and seeking employment , they are counted as unemployed members of the labor force .
Jobless respondents who have chosen not to continue looking for work are considered out of the labor force and therefore are not counted as unemployed .
Almost half of all unemployment spells end because people leave the labor force .
Ironically , those who drop out of the labor force — because they are discouraged , have household responsibilities , or are sick — actually make unemployment rates look better ; the unemployment rate includes only people within the labor force who are out of work .
Not all unemployment is the same .
Unemployment can be long term or short term .
It can be frictional , meaning someone is between jobs ; or it may be structural , as when someone ’s skills are no longer demanded because of a change in technology or an industry downturn .
Is Unemployment a Big Problem ?
Some say there are reasons to think that unemployment in the United States is not a big problem .
In June 2005 , for example , 33.5 percent of all unemployed people were under the age of twenty - four , and presumably few of them were the main source of income for their families .
One out of six of the unemployed are teenagers .
Moreover , the average duration of a spell of unemployment is short .
In June 2005 it was 16.3 weeks .
And the median spell of unemployment is even shorter .
In June 2005 it was 7.0 weeks , meaning that half of all spells last 7.0 weeks or less .
On the basis of numbers like the above , many economists have thought that unemployment is not a very large problem .
A few weeks of unemployment seems to them like just enough time for people to move from one job to another .
Yet these numbers , though accurate , are misleading .
Much of the reason why unemployment spells appear short is that many workers drop out of the labor force at least temporarily because they cannot find attractive jobs .
Often two short spells of unemployment mean a long spell of joblessness because the person was unemployed for a short time , withdrew from the labor force , and then reentered the labor force .
And even if most unemployment spells are short , most weeks of unemployment are experienced by people who are out of work for a long time .
To see why , consider the following example .
Suppose that each week , twenty spells of unemployment lasting 1 week begin , and only one begins that lasts 20 weeks .
Then the average duration of a completed spell of unemployment would be only 1.05 weeks .
But half of all unemployment ( half of the total of 40 weeks that the twenty - one people are out of work ) would be accounted for by spells lasting 20 weeks .
Something like this example applies in the real world .
In June 2005 , for example , 42.9 percent of the unemployed had been unemployed for less than five weeks , but 16.9 percent had been unemployed for six or more months .
What Causes Long - Term Unemployment ?
To fully understand unemployment , we must consider the causes of recorded long - term unemployment .
Empirical evidence shows that two causes are welfare payments and unemployment insurance .
These government assistance programs contribute to long - term unemployment in two ways .
First , government assistance increases the measure of unemployment by prompting people who are not working to claim that they are looking for work even when they are not .
The work - registration requirement for welfare recipients , for example , compels people who otherwise would not be considered part of the labor force to register as if they were a part of it .
This requirement effectively increases the measure of unemployed in the labor force even though these people are better described as nonemployed — that is , not actively looking for work .
In a study using state data on registrants in Aid to Families with Dependent Children and food stamp programs , my colleague Kim Clark and I found that the work - registration requirement actually increased measured unemployment by about 0.5 to 0.8 percentage points .
If this same relationship holds in 2005 , this requirement increases the measure of unemployment by 750,000 to 1.2 million people .
Without the condition that they look for work , many of these people would not be counted as unemployed .
Similarly , unemployment insurance increases the measure of unemployment by inducing people to say that they are job hunting in order to collect benefits .
The second way government assistance programs contribute to long - term unemployment is by providing an incentive , and the means , not to work .
Each unemployed person has a “ reservation wage ” — the minimum wage he or she insists on getting before accepting a job .
Unemployment insurance and other social assistance programs increase that reservation wage , causing an unemployed person to remain unemployed longer .
Consider , for example , an unemployed person who is accustomed to making $ 15.00 an hour .
On unemployment insurance this person receives about 55 percent of normal earnings , or $ 8.25 per lost work hour .
If that person is in a 15 percent federal tax bracket and a 3 percent state tax bracket , he or she pays $ 1.49 in taxes per hour not worked and nets $ 6.76 per hour after taxes as compensation for not working .
If that person took a job that paid $ 15.00 per hour , governments would take 18 percent for income taxes and 7.65 percent for Social Security taxes , netting him or her $ 11.15 per hour of work .
Comparing the two payments , this person may decide that an hour of leisure is worth more than the extra $ 4.39 the job would pay .
If so , this means that the unemployment insurance raises the person ’s reservation wage to above $ 15.00 per hour .
Unemployment , therefore , may not be as costly for the jobless person as previously imagined .
But as Harvard economist Martin Feldstein pointed out in the 1970s , the costs of unemployment to taxpayers are very great indeed .
Take the example above of the individual who could work for $ 15.00 an hour or collect unemployment insurance of $ 8.25 per hour .
The cost of unemployment to this unemployed person was only $ 4.39 per hour , the difference between the net income from working and the net income from not working .
And as compensation for this cost , the unemployed person gained leisure , whose value could well be above $ 4.39 per hour .
But other taxpayers as a group paid $ 8.25 in unemployment benefits for every hour the person was unemployed , and got back in taxes only $ 1.49 on this benefit .
Moreover , they gave up $ 3.85 in lost tax and Social Security revenue that this person would have paid per hour employed at a $ 15.00 wage .
Net loss to other taxpayers : $ 10.61 ( $ 8.25 − $ 1.49 + $ 3.85 ) per hour .
Multiply this by millions of people collecting unemployment , each missing hundreds of hours of work , and you get a cost to taxpayers in the billions .
Unemployment insurance also extends the time a person stays off the job .
Clark and I estimated that the existence of unemployment insurance almost doubles the number of unemployment spells lasting more than three months .
If unemployment insurance were eliminated , the unemployment rate would drop by more than half a percentage point , which means that the number of unemployed people would fall by about 750,000 .
This is all the more significant in light of the fact that less than half of the unemployed receive insurance benefits , largely because many have not worked enough to qualify .
Another cause of long - term unemployment is unionization .
High union wages that exceed the competitive market rate are likely to cause job losses in the unionized sector of the economy .
Also , those who lose high - wage union jobs are often reluctant to accept alternative low - wage employment .
Between 1970 and 1985 , for example , a state with a 20 percent unionization rate , approximately the average for the fifty states and the District of Columbia , experienced an unemployment rate that was 1.2 percentage points higher than that of a hypothetical state that had no unions .
To put this in perspective , 1.2 percentage points is about 60 percent of the increase in normal unemployment between 1970 and 1985 .
There is no question that some long - term unemployment is caused by government intervention and unions that interfere with the supply of labor .
It is , however , a great mistake ( made by some conservative economists ) to attribute most unemployment to government interventions in the economy or to any lack of desire to work on the part of the unemployed .
Unemployment was a serious economic problem in the late nineteenth and early twentieth centuries prior to the welfare state and widespread unionization .
Unemployment then , as now , was closely linked to general macroeconomic conditions .
The great depression , when unemployment in the United States reached 25 percent , is the classic example of the damage that collapses in credit can do .
Since then , most economists have agreed that cyclical fluctuations in unemployment are caused by changes in the demand for labor , not by changes in workers ’ desires to work , and that unemployment in recessions is involuntary .
Even leaving aside cyclical fluctuations , a large part of unemployment is due to demand factors rather than supply .
High unemployment in New England in the early 1990s , for example , was due to declines in computer and other industries in which New England specialized .
High unemployment in northern California in the early 2000s was caused by the dot - com bust .
The process of adjustment following shocks is long and painful , and recent research suggests that even temporary declines in demand can have permanent effects on unemployment , as workers who lose jobs are unable to sell their labor due to a loss of skills or for other reasons .
Therefore , most economists who study unemployment support an active government role in training and retraining workers and in maintaining stable demand for labor .
The Natural Rate of Unemployment
Long before Milton Friedman and Edmund Phelps advanced the notion of the natural rate of unemployment ( the lowest rate of unemployment tolerable without pushing up inflation ) , policymakers had contented themselves with striving for low , not zero , unemployment .
Just what constitutes an acceptably low level of unemployment has been redefined over the decades .
In the early 1960s an unemployment rate of 4 percent was both desirable and achievable .
Over time , the unemployment rate drifted upward and , for the most part , has hovered around 7 percent .
Lately , it has fallen to 5 percent .
I suspect that some of the reduction in the apparent natural rate of unemployment in recent years has to do with reduced transitional unemployment , both because fewer people are between jobs and because they are between jobs for shorter periods .
Union power has been eroded by domestic regulatory action and inaction , as well as by international competition .
More generally , international competition has restrained wage increases in high - wage industries .
Another factor making unemployment lower is a decline in the fraction of the unemployed who are supported by unemployment insurance .

SINGAPORE ( Reuters ) - Bushfires that have scorched Australia ’s Victoria state released millions of tons of carbon dioxide and forest fires could become a growing source of carbon pollution as the planet warms , a top scientist said on Thursday .

Mark Adams of the University of Sydney said global warming could trigger a vicious cycle in which forests could stop becoming sinks of CO2 , further accelerating the rise of the planet - warming gas in the atmosphere .
“ With increasing concerns about rising CO2 , rising temperatures and reduced rainfall in many of the forested areas , then we could well see much greater emissions from forest fires , ” Adams , dean of the Faculty of Agriculture , Food and Natural Resources , told Reuters .
The Victoria fires , which killed more than 200 people , were the worst in the nation ’s history and many are still burning .
Firefighters battled seven wildfires in the state on Wednesday , hoping to control the flames before expected higher temperatures hit the fire - ravaged state on Friday .
“ Scientists worldwide are worried about fires and forests .
It does n’t matter if it ’s the Arctic tundra fires , or peat fires in Kalimantan or bushfires in Australia , ” said Adams , who has worked in collaboration with the Bushfire Co-operative Research Center .
In a submission to the United Nations last year , the Australian government said wildfires in 2003 released 190 million tons of CO2 - equivalent , roughly a third of the nation ’s total greenhouse gas emissions for the year .
Such large , one - off releases of CO2 and other greenhouse gases such as methane , are not presently accounted for in Australia ’s annual list of national greenhouse gas emissions .
If they were , the country would vastly exceed its emission limits under the Kyoto Protocol , the United Nations ’ main weapon to fight climate change .
Which is why Australia is calling for amendments to rules on land use change under the United Nations so that only human activities that “ can be practicably influenced ” are included .
Adams said U.N. climate talks at the end of the year in Denmark that aim to agree on a successor pact to Kyoto , should discuss the growing threat from forest fires and how to develop better legal frameworks to tackle the problem .
MAJOR PROBLEM
Adams , who has studied how much carbon Australia ’s forests and soil can store , has estimated that fires in 2003 , which ravaged the capital Canberra , and in 2006 - 07 released about 550 million tons of CO2 .
The current fires had already burned hundreds of thousands of hectares , he said , in areas with total carbon content of 200 tons per hectare or more .
Australia , though , was not the only concern .
Annual fires in Indonesia also release vast amounts of CO2 .
Huge fires in 1997 released up to 6 billion tons of CO2 , covering Southeast Asia in thick haze and causing a spike in global levels of the gas .
Research on the forest and peat fires by a team of international scientists found the blazes released the equivalent of up 40 percent of global annual emissions from burning fossil fuels .
Adams said the research was a wake - up call .
“ When you see the step - increases ( of CO2 ) that they observed , we have to sit up and take notice , that fires are a major problem , ” said Adams .
He said in the past , native forest carbon had been in rough equilibrium over millions of years with fires , with very small accretion of carbon over very long periods of time .
“ But then if you add rapid climate change and much greater fire frequency , the equilibrium carbon content of the native forests , instead of going up , is going to go down . ”
It took three hours for about 15 masked workers and police officers to remove 118 cats from a couple 's reeking home in the Lowry Grove Mobile Home Park in St. Anthony on Tuesday .
Another dozen or so cats could n't be captured because they were hiding in mounds of dolls and debris in the trailer and will have to be live - trapped , said Keith Streff , senior investigator of the Animal Humane Society in Golden Valley .
One cat escaped and three were left with the couple , the limit permitted by city ordinance .
Authorities have seen such cases before .
The woman fits the classic profile of an obsessive - compulsive animal hoarder , " which is sad for both animals and owners , " Streff said .
In 2002 , Humane Society workers removed 72 cats from the same couple 's residence when they lived in Coon Rapids , he said .
The couple , identified by police as Stanley and Cheryl Saladis , who are in their 50s , appeared physically OK but had feces on their shoes and pants cuffs , Streff said .
Cheryl Salidas will be given a mental health evaluation , he added .
Police Chief John Ohl said Stanley Salidas accompanied his wife to Hennepin County Medical Center in Minneapolis .
Hennepin County health officials declared the trailer uninhabitable for 10 days , during which the couple can try to clean it to meet health and building - code standards , Ohl said .
Police had received no calls about the trailer until Monday when a " concerned citizen " called , he said .
Officers " found a significant problem , " he said .
Streff said he will compile a report for the city attorney , who may consider misdemeanor animal neglect charges against the two .
The couple moved to the trailer park , at Stinson Boulevard and Lowry Avenue , in 2004 and began collecting stray cats , which bred in the trailer , Streff said .
No dead cats were found , and Streff said those removed appeared to be in decent shape considering the foul conditions .
" I 'm not Jewish , I 'm not an Arab and I 'm not a terrorist , " he wrote on his website .
" I just think people who blow themselves up are stupid .
That 's all this game is . "
Entrepreneur Needed for Winter Solar Power Fix
January 8th , 2009 by Susan Kraemer
“ … in regions where homeowners have long rolled their eyes at shoveling driveways , add another cold - weather chore : cleaning off the solar panels .
“ At least I can get to them with a long pole and a squeegee , ” said Alan Stankevitz , a homeowner in southeast Minnesota . ”
As he patiently squeegees off his stationary solar panels , day , after day , after day , throughout the long arduous winter in Minnesota …
Do you just accept this story as further proof that “ it is n’t easy being green ” ?
Do you see no alternative for this poor man but to just go out there and work this backbreaking labor for green energy ?
Do I hear you snort derisively ?
Or … are you able to think creatively ?
Come on ; give me your ideas for solving this .
How hard would it be to plan for this kind of weather condition ?
Could n’t cold weather solar providers offer a solution to this problem ?
I can see two very easy possible fixes right away .
What solutions can you think of ?
Caveat .
Renewable solutions do not utilize fossil power .
Let me know your ideas in the comments .
Maybe you will start the little startup that makes millions off that solution … and we at Cleantechnica can write about your idea in a few years .
This blog brings you news of renewable solutions invented by others daily .
Today , its your turn to sharpen your thinking - out - of - the - box skills .
The market for this snowy climate solar solution should be good , because :
“ On the other hand , the panels can get extra power from sunlight reflected off nearby snow .
And like other electronic gear , solar panels work better when cold .
Mr. Stankevitz said that on some rare winter days , when the Minnesota sky is clear , the weather is freezing and the sun is shining brightly , his panels can briefly churn out more electricity than they were designed to produce , more than on the balmiest days of summer . ”

and you 're feeling lucky : Baseball season has started again .
On your way home from Shea Stadium to take in the Mets ' home opener — they beat the Phillies 1 - 0 in a thrilling fourteen - inning affair — you stumble across a scratch - off ticket worth $ 1,000 .
You resolve to invest the money the next morning in an asset of your choosing , not cashing out until exactly ten years later .
How might you have made the most of your good fortune ?
Not by investing in stocks : $ 1,000 invested in the Dow Jones Industrial Average on April 1 , 1998 , would have been worth $ 1,427 ten years later .
Cash , in fact , would have produced a higher return :
Putting your money in a six - month CD and rolling it over twice a year would have returned you $ 1,481 .
Better yet would have been a ten - year Treasury note , which would have yielded $ 1,564 by maturity .
And better still would have been real estate :
Even with your having to endure the beginnings of the housing crunch , $ 1,000 in home equity on April 1 , 1998 , would have been worth $ 2,167 ten years later .
But your best investment option would have been to drive back to the stadium and buy a piece of the Metropolitans .
The Mets , according to Forbes , were worth $ 193 million in 1998 but had appreciated to $ 824 million in April of last year :
You would have more than quadrupled your money .
And the Mets were hardly alone in this regard ; the average major league team appreciated by almost 150 percent during this period , and so a portfolio of baseball investments worth $ 1,000 in 1998 would have been worth $ 2,476 in 2008 .
Unless you were drinking buddies with one of the founders of Google , you would have had trouble doing much better on your investment .
Why do baseball teams seem to thrive as seemingly every other investment fails ?
How can the Yankees , in the midst of a recession , get away with shelling out $ 161 million to three - hundred - pound pitcher CC Sabathia , or with charging $ 500 a head for premium seats at the new stadium ?
Will the baseball bubble ever collapse ?
There are , arguably , some signs of weakness .
More than half of baseball 's thirty clubs are freezing or reducing season - ticket prices , according to USA Today .
And while Sabathia and the Yankees ' other new blue - chippers , Mark Teixeira and A. J. Burnett , have made out very well for themselves , an unprecedented number of free agents were still searching for a home as the snow began to thaw , including All - Stars like Manny Ramirez , Adam Dunn , and Ben Sheets .
A catastrophic collapse of the baseball market remains unlikely , however , for two reasons .
First , major league baseball is a monopoly with a legal exemption from antitrust laws , and therefore it 's not subject to the ordinary laws of supply and demand .
In 1908 — the last time the Cubs won the World Series — there were sixteen major league baseball clubs for about 89 million American citizens , or one team per 5.6 million potential fans .
But now there are thirty clubs for around 300 million Americans — just one to go around per 10 million of us .
If not for its monopoly status , there might be forty or sixty major league baseball clubs , and the individual franchises would be less valuable .
But because of it , buying a piece of a baseball club is a bit like marrying into the Rockefeller trust .
Second , and a little surprisingly , the sport has already begun to do something that so many other industries have struggled with : rationalize its pay structure .
In the winter before its 2007 season , the industry spent a total of about $ 1.7 billion in commitments to free - agent contracts .
But that amount dipped to " only " $ 1.1 billion last winter and should finish at around the same total this year .
To understand the origins of this correction , read Michael Lewis 's 2003 book , Moneyball , which documented the success of the Oakland A's in building one of the game 's winningest franchises in spite of a small payroll and a decrepit ballpark .
The A's used statistical analysis — the term of art is " sabermetrics , " after the Society for American Baseball Research — to identify inefficiencies in the market , such as the tendency of baseball clubs to overrate ( and overpay for ) statistics like home runs and underrate those like on - base percentage .
The thing about Moneyball , however , is that its lessons have nothing really to do with small - market clubs ; higher - revenue franchises like the Yankees and the Mets are just as capable of applying them .
And one large - market club in particular , the Red Sox , has done so especially successfully , having won two World Series titles since making the then - heretical move of hiring statistical guru Bill James in 2002 .
Most clubs , indeed , having witnessed the turnaround of the Red Sox , have become extremely friendly toward statistical and analytical techniques .
And ownership structures in baseball have also changed .
Instead of being run as oversized family businesses or vanity offshoots of large corporations , most baseball clubs are now operated by smaller partnerships , sometimes including former investment bankers and hedge - fund managers who know how to manage risks and work the numbers .
But perhaps the principal inefficiency that baseball clubs have discovered in recent years is that they were paying too much for free agents .
This inefficiency has not necessarily affected players at the top of the market , like Sabathia and Teixeira , whose talents are extremely scarce .
Between 2005 and 2007 , baseball averaged eleven free agents per year who signed new contracts paying them at least $ 10 million per season .
That number has n't decreased any :
There were twelve such contracts signed in 2008 and there have been ten — as of this writing — thus far in 2009 .
Rather , it 's baseball 's upper - middle class — those players who are good but often no better than their younger , cheaper counterparts — who have suffered the brunt of the correction .
In 2007 , there were twenty - nine free agents who signed contracts paying them between $ 5 million and $ 10 million per season .
That number dropped to just eleven last year .
Likewise , there were seventy - one free agents in 2007 who signed deals for $ 1 to $ 5 million per season but just fifty - three in 2008 .
Meanwhile , teams have begun to hedge their risks by signing players — especially injury - prone pitchers — to contracts of shorter duration .
Whereas in 2007 , thirty - three players were signed to deals totaling three seasons or more in length , that number was just thirteen in 2008 ( including only five pitchers ) and wo n't be more than fifteen or sixteen in 2009 .
Baseball 's bubble is proving hardier than most , but it 's not only because of luck and the law .
The industry , in just a few years , has arguably made up for decades ' worth of inefficiencies .
If only the rest of the economy could be so lucky .

LOS ANGELES – Steven Spielberg may be moving to the Walt Disney Company .
DreamWorks SKG , Mr. Spielberg ’s boutique production company , is in advanced talks on a deal to distribute its movies through Disney , according to four people with knowledge of the talks but who asked for anonymity because negotiations are not complete .
A deal with Disney , which could come as soon as Friday , would replace one Mr. Spielberg arranged with Universal Pictures just four months ago after an acrimonious divorce from Paramount Pictures .
Spokeswomen from Walt Disney and Universal declined to comment .
Stacey Snider , the chief executive of DreamWorks , declined to comment .
Disney had been a suitor for DreamWorks back in October , and Stacey Snider , the chief executive of DreamWorks , and David Geffen , the co-founder of the studio , were keen to align with the company .
But Mr. Spielberg ultimately overruled them , concluding that Universal – where he made his first blockbuster and where he still maintained offices – was the right fit .
Since then , however , the landscape in Hollywood has changed .
DreamWorks , running into the buzz saw of the economic slowdown , has been unable to find the motion picture production funds to match the $ 500 million in funding that Reliance Big Entertainment committed to re-build the studio .
Mr. Spielberg has even injected personal funds to buy time .
Disney ’s motion picture studio , meantime , has been struggling .
In the most recent quarter , Disney reported a 64 percent drop in income at the division , largely due to a decline in DVD sales around the world .
The studio ’s Touchstone label has been a disaster of late , with the films “ Miracle at St. Anna ” and “ Swing Vote ” ignored in the marketplace .
Miramax , another Disney division , has had modest box office success with “ Doubt , ” but has had a diminished profile overall in recent years .
Disney also has room on its schedule to accommodate the four to six films DreamWorks plans to produce .
In 2006 , Disney limited the number of movies it makes to about 12 from as many as 20 in previous years , choosing to focus more intently on family films made on the Walt Disney Pictures brand .
Universal Pictures issued a statement Friday acknowledging that DreamWorks was shopping elsewhere .
“ Universal Pictures has ended discussions with DreamWorks for a distribution agreement , ” it said .
“ Over the past several weeks , DreamWorks has demanded material changes to previously agreed upon terms .
It is clear that DreamWorks ’ needs and Universal ’s business interests are no longer in alignment .
We wish them luck in their pursuit of funding and distribution of their future endeavors . ”

The advertising watchdog has decided not to launch a formal investigation into a controversial advertisement from the Christian party proclaiming that " there is definitely a God " , even though it has become one of the four most criticised adverts of all time .
The advertisement was unveiled by the party last month in response to the British Humanist Association 's bus adverts , which state : " There 's probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life . "
The Christian party 's advert – displayed on 50 London buses – carries the slogan : " There definitely is a God .
So join the Christian party and enjoy your life . "
Figures from the Advertising Standards Authority reveal that the advertisement has so far attracted 1,045 complaints – and rising – making it the fourth most complained about advert since the ASA 's records began .
But it has decided not to launch an investigation because the poster is deemed to be ' electioneering material ' , and falls outside the remit of its codes of practice .
The ASA says it has been deluged with complaints since the beginning of the year , indicating the extent to which advertising has become the latest battleground between conflicting ideologies .
Last month the Christian party 's London headquarters were vandalised in an attack which police believe was a religious hate crime .
A spokesman for the ASA said today : " We will not be investigating the Christian party advert .
We do not play the numbers game , it is about measuring the complaints against the advertising codes and judging whether or not there appear to be a problem under the rules . "
He said the Christian party ad was not investigated because the primary purpose of the poster was to promote the party .
" The advert was electioneering material as defined by clause 12.1 and therefore not subject to the code . "
The clauses states : " Any advertisement or direct marketing communication , whenever published or distributed , whose principal function is to influence voters in local , regional , national or international elections or referendums is exempt from the Code . "
In January the ASA concluded that the aetheist " There 's probably no God " bus ad campaign by the British Humanist Association did not breach the current advertising code and again decided not to launch an investigation .
That advert attracted 326 complaints , some complaining that the ad was offensive and denigratory to people of faith .
Others challenged whether the advert was misleading because the advertiser would not be able to substantiate its claim that God " probably " does not exist .
The ASA council concluded that the ad was an expression of the advertiser 's opinion and that the claims in it were not capable of objective substantiation .
Although it acknowledged that the content of the ad would be at odds with the beliefs of many , it concluded that it was unlikely to mislead or to cause serious or widespread offence .
People complaining about the Christian party advert believe the claim " there definitely is a God " is misleading because it cannot be substantiated , while some individuals have also objected that the advert is offensive to atheists .
But the ASA spokesman said that even if the advert had fallen within the remit of its code , it was unlikely it would have investigated because of its decision not to investigate the aetheist bus campaign .
The codes are being reviewed to streamline them and a public consultation is expected to be launched before the end of the month .
The ASA has also decided not to investigate two other advertising campaigns of a similar nature .
An advertisement from the Russian Orthodox Church that stated " There IS a God , BELIEVE .
Do n't worry and enjoy your life " was , the ASA council considered , a reflection of the opinion of the advertisers and unlikely to mislead readers .
Similarly , the Trinitarian Bible Society 's ad that claimed " The fool hath said in his heart , There is no God. Psalm 53.1 " generated complaints that it was offensive and was insulting to atheists and non-Christians .
Some also objected that the ad was misleading because it implied that God exists .
People seem to have a lot of odd ideas about masturbation .
And one of them comes from Kellogg , of Kellogg ’s cereals .
In the early part of this century , John Harvey Kellogg gained a reputation both as a nutritionist and a sexual adviser .
The foods that Kellogg created ( including the now - famous corn flakes ) were designed to promote health and decrease interest in sex .
Mr. Kellogg thought sex was the ultimate abomination and remained celibate even in marriage .
Masturbation was the worst sin imaginable to him .
He believed it led to leprosy , tuberculosis , heart disease , epilepsy , dimness of vision , insanity , idiocy , and death .
He also preached that masturbation led to bashfulness in some people , unnatural boldness in others , a fondness for spicy foods , round shoulders , and acne .
That ’s quite a list !
As we all know now , there are most definitely foods that promote health , but none in particular that decrease interest in sex or masturbation .
So , you can eat all the corn flakes you want , and have good , safe sex !
I am a 26 - year - old female who masturbates regularly .
I have great orgasms quite easily by simply rubbing my clitoris .
When I am having intercourse , however , I almost never have an orgasm .
Could this be because of the way I masturbate ?
It is highly unlikely that your manner of masturbating is the reason you find it difficult to have orgasms during intercourse .
Most women masturbate by stimulating their clitoris in some way .
Like any good inventor it seems Kamen is a wee bit eccentric , having declared the island to be an independent state with its own currency ( in increments of Pi ) and its own navy , consisting solely of the amphibious vehicle we can see parked beside the north - east building .
Although his independence is n’t officially recognised Kamen even signed a non-aggression pact with then - president George H.W. Bush .
Kamen has also erected a replica of Stonehenge to one corner of his island , where I ’m guessing he might drive a Segway around the stones , naked and chanting .

With a surfeit of graduates for the available funds , the US scientific endeavour is increasingly losing its lustre as a career choice .
The country needs to take stock and plan more carefully for the future .
Jill Rafael - Fortney and Darcy Kelley , the two scientists profiled in this issue ( see page 650 ) , are both struggling to keep their laboratories going in an extremely tough funding environment .
They are also two human faces of an increasingly dire career crisis that is afflicting young researchers across the United States , as too many scientists chase an all - too - finite supply of jobs and money .
The leaders of science and their allies in Congress would do well to keep such faces in mind as they map out the future of the US scientific enterprise .
The economic stimulus package currently working its way through Congress is likely to inject billions of dollars into the budgets of the scientific agencies , which will no doubt be welcome to researchers ( see Nature 457 , 364–365 ; 2009 ) .
But without careful planning and sustained follow - up funding , that sudden infusion of money could end up worsening the career crisis rather then easing it .
Indeed , it could readily become a replay of what happened after the budget of the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) was doubled between 1998 and 2003 , when the extra money drew in new scientists who then foundered when the budget virtually flat - lined in subsequent years .
The reality is that neither the United States nor any other nation knows how to calculate the number of scientists and engineers it currently needs , let alone how many it will require in the future .
But at the moment , some signs suggest that the United States may have a surplus .
Supply and demand
“ US leaders should commit to long - term , predictable growth in the science budgets , not just a quick infusion of cash . ”
This mismatch long predates the present financial meltdown , and it affects many areas .
The career crisis is especially stark in the biomedical fields , where the number of tenure - track and tenured positions has not increased in the past two decades even as universities have nearly doubled their production of biomedical doctorates .
Those who do land jobs in academic research are struggling to keep them , because competition for grant money in biomedicine has grown at a steep rate .
Some might argue that this is the way it should be .
By that cool logic , the nation benefits from having a surplus of scientists who compete against each other for jobs and grants , guaranteeing that the public pays for only truly exceptional work .
There is no doubt that competition can breed excellence , and that agencies should be rigorously selective in their research portfolios .
But beyond a certain point , the hyper - competition for grants , publication and tenure hurts everyone — the individuals involved , the country and science itself .
The process ceases to select for only the very best young scientists , and instead starts to drive many of the smartest students out of research entirely .
They realize that the risks outweigh the benefits in science and choose alternative careers .
Witness the steady migration of top undergraduates to business and other professions in the past decade , and the drop in the number of doctorates in science and engineering earned by US students since it peaked in the mid-1990s .
Those dedicated individuals who do stay in science find that they have less time to do the research they were trained for : a 2007 study by the Federal Demonstration Partnership in Washington DC found that investigators typically spend some 40 % of their working week on grant submittals and other administrative duties .
Bursting the bubble
For researchers struggling in the current environment , we can offer no obvious solutions .
But both the government and universities can do a great deal more to guard against repeating past mistakes .
Most importantly , the country 's leaders should heed the lessons of the NIH funding bubble and commit to long - term , predictable growth in the science budgets , not just a quick infusion of cash that will simply create another bubble ( see page 649 ) .
And agencies should also refine and expand their recent efforts to direct more funding to younger investigators who bring new ideas into science .
At the same time , government and academic officials should look carefully at how the country trains its next crop of researchers and how many it produces — as called for by many top scientists and blue - ribbon panels .
Universities , in particular , should overhaul their doctoral programmes to graduate people faster and prepare them for jobs outside the traditional academic setting .
This is made all the more urgent by the economic downturn .
As in previous recessions , US research institutions are experiencing a flood of new applications for their doctoral programmes in science and engineering ( see page 642 ) .
These students are entering the system at the very time when industry is cutting thousands of jobs for researchers .
Hopefully those positions will reappear by the time the next wave of doctoral students graduate .
A number of resources have emerged in recent years to help young scientists start careers in and outside universities , including alternative - career clubs started by the students themselves .
But these measures alone are not enough ; doctoral programmes should build better career counselling and training into their curricula from the start .
Reform - minded deans have long championed this change but faculty members have resisted , in part because they cling to the archaic prejudice — implicit at times — that students who leave academia are failures .
The failures , however , rest within the scientific leadership , when it focuses only on numbers and fails to see individuals who write the grant proposals , conduct the research and struggle to keep their careers afloat .
Rights and permissions Reprints and Permissions
The popular technology website Slashdot plumbed new depths on Tuesday with a post about the terrible DRM situation in Windows 7 .
Proving that some sites will publish just about anything as long as it's anti-Microsoft , the post enumerated the DRM restrictions that Windows 7 apparently inflicts on the honest and upstanding computer user .
What was claimed ?
Well , some guy decided that he wanted to crack his ( legally purchased , no doubt ) copy of Photoshop on his Windows 7 install .
Windows 7 then sprung into life to break his crack , defend Photoshop 's virtue against his unwelcome advances , protect a load of random DLLs from deletion , and open up the firewall so that Adobe could see that he was up to no good .
Yup yup .
To add insult to injury , Windows 7 then crippled the dude 's sound card .
Or something .
As is so often the case with this kind of story , the truth is more prosaic .
The most likely reason that Photoshop broke is that either the crack did n't work or was the wrong version .
Windows does n't actually know what Photoshop is — it's just another application , no different from any other — and the operating system certainly does n't contain special programming to detect and destroy Photoshop cracks .
Nor , for that matter , did Windows 7 magically open up the firewall .
The Photoshop installer did that .
And it only had permission to do that because the person installing the software gave it Administrator privileges so that it had access to the firewall configuration .
And the audio capabilities ?
They 're largely determined by the sound drivers that are installed .
The ones that ship on - disc are quite limited and do n't offer any of the fancy sound processing or multiple outputs that custom drivers provide , but they do work .
The particular complaint here is that Windows 7 lacks a " Stereo Mix " audio input .
The " Stereo Mix " input allows the output of the sound card to be recorded directly , which is useful for capturing program output .
But the reason there 's no Stereo Mix is that the drivers the complainant was using does n't support them .
Third - party / custom drivers may continue to offer Stereo Mix , What - U - Hear , or any other equivalent ; it 's just the built - in ones that do n't .
They do n't really do much at all , leaving scope for third parties to offer improvements on the base capabilities of the OS .
Windows 7's DRM
The more interesting question here is what DRM does Windows 7 have ?
Considering that Windows 7 is based on Windows Vista , it probably wo n't be altogether surprising to learn that Windows 7's DRM is more or less the same as Vista's .
In practice , the most obvious restrictions — the ones most likely to affect people — are the ones protecting Windows itself : Product Activation and Windows Genuine Advantage .
Neither of these are in any sense new , and in practice the majority of ( legal ) users will barely know that they exist .
Though activation caused a ruckus when XP was launched ( with many fearing that it would all but end their ability to use their PCs in the way they wanted ) , in practice its restrictions have been quite inoffensive .
Vista had its own DRM brouhaha , but this time the concern was not over the DRM protecting the operating system itself , but rather the DRM for protecting copyrighted sound and video .
It 's true that Vista expanded on these capabilities .
The Protected Video Path — designed to provide a secure way of playing back Blu-ray and HD DVD video — was new to Vista .
When PVP is active , drivers must ensure that they keep the video safe .
In particular , this means disabling high - resolution unencrypted outputs lest they be used to dump the decrypted , decoded video .
Particular complaints have been made about the polling that this requires ; digital outputs must be checked every 30ms and analog ones every 150 ms to ensure that no prohibited devices are attached .
Although the system demands from this polling are negligible , it has nonetheless been blamed for Vista 's relatively high system requirements .
On top of PVP , Vista includes a secure audio path called Protected User Mode Audio , or PUMA , which replaces XP 's Secure Audio Path .
The purpose of this is much the same as PVP ; it is there to protect audio from being recorded or otherwise captured .
Though there was plenty of outcry over PUMA and PVP prior to Vista 's launch , the story is once again a familiar one : most people do n't notice .
Little or no media actually demands the use of the protected paths , so on most users ' systems , Windows never invokes them .
Play back unprotected media on a Vista machine and the DRM subsystems simply do n't get used .
All these Vista DRM features are found in Windows 7 .
But just as with Vista before it , the vast majority of users will never see the DRM in any practical sense ; the features are there just in case Hollywood decides to make use of them .
The overblown , unrealistic , and just plain made up horrors of DRM in Windows Vista never came to pass ( in spite of the huge publicity that the Gutmann diatribe received ) , and so it will be with Windows 7 .
When it comes to bashing Microsoft , it seems that any old canard will do ; facts are strictly optional .

An 82 - year - old heavy metal fan from Weobley in Herefordshire has spoken about his longstanding love affair with rock music .
Ben Sidwell reports
This , of course , is a good idea but we all rather thought that Pasquale Pistorio had made , and won , the argument that ‘ every macro- economic region needs controlled access to microelectronics ’ , back in the 1980s .
In 1983 the Mega - Project launched with Siemens and Philips aimed at regaining microelectronics parity with the USA and Japan .
That was followed by the EC - backed and organised JESSI , then MEDEA , MEDEA + and now CATRENE and ENIAC .
What seemed to spoil the party was the 2007 decision of the Crolles 2 participants , Freescale , NXP and ST to trot off to IBM and TSMC for their basic microelectronics technology rather than develop it in France .
Of course Freescale and NXP were n’t entirely to blame , having been taken over at that stage by the Wall Street private equity companies Blackstone and KKR .
But it must have been a bitter blow for the EC authorities to see 20 years of support for the industry chucked in their faces by managements looking to short - term financial considerations as opposed to long - term commitment to European technological independence .
In short , the NXP and Freescale moves were cynical .
Why should the European taxpayer back cynics ?
STMicroelectronics was a different kettle of fish .
Without its Crolles 2 partners it was pretty much obliged to pull out of basic microelectronics R&D at Crolles and follow Freescale to IBM .
And Infineon was never involved in Crolles , either Crolles 1 or 2 .
Now , as SEMI points out , European output of microelectronics is nose - diving – down 25 per cent between 2005 and 2007 .
The industry desperately needs help .
But how do you help people who can so lightly disregard the help they have received in the past ?
Everyone wants NXP and Freescale to survive and thrive .
But no one wants to see their owners Blackstone and KKR receive any benefit from European taxpayers ’ money .
That ’s a heck of a dilemma .
A congressional subcommittee investigating a recent salmonella outbreak released e-mails Wednesday revealing that the owner of a peanut company discounted warnings that nuts were infected with the deadly bacteria .
“ This lot is presumptive SALMONELLA !!!! ” wrote plant worker Mary Wilkerson last June 6 to company officials .
That same day , Stewart Parnell , owner and president of Peanut Corp. of America , replied , “ thanks Mary , I go thru this about once a week ... I will hold my breath ......... again ... ”
The e-mails were released on the same day that the House energy and commerce subcommittee announced that a ninth death , that of an elderly Ohio woman , had been tied to the salmonella outbreak .
The panel also heard testimony from family members of people killed or sickened in the outbreak .
“ Cancer could n’t kill her , but peanut butter did , ” Jeffrey Almer said of his 72 - year - old mother , who died in December .
Almer told the subcommittee that his mother , Shirley , ate tainted peanut butter in a Minnesota rehabilitation center where she was being treated for a urinary tract infection .
The day before she was to return home , he said , doctors unexpectedly said his mother had only hours to live .

The Food and Drug Administration last month traced the source of the outbreak , which has sickened 600 people nationwide , to the company ’s Blakely , Ga. , plant .
The agency found that Peanut Corp. knowingly shipped peanuts , peanut butter and peanut paste products to dozens of food makers even after lab tests detected salmonella at the now - closed plant .
Parnell , the Peanut Corp. owner , refused to answer the subcommittee ’s questions Wednesday , repeatedly invoking his 5th Amendment rights .
Internal company e-mails obtained by the subcommittee show the company ’s president was alerted on numerous occasions to the fact that batches of the company ’s products were infected with salmonella .
Yet according to Parnell ’s e-mail responses , he instructed staff to “ turn the product loose . ”
At the hearing , Parnell said : “ Mr. Chairman and members of the committee , on advice of my counsel , I respectfully decline to answer your questions based on the protections afforded me under the U.S. Constitution . ”

Peanut Corp. plant manager Sammy Lightsey also invoked his right not to testify .
Rep. Greg Walden ( R - Ore. ) held up a gallon bucket wrapped in yellow crime scene tape and presumably containing a recalled peanut butter product , and asked Parnell if he would be willing to “ take the lid off ” and eat any of it .
Parnell again invoked the 5th Amendment and was ushered out of the hearing room along with Lightsey and their counsel .
Before his dismissal , subcommittee Chairman Bart Stupak ( D - Mich . ) asked Parnell , “ The food poisoning of people , is that just a cost of doing business for you ? ”
Lou Tousignant , whose father , Clifford , a highly decorated Korean War veteran with three Purple Hearts , died in a Minnesota nursing home in January after eating salmonella - tainted peanut butter , played a moving video tribute to him that left many in the audience wiping away tears .
Afterward , Tousignant asked how an outbreak of such magnitude could occur , then told the panel , “ Please do your job . ”

Peter Hurley testified that when his 3 - year - old son , Jacob , started experiencing symptoms of salmonella poisoning in early January , the boy turned to the very comfort food that was making him ill : Keebler ’s Austin Toasty Crackers with Peanut Butter .
Oregon state epidemiologist Dr. William Keene collected samples of Jacob ’s stool and of the crackers , and tests found a DNA match with the salmonella strain linked to the outbreak .
The family was immediately notified of the danger , and Jacob is recovering .
Also testifying was Charles Deibel , president of Deibel Laboratories , which tested Peanut Corp. products .
Deibel said his company notified Peanut Corp. that salmonella was found in products from its Georgia plant .
“ What is virtually unheard of is for an entity to disregard those results and place potentially contaminated products into the stream of commerce , ” Deibel said .
Advertisement
Calling product testing the “ last chance to catch a problem , ” Deibel said FDA quality control processes need to be updated and food safety guidelines enhanced to eliminate problems .
Lightsey referred to Deibel in a Sept. 29 , 2008 , e-mail released by the subcommittee : “ We received Final Lab results from Deibel this morning and we have a Positive for Salmonella . ”
He went on to say , in part , that two of Peanut Corp .'s clients “ need to be called and the product placed on HOLD until this can be cleared . ”
On Oct. 6 , 2008 , Parnell replied : “ We need to discuss this .... the time lapses , besides the cost is costing us huge $ $ $ $$ and causing obviously a huge lapse in the time from the time we pick up peanuts until the time we can invoice ... ”
On Jan. 28 , Peanut Corp. issued a voluntary recall of all peanut and peanut butter products processed in the Georgia plant since Jan. 1 , 2007 .

The company is under FBI investigation , and its Lynchburg , Va. , headquarters was raided this week .
Peanut Corp. on Monday closed a second facility after tests indicated the presence of salmonella in samples from its Texas plant .

The Anatomy of Dating a Sugar Daddy Some see relationships with sugar daddies as mutually beneficial .
Jan. 26 , 2009  --
Eighteen - year - old Melanie is living a big city life that might be the envy of any girl her age .
Designer handbags , thousand - dollar shoes and extravagant trips are all at her disposal .
" I am having an amazing time .
I love life , " she said .
" I like life better than the average girl . "
" All my bills paid , travel when I want , go shopping and do things girls my age can't do , " Melanie said of her life 's perks .
But it 's not her part - time modeling gig funding her easy - breezy lifestyle : it 's her 40 - year - old , married millionaire sugar daddy , Chris .
The pair met on a Web site for linking sugar daddies and sugar mamas .
Chris and Melanie now have been dating for a month .
" We 're pretty up - front about what we 're looking for , " Chris said .
" I 'm happy because I have a beautiful girl to hang out with . "
Melanie and Chris said they see their relationship as mutually beneficial .
He pays the rent on her $ 5,000 - a- month New York apartment , and he gets a sexual companion sans " drama . "
" Right now it 's just having fun , " said Chris , who added , " Sex is not the only component here . "
" I want to feel young again , " he said .
Sugar Daddies in Pop Culture
Pop culture has been quick to identify those perceived as sugar daddies and to scrutinize the relationships .
When Anne Nicole Smith landed 89 - year - old J. Howard Marshall in 1994 , many said she found the ultimate sugar daddy .
More recently , reality shows like " The Real Housewives of Atlanta " and " The Real Housewives of Orange County " have documented women with wealthy benefactors banking their extravagant lives , including cars , jewelry , trips and homes .
Now , dozens of sites have popped up online catering to sugar daddies and those who seek them .
Stephan Smith , marketing director of seekingarrangement.com , said his site has more than 300,000 registered users and offers " a generous benefactor to pamper , mentor and take care of you . "
" The stereotype of a sugar daddy has changed , " he said .
No longer is it " a guy with a gold chain and a furry chest . "
" The sugar daddy of today could be the guy in the Starbucks line who has some disposable income at the end of the month to pamper a sugar baby with , " Smith said .
" She 's working hard at a part - time job on the side and she could use a guy who could offer some monetary support . "
Relationship or Prostitution ?
But critics contend sites like Smith 's really are business transactions for men seeking sex .
In a roundtable of women " GMA " assembled on sugar daddies and sugar mamas , some said the women in these relationships essentially are prostitutes or escorts offering sex and companionship for money .
" You are selling yourself if you enter a relationship like that , " said a woman named Abi .
But not everyone agreed with the sentiment .
" This is just like dating — dating with perks , " said a woman named Alicia Dunams , who described herself as a former sugar baby .
" A lot of these men have been married and they do n't want a woman who is going to nag them when they come home . "
Dunams said she would be " completely fine " if her daughter grew up to date a sugar daddy , as long as " he treated her well . "
" She is 100 percent having sexual intercourse with that man .
Escort means usually a nicer word for prostitute , but [ a ] sugar baby is a relationship you 're dating someone but you have a monthly allowance , " Melanie said .
" You make it clear if you want to have sex or you do n't want to have sex . "
Even with her self - described mutually beneficial relationship , Melanie said she hopes to one day find true love — the one thing money can't buy .
" Every girl wants the fairy tale ending , " she said .
Workers perform a quality check for newly made toys at the production line of a toy factory in the suburbs of Shanghai October 31 , 2008 .
According to the owner of the factory , where most of the production is for export to the U.S and Japan , the slowdown of about 30 % in client 's orders can be mainly attributed to the global financial crisis .
The number of Chinese firms exporting toys overseas halved in the first seven months of 2008 , compared to the year before , the General Administration of Customs said on Monday .

Open the Google Embeddable Calendar Helper program by clicking the customize button and choose elements that you want to display or hide in the calendar .
Embed Very Large Photographs
To embed really large images in your blog , you may either use Deep Zoom or the Google Maps viewer .
These programs break your photographs in small tiles and you can even pan / zoom across these images very similar to the default interface of Google Maps .
Embed Charts and Graphs in Web Pages
My personal favorite is Zoho Sheet – any chart created inside Zoho Sheet can be published as an external image without exposing the full spreadsheet .
If you are interested in creating charts with low volume of data , use Google Charts .
Embed GIF Animations and Screencasts
GIF animations ( see example ) are a perfect way to embed short screencasts in web pages as they require no plugins and auto - play inside feed readers .
You should upload GIF files to your Flickr account as it preserve all the frames while lot of other image hosting website will drop anything after the first frame .
Embed Chat in your Blog
If you like to chat with visitors who are currently on your site , get the chat widget from Meebo Me and place it in the sidebar of your website .

Scribd supports both doc and the new Office 2007 docx format in addition to Open Office documents .
Even Barack Obama is using Scribd to upload his public documents and upcoming plan .
Embed PowerPoint Presentations
While the popular choice is Slideshare , you should also consider using Issuu ( best web application ) for presentations that are either large or formatted in the form of magazines or catalogues ( see example ) .
The only downside is that Issuu accepts PDFs so you need to convert the presentation before uploading onto Issuu .
Embed Spreadsheet Data
Both Zoho Sheet and Google Docs allow you to publish a range of cells from a spreadsheet into a web page but the embedding process in Zoho is less complicated - select a range and choose “ Publish ” from the contextual menu to embed that range into your web page .

Embed Another Webpage in your Blog
If you like to embed another website into your web page , your best bet is an IFRAME tag also known as an Inline Frame .
Just set the SRC value to the address of the web page that you want to embed into your current HTML document .
You could try IFRAMEs for inserting live search results from Google into your web page without having to worry about APIs .
Embed Windows Media or QuickTime movies
While it is possible to embed mov or wmv videos in web pages directly using the OBJECT tag , I recommend that you put these videos onto blip.tv and then embed them in web pages as Flash video .
That ’s because your visitors can then play the video without extra plugins and two , they always have the option to download the video in the original format from blip.tv servers .
Embed Other Fonts in Web Pages
Most web pages use universal fonts like Arial , Times New Roman or Verdana since they are installed on most computers and hence your web pages will render correctly .
If you want to try something different and render pages in fonts like Microsoft Calibri or Adobe Garamond Pro that are only available on some machines , all you need is sIFR – it lets you use almost any font for your web pages using JavaScript +
Flash and is perfect for writing “ newspaper style ” headlines .
Embed your Lifestream in a Web Page
You have a presence on YouTube , Flickr , Twitter , Last.fm , Facebook , Amazon and a dozen other online places .

Activists in Portland , Ore. really know how to make a scene in a shopping mall .
[ social_buttons ]
Four women dressed as cheerleaders chanted and danced in front of a pet store known to sell sick puppies from puppy mills yesterday before mall security decided they ’d had enough .
Instead of detaining the cheer leaders , they decided to go after the one male activist who began yelling after the cheering stopped .
The shop in question , Scamp ’s , was recently exposed by a three - month investigation by a local news channel to be selling sick and diseased puppies , a common problem with puppies purchased from mills .
The Radical Cheerleaders for Animal Rights decided to perform in front of a Scamps inside Lloyd Center Mall in Portland .
After they stopped cheering , another activist informed onlookers exactly why the cheerleaders were there .
Security guards proceeded to tackle and detain him , to the disgust of onlooking shoppers who pulled out camera phones and chanted “ The whole world is watching ! ”
Make sure to watch the whole video !

Few headlines are as depressing as those announcing the yet another round of layoffs from yet another struggling company .
On Friday , February 27 , for example , Pilgrim ’s Pride announced it would close three chicken - processing plants , shedding 3,000 jobs .
Alliant Techsystems announced it would cut 300 jobs .
Mastercraft Boats said at least 110 workers would be let go .
In all , I read about 22 companies or government agencies planning to shed employees through Santhi Rudraraju ’s Layoff & Hiring News — 007 app for the iPhone and iPod touch .
The app , which works with Wi -Fi , 3G , or EDGe connection , feeding a steady flow of headlines from the full - featured Layoff Daily Web site .
Layoff ’s simple but drab interface befits these austere times .
The app is not much different from any other garden - variety RSS reader and is fairly easy to navigate .
Tap on a headline , and Layoff will launch a browser window within the app .
It features two days ’ worth of headlines , updated in real time , as well as a section on major corporate layoffs and news of companies that are actually hiring — the latter no doubt being an effort to stave off reader attrition by suicide .
The app can be slow to load headlines — a problem the developer seems to acknowledge with a “ thanks for being patient ” message that appears every time you tap a section on the menu bar at the bottom of the screen .
Bottom line : Layoff & Hiring
News gives you all the bad news you can stomach ( and some good ) in a no-frills package .

Layoff is compatible with any iPhone or iPod touch running the iPhone 2.2 software update .

There are many contenders to the desktop crown , and a relative newcomer in that area is Whitix , an operating system which , despite what the name suggests , is not based on Linux .
It comes with a fully pre-emptive multitasking kernel as well as ports of GCC , Python , and Mono .
A bugfix release has just been posted on the website .
So , what makes Whitix different ?
Why should you try it out ?
Thoughtfully enough , the developers answered that question for us .
New kernel features .
New features , like the information and configuration filesystem , a filesystem that lets system components expose information and configuration data about themselves ( for an Ethernet card , / System / Config / Devices / Network / Ethernet0 / macAddress , or / Devices / Network / Ethernet0 / macAddress using SysConfRead , would be the way to edit and access its MAC address ) .
Other features include a new network stack design that minimizes latency ( netchannels ) and a new thread scheduler .
Clear filesystem layout .
/ bin , /etc and /usr / bin are replaced with / Applications , / System / Registry and other intuitive names ; great for a clear view of the system internals .
This bugfix release fixes several bugs ( really ? ) in the 0.2 release , some of which were rather show - stopping .

BPSDB Today is the mass civil disobedience coinciding with Powershift ’09 in Washington DC. ( live coverage at Capital Climate Action and Greenpeace ) .
The nonviolent resistance and the reasons for it , from the political “ Climate Code Red ” to the personal “ See you in jail :
It ’s not symbolism when you live in D.C. ” ,
Why civil disobedience may be necessary on climate change have been covered , so I wo n’t be repeating that .
I thought I might weigh in from a slightly different perspective , but first my credentials .
I have on more than one occasion had reason to discuss forestry practices and First Nation rights with members of various law enforcement agencies here in Canada .
There is also the rather odd distinction of being thrown out of jail after only a week because they needed room .
More importantly , for many years I have , more or less at random , taught a 12 week course in the “ Politics of Resistance . ”
It is conceptually organized around Gene Sharp ’s three volume “ The Politics of Nonviolent Action ” and Bill Moyer ’s “ Doing Democracy ” and covers everything from the theoretical concepts underlying nonviolent resistance through the practicalities of action , arrest , court , and jail .
Thanks to a friend I was even privileged to help transport and accompany the infamous Teddy Bear Catapult ’ at the 2001 Summit of the America ’s actions in Quebec City .
So been around the block , as it were .
“ Those who profess to love freedom and yet deprecate agitation are men who want crops without ploughing .
This struggle may be a moral one , or it may be physical , but it must be a struggle .
Power concedes nothing without a demand .
It never did .
And it never will . ”
Frederick Douglas
Do I agree with using civil disobedience ( hereafter CD ) as a political method ?
Of course , that ’s why I teach people how to do it .
From the suffragettes , through labour , civil rights , the Indian independance movement etc we only have many of the rights that we do because people were willing to resist .
I believe a real democracy would teach it in schools .
It is a powerful tool that should be part of every activists tool box .
Since it is a powerful tool you can accomplish some pretty amazing things when it is used correctly for the right job .
In the same vein , it can be useless , even very damaging to the individual , group , and cause when used incorrectly or for the wrong purpose .
“ Corbett Bishop , a WWII draft resister , was arrested on Sept 9 , 1944 .
He told the police that the spirit is free and if they wanted his body they would have to take it without his cooperation .
He refused to eat , stand up , or dress himself .
He was force - fed and carried around in the prison and the court .
After 144 days he was suddenly released on probation from his 4 year sentence .
He refused to cooperate with the terms of his probation and was locked up again to serve the rest of the 4 years .
He continued his resistance , and after another 49 days he was released unconditionally . ”
Per Herngren 1993
I blogged before about being uncomfortable with Al Gore calling for CD actions if he was not willing to stand at the barricades as well .
Not necessarily every time , or even today , but at some point .
“ Going to jail , doing civil disobedience , is n’t all that special or threatening .
It ’s just something that has to be done in a world where insanity is legal .
Civil disobedience is a fact of life .
I hope we can learn to accept it gracefully . ”
Shelly Douglas ( from prison )
There is the potential for significant consequences for those involved , and one should not call on others to do what one is unwilling to do oneself .
Martin Luther King Jr , Gandhi etc were not great leaders because they hung back while others took the risks .
So it ’s very heartening to see that recognized leaders such as Bill McKibben “ ” Why I ’m Planning to Get Arrested on Monday ( and You Should , Too ) ” Wendell Berry “ An invitation to illegally occupy a coal power plant from Bill McKibben and Wendell Berry ” and James Hansen “ Is it time for civil disobedience at coal plants ?
Would you get arrested to help save a livable climate ?
Here ’s your chance Monday in DC . ” will be participating , not to mention the endorsement and support from many other prominent people .
“ I do not wish to be here , but if the price of resistance is going to be jail for some of us .
To say yes to life and no to death is going to cost us something . ”
John Bell ( from jail )
If you are contemplating CD ( and every citizen should be ready to do so when the situation calls for it , and our plight certainly does ) , there are many things to know .
Some key ones I would highlight are :
It comes as a surprise to some people that when they commit a crime that carries a potential sentence of , say up to six months in prison , they will conceivably be sentenced to up to six months in prison .
Equally the system can get quite creative in laying charges .
Actions that people believed would amount to no more than trespass or some such misdemeanor turn up as sabotage , aggravated assault , or some other nasty surprise .
“ Any great change must expect opposition , because it strikes at the very foundation of privilege . ”
Lucretia Mott 1853
Often things play out more or less as planned , or at least an acceptable variation of it .
Often , but not always .
Be at least mentally prepared for the unexpected .
So , if you are contemplating CD and have no experience , get training !
Know what you are getting into and what to do once you are in it , from the action itself right through the arrest , court and jail experience .
“ From a political perspective I have never been as effective outside of the walls as I have in prison . ”
Per Herngren ( 1993 , pg 140 )
The other risk is to movement dynamics .
Doing CD brings a lot of powerful emotions into play and it definitely is an emotional high .
There are even people you come to recognize as ‘ CD junkies ’ , as well as people who are simply using the opportunity to play out personal anger issues .
One of the dynamics that invariably comes into play is the entire ‘ violence vs nonviolence ’ non-debate ( very similar to the Denier vs science non-discussions ) and the associated ‘ what is violence ? ’
Hopefully we will have learned from the anti-globalization movement which seemed to have such promise at the WTO Seattle 1999 actions , and yet tore itself apart during and after the 2001 SOA Quebec City , Prague and Genoa protests .
At the time the euphemism was “ diversity of tactics ” , code for vandalism , setting fires , and attacking police with stones , bottles , slingshots , etc .
Many within the movement were unwilling to be associated with this sort of thing , and the public understandably did not accept a movement protesting the violence of globalization while tolerating these sorts of tactics to gain it ’s ends .
An oversimplification to be sure , with many other factors playing a significant roles , particularly 9/11 and an increasing sense of futility .
How could it be otherwise when referring to a movement that spanned years and involved millions of people ?
Even so , the internal dynamics were probably a big reason a movement which really seemed to have the chance to unite global resistance degenerated into little more than Summit hopping and Photo Ops for the leadership .
The intent [ of a trial ] is to get a dialogue going , not to be defended .
Per Herngren ( 1993 , pg 128 )
So let ’s hope today is the dawn of a political movement emulating the discipline and effectiveness of the civil rights movement , having learned from the mistakes of a decade ago .
We have to get this one right the first time , because there wo n’t be any second chances .
“ You do not become a ‘ dissident ’ just because you decide one day to take up this most unusual career .
You are thrown in to it by your personal sense of responsibility , combined with a complex set of external circumstances .
You are cast out of the set of existing structures and placed in a position of conflict with them .
It begins as an attempt to do your work well , and ends up with being branded an enemy of society . ”
Vaclav Havel
We give our consent every moment that we do not resist .

Asciicasts : Railscasts
In Text Form
We 're all familiar with Ryan Bates ' excellent ( award winning even ) Railscasts - the gigantic collection of free screencasts that show you how to pull off daring stunts with Rails ( if you 're not , go check them out , you 're missing a lot ! )
As great as Ryan 's videos are , however , sometimes you might just want to recap what you saw without watching ten minutes of video or , hey , perhaps video just is n't your cup of tea .
Enter ASCIIcasts - Railcasts made into text form .
ASCIIcasts is not by Ryan Bates , however , it 's a project of Eifion Bedford , a British Rails developer .
Initially I thought it was going to be a joke , like an ASCII art video or something , but it 's actually just lucid , textual walkthroughs of what Ryan did in his videos .
So far only 35 are covered , but this is more than enough to get you going with recapping and learning some awesome Rails techniques again .
There are also links on each page to drive you back to the original video for the real deal .

The turtle tank at Nam Hoa Fish Market is empty , but not to worry :
The manager of this bustling Chinatown store says he has plenty in back .
“ Big ones , ” he says , spreading his hands as wide as a Christmas turkey .
He nods to a worker , who slides a large , waxed - cardboard box from a stack behind the counter and strips off the lid .
Inside is a squirming burlap bag , from which he dumps two 15 - pound softshell turtles that hit the concrete with a clop , then flail helplessly on their backs .
“ Miami , ” the shopkeeper says of the reptiles ’ origins .
“ All from Miami . ”

Fresh off a plane at Los Angeles International Airport , one of the hubs of the sprawling international turtle trade , the critters will help feed a huge and growing appetite for freshwater turtles as food and medicine .
The demand pits ancient culture against modern conservation and increasingly threatens turtle populations worldwide .
As Asian economies boomed , more and more people began buying turtle , once a delicacy beyond their budgets .
Driven in particular by Chinese demand , Asian consumption has all but wiped out wild turtle populations not just in China , but in Laos , Vietnam , Cambodia and elsewhere in the region .
Now conservationists fear that the U.S. turtle population could be eaten into extinction .
“ It ’s insatiable , ” says Matt Aresco , a Florida biologist and director of the private Nokuse Plantation conservation reserve in the Florida Panhandle .
“ If we harvested every single turtle in Florida and sent every single one to Asia , there would still be a demand for more , ” he says .
“ That ’s how scary it is . ”
Federal law prohibits the capture of endangered or protected species .
But it does not cover common turtles such as Florida ’s softshells , whose widely varying population estimates range from 4 million to 20 million .
Softshells also abound in other , mostly Southern , states , some of which , including Texas , Oklahoma , Alabama and Mississippi , have banned or severely limited commercial harvests .
Until recently , Florida had no limits on softshell harvests .

In Chinese communities around the world , turtles are coveted for their meat , which is thought to enhance longevity and sexual prowess .
They ’re also used to make tonics believed to boost the immune system , and for other traditional medicines intended to treat an array of ailments , including cancer , arthritis and heart disease .
Carl Chu , the author of “ Finding Chinese Food in Los Angeles , ” recalls growing up in his native Taiwan and watching as turtles ’ heads were cut off and their blood mixed with alcohol , then drunk as an aphrodisiac .
It ’s one small illustration of an age - old Chinese belief that all kinds of food are therapeutic , he says .
“ Anything that can be eaten is eaten to obtain some medicinal effect , and that includes turtles , ” he says .
Helen Nguyen , who has owned Nam Hoa Fish Market for 26 years , says that many of the turtles she sells for $ 6.99 a pound , before butchering , end up as soup in Chinese restaurants in Alhambra and Monterey Park , communities with large Asian populations .

The big , brownish - green softshells are most desirable because a 12 - pounder will yield about half its weight in meat , she says .
Its leathery shell also can be steamed and eaten .
“ Most often , older people eat it , ” Nguyen says .
“ For the body .
For the health .
Makes you healthy . ”
In 1999 , an international consortium of biologists and others estimated that the Asian turtle trade had grown to about 10 million of the reptiles a year , or 30,000 a day .
By many accounts , demand has since grown dramatically .
During the peak season in late summer and early fall , the creatures are pulled by the thousands from Florida lakes , rivers , ponds , canals , drainage ditches and abandoned phosphate pits .

Those who catch them typically use baited hooks on trotlines , some stretching for miles .
Their catch is bagged , boxed and shipped live to U.S. customers on both coasts and the Gulf of Mexico -- and to Asian gateways such as Hong Kong and Taiwan .
One Florida seafood dealer said his company had processed up to 20,000 pounds a week -- a couple of thousand adult turtles .
Another broker ships nearly that much , according to a Florida Fish and Wildlife Conservation Commission report this year .
Many of the shipments go through LAX .
“ In rough numbers , it ’s probably about 800 turtles a week , and they ’re going to southern China and Hong Kong , ” says Joe Ventura , an inspector with the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in Los Angeles .
“ It used to be a luxury item there .
Now it ’s just a routine thing that people eat . ”

Although U.S. turtle farms have multiplied and now raise huge numbers of softshell turtles , almost all are hatchlings , according to Aresco and Kevin Enge , a Florida state biologist .
Hordes are sold to Chinese turtle farms as breeding stock , they say .
In March , Aresco and 33 other turtle experts wrote to Florida ’s wildlife commission , seeking to limit the commercial take to one a day per person .
“ Every boatload of turtles removed from a water body will take years , or even decades , to replace , ” they wrote .
“ Turtles cannot replace themselves like gray squirrels , whitetail deer , or even alligators . ”
Florida Gov. Charlie Crist also has weighed in , calling for a ban on the commercial harvest of softshell turtles .
Advertisement
So too has the Center for Biological Diversity , which argues that current harvest levels are unsustainable .
The Arizona - headquartered group also says many wild turtles are contaminated with mercury , PCBs and pesticides .
Opponents of harvest limits include John Thomas , 75 , whose father founded Thomas Fish Co. in Polk County in 1937 .
He has made his living from central Florida ’s lakes and waterways for more than five decades and says “ there ’s no reason to worry about the turtles . ”
“ We have got 8,000 lakes in this state and they ’ve all got turtles in them , ” says Thomas , one of Florida ’s biggest dealers .
“ We have got hundreds and hundreds of phosphate pits and all kinds of creeks , some of them that run for miles and miles .
And all of them have turtles in them .
They are full of turtles . ”
Thomas , who describes fried turtle as “ somewhere between chicken and frog legs , but with a different taste all its own , ” says that only in the last couple of years has demand for the reptiles been strong enough to make them profitable .
Advertisement
A few years ago , he says , “ nobody bought live turtles , except for the people who put them in their aquariums . ”
Commercial fisherman Leo Gillis , 66 , plies South Florida ’s 730 - square - mile Lake Okeechobee .
“ You can go out there anywhere on the lake and catch a few turtles , ” he says .
“ In the middle , in the grass -- it do n’t make no difference .
And Okeechobee has so many miles of marsh areas where you ca n’t even get to them -- they multiply like all get - out in there . ”
Advertisement
During peak season , Gillis says , he was bringing in “ 400 or 500 bucks a day ” selling live turtles to dealers for $ 1.50 a pound .
Florida ’s wildlife commission in September imposed a temporary , 20 - turtle - a- day limit for commercial fishermen , while it considers a longer - range solution .
Enge , the state biologist , thinks that ’s reasonable .
“ I do n’t think we could extirpate the softshells if we tried , ” he says .
“ Because of the biology of the species and the amount of habitat , I think 20 a day is probably a sustainable harvest forever .
But due to public sentiment and all of that , I would n’t be surprised if that number gets changed . ”
Advertisement
Thomas and the fishermen he buys from say that 20 turtles a day is not enough to be profitable .
Conservationists contend that it is far too many .
Multiplying the daily limit by 150 to 200 licensed commercial fishermen , it works out to a potential harvest of more than 1 million turtles a year .
Aresco says that represents about 27 % of Florida ’s softshells , although state wildlife officials say the population is far larger .
Jeff Miller , a spokesman for the Center for Biological Diversity , predicts demand will only accelerate for what he calls “ these amazing creatures . ”
“ They ’ve been around for hundreds of millions of years and have survived climate change and lots of other things , ” he says .

“ And now we ’re about to eat them out of existence -- in the blink of an eye , biologically speaking . ”

Rove is believed to be the strategic mastermind behind the Bush 2004 re -[s ] - election campaign and the possible Ohio election improprieties .
The alleged threats appear to be the result of the re-opening , through the Ohio Corrupt Practices Act / RICO claim , of the stalled investigation into the 2004 Ohio Elections .
In these difficult times , which unfortunately , or fortunately ( depends on which side of the barricade are you ) began to be felt in all countries , it is easier to not put soul on special edition models , like Vauxhall Astra and Corsa , because they have only some extra hp and a few different elements of design .
Nothing spectacular .
In practice , in a market that is becoming more competitive , these special editions would provide value for money and is also nice to see a producer who is ambitious to make some tuning for their models .
British Company - Vauxhall , a subsidiary of General Motors Corporation ( GM ) and part of GM Europe , introduces special editions such models Corsa and Astra VXR .
Editions in question are intended to celebrate victories achieved last year with Vauxhall BTCC ( British Touring Championship Cup ) , where the British manufacturer has won all three existing titles – from producers , drivers and team .
Inside , Recaro seats are dressed in the leather and Piano Black inserts .
For those interested , there are discounts for buying the Remus exhaust ( which may still provide 20 CP ) and various parts and Vauxhall accessories .
The second edition will be out in 888 copies as a token of recognition for the Triple Eight Engineering who built the team VX Racing Vauxhall cars .
Prices for the editions Corsa and the VX Racing Astra are between 17,425 pounds ( 19,500 euros ) and 21,445 pounds ( 24,000 euros ) .
Hurry to buy it !
With the success of the Apple iPhone , a new surge of development opportunities has arisen in the consumer mobile computing space .
However , due to Apple 's walled garden approach , some developers have been less compelled to spend a lot of time investigating its SDK .
Compounding this closed environment is Apple 's insistence to exclusively base the platform 's programming syntax to be the same as Apple 's desktop OS language of choice , that being Objective - C. While I 've written a few simple applications in Objective - C , the language never really captured my interest , and its inability to reuse the code ( especially the Cocoa GUI - based elements ) on non-Apple platforms further reduced my desire to learn it more deeply .
While Objective - C bindings can be wrapped around scripting languages like Perl , Python and Ruby , the amount of work necessary to wire up cross- platform unfriendly GUI 's is n't worth the effort .
Besides , it does n't appear that Apple will be allowing any other programming languages to reside on their iPhone platform anytime soon .
When Google announced its Linux - based Android platform that hosted applications written using Java syntax , my mobile development interests were quickly realigned to the open platform mantra that Google was chanting .
And yet , even though Google released the Android SDK earlier last year , it was n't until the physical hardware development units became available in December 2008 did I decide to take a more serious look at this alternative mobile OS .
Signing Up
To become a privileged member of the Android Developer Program , you must first visit the Android Market and create a Gmail account if you do n't already have one .
The Gmail account is required for Google Checkout , employed for the one - time $ 25 charge of being granted the permission to post Android applications to the Android Market after agreeing to the lengthy developer agreement .
It is also through this marketplace that developers can purchase a single G1 developer device .
The Hardware Unlike the G1 model currently sold at T - Mobile and other stores , the developer G1 is an unlocked model that permits SIM cards from other carriers besides T - Mobile to be used with the device .
More importantly , this G1 version offers root user access , giving you full access to the Android filesystem as well as the ability to re-flash the device without constraints .
Indeed , adventurous hackers have already created a minimal Debian - based Linux distribution that can be flashed onto the G1 .
This delightful experiment is nowhere near ready for prime time use , but the fact that it can even be done at all will unquestionably motivate other Linux mobile enthusiasts to charge ahead with even more innovative hacks .
Needless to say , the developer unit is n't a device for the technically challenged .
As a mark of special exclusivity , the developer unit G1's rubberized back plate has a custom Android polygon design imprinted across it for additional " Android Club " geek - cred points .
Based on the T - Mobile G1 developed by prolific Windows Mobile hardware designer HTC and modeled upon the HTC Touch , the developer version is everything initial reviews of the consumer G1 said it was : a good first attempt with adequate single touch screen resolution , feature laden with 2G /3G , Bluetooth , GPS and WiFi radios , accelerometer , digital compass and ... an abominable battery life .
Since I have been using the G1 , I have yet to make it through the day without charging it at least twice .
However , barring the fact that this ambitious platform performs miserably in the power consumption category , it nevertheless provides a stable development reference platform to create and test Android applications in the real world .
There were other hardware issues that bothered me enough to have to correct with additional accessory purchases .
First and foremost , the 1 GB microSD card included with the phone is simply too anemic by today 's multimedia standards .
While I debated upgrading to a 16 GB card , I opted for a much less expensive 8 GB capacity instead .
Another truly bone - headed design limitations ( or greedy aftermarket accessory approach , depending on the conspiracy factor ) is the G1's proprietary HTC miniUSB - like adapter that is used for both the unattractive , bulky earbuds as well as the power recharge connection .
Without additional adapters , G1 users cannot , for example , listen to music and charge their device at the same time .
Fortunately , an inexpensive splitter from Amazon ( search for " 2 - in - 1 mini USB adapter " ) solved this annoying dilemma at the expensive of additional bulk clipped to the base of the phone .
Finally , what seems to be a standard omission for most mobile smartphone devices these days is a protective carrying case .
I decided I had invested enough in phone extras and instead simply left the Mylar cover on that protected the screen during shipping .
Incidentally , in keeping with the burgeoning Android OS hacks , a few enterprising Linux netbook hobbyists have succeeded in compiling the Android source targeting an Asus eeePC sub-notebook .
While this certainly generated a buzz in the Android community , using such a device as a G1 replacement is n't practical due to the lack of hardware support such as the sensors and various drivers .
Regardless , the feat further strengthens the reality of Android 's open source platform promise .

Picture the scene .
Youre 8 years old .
You like cars and you like robots .
Its the mid-eighties , your hair is bigger than your dad 's credit card statement and everythings good .
The biggest debate is whether Megatron could kill Darth Vader and you wonder if that kid who says his dad works for a toy company and owns a full size Death - Star is actually telling the truth .
Yes , in these days of iPhone that , Digg this and Credit Crunch the other , it was a simpler time .
Transformers , as you all know , were the best toys of all time and now , fast forward to the dark days of 2009 and theres a glimmer of hope as of last night , Michael Bays trailer for the new Transformers film is released , getting us all excited about the film coming out in June .
Looks pretty cool , does n't it ?
To celebrate this occasion , we went into the loft , cried that our parents had thrown out all of our old toys and then went online to see what the old - school Transformers were really like back in the day and came up with this list , a list of the crappest Transformers and their cars :
9 ) Blurr
Remember Blurr ?
He was the fastest Transformer of them all .
He was blue and spoke in a way that was more annoying than working from home on a snow day .
Check out this picture if you dont believe me on how awful he was .
Words cannot explain the annoyance of this crappy invention .
And , as a toy , his car was rubbish , looking like a load of mints stuck together .
8 ) Astrotrain
This is a toy that your parents loved , firstly it was the toy of two non-violent things :
A train and a space shuttle .
How can you fight with that ?
It was heavy though , so you could possibly hit your brother over the head with it .
Astrotrain reminds me of Nightboat from the Simpsons how could he get anywhere unless there was a railway track ??
Rubbish .
7 ) Soundwave
Another piece of rubbish .
Not a car , and not even able to move under his own steam , so a bit suspect on being on our list , he was a walkman when they were cool .
I guess now hed be an Ipod touch .
Hang on a mo , hes evil isnt he hed probably be a Zune then .
He couldnt even really speak ; only is noteworthy due to his relationship with Megatron .
6 ) Rodimus Prime
He was a red truck - thingie .
He had a lot to live up to , replacing the truck that was Optimus Prime in the original movie ( not the one that came out a couple of years ago , the one that came out in 1986 ) all the fans hated him and his toy was rubbish .
It was like a drumstick on wheels .
Fortunately even the toy makers saw that he was crap and bought Optimus Prime back in charge through a very convoluted method that only children under 10 can tell you about .
5 ) Wreck - Gar
Is it fair to put him on the list of rubbishness ?
He did have the voices of both Eric Idle and Weird Al Yankovic and his whole mantra was to recycle everything .
Well , the end result was that he lived in his own filth and never learnt to read and write properly , which meant he spoke in TV speak , or to put it another way , like Yoda if hed been whacked on the head .
He transformed into a motorbike .
But , could you play with it ?
Nope , as you needed a rider , and that didnt come with it .
Even using Barbie didnt work .
Useless .
4 ) Bumblebee
A pretty effeminate robot and why was he named after an insect when theyd not been on Earth at all ?
He was a Volkswagen Beetle in the old days and a Chevy Camaro in the new film .
They all had one thing in common they were always yellow and always had an unhealthy interest in people , wanting them to be friends and all that .
Why is he rubbish ?
Come on .
Hes a yellow Beetle that wants people to be his friends do I need to say anymore ?!?
3 ) Jazz
I think this was an opportunity , especially in the film to add some ethnicity into the robots .
But Jazz was rubbish , talking like white people think people in the ghetto talk like , he was just annoying .
And quite rightly was killed off .
As a toy car , he was a Porsche 935 which is well cool .
Thats his problem , he was trying to be too cool and ended up being naff .
I cheered when he was torn in two in the film .
2 ) Ultra Magnus
Ohwere getting into the dregs now .
Ultra Mangnus was so rubbish , he wasnt even able to be able to take over the leadership when the driving drumstick was in charge .
As a toy he was a car transporter and it seems that everyone did their very best to get rid of him , but someone loved him and kept him going .
If you got this present for Christmas , you knew your parents hated you .
1 ) Arcee
Come on !
It was a female Transformer called Arcee !
How did that get past everyone ?!
Which writer was having an argument with his imaginary wife / girlfriend to come up with that as a name ?
She was rubbish .
Remember what it was like being 8 ?
Girls had fleas , and the colour pink would burn your skin so why would you wanna play with this pink car ?
Rubbish , rubbish , rubbish .
Any Transformers that we missed out ?
Which ones did you think were rubbish ?

WASHINGTON , Dec. 10 ( UPI ) -- The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency says it 's started the first Web site devoted to apprehending environmental fugitives .
EPA officials said the Web site is designed to enlist the public and other law enforcement agencies in locating people accused of violating environmental laws and evading arrest .

" Putting this information on the EPA 's Web site will increase the number of ' eyes ' looking for environmental fugitives , " said Granta Nakayama , assistant administrator of the EPA 's Office of Enforcement and Compliance Assurance .
" Two EPA fugitives were captured this year , and this Web site could help us find more fugitives in the future . "
The Web site includes photographs of accused people , summaries of their alleged environmental violations and information on each fugitive 's last known whereabouts .
Alleged violations include smuggling of ozone - depleting substances , illegally disposing of hazardous waste and making criminally false statements .
While the FBI , Secret Service and the Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco and Firearms also maintain Web sites featuring fugitives from the law , the EPA said it is the first federal law enforcement agency to feature an environmental crimes fugitive web site .
The Web site is available at http://www.epa.gov/fugitives.
MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - An “ insatiable ” appetite in the United States for illegal drugs is to blame for much of the violence ripping through Mexico , U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton said on Wednesday .
Clinton acknowledged the U.S. role in Mexico ’s vicious drug war as she arrived in Mexico for a two - day visit where she discussed U.S. plans to ramp up security on the border with President Felipe Calderon .
A surge in drug gang killings to 6,300 last year and fears the violence could seep over the border has put Mexico ’s drug war high on President Barack Obama ’s agenda , after years of Mexico feeling that Washington was neglecting a joint problem .
“ Our insatiable demand for illegal drugs fuels the drug trade .
Our inability to prevent weapons from being illegally smuggled across the border to arm these criminals causes the death of police officers , soldiers and civilians , ” Clinton told reporters during her flight to Mexico City .
“ I feel very strongly we have a co-responsibility . ”
Clinton said the Obama administration strongly backed Mexico in its fight with the drug cartels and vowed the United States would try to speed up the transfer of drug - fighting equipment promised under a 2007 agreement .
“ We will stand shoulder - to - shoulder with you ...
Our relationship is far greater than any threat , ” Clinton said at a news conference in Mexico City .
Crushing the drug cartels , who arm themselves with smuggled U.S. weapons and leave slain rivals , sometimes beheaded , in public streets , has become the biggest test of Calderon ’s presidency as the bloodshed rattles investors and tourists .
Washington plans to ramp up border security with a $ 184 million program to add 360 security agents to border posts and step up searches for smuggled drugs , guns and cash .
The Obama administration will spend $ 725 million to modernize border crossings and provide about $ 80 million to help Mexico purchase Black Hawk helicopters , Clinton said .
It was unclear whether this would be new money from the United States or whether the Obama administration had already requested the funds from Congress .
In Washington , Senator Joseph Lieberman said Obama ’s plans were not enough and he would seek $ 385 million more from Congress to pay for 1,600 more Customs and Border Patrol agents and bolster law enforcement centers in border areas .
“ The danger here is clear and present .
It threatens to get worse , ” Lieberman said .

CHALLENGES
Clinton will use her visit to address a trucking dispute with Mexico and long - running trade and immigration issues .
She said the trading partners were making headway on a spat which saw Mexico slam high tariffs on an estimated $ 2.4 billion worth of U.S. goods after the U.S. Congress ended a pilot program to let Mexican trucks operate in the United States .
“ On the trucking dispute , we are working to try to resolve it .
We are making progress , ” she said , adding that she expects Congress will be receptive to the administration ’s ideas .
Clinton , whose includes a stop in the northern business city of Monterrey on Thursday , said the thorny issues on the table did not mean that U.S. - Mexico relations were in trouble .
“ I do n’t see it that way , ” she said .
“ I think that we have some specific challenges ... but every relationship has challenges in it . ”
Mexico has felt slighted by a delay in the arrival of drug - fighting equipment pledged by former President George W. Bush , as U.S. officials have sought assurances that the aid would not end up in the hands of corrupt officials or police .
The U.S. Congress this month trimmed the amount of drug aid money it will set aside this fiscal year to $ 300 million from $ 400 million last year , under a pledge of $ 1.4 billion to Mexico and Central America over three years .
Since taking office in December 2006 , Calderon has spent more than $ 6.4 billion on his drug war and sent 45,000 troops and federal police to trouble spots around the country .
Mexico has repeatedly said , however , that its efforts will come to nothing if the United States does not clamp down on the smuggling of U.S. guns used in 90 percent of drug crimes south of the border .
Clinton described the violence Mexico is grappling with as “ horrendous ” and said cartels were alarmingly well equipped .
“ It ’s not only guns .
It ’s night vision goggles .
It ’s body armor .
These criminals are outgunning the law enforcement officials , ” she said .
“ When you go into a gun fight , where you are trying to round up bad guys and they have ... military style equipment that is much better than yours , you start out at a disadvantage . ”

Hughes 's original formulation of arrows used a point - free style , which is convenient for calculating general properties , but cumbersome for specific definitions .
[ Pat01 ] proposes to extend Haskell so that arrows are almost as convenient to describe as monadic computations .
The new forms are defined by translation back to standard Haskell .
Here 's a simple example to illustrate the notation :
addA :: Arrow a => a b Int -> a b Int -> a b
Int addA f g = proc x -> do y <- f -< x z <- g -< x returnA -< y + z
First , note that there are two new keywords :
proc ( arrow abstraction ) is a kind of lambda , except that it constructs an arrow instead of a function .
-< ( arrow application ) feeds the value of an expression into an arrow .
If you think of proc as lambda and -< as application , the above looks very much like the do - notation for monads .
Bear in mind however that behind the notation lie the more general arrows , as can be seen in the Haskell translation :
addA f g = arr ( \ x -> ( x , x ) ) >>> first f >>> arr ( \ ( y , x ) -> ( x , y ) ) >>> first g >>> arr ( \ ( z , y ) -> y + z )
Of course in this particular case a much more concise translation is possible :
addA f g = f &&& g >>> arr ( \ ( y , z ) -> y + z )
but the preprocessor is n't that smart .
Some more examples :
The last two examples use more fancy definitions from the experimental arrow library ( see the download page ) .
Here are the translation rules used .
( The old version was a little lighter , but less powerful . )
Implementation
There is a preprocessor that reads as input a Haskell script augmented with arrow notation , and outputs a plain Haskell script .
( See the download page . )
It does n't handle literate scripts , but a wrapper script is included , which runs them through the appropriate filter first .
The program is an extension of hsparser , by Sven Panne , Simon Marlow and Noel Winstanley .
( The original hsparser , with bug fixes , is now in the haskell - src package of the Haskell hierarchical libraries . )
The preprocessor does no checking , so if you make an error you 'll get a rather obscure message from the compiler / interpreter when it reads the output .
The notation is also implemented directly in GHC , from version 6.2 , where it is enabled by the - farrows option .
Error reports for arrow notation are considerably clearer , and refer to the original source .
The documentation accompanying GHC has more details .
Bugs and Limitations
General limitations :
Patterns that could fail are n't yet handled as specified , partly because the preprocessor currently does n't have access to all imported modules to figure out whether constructors are unique .
( And maybe the specified treatment is n't such a great idea anyway . )
John Hughes 's suggestion for top - level definitions is n't implemented yet .
The rest relate to the preprocessor , not the GHC implementation .
As part of the ongoing battle among PC makers to out - green each other , Dell says it will now take your unwanted gadgets off your hands and give you something for the privilege .
Most of us are familiar with the concept of trade - ins in some form – cars , mainly – but under the program launched today , the company will exchange Dell gift cards for your e-junk .
Dell Exchange covers all sorts of products , from phones to cameras to PCs to media players .
It ’s partner in the program , Dealtree , will refurbish and resell the gear it can , and items with no trade - in value can be recycled for free .
The program is similar to services already offered by third - party sites such as Gazelle , which pay you in cash .
A 2 - minute test drive of the new Dell program turned up predictable results .
An 80 GB iPod classic in good shape could land you a $ 116 gift card from Dell — but a rickety and slow 5 - year - old laptop will get you little more than an exceptionally clean conscience .
Dell has been very aggressive in pursuing its stated goal to become the greenest IT company around , vying with arch rivals Hewlett - Packard and Apple for the mantle of most eco-conscious .
As part of its announcement , Dell also said it ’s expanding its electronics recycling partnership with Goodwill , bringing the total number of participating stores to more than 1,000 .
According to the EPA , in 2007 , only 18 percent of the 2.25 million tons of TVs , cell phones and computer products tossed out was collected for recycling .

At least 10 people have been killed after Brazilian police raided shanty towns in Rio de Janeiro in an anti-drugs operation .
About 300 police and special forces using armoured vehicles and helicopters descended upon four slums , know as favelas , in the west of the city .
Police say all those who died were suspected drug dealers .
But a BBC correspondent in the city says community groups often challenge the police version of events .
The operation comes as officials recently launched a new approach to ridding the favelas of drugs traffickers .
Instead of withdrawing after violent shootouts , police aim to maintain a constant presence in the shanty towns .
Drugs targeted
Police said the target of the latest operation had been drugs , arms and stolen cars in the sprawling favelas .
Those killed included two teenage boys , the city 's civil defence ministry confirmed .
At least seven people were arrested and police say they recovered guns , two grenades and an assortment of drugs .
A woman who was hit by a stray bullet was also taken to hospital , reports say .
" It was a success .
With today 's operation we have considerably weakened the criminals , " said the head of civil police , Gilberto Ribeiro .
Police often stay out of Rio's large shanty towns , only entering on heavily armed raids directed against drug gangs or illegal militias , says the BBC's Gary Duffy in Rio de Janeiro .
However a new approach to policing is being tried in two poor neighbourhoods , one of which was visited by Brazil 's President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva on Tuesday .
Police are maintaining a 24 - hour presence in the shanty town of Santa Marta to try to reclaim the area from drugs gangs .
Analysts say the experiment might offer at least a limited alternative for policing in city .
However there are more than 900 shanty towns and the costs and challenges of ensuring all are properly policed would be enormous , our correspondent says .
An emergency " Plan B " using the latest technology is needed to save the world from dangerous climate change , according to a poll of leading scientists carried out by The Independent .
The collective international failure to curb the growing emissions of carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) in the atmosphere has meant that an alternative to merely curbing emissions may become necessary .
The plan would involve highly controversial proposals to lower global temperatures artificially through daringly ambitious schemes that either reduce sunlight levels by man-made means or take CO2 out of the air .
This " geoengineering " approach – including schemes such as fertilising the oceans with iron to stimulate algal blooms – would have been dismissed as a distraction a few years ago but is now being seen by the majority of scientists we surveyed as a viable emergency backup plan that could save the planet from the worst effects of climate change , at least until deep cuts are made in CO2 emissions .
What has worried many of the experts , who include recognised authorities from the world 's leading universities and research institutes , as well as a Nobel Laureate , is the failure to curb global greenhouse gas emissions through international agreements , namely the Kyoto Treaty , and recent studies indicating that the Earth 's natural carbon " sinks " are becoming less efficient at absorbing man-made CO2 from the atmosphere .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
Levels of CO2 have continued to increase during the past decade since the treaty was agreed and they are now rising faster than even the worst - case scenarios from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change , a United Nations body .
In the meantime the natural absorption of CO2 by the world 's forests and oceans has decreased significantly .
Most of the scientists we polled agreed that the failure to curb emissions of CO2 , which are increasing at a rate of 1 per cent a year , has created the need for an emergency " plan B " involving research , development and possible implementation of a worldwide geoengineering strategy .
Just over half – 54 per cent – of the 80 international specialists in climate science who took part in our survey agreed that the situation is now so dire that we need a backup plan that involves the artificial manipulation of the global climate to counter the effects of man-made emissions of greenhouse gases .
About 35 per cent of respondents disagreed with the need for a " plan B " , arguing that it would distract from the main objective of cutting CO2 emissions , with the remaining 11 per cent saying that they did not know whether a geoengineering strategy is needed or not .
Almost everyone who thought that geoengineering should be studied as a possible plan B said that it must not be seen as an alternative to international agreements on cutting carbon emissions but something that runs in parallel to binding treaties in case climate change runs out of control and there an urgent need to cool the planet quickly .
Geoengineering was dismissed as a distraction a few years ago but it has recently become a serious topic of research .
Next summer , for example , the Royal Society , in London , is due to publish a report on the subject , led by Professor John Shepherd of the National Oceanography Centre at Southampton University .
Professor Shepherd was one of the scientists who said that a plan B was needed because he was now less optimistic about the prospects of curbing CO2 levels since Kyoto was agreed , and less optimistic about the ability of the Earth 's climate system to cope with the expected CO2 increases .
" Geoengineering options ... must not be allowed to detract from efforts to reduce CO2 emissions directly , " said Professor Shepherd , who studies the interaction between the climate and oceans .
In answer to the question of whether scientists were more optimistic or less optimistic about the ability of the climate system to cope with increases in man-made CO2 without dangerous climate change , just one out of the 80 respondents to our survey was more optimistic , 72 per cent were less optimistic , and 23 per cent felt about the same .
Professor James Lovelock , a geo- scientist and author of the Gaia hypothesis , in which the Earth is a quasi- living organism , is one of those who is less optimistic .
He believes that a plan B is urgently needed .
" I never thought that the Kyoto agreement would lead to any useful cut back in greenhouse gas emissions so I am neither more nor less optimistic now about prospect of curbing CO2 compared to 10 years ago .
I am , however , less optimistic now about the ability of the Earth 's climate system to cope with expected increases in atmospheric carbon levels compared with 10 years ago , " he told The Independent .
" I strongly agree that we now need a ' plan B ' where a geoengineering strategy is drawn up in parallel with other measures to curb CO2 emissions . "
Among those who oppose geoengineering is Professor David Archer , a geophysicist at Chicago University and expert on ocean chemistry .
" Carbon dioxide released to the atmosphere will continue to affect climate for many millennia , " he said .
" Relying on geoengineering schemes such as sulphate aerosols would be analogous to putting the planet on life support .
If future humanity failed to pay its ' climate bill ' – a bill that we left them , thank you very much – they would bear the full brunt of climate change within a very short time . "
Gummer set for green role
The former Tory cabinet member who publicly fed his daughter a beefburger during the outbreak of so - called " mad cow disease " is in line for a leading role in helping the Government fight against global warming , writes Nigel Morris .
John Gummer , who served as Environment Secretary in the previous Conservative government , has been shortlisted for the post of chairman of the Committee on Climate Change .
He is one of three candidates being discussed in Whitehall to succeed Baron Turner of Ecchinswell .
The others are Rachel Lomax , a former Treasury official who has recently retired as a deputy governor of the Bank of England , and Sir John Harman , former chairman of the Environment Agency .
Mr Gummer , 69 , has been a Conservative activist for almost half a century and has spent 34 years as an MP .
He represents the safe seat of Suffolk Coastal .
A 16 - year spell in government culminated with his promotion by John Major to Environment Secretary , when he was regarded as a pioneering minister , introducing the landfill tax and the fuel - price escalator .
Mr Gummer said last night he knew nothing about the vacant post .
Fixing the planet Could technology help save the world ?
Injecting the air with particles to reflect sunlight
Volcanic eruptions release huge amounts of sulphate particles into the upper atmosphere , where they reflect sunlight .
After Mount Pinatubo erupted in 1991 , sulphates reflected enough sunlight to cool the Earth by 0.5C for a year or two .
The Nobel Laureate Paul Crutzen suggested in 2006 that it may be possible to inject artificial sulphate particles into the upper atmosphere – the stratosphere .
However , the idea does not address ocean acidification caused by rising CO2 levels .
There may be side - effects such as acid rain and adverse effects on agriculture .
Creating low clouds over the oceans
Another variation on the theme of increasing the Earth 's albedo , or reflectivity to sunlight , is to pump water vapour into the air to stimulate cloud formation over the sea .
John Latham of the United States National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Boulder , Colorado is working with Stephen Salter of Edinburgh University and Mike Smith at Leeds to atomise seawater to produce tiny droplets to form low - level maritime clouds that cover part of the oceanic surface .
The only raw material is seawater and the process can be quickly turned off .
The cloud cover would only affect the oceans , but still lower global temperatures .
Fertilising the sea with iron filings
This idea arises from the fact that the limiting factor in the multiplication of phytoplankton – tiny marine plants – is the lack of iron salts in the sea .
When scientists add iron to " dead " areas of the sea , the result is a phytoplankton bloom which absorbs CO2 .
The hope is that carbon taken up by the microscopic plants will sink to deep layers of the ocean , and be taken out of circulation .
Experiments support the idea , but blooms may be eaten by animals so carbon returns to the atmosphere as CO2 .
Mixing the deep water of the ocean
The Earth scientist James Lovelock , working with Chris Rapley of the Science Museum in London , devised a plan to put giant tubes into the seas to take surface water rich in dissolved CO2 to lower depths where it will not surface .
The idea is to take CO2 out of the short - term carbon cycle , cutting the gas in the atmosphere .
Critics say it may bring carbon locked away in the deep ocean to the surface .
Giant mirrors in space
Some scientists suggest it would be possible to deflect sunlight with a giant mirror or a fleet of small mirrors between the Earth and the Sun .
The scheme would be costly and prompt debate over who controls it .
Many scientists see it as contrary to the idea of working with the Earth 's systems .
Update : A military judge on Wednesday ( January 21 ) granted the prosecution 's request to halt proceedings against Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and his four alleged co-conspirators for 120 days .
( Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , January 21 , 2009 ) - President Barack Obama acted swiftly and expeditiously by calling for a halt to the unfair military commission proceedings at Guantanamo , Human Rights Watch said today .
Human Rights
Watch said that the order , which Obama issued within hours of taking office , underscored the urgency of the decision to stop the commissions from holding further proceedings .
The order directed military commission prosecutors to seek a 120 - day suspension of all pending cases .
" President Obama knew better than to start his presidency with the spectacle of unfair and chaotic military commission proceedings , " said Joanne Mariner , Terrorism and Counterterrorism Program director at Human Rights Watch .
" The 120 - day halt should give the new administration a reasonable time to throw out those cases without merit and transfer the rest to federal court . "
In a motion filed late on Tuesday night , January 20 , in cases against 9/11 suspects and Omar Khadr , among others , prosecutors requested a 120 - day suspension in the military commission proceedings " in the interests of justice . "
The motion states that it was filed at the direction of the president of the United States and the secretary of defense .
The motion also states that it was filed , " [ i ] n order to permit the newly inaugurated President and his Administration time to review the military commissions process , generally , and the cases currently pending before military commissions , specifically . "
This morning , the military judge in the Khadr case granted the prosecution request for a halt .
The motion was still pending in the 9/11 case .
While the military judges hearing the military commission cases could potentially deny these motions , it is unlikely that they would choose to prolong the proceedings in opposition to the clearly expressed wishes of the new commander - in - chief .
The prosecutors ' motion explains that the order to request a halt in proceeding was made so that the administration could have sufficient time , " to evaluate the cases of detainees not approved for release or transfer to determine whether prosecution may be warranted for any offenses those detainees may have committed , and to determine which forum best suits any future prosecution . "
Human Rights
Watch said that the wording of the motion suggests that the new administration is assessing the possibility of discontinuing certain cases and of transferring other cases to a forum such as federal court .
Depending on the facts in the case , either of these options is appropriate , Human Rights Watch said .
Prior to the issuance of the presidential order , pretrial hearings were held this week in the cases of the 9/11 suspects and Khadr , a Canadian national who was apprehended in Afghanistan at the age of 15 for his role in a firefight that resulted in the death of a US soldier .
The January 19 hearing in the 9/11 case became entangled in complex legal issues involving the use of classified information documenting abusive government conduct .
" The confusion and uncertainty that we repeatedly witnessed at Guantanamo reflects the ad hoc nature of these military commission proceedings , " Mariner said .
" It would be a terrible mistake to try a case as important as the September 11 prosecution in such a crude and untested system . "
Hearings were scheduled for Wednesday , January 21 , in both the 9/11 and Khadr cases .
In the Khadr case , which was scheduled to go to trial on January 26 , the military judge indicated yesterday that the trial would be postponed .
Human Rights
Watch observers are attending both proceedings .
Ehud Tenenbaum , an Israeli hacker arrested in Canada last year for allegedly stealing about $ 1.5 million from Canadian banks , also allegedly hacked two U.S. banks , a credit and debit card distribution company and a payment processor in what U.S. authorities are calling a global " cashout " conspiracy .
The U.S. hacks have resulted in at least $ 10 million in losses , according to court records obtained by Threat Level , and are just part of a larger international conspiracy to hack financial institutions in the United States and abroad .
The broadened case highlights the continued vulnerability of U.S. financial networks to cybercrime , despite supposedly tight industry security standards .
It comes on the heels of other multimillion - dollar heists that also breached the security protecting ATM codes and account information .
In late 2007 , criminals used four hacked iWire payroll cards to steal $ 5 million from ATMs around the world in just two days .
Shortly thereafter , a processing server that handles withdrawals from Citibank - branded ATMs at 7 - Eleven convenience stores was cracked , leading crooks to converge on New York to withdraw at least $ 2 million from Citibank accounts using the stolen ATM data .
And a carefully coordinated global heist last November resulted in a one - day haul of $ 9 million in cash , following a breach at payment processor RBS WorldPay .
Tenenbaum , 29 , made headlines a decade ago under his hacker handle " The Analyzer " for penetrating Pentagon computers and other networks .
He 'd been living in France , and had only been in Canada about five months on a six - month visitor 's permit when he was arrested last August in Calgary with three alleged accomplices for allegedly hacking into Direct Cash Management , a Calgary company that distributes prepaid debit and credit cards .
A Canadian court granted him CDN $ 30,000 bail , but before he could be released from jail , U.S. authorities swooped in with a provisional warrant to retain him in custody while they pursued an indictment and extradition .
" I think he 's probably been getting away with stuff for 10 years , " said Darren Hafner , an acting detective with the Calgary police who investigated Tenenbaum on the Canadian charges .
" We have n't seen or heard from him since the Pentagon attack .
But these guys tend to get this ' cops can't touch me attitude ' and then they get sloppy like any criminal in any type of crime . "
Documents in the U.S. case have been sealed , but Threat Level obtained an affidavit detailing the U.S. allegations filed with the Canadian court handling Tenenbaum 's extradition case .
The affidavit ( .pdf ) was signed by Hafner and provides insight into the wave of multimillion - dollar hacks that have hit a number of financial institutions in the last year as well as the trail of clues left behind by at least one of the alleged hackers .
According to the affidavit , in October 2007 , the United States Secret Service began investigating " an international conspiracy " to hack into computer networks of U.S. financial institutions and other businesses .
As part of that investigation , agents examined network intrusions that occurred in January and February 2008 at OmniAmerican Credit Union , based in Fort Worth , Texas , and Global Cash Card of Irvine , California , a distributor of prepaid debit cards used primarily for payroll payments .
In both cases , the attacker gained access using a SQL injection attack that exploited a vulnerability in the company 's database software .
The attacker grabbed credit and debit card numbers that were then used by thieves in several countries to withdraw more than $ 1 million from ATMs .
In April and May 2008 , agents investigated two additional hacks at 1st Source Bank in Indiana , and at Symmetrex , a prepaid debit card processor based in Florida .
The intruder again used a SQL injection attack , and losses added up to more than $ 3 million .
Investigators traced the intrusions to several servers belonging to HopOne Internet in McLean , Virginia , which turned out to be just a routing point for an attack that originated from servers at the Dutch web hosting company LeaseWeb — one of the largest hosting companies in Europe .
On April 7 , 2008 , the U.S. asked Dutch law - enforcement agents to track " all computer traffic pertaining to three servers hosted by LeaseWeb " and intercept " the content of that traffic " for 30 days , according to the affidavit .
The interception request was renewed for another 30 days on May 9 .
Among the wiretapped traffic , authorities found communications that allegedly occurred between Tenenbaum — using the e-mail address Analyzer22@hotmail.com — and other known hackers discussing the breaches into the four U.S. institutions " as well as many other U.S. and foreign financial institutions . "
In one instant message chat in April 2008 , Tenenbaum allegedly discussed trying to hack into Global Cash Card after system administrators at the company apparently locked him out from an initial intrusion .
" Yesterday I rechecked [ Global Cash Card ] .
They are still blocking everything , " he allegedly wrote .
" So we can't hack them again . "
On April 18 , 2008 , authorities say Tenenbaum gave a co-conspirator the compromised debit and credit card account numbers of more than 150 accounts taken from Symmetrex as well as the computer commands he 'd used to execute the attack .
Then , throughout the night of April 20 , he received updates from accomplices in Russia and Turkey as they successfully withdrew cash from ATMs , and from Pakistan and Italy where the cards apparently failed to work .
The next day , more cards were used in Bulgaria , Canada , Germany , Sweden and the United States .
By late afternoon that day , Tenenbaum told an accomplice he 'd racked up about " 350 - 400 " in earnings .
The affidavit notes that this likely referred to 350,000 to 400,000 dollars or euros .
In an April 20 chat , Tenenbaum allegedly gave an accomplice additional cards , and asked the accomplice to find a " casher " — the underground 's term for the low - level worker whose only job is to withdraw the loot .
" I am making a small operation , you have casher ? " he allegedly wrote .
" I been trying to get a hold of you .
I saved for you 25 cards , each one $ 1,500 limit .
Get casher as soon as possible .
Ok , I will load them . "
According to authorities , after Tenenbaum got into the 1st Source Bank network , he obtained administrator privileges that allowed him to view credit card numbers and ATM output .
This latter activity apparently collided with other hackers who were in the system trying to execute shell commands .
" Is HUGE , " he allegedly wrote an accomplice .
" I saw ATM outputs , tons of cards .
I am admin there , and I already cracked some of the domain . "
His accomplice replied that there were already people inside the network and asked Tenenbaum to get out .
Tenenbaum replied , " Dude , like I told ya .
It 's [ Microsoft ]
Windows network .
I am happy I could help you to get shell there .
Now it 's your guys ' job . "
About a month later , Tenenbaum allegedly disclosed that he'd hacked Alpha Bank in Greece , the country 's second largest commercial bank , where he said friends of his worked .
Despite Tenenbaum 's earlier notoriety as " The Analyzer , " he apparently made no attempt to hide his real identity , using an e-mail address with a name that was previously tied to him , as well as an IP address that was easily connected to him .
" He 's a really intelligent guy , but I think he 's just got this cocky attitude that ' no one can get me , ' " Hafner told Threat Level .
As a result , he says , Tenenbaum made a lot of telling missteps .
According to the affidavit , the subscriber information for the Hotmail account that was used to discuss the hacks was registered under Tenenbaum 's real name and birth date .
Hafner also told Threat Level that Tenenbaum was caught on an ATM surveillance camera withdrawing funds from one of the compromised Canadian accounts .
Tenenbaum was director of a computer security company that he ran out of Montreal called Internet Labs Secure .
U.S. authorities found that someone using an IP address registered to his company accessed the Hotmail account , and also used it to access the Global Cash Card network to check the balances of compromised cards and attempt to increase the limits on the accounts .
Someone used a second IP address associated with Tenenbaum to access Global Cash Card and " download a file containing all of that compromised computer 's data , " according to the affidavit .
Global Cash Card did not respond to calls for comment from Threat Level .
A spokesman for Symmetrex , which was owned at the time of the hack by Britain - based Altair Financial Services , had no knowledge of the breach , but said Symmetrex processes about 500,000 debit transactions a month for prepaid payroll and gift cards and claimed the company was compliant with the PCI security standards that financial institutions say protect them from such intrusions .
It 's not known if either company notified customers whose information was breached .
There does not appear to be any public announcement about either intrusion .
Symmetrex is the third card - processing company known to have been hacked within the course of a year .
Last December , RBS Worldpay , a U.S. payment processing division owned by the Royal Bank of Scotland , announced that it had been hacked in November , and that information on 1.5 million cardholders was compromised .
Earlier this year , Heartland Payment Systems announced that it also had been hacked some time last year .
Heartland has never released numbers indicating the number of cards compromised in its breach .
The company claimed that it was also PCI - compliant at the time of its breach .
The other two institutions Tenenbaum allegedly hacked last year did warn customers their information was breached .
OmniAmerican told customers in January 2008 that an international gang of cyber criminals hacked its network and stole scores of account numbers .
The intruders modified PINs for the accounts and passed them to accomplices who withdrew cash from ATMs in Russia , Ukraine and elsewhere .
According to letters ( .pdf ) it sent customers and the New Hampshire attorney general , the company discovered fraudulent account activity on Jan. 18 , 2008 and notified customers six days later .
According to a news story the bank reissued some 40,000 debit cards .
The chief security officer at McAfee characterized the hack as sophisticated and the work of an " elite " hacker , " not a kid . "
Similarly on May 29 , 2008 , 1st Source Bank sent a letter to Maine 's attorney general disclosing that it discovered a network security breach on May 12 .
According to the letter , the intruder gained access to debit card information ( .pdf ) and to a database containing the name , address , date of birth and Social Security Number of account holders .
The affidavit detailing the charges against Tenenbaum says investigators have attributed $ 10 million in losses to the hacking spree , though it attributes only $ 1 million in losses to the OmniAmerican and Global Cash Card hacks , and $ 3 million to the 1st Source Bank and Symmetrex hacks .
It 's not clear where the remaining $ 6 million in alleged losses come from , and the U.S. Attorney 's office in the Eastern District of New York , where Tenenbaum is being charged , was unable to account for the discrepancy in the totals .
Tenenbaum 's attorney in Canada did not respond to calls for comment .

Scientists have forged a promising avenue in the quest to restore mobility to patients paralyzed by disease or injury .
Researchers at the University of Washington devised a way to reroute signals from the brain ’s motor cortex to trigger hand movement directly .
For the past decade researchers have focused on “ listening to ” and decod­ing the specific brain signals that trigger muscle movement , using a wall of com­puters running complex algorithms to trans­late that brain activity into instruc­tions for moving a computer cursor or a robotic arm or leg .
The new approach simplifies the process .
Engineers and neuroscientists restored use of a monkey ’s immobilized limb by replacing the lost biological connection .
“ Rather than decoding intention , we ’ve just established a connection and encouraged the monkey to learn how to act on it , ” says Chet Moritz , a neurophysiologist , who pioneered the work with fellow Washington professor Eberhard Fetz .
They trained macaques to play a simple video game using a joystick .
Then they ran a wire from a single neuron in the animals ’ motor cortex to a desktop computer .
The electrical impulse from that cell was amplified by the computer and transmitted along another wire to one of the primates ’ arm muscles , which had been temporarily anesthetized .
Within minutes , the monkeys learned to control wrist movements with their thoughts , moving the joystick left or right to match targets on a computer screen .
The surprise , Moritz says , was that any neuron within that general region of the brain could learn to stimulate wrist muscles — regardless of whether the neuron was originally involved in that specific movement .
“ Monkeys can rapidly learn to change neuron activity , in this case to generate movement , much like humans can change heart rate activity with bio­feedback , ” Fetz explains .
This control necessitated conscious attention ; making such movements subconsciously would require repetitive training , much like learning a sport .
The long - term goal is to develop a miniaturized , implantable neuro­prosthetic device that would enable paralyzed patients to move their own paralyzed limbs .
Fetz has already taken the next step , developing a cell phone–size neurochip that can be linked to a microprocessor , small enough for mon­keys to carry implanted in their head .
Many hurdles remain .
It is difficult to record from the same neuron for a long period .
Within days or weeks , scar tissue walls off electrodes , interrupting transmission .
Guiding electrodes to new locations with tiny motors might mitigate that problem .
Providing a decades - long power supply is also a challenge .
Biocompatibility is another issue ; fully implanting such a system under the skin presents a huge infection risk .
And crucial questions exist :
Can this model be scaled up to stimulate multiple neurons that trigger multiple muscles ?
How flexible is the brain in reassigning new functions to neurons ?
The team hopes to restore arm movements in the near term — and ultimately to restore paraplegics ’ ability to walk .
But clinical trials remain perhaps a decade away .

New Berlin - Describing a pattern of manipulation and deception using the social networking site Facebook , the Waukesha County district attorney today announced sexual assault charges against a New Berlin Eisenhower student who authorities say coerced male students into sexual encounters .
Anthony R. Stancl , 18 , posing as a female on Facebook , persuaded at least 31 boys to send him naked pictures and then blackmailed some of the boys into performing sex acts under the threat that the pictures would be released to the rest of the high school , authorities say .
All 31 boys attend New Berlin Eisenhower High School .
The sexual assaults occurred in the high school bathroom , the high school parking lot , the public library restroom , Valley View Park , Malone Park and at some of the victims ' homes , authorities say .
At least seven boys were forced into performing sex acts .
The 31 males range in age 13 to 19 .
The youngest sexual assault victim is 15 .
The investigation into Stancl began after bomb threats on Nov. 12 and Nov. 13 led to the closure of Eisenhower Middle and High School on Nov 14 .
The sexual assaults occurred throughout 2008 .
District Attorney Brad Schimel said that while the closure of school due to the bomb scare was costly and inconvenient , the charge " pales in comparison " to what investigators learned later .
As police were investigating the bomb threat , which included confiscating Stancl 's computer , one victim came forward , he said .
The boy , who was 15 at the time of the assaults , said he was repeatedly forced into sexual acts with Stancl , according to the complaint .
Stancl took pictures of every encounter .
Stancl was able to coerce the boy into repeated sexual acts by telling him the girl he met on Facebook would release the pictures to the rest of the school if they did n't continue to meet .
The boy went to his parents , and then the police after Stancl asked the boy to get nude pictures of his brother .
The boy refused to get his brother involved .
More than 300 naked photos and movie clips of New Berlin boys and another 600 professionally made pornographic movies involving children were found on the computer , Schimel said .
The computer contained 39 folders that were labeled using the boys ' names or their screen names .
The folders held pictures and movie clips of the boys .
Authorities believe there are more victims and are urging them to come forward , Police Lt. Mike Glider said .
The resulting investigation also turned up computer evidence that Stancl pulled images of females on their Facebook pages and used them to persuade male students to e-mail nude photographs to Stancl , according to the criminal complaint .
Stancl then used the photos as blackmail for sexual encounters , the complaint says .
A criminal complaint filed today charges Stancl with the bomb threats plus repeated sexual assault of same child ( at least three violations of first or second degree sexual assault ) , possession of child pornography , second and third degree sexual assaults and five counts of child enticement .
The maximum penalty if convicted on all charges is nearly 300 years in prison .
Stancl made his initial appearance in court this afternoon and was ordered held on $ 250,000 bail .
" In this court 's 7 1/ 2 years on the bench this is the most horrific complaint the court has ever reviewed , " Waukesha Circuit Court Commissioner Laura Florian Lau said .
" The defendant is facing 293 years if convicted on these 12 counts .
. . .
This is a crime allegedly that involved many , many , many victims .
The court is extremely concerned as to whether defendant will return to court . "
As a condition of bail , Stancl cannot have access to any computers , cell phones or Internet capable devices .
He also was ordered not to be on any school grounds , including school parking lots , and is prohibited from entering the New Berlin Public Library , where he is accused of using computers .
Lau ordered him to have no contact with minors and no contact with any of his victims .
During Stancl 's court appearance , Schimel said that in the days prior to Stancl 's arrest a victim told authorities that he found a note on the windshield of his vehicle , presumably from Stancl .
The note said , " I know what you told police . "
It included statements that " this was n't going to end up well as a result of that , " Schimel said .
Stancl 's attorney , Craig M. Kuhary , said that Stancl has cooperated with authorities during the investigation and is not a flight risk .
He said that Stancl has been expelled from New Berlin High School .
After the hearing , Kuhary declined to comment to the media , except to say that so far only one side of the case has been disclosed .
A preliminary hearing for Stancl has been scheduled for Feb. 26 .
On Nov. 14 , two bomb threats resulted in the closure of New Berlin Eisenhower Middle and High School .
The first threat , " Bomb 11/14/08 " was found scrawled on the wall of a boys bathroom on Nov. 12 .
On Nov. 13 , school administrators received an e-mail that stated , " Good luck tomorrow .
Boom .
It wo n't be your average one either .
It will be one that is manned .
Not by me , but by those who follow me .
New Berlin Eisenhower High School . "
Police learned the e-mail was sent from a computer in New Berlin Public Library .
Stancl was taken into custody on Nov. 14 by New Berlin police after he admitted he played a role in e-mailing a bomb threat to the school , police said .
According to the criminal complaint , he did n't do anything to place a bomb in the school but decided to send the e-mail to " make it a better story , " the complaint says .
He was released from police custody that day after authorities decided that he did n't pose a threat to the public then Stancl was taken into custody Monday afternoon .

In an act affecting owners of 2G cell phones on AT&T Mobility ’s network , including the highly visible , and originally highly expensive first generation iPhone , Open for Business has learned that AT&T has been quietly sacrificing 2G signal strength in an effort to speed up the build out of its next generation 3G network .
The first generation iPhone was trumpeted by the company as recently as seven months ago ; many 2G phones continue to be sold by the Dallas - based company today .
Cell phones , like other wireless communications devices , have certain radio bands they communicate on .
While previously the company had been primarily relying on the 850 MHz band that offers a more robust signal , including superior indoor reception , company technicians confirmed to OFB that transmitters for the 2G signal used by the original iPhone and most other handsets , including most AT&T offered BlackBerry and RAZR models , have been shifted to the weaker 1900 MHz band in some areas .
This shift has resulted in customers past their 30 - day return policy , but still with relatively new phones , finding themselves stuck with equipment no longer able to pick up signals properly in previously strong coverage areas , even though the equipment itself is without defect .
OFB was able to confirm this situation for itself using multiple devices in St. Louis , MO , and also obtained information on similar cases across the country .
Reports suggested the problem started to appear as AT&T ramped up its 3G network in preparation for the iPhone 3G in early 2008 .
Each AT&T technician OFB talked to concerning this problem offered the same solution : that the customer should purchase new , 3G - enabled equipment at the customer ’s own expense .
This has created a troubling situation for many owners of the original iPhone , a device that was as recently as May of 2008 selling for $ 400 .
These users are being told their expensive phones should not only be replaced at the subscriber ’s expense , sometimes less than a year after purchase , but also at an increase in the monthly service rate of $ 10 for data and $ 5 for text messaging .
While the iPhone is the highest profile device impacted by the network change , other high profile , higher - end phones , including all but one of AT&T ’s BlackBerry phones , feature 2G GSM / EDGE radios that could be impacted by this switch .
In all , nearly half of AT&T ’s phones available on its web site are 2G models incompatible with the newer 3G technology .
OFB / T.R. Butler
When I contacted AT&T ’s technical support seeking a solution to the problem , the company did offer a $ 200 one - time credit , a helpful offer , but not nearly enough to offset replacing my family ’s two perfectly functional iPhones and additional Nokia handset ( equipment totaling about $ 1,000 in value over the last two years ) , nor did the company offer to offset the additional fees attached to the new phones ( a cumulative total of $ 30 / month ) .
The standard upgrade offered was pursuant to a new two - year contract on all three lines .
Over the course of the next two years , AT&T ’s offer would cost an additional $ 920 plus tax to restore the level of service previously available .
As an alternative , OFB was also advised by one AT&T customer service representative to consider terminating AT&T service .
The representative then suggested using unofficial information on the Internet to unlock the iPhone for use on another cellular network .
OFB ’s staff collected other similar stories across the country , including the Midwest and both coasts .
A serious question arises for those considering purchasing higher end equipment like the iPhone 3G or Blackberry Bold going forward , either as a new customer or as a customer attempting to escape the 2G problems .
As AT&T looks forward to yet another network upgrade to the 4G LTE network in the coming years , is there any guarantee that new equipment purchased now will not suffer the same fate before its respective contracts expire as well ?
AT&T ’s executive director of analyst relations , Mark Siegel , “ categorically ” denied to OFB that AT&T was advising customers to dump 2G equipment such as the iPhone for 3G versions .
In a follow - up message , Siegel added that the company was not requiring anyone to switch to 3G equipment .
Although that is technically true , customers in affected areas are all but required to upgrade due to the dramatic signal strength drop over the last few months .
OFB also attempted to reach Apple for comment , but had not received a response from the company by press time .

I was doing some tests on the Ubigraph dynamic graph visualization tool and I have this idea to use the Ubigraph tool to render 3D graphs of Twitter friends on real - time .
Follows the video of the scripting utility I ’ve created , it starts with a red node of your twitter and when you click , it shows your friends , when you click on your friends , it shows their friends , and so on .
I think it is interesting those social network graphs , when I got more time I ’ll put more ideas on the pratice =)
Update ( 26/02 ) : download here the script source - code .
To use it , you must install python - twitter , use the easy_install :
easy_install python - twitter
I ’ve tested with Python 2.5 , but it should works on 2.4 and 2.6 too .
Start the Ubigraph visualization server and run the script .
The syntax for the script is like this :
python twitter3d.py -u username

Change is worthless
You know the cliche about being so hard - up for money that you 're checking your couch cushions for change ?
Now that our money is so inflated that some people are talking about doing away with pennies , that 's really not so applicable anymore .
What the hell can you get for a handful of change ?
Not much .
Ever try to pay for something with change ?
Man , that 's embarassing .
You try to get a stack of the same kind of coin , to save the clerk some trouble .
Like a dollar in dimes .
Or a couple of bucks worth of quarters .
But you get halfway there and start mixing in other silver coins .
And pennies ?
Fucking useless .
Which is why you 've got about three times as many of them as you do silver coins .
Every now and then you go to one of those Coinstars , or a machine that counts your change and gives you actual money .
Look at the receipt .
They charged you for your own money !
That should tell you how worthless having change is right there .
Even when I was broke as a joke , I 'd barely ever bend over to pick up anything smaller than a quarter .
Because coins are basically an errand .
And that 's just what you need when you 're poor .
Your social life suffers
People who have n't spent some time under the poverty line do n't know this , but it 's damn near impossible to leave your house without spending some money on something .
Gas money .
Food money .
Ca n't even get a damn cup of coffee for under a dollar .
So how are you supposed to have a social life at all ?
This is why poor people have the best parties .
Go to a cheap apartment .
It 's loud .
Yes , it sucks when you live there and you 're trying to sleep , but the only way to have fun is to have a bunch of people over and share the wealth a little .
Then next time , you go over to their place and they feed you .
Somehow , it 's almost cheaper to feed a bunch of people at once rather than one at a time .
I call this the Jesus effect .
And as for one - at - a - timing social activities , forget about it .
Like I said , you can barely even get a beer or a cup of coffee for under a dollar .
So you 're kind of limited in what you can do .
What do you do ?
Have a friend over to watch TV ?
That 's free .
But it 's boring as hell .
And they could do that at home .
Go to a movie ?
Money .
Go to a restaurant ?
Money .
Have dinner in ?
That 's probably money AND a trip to the grocery store , unless your friend likes exactly what you like to eat -- which they never do .
Holidays are absolutely no fun anymore
There 's nothing more frustrating than Christmas when you do n't have any money .
You start to wonder whether any company in America does Christmas bonuses anymore .
Before long , you 're getting pissed off when someone wishes you a " Happy Holidays . "
And not for the Bill O'Reilly reason .
So you say to yourself that you 'll try to do the holiday on the cheap .
But when you 're poor , just about the only thing you 've got going for you is your friends .
And you do n't want to lose them .
So you ask people for money as a gift .
But nobody wants to do that .
That 's like being stuck up by your friend !
And also , nobody ever wants to give you practical gifts .
Say you need new cookware in the kitchen .
That stuff is expensive .
But if it's on your list , nobody will give it to you even though it 's what you need !
Because nobody wants to be the friend who got someone a skillet for Christmas , even if it was what you wanted .
Being a cheapskate is expensive in a roundabout way
I can't count the number of times I 've been a cheapskate and paid for it in the end .
Often with embarrassing results .
Like the time I bought my wife a bargain - basement , refurbished .mp3 player as a gift .
Then it stopped working about a month later .
Thanks for the paperweight , honey .
And here I thought I was doing her a favor .
You buy jeans at some secondhand store , and they rip right away , or else they 're all stretched out and baggy in weird places after being stretched around some stranger 's body way too many times .
Gross .
And it looks like hell .
Then you wind up spending even more .
When I was hurting for money , I went through maybe 2 - 3 cheapo pots and pans a year .
They 'd bend from the heat or get scratched , or the non -stick coating would come off and look like pepper in my scrambled eggs -- which is funny because I had n't peppered the eggs yet .
Hmm .
I eventually realized I 'd actually spend less if I broke down and just bought some pricier cookware .
And why is it that the worst food for you is also the cheapest ?
We must be the only country on earth with morbidly obese people who barely have a dime to their name .
It 's because of the dollar menu .
Just pray to God that thing does n't make you sick ( either acutely or chronically ) because then your uninsured ass is really screwed .
There 's no time for anything
Can someone explain why when you 're poor , you also have no time ?
Should n't there be a tradeoff ?
Like if you have no money , you should at least have some free time .
But you never do .
I never worked harder than when I was poor .
All the worst , hardest , most unpleasant jobs are also the lowest paying .
That does n't seem right to me .
And if you do n't have a job , looking for a job practically is a job .
I do n't understand how people manage to find a job while they already have one .
It 's like working two jobs at once .
There 's so much time you have to invest , filling out paperwork , making phone calls , following up on phone calls , getting ready for interviews , doing interviews , following up on interviews .
And that 's if it 's going well .
If it 's not , it 's even harder !
Of course , there 's plenty of other stuff to do .
You 've still got to feed yourself and get some sleep .
You 've still got to exercise and have a social life .
If you 've got a significant other , you 've got to take care of them .
There 's so much stuff to do in a day , but there 's no time to do it .
If only you could pay someone to do it for you !
Whoops , forgot .
No money .
Your mobility goes away
I 'm not even talking about travel here , although that goes right out the window as well .
No , what I mean by this is that any medium - to long - term plans to move somewhere else have to be scrapped while you shore up your resources .
It 's a real " dream deferred " situation .
I mean , let 's say you wanted to pack up and move to a state with more and better jobs , where your spouse might get paid more , or where there could be a boost in quality of life .
You might move there and find your fortunes changing in just a few months .
But you simply can't do it because you do n't have the financial freedom to move .
Grabbing your stuff and hitting the road is a tremendous expense , and there 's always unforeseen expenses that come out of nowhere and sock you right in the wallet .
You can save some money by doing everything yourself and not hiring movers , but at the very least you need to pay for a big truck or a friend 's gas money if your friend has a big truck .
It does n't even matter if you 're moving across town or across the country .
The expense is still huge .
It 's more expensive not having money
You know they say , " You have to spend money to make money ? "
Well the flip side to that is that when you do n't have any money , you have to do everything in the most expensive way possible !
If you 're buying something new that you need like furniture or replacing a broken appliance , you 've got to stretch the payments way the hell out so you 're paying for it for years .
If you 're buying a car , you have to get the loan with the lowest payments , which means more interest .
If something breaks , you can't afford to fix it .
Then the maintenance you can't afford to do winds up causing even more damage , putting you in the hole even further !
Probably the worst thing about this is that I did n't even realize how badly the things I could n't afford to fix were costing me until I got the money to pay for them .
When you pay off some old debts , it 's amazing how much money you did n't have before .
If only you 'd had the money in the first place , you 'd have had even more money .
Cruel how that works .
It 's really expensive to run out of money
This goes with what I was just saying .
Why is it that when you have no money , people start hassling you for having no money ?
Like it was a choice you made ?
As though you did n't have enough problems ?
You write a check that it turns out you did n't have the money to cover .
Does n't matter if it was a penny or a C - note .
It 's the same damn fee .
Some banks will actually charge you if you do n't have " enough money " in your account .
Louis CK has a great bit on this :
You think of everything in terms of what you can buy
If you 're pinching pennies long enough , you start to look at the world in a very different way .
Everything has a price tag on it .
Even things that did n't before .
Your co-workers ask you out to lunch .
Aw , geez .
I had planned to go without today .
That 's more expense .
Somebody has a family emergency .
Well , that 's gas money to the hospital .
My wife and I got like this so bad at one point , that we started thinking of our checkbook balances in terms of how many pizzas we could afford using the Little Caesar 's $ 5 pick - up pizza deal .
I do n't know if they still have this anymore .
But if I had $ 50 left in my account , I knew that was 10 pizzas .
You start thinking about things you never thought about before
I played cops and robbers as a kid , but back then it was a game .
As an adult , when I was hurting for money , it was a mental game that took up way too much of my time .
When you start to think about how much $ 1,000 , or even a tenth of that would change your life , you start to understand why people knock over convenience stores .
Then you think , " Naw , that guy behind the counter 's got it just as bad as I do .
He does n't need someone robbing him . "
You hear a radio report about a bank robbery while you 're driving around and you think , " Those people must get away with it , or else they would n't do it so often .
And when was the last time you heard a story about a bank robber getting caught ?
Only when they knock over more than one .
And I do n't need that much money .
Just a few thousand ... "
It 's a little alarming how elaborate these flights of fancy can get when you really start to think about them .
It 's not that you want to think about that stuff , but it just jumps in there .
Poverty kills romance dead
A lot of older couples look back on their early relationship and say , " Ah , we barely had anything back then , but we had each other and we were happy . "
I do n't think I 'll forget just how hard it was to try to maintain a rewarding relationship in the face of having almost no money to spare anytime soon .
Try having a romantic night alone in an apartment where the carpet smells like the previous tenant 's cat pee .
Try wooing your beloved on a Salvation Army mattress with water stains from the leaky roof your cheap landlord wo n't fix .
Try getting busy when you 're wearing stretched - out , holey underwear from two years ago because you can't afford new boxers .
A romantic getaway ?
Is there a Motel 6 there ?
They say fights over money end more marriages than any other cause .
I can definitely see that .
You do n't want to fight about something so stupid , but when it becomes such a big problem that it impacts everything you do and has to be thought about constantly , it 's a struggle not to let it take over .
When you do n't have money , everyone else does
This recession may be the exception to this rule , but probably not yet .
I really hope it does n't get any worse , but if it does , this will become less of a problem .
What I mean is , you really notice when you do n't have any money that it seems like everyone else does .
People invite you out to go to a movie .
Crap , you can't .
No money .
You think about all the fun they 're having without you .
Your neighbor gets a new car , and you want to stab him in the face .
Your other friend never wears the same outfit twice .
Someone sends you a postcard from vacation in Germany .
Must be nice ...
I 'm betting the person who wrote " Thou shalt not covet " for the first time was in a pretty comfortable position , economically speaking .
Because comparing and contrasting your life with everyone else 's is practically all you do when you 're broke .
And why not ?
It 's a free activity .
As I said , there 's precious few of those .
There 's no ceiling on money , but there 's damn sure a floor
Cutting back on expenses and purchases is an art form .
For a while it 's fun .
You cut back and begin to see the results .
That 's rewarding .
But there comes a point where there 's no more fat to be trimmed -- at least not without costing you even more in ways you did n't expect .
You can't not buy warmer clothes for winter , or you 'll have to deal with doctor 's bills .
You can't not repair your car , or there 's no more paychecks from work .
You might consider getting a bike , but that 's capital you do n't have .
You try to make your groceries last longer , but then you wind up spending even more at the store because you 're now out of everything .
People tend to think that you can always spend less .
I know so - called personal finance experts like to say it , but it 's not always true .
There 's no more frustrating place to be than when you 've chopped every extra from your budget and there 's nowhere else to go .
You try to do something free , and it usually sucks
Then one day , you wake up and say to yourself , " You know , the best things in life really are free !
I 'm going to enjoy what life has to offer , and screw the money ! "
So you take a walk around the block .
Hey , it feels good .
You 're exercising .
It 's actually a little relaxing .
Then , damn !
The next day the balls of your feet are all sore and your arches ache .
Man , I could use some walking shoes and some more appropriate walking attire .
Oh , wait .
That 's money .
Then you reach into your wallet and dust off your library card .
Great idea !
Hey , my taxes are paying for it anyway .
I 'd be an idiot not to pay the library a visit !
Then you sit down to read a book , and some creepy - looking guy is watching porn at the computer .
Ughhh ...
You need a cheap date , so you try to do something romantic but free .
You make a picnic lunch and take it to the park .
When you get there , some hippies kick their hackey - sack into your salad , bees and ants pester you , you discover you spread your blanket on dog shit , and then some young punks make off with your pick - a- nick basket .
And it seemed like such a good idea ...
The moral : No , money can't buy happiness *
* But it can certainly prevent you from having to deal with a lot of bullshit that gets in the way of your happiness .
And it can give you the flexibility and free time to be with people who make you happy .
And it can stop you from worrying so much , thus making you happy .
You get goddamn tired of thinking about money .
It 's freaking demoralizing !
I did n't mean this to be a bring - down .
I 'm sorry if you reacted that way to it .
Just wanted to offer a few laughs from somebody who 's been there , and could return there lickety - split .
I always found that the best source of good vibes was always friends who took your concerns seriously and made you feel better about them without judging you or questioning whether your problems were legitimate .
Often these people would be in the same boat you were , or at least they could remember a time when they were struggling just as hard or harder .
I hope I can be one of those people for you .
If there 's an upside to this recession , it 's that many of us are finding out that we 're not alone .
That can be a huge source of comfort .
The Lamborghini Insecta Concept is a design study of a 2 - seater mid-engined supercar created by Romanian Iulian Bumbu .
The design combines the brand ’s styling cues with elements inspired by insect exoskeletons .
As Iulian Bumbu explains " The idea was to create an extreme race - oriented supercar with a style that introduces softer and more organic lines and integrate them into the geometrical style of Lamborghini . "
The main inspiration came from nature , and in particular from the exoskeletons found in insects ( bugs ) .
This kind of " armour " appearance is particularly visible in the back and top views .
" I tried to apply this tipe of organic movements and translate them into Lamborghini ’s style so that when you see the car , you can immediately recognize it as a Lambo . "
The dimensions af the car are a length of 4,300 mm ( the same as the Gallardo ) , a height of 1,000 mm and a width of 2,000 mm , with a wheelbase of 2,650 mm .
The body structure and panels are made of carbon - fiber and the powertrain is the same adopted on the Gallardo .
About the Designer
Iulian Bumbu was born on 21 July 1981 in Bechet ( Romania ) .
He received a Master Diploma in Car Design from Scuola Politecnica di Design Milano ( 2007 -2008 ) , and a degree from National University of Art Bucharest –
Product Design Department ( 2004 ) .
Among his professional experience are a three - months internship at Centro Stile Alfa Romeo ( 2008 ) and three years of experience as a 3d modeler and texture artist at AMC Studio .

Animals obviously hook up , at least during mating season .
But do they like it ?
According to experts , there are two answers : " yes " and " it is impossible to know . "
" Mosquitoes , I do n’t know , " hedged Mark Bekoff , a University of Colorado biologist and author of " The Emotional Lives of Animals " ( New World Library ) , " but across mammals , they enjoy sex . "
In fact the enjoyment of sex among humans and among animals may be similar in that it's all experienced in very primitive parts of the brain .
Really wild orgasms
Not only do animals enjoy the deed , they also likely have orgasms , he said .
They are difficult to measure directly but by watching facial expressions , body movements and muscle relaxation , many scientists have concluded that animals reach a pleasurable climax , he said .
Then why do , say , wolves abstain most of the year ?
" It is not that they do n’t like it , it is just who they are , " Bekoff said .
In the wild , having sex makes one vulnerable to attack .
For example , a male wolf gets " locked " inside the female for up to a half hour , he said .
Besides , if wolves got it on during the summer , it would be poor family planning ; their delicate pups would be born in the dead of winter , he said .
Humans , though , are not alone in wanting sex regardless of reproductive timing .
Bonobos and possibly dolphins also pursue sex recreationally , Bekoff said .
Al that said , we can never completely know another being 's emotional state , Bekoff points out , adding that it can even be hard to judge that of a human .
And we can't ask a tomcat how his date went last night .
Kent Berridge , a biopsychologist at the University of Michigan , compared the brain activity and facial expressions of animals to that of a more readable creature : human infants .
When given something pleasurable to taste , both rats and humans make almost identical mouth shapes and sucking motions .
Their brain reactions also mirror one another .
If we believe the infant " enjoys " the sweet taste based on her pleasant expression , it follows that the rat likely enjoys it too .
Primitive feelings Sweets and sex — as well as drugs , winning the lotto and every other rewarding experience — stimulate the same brain circuit , said Berridge , and this pleasure circuit is common to both human and non-human animals .
His experiments suggest a further homology , one of emotional experience .
" Our chief anatomical difference from [ other animals ] is up in the prefrontal cortex , " explained Berridge , but the generation of pleasure is happening at " lower " brain structures .
The human cortex may interpret pleasurable sensations and assign them special meaning ( or not ) .
In this way , a human ’s experience of sex may be qualitatively different than an animal ’s , but no less ( or more ) enjoyable .
And of course , Nature offers her own proof that sex is pleasurable : plentiful offspring .
" There are damn good evolutionary reasons for animals to enjoy sex and have orgasms , " said Bekoff .
" My null hypothesis is that they do , " he said , adding a challenge : " Prove that they do n't . "

A West Midlands sandwich bar worker who was prosecuted after footage of him stuffing lettuce up his nose appeared on YouTube has avoided a jail term .
Richard Benjamin Shannon , 22 , of Castle Street , Brownhills , was ordered to do 300 hours of unpaid work for last year 's offence at Subway in Brownhills .
He claimed the incident was a prank and the lettuce was discarded and not sold .
Walsall magistrates said he had avoided a jail term due to his " early guilty plea " and because he had shown remorse .
In the footage taken on a friend 's mobile phone Shannon was also seen putting lettuce leaves in his mouth and spitting them out .
Shannon , who was prosecuted under the miscellaneous provisions in the Public Order Act , could have been jailed for up to six months .
' Serious lesson '
He was arrested after an irate woman hurled a chair at him after recognising him in the clip on the video - sharing website , Walsall Magistrates '
Court heard .
Magistrates ' chairman Elizabeth Baugh , who viewed the video footage , said his actions could have merited a custodial sentence .
She told him : " Your actions caused great distress , not only to the public who consume this food , but also to the company .
" I think you have learnt a very , very serious lesson . "
Shannon 's defence solicitor , Shelia Hicklin , said the offence was a sign of his immaturity .
" He had absolutely no idea that the person who was in the shop with him was going to put this on YouTube .
" I do n't think there has been any suggestion that any member of the public was harmed . "
She said that no - one would have eaten the lettuce because it was discarded .
The Australian - born singer enjoyed a prolific career , with hits that included “ I Do n’t Know How To Love Him ” from “ Jesus Christ Superstar , ” “ Ai n’t No Way To Treat a Lady , ” “ Delta Dawn , ” “ Angie Baby ” and “ You and Me Against the World . ”
( CNN ) -- A man walks into a thrift store .
A New Zealand man finds confidential U.S. military files on a used MP3 player he bought at a thrift store for $ 9 .
It sounds like the opening line to a bad joke .
And this case was a bad joke -- for the Pentagon .
Chris Ogle of New Zealand was in Oklahoma about a year ago when he bought a used MP3 player from a thrift store for $ 9 .
A few weeks ago , he plugged it into his computer to download a song , and he instead discovered confidential U.S. military files .
" The more I look at it , the more I see , and the less I think I should be , " Ogle said with a nervous laugh in an interview with TVNZ .
The files included the home addresses , Social Security numbers and cell phone numbers of U.S. soldiers .
The player also included what appeared to be mission briefings and lists of equipment deployed to hot spots in Afghanistan and Iraq .
Most of the information appears to date to 2005 .
The New Zealand journalist who first reported the story was able to contact at least one of the soldiers by dialing a phone number found in the files .
He hung up once she explained why she was calling .
Watch how man discovered secret military files »
Pentagon officials told CNN that they are aware of the MP3 player , but can't talk about it until investigators confirm that the information came from the U.S. Department of Defense .
" The government is n't doing a good job of protecting the information that it collects , " said Marc Rotenberg of the Electronic Privacy Information Center in Washington .
Despite government efforts to protect sensitive information , this is a growing problem , privacy experts say .
Two years ago , the Department of Veterans Affairs lost track of a laptop with the personal information of millions of soldiers .
And computer hard drives with classified military information have been found for sale at street markets in Afghanistan .
" When you can identify American personnel , when you have their names , their home address , their cell phone numbers , you put people in a dangerous position , " Rotenberg said .
In this case , the personal information for several hundred soldiers landed in friendly hands .
Ogle told CNN the MP3 player is being kept in a safe place and he will happily turn it over to U.S. military officials if they ask for it .

Nope – this is not an April fools post .
Spirit Airlines , one of the cheapest of the US low cost carriers is working behind the scenes to introduce a “ passenger usage fee ” which is just a snazzy way of describing a fee to cover the costs of you buying a ticket .
That ’s right – Spirit Airlines is going to charge you , in order to charge you .
The fee is rumored to be $ 5 or $ 10 , and will apply to any booking made anywhere other than the Spirit Airlines ticket desk at your airport .
The whole thing sounds like a joke gone bad , but it is actually the result of negotiations with the Department of Transportation .
Spirit had initially launched a whole lineup of ridiculous fees last year , including what they called a “ natural occurrence interruption fee ” ; a $ 2.50 fee to help recover the costs involved with storms and other weather related incidents .
The DOT was not amused , and Spirit was handed a $ 40,000 fine .
Spirit clearly learned their lesson , because this time they are negotiating with the DOT how to implement these new fees .
One area of concern is whether Spirit will be forced to include the fee in all their advertising , or whether they can keep it hidden until the last moment , usually when you and I pull out our credit cards .
The end result may be that they need to advertise it on their own site , but that third party booking sites wo n’t be forced to mention it until the last page of your booking process .
In my opinion , the whole fee process is just becoming silly – yes , we consumers are always looking for nice cheap tickets , but we are not entirely stupid .
When a $ 100 ticket becomes $ 200 after all the fees and taxes , we know we are not getting a good deal .
Fingers crossed that the DOT keeps us in mind when they finally approve this new fee racket .

Observers worldwide have been expressing great pity for the people of Gaza , many of whom have been killed , injured , or forced to flee their homes during the ongoing IDF operation .
This pity may be a natural emotional reaction , yet it is unethical and immoral .
To pity the people of Gaza is to patronize them , in essence implying that they do not control their fate , the state of their government , or their own actions .
It is to assume one of two things : Either that Gazans are too stupid to oust the cancerous Hamas presence in their midst , or that they are unable to do so .
Just as a crying baby who only elicits pity will continue to cry , the citizens of Gaza will continue to cry out to the world instead of taking matters into their own hands .
As long as they are told that they are helpless victims or mere pawns at the hands of terrorists , Gazans will only see their suffering prolonged .
The residents of Gaza , and the Palestinians as a whole , say they would like their own state .
Yet such state must be earned .
And earning a state – a piece of land to call your own – takes much more than incessant whining to the international community coupled with a desire to drive out the Jews .
It requires inner strength and the ability to create rather than destroy .
This is what Israelis proved time and again for over 60 years , and this is what Palestinians have yet to prove .
Yet before the people of Gaza are able to build , Hamas must be obliterated .
Moreover , Hamas ' ultimate defeat must not be at the hands of the IDF , but rather , it is an endeavor that must be undertaken by Gaza residents themselves .
After all , Hamas is the true reason for their misery .
Those who believe that Gazans are capable of this should do away with their pity .
As to those who do not believe Gazans can do it - why waste time pitying them in the first place ?

MANORVILLE
MONA T. KANCIPER scanned the pastures that ring her blue and white barn , now at close to capacity and crammed with four - legged creatures temporarily , and in some instances permanently , residing here for lack of anywhere else to go .
As the hard - driving president of New York Horse Rescue , a nonprofit organization that had its origins in the rehabilitation of racetrack castoffs but now copes with all breeds in all manner of predicaments , she is more interested in rescuing horses than whispering to them .
But , like most horse - lovers , she occasionally does that as well .
By chance , she met the liquid brown eye of a previously homeless , malnourished and unwanted Irish thoroughbred named Maple , plucked from a backyard shed on Long Island .
His ribs poked out like bicycle spokes and his attitude verged on sour when she took him in .
Hunger and loneliness had taken a toll .
Trust issues ?
He had those , too .
“ This is definitely a very bad time to be a horse , ” Ms. Kanciper said , confirming the negative development  driven by panicky , cash - strapped owners and an unforgiving economy  that has uprooted Maple and an as - yet - unknown number of his species .
Reports of a surge in abandoned or neglected horses ; of overcrowded rescue , auction and retirement facilities ; and of unwanted equines being fattened in feedlots before being shipped to slaughter in Mexico and in Canada have prompted the Unwanted Horse Coalition , an offshoot of the American Horse Council , to undertake a national survey on the problem .
According to Dr. Tom Lenz , a veterinarian who is the chairman of the coalition , although the elimination of domestic slaughterhouses has reduced the total number of horses killed , 100,000 to 150,000 are still exported for slaughter each year .
“ So we know they ’re unwanted , ” he said .
“ America needs a wake - up call about this issue .
The general population has this love affair with the horse without realizing the costs and complications of owning horses in this economy . ”
Hats off this fine morning to Ryanair , which last week traded blows with " idiot blogger " Jason Roe and in the process demonstrated exactly how airlines should deal with bothersome self - loading cargo .
The whole thing kicked off when Jason posted details of an apparent glitch which allowed him to get Ryanair tickets for nowt .
Well , this did n't go down too well with one loyal member of the airline 's staff , who responded with the following comment : " jason !
you ’re an idiot and a liar !!
fact is !
you ’ve opened one session then another and requested a page meant for a different session , you are so stupid you dont even know how you did it !
you dont get a free flight , there is no dynamic data to render which is prob why you got 0.00 .
what self respecting developer uses a crappy CMS such as word press anyway AND puts they ’re mobile ph number online , i suppose even a prank call is better than nothing on a lonely sat evening !! "
Jason duly replied : " Hello Ryanair staffer ..
I have not lied , I found a bug in your site that allows a user to see a 0.00 price listed beside a flight .
Yes , I have cleared a session , but you have not prevented session jumping !
I hope to god a Ryanair management type reads this .
" Crappy CMS such as wordpress .. its a blog ?
I put my mobile phone number online as im a freelance developer .
At least I provide a phone number on my website , no premium lines here . "
Cue further Ryanair body blows , including this rather tasty example of good public relations :
Website is not perfect , Life is not perfect …
If you would work in your pathetic life on a such big project in a such busy environment with so little resources , you would know that the most important is to have usual user behavior scenarios working rather than spending time on improbable and harmless things .
We very well know about these anomalies and unless it is not critical we are not going to sacrifice time to this .
If you would be a serious programmer you would know these things and would not post any of this on the web if you would think it can cause us troubles , but you would report to us directly .
Even you did not discover anything major you are still trying to benefit from this .
If I would be you I would think of consequences this can have .
If you would be a serious developer you would work out your About page as well .
Or is this really about you ?
What is that bunch of links there ?
I could give my review of those websites and it would not be positive probably , but really I do n’t know if you actually worked on them or what exactly you did and how big influence you had to make changes there .
So keep working on yourself and do n’t post bollocks .
Oh dear , oh dear .
Finally , Ryanair spokespitbull Stephen McNamara weighed into the fray , and clarified the company 's position vis -a - vis bloggers .
He said : " Ryanair can confirm that a Ryanair staff member did engage in a blog discussion .
It is Ryanair policy not to waste time and energy corresponding with idiot bloggers and Ryanair can confirm that it wo n't be happening again .
" Lunatic bloggers can have the blog sphere [ sic ] all to themselves as our people are far too busy driving down the cost of air travel . "
Splendid .
That 'll teach young Jason to keep his deranged ramblings to himself . ®
Officials say the spill is 99 % contained after a pipe broke and released partially treated waste into the body of water
This article is more than 11 years old

A broken pipe gushed at least 500,000 gallons of partially treated sewage into San Francisco bay by Wednesday afternoon as Sausalito , California sanitary plant officials continued to try to contain the spill more than 24 hours after it was spotted .
Bob Simmons , general manager of the Sausalito - Marin city sanitary district , said shortly after 2 pm that the spill was 99 % contained .
Workers in wetsuits were trying to seal up a metal '' saddle ' ' placed around the 24 - inch - wide pressure pipeline resting along the shore below the Fort Baker treatment plant to redirect wastewater back into the plant .
The spill was first spotted at about 1 pm on Tuesday at the district 's treatment plant in the Golden Gate national recreational area .
After several hours of unsuccessful attempts to plug the 2 - inch hole before the pipe was submerged in tide water , the leak was allowed to continue until work could continue on Wednesday morning .
'' This situation is unfortunate , '' said Simmons , noting the district 's largest previous spill was 63,000 gallons in January 2008 .
Simmons said the hole likely was due to corrosion of the 23 - year - old pipe constantly exposed to tide water .
He said officials did n't have the option to shut off flow to the broken pipe because all pipes in the small plant on the steep hill just south of downtown Sausalito were interconnected and under pressure .
'' This treatment plant has some challenges that most plants do n't have , '' Simmons said .
Warning signs indicating sewage contamination remain posted along nearby shoreline including Sweet 's Beach , Horseshoe Cove , Schoonmaker Point Marina and Rodeo Beach .
City officials in Sausalito , Tiburon and Belvedere have also posted signs along their shores .
Becky Ng , interim deputy director of the Marin county environmental health services , recommended people stay out of the water in the surrounding area .
Officials expected test results of initial water samples to be available today .
The district was one of nine southern Marin sewage agencies ordered to submit improvement plans to the environmental protection agency last year in response to the federal agency 's orders in April to fix chronic problems including spills , sewer maintenance and a network of aging pipes .
The orders followed federal inspections of the districts in August and October 2007 .
The Museum of tolerance / Simon Weisenthal Center is a human rights exhibition in Los Angeles .
They have completely renovated the inside , and on the audio side they have installed a 308 channel sound system with 5 subwoofers .
That ’s not 308 + 5 speakers – that ’s 308 + 5 separate channels .
The audio / visual system is made by Iosono Sound and on the video side of things it includes a Christie 5000 - lumen 3 - chip DLP high - def projector and also a motorized masking system to change the aspect ratio of the display .
The audio system is the first of its type in the US , and the theater had to be stripped down to its struts to install it so that the speakers are all hidden from view .
The system utilizes waveform synthesis allowing for effects and movement of sound that have never been reproduced before now .
Because of the way the sound is distributed , every seat in the house is great .
This is a super cool system , and I would love to hear it in action .
It does n’t quite hold a candle to the $ 6 Million home theater though .
All I can think of is how mixing for 308.5 must be absolute pain .

A reward of $ 250,000 has reportedly been offered by Microsoft to find who is behind the Downadup / Conficker virus .
Since its inception last October , the Conficker worm has infected millions of computers worldwide .
Microsoft is offering a cash reward because they view the Conficker as a criminal attack and believe the people responsible for writing it have to be held accountable .
As noted by Sophos , Microsoft 's reputation is badly shaken whenever a computer virus causes widespread problems for its users , so it 's not surprising that they would offer a reward .

George Stathakopulos of Microsoft's Trustworthy Computing Group told the BBC News that they were not prepared to sit back and let this kind of activity go unchecked .
" Our message is very clear -- whoever wrote this caused significant pain to our customers and we are sending a message that we will do everything we can to help with your arrest " he said .

A report from Arbor Network Security says as many as 12 million computers worldwide could now be affected by Downadup / Conficker .

MS Security Patches Protect Your PC
Keeping your Windows computer up - to - date with the latest security patches from Microsoft should keep you safe .
The Downadup / Conficker worm -- a self - replicating program -- takes advantage of networks or computers that have not been patched with the latest security updates .
It infects machines via a net connection or by hiding on USB memory drives .
Once installed on your system , it can be difficult to remove .
The worm replicates through networks by guessing user names and passwords .
Hardening your passwords with a mix of numbers , punctuation marks , and capital letters is recommended by security specialists as a way to keep passwords more secure .
Downadup / Conficker updates hackers using it by visiting a web domain where it generates the name of the domain itself by using a complicated code .
Security firms have cracked this code in hopes of tracking the growth of the worm and its progress .
The malware can be triggered to steal data or take control of infected computers .
Malicious hackers can pool systems into virtual armies of so - called botnets that are used to send spam or employ them as dead drops for stolen or pirated data .
( Source : bbc.co.uk )
According to the BBC News , Downadup / Conficker is widespread and has caused headaches for network administrators dealing with users with weak passwords .
The security patch that fixes the vulnerability in Windows and avoids all the headaches is available from Microsoft .

Microsoft's Anti-Virus Reward Program
Microsoft has partnered with security companies , domain name providers , academia , Internet Service Providers and The U.S. Departments of Justice and Homeland Security to initiate a coordinated global response to the Downadup / Conficker worm .
Microsoft created its reward program with $ 5 million in funding in 2003 to help law enforcement agencies bring malicious software authors to justice .
Microsoft entered into the partnership to create the anti-virus reward program supporting Interpol , the FBI and the Secret Service .
( Source : microsoft.com )
This is the first time in four years that Microsoft has offered a reward in response to a worm outbreak , the last time being in 2004 with the outbreak of the Sasser worm whose author was arrested and sentenced by German authorities .
Three other major computer worm threats -- Blaster , MyDoom and Sobig -- had rewards of $ 250,000 offered , but those perpetrators have never been caught .

BAGHDAD ( Reuters ) -
The number of U.S. troops killed in combat in Iraq has fallen to its lowest level since they invaded in 2003 , the spokesman for U.S. forces in Iraq said on Wednesday .
U.S. soldiers stand guard during a graduation ceremony of former neighbourhood patrol members , known locally as " Sahwas " from a training course in Baghdad 's Jihad District , March 24 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Bassim Shati
In the first two months of this year 19 U.S. soldiers were killed in Iraq , down from 148 in the same period two years ago , Major - General David Perkins told a joint news conference with Baghdad security spokesman Major - General Qassim Moussawi .
Moussawi said the number of militant attacks documented last week in Baghdad was at a record low .
“ U.S. combat deaths ( in Iraq ) are at the lowest level since the war began six years ago today , a decrease of over 90 percent , ” Perkins said .
Reuters data showed that the number of U.S. troops killed in Iraq from the invasion in 2003 to March 17 totaled 4,259 .
In the same period between 91,121 and 99,500 Iraqi civilians were killed , according to data from www.iraqbodycount.net, run by academics and peace activists .
The U.S. toll includes deaths in Iraq and the surrounding area where troops are stationed .
For the first time , Baghdad ’s central morgue last week recorded no unidentified bodies dumped on the city streets , Moussawi said , down from 50 to 180 a day at the height of the sectarian violence in 2006 .
He announced plans to re-open a major route through Baghdad that passes through the heavily fortified Green Zone in the city center , where traffic is currently strictly controlled .
The district is seen as a symbol of the U.S. occupation and the heart of its military and diplomatic operations in Iraq , as well as the site of several Iraqi ministries .
The route is due to be opened within two months , Moussawi said .
“ 2009 is the year to reopen all the streets in Baghdad , ” he said .
Despite the upbeat assessment , bombings , kidnappings and shootings remain common in Baghdad , and a Sunni- led insurgency is still raging in the northern city of Mosul and northeastern Diyala province .
On Monday , a bomb at a bus terminal in west Baghdad ’s Abu Ghraib district killed nine people and wounded 23 , Iraqi police said .
Less than two weeks earlier , a suicide bomber killed 28 people and wounded 28 in the same area .
Souring the security outlook , at least 40 people released from prison under an amnesty law meant to foster reconciliation between Iraq ’s majority Shi’ites and minority Sunnis were re-arrested last week , Moussawi said .
Many thousands of mostly Sunni prisoners are being held in U.S. and Iraqi jails .
The cable industry has done a remarkable job building out its networks , offering consumers a service that lets them watch hi-definition television and download Web content at blazing speeds .
But as Apple ( AAPL ) and the iPhone taught the cellphone industry , hardware is n't everything .
Software -- especially the interface that your customers interact with -- is arguably more important .
That 's where cable giants like Comcast ( CMCSA ) and Time Warner Cable ( TWC ) are weak .
And potential rivals , such as Apple , Hulu , and Boxee , are strong .
We are surprised by how lousy today 's set - top box software is .
The user interface has barely changed in ten years .
Searching through programs on hundreds of channels ( and various on - demand listings ) requires an immense amount of patience or muscle memory .
And the set - top box shows no signs that it 's connected to the same pipe as the Internet .
What needs to happen ?
A much better user interface all - around .
Clearer and simpler , especially menus .
Browsing shows should n't just be a linear channel guide , but a real search experience , that 's as visual as text - based .
Get inspired by the iPhone and the Nintendo Wii -- not an old TV Guide magazine .
Apps , widgets , motion - sensitive remotes , whatever .
Use the Internet more .
Pull in reviews from Rotten Tomatoes , Netflix , and Amazon .
Let subscribers send out the shows they 're watching on Twitter .
Let us watch what our Facebook friends are watching .
Figure out a way to get every Web video ever on the cable box via On Demand .
We should n't have to boot up our laptop if we want to watch YouTube , MTV music videos , or our favorite video podcast .
What might make this a more realistic reality ?
Tru2Way , a cable technology the companies will talk plenty about at their annual conference in Washington D.C. this week .
What is it ?
Tru2Way -- which Comcast CEO Brian Roberts wooed everyone with at CES last year -- is supposed to let people access cable programming without a cable - supplied set - top box .
This means you could plug your cable cord directly into a Panasonic Tru2 Way TV , getting access to all the channels , On Demand , movie rentals , etc .
Or it could plug into a Tru2 Way - ready Blu-ray player , Apple TV , TiVo , Xbox , whatever .
This , in theory , means that the cable companies themselves could sit back while someone like Apple , Google , or Microsoft figures out the software stuff , building a TV gadget with a really awesome user interface that hooks into Internet services , etc .
Then Comcast could buy a bunch and lease them out , or just let customers buy their own .
But there 's no guarantee any of that will ever happen .
So the cable companies themselves actually need to think about software , too .
Why bother ?
It 's not like the cable companies are in grave danger of losing many of their customers in the next few years .
They still have the benefit of owning their own dedicated pipe , having set - top boxes in tens of millions of living rooms , and having the best content , live -- which Internet - based rivals do n't .
For example , Apple and Netflix ( NFLX ) offer some movies and TV shows online , but selection is limited and nothing is live .
Free Internet video services like Hulu and YouTube are growing , but still are designed mostly for watching in short bursts on a PC .
And anyway , TV networks are even starting to shy away from throwing everything online for free , opting to work closer with the cable companies , which -- unlike Internet advertising -- actually generate revenue .
But eventually , it 's possible that most people wo n't need to pay a cable company $ 80 per month to get a solid entertainment experience .
We -- admittedly , not TV junkies -- cut the cord last year , any many of our friends have , too .
It 's possible that through iTunes , Netflix , Hulu , TV.com , and services like Major League Baseball 's MLB .TV , we 'll get enough stuff to watch .
And with excellent video browsing software like Boxee to put it all together , the cable companies could actually face a real challenge .
That 's why we hope someone at the cable conference in D.C. this week -- whether in a keynote or somewhere in a corner -- is talking seriously about software .
This afternoon , in Denver , Colorado , President Barack Obama signed the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act , also known in US political circles as the " stimulus bill " .
The bill provides new spending , tax cuts and aid to state and local governments all totaling almost $ 800 billion US dollars , making it the largest spending bill in that nation 's history .
Designed to create jobs and provide a boost to a sagging economy , the bill focuses on green , renewable energy and investments in health care technology .
Of immediate interest to us , however , is the accompanying website , recovery.gov , which — you guessed it — is using Drupal !
Drupal is no stranger to the political arena , and has been used for many campaign and government sites before .
Recovery.gov , though , is a definite coup for Drupal — there are not many Drupal sites that have their own post on Whitehouse.gov .
Or on the Huffington Post .
Or is featured on CNN all day long .
Or has its own YouTube promo by the US President .
Unbelievable !
MAGNET senior editor Matthew Fritch once camped out for 13 hours to have Morrissey sign his copy of the “ Interesting Drug ” single ; this was topped only by a more dignified encounter with Johnny Marr .
He is closing in on Andy Rourke and Mike Joyce even as he types out the five most overrated and five most underrated Smiths songs .
:: The Five Most Overrated Smiths Songs
1. “ How Soon Is Now ? ” ( 1984 )
An innovative , mold - breaking sonic experiment for the stodgily jangly Smiths ?
Nah .
Sounds like Johnny Marr stepped on a few effects pedals , leaned his Rickenbacker against the amp and left the studio to get a pint .
Not a bad song by any means , but “ How Soon Is Now ? ” has long outlived the initial impact of its tremolo - encrusted riff .
Stop sampling it .
Stop covering it ( badly ) .
If this guitar line sounds fresh to you in 2009 , the Kinks ’ discovery of electric - guitar distortion on “ You Really Got Me ” 20 years prior is going to blow your fucking mind and it will take the combined efforts of Sonic Youth , My Bloody Valentine , Dick Dale , Dinosaur Jr , Jimi Hendrix , Smashing Pumpkins and Chet Atkins to reassemble your rock ‘ n ’ roll paradigm .
2. “ Heaven Knows I ’m Miserable Now ” ( 1984 )
Over the course of this song , Morrissey is miserable because : a ) he is no longer drunk ; b ) he found a job ; and c ) the sight of two lovers makes him feel lonely .
This is a reasonable scenario until we realize that , at that time , Morrissey : a ) does n’t drink alcohol ; b ) has never been employed ; and c ) is celibate by choice .
Aside from this logical disconnect , the song represents Morrissey ’s worst , self - parodic self - pity and is further handicapped by one of Marr ’s most wilted - sounding compositions .
Mentally delusional and emotionally defeated , it ’s like the sad feeling you got when you were six and your Sea Monkeys died .
3. “ Shakespeare ’s Sister ” ( 1985 ) and “ Pretty Girls Make Graves ” ( 1984 )
Each of these Smiths songs got a ( pretty terrible ) band named after them , so somebody must have rated them pretty highly .
“ Shakespeare ’s Sister ” is a trainwreck ; it literally sounds like a locomotive derailed after striking a herd of water buffalo crossing the tracks .
One listen to the Troy Tate demo of “ Pretty Girls Make Graves , ” and you ’ll realize it ’s an unsalvageably uncool oompah song at its core .
Both these tracks feature unhinged Morrissey moaning , a topic I will address in detail next week during a discussion of “ November Spawned A Monster . ”
Wait for it !
“ Shakespeare ’s Sister ” :
“ Pretty Girls Make Graves ( Troy Tate Demo ) ” :
4. “ Girlfriend In A Coma ” ( 1987 )
I once thought this song was funnily macabre , a musical counterpoint to Harold & Maude or Weekend At Bernie ’s II .
Today , I suspect that not only is Morrissey responsible for his girlfriend being in a coma , he also would n’t mind pulling the plug .
It only takes him two minutes and two seconds to go from “ I know , I know , it ’s serious ” to “ Let me whisper my last goodbyes . ”
Needless to say , had Morrissey directed Million Dollar Baby , the film would ’ve ended much sooner .
5. “ Panic ” ( 1986 )
Because 23 years later , the war is over and the DJs have won .
:: The Five Most Underrated Smiths Songs
1. “ Back To The Old House ” ( 1984 )
This is an excellent example of Marr ’s ability to write complex fingerpicked melodies that would sound just as lovely and ornate if played on piano .
( Back off , Christopher O’Riley . )
I like to think that Marr handed Morrissey the tape of his instrumental guitar demo for this song with a note attached to it : “ Do n’t fuck it up . ” Morrissey did n’t .
He recognized the vocals needed to take a relative backseat , and he turned in an appropriately subdued melody .
If the lyrics were more typically hyperpersonal , “ Back To The Old House ” would be as iconic as “ Please , Please , Please Let Me Get What I Want . ”
It ’s perfect the way it is .
2. “ You Just Have n’t Earned It Yet , Baby ” ( 1987 )
I suppose the lyrics convey a positive message to all you hard workers out there , but the real genius of this song is that it hardly breaks a sweat .
By conservative estimate , it ’s 70 percent chorus .
The verse is a crudely made wooden footstool for the bejeweled chorus , which appears three times ; then there ’s a five - or 10 - second gap ( really , there ’s nothing there ) before the chorus appears for a fourth time !
What can I say ?
It ’s a really good chorus .
3. “ Vicar In A Tutu ” ( 1986 )
Not exactly overlooked , but considering there could ’ve easily been seven singles off The Queen Is Dead , “ Vicar In A Tutu ” is a relatively dark horse from those sessions .
Given the album ’s blunt - object approach to protesting royalty ( the title track ) , it ’s a bit of a shock that Morrissey chose to attack the hypocrisy of the church with such deft humor .
In particular , the imagery of the cross - dressing clergyman sliding down the church banister elicits a perfectly exasperated - sounding “ My God , the vicar in a tutu . ”
This light touch is extended to the lilting melody and efficiently Byrdsy guitars .
4. “ Still Ill ” ( 1984 )
If a song appears on two separate Smiths best - ofs , can it really be underrated ?
I offer “ Still Ill ” as a counterpoint to the above condemnation of “ Heaven Knows I ’m Miserable Now , ” the better - known of Morrissey ’s flat - out admissions of serious depression .
“ Still Ill ” is indignant , charged and funny to a degree .
( At least I think “ England is mine , it owes me a living ” is meant as a nonserious demand . )
Marr forces Morrissey to keep up with a guitar riff that spans four bars and an unrelenting flurry of notes .
Marr ’s busy songwriting pushed Morrissey where he needed to go , providing a foil that ’s been noticeably absent from his subsequent solo career .
5. “ Paint A Vulgar Picture ” ( 1987 )
By this point , I ’ve been exposed as a Marr loyalist in the ongoing saga of the Morrissey / Marr so - called “ severed alliance . ”
( I ’m referring to the hated Johnny Rogan book of that title , which Morrissey once referred to , brilliantly , as The Sausage Appliance .
However , please note I ’m not so overzealous as to include Marr instrumentals such as “ The Draize Train ” on the underrated list . )
Marr had to wait five years to get a guitar solo in a Smiths song , and it appears on “ Paint A Vulgar Picture . ”
It ’s glorious .
It tells another story within the song .
Small woodland creatures live and play in the space occupied by its purposeful notes .
But Morrissey shines here , too , with the tale of a fading pop star and battles with record companies in which the fans are the ultimate casualties of continuously repackaged greatest - hits and compilation albums .
I wish it were n’t so prophetic .
I wish it were n’t so prophetic .
I wish it were n’t so prophetic .
I wish it were n’t so prophetic .
I wish it were n’t so prophetic .
Coming next Tuesday : Fritch picks the five most overrated and five most underrated Morrissey songs .
The government will hit gangs where it hurts - on the internet and in their wardrobes .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith today announced plans to insert provisions into the Policing and Crime Bill that would allow courts to impose a range of restrictions on individuals .
These include not allowing individuals to enter a " specified place " , for example a gang 's " territory " , and banning them from using and threatening to use violence .
More bizarrely , perhaps , injunctions could be used to prevent individuals using the internet to encourage or facilitate violence .
Lastly , courts would be able to prevent individuals wearing " particular items of clothing such as gang colours or balaclavas which prevent identification " .
Jacqui said in a statement : " I am committed to doing all I can to support local communities and the police in tackling gang crime .
Injunctions will ensure that we are on the front foot in tackling gangs and able to deliver swift control during periods of high tension . "
Smith cited the experience of Birmingham City Council in using powers under the Local Government Act 1972 , which secured 30 interim injunctions between August and December 2007 as part of a crackdown on gang activity .
This apparently saw a drop in firearms incidents and other nasties during the injunction surge .
Once the injunction flurry ceased , gang related activity began to rise again .
As an aside , the Home Office 's statement adds : " It is not possible to say that injunctions were the sole driver for change . "
We asked the Home Office why it needed to add these provisions to the bill - which has already had a second reading - if the powers are already available under the Local Government Act .
We also asked whether the injunctions would apply only to people actually convicted of offenses , or whether being seen with the wrong crowd would be enough .
Lastly , we wondered how many police would now patrol the net cracking down on gang - related social networking , and whether those same coppers would also be the style arbiters deciding what constitutes gang - related apparel .
We 'll let you know when they get back to us .
In the meantime , the government hopes to get the injunctions plan operational by April 2010 . ®
From Internet flame wars to reality TV , from road rage to the tabloids , anger is playing an ever increasing role in our society .
Whether this is because communication is breaking down , social etiquette is being phased out or assholes are just breeding more often , anger seems to be on the upswing , and scientists are furiously scrambling to find out why .
Here 's a little of what they 've got so far :
5 Dickheads First
Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Bangor University 's School of Psychology has spent a good deal of time researching the reason why so much more energy seems channeled into anger instead of happiness , and why angry people get more attention than the positive ones .
For an example , just look to the comments section of most websites :
You 'll generally see a lot of positivity there at first , but little by little , it will all start to go wrong .
Insulting comments start to crop up , and they are responded to -- again insultingly - - until the whole thing devolves into a giant pantie - fight over minor technicalities and personal opinions .
" It 's ' there , ' not " their , ' and there 's no " the " in front of " Watchmen " and RRRAARGHAAAAAAHHHH !!!
I AM THE GOD OF HELLFIRE !!! "
But it 's not entirely the Internet 's fault .
When the Bangor scientists studied the section of the brain that responds to angry , happy or neutral faces , they found something interesting :
This area is also tied closely to areas of the brain associated with survival instincts -- like your fight or flight reflexes .
When you detect anger in your vicinity , your facial recognition center suddenly lights , allowing you to better detect possible threats .
Or , as one researcher puts it , " The ability to remember who is angry may have been of evolutionary importance in enabling us to respond to a threat situation .
Remembering who 's happy is less important as it bears no relation to our own immediate safety . "
As a side effect of this -- our brains being wired to pay more attention to anger -- any pissed off dickhead who is otherwise irrelevant , will still seem much more important to you than a reasonable person who should otherwise take priority .
It 's not necessarily the case that there is more negativity , it 's just that you pay more attention to it .
So basically , the concept that " all you need is love " has officially been disproven by our very genetics .
Sorry , hippies , but the brain has spoken : Impending punches are just flat out more important than Eskimo kisses .

My two favorite quotes

One of Einstein 's colleagues asked him for his telephone number one day .
Einstein reached for a telephone directory and looked it up .
" You do n't remember your own number ? " the man asked , startled .
" No , " Einstein answered .
" Why should I memorize something I can so easily get from a book ? "
I realize I ’m setting myself up here …
But this is too amusing to pass up .
Here ’s a billboard seen in Australia :

So I have to wonder : what is the question ?
Make me laugh .

I do n't usually do beer reviews on this blog , but I got " reviewer copies " of the BrewDog Paradox Smokehead and Isle of Arran , and thought they were worth writing about .
Contrary to what you might think , this does n't mean breweries have suddenly started to send me their beers , clamouring for me to review them .
BrewDog sent them to Knut Albert , who kindly passed them on to me .
BrewDog , for those unfamiliar with them , is a small Scottish brewery started in 2007 that very quickly managed to become highly respected in beer enthusiast circles .
They 've achieved this through a combination of effective marketing , the excellence of their beers , and being the first UK brewery ( that I know of , at least ) to really run with the concept of a modern US - style microbrewery producing innovative , bold beers .
I tend to think that they 've found a vacant niche because , unusually , their beers have very quickly become available all over the Nordic countries ( except , predictably , Norway ) and even in the UK .
The two beers
Paradox is not a single beer , but a series of different beers based on the same concept : maturing an imperial stout in whisky casks .
The idea being that the beer will take on flavour both from the wood in the cask itself and from the whisky still soaked up in it .
This is a fairly recent idea , but BrewDog are not the only brewery to have done this .
Another well - known beer of the same type is Fuller 's Reserve , and there are others as well .
One thing that 's unique about the Paradox series , however , is that different batches have used casks from different whisky distilleries .
So far there are some 20 beers in this series , all based on different whiskies .
At this point I must confess to being , quite frankly , not very fond of whisky , following some unfortunate experiences in my youth .
My knowledge of whisky is therefore very limited , and , on the face of it , these beers probably should n't appeal to me since their selling point is the added whisky taste .
But , let 's see .
The Isle of Arran version ( batch # 016 ) uses whisky from the Isle of Arran Distillery , the newest Scottish distillery , opened in 1995 , and one of the few that are still independent .
Of the two , I imagine this is the one that is the closest to the taste of the original Rip Tide imperial stout that went into the casks .
In fact , there is very little whisky taste here at all .
It looks like a normal imperial stout , and it smells that way , too : milky , roasty chocolate with some alcoholic traces .
The initial taste is much the same : dry - sweetish chocolatey and roasty with milky licorice notes .
The only surprise is a powerful salty tang , which is probably there in the original beer .
There is a nice alcohol heat in the mouth , and overall the beer feels full , smooth , and clean .
The aftertaste is dryish roasty licorice , which is again normal for an imperial stout .
However , it leaves a faint lingering alcoholic whisky taste , which is the only definite trace I can make out of the whisky .
I 'm not sure why this is so .
Maybe Isle of Arran whisky is incredibly bland ?
Maybe they cleaned the casks too thoroughly ?
One whisky expert suggested the reason might be that since Isle of Arran is so new , the whisky probably has n't soaked the wood in the casks as much as in the casks from older distilleries .
I really do n't know .
In any case , if you 're not very fond of whisky , but do like your imperial stout , this is the Paradox beer to go for .
It 's an excellent imperial stout , round and smooth ( no doubt helped by being matured in casks ) , and deliciously sippable .
It 's a real shame that these beers are not to be had in Norway .
I gave it 4.0 out of 5.0 on the RateBeer scale , which is a very high score .
In fact , it 's in the top 75 out of 2500 ratings .
Highly recommended !
On RateBeer it 's at 96 % , which again is very good .
Smokehead
The Smokehead is based on Islay whisky ( nothing is said about which one ) , which even I know is supposed to be characteristically smoky .
Which is promising , because I 'm a real sucker for smoky beers .
Smokehead , in fact , could be my middle name .
So how is the beer ?
It looks exactly like its brother , but the aroma makes it clear that this is not the same beer at all .
Intense smoky charcoal fumes rise from the beer , accompanied by notes of peat and chocolate .
Lovely .
The taste has the same salty - sweetness from the Isle of Arran , but is full of smoky burnt chocolate with alcoholic whisky and charcoal notes .
So here the whisky has clearly made a deep impression on the beer .
It feels a bit thinner in body than the Isle of Arran , but has the same alcohol heat and smooth , clean mouthfeel .
The aftertaste is lovely dry smoky whisky with a long lingering end of bitter wood and charcoal with some salmiak licorice .
Overall very nice .
Sippable , interesting , complex , smoky .
Yum yum .
Clearly , cask - matured imperial stout has something to be said for it , and the combination with whisky is more than a mere gimmick , really adding something valuable to the beer .
It helps , of course , that the underlying beer is a real high - quality stout .
Of the two beers , I actually like the Smokehead the best , because it is more complex and interesting , but both are very fine beers .
The rating came out the same , at 4.0 out of 5.0 on the RateBeer scale , but I still think the Smokehead has a slight edge .
On RateBeer it 's at 98 % , a bit higher than the Isle of Arran .
My girlfriend 's opinion is rather different .
She asked for a taste of the Smokehead , but rejected it outright .
Too powerful , too alcoholic , too much smoke .
Pepper mackerel , was how she described the taste .
Well , so much the better , because then I got all of it for myself .
Thank you , Knut Albert !

Britain is demanding its Nato allies " step up to the plate " and commit troops to fighting the Taliban insurgency in Afghanistan .
Britain's Nato allies should " step up to the plate " by committing more troops to fight the Taliban in Afghanistan , John Hutton said this morning .
UK and US officials have been holding behind - closed - doors talks about a lack of manpower for weeks , and the Ministry of Defence ( MoD ) has now gone public with its concerns .
It wants troops from other , particularly European , Nato countries to be deployed to Afghanistan as soon as possible .
" Soft power is not going to beat al - Qaida and the Taliban .
We do n't have the right logistics , we do n't have the right support package , " Mr Hutton said at a Whitehall briefing this morning .
Mr Hutton is due to give a speech later today where he will underline the need for Nato reinforcements in Afghanistan , eight years after a US - led coalition toppled the Taliban regime .
" I hope my speech will have an effect with the Europeans .
It is not right for the Americans to do all the heavy lifting , " the defence secretary continued .
" Nato has to stand together .
We do not believe at the moment Nato members are doing this efficiently and effectively . "
Deputy chief of defence staff Lieutenant General Peter Wall said the impact of additional troops would allow the army " to sustain multiple lines of operations concurrently " .
" We really want to increase our tempo and the way we want to do that is to have more working points , " he explained .
UK forces are expected to withdraw from Iraq by the second half of this year as they end their overwatch responsibilities for Iraqi security forces in the south of the country .
It is not yet clear how many will be immediately redeployed to Afghanistan , where Britain currently has around 8,000 personnel in active service .
Since the 2001 invasion of Afghanistan 139 UK servicemen and women have been killed in theatre , while the death - toll from the Iraq war stands at 178 .
The Supreme Court narrowed the scope of the Voting Rights
Act this week when it ruled that it does not require states to create so - called crossover districts .
The regrettable 5 - to - 4 ruling overturns two of the act ’s central goals : protecting minority voting rights and moving the nation toward a more colorblind future .
In crossover districts , minorities are not a majority , but they have enough voting power that they stand a good chance of electing a candidate of their choosing .
When North Carolina redrew its district lines in 2003 , it created a district with a roughly 39 percent black voting - age population .
In doing so , the line - drawers divided a county into two districts , something the state constitution prohibited .
But the state argued that the Voting Rights
Act required it to create the district , in which minorities would be a large part of the electorate though not a majority .
The county sued , arguing that the Voting Rights
Act does not require the creation of districts in which minorities are less than 50 percent of the voting - age population .
Justice Anthony Kennedy , who wrote the opinion that controlled the outcome , stated that the act is concerned only with creating districts in which minorities are a majority .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- President Barack Obama addressed Congress shortly after 9 p.m. Tuesday , but a casual viewer might have believed it was actually morning in America .
President Obama takes a page from Ronald Reagan 's playbook in his speech to Congress .
" Morning in America " was the theme of Ronald Reagan 's 1984 re-election campaign , and it was front and center in Obama 's most critical event since Inauguration Day .
The president who has pledged to reverse much of Reagan 's economic revolution took a page from the 40th president 's playbook in his 52 - minute speech , striking a defiantly optimistic tone that belied the nation 's sour mood and rebutted critics who have accused him of intentionally talking down the economy for short - term political gain .
" Though we are living through difficult and uncertain times , tonight I want every American to know this :
We will rebuild , we will recover and the United States of America will emerge stronger than before , " Obama declared to a thunderous round of applause from a packed House chamber .
See video highlights of the speech , issue by issue »
Delivered against a backdrop of dismal economic news and with polls showing overwhelming majorities of Americans believing the country is on the wrong track , Obama 's first speech to Congress amounted to a political tour de force .
He proposed what many claim is a complete overhaul of the country 's economic foundation while ripping his conservative predecessors for transferring " wealth to the wealthy " and gutting regulations " for the sake of a quick profit at the expense of a healthy market . "
And he did it while employing some of Reagan 's favorite rhetorical tools .
Obama stuck to a fairly short list of priorities while invoking traditional American values of responsibility , hard work and thrift to pound home a back - to - basics message .
iReport.com : ' Obama just replaced Reagan '
" A generosity , a resilience , a decency and a determination that perseveres ; a willingness to take responsibility for our future and for posterity ...
Those qualities that have made America the greatest force of progress and prosperity in human history we still possess in ample measure , " he said .
It is time , he declared , to " summon that enduring spirit of an America that does not quit . "
Ideological differences aside , the nation 's 44th president has made no secret of his admiration for his Republican predecessor .
" Ronald Reagan changed the trajectory of America in a way that Richard Nixon did not , and a way that Bill Clinton did not , " Obama argued at the start of last year 's Democratic primaries .
Reagan , Obama said , knew that Americans " want clarity .
We want optimism .
We want a return to that sense of dynamism and entrepreneurship that [ has ] been missing . "
Tuesday night 's speech featured all of those elements .
" The answers to our problems do n't lie beyond our reach .
They exist ... in the imaginations of our entrepreneurs and the pride of the hardest - working people on Earth , " Obama said .
What did you think of the speech ?
Rate it through our CNN report card »
The president 's agenda as defined in his address to Congress may have been the most ambitious in a generation or even two , but it was also easily boiled down to a few bullet points : restore financial stability , strengthen education and promote energy independence and health care reform .
It was , in many ways , the mirror image of 1981 , when a newly inaugurated Reagan used the combination of stagnating economic growth and skyrocketing inflation to promote an equally ambitious , simple agenda : cut taxes , shrink government and build up the defense budget .
" You never want a serious crisis to go to waste , " White House Chief of Staff Rahm Emanuel said shortly after the election in November .
In fact , Obama 's team believes that their boss has already trumped both the Great Communicator and Obama 's immediate Democratic predecessor .
Reagan did n't get his economic agenda passed until summer 1981 , a senior White House official noted before the speech Tuesday .
And when then - President Bill Clinton delivered his first speech to a joint session of Congress in 1993 , he had only passed the Family and Medical Leave Act and was struggling politically because of the gays - in - the - military flap .
In contrast , Obama has already signed into law a sweeping $ 787 billion economic plan , an expansion of children 's health insurance coverage and pay equity legislation .
The senior official boasted that Obama has " gotten more done in 30 days ... than any modern president . "
When he took office in 1981 , Reagan said , " Government is not the solution to our problem ; government is the problem . "
Obama 's response came Tuesday night : " I reject the view that says our problems will simply take care of themselves , that says government has no role in laying the foundation for our common prosperity . "
It is morning in America again .
A new day has clearly dawned .

Suspicious teacher exposes double life of girl , 15 , earning £ 100,000 a year as an upmarket prostitute
The schoolgirl earned almost £ 100,000 a year working as a prostitute ( file picture )
A 15 - year - old schoolgirl earned almost £ 100,000 a year working as a high - class prostitute , it was revealed yesterday .
By day the teenager attended classes but at night she was regularly paid hundreds of pounds for sex .
The girl , who cannot be identified because of her age , is believed to have been working for an escort agency based in Newcastle .
She lied about her age before going on to earn £ 1,700 a week , meeting dozens of men on school nights and at the weekend .
Her double life was exposed in November when a suspicious teacher searched her schoolbag and found condoms , a card with the name of her pimp and details of the agency she worked for .
The school alerted police and officers later searched the £ 200,000 family home in South Tyneside , finding £ 8,060 in cash hidden in the loft , a court heard .
Detectives believe she was paid £ 14,000 in just two months but have not been able to recover the remaining £ 6,000 .
Her parents , aged 44 and 46 , were originally arrested on suspicion of inciting child prostitution but have since been released without charge .
The £ 8,000 found by police was confiscated under the Proceeds of Crime Act during a brief hearing at South Tyneside Magistrates ' Court on February 13 .
Asa Anderson , from Northumbria Police , told the court : ' The money was seized after police received a phone call from a school where a teacher found a pupil 's bag .
The bag was found containing certain items . '
The girl , from Eastern Europe , is now being cared for by child protection agencies .
She is understood to have arrived in the UK with her mother in the past few years .
' Prostitute ' :
The 15 - year - old girl , who had lied about her age , is believed to have made more than £ 1,700 every weekend working for an escort agency
Police sources said she looked older than 15 and was able to dupe the escort agency into believing she was 18 .
The identity of the agency involved has not been revealed and police are still investigating .
Had she not been caught she would have gone on to earn £ 84,000 in a single year .
And police believe her earning potential would have risen over £ 100,000 through entertaining more clients as she grew older .
A report published by Save the Children in 2007 claimed there were approximately 5,000 child prostitutes in the UK - 75 per cent of them girls .
They and other charities have repeatedly urged the Government to do more to crackdown on the rising number of child sex slaves in the UK and Western Europe .
Last night Michelle Elliott , from children 's charity Kidscape , said : ' This is absolutely shocking .
I feel desperately sorry for the girl involved .
She is , like the others , a victim .
' As a parent you would think that you would know if your daughter was working as a prostitute or not .
Clearly , this young girl managed to hide this from her parents very well .'
She added : ' It does make you wonder what her motivation was for selling herself .
Was it to get nice things ?
Was it to get enough money to leave home ?
' Was it because she was abused herself as many prostitutes have been ?
She would clearly have continued working as an escort had she not been caught .
At such a young age she thinks that selling herself is the way to get fame , fortune and love .
' There are probably many more cases out there like this one . '
Wendy Shepherd , children 's service manager for Barnardo 's Sexual Exploitation Children Outreach Services , said many young children are being abused .
' It is not unusual that young people are coerced and groomed into sexually exploitative relationships and they do n't always understand fully what is happening , ' she said .

Confirming the worst

" We 're not going to have any personal attacks on Obama , " a network insider says .

McCain Won the Debate , but the Drive - Bys ( Even Fox ) Deny Reality
October 16 , 2008
BEGIN TRANSCRIPT
RUSH : I watched the debate last night , as everybody did , and I 'm thinking , " This is cool .
McCain finally on message .
McCain finally on offense . "
I thought Obama looked like he was stumbling around .
I thought Obama looked off his game .
I thought Obama was totally on defense .
I did not see somebody cool .
I did not see a mountain .
I did not see somebody elegant .
I did n't see any of that .
I saw somebody who was lying through his teeth time after time after time .
I saw somebody who seemed irritated when McCain was speaking .
I saw somebody who almost was close to blowing his cool in terms of facial expressions , and I saw the director cut away from Obama at those times so as to assist Obama in having his facial expressions not broadcast as much as possible .
I 'm getting e-mails all night long from people , I mean in the thousands , who are jazzed , finally somebody is taking it to Obama , somebody is standing up for the middle class , somebody is standing up for the right economics , somebody trying to do the right things for the first time in a long time .
And then , after the debate , people that are e-mailing me , a lot of them turned on the Fox News Channel , and they were dispirited and depressed .
They felt that Obama had found a new ally in some of the commentators on the Fox All - Star Panel .
Now , they view the Fox News Channel as their network .
They tuned in for post - debate analysis expecting the Fox All - Stars to have seen what they saw , and they listened to the Fox All - Stars talking about a debate they did n't see .
The Fox All - Stars were talking about how rotten McCain was , how horrible he had done , what a rock Obama was , how cool Obama was , how elegant Obama was .
I got a note from a friend who watched this in a bar with 200 people last night , and they were cheering themselves crazy during the debate last night .
One of these guys happened to e-mail a friend and said , " What 's the reaction on Fox ? "
He said , " The Fox guys say Obama skunked McCain , that McCain was just horrible . "
And the guys at the bar said , " What ?
What in the world did they watch ? "
And I 'm thinking , Fred Barnes , Bill Kristol , these are the people , folks , who told us that McCain was the best chance Republicans had way back when .
I mean , as far as Kristol was concerned , going back to the year 2000 in the primaries versus George W. Bush .
Particularly disturbing to
CAMERON : Early on , they began to discover that there were these gaps in her knowledge .
I just want to rattle off a couple of the things that insiders say she just simply did n't know .
There were real problems with basic civics , government structures ; municipal state and federal government responsibilities .
She did n't know the nations involved in the North American Free Trade Agreement , we 're told .
She did n't understand , McCain aides told me today , that Africa was a continent and not a country , and actually asked them -- they argue , they say -- if South Africa was n't just part of the country as opposed to a country in the continent .
They go on to say that she did n't understand the idea of American exceptionalism , a classic principle of Wilsonian doctrine that says that the United States is exceptional in the world and has therefore a very special role in leading the globe .
RUSH : I do n't believe any of this , and what kills it for me is that she " did n't understand ... American exceptionalism . "
She 's the only one in the McCain campaign who did understand American exceptionalism , and had to drag the rest of the campaign kicking and screaming into the concept .
We never heard about American exceptionalism from our own party ' til Sarah Palin showed up .
This South African ...
Not knowing the countries in Africa ?
Not knowing how the federal government works ?
She 's governor of Alaska , for crying out loud !
This is just a smear job .
She is being smeared worse than anybody in the McCain campaign went after Obama or any of his questionable allies .
CAMERON : There are stories that say she would look at her press clippings in the morning and throw what has been described to me as " tantrums . "
One of the more infamous stories that 's now come out is there was a time when McCain staffers went to collect her at her hotel room and she had just stepped out of the shower and essentially met them wrapped in a bathrobe .
They were taken aback by that .
They have suggested that she 's a bit of a shopoholic and that on more than one occasion she would go out and buy clothes that to many seemed unnecessary because the campaign had already provided her with a very large wardrobe , uh , a wardrobe that famously rang up a bill of $ 150,000 , mostly because they bought extra sizes to make sure everything fit .
RUSH : ( laughing )
So this is Carl Cameron last night on Fox detailing what had been told to him .
Carl Cameron , by the way , is the voice of the McCain insiders , I should point out .
So they 're dumping on Sarah Palin , and you have to ask yourself : " Why ?
Who benefits from this happening to Sarah Palin ? "
BREAK TRANSCRIPT
RUSH : You might ask , " Why is Carl Cameron spewing all this stuff ? "
Okay , so somebody inside the McCain campaign reports it to him , but why does he spew all this stuff out there ?
I guess to have a scoop .
I do n't know .
But it 's quite telling , it is quite instructive here , ladies and gentlemen , as if we conservatives are n't angry enough with Obama and McCain , the fact is we 're going to have to defeat 'em both now , all over again .
So I 'm just going to warn you , there 's going to be a McCain - somebody , comprehensive immigration bill , which will result in the migration of more nonpaying Democrat voters .
This I cannot believe and I 'm going to deal with this as the program unfolds before your very eyes and ears today .
The wizards of smart on our side are all out there talking about how Obama 's going to govern from the center .
( laughing )
They have learned nothing !
I do n't even think that this is wishful thinking , or hopefulness .
As they take

fears of millions of dedicated fans , the Fox News Channel really has gone soft on Obama .
That 's at a time when viewers are counting on it to remain a key opposition voice during a disturbing political shift away from freedom and prosperity .
According to columnists Rush & Malloy of the This confirms an almost - identical account yourwas given Wednesday evening from a key source .
That person contends the order came from the top : Rupert Murdoch himself .
" Personal attacks " , by the way , can be construed to mean any criticism of Barack Obama whatsoever .
The reason ?
News Corporation is bracing for potentially - vindictive actions by Obama 's incoming thugocracy , especially regarding dual station / newspaper ownership rules and apparently seeks to placate the Dear Leader , hoping he will be merciful .
Unfortunately , this is a great way to send FNC 's audience running for the hills , with evening talk radio as the likely beneficiary .
Meanwhile , the left will still hate Fox .of Bush during his time in office ?
Of course not .
Then why should FOX sacrifice its entire audience out of fear of Obama 's thugs ?
What about the tens of millions of voters that did n't support Obama and refuse to join his creepy cult ?
Fox fans was Carl Cameron 's now widely - discredited hit piece against Sarah Palin , which has led to a huge backlash in favor of the Alaskan governor .
Also from Limbaugh 's show full control of the government , Democrats have made it clear they are not going to tolerate opposition voices or political dissent .
Though talk radio will have to be eliminated through a takeover of the FCC , FOX has simply decided to censor itself , exactly the way it is routinely done in communist China .
Are we still living in America ?

The two missile strikes on training camps run by Baitullah Mehsud represent a broadening of the American campaign inside Pakistan , which has been largely carried out by unmanned drone aircraft .
Under President George W. Bush , the United States frequently attacked militants from al - Qaida and the Taliban involved in cross - border attacks into Afghanistan , but had stopped short of raids aimed at Mehsud and his followers , who have played less of a direct role in attacks on American troops .
Strikes continue
The strikes are another sign that President Barack Obama is continuing Bush administration policy in using the military and intelligence agencies against suspected terrorists in Pakistan , as he had promised to do during his presidential campaign .
At the same time , Obama has begun to scale back some of the Bush policies on the detention and interrogation of terror suspects , which he has criticized as counterproductive .
Mehsud was identified early last year by both American and Pakistani officials as the man who orchestrated the assassination of Benazir Bhutto , the former prime minister and the wife of Pakistan ’s current president , Asif Ali Zardari .
Bush included Mehsud ’s name in a classified list of militant leaders whom the CIA and American commandos were authorized to capture or kill .
It is unclear why the Obama administration decided to carry out the attacks , which American and Pakistani officials said occurred last Saturday and again on Monday , hitting camps run by Mehsud ’s network .
The Saturday strike was aimed specifically at Mehsud , according to Pakistani and American officials .
The Monday strike , officials say , was aimed at a camp run by Hakeem Ulah Mehsud , a top aide to the militant .
By striking at the Mehsud network , the United States may be seeking to demonstrate to Zardari that the new administration is willing to go after the insurgents of greatest concern to the Pakistani leader .
But American officials may also be prompted by growing concern that the militant attacks are increasingly putting the civilian government of Pakistan , a nation with nuclear arms , at risk .
Mehsud a target
For months , Pakistani military and intelligence officials have complained about Washington ’s refusal to strike at Mehsud , even while CIA drones struck al - Qaida figures and leaders of the network run by Jalaluddin Haqqani , a militant leader believed responsible for a campaign of violence against American troops in Afghanistan .
According to one senior Pakistani official , Pakistan ’s intelligence service on two occasions in recent months gave the United States detailed intelligence about Mehsud ’s whereabouts , but , he said , the United States did not act on the information .
Bush administration officials had charged that it was the Pakistanis who were reluctant to take on Mehsud and his network .
The strikes came after a visit to Islamabad last week by Richard Holbrooke , the American envoy to Pakistan and Afghanistan .
On Friday , Holbrooke declined to talk about the attacks on Mehsud .
The White House also declined to speak about Mehsud or the decisions that led up to the new strikes .
Tension over truce
Senior Pakistani officials are scheduled to arrive in Washington next week at a time of rising tension over a declared truce between the Pakistani government and militants in the Swat region of Pakistan .
While the administration has not publicly criticized the Pakistanis , several American officials said in recent days that appeasing the militants would only weaken Pakistan ’s civilian government .
Holbrooke , who returned to Washington earlier this week , said that Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton and others would make clear in private , and in detail , why they were so concerned about what was happening in Swat , the need to send more Pakistani forces to the West , and why the deteriorating situation in the tribal areas added to instability in Afghanistan .
( CNN ) --
The hotel that will be home to President - elect Barack Obama and his family for the next couple of weeks offers one of Washington 's best views of their future home , the White House , and a past linked with political movers and shakers .
The Obama family will check into the historic Hay - Adams hotel in Washington this weekend .
The Obamas will be moving into the Hay - Adams hotel this weekend , aides say .
They 're doing this in part so that the family 's daughters , Sasha and Malia , can begin school when classes reconvene after winter break .
They had hoped to move earlier into nearby Blair House , which presidents - elect traditionally occupy five days before moving into the White House .
But the Bush administration said the house , which is used as a guest house for visiting dignitaries , already had events scheduled there and guests who could not be displaced .
The Obamas will move into Blair House on January 15 .
According to its
Web site , the Hay - Adams takes its name from past residents of the site -- one of whom had close ties with Obama 's favorite U.S. president , Abraham Lincoln .
John Hay , a private assistant to Lincoln and later secretary of state , and Henry Adams , an author and descendent of presidents John Adams and John Quincy Adams , both lived on the site the hotel now occupies .
The two , their wives and geologist Clarence King were a group of friends that dubbed themselves " The Five of Hearts , " going so far as to have china and stationary letterhead printed with the nickname .
In 1884 , Hay and Adams bought adjoining lots at the corner of 16th and H Streets , and their homes became Washington 's leading salons .
Their discussions of politics , literature , science and art attracted the likes of Theodore Roosevelt , Mark Twain and author Henry James .
The homes were bought and razed in 1927 , with the Italian Renaissance - style Hay - Adams House erected in their place at a cost of $ 900,000 .
It was bought by the Ieu family of Japan in 1989 and was closed from October 2001 to March 2002 , during which time it underwent a $ 20 million renovation .

Welcome To Evidence For Christianity !
Today atheists , skeptics and opponents of Christianity believe that they have the intellectual high ground when it comes to matters of logic , reason , science and faith .
The reality is that the exact opposite is true , but our churches are doing a miserable job of equipping us to defend the faith .
Hopefully blogs such as this will change all that .

After several painful hours / minutes of extensive research via instant messaging and e-mail conversations ( and Dilbert comic strips ) , I ’ve finally gathered enough data to support my hypothesis : smart and funny women who share similar interests with you and happen to be moderately attractive simply do not exist .

And this , gentlemen , is why I am on campaign mode this Valentine ’s Day .

Ah yes it is that time of year again for U.S. citizens .
So when we started looking for an online tax tool that worked with Linux we were disappointed and surprised .
We have used Linux based operating systems exclusively since 2001 .
Being able to do our taxes
Online for free or for a nominal fee has always been our preferred way to get it done .
We used to use Turbo Tax with the Mozilla browser until last year where we found that when they say it does not work with our operating system it really did n't .
Even after changing the browser identity information .
Simply put they do n't want my business .
OK .
We get the hint we will just move along now . :p
So then we tried H&R Block online .
We were greeted once again with the no Appl$ or M$ no can do screen .
I did n't let that pesky little screen hold me down oh no !
I got ready for the annual mud wrestling match with the website .
I slicked myself up really good with Crisco ... but that is a completely different story .
Step 1 : I tried the direct approach .
Just click next --> holy c$ #p !
They like me , they really really like me !!!
Thats right , good ol ' H&R Block Online works flawlessly with Iceweasel 3.05 and Debian Lenny .
I bet it just might work with all of the other misjudged and under appreciated 100 % Freedomware based operating systems folks .
Step 2 : Tell all the other Freedomware Folks about it .
Step 3 : Send H&R
Block a nice friendly and professional email letting them them know that it is ok , we have tested it for them and it works with our CHOICE of operating system too .
You can take down that amazingly helpful notice now .
Step 4 : After you are done applying the Crisco generously put on the diving mask and snorkel ... uh never mind .
:D
Get Freedomware get a life ! :)
Aronofsky has never worked on a film with Dark Knight star Bale
The director of Bafta - nominated film The Wrestler has backed Christian Bale over a leaked tape in which the actor seems to lose his temper on set .
Darren Aronofsky has described the four - minute rant , littered with insults and threats , as " reasonable " .
The tape was apparently recorded on the set of Terminator Salvation .
A voice , believed to be Bale , is heard abusing a crew member for walking into shot .
Aronofsky said : " I think he was right .
I do n't think he was out of line . "
The subject of the actor 's fury is said to be the film 's director of photography , Shane Hurlbut .
FROM THE BBC WORLD SERVICE Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
More from BBC World Service Bale is apparently heard accusing Hurlbut of repeatedly " walking around in the background " of a scene between Bale 's character , John Connor , and Bryce Dallas Howard , who plays his wife .
The tirade includes the use the F - word 35 times in just over four minutes .
' Deeply intense ' Speaking at last night 's London Film Critics ' Circle Awards , where The Wrestler was named film of the year , Aronofsky told the BBC's Colin Paterson that he understood why Bale was so annoyed .
The film is the fourth instalment in the Terminator franchise
He said : " It is a sacred time between action and cut .
If it was the first time it was excusable , but a second time that ruins it . "
He added that he did not think the language used had been " abusive beyond call " and that he had seen many worse things go on on set .
The tape was leaked to gossip website TMZ .
Sony Pictures has refused to comment and Bale 's agent has not returned calls .
Aronofsky said : " Sets are very , very high - powered places where things go awry all the time and emotions are high .
" People are out there working really hard and exposing themselves , especially actors , and they need to be protected . "
He went on to say : " Although it 's never good to lose your temper that bad for obvious reasons , we do n't know what scene he was doing . "
It is a golden rule on a movie set that you do not walk about in front of the artist during a take - you do not distract him
Michael Winner
" He could have been doing a deeply , deeply intense emotional scene . "
Meanwhile , veteran director Michael Winner said Bale was " 100 % right " to lose his temper .
" It is a golden rule on a movie set that you do not walk about in front of the artist during a take - you do not distract him . "
Winner , whose last film was 1999's Parting Shots , added : " Why should Christian Bale interrupt what could have been his best reading of those lines , and say very quietly , ' please do n't walk while I 'm acting ' . "
Terminator Salvation is due to be released in May .

The decisions taken by Mr Bush in the immediate aftermath of that ghastly moment will be pored over by historians for the rest of our lifetimes .
One thing they will doubtless conclude is that the measures he took to lock down America 's borders , scrutinise travellers to and from the United States , eavesdrop upon terrorist suspects , work closely with international intelligence agencies and take the war to the enemy has foiled dozens , perhaps scores of would - be murderous attacks on America .
There are Americans alive today who would not be if it had not been for the passing of the Patriot Act .
There are 3,000 people who would have died in the August 2005 airline conspiracy if it had not been for the superb inter-agency co-operation demanded by Bush
after 9/11 .
A British - born Roman Catholic bishop who has said he does not believe millions of Jews died in Nazi gas chambers has been sacked from his seminary , it was reported today .
The news agency Diarios y Noticias said the ultra - conservative Society of St Pius X was relieving Richard Williamson of his post as director of its seminary in La Reja , Argentina .
Neither parties have yet been reached to confirm the report , but it follows a demand from the Vatican last week for the bishop to publicly recant his views on the Holocaust .

Bishop Williamson is reported to have claimed in a television interview last month that historical evidence was " hugely against six million having been deliberately gassed in gas chambers as a deliberate policy of Adolf Hitler ... I believe there were no gas chambers " .
He added : " I think that 200,000 to 300,000 Jews perished in Nazi concentration camps , but none of them by gas chambers . "
Previously , Pope Benedict XVI faced uproar in his native Germany and severe criticism from Jewish groups over his decision to lift an excommunication of the bishop .
He had the status lifted along with three other bishops who were ordained without Vatican permission by the renegade French archbishop Marcel Lefebvre .
But the Vatican said that the Pope did not know about Bishop Williamson 's views when he agreed to lift the excommunication .
Interview with Linus Torvalds , creator of Linux
As many DistroWatch Weekly readers will be aware , I recently spent a week in Hobart , Australia , at Linux.conf.au .
The popular annual conference draws many big names from the open source world , including Linus Torvalds ( pictured on the right ) , chief architect and creator of the Linux kernel .
Linus was a Finnish university student from Helsinki in 1991 when he released the first version of the kernel he originally called ' Freax ' ( a play on ' Free ' and ' Unix ' ) . " I 'm doing a ( free ) operating system ( just a hobby , wo n't be big and professional like GNU ) for 386 ( 486 ) AT clones ...
It is NOT portable ( uses 386 task switching etc. ) , and it probably never will support anything other than AT hard disks , as that 's all I have :-( , " Linus wrote to the comp.os. minix newsgroup .
Ironically , almost 20 years later Linux supports more hardware out of the box than any other operating system and is the backbone of many corporate giants such as Google and Amazon .
At LCA this year I was fortunate enough to meet up with Linus and have a chat .
Among other things , he confirmed that ' that blog ' really is his and agreed to answer some questions for our DistroWatch readers .
* * * * * DW : Linus , thank you very much for finding the time to talk to us during your busy schedule .
It 's greatly appreciated !
I 'm sure that many of our readers will be interested to know which Linux distribution you use and why ?
What do you like about it and what do you think needs improvement ?
Do you use the same distribution for your work machines as well as play machines ?
LT : Since I only really " use " a very limited set of programs , my choice of distribution is pretty arbitrary .
My main requirement is that it 's fairly easy to install and keep up - to - date , just so that I can mostly ignore it .
And the " keep up - to - date " part really means that I want the distro itself to be up - to - date and have good coverage ( including things like making it easy to get Flash , MP3 and other plugins ) ; otherwise it would just degenerate into me having to work at getting / compiling user - land components that I really do n't care too much about .
And yes , I want to use the same distribution for my own work machines as I end up using for the other machines in the household ( i.e. kids and wife ) , for all the same reasons - I care about the kernel ( and a very few other programs ) , the rest I just want the distribution to handle for me .
As an example of some small detail that I want the distribution to handle for me , and that I want to get handled in a timely fashion : I ended up upgrading our DSLR [ camera ] after our old one was finally three generations behind .
So I expect the distro to have support for RAW format , and I expect it to be recent , and support the latest - generation UFRaw [ program ] .
And again - if it is n't , the distribution is worthless to me .
At the same time , I want to be able to feel like the distribution is n't just a random pick of bleeding - edge programs gotten out of the ' random SVN repo of the day ' kind of thing .
Mistakes will happen , but I want to feel that the distribution tries to be up - to - date without doing totally crazy things .
What that results in is that I want one of the " large enough " community distributions that I can trivially download , install and update over the net , and that is proactive but not crazy about updating .
That pretty much narrows it down to openSUSE and Fedora , with Ubuntu being a possible third one .
And for the last few years , it has been Fedora .
DW : Since Fedora has dropped support for KDE 3.x in recent times , what desktop environment are you using now ?
Have you made the move to KDE 4.x , or dare I say it , GNOME ?
If so , how have you found the transition ?
LT : Since I 'm on Fedora , I got hit by the ( bad ) transition to KDE4 , and as a result I 've been using GNOME for the last year or so .
It 's still somewhat painful , more so when I 'm on my laptop , mainly for the same old reason : you cannot fix the mouse buttons in GNOME .
( The reason this hits me more on the laptop than anywhere else is that most laptops only have two buttons , making the middle - button press much harder .
And middle button is what you need for the ' send to back ' window action . )
I wrote the patch ( including even the graphical configuration management ) , I sent it in , and it got rejected as " too complicated for users " .
Frickin ' idiots ( and I 'm not talking about those alleged users ) .
But right now , KDE is worse .
I 'd like to explore alternatives , but if you 've followed my answers this far and are perceptive , you 'll probably already have figured out that the programs involved are n't on my list of things I care about that much .
I 'm well known for disliking GNOME , but it 's not the " using it " part that I dislike as much as the apparent mentality of the GNOME people who think that all users are idiots and then limit what I can do with it for that reason .
See the difference ?
So I 'll use whatever works best on my machine and in my workflow , and a window manager is not something I really care deeply about .
DW : The release of the Eee PC has introduced Linux to an even wider range of everyday consumers .
What are your thoughts on Linux running in this consumer space and do you think it will help Linux gain more traction on the desktop ?
Do you own a netbook ?
LT : I actually took an Eee PC with me to Tasmania for LCA , not because it's a ' consumer device ' , but because I 've actually long been in the camp of people who think that laptops should be small and light and not to be used as desktop replacements .
So I think that netbooks are really just ' laptops done right ' .
And yes , I think Linux fits pretty well in that space , partly because Linux works better on low - end hardware than say , Vista , but partly because I think it 's also a good way to enter the " mindshare " for people who , like me , do n't necessarily want a desktop replacement laptop , but simply a small thing to take with them on trips .
People do n't necessarily expect the same thing out of a netbook as they expect from their desktop - and I 'm not talking about just performance .
And those different expectations may make it easier for people who otherwise are very tightly attached to Windows to say " OK , I want something small and easy for just travelling , and if it does n't run exactly the same apps that I have on my desktop I do n't care " .
So just the change in form - factor may end up being a way for people to be willing to learn something new , and thus be introduced to Linux when they might not otherwise have been ready to take that step .
DW : Do you think having so many distributions is a good thing ?
Should a collaboration effort exist for a single " new user orientated " distribution , or should new users just get used to the " Linux way " ?
LT : I think multiple distributions are n't just a good thing , I think it 's something absolutely required !
We have hundreds of distros , and a lot of them are really for niche markets .
And you need that - simply because different markets simply have different requirements , and no single distro will take care of them all .
Of course , people then often say " well , do you need multiple distros for the same market " when they think about the normal desktop market and just look at the whole issue of having openSUSE / Fedora / Ubuntu all in that same space .
But it really is n't that different - you still have the distributions looking at and concentrating on specific issues , and you do want the competition - and letting the markets decide which issues are the ones that really dominate .
In addition , having multiple players just keeps everybody honest , and allows you to compare them .
It may all look a bit messy and complex , but I 'd much rather have a multi-party system over a single - party one .
Even if it 's more complicated .
DW : Also , what barriers for entry do you think still exist which stop new users from trying or sticking with Linux on the desktop ?
Once these are overcome , do you think we 'll then see " the year of the Linux desktop " ?
LT : I do n't think it 's one thing , and I do n't think it 's also ever going to be " a year " .
It 's a combination of lots of small things , and it's this constant slow steady drive towards a more complete solution , and getting people to slowly try out something different .
It just takes a lot of time .
People often see open source development as being something very fast , but it really is n't .
Yes , there are huge developments going on at an incredible rate , but at the same time , quite often any particular issue moves very slowly indeed .
Think about ( to pick just a totally random example that has been discussed over the years ) something like the GIMP user interface .
Has that changed as quickly as people have wished for ?
Should it ?
And at the same time , quite often it 's really an issue of people , not technology .
You sometimes just need to get people used to a new idea and a new way of doing things , and that takes tons of time too .
Maybe the GIMP interfaces really are n't as horrid as they are , and it 's just people who should change ?
It does happen .
To take an example from my own sphere of development - with git , one of the biggest hurdles used to be how different it was from what people were used to , and people who wanted just another CVS or SVN felt it was really hard to get your head around it .
It used to be a constant issue that required explanation on the git mailing list .
Now , the git people were obviously convinced that the whole distributed issue was so technically superior that you really needed to understand it , and that there was no way to make git centralized to match the expectations of people .
So for git , it really had to be about trying to teach people , even if to some degree it 's much harder to change peoples ' expectations to match the software than it usually is to change the software to suit people .
Did it work ?
It seems to have .
The whole thing about distributed SCMs and how it quite fundamentally changes how you have to think about some issues does seem to be calming down .
People are getting used to git , and we 're seeing less noise about how it 's such a difficult learning model with a steep learning curve .
But it literally took time .
Lots of time .
And it 's still ongoing .
And that example is from something pretty technical , where there really were some pretty damn strong arguments for it .
When it comes to people getting used to a much fuzzier " whole desktop experience " with all that implies , it takes even longer .
DW : How much do various distributions influence the direction of the kernel ?
LT : I really can't give any quantifiable numbers , but distros tend to influence things pretty directly by simply having developers attached .
You 'll find quite a few big - name kernel developers working for Red Hat and Novell .
The other thing that distros do is to interface with the debugging : one often overlooked aspect of a distribution is the way it handles problem reports from users , and how it feeds those upstream .
Not just to the kernel , by the way .
A distribution that is actively involved in bug resolution and in user issues is very obviously going to influence the upstream project quite a bit .
Again , distributions can obviously do that well or badly .
One of the reasons I like using Fedora is that I know that they are particularly active in both having developers and in trying to also track the latest kernel fairly closely and be actively involved with bug reporting .
DW : You have been quoted as saying that releasing Linux under the GPL was the best thing you ever did .
What shape do you think Linux might have taken were it not for GNU userland tools or the GPL ?
LT : It 's hard to imagine , really .
I did have a license before the GPL , which was a very strict " give all changes back under the same license , and no money can change hands " , and the first part of that license really was the same as GPL v2 in spirit , if not in legal verbiage .
So it 's not like the GPL is " unique " in that sense .
The same goes for much of the GNU userland - there were tons of BSD userland , and back when I started Linux , the BSD versions were arguably the stronger ones .
The exception there was really the compiler : GCC ( along with the Binutils suite ) was pretty unique , and I very much recognized that rather early on .
One of my big reasons to choose the GPL was the recognition of how important GCC had been for Linux .
But the whole speculation of " what if " is really pretty hard .
Impossible , I 'd say .
A lot of the issues with license choice is about the network effects it implies - the same way I chose to switch to the GPL partly due to GCC , other projects choose their license due to what they see around them , and so you see this huge accumulation of projects around a few licenses .
And that 's not necessarily because the licenses themselves are so special , but because of the network effects .
What would have happened without the GPL ?
Who knows ?
Another license like it might have sprung up , and gathered that kind of following .
Or not .
We 'll never know .
DW : Can you remember the very first patch you received for Linux ?
Were you expecting it and how did it make you feel ?
LT : I do n't remember the exact first patch , and in fact I do remember how , for the first few months , I tended not to really " apply " patches directly as much as just rewrite them .
It took me a while before I was really comfy just applying other peoples ' changes to what was my rather personal project .
Of course , it depended on the patch ( and still does , to a small degree - it still happens that I get a patch and decide that I want to do what it does , but that it needs to be done in a different way ) .
But the timeline must have been that I started getting patches around November 1991 or so .
It did n't happen immediately after I released the first version .
It takes some time for people to look a project over and actually send changes .
DW : What are the most exciting things coming up in the Linux kernel ?
LT : The things I personally care about tend to not even be on the radar of most people .
The changes to the very lowest levels of the suspend and resume model are an example of something I look at closely and think are interesting .
Most other people do n't think that kind of thing matters - at least as long as we do n't break their laptops suspending ;)
Of the actual stuff that has any visible impact to users , I guess the interesting area is that we 're getting all these next - generation file systems and they 're going to battle it out .
" ext4 vs Btrfs in the thunderdome . "
DW : And lastly , what do you do for fun ?
LT : Mostly reading .
DW : Thank you again for your time and for all your work , Linus .
We wish you all the very best for the future !
Linus Torvalds talking with Chris Smart at LCA 2009

Note :
This article has been edited to correct the given name of Bradley Harrison .
A judge of the Ontario Court of Appeal said he worries Canadians will treat the Charter of Rights and Freedoms with disdain if courts routinely throw out evidence of serious crime because it has been obtained through police misconduct .
Speaking at a legal symposium in Toronto yesterday , Justice Michael Moldaver said it 's time for courts to develop a more " nuanced " approach to deciding whether a prosecution should grind to a halt when police break the rules .
" Believe it or not , I worry about the public loss of respect for the Charter , " Moldaver said while moderating a panel discussion at the Ontario Bar Association 's annual conference .
The Charter 's exclusionary clause – sec. 24 . ( 2 ) – allows judges to throw out tainted evidence if its admission at a trial would bring the administration of justice into " disrepute . "
Doing so often spells the end of a case .
But Moldaver questioned what the justice system and society accomplishes by excluding evidence such as guns or drugs when the officer misconduct that led to its seizure was n't standard operating procedure for a police force , but simply the actions of a rogue investigator .
" What are we doing ? " he asked .
But Frank Addario , president of the Criminal Lawyers ' Association , said unless judges are prepared to make the tough calls and throw out evidence obtained in violation of a suspect 's constitutional rights , there 's little chance police will stop breaking the law .
Instead , " the message ( from the courts ) is , ' Whenever police are going to investigate a serious crime , take chances with civil liberties , cut corners – if you hit the jackpot , we will reward you by admitting the evidence , ' " he said .
So far , police forces have shown little appetite for disciplining officers who run afoul of the Charter , Addario added , pointing to the case of Bradley Harrison , who was pulled over on the Trans - Canada Highway near Kenora in 2004 with 35 kilograms of cocaine hidden in his SUV .
An Ontario Provincial Police constable had no grounds for stopping Harrison and even lied in court about the incident , yet there 's no evidence he was ever disciplined , Addario noted .
In a 2 - 1 decision last year , Associate Chief Justice Dennis O'Connor and Justice James MacPherson of the Ontario Court of Appeal approved the trial judge 's decision to admit the evidence , arguing in part that while the officer 's conduct was wrong , there was no indication it was the result of a systemic OPP problem .
Justice Eleanore Cronk dissented , accusing the majority of minimizing what the officer did .
The case is now before the Supreme Court of Canada .
Yesterday , Moldaver said his judicial colleagues who wrote the majority decision in the Harrison case may well have decided to exclude the evidence if , instead of stopping Harrison on the highway , the officer had " busted into this person 's house unannounced and done this . "
" Maybe we 'd say that 's the kind of egregious conduct our society simply will not tolerate and the evidence is going out .
...
Maybe if the police officer threatened , or extorted or whatever , maybe we will say we will not live in a country like this . "
Part of the problem for police officers trying to stay within the bounds of the law is that the Supreme Court and Parliament have devised a confusing " labyrinth " of rules that vary according to the type of search being conducted , said Crown counsel Michal Fairburn , another panelist .

Fairburn and Moldaver said it 's time for Parliament to consolidate the rules into more user - friendly guidelines that both officers and judges can better understand .
Addario said all judges also have an obligation to educate the public when a decision to throw out evidence ends a prosecution .
In their decisions , he said , judges should say : " If you are angry about the result in this case , you should not be angry at the defendant or the court .
You should be angry at the police officer who made the deliberate decision to ignore the Charter . "
But what if Darwin ’s evidence had led to conclusions that did not support his belief in the unitary origins of mankind ?
Would he have fudged the data ?
Desmond and Moore do n’t really address the question .
One is left with the impression that Darwin was amazingly lucky that his benevolent preconceptions turned out to fit the facts .
In his lively and wide - ranging “ Angels and Ages , ” Adam Gopnik suggests that when facts and values clash we might live in accordance with our beliefs anyway .
“ It might be true — there is absolutely no such evidence , but it might be true — that different ethnic groups , or sexes , have on average different innate aptitudes for math or science , ” he muses .
“ We might decide to even things out , give some people extra help toward that end , or we might decide just to live with the disparity . ”
Gopnik ’s short book takes its impetus from a striking historical coincidence : “ On Feb . 12 , 1809 , two baby boys were born within a few hours of each other on either side of the Atlantic . ”
Those babies , one rich and one poor , as in a plot of Mark Twain ’s , were Darwin and Abraham Lincoln .
Though he makes some dubious claims about parallels — “ lives lived in one time have similar shapes ” — Gopnik ’s real comparison is between two writers .
“ They matter most , ” he claims , “ because they wrote so well . ”
More specifically , Darwin and Lincoln , drawing on their seemingly unpoetic backgrounds in legal argument and natural history , invented “ a new kind of eloquence ” that we still use for “ the way we live now and the way we talk at home and in public . ”
Both of Gopnik ’s interwoven essays , originally published in different form as articles in The New Yorker , where he is a staff writer , involve mysteries to be solved .
The first mystery is whether the secretary of war Edwin Stanton said by Lincoln ’s deathbed , “ Now he belongs to the ages ” or “ Now he belongs to the angels ” — whether , in other words , he invoked the consolations of historical memory or religion .
Witnesses reported both .
For Darwin , the mystery is why he delayed the publication of his theory of natural selection , with all essentials in place in 1838 , for 20 years .
Gopnik dutifully offers solutions to both mysteries , but his real interests lie elsewhere .
Gopnik is as convinced as Desmond and Moore that Darwin was no kind of racist .
“ The one thing that you could not read into Darwin ’s writings was racism , ” he writes .
And yet , in another sense the books seem directly opposed .
What Gopnik finds in Darwin ’s early career is not some overarching moral principle but rather “ pure plain looking . ”
What set Darwin apart was that “ he liked to look at things the way an artist likes to draw , the way a composer likes to play the piano , the way a cook likes to chop onions . ”
Desmond and Moore think the key to Darwin was the lowly slave ; Gopnik thinks the key to Darwin was the lowly earthworm , the subject of his last book .
Darwin ’s emphasis on “ the homely , the overlooked , the undervalued ” made him , in Gopnik ’s view , both a great scientist and a great writer .
If Darwin ’s eloquence rests on “ the slow crawl of fact . . . building toward a big blade of point , ” Gopnik finds a related eloquence in Lincoln ’s preference for legal minutiae — “ the close crawl across the facts of a case ” — over grandiose oratory .
In this regard , Lincoln and Darwin were “ nearsighted visionaries . ”
Some of Gopnik ’s best pages are extended analyses of passages in which Lincoln , in his great speeches , pursues “ the drill of monosyllabic summation — the urge , natural to a lawyer , to say something hard one last time in short , flat words , ” or in which Darwin finds evidence that the sexual passion of earthworms “ is strong enough to overcome for a time their dread of light . ”
For Gopnik , who has published popular books about the joys of parenting in Paris and New York , Lincoln and Darwin were down - to - earth because they were devoted “ family men . ”
His attempt to find coziness in their family life sometimes verges on the sentimental , as he himself acknowledges .
“ We want the Darwins ( like the Lincolns ) to be loving and indulgent and attentive parents because then they will be like us . ”
Gopnik may be right that the early deaths of their children , Annie Darwin at age 10 and Willie Lincoln at 11 , introduced a fatalistic note of tragedy — beyond what Lincoln called the “ awful arithmetic ” of the Civil War or Darwin called the relentless “ struggle for life ” — into their prose styles .
But it is his astute analysis of those styles that shows us why these thinkers and writers , who maintained “ a tragic consciousness without robbing it of a hopeful view , ” have so robustly survived to our own time .

Obama ’s 67 % approval rating on the stimulus is more than twice that of Republicans
PRINCETON , NJ --
The American public gives President Barack Obama a strong 67 % approval rating for the way in which he is handling the government 's efforts to pass an economic stimulus bill , while the Democrats and , in particular , the Republicans in Congress receive much lower approval ratings of 48 % and 31 % , respectively .
These findings , based on Gallup Poll interviews conducted Feb. 6 - 7 , underscore the degree to which Obama appears to be maintaining the upper hand over his opponents from a public opinion perspective as he and congressional leaders wrangle over the precise form and substance of a new economic stimulus plan .
( Recent Gallup polling also shows that a slight majority of Americans in general favor the idea of passing a stimulus plan of around $ 800 billion , a sentiment that has stayed constant over the last several weeks . )
Obama will address the stimulus issue before a nationwide audience on Monday night with his first prime - time news conference .
He will also conduct town - hall meetings this week in Elkhart , Ind. , and Fort Myers , Fla. , as part of his efforts to help sell his view of the urgency of passing a stimulus package .
The new Gallup data certainly suggest that these public relations efforts will find a generally receptive audience .
The data in particular show the sharp divide between the public 's views of how Obama has handled efforts to pass a stimulus bill and its views of how the Republicans have handled this -- a divide that quantitatively produces a 36 - point approval gap .
Some of this difference may be attributable to pre-existing views of the entities involved in the stimulus plan wrangling .
President Obama 's overall job approval rating ( 64 % as of Sunday , Feb. 8 ) is very close to his approval rating on the stimulus , while Gallup 's last measure of favorable ratings for the Republicans in Congress ( in December 2008 ) was 25 % .
These relatively positive sentiments toward Obama were reflected in recent Gallup polling that asked Americans whether their confidence in Obama 's ability to improve the economy and manage the government had gotten better or had gotten worse since his inauguration .
At least half of Americans said their confidence had increased , while only 17 % to 18 % said they had less confidence .
Critically Important ?
Obama 's recent efforts to create a sense of urgency that a new bill be passed would appear to resonate with at least half of the American public .
The new Gallup Poll shows that a majority of Americans ( 51 % ) say passing a new economic stimulus plan is " critically important " for improving the nation 's economy , while another 29 % say it is important .
Only 16 % say it is " not that important . "
Previous research has suggested that there is a sharp partisan divide concerning almost everything involved with the massive economic stimulus plan .
The sense of urgency that it be passed is no exception .
Only 29 % of Republicans are willing to say that passing a new stimulus bill is critically important , contrasted with the nearly two - thirds of Democrats who hold this view .
Still , a clear majority of Republicans say it's at least important to pass the bill .
Bottom Line
President Obama would appear to have the upper hand in the current focus on Congress ' efforts to pass a major economic stimulus bill .
Not only does Obama get much higher approval ratings for the way in which he is handling the stimulus issue than do either the Democrats or , in particular , the Republicans in Congress , but a majority of Americans agree with him that passing such a bill is critically important for improving the nation 's economy .
Survey Methods
Results are based on telephone interviews with 1,018 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Feb. 6 - 7 , 2009 , as part of Gallup Poll Daily tracking .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Other results are based on telephone interviews with 1,012 national adults , aged 18 and older , conducted Feb. 4 , 2009 .
For results based on the total sample of national adults , one can say with 95 % confidence that the maximum margin of sampling error is ±3 percentage points .
Interviews are conducted with respondents on land - line telephones ( for respondents with a land - line telephone ) and cellular phones ( for respondents who are cell - phone only ) .
In addition to sampling error , question wording and practical difficulties in conducting surveys can introduce error or bias into the findings of public opinion polls .
Polls conducted entirely in one day , such as the one on Feb.
4 , are subject to additional error or bias not found in polls conducted over several days .
In 1930 , when future Ethiopian ruler Haile Selassie was planning a lavish ceremony to celebrate his coronation as emperor , he sent an emissary to a 33 - year - old U.S. - based aviator , Hubert Fauntleroy Julian .
Aviation had come to Ethiopia only the year before , with the arrival of a French Potez 25 biplane piloted by André Maillet , but the modernity - obsessed Selassie hoped to put on an aerial display , with a flamboyant performer who would attract the world ’s attention .
Julian , known in New York as the “ Black Eagle of Harlem ” and sometimes called the “ Negro Lindbergh , ” was the perfect choice .
At the emperor - elect ’s request , the Ethiopian Imperial Air Force , which consisted of two Junkers monoplanes , a Gipsy Moth , and two French pilots , performed a pre-coronation show .
In an unplanned flourish , Julian leapt from Maillet ’s airplane , parachuting to the feet of Selassie , who was so pleased that he bestowed Ethiopian citizenship on Julian , the rank of colonel , and awarded him the Order of Menelik , the empire ’s highest honor .
Julian ’s glory was short - lived .
Four months later , during a coronation dress rehearsal in Addis Ababa , Julian lost control of the de Havilland Gipsy Moth he was flying .
As the emperor - elect looked on in fury , Julian made a crash landing into a eucalyptus tree .
The Moth had been Selassie ’s personal airplane , a gift from Selfridge ’s department store in London , and Julian was expelled from the country amid allegations that he had stolen the aircraft .
He accused the Ethiopian air force ’s French airmen of sabotaging him , but conceded in his 1964 memoir , Black Eagle , that “ a crash at an air display watched by foreigners whom the Emperor wanted to impress was clearly a disaster . ”
So the Black Eagle returned to Harlem .
For the rest of his life Julian would continue to promote himself as Selassie ’s air marshal , but Ethiopia would prove to be only a brief chapter in the Black Eagle ’s just - true - enough life story .
It was in Ethiopia , in 2001 , that I first heard of Julian .
I was visiting a family of Jamaican Rastafarians who had immigrated to Ethiopia , and while we were discussing the history of other West Indians who had settled in the country , Julian ’s name came up .
The Black Eagle is remembered in Ethiopia for his famous pre-coronation crash , and for his vocal anti-fascist stance in the days preceding World War II .
He was spoken of reverently — although some of the details of his life were a bit muddled — and is remembered as someone who tried to do heroic things .
Even though he did n’t always succeed , he ’s considered a hero for trying .
In Julian ’s autobiography , I learned that he himself muddled some of the details of his life .
He was born in 1897 in the British colony of Trinidad , the son of a cocoa plantation manager .
He writes that he grew up in a middle class neighborhood in the capital , Port of Spain , where he attended a British - administered boys ’ school .
The island ’s first exposure to flight ended badly :
In January 1913 , aircraft designer Frank Boland crashed a tail - less biplane over the Queen ’s Park Savannah , near Julian ’s home , and was killed instantly .
Julian , feeling the need to make the crash part of his personal narrative , moved it back to 1909 in his autobiography , placing himself at the scene .
I would learn that this compulsion to embellish was an essential part of Julian ’s character .
While these embellishments made it tempting to dismiss Julian as a charlatan , each time I dug deeper I found that his stories usually contained ample elements of truth .
So who was the Black Eagle ?
A serious aviator who was dismissed because of his race ?
Or a con artist , as some have suggested ?
Such blanket assessments miss the point : Julian was an adventurer in the classic sense of the word , a self - promoter who kept a toe in the waters of world history for half a century .
Although Julian had left Trinidad by the time of Frank Boland ’s crash , news of the incident influenced him to patent , in 1921 , the “ Airplane Safety Appliance , ” essentially an amalgam of parachute and propeller .
He later said his idea pre-figured the chutes used to return the Apollo spacecraft to Earth .
Later that year , Julian moved to London to continue his studies , during which time he learned to speak French and Italian ( he later added bits of Spanish , Swedish , Chinese , Urdu , and Finnish ) .
In 1914 Julian moved to Montreal , where he claimed he was taught to fly by Canadian World War I ace Billy Bishop .
As teams of LAZ Parking ’s employees have slowly , but quite surely , canvas the city , changing the parking meters to their new , much higher rates , another movement seems to be blossoming as a reaction to these changes .
At first , it seemed just random or coincidence when a broken meter was spotted .
There ’s no big surprise in finding a broken meter in Chicago–they ’re everywhere .
But the number of broken meters seemed to be increasing and e-mails and comments began pouring into this website with tips , along with bits and pieces of information .
Websites with very strident points of view have popped up over the past few weeks advocating everything from as simple as a boycott , to using pennies or nickels to fill up the meters to capacity and render them inoperable–at least temporarily .
Spray Paint
An entire block of parking meters , numbering nearly 20 , were spotted along west Irving Park in the Albany Park neighborhood , that had both the front and back of their heads spray painted black .
Once spray painted , these meters are unreadable by Parking Enforcement Aides and therefore , vehicles ca n’t be ticketed as it ’s impossible to see if the meters were fed or not .
Decals Removed
LAZ Parking ’s new decals have been removed in a concerted effort along Lincoln Ave . and other streets in the Lakeview neighborhood , leaving long stretches of meters without any instructions on how and when to feed the meters .
This leaves the meter without the proper information required by law to be an operational parking meter .
A motorist could easily contest any expired meter ticket on these meters because it does n’t exhibit the proper information .
One tipster named Brian says , “ In some cases , these decals just peel right off the front of the meter with little or no effort .
When these stickers were originally applied , the weather was very cold and it seems the adhesive did n’t adhere correctly .
These stickers just come right off .
They also appear to be too big to fit into the recessed area they are being placed in .
Yet another case of someone in charge not knowing what they are doing . ”
Super Glue
In Boystown , along Halsted and Broadway , north and south of Addison , a multitude of meters have their coin slots jammed with quarters or other coins and what seems to be Super Glue or some other high strength adhesive .
By our count , 40 - 50 meters had been vandalized in this way just in that area , with reports of this occurring at spots along Clybourn , Irving Park , Lincoln Ave. and elsewhere .
One individual calling his or her self “ Illinois Patriot , ” is calling for direct vandalism attacks to disable parking meters .
“ WE , the people , need to start fighting back !
Here are some ideas to fight back : , ” states Illinois Patriot in a communique to The Expired Meter .
“ A good shot of expanding foam should feed the meter ’s coin slot nicely .
Do n’t get caught …
Epoxy putties and VHB sided foam tapes show additional promise for field expedient mayhem and merriment . ”
Meters Removed or Damaged
One parking meter in Lakeview , again along Lincoln Ave. , was actually removed from the sidewalk by someone , after it was loosened during a traffic accident .
“ It was there on Saturday afternoon , but missing Monday morning , ” said a local business owner whom asked to remain anonymous .
Another meter we found in Boystown had the entire coin box removed .
Overfeeding Meters With Pennies
One local blogger has championed feeding meters with pennies and nickels instead of quarters .
While the other change does not register , once the meter ’s coin reservoirs are filled , the meter will read FAIL and is inoperable , cannot be fed and is essentially a free parking spot .
“ I ’ve done it a couple of times , ” says John , the Angry Chicagoan about his Penny Revolution .
“ I keep thinking one of these days I need to buy a few roll of pennies just to screw with them .
A penny , nickel and dime are all legal tender .
Consider it a gift to LAZ Parking .
No jury in the world will convict you for giving someone money . ”
And , in fact , there seems to be no municipal law restricting the use of feeding a parking meter other denominations of coins besides quarters .
“ We are finding a lot of pennies and nickels in coin slots , ” confirmed one LAZ Parking employee we confronted on the street .
He would n’t give us his name , his job it is to repair parking meters .
“ We see a lot of that going on . ”
LAZ Parking employees are working hard at keeping up with fixing the inoperable meters .
“ We see quite a few of them ( broken meters ) , ” said Reggie Johnson , worker employed through a temporary labor company for LAZ Parking , who ’s helping with the meter rate changes .
“ We log them ( the broken meters ) in and later on a repair crew comes out .
Last week a crew I was working with fixed 200 meters in a ( eight - hour ) shift . ”
Some individuals are taking softer , more community organization approach to exhibiting their anger .
One campaign at group action portal , The Point , lists it ’s primary objective as “ To force Chicago Parking Meter LLC to freeze the parking meter rates until Jan 1 , 2011 . ”
It ’s an objective they plan to meet by asking drivers to boycott city meters .
At ChicagoParkingMeters.com , a single - page website promises beginning in April , “ This site will be a web 2.0 portal for community organization focused on supporting our rights as residents of the city of Chicago . ”
Still others are just making the decision not to park in normally congested areas like Lincoln Park , Wicker Park and Lakeview .
Once , where busy streets were impossible to park on , now parking is plentiful .
It seems people are deciding not to park in metered areas .
It ’s just a simple economic reaction to the higher rates .
One reader named Mike explains saying , “ The new Sunday meter regulations are set to ruin the city .
The streets in front of our west loop condo used to be packed with cars Saturday nights and Sundays ; no more .
The spontaneity of going out to eat , shopping and visiting friends is already affected .
Thank you Mayor Daley . ”
Others plan to exit the city permenantly .
“ After more than 20 years here I ’m done , just done , ” says Chicago Tom .
“ Our condo is for sale and when it does , we ’re outta here .
In one last act of defiance , my wife is going to drive our car and intentionally get a red light ticket with photo / video – we ’ll have the plates disguised .
When the video / photo is viewed , they ’ll see my bare ass pressed against the back window accompanied a couple middle fingers .
We ’ll then drive out of town for the last time . ”

The rumors of a new engine in the Bugatti Veyron Bleu Centenaire were n't precisely what we thought .
That makes this …
Chesley What would Sully do ?
An economy that ’s shedding nearly 600,000 jobs per month is in complete free fall – just like an airplane that ’s lost both its engines .
So in this time of economic crisis , it ’s worth looking for lessons from the one man who really knows how to handle a crash : Captain Chesley “ Sully ” Sullenberger .
After all , the man saved the lives of 155 passengers on the stricken US Airways Flight 1549 , received congratulatory phone calls from Presidents Bush and Obama , scored excellent seats for the Super Bowl , and , on Monday , received the key to New York City from Mayor Michael Bloomberg .
Surely he has something to offer lawmakers entrusted with the fates of 300 million Americans .

It turns out , Sully ’s crash landing was more than just a miracle on the Hudson .
It was a case study of leadership in a crisis .
Washington politicians would do well to ask themselves one question :
What would Sully do ?
Here are the top five lessons from the crash of flight 1549 :
1 . Do n’t panic : Sullenberger told CBS ’ Katie Couric that he immediately knew he was in a life - or - death situation : “ It was the worst sickening pit - of - your - stomach , falling - through - the - floor feeling I ’ve ever felt in my life , ” he said .
But he did n’t let that fear keep him from acting calmly and effectively .
On the cockpit recording , Sullenberger ’s tone of voice is even and controlled as disaster loomed .
Lesson :
You ca n’t lead from the fetal position .
There are both Democrats and Republicans who would prefer not to have to revisit the notion of a financial rescue package , especially after the debacle of the Troubled Assets Relief Program last year .
Sully did n’t want to crash into the Hudson , either – but he did n’t have a choice .
2 . There ’s only one pilot at a time :
The instant his engines cut out over New York City , Sullenberger turned to his co-pilot , Jeff Skiles , and said “ my aircraft , ” taking control of the airplane .
Stiles responded quickly and simply : “ your aircraft . ”
Notice what the two men did not do :
They did not argue over who was in charge , or whose theory of crash landing was better .
They had only one chance to get it right , and Sully was in the captain ’s seat , so he made the call .
Lesson : Leaders have to be allowed to lead .
The back and forth tussling we have seen between congressional Democrats and the White House over who ’s responsible for certain planks in the stimulus bill is just the opposite of what we saw with Sully and Stiles .
3. Improvise , Improvise , Improvise : Sully cranked through a list of options with his co-pilot and with air traffic control .
Return to La Guardia Airport ?
Could n’t make it .
Bear right toward Teterboro ?
Still too far .
Sully weighed the advice he was getting , and made a unilateral decision , telling air traffic control simply : “ We ’ll be in the Hudson . ”
Lesson :
Weigh the options , and then move on .
Sometimes , the worst choice on the table is the only one available .
Both President Bush and President Obama have been making it up as they go along – and that ’s not necessarily a bad thing .
Franklin Delano Roosevelt once called it : “ bold , persistent experimentation . ”
For Congress , most economists agree , that means do something – this problem wo n’t solve itself without a lot of collateral damage .
4. Experts matter : Sullenberger was perhaps the ideal pilot to handle the Hudson landing :
He ’d flown for more than 19,000 hours , ran his own transportation safety consultancy , and had participated in several National Transportation Safety Board accident investigations .
Contrast that with Washington , where all 535 lawmakers on Capitol Hill have an opinion – whether they know what they ’re talking about or not .
President Obama himself bemoaned this tendency in the stimulus process : “ These days , everybody thinks they ’re economists , ” he joked .
Lesson :
Some people are better qualified than others – sometimes you ’re the pilot , and sometimes you ’re the flight attendant .
5 . Do n’t worry about public opinion – success makes for great numbers : Couric asked Sullenberger whether he thought about the passengers while he was struggling to land the plane .
Sully said , in essence , no .
Instead , Sully was focused on the task immediately in front of him .
“ I knew I had to solve this problem , ” he said .
Lesson :
The passengers – and the American people – are along for the ride .
As difficult as this is to swallow in a democracy , a fast - moving crisis simply does n’t allow a lot of time for deliberation .
Hesitation can mean disaster .
Imagine Sully conducting an opinion poll – if asked , surely some of the passengers would have wanted him to try for Teterboro , some for La Guardia , and some for the water landing .
By the time he ’d decided what to do , it would be too late to do it .
What ’s more , it ’s sometimes better to make a bad decision than none at all .
After all , maybe Sully could have landed at Teterboro and saved a $ 60 million aircraft as well as the lives of the passengers and crew .
We ’ll never know .
But debating the option any longer would surely have cost the lives and the plane .
The problem with all this is that democracy does n’t work like a dictatorial airplane cockpit : it ’s messy , indecisive and combative .
That ’s almost always a good thing , except in some situations that require immediate and decisive action .
That partly explains why Sullenberger is getting ovations and the ever - lasting gratitude of his passengers , and Congress ’ approval ratings are in the cellar .
What ’s scary about the Sully model is that you only know if it works after the fact .
Until the moment of impact , everyone – co-pilot , crew , passengers – is operating on faith .
If Sully had been the wrong guy for the job , or if a sudden gust of wind had tipped a wing into the river too early , we ’d be learning the opposite lessons now : Sully should have consulted more , delegated more , or listened to the air traffic controller .
It is exactly the same with the stimulus .
Still , Washington politicians too often feel entitled to a hero ’s welcome before they ’ve actually done anything heroic .
Sure , Sully and his crew headed for the photo ops and celebrity television interviewers – but only after they ’d saved the day .

We all need a break once in a while .
And if what you do is important to you , that once in a while usually happens when we least want it to .
There 's just too much work to do , and it simply can't get done without you .
It 's a bad time .
You 'll go later .
Next year .
Besides , you 'd just spend the whole vacation thinking about work .
Or doing work - I find vacations are a great time to get work done .
But you know that 's not the point .
It 's a marathon out there , not a sprint , and running on empty will just run you into the dirt .
Work worth doing is worth doing well , so do n't worry .
It 'll wait .
... I 've got an outtake for this week ... wanna see ?
Britain ’s Prince Charles may be a climate change champion , but his mother ’s house is an environmental nightmare according to a team of surveyors from renewable energy firm Navitron .
Buckingham Palace came in dead last in the firm ’s energy efficiency survey of 170 London buildings .
Thermal imaging of the palace showed heat pouring out of the building through every available opening , including the roof , walls , and curtained windows .
One survey team member mused that Buckingham Palace “ is better at heating the air outside than inside ” .
That ’s not a surprising result considering that the palace was built in the 1820 s –a time when energy efficiency was n’t a major concern .
The royal family probably knows about the palace ’s energy issues–last year , the building racked up £ 2.2 million in utility bills .
Insulating all 600 rooms of the palace could prove to be a daunting task , but Navitron suggests that draught - proofing the windows and adding secondary glazing might be a start .
The full “ Dirty Dozen ” list is below :
1. Buckingham Palace
2. DECC ( Defra )
3. Ministry of Defence
4. Horse Guards Barracks
5. Shell Building
6. Home Office
7. Houses of Parliament
8. Treasury

On first viewing of this ad I thought it may have been a joke akin to the Colbert Nation .
It begins by declaring that " It 's time to say ' NO ' to biased media . "
Was Fox News coming clean and denouncing itself ?
No such luck .
It was just that old " fair and balanced " Foxian doublespeak .
Instead ,
Fox was announcing the birth of a nation - The Fox Nation .
This should not come as a surprise .
There has been much foreshadowing of this inevitable outcome .
Glenn Beck proclaimed his intentions last month when he said :
" ... do n't get me wrong .
I am against the government , and I think that they have just been horrible , and I do think they are betraying the principles of our founders every day they 're in office . "
Not to be outdone , Bill O'Reilly joins in with his view of a nation that is coming apart :
" We 'd love to see America become more unified , but I do n't think that 's going to happen any time soon .
There 's a struggle going on to redefine America .
And in 2009 , that struggle will become even more intense . "
Beck , O'Reilly , and others at Fox News and across the conservative landscape , have been employing their airtime to turn
Fox into a rallying point for rightist revolutionaries .
They are recruiting " Culture Warriors " who will be dispatched to " Tea Parties " until they can shout victoriously that " We Surround Them . "
The battle lines are drawn and the broadcast brigades are deployed and armed for combat .
This is an unprecedented , and frightening , initiative to use a major television network as an organizing tool for political activism .
The sort of advocacy work normally done by independent organizations like MoveOn or Freedom 's Watch is now being conducted by a billion dollar media enterprise with a well known partisan agenda .
No matter how much the right wallows in their delusions of NBC or the New York Times being mouthpieces for the left , those institutions have never set themselves up as coordinating committees for social movements .
But this goes far beyond conventional interest group pandering .
There is a strain of hostility that runs through the conservative ranks that borders on the violent .
Just last April , Rush Limbaugh was encouraging riots in Denver at the Democratic Convention .
Now the Fox Nation invites viewers to ...
" Be a part of the REAL NEWS of America and join in the online community that believes in the right to express your views , your values , your voice . "
Indeed , the Fox Nation will be a " community that believes in the right . "
For a taste of what to expect , just take a look at the community that Fox already provides on their Fox Forums :
Tom BB : America ’s enemies rejoice now around the world and in the US .
Obama the terrorist is in charge .
Steven : Hell No! Obama is of the devil !
drwoo : MAY OBAMA ’S WIFE AND KIDS BE THE FIRST TO BE BLOWN UP , BURNED ALIVE OR HAVE TO JUMP OUT OF A WINDOW ON THE 88TH FLOOR ( SPLAT ) .
MAY OBAMA REAP WHAT HE HAS SOWN > AMEN !!!
Jim : The Antichrist has arrived and is doing well in the White House .
Say goodbye to what we all know as a free and God loving America .
Jim P : WHEN THE BOYS FROM GITMO GET HERE OBAMA WILL GIVE THEM WELFARE , SECTION 8 HOUSING AND EVERYTHING ELSE THE STUPID ASS PEOPLE WHO PUT HIM IN OFFICE GET .
LET THEM LIVE IN DC .
THEY WILL BLEND IN WITH THE REST OF THE DC RESIDENTS !
HOPE ALL THE LOW LIFE AND WELFARE PEOPLE WHO VOTED FOR OBAMA ARE HAPPY .
BY THE WAY , WHEN WILL THE TICKETS TO THE FORD THEATER GO ON SALE ?
Don Brown : Obama needs to be checked to see if he has a 666 somewhere on his body .
It is not presently known exactly what form the Fox Nation will take ( We 'll find out on Monday , March 30 ) .
As a self - described " online community " it could be modeled on MySpace , which is also owned by Fox News ' parent company , News Corp .
But the purpose of the Fox Nation is not hard to surmise .
It is just another brick in the great wall dividing Americans from one another .
It will likely tap in to existing movements like Beck 's 912 Project and the Tea Partiers .
Then these fanatics will be able to accumulate friends and form alliances .
One thing is known for sure :
There has never been anything like it from a social movement perspective .
Fox News has a large and faithful following .
Their daily exhortations to rise up against the Socialist hordes they imagine are occupying Washington could be channeled into an army that is loyal only to the hallucinatory paranoia of the Foxian mindset .
Beck , O'Reilly , and Hannity , do n't view themselves as commentators so much as they do as saviors .
O'Reilly has confessed that he believes that he was " blessed with talent " and that he is " here for a reason . "
Beck beseeches his viewers at the start of every program to " Come on , follow me . "
Hannity leads into his All - Star Panel sermonizing with a preachy " Let not your heart be troubled . "
An evangelical fervor literally drips from these would - be prophets like a poisonous sap .
So now Fox wants to start a new nation populated with believers and disciples .
The nation that the rest of us inhabit is far too corrupt and sinful .
It is infested with Secular - Progressives and far - left loons .
There is no course left for the righteous , but to secede .
The mysterious video that Fox is airing to promote the launch of the Fox Nation ends with this comforting enticement that seems deliberately crafted to appeal to lost souls : " Finally , a place to call home . "
Some time ago chromatic wrote about Modern Perl .
I thought it to be a neat idea but did not follow up .
Based on the first post I thought it is mostly about the use of high powered advanced features while now reading some of the comments I understand that at least in part Modern Perl is about helping beginners .
That 's much more interesting to me as I feel I understand that part more .
So today I looked at some of the discussion on use .
perl.org and on the web site of Modern Perl Books .
As I can understand there is a CPAN module called Modern : : Perl that would enable strict , warnings and the features of perl 5.10 .
I agree with the former two but unfortunately I still have an issue with 5.10 .
That 's probably the main difference between Modern Perl and plain Perl for Beginners .
The former can demand 5.10 on both the development and production machines , the latter has to live with whatever installed on the machines of the corporations .
Luckily in the past 2 years I have hardly seen any perl older than 5.6.0 at my clients but many are still stuck with 5.6 and nearly none of them made the change to 5.10 .
I can only assume that it is similar in the other parts of the world .
That means if I want to give them good service I have to teach them something that will work on 5.6 or at least on 5.8 .
That still gives plenty of improvements over most of the code out there in the direction of Modern Perl but it is a different type of beast .
Activision , the world 's largest third - party gaming publisher , netted more than $ 3 billion in 2008 , Kotaku reported on Friday .
Coming as no surprise : World of Warcraft , Wii , and Guitar Hero drove a majority of said sales .
On the flipside , PlayStation sold the least amount of console product for the gaming giant , underscoring the stark role reversal of Nintendo and Sony in just three years .
The PS2 accounted for $ 284 million in net sales for Activision , while the PS3 accounted for $ 241 million .
You read that right .
Activision made more revenue on PS2 than the PS3 last year .
To be sure , both figures are respectable and end up in the same
checking account .
But it 's somewhat of a stinger for Sony , who has yet
to foster significant momentum for the PS3 — more than two years since
its release — while the PS2 lingers .
In fairness , the PS2 has sold more than 140 million systems since 2000 ,
while the PS3 has moved 20 million units since 2006 .
That 's a big gap .
But the revenue anomaly is likely a sizable concern for growth ,
particularly if you 're Activision , not to mention Sony .
Contrary to popular belief , which suggests third - party publishers take
a back seat on Nintendo platforms , Activision 's biggest console in 2008
was actually the Wii .
Thanks primarily to brisk sales of Guitar Hero 3 and Guitar Hero World Tour , the company netted $ 407 million on the motion - sensing system .
Slightly behind the Wii was the Xbox 360 , driving $ 361 million in revenues
for Activision last year .
Even though the Wii outsells the Xbox 360 by
almost 2 to 1 , Microsoft 's machine carries the reputation for being the
most friendly to third - party publishers .
Nissan 's job cuts come as the firm has seen sales slump Nissan is to cut 20,000 jobs worldwide , 8.5 % of its workforce , over the next year because of a sharp fall in sales .
The Japanese carmaker made the announcement as it said it expected to make a loss of 265bn yen ( $ 2.9bn ; £ 2 bn ) for its current financial year .
Nissan chief executive Carlos Ghosn said the the firm's " worst assumptions on the state of the global economy have been met or exceeded " .
" The global auto industry is in turmoil .
Nissan is no exception . "
Sales slump Nissan said the 20,000 job cuts would be made between March 2009 and March 2010 .
Mr Ghosn has painted a bleak picture
The reduction will see the size of its global workforce fall to 215,000 from 235,000 , although Nissan has yet to say which plants will be affected , and by how much .
It added that it would also be talking to unions about cutting working hours .
The company had already announced job cuts last month , including 1,200 at its UK plant in Sunderland .
Nissan also said on Monday that it sold 731,000 vehicles worldwide between October and December , down 18.6 % from a year before .
This resulted in a net loss of 83.2bn yen , compared with a 132.2 bn profit a year earlier .
Car industry analyst Mamoru Katou said the job losses would make Nissan unpopular in its home country .
" The job cuts will hurt Japanese parts - makers , too , and in the long run diminish the Nissan brand value in Japan , " he said .
Nissan 's loss for the current financial year will be its first since the 12 months ending March 2000 .
Since then Mr Ghosn has managed to turn the firm around , thanks in part to forming an alliance with France 's Renault .
Industry - wide malaise
Most of the world 's other main carmakers have also seen sales and profits slump as a result of the global economic slowdown .
As a result , there is a growing trend of cutting production and jobs .
Since the start of the year , Honda has announced 3,100 redundancies , while General Motors is reducing its workforce by 2,000 .
Other car firms , such as Toyota , Porsche , Honda and BMW , have announced reductions in output as fewer people buy new cars .

What ’s up music lovers ?!
We are officially one third through the year , and music album releases –particularly in hip hop–have been high in both quantity and quality .
The amount of ‘ surprise ’ drops we ’ve seen already has been something special , and it can honestly be hard to sift through it all .
That ’s why we here at WUD Music have done our best to highlight some of the most prominent releases from 2015 , with special commentary on our favorites .
The following are listed in order of their release .
Let ’s dive in .
Rae Sremmurd – SremmLife
I heard “ No Type ” for the first time in a while last night , and it was glorious .
A mood booster in any situation , Mike WiLL Made - It ’s beats are designed to turn people up .
While the duo known as Rae Sremmurd ( ‘ ear ’ and ‘ drummers ’ backwards ) are new to the bigger stage , do n’t be deceived .
These guys have an energy unlike many of their older rap colleagues , and this album reflects that energy .
Joey Bada$$ – B4.DA . $ $
You can check my review of B4. DA .$ $ for Jonk Music by clicking this long ass link here .
Drake – If You ’re Reading This It ’s Too Late
Year after year , Drake earns a bit more of my respect .
With his shotgun drop of IYRTITL , he has finally been established in my personal lens as a legitimate hitmaker MC .
Right from the opening track , “ Legend ” Drake uses this mixtape - album - hybrid to showcase the most boastful rap I ’ve heard in recent memory .
It ’s confident , carefree , and chock full of lyrics ready for candid use at social gatherings ( not necessarily because they ’re appropriate , but because they ’re fun to say ) .
If you have n’t told someone you ’ve been running through ( insert your city of residence here ) with your woes , you need to stop sleeping now .
Big Sean – Dark Sky Paradise
I do n’t really fuck with Big Sean ( as he does n’t fuck with me , apparently ) , buuuuut he appears to have strung together enough songs to have a notable album in 2015 .
Features from Kanye , Drake , and Lil Wayne with production credits from DJ Mustard , Boi 1 - da , and Mike WiLL Made - it are n’t too shabby either .
I have n’t listened to it too much , so I requisitioned the opinion of a friend for this one :
@AndrewMackens @WUDmusic
I like the collection of songs , but not a big fan of how they flow .
Overall , I 'd give it a B grade .
— Sam Hoppen ( @SamHoppen ) May 1 , 2015
Sam would also like you to know how game - changing the extended version of “ Paradise ” is .
Sean goes in .
Kendrick Lamar – To Pimp a Butterfly ( By Joe McAsey )
Everyone has likely heard about Kendrick Lamar ’s new record To Pimp A Butterfly , and that it is already in contention for album of the year .
Any review that I can give for it would never be able to do it justice , but I hope to pinpoint at least some of the reasons why it could stand as one of the best hip hop albums of decade .
One aspect of this album that makes it so important is its cultural relevance in terms of lyrical content .
With an increasing number of publicized incidents of police violence against black people , race has become a huge topic .
Any given song off of the album addresses race in some way .
You ’ll find that Kendrick has quite a bit to say about race issues in society today .
Another interesting dimension of the record is its place in Kendrick Lamar ’s discography .
After releasing a classic such as good kid m.A. A.d city , it is nearly impossible to follow up and deliver .
The album contains a strong funk influence , which reconnects with the some of the roots of black music and black pride .
The genre also places Butterfly in a completely different realm from from his previous record .
He does not try to recreate good kid m.A. A.d city , although some of the important themes carry over .
I have n’t even scratched the surface of the meaning within the album , but if you have not listened to it much or at all , you need to hear it .
Even if you do n’t enjoy the music itself , the lyrics say a lot about society today .
If you are interested in reading more , you can check out my track breakdown off of the first song on the record “ Wesley ’s Theory . ”
This track manages to pack the major themes and metaphor of a “ pimped butterfly ” in under five minutes .
Thanks to Joey for this contribution .

Action Bronson – Mr. Wonderful ( By Brennan Haelig )
Back in March , gourmet chef - turned - MC Action Bronson released his major label debut LP Mr. Wonderful on Atlantic / Vice Records .
After just the first few tracks , it ’s clear that Bronson wrote the album as more of a cohesive project rather than focusing on individual tracks , even stating that “ I do n’t care about individual tracks , I ’m trying to create a complete , classic project ” .
Overall the album favors production from live instruments over computerized beats .
With production credits from Mark Ronson ( of “ Uptown Funk ” fame ) and Alchemist to Statik Selektah , Mr. Wonderful takes listeners on a journey through a variety of soundscapes .
Most of the instrumentals are laced with influence from jazz , funk and blues .
The lead single “ Baby Blue ” ( featuring Chance The Rapper ) stands out as one of the album ’s most intricate tracks .
Action Bronson tells a story of love lost , and makes his singing debut on the crooning chorus of the track .
The album features various interludes and instrumental sections that add a nice flavor to the LP , seguing seamlessly from track to track .
The lyrical content encompasses a lot of the same material we ’ve heard from Action before , from lavish adventures to boastful metaphors , sprinkled with a fair share of references to marijuana and gourmet cuisine .
The project concludes with “ Easy Rider ” , Bronsoliño ’s bad - boy anthem to debauchery and the rock star life ( “ who gives a fuck ?
I ’m a sinner ” ) .
The track sets the mood perfectly for Mr. Wonderful to “ ride the Harley into the sunset ” , closing out the album in true Action Bronson fashion .

I Do n’t Like Shit , I Do n’t Go Outside : An Album by Earl Sweatshirt
( by Laura Oberwetter )
2 years after the successful release of “ Doris ” , Earl Sweatshirt is back with the darkly minimal I Do n’t Like Shit , I Do n’t Go Outside .
Doris was by no means the feel good album of the year , but it ’s amusing samples and features , quick verses , and lighthearted beats are now almost completely gone .
I Do n’t Like
Shit is a deep , grim motion of poignant maturation for Earl .
The opening track , “ Huey ” , is as lively as the album gets with its carefree organ and bright sound effects .
Following the relatively cheerful “ Huey ” are songs like “ Grief ” and “ Faucet ” , laden with somber and distorted noise ; the tempos lumber along so slowly that it feels like these tracks could fall apart at any moment .
It ’s stripped down , letting Earl and his verses take the front seat before wobbling and wavering melodies .
The gloomy , bare music only makes sense paired with the lyrics .
Earl Sweatshirt is n’t a “ pop that molly ” lyricist anymore .
He talks about self - medicating to cope with the loss of his grandmother , the shadows of addiction , longing for solidarity while surrounded by people he mistrusts , and the trouble that fame and attention have brought him .
It ’s intimate , almost to the point of discomfort .
Although it ’s a move in a new direction from his past work , this may be a more accurate representation of Earl as an artist .
In at interview for NPR ’s Microphone Check , Earl Sweatshirt says , “ [ I Do n’t Like Shit I Do n’t Go Outside ] is the first thing that I ’ve said that I fully stand behind ” .
It may take fans a couple listens to readjust their vision of Earl ’s style , but the honesty and effort put into this album is salient , and likely well received .
Some artists can’t pull off a dramatic shift in style ; evidently , Earl Sweatshirt is not one of those artists .
Props to Lauren her contribution .
She too , is on Twitter .
Tyler , the Creator – Cherry Bomb
Announced soon after fellow Odd Future friend Earl Sweatshirt ’s album , Cherry Bomb is the most recent “ surprise release ” we ’ve seen .
What ’s not a surprise is how Tyler ’s sound continues to evolve , slowly shifting from internet rap to heavily jazz - influenced pieces .
Tracks like “ FIND YOUR WINGS ” , “ 2SEATER ” , and “ FUCKING YOUNG / PERFECT ” showcase Tyler ’s jazzy style , while the album ’s self - titled track and “ DEATHCAMP ” show the rapper can still exude the DGAF attitude he ’s been known for .
It ’s wide - ranging project , so it definitely takes a more open mind to enjoy .
Hope this puts y’all on to some new stuff .
By NO means is this a comprehensive list , so if you ’re looking for more I would check out Wikipedia .
Brennan would have you know that list does not include MOD SUN , and I would have you know it does n’t include CRASHprez .
Until next time , enjoy the Hip Hop .

The giant school of fish that attracted the attention of a pack of hungry sharks ... terrifying a lone surfer
The warnings are usually clear - if you see a large school of fish get out of the water , because sharks wo n't be far away .
However , this surfer ignored that advice and not only took his board out from a beach near the New South Wales city of Wollongong , but surfed right over the top of a massive school of fish .
' This crazy fellow turned himself into potential shark bait , ' said a surf rescue official who studied this amazing photograph .
The surfer sits on his board watching the school of fish , seemingly oblivious to the predators who are waiting nearby
' The rules are dead simple and every surfer knows them .
Do n't go out there when there are bait fish around because there will be plenty of sharks in the area who are ready to eat more than just the fish . '
The surfer was photographed off Stanwell Park beach , north of Wollongong , by the official Australian Aerial Patrol which has taken to the skies this week to look for sharks and warn surfers from the water .
Sharks begin a feeding frenzy when large schools of fish swim near the Australian coastline .
Rescuers have been on high alert around the Australian coast following the savage death last weekend of 51 - year - old Brian Guest , who was grabbed by a great white shark as he was snorkelling just 100ft off the West Australian coast with his son .
The surfer is nowhere to be seen as hungry sharks move in and get ready to divide the school
Since then there have been a number of shark ' alarms ' , not only off Western Australia but along the New South Wales and Queensland coasts on the eastern side of the country .
At Windang Beach , close to where the latest surfer was photographed , swimmers were ordered from the water by lifeguards the day before after a hammerhead shark was spotted 30ft from the sands .
It was one of three shark sightings near Wollongong , prompting authorities to warn swimmers : ' Do n't swim or surf in murky water , particularly near estuarine areas , and get out of the water if you are anywhere near a school of fish . '
The sharks continue to divide the school as they indulge in a feeding frenzy
Harry Mitchell , an aerial patrol official , said that many popular beaches up and down the coastline around Wollongong were inhabited by the predators ' and the only thing that is different for the sharks after millions of years is the introduction of the human factor . '
In Queensland , beachgoers swimming off the Brisbane coast were ordered from the water by lifeguards after a pack of bull sharks were spotted in waist - deep water .
Meanwhile the Wollongong surfer who rode along with a school of shark - bait fish managed to make it to shore with his arms and legs intact .
But officials warned he might not be so lucky the next time .
The sharks swell in numbers as they go after their kill
In a move that shocked only those people who have n't operated a personal computer in 20 years , Microsoft recently announced that they'd be " lightly borrowing " the Mac Store concept by launching their own chain of trendy mall - bound retail boutiques .
They hope this will give them a more direct line of communication with their consumers , create a concrete relationship with the public and provide opportunities for public relations interface and a slick , coherent new image .
You know , all the things it did for Apple .
But in case any Microsoft executives read this blog , I feel it 's my duty to inform them of two facts .
1 . It wo n't .
2 . That 's okay .
Letâs back up .
I think the best way to explain why the Microsoft stores are going to be a laughable failure is to answer the age - old debate between PCs and Macs .
And hereâs the answer , as disappointing as frothing fanboys may find it : theyâre just different .
Both have a place in the market , and they 'll make money as long as they stick to their rightful domain .
Macintosh is elitist .
Thatâs its thing .
That elitism may come in the form of family - friendly machines with bright colors and giant buttons , but itâs still an elitism , simply because of the level of image involved .
Buying a Mac has become â a lifestyle choice , â from the Apple sticker on the rear window of your Prius to the black turtleneck guarding you against the fog of a Northern California morning .
And that elitism is built right into the machine .
Appleâs slogan is â
It just works , â  but it could as well be â Hopefully it just works , because if it doesnât you donât have a lot of options .â 
Theyâve gotten better since the Linux makeover but , by and large , if my Mac breaks down , I tend to just drop it from my balcony and order another .
The point is , Macintosh doesnât have time to let you fiddle around with their insides ; theyâre too busy

Leon Trotsky , Soviet Historiography , and the Fate of Classical Marxism
By David North
1 December 2008
The American Association for the Advancement of Slavic Studies ( AAASS ) held its 2008 National Convention in Philadelphia on November 20 - 23 .
Over 600 panels presented papers or roundtable discussions covering more than 1,700 topics in history , economics , political science , literature , language , and film .
The convention ’s exhibit hall displayed recently published material by about 50 publishers and organizations , including Mehring Books .
A highlight at the convention was the panel on Friday afternoon devoted to “ The Intellectual and Political Legacy of Leon Trotsky . ”
Chaired by independent scholar Lars Lih , the panel presented papers by Baruch Knei-Paz of the Hebrew University of Jerusalem ; David North , chairman of the International Editorial Board of the World Socialist Web Site ; and Vladimir Volkov , independent scholar from St. Petersburg .
Attendance was good as 40 people listened attentively to the three papers .
Knei-Paz offered a 30 - year retrospective of his book , The Social and Political Thought of Leon Trotsky .
North delivered a contrasting perspective , “ Leon Trotsky , Soviet Historiography , and the Fate of Classical Marxism , ” which we present below in its entirety .
Volkov gave an overview of “ The Reception of Trotsky ’s Legacy in Russia from Perestroika to the Present . ”
Discussion was lively during the time remaining in the two - hour session .
One questioner focused on the continuing legacy of the October Revolution of 1917 .
Another raised the issue of how the history of the 20th century would have been different had Trotsky ’s policies predominated in the period after Lenin ’s death in 1924 .
Differing views were defended on the task of historians as alternatives are considered when examining complex historical issues .
While publishing North ’s paper today , we will provide further analysis of the issues raised at the conference in the coming days .
Here is the text of North ’s paper as it was delivered on November 21 .
***
More than 45 years have passed since the publication of the last volume of Isaac Deutscher ’s extraordinary biographical triptych of Leon Trotsky , The Prophet Armed , Unarmed and Outcast .
It would be difficult to think of another biography that had so profound and far - reaching intellectual and political influence .
When Deutscher began his project in the early 1950s , Trotsky had been dead for more than a decade .
But his murderer , Joseph Stalin , remained very much alive in the Kremlin — the object of a worldwide campaign of public veneration , as disgusting as it was absurd , in which virtually every Communist party participated .
Deutscher compared his task as a biographer to that of Thomas Carlyle , who had complained that his study of Cromwell had required that he “ drag the Lord Protector from out of a mountain of dead dogs , a huge load of calumny and oblivion . ” [ 1 ]
By the time Deutscher completed his third volume in 1963 , the political environment had changed dramatically .
Stalin died in March 1953 .
In February 1956 , at the 20th Congress of the CPSU , Khrushchev delivered his so - called “ secret speech . ”
He all but denounced Stalin as a political criminal , responsible for the imprisonment , torture and murder of countless thousands of Old Bolsheviks and loyal communists during the purges of the 1930s .
Of course , Khrushchev hardly acknowledged the full extent of Stalin ’s crimes .
The indictment was as evasive as it was incomplete .
But the impact of Khrushchev ’s speech was politically devastating .
The unstated but inescapable conclusion that flowed from the exposure of Stalin ’s crimes was that the Moscow Trials of 1936 - 38 were a frame - up and that the Old Bolshevik defendants had been murdered .
The thought that “ Trotsky was right ” haunted countless leaders and members of the CPSU and associated Stalinist parties throughout the world .
And if Trotsky was right about the trials , what else had he been right about ?
Amidst the turmoil that erupted inside the Stalinist parties — initiating a process of internal decomposition that led , within 30 years , to their political disintegration — Deutscher ’s trilogy assumed immense political significance .
The discrediting of Stalin was , to a great extent , a vindication of Trotsky .
In the climate of the time , the heroic image of Trotsky evoked by the metaphoric title of Deutscher ’s biography did not seem at all hyperbolic .
Notwithstanding its significant limitations — especially in the final volume , in which Deutscher pursued rather obtrusively his own past political disputes with Trotsky — the three volumes introduced the heroic personality of the great revolutionary to a new generation of politically - radicalized intellectuals and youth .
And what a personality it was !
What other figure in modern history exhibited such a vast repertoire of intellectual , political , literary , and martial skills ?
Deutscher succeeded in imparting to his narrative an immense dramatic tension .
But the drama of Trotsky ’s life did not have to be invented , nor did it require artistic exaggeration .
His life was , after all , the concentrated expression of the vast historical drama and tragedy of the Russian Revolution .
By the 1960s , the Soviet Union had lost its claim on the imagination of intellectuals and students .
Deutscher ’s biography served as an introduction to the old disputes of the 1920s , in which the work of Trotsky had loomed so large .
So many of Deutscher ’s readers then made their way to a study of Trotsky ’s writings , which gradually became more widely available .
Throughout the 1960s and into the 1970s , interest in the life and work of Trotsky was intense .
In 1978 , on the eve of his centenary , Professor Baruch Knei-Paz ’s The Social and Political Thought of Leon Trotsky was published .
Knei-Paz ’s approach to his subject , however critical , reflected the predominant sentiment among Soviet scholars that Trotsky was an important political and intellectual presence .
Knei-Paz noted that Trotsky “ is , even now , and perhaps not unjustly , considered to be the quintessential revolutionary in an age which has not lacked in revolutionary figures . ”
He described Trotsky ’s achievements “ in the realm of theory and ideas ” as “ prodigious . ”
Trotsky , he wrote , “ was among the first to analyze the emergence , in the twentieth century , of social change in backward societies , and among the first , as well , to attempt to explain the political consequences which would grow out of such change . ” [ 2 ]
As a Marxist and an adherent of Trotsky ’s political conceptions , there are many elements of Professor Knei-Paz ’s analysis and interpretation with which I respectfully disagree .
But his meticulous scholarship certainly demonstrated that Trotsky ’s life provides fertile ground for serious research .
Though Trotsky was a man of action par excellence , he was also an outstanding thinker .
Knei-Paz estimated that Trotsky ’s writings , if brought together in a single edition , would “ easily fill … sixty to seventy thick volumes — without including the vast material contained in the Trotsky archives at Harvard University . ” [ 3 ]
Professor Knei-Paz set himself definite limits — a necessity for any scholar attempting to tackle a subject as vast and complex as Trotsky ’s life and times .
He explained that his work was “ a study of Trotsky ’s own thought , not that of his opponents or followers , nor of the ideological and political movement which came to be identified with his name . ” [ 4 ]
Even with this disciplined focus , Professor Knei-Paz required 598 pages of the Clarendon Press ’s compact typography to complete his assignment .
But he still left the scholarly community with not only a great deal to argue about , but also a great deal to do .
And yet , Knei - Paz ’s book turned out to be almost the last really significant academic contribution to the field of Trotsky studies .
That this would be the case would have been hard to foresee in 1978 .
Knei-Paz ’s book was , after all , published on the very eve of an event that should have encouraged Trotsky scholarship — the opening on January 2 , 1980 of the previously closed section of the Trotsky Archive at the Houghton Library at Harvard University .
Until then , Isaac Deutscher , with the special permission of Trotsky ’s widow , Natalia Sedova , had been the only writer to gain access to this vast collection of the revolutionary ’s private papers .
But as it turned out , the opening of this archive had only marginal impact on American and British researchers in the field of Soviet history .
During the past 28 years , very little material from this vast archive has found its way into published academic work .
This drying up of Trotsky scholarship after 1978 is a curious phenomenon .
After all , the deepening crisis of the Soviet Union and Eastern Europe throughout the 1980s certainly justified a more intensive review of the work of Trotsky , who , after all , had been the foremost critic of Stalin and Stalinism , and who had foreseen the demise of the USSR .
As a matter of fact , Trotsky ’s depiction , in The Revolution Betrayed ( published in 1936 ) , of the process of capitalist restoration anticipated , with astonishing accuracy , the economic transformation of the former USSR under the auspices of Yeltsin in the early 1990s .
However , in most English - language works dealing with the history , economics , politics and social structure of the Soviet Union , Trotsky appears as a minor , and even marginal figure .
The only notable and original contribution to Trotsky studies that appeared in the 1980s — such a tumultuous decade in Soviet history — was a small monograph , entitled Leon Trotsky and the Art of Insurrection , that focused on Trotsky ’s achievements as a military strategist .
Surprisingly , this highly favorable assessment of Trotsky ’s contributions in the art and science of war , insurrection and military command was authored by an officer and professor at the US Army War College , Col. Harold Wilson .
If anything , the situation in Trotsky studies deteriorated in the 1990s .
American and British scholarship produced nothing substantial in this field during the entire decade .
The only published work that perhaps stands out as an exception , though a minor one , is a single volume of essays , produced by the Edinburgh University Press in 1992 under the title The Trotsky Reappraisal .
During this decade , a disturbing trend emerged in Britain , which consisted of recycling and legitimizing old anti-Trotsky slanders .
This trend was exemplified by the so - called Journal of Trotsky Studies , which was produced at the University of Glasgow .
The favorite theme of this journal was that Trotsky ’s writings were full of self - serving distortions .
This claim was repeatedly made without any respect for the factual record .
Among its more absurd contributions was an article that set out to prove that Trotsky , in his History of the Russian Revolution , had vastly exaggerated his own role in the October insurrection .
It informed us that while serious revolutionaries like Stalin went out into the streets to do the heavy lifting , a somewhat befuddled Trotsky was left behind in the Smolny Institute to answer the phones .
Mercifully , this journal expired after four issues .
The current decade has seen no improvement .
Two new Trotsky biographies were published , the first in 2003 and the second in 2006 , by Professors Ian Thatcher and Geoffrey Swain .
These works contained no new research , and I have already provided a detailed analysis of their work in an extended review , entitled Leon Trotsky and the Post - Soviet School of Historical Falsification . [ 5 ]
It is worth contrasting the prevailing treatment of Trotsky to the massive volume of material on Stalin .
He seems to exert a never - ending fascination on historians .
Of course , Stalin , no less than Hitler , is a legitimate subject of scholarly research .
There are no appropriate or inappropriate subjects for historical study .
But , as Wilde might have suggested , the one unconditional requirement for the writing of history , like for the writing of novels , is that it should be done well .
The problem is that much of the writing on Stalin is done badly .
Many of the works are crassly journalistic , exploiting in a sensationalist manner material acquired from the Soviet archives .
Works by Radzinsky and Sebag Montefiore provide examples of this genre .
More troubling , however , are studies by scholars that seem genuinely anxious to rehabilitate Stalin and Stalinism .
At times , the conclusions arrived at by such historians are truly bizarre .
For example , Professor Stephen Kotkin , in his book Magnetic Mountain , argues that Stalinism was the culmination of the Enlightenment project .
Stalinism , he writes :
… constituted a quintessential Enlightenment utopia , an attempt , via the instrumentality of the state , to impose a rational ordering of society , while at the same time overcoming the wrenching class divisions brought about by nineteenth century industrialization .
That attempt , in turn , was rooted in a tradition of urban - modeled , socially - oriented utopias that helped make the Enlightenment possible .
Magnitogorsk had very deep roots . [ 6 ]
At its worst , this tendency , in the guise of providing more “ nuanced ” appreciations of historical events , advances weird justifications of Stalin and his crimes .
Along these lines , in Robert W. Thurston ’s Life and Terror in Stalin ’s Russia 1934 - 1941 , published by the Yale University Press in 1996 , we are offered this appraisal of Stalin ’s prosecutor , Andrei Vyshinskii :
Thus , in 1935 - 36 , despite his appalling role in the show trials that began in August 1936 , Vyshinskii advocated major improvements in legal procedures .
Simultaneously , he scorned key NKVD practices and urged much greater tolerance of ordinary citizens ’ criticisms , so long as they did not touch fundamental policy . [ 7 ]
And , referring to Kamenev , Zinoviev and other defendants in the 1936 trial , Thurston offers this thinly - concealed legitimization of their condemnation by Stalin :
Probably guilty of nothing more than talking about political changes , these men , according to Western standards of justice , did not deserve punishment .
But they had engaged in opposition , had had contacts with Trotsky and leaked secret documents to the West , and had wanted to remove Stalin , all of which they had lied about , while proclaiming their complete loyalty .
These points provided material for Stalin ’s suspicious mind .
Why were such people lying ?
How many more like them existed , and what were their real intentions ?
Given the Trotsky bloc and the language of the Riutin Memorandum , it might have been easy for people less morbid than Stalin to visualize terrorism at work in some of the many industrial accidents of the period .
He embellished matters considerably and told massive lies of his own — but the evidence just given suggests that at this point he took steps to eliminate people who had misled him and conspired with an archenemy , Trotsky .
This decision , though unjust , was not part of a plan to create political terror . [ 8 ]
While the Stalin industry seems to be a going concern in the field of Soviet scholarship , the protracted depression in Trotsky studies continues .
This finds expression not only in the very limited and generally poor quality of research into Trotsky ’s life , but also in the absence of significant work on his political comrades in the Left Opposition .
How many of the leaders of the Left Opposition , beginning with Christian Rakovsky and Adolph Joffe , have been the subject of full - length English - language biographies ?
What work has been done on Smirnov , Smilga , Bogoslavskii , Ter -Vaganian , and Voronskii ?
There has not been , as yet , any comprehensive study of the Left Opposition and its activities .
A persistent theme of many contemporary works on the Great Terror is that it had little to do with Trotsky , who by the 1930s , it is claimed , was without any influence within the Soviet Union .
But is this really true ?
What research has been conducted into the activities of Oppositionists ?
And even if Stalin ’s repression made systematic agitation impossible , is it really the case that the Trotskyist Biulletin of the Left Opposition exercised no influence on the thinking of disaffected elements within the Soviet state and party apparatus ?
Moreover , had all recollection of Trotsky among Civil War veterans of the Red Army , within the officer corps and among rank - and - file soldiers , vanished by 1936 ?
Was Victor Serge simply exercising his artistic license when he wrote of Trotsky , in 1937 , that within the Soviet Union , “ Everyone thinks of him , since it is forbidden to think of him …
As long as the Old Man lives , there will be no security for the triumphant bureaucracy . ” [ 9 ]
These questions cannot be answered until the necessary research is carried out .
But why has this work not been done ?
This is a complex question which , I suspect , will , itself , at some point become a subject for students of intellectual history .
I will not claim to have the definitive answer , but I would like to point to several factors that may have affected the perception and reception of Trotsky in the academic and scholarly community .
Let me state from the outset that references to Trotsky ’s political “ irrelevance ” are neither credible nor serious .
Trotsky , quite clearly , played a decisive role in the Russian Revolution , one of the key events of the 20th century .
He was also , as it so happens , one of this century ’s most brilliant literary figures .
Walter Benjamin noted in his diary that Bertolt Brecht in 1931 “ maintained that there were good reasons for thinking that Trotsky was the greatest living European writer . ” [ 10 ]
With these qualifications it should hardly be necessary to justify “ another book ” about Trotsky .
One might also , for good measure , add that Trotsky ’s political and intellectual legacy , however controversial and contested , continues to exert influence on contemporary politics .
Trotsky is , quite obviously , not irrelevant for history .
Why , then , has he become irrelevant for historians ?
The conservative political and intellectual climate that has prevailed for nearly three decades has been a substantial factor in determining the reception of Trotsky in the scholarly community .
Supreme Court justices take note of the election returns and historians read the newspapers .
As Trotsky aptly observed in 1938 , the force of political reaction not only conquers , it also convinces .
The dissolution of the USSR in 1991 brought in its wake a flood of embittered denunciations of the entire Soviet experience .
The works of right - wing opponents of the socialist project like Martin Malia , Robert Conquest , the indefatigable Richard Pipes and Francois Furet ( a former Stalinist ) promoted an intellectually - stultifying environment that discouraged a serious , let alone sympathetic , investigation of the political heritage of Russian and European Marxism .
It is difficult to imagine the classics of Soviet studies that date from the 1950s and 1960s — works like Leopold Haimson ’s Origins of Bolshevism , Samuel Baron ’s Plekhanov , or , for that matter , E.H. Carr ’s encyclopedic study of early Soviet history — being written in the 1990s .
The prevailing intellectual climate was not congenial for those , like the Russian scholar Vadim Rogovin , who sought to explore , within the context of the Marxist and Bolshevik tradition , revolutionary socialist alternatives to Stalinism .
However , not all the problems relating to the academic reception of Trotsky flow directly from the political environment of the last 30 years .
There are other long - term intellectual tendencies at work , which substantially predate the elections of Margaret Thatcher in Britain and Ronald Reagan in the United States .
I am referring to a protracted process , spanning many decades , of a steadily deepening alienation of substantial sections of left intellectuals from the theoretical framework and political outlook associated with the “ classical Marxism ” of which Leon Trotsky was among the most outstanding and , certainly , the last great representative .
It is not possible at this time to offer an exposition of Trotsky ’s philosophical worldview and his conception of politics and human culture .
But it must be said , for the sake of the argument being presented here , that crucial elements of this world view included an irreconcilable commitment to philosophical materialism , belief in the law - governed character of the historical process , confidence in the power of human reason ( to the extent that this faculty is understood materialistically ) and its ability to discover objective truth , and , associated with this , belief in the progressive role of science .
Trotsky was a determinist , an optimist , and an internationalist , convinced that the socialist revolution arose necessarily out of the insoluble contradictions of the world capitalist system .
Above all , he insisted that there existed a revolutionary force within society , the working class , that would overthrow the capitalist system and lay the foundations for world socialism .
None of these elements of the outlook of classical Marxism — least of all , its optimism — has survived within any significant section of the left intelligentsia .
Even by the 1920s , the shattering impact of World War I , the collapse of the Second International , and , somewhat later , in the aftermath of the October Revolution , the political defeats suffered by the working class in Central and Western Europe , undermined confidence in the Marxist outlook and perspective among substantial sections of the left petty - bourgeois intelligentsia .
As early as 1926 , Hendrick de Man ’s frontal assault on Marxism , The Psychology of Socialism , gave voice to the growing skepticism among left intellectuals in the materialist explanation of the development of political consciousness and in the efficacy of Marxist political practice .
Marxism ’s confidence in the revolutionary effect of objective socioeconomic processes on mass working - class consciousness , de Man argued , was misplaced .
The rationally - grounded appeals of Marxists to objective class interests were inadequate as a means of winning the working class to socialism .
Many of the arguments advanced by de Man subsequently found their way into the writings of the theoreticians of the Frankfurt School .
The victory of Hitler in 1933 , the Moscow Trials , the defeat of the Spanish Revolution and , finally , the Stalin - Hitler Pact completed the political demoralization of the left intelligentsia .
The basic perspective of socialism , they believed , had been discredited .
The working class had failed .
There existed no revolutionary subject in contemporary society .
Trotsky , in one of his last major essays , grasped the implications of such arguments : “ If we grant as true that the cause of the defeats is rooted in the social qualities of the proletariat itself then the position of modern society will have to be acknowledged as hopeless . ” [ 11 ]
Just seven years later , in their Dialectic of the Enlightenment , Horkheimer and Adorno arrived at precisely this conclusion .
It does not seem an exaggeration to state that the intelligentsia was overwhelmed and exhausted by the tragedies of the 20th century : the two world wars , fascism , the Stalinist betrayal of socialism , and the protracted paralysis of the workers movement beneath the weight of bureaucracy .
Pessimism gave way to cynicism and complacency .
Paradoxically , overcoming the intellectual demoralization would have required systematic research into the causes of past defeats , and this demanded , in turn , engagement with the ideas of Trotsky and the great school of classical Marxism .
But objective conditions , embedded in the long post - World War II economic expansion of capitalism , worked against such an engagement .
What , then , are the prospects now for a re-engagement with Trotsky ’s ideas ?
In formulating an answer to this question , I think it best to employ the same approach taken by Trotsky himself .
He insisted on understanding the vicissitudes of his own life within the context of the development of the socialist revolution , within Russia , Europe and the world as a whole .
In assessing the shifts in his own fortunes , Trotsky stated that he did not see personal tragedy , but , rather , different stages in the contradictory unfolding of the world socialist revolution .
The rise of the revolutionary wave carried Trotsky into power .
Its ebb drove him into exile .
It has been many decades since Marxism , as Trotsky would have understood that term , has played any significant role in the life of the working class .
But those were decades of capitalist economic stability and substantial growth .
The class struggle , to the extent that it manifested itself at all , was kept within traditional channels , under the police supervision of the labor bureaucracies .
Now , however , it appears that history has quite suddenly taken one of its surprising turns .
The world in which we are meeting today already appears very different from that which existed when the AAASS met last year in New Orleans .
Over the past few weeks , references to the Great Depression of the 1930s have become commonplace .
It has been acknowledged , even by the president of the United States , that the unfolding crisis has brought American and world capitalism to the brink of collapse .
It is not difficult to imagine that this is a crisis that Leon Trotsky , who coined the phrase , “ The Death Agony of Capitalism , ” would have understood very well .
The old “ catastrophe ” theory which so many anti-Marxists have had a good laugh over no longer seems so funny , let alone outlandish .
Social being does , in the final analysis , determine social consciousness .
If , as seems very likely , the deepening crisis compels on the part of historians a reexamination of long - standing and discredited assumptions , and , with it , a more critical attitude toward the existing forms of society , then I suspect that we will soon be witnessing a renewal of intense scholarly interest in the life and work of Leon Trotsky .

Residents in the northern Gaza Strip town of Beit Lahiya , as in other parts of the Strip , prepared on Sunday to pay their last respects to Gazans killed in the Israel Defense Force attacks on Saturday .
The exact death toll remained unclear Sunday morning , due to difficulties in identifying some of the bodies and communications disruptions , but the atmosphere in the area was particularity grim .
Pointing the Finger Abbas : Hamas could have avoided Gaza raids Reuters Palestinian president saysm ' We talked to them and told them please , do not end the truce ' ; adds ' we do not want Strip to be destroyed '
Abbas : Hamas could have avoided Gaza raids
Among the mourners were relatives of 24 - year - old Hussein Ahmad Wadi , who was an instructor in a course at the Palestinian police station 's passport section that was struck in an attack that killed dozens .
Wadi was given the rank junior officer at the end of the month of Ramadan , bringing his family much pride .
He was married in April , and awaiting the birth of his first child .
Neighbors also looked proudly at the star on the new officer 's uniform .
" I am not a Hamas man , but I can say that he was a polite man , a man of honor and a source of pride for his family and the neighborhood , " said one of Wadi 's relatives , adding that Wadi completed his university studies last year and was considered to be a " serious guy " by his acquaintances .
Besides Wadi , at leas six other people from the neighborhood were killed , including two members of the al - Kurd family .
Another casualty was Ahmad a - Tuli , an Izz al - Din al - Qassam Brigades official .
No one spoke openly about it in the neighborhood , but everyone knew a - Tuli was an official in the force that built the empire of Hamas tunnels meant to surprise IDF troops in the event of a ground operation .
A neighbor said a - Tuli 's parents had a difficult time identifying him , because his face was completely torn up .
" His chin was all that was left of his face .
And what helped them identify him was mainly the clothes he was wearing before he left the house that the family members recognized , " the neighbor said .
One thing certain
Another resident of the neighborhood , Hassan Aruk , was also killed in the police station course .
Aruk 's relatives said that due to the threat of an Israeli attack , the course was put on hold for a few days , and only resumed Saturday , after Gaza received signals from Egypt that no IDF attack was expected in the coming days .
" He was on holiday a few days due to the situation , and then the police realized that yesterday it was safe to go back to normal , because of talks of a calming message from Egypt , and then what happened happened , " said a neighbor .
The neighbor stressed that regardless of the identities of the dead , and despite the Hamas - Fatah hostility ever since the Hamas takeover of the Strip , there was no gloating on anyone 's part .
" Not all the dead are Hamas , there are also civilians , and there are also security officers that belong to Fatah and were forced to continue serving under Hamas because the payment of their salaries from the West Bank was stopped , " he explained .
Residents of Beit Lahiya had different opinions on what Hamas ' response to the attacks should be .
Some said they wanted more Qassam rockets to be fired on Israel , while others said they wanted all rocket attacks to stop .
" There are those that say a response could be to blow up a bus in Tel Aviv or Jerusalem , and not necessarily using rockets that would be following by scrambling of jets into the air , " on resident said .
While residents disagreed on the course of action to be taken towards resistance , one thing was certain , and anyone who was asked had the same reply – could there be a revolt against Hamas ?
No way .
A front page article on the New York Times starts out with the sentence : " The budget that President Obama proposed on Thursday is nothing less than an attempt to end a three - decade era of economic policy dominated by the ideas of Ronald Reagan and his supporters . "
Not so much .
Ronald Reagan , despite his carefully crafted " small - government " image , and all of the Republican presidents after him , were big - government Republicans .
They all increased government spending as a portion of the nation ’s GDP .
In fact , in nominal terms , Reagan doubled the size of government .
His ideological heir , George W. Bush , crowed about the benefits of small government , while turning on the spigot for the largest hikes in non-defense spending since Lyndon Johnson ’s Great Society program .
This spending included a $ 700 billion dollar bail out of banks , which included their partial socialization .
So Obama ’s spending is more of the same , rather than a sharp break with the past .
Taking a lesson from George W. Bush  and many presidents before him 
Obama is using a crisis to justify doing other unrelated things .
Bush used the tragedy of 9/11 to dupe the nation into an unrelated , unneeded , disastrous , and costly invasion of Iraq .
Obama is using the economic meltdown to attempt to achieve expansion of government involvement in health , education , and energy .
The $ 787 billion stimulus package plus all of this extra spending will bring the federal budget to $ 3.6 trillion in 2010 .
The problem is that with the economic stagnation , which slows down the government ’s tax intake , and fighting two simultaneous and expensive foreign wars , the federal government shockingly can afford only two out of every three dollars it spends .
This leaves a whopping $ 1.2 trillion deficit in 2010 ( with Obama ’s stimulus package and Bush ’s bank bail out , the deficit in 2009 is an even more humongous $ 1.75 trillion ) .
Add to this Obama ’s overly optimistic economic forecast ( common among presidents , who usually want to make the federal budget projections look better than they are ) and upcoming entitlement crisis in which the Social Security and Medicare systems become insolvent , which make Obama ’s promise to eventually halve the post - World War II record deficits ( even bigger than Reagan ’s red ink ) difficult .
To reduce the deficit , in 2009 standing at an amazing 12 percent of GDP , Obama will need to look to the non-entitlement portion of the budget , which is called the discretionary spending .
The Social Security , Medicare , and Medicaid entitlement programs are examples of the government on autopilot  and are very difficult to reduce .
More than half of the discretionary budget is defense spending ( slightly less than $ 700 billion per year ) , making it a big and deserving target for cuts .
Actually security spending  which in addition to defense spending should include the budgets of the State and Homeland Security Departments , the Veterans Administration , and the interest on the national debt that arises because of such security spending  is yet a third higher , coming in at almost $ 900 billion .
All of these departments should also be cut back .
But since defense is by far the biggest chunk , let ’s focus on that huge pie .
During the George W. Bush years , even after the Cold War had long ended , national defense spending ballooned a whopping 78 percent .
Recently , Congressman Barney Frank ( D - Mass . ) made the bold proposal to cut defense spending 25 percent .
That sounds about right , and here ’s how to get started on achieving that goal .
Obama has proposed withdrawing all combat forces from Iraq by August of 2010 , but this only seems to save about $ 14 billion because he is leaving them in Iraq three months longer than his campaign promise of a 16 - month withdrawal , is retaining as many as 50,000 troops in that country and simply re-labeling them into " non-combat " roles , and is simultaneously escalating the war in Afghanistan .
He should withdrawal from Iraq faster and abandon the nation - building quagmire in Afghanistan , which is only inflaming anti-U.S. Islamism in Southwest Asia and the rest of the world .
Even more boldly , Obama should realize that with the economic meltdown , we can no longer afford the expansive U.S. overseas empire .
By withdrawing from Iraq and Afghanistan and vowing to end imperial policing and nation - building , he could scrap the expensive plan to increase the Army and Marine Corps by 92,000 troops .
Personnel costs already make up two - thirds of the Pentagon ’s budget and adding people is expensive .
In addition , Obama should make each of the services cancel major unneeded or excessively expensive weapons systems .
Here are some suggestions :
The Air Force ’s tanker aircraft and F - 22 fighter , the Navy ’s Littoral Combat Ship , the Marine Corps ’ V - 22 tilt - rotor aircraft for transporting troops , the Army ’s Future Combat System ( a fleet of fighting vehicles needed for fighting a future great power rival , which does n’t exist ) , and the Joint Strike Fighter , a fighter that the Navy , Marine Corps , and Air Force are working on together .
Although Obama ’s promise to eventually cut the deficits seems problematic with all of the added stimulus and other spending , surprisingly most modern day Democratic presidents have been better at cutting deficits and government spending as a portion of GDP than Republicans , who usually increase government spending as a portion of GDP , thus rendering their perennial tax cuts to be fake .
Because Obama has a tough row to hoe to equal his Democratic compatriots Jimmy Carter and Bill Clinton at deficit reduction , he needs to start with big cuts in the defense budget .
As a young kid who grew up in the 80s , I used to watch every Transformers episode , never missing a single one .
But because I came from a poor family , the ability to buy even one of my favorites would only happen in my dreams .
Now older and somewhat richer , I ’ve collected more than 60 Generation One ( G1 ) Transformers toys , and they sit up high on my shelves like trophies .
Out of all those I ’ve amassed , ten of them are selected as the best collectibles .
And believe me , picking only ten out of all the awesome Transformers I have was not easy , so please do n’t get upset if you do n’t see your favorite one (s ) on this list .
My list is not in any particular order because they are all precious to me .
I ’m going to leave this brutal decision to you instead .
Who ’s your favorite ?
1. Devastator
Devastator is the combined form of six badass Constructicons .
They are Bonecrusher ( bulldozer ) , Scavenger ( excavator ) , Scrapper ( front - load shovel ) , Hook ( crane ) , Long Haul ( dump truck ) , and Mixmaster ( concrete mixer truck ) .
He ’s mostly green and purple .
His purple torso formed by Bonecrusher is my favorite .
2. Dinobots
Dinobots are a group of five Autobots who can transform into dinosaurs .
They are Grimlock ( tyrannosaurus rex ) , Slag ( triceratops ) , Sludge ( brontosaurus ) , Snarl ( stegosaurus ) , and Swoop ( Pteranodon ) .
They are mostly grey with gold and red touches .
All five of them look perfect together .
3. Fortress Maximus
Fortress Maximus is the most gigantic Transformers toy in G1 ( and also the most expensive ) .
Standing two - feet tall in robot mode , he makes all other Transformers look like midgets .
Since he ’s a Headmaster Transformer , his head , along with his human ally , Spike Witwicky , can detach and transform into a robot , Cerebros .
Fortress Maximus can also transform into a battle station and city .
Because of its ultra rareness , I had to buy the whole thing used on ebay ( but in great condition ) .
4. Jetfire
Jetfire , or Skyfire , is a very handsome red , white , and black Autobot .
He can transform into a jet ( of course ) , and his Jet mode looks just as good as robot mode if not better .
I like his big red rocket boosters on his back the best .
5. Megatron ( Reissue )
I bought this reissued die - cast Megatron because of its high quality .
He can transform into a handgun with detachable scope , handle , and silencer in gun mode .
If this is not awesome enough , the gun can actually shoot pellets .
6. Omega Supreme
Omega Supreme is the most powerful Autobot who can transform into a tank .
He ’s also the only motorized Transformer I have .
When in tank mode , he can roll on the track pieces that are attached on his back in robot mode .
This toy comes with many parts , and he ’s quite bulky and quite difficult to transform , so I ’ve only transformed him once since I found him a few years ago .
7. Optimus Prime ( Reissue )
How can Optimus Prime not be on this list ?
This Optimus Prime is another reissued die - cast I bought .
The quality is just as sick as the reissued Megatron .
The main cab is the robot , and his trailer can unfold to form a base , with a bunch of other accessories inside .
8. Predaking
Similar to Devastator , Predaking is a combined form of five fearsome wild beasts called Predacons .
The Predacons are Razorclaw ( lion ) , Rampage ( tiger ) , Divebomb ( eagle ) , Tantrum ( bull ) , and Headstrong ( rhino ) .
Each individual one is a flashy piece , with bright red , orange , and yellow as the main color scheme .
The lion - head chest formed by Razorclaw is my favorite .
9. Sixshot
Sixshot is called Sixshot because he has six different forms !
Other than robot mode , he can transform into an armored carrier , a tank , a jet , a laser gun , and a wolf .
His color scheme is white , blue , and green .
Although he has six transformations , three of them look quite similar .
I still like his robot form the best .
10 . Soundwave ( Reissue )
Last but definitely not least , Soundwave is arguably one of the most popular Transformers toys in the world .
The blue and grey theme looks exceptional in his robot and alternate mode .
This reissued Decepticon comes with Laserbeak , the cassette that comes out of Soundwave ’s chest who can transform into a bird .
These pictures are borrowed from the internet rather than taken by me ( mostly from Seibertron ) simply because I never took any pictures of them .
WASHINGTON – The U.S. State Department says Canada should do more to curb the production and trade in ecstasy and other illicit drugs .
The 2009 International Narcotics Control Strategy Report , released Friday , highlights the growth of methamphetamine ``superlabs " throughout the country , particularly in British Columbia and Ontario .
The report says Canada has become the No. 1 source of ecstasy south of the border .
" Canada 's continued role as a source country for ecstasy to U.S. markets highlights the need for greater co-operation in tracking precursor chemical activity , " it says .
" The U.S. urges Canada to take stronger action to curb the rise of methamphetamine production .
The upsurge in Canadian methamphetamine production has raised the prospect of increased smuggling from Canada to international markets . "
The report cites Canadian data indicating Canadian - produced meth has turned up around the world , including Australia , Japan and New Zealand .
The State Department also cast a critical eye on harm - reduction programs across Canada , such as a controversial supervised injection site in Vancouver .
It pointed to a 2007 report of the United Nations International Narcotics Control Board ( INCB ) , which said a Vancouver Island " safe crack kit " program violated the UN Drug Convention .
" Canada should implement the INCB 's recommendations to eliminate drug injection sites and drug paraphernalia distribution programs because they violate international drug treaties . "
The report also quoted Canadian officials as saying Prime Minister Stephen Harper wanted to increase penalties for drug production and trafficking , but not for drug use .
Just knowing that this item exists on the market will make me seriously second guess driving my car anywhere near a person on a bike .
The Biker 's Revenge are handle bar plugs for your street or mountain bike that replace your handlebar plugs with handlebar plugs with a key inset into them .
The idea is that if somebody nearly runs you over , there is a pretty good chance that your handlebar is going to touch the side of their car resulting in some serious damage .
TheRecordPlayer.net said
" These modified handlebar plugs speak to the disgruntled urban cyclist .
By retro-fitting stock parts with up - cycled keys , bikers can now find satisfaction with close encounters .
This concept puts an new twist on the timeless tradition of car - keying revenge . by Matt Braun and Jared Delorenzo "
So next time you decide to cut off a cyclist while driving around down town , consider that these $ 5 items could be leaving thousands of dollars in damage on your ride .
Scam artists prosper by exploiting service for the deaf By Nestor Ramos , ( Sioux Falls , S.D. ) Argus Leader
The voice on the line is legitimate , the offer a fraud .
" The person who has called you is deaf or hard of hearing , " the operator says , and proceeds to repeat whatever appears on her screen — an order , perhaps , for 150 fuel filters or 200 Bibles .
The operator works at a relay center , such as Communication Service for the Deaf in Sioux Falls .
But , in this case , the person she 's speaking for is not deaf .
He 's sitting at a computer in Nigeria , buying goods and paying for them with a bogus credit card number .
Bound by federal regulations that established the system for deaf telecommunication in the United States , the operator , who might know it 's a fraud , is powerless to stop it .
And the calls — potentially millions of dollars worth — are on your dime .
The scam plays on sympathy for the deaf , and on vulnerabilities built into a system to help them communicate .
It 's lucrative and untraceable .
The identities of the perpetrators disappear in the Internet haze before the stolen items cross international waters .
Another less costly , but irksome abuse : Callers may use federal rules governing the relay system to force operators to read written pornography out loud .
Fees on interstate long - distance bills fund the relay system .
Mandated by the Americans with Disabilities Act , Telecommunications Relay Services , or TRS , allow millions of deaf and hard - of - hearing Americans to use freely the country 's telephone system by teletypewriter machine — a keyboard connected to a telephone — and video relay services .
In 2002 , the Federal Communications Commission added a requirement for an Internet - based system .
AT&T , Sprint and MCI are among the companies that offer the service .
Firms such as CSD in Sioux Falls , a non-profit agency , contract with them to provide the relay service .
Operators serve as intermediaries between deaf people and the hearing world .
Anyone can gain access to the service , free of charge , making it easy for scam artists to exploit .
" Most all of this fraud is coming from Internet - based calls , " said Rick Norris , a spokesman for CSD .
" Very rarely would a person use a text teletype machine to make these calls . "
The majority of the fraudulent calls originate in the African nations of Nigeria or Ghana , he said .
Half of all calls might be illegitimate Because FCC rules do not allow service providers to monitor content , there is no official tally of fraudulent or pornographic calls .
Rozanne DuBois of the Communications Workers of America — a labor union trying to organize the operators at CSD in Sioux Falls — suggests more than half the calls are not legitimate .
The figure is confirmed anecdotally by CSD relay operators , though none would go on the record for fear of losing their jobs .
Norris said that estimate is high , though he acknowledged that CSD cannot legally keep track of the calls .
More calls , more money for interstate operators Funding for Internet relay service — a total of more than $ 8 million last month alone — is collected by the National Exchange Carrier Association , or NECA , from any company that provides communications service across state lines .
Funding for other interstate relay services , such as video relay and interstate TTY , are collected the same way .
A company 's contribution to the fund is based on a percentage of revenue , said Maripat Brennan , fund administrator for NECA , a non-profit organization .
The more calls the relay service puts through — fraudulent or otherwise — the more money they receive from the NECA fund .
The cost of the scams to consumers is modest , at most a dollar a month .
But when the scams succeed , businesses pay plenty .
No way to report suspicions of fraud
These scams follow traditional lines , Norris said .
Vince DiSanto , general manager of Elite Design in Detroit , received a call from the relay service from a would - be customer looking to buy 10,000 T - shirts .
" Seemed a little odd to me .
And then when they wanted it shipped to Ghana , I got a little suspicious , " DiSanto said .
" Then it was printers . "
Elite account manager Stogner took an order to be delivered domestically for $ 10,000 worth of identification card printers , a boon for anyone wanting to print fake IDs .
In hours , an anonymous caller told Stogner that his company was being scammed , and that she was the operator who had relayed the call .
Elite stopped shipment of the printers .
DiSanto ended up putting the company 's number on the relay service 's do - not - call list .
But now , legitimate deaf users have no way to call Elite .
Bound by FCC rules to do as callers command Brennan said Internet relay providers are seeking ways to stop fraudulent calls before they reach the relay operator — at which point the FCC rules prohibit the call from being disconnected .
Because CSD is a non-profit organization , any proceeds from relay and other services go to programs , services and events for deaf Americans , a CSD spokesman said .
For - profit relay companies and their contractors receive payments for the fraud calls — CSD 's relay operation reported more than $ 45 million in revenue for relay services for the fiscal year ending June 30 , 2004 — and seem to lack incentive to stop the calls .
The only defenses against the scam are public awareness and operators who violate their work rules by alerting businesses they suspect are being ripped off .
Carol Grace owns 141 Auto Sales in Fenton , Mo. Just as she was negotiating over the relay system with someone who wanted to buy a van , she got a second call on her private line telling her the caller probably was trying to defraud her .
It saved her a lot of grief .
" I assumed he was deaf , " Grace said .
" I would have done it . "

The use of alternative , renewable energy is becoming increasingly important given rising energy costs and need to slow the effects of climate change on our earth .
These solutions may seem far off from everyday use by homeowners but the truth is that they are in our reach now .
There are many options that require a very reasonable financial investment .
Further savings can be achieved by taking advantage of state tax , federal tax , and utility incentives and rebates .
Below are the top 7 ways that home owners can power and heat their homes through renewable energy systems .
1.-
Are usually installed on the roof of a home or in a large backyard area .
Costs range from $ 10,000 to $ 20,000 .
Solar Panels are eligible for most state , federal , and utility tax credits and incentives and can help to reduce the total cost up to 50 % .
This is a good option because of the flexibility involved .
Buyers have the option of storing electricity produced in batteries or selling it back to the Utility Company .
While still connected to the grid your home always has a backup for days of high energy use and vise versa for when the power from the electric company is cut such as in heavy winter storms or rolling blackouts .
Most come with at least a 10 year warranty since it can sometimes take that long to recoup your initial investment from utility bill savings .
2.- Can reduce your bills by 15 % or more .
Smaller Wind Turbines cost from $ 1,000 to $ 5,000 and are usually eligible for most state , federal , and utility tax credits and incentives .
It is important to determine if your home is a good fit based on wind conditions , location , and the flexibility of your Home Owners Association .
3.-
These systems provide radiant heat into your house .
The typical system costs between $ 7,000 and $ 15,000 and saves about 60 % a year on hot water heating costs .
Up to 50 % of the total cost can be reduced by state , federal , and utility tax credits and incentives .
Pools , spas , heating for the home , and hot water heaters can be fueled with solar energy in this way .
4.-
These types of systems work with a liquid tube that draws heat or cooling from four hundred feet underground and pumps that heat or cooling back into the house to maintain the temperature .
Geothermal Heating & Cooling Systems reduce heating and cooling costs by about 50 % and typically cost between $ 10,000 and $ 20,000 .
Geothermal Heating & Cooling Systems are usually eligible for most state , federal , and utility tax credits and incentives .
5.- Hydrogen Gas can be extracted from the natural gas that comes into your home through a gas line .
This hydrogen can then be used to power hydrogen fuel cells and create electricity , oxygen , and water .
It is an added bonus that Oxygen , Water , and Heat are produced from this method of making electricity .
The heat can be used for your home along with the electricity .
Your home is required to have a natural gas line .
Hydrogen Gas Fuel Cell Systems typically start at $ 20,000 and are usually eligible for most state , federal , and utility tax credits and incentives .
6.- Micro Hydro Energy uses an impulse or reaction turbine generator and a steady supply of water to generate electricity .
This is really only an option from those who live by streams , rivers , or in areas of steady rainfall where water can be funneled consistently .
Otherwise it makes a great backup to the electric grid if the water utility will continue to supply water and you build a piping system .
Costs range from $ 1,000 to $ 15,000 .
You will need to find out if your installation is eligible for state , federal , and utility tax credits and incentives .
7.-
Waste wood and other biomass can be used to create steam and create electricity with a spinning turbine and generator .
The biomass you choose determines the emissions produced .
Converting biomass into a gas before combustion allows for cleaner burning and lower emissions .
This can be achieved by decaying biomass into methane .
This method is often used by farmers and those keeping livestock .

So like most grad students , I ’ve been feeling extremely retarded lately .
Experiments are giving me weird ( and quite repeatable results ) that throw a wrench into my understanding of what I ’m doing , I ’m ending up with different products from the same synthesis , and I ’m getting all types of twinning ( tropochemical , pseudo - merohedral , etc , etc ) in an allegedly ‘ single ’ crystal .
In other words , I feel dumb .
However , after commiserating with my fellow grad students , and eventually with the parental units , I was lead to an interesting article published way back in the day in the Journal of Cell Science .
The importance of stupidity in scientific research
It definitely made me feel better , and I ’d like to add some things that my dad ( who was once a grad student and is now a chemistry prof as well ) told me .
If you dont feel stupid every now and then …
1 ) … you ’re not picking the ‘ right ’ research question
2 ) … you ’re not working hard enough to get results that stump you
3 ) … you really dont understand enough about your project
4 ) … you ’re way too arrogant and belong in business school instead ( no , he really didnt say that )
But , he did add the caveats that you did need to feel smart and accomplished every now and then or else you just dont know what you ’re doing ( it goes along with # 3 )
so to everyone out there who feels dumb on occasion from their research , remember , it ’s okay !
Just keep on truckin !

Eric Holder Calls the United States a Nation of Cowards
Our new Attorney General gave a speech yesterday on race relations in the United States .
According to this article he had something very interesting to say about Americans .
Though this nation has proudly thought of itself as an ethnic melting pot , in things racial we have always been and continue to be , in too many ways , essentially a nation of cowards
We are a nation of cowards .
At least when it comes to race .
He claims that while America is “ largely integrated ” we still “ self - segregate ” on the weekends .
That makes us cowards evidently .
Let ’s see ; Barack Obama , Condi , Colin Power , Alberto Gonzalez , Eric Holder , Clarence Thomas , and the list of minorities who have achieved greatness in this country and in government goes on and on and yet we are cowards ?
When will we ever reach the point in this country where a man is judged not by the color of his skin but by the content of his character ?
We can never reach that goal as long as we have people like Eric Holder who continue to see only the darkness and refuse to step into the light and realize that Americans are , to quote Barack Obama , a decent people ?
People like Eric Holder just fan the flames on whatever racial prejudices still exist .
I am not stupid , I understand that there is still racism out there but America has come a long way , I do believe that most Americans judge people by what is inside and not what is outside and I get offended when I hear this kind of bullshit .
The names listed above are just a portion of the proof that if you work hard you can achieve whatever goals you may have , regardless of your color .
Eric
Holder would do well to remember that even as he was calling America a nation of cowards that 17,000 courageous Americans were just ordered by President Obama to go to Afghanistan to help protect Eric Holder ’s right to say something as idiotic as he said yesterday .
Okay , in my opinion , I believe weed should be legalized or de-criminalated or whatever , because there is all kindsa alcohol and prescription dope and cigarettes and coffee and Red Bulls and aspirin and hoodia and ex-lax ® and stuff that is rightfully available for consumers to enjoy in This Great Nation of Ours .
Again , on a personal note , I ’ve had a lot more problems with people who were loaded on Red Bulls & vodka then I ’ve ever had with individuals zooted on the “ Mary Jane ” as I have heard it referred to in the popular musics .
Furthermore , while I am soft on cannabis use , I totally recognize that it is mostly illegal almost everywhere in the U. S. of A. except in California , where I have seen on the teevee that you can walk into a store ( maybe they even call it a “ clinic ” ) and tell a doctor you have anxiety or some other malady , the symptoms of which could possibly be alleviated by the active ingredient in the “ pot ” and they will write you out a prescription for some “ reefers , ” “ muggles , ” or “ grass , ” as it is referred to in the common parlances of various generations of dope - smokers , and then I guess you are free to self - administer the “ El Gallo ” in accordance with local statutes of limitations , legal - wise .
The thing I do n’t get about this blunt but effective workaround to the legal obstacles involved with getting high on some “ boo boo bama ” — as I have never heard anyone refer to it — is howcumzit you gotta " spark it up " to get the benefit , you know ?
Could n’t you just eat a pill or a biscuit of some ground up “ Assassin of Youth , ” — as somebody musta called it at least once — to experience the desired effects of the “ Aunt Mary ? ” I mean , is n’t it a Bad Idea to inhale lots of smoke ?
I do n’t know , man , it just seems weird to let errbody hoove on cigars and cigarettes and not let people “ Fly Mexican Airlines ” in the privacy of their own castle , you know ?
Plus , think of the crazy - ass Tax Revenue on that shit .
Now look , I do n't want it near schools , I do n't want it sold to children .
I do n’t think people should be allowed to “ Get a gage up ” like , at the baseball stadium or in the park at the kids ’ soccer game or whatever , you know ?
I mean , I totally believe in the theory of second - hand smoke , and the last thing I need after I go to a baseball game and drink nine beers is to get pulled over by some cop and test positive for “ Green Goddess ” because somebody was up in the cheap seats with me “ Hitting The Hay , ” as it were , right ?
So anyway , I saw that bonehead Michael Phelps , the super - duper swimming guy from the Olympics , got his picture in the paper doing what appears to me to be hittin ’ on a bong , or as The New York Times referred to it , “ inhaling from a pipe . ”
Har !
This guy won a double - fistful of gold medals at the Olympics , and he ’s got a shitload of endorsement deals , so it ’s like , all he ’s gotta do is remember how to swim four years from now and he ’s gonna be like , the , I dunno , the Tiger Woods of swimming or something , and he ’s too much of a dodo to realize looking like he's all “ Puffing The Dragon ” in public might play hob with his career and cereal - box deal .
I thought that picture of him with all the medals on the Sports Illustrated made it look like he was wearing a halter top , which I do n’t think was a flattering look for him .
Meanwhile , he already got nailed for driving while intoxicated , so somebody needs to be in charge of him and get him a bodyguard or something to make sure he does n’t piss away the rest of his career with any more frat - boy moves , and yeah , if he was n’t a such big deal nobody would care .
And even though he apologized for his little “ Tea Party ” he lost the cereal box gig , Jesus Jefferson Airplane , man , you lost the cereal box gig !
For doing some shit you coulda got a prescription for in California !
There are people who would let you fly on their private jet so you could go to an herb store and get a legal piece of paper so ’s you could “ Boot The Gong ! ”
So look , I got zero sympathy for this guy , especially when you look at what happened to the sumo guy who got busted in Japan for “ Chiefing ” and lost his license to sumo or whatever .
No offense , but that sumo guy did n’t look very fat , and I always thought that was key in the sumo game .
I wonder if he tried telling the sumo big shots he was training with the Zig Zag Man to improve his appetite in order to slap on some sumo power ?
That ’s the way I woulda played it , but I do n't think I 'd need drugs to achieve sumo - level fatassedness , man , nobody needs to do anything to me to get me to eat some Doritos , you know ?
Too bad he did n’t get a prescription .
The famous Dunbar number , or “ theoretical cognitive limit to the number of people with whom one can maintain stable social relationships ” , is generally accepted to be about 150 .
However , in a recent interview with The Economist , Cameron Marlow , a research scientist at Facebook , shared some interesting stats on Facebook users ’ social behavior patterns .
His findings : while many people have hundreds friends on Facebook , they still only actively communicate with a small few .
Or to quote the author of the article , “ Humans may be advertising themselves more efficiently .
But they still have the same small circles of intimacy as ever . ”
Here ’s the data from Marlow :
The average male Facebook user with 120 friends :
Leaves comments on 7 friends ’ photos , status updates , or wall
friends ’ photos , status updates , or wall Messages or chats with 4 friends
The average female Facebook user with 120 friends :
Leaves comments on 10 friends ’ photos , status updates , or wall
friends ’ photos , status updates , or wall Messages or chats with 6 friends
The average male Facebook user with 500 friends :
Leaves comments on 17 friends ’ photos , status updates , or wall
friends ’ photos , status updates , or wall Messages or chats with 10 friends
The average female Facebook user with 500 friends :
Leaves comments on 26 friends ’ photos , status updates , or wall
friends ’ photos , status updates , or wall Messages or chats with 16 friends
In other words , Facebook users comment on stuff from only about 5 - 10 % of their Facebook friends .
And as has been shown by many other studies , women communicate with more people in all cases than men .
“ People who are members of online social networks are not so much ‘ networking ’ as they are ‘ broadcasting their lives to an outer tier of acquaintances who are n’t necessarily inside the Dunbar circle , ' ” Lee Rainie , the director of the Pew Internet & American Life Project , says .
After news broke this week about a North Carolina factory tied to bacteria - tainted syringes that killed five patients , criminal investigators revealed a telling fact :
The company ’s " chief microbiologist " was a teenage high school dropout .
This week , two former employees of the AM2PAT manufacturing center in Angier , N.C. , pleaded guilty in federal court to charges related to falsifying documents and shipping bacteria - tainted syringes full of blood thinners meant for patients receiving intravenous fluids .
Authorities are still seeking the company ’s owner , who will face a 10 - count indictment .
In addition to the deaths , more than 200 people were sickened by contaminated syringes .
The case raises a glaring question :
As this biological tragedy was taking shape , where was the agency charged with standing between Americans and deadly medicine ?
The Food and Drug Administration , it turns out , was aware of problems at the 40 - employee lab as early as 2005 .
According to a letter ( pdf ) it released Wednesday to ProPublica and the Raleigh News & Observer , the FDA warned the company in August of 2005 about " serious violations " and ordered the firm to change its practices .
During a June 2005 inspection of the company , the FDA found nine " significant [ quality ] violations , " the letter says .
The company failed to conduct routine tests on its syringe - filling machine .
The daily log of the " clean room " was only filled out once a month , the letter states .
The company ’s complaint - response system was in disarray .
And employees were not properly trained :
One was chewing gum while filling syringes ; another was " improperly gowning " during sterility tests .
The FDA letter called on the company to " take prompt action to correct these deviations " and asked the company to send a letter detailing its plans to change .
Soon after , the FDA received a complaint about the syringe maker , according to the agency ’s database of adverse events tied to medical devices .
The November 2005 complaint stated that " particles " were found in the blood - thinning heparin solution of one syringe .
The FDA conducted a follow - up inspection in January 2006 but did not issue a letter to the company , said FDA spokeswoman Siobhan DeLancey .
Another complaint was filed with the FDA in March 2007 , when a patient ’s husband " found an unopened syringe with black and brown floating matter . "
The patient developed an infection and was hospitalized , the complaint says ; " Provider suspects lot contamination . "
Two months later , another complaint came in .
This one was more explicit : " [ W ] hite sediment streaks " were observed in multiple lots of the syringes , a " lay user " reported .
The FDA did not visit until December of 2007 and issued a recall of the syringes that month , the News & Observerreported .
It was too late , though , to reverse the course of brain damage , severe infections and deaths caused by bacteria in the syringes .
Patients at hospitals in Illinois , Texas , Florida and Nebraska received the tainted solutions , lawsuits and news reports show .
The FDA ’s medical device inspection program has come under fire .
The Government Accountability Office – Congress ’ auditing arm – wrote in 2007 that inspectors were visiting operations like AM2PAT every five years instead of once every two years as required .
But DeLancey said that since 1999 , inspectors had visited AM2PAT six times .
A 2006 report by the House oversight committee raised an alarm about FDA supervisors overriding the concerns of field investigators and refusing to issue warning letters to medical device makers .
In the case at hand , it appears that the FDA may have been too eager to take AM2PAT ’s word that it fixed problems after the 2005 letter and follow - up inspection the next year , said Dr. Ned Feder , a former scientist with the National Institutes of Health who now researches FDA issues at the advocacy group Project On Government Oversight .
He said the agency should have inspected and re-inspected facilities until every problem was thoroughly abated .
Feder said the question of whether FDA effectively followed up after its 2005 inspection is sadly apparent : " A few years later , the same sorts of problems led to the injury or death . "
Fascinating conversation today over lunch today .
It was held under Chatham House Rules , so I cannot reveal the identity of any of the parties or their firms .
However , the conversation steered towards the Madoff affair , and one fellow proffered the thinking behind why Madoff remains out on bail , and could be working towards a plea deal .
A guilty verdict is a slam dunk in a trial .
However , that does nothing for the $ 43 billion in lost assets for the folks who were taken ( i.e , investors / confidence marks ) .
and , it seems that Madoff ’s remaining assets , versus what was stolen / lost / embezzled are a mere pittance .
Hence , the possible Madoff deal .
One theory floating around is that Madoff will implicate the major banks ( HSBC , RBS , Santander , BNP Paribas , Nomura ) , fund of funds , referrers in his massive fraud .
Once he rolls over and sings , alleging they knew ( or should have known ) it clears the path for a massive litigation frenzy against any and all of the parties involved .
I feel sad fort he people who lost money , but if this theory is remotely accurate , it would be terrible .
It would allow a ( alleged ) horrific con man / thief avoid justice .
And , it rewards the people for their own bad judgment in giving Mr. Mathematically - Impossible / No - Fees their money , while seeking to place the blame elsewhere .
Zero responsibility for all involved !
Its the American way !

FedEx a mega logistics and delivery company has actively resisted providing benefits to gay families , even in states where gay people can marry .
In a letter to a legally married employee in Massachusetts , FedEx actually invokes the Defense of Marriage Act to justify why it wo n’t provide benefits to its LGBT employees ’ families in Massachusetts !
FedEx ’s tortured legal argument goes something like this :
" We have a federally regulated health insurance plan and since the federal government defines marriage as a union between a man and a woman we are free to ignore your marriage in the provision of employee benefits . "

Top 10 : Legendary Drinkers
Page 1 of 3
The true drinking man is downright repulsed by the revolving - door rehab stints of modern - day celebrities .
These amateurs obviously do n’t know how to hold their liquor and their profession simultaneously .
On that note , let ’s look at the 10 most legendary drinkers who were able to carry notoriety in one hand and a glass of scotch in the other .
Number 10
Dean Martin
J&B ScotchAlthough we more recently heard tales that Dino ’s mandatory drink - in - hand was either non-alcoholic or a real one that he nursed for hours , you still would n’t have wanted him to be the designated driver .
Dean favored Jack Daniel ’s — though usually not during working hours or into the wee hours like his Rat Pack buddies .
A morning round of golf was usually more precious to him than sleeping off a night of partying .
Despite these revelations , he was exceptionally convincing in his persona , and that deserves placement in our cast of legendary drinkers .
I ca n’t believe he drank the whole thing :
Our favorite Dean Martin remark : " I 'd hate to be a teetotaler .
Imagine getting up in the morning and knowing that 's as good as you 're going to feel all day . "
Number 9
Benjamin Franklin
Number 8
Edgar Allan Poe
Madeira wine
The guy on the $ 100 bill developed his own list of 13 virtues to follow through life .
No. 1 read : “ Temperance .
Eat not to dullness ; drink not to elevation . "
So why do we consider him a legendary drinker ?
Well , he was n’t exactly a teetotaler .
When he was n’t busy inventing , innovating or hanging out in Europe , he was professing his love for potent potables , gushing , “ Behold the rain which descends from heaven upon our vineyards ; there it enters the roots of the vines , to be changed into wine ; a constant proof that God loves us , and loves to see us happy . ”
Either that , or he toasted , " Beer is proof that God loves us and wants us to be happy . "
There ’s now debate over which words he actually spoke or penned , but you know what ?
It does n’t matter .
The words ring true , and we hold these truths to be self - evident .
Philadelphia bars marked Franklin ’s 300th birthday in 2006 by concocting specialty drinks like the “ Franklin Royale ” and " Printer 's Pickle ” martini .
A brewery even introduced an ale named " Poor Richard 's Tavern Spruce .
" Brandy , gin
“ Nevermore ” or “ I ’ll have one more ” ?
The man who gave us The Raven and so many other timeless works labored hard to earn his status as a legendary drinker .
We ’re not sure of his sobriety level when he married his 13 - year - old cousin ( take that , Jerry Lee Lewis ) , but we do know he operated with a persistent buzz for much of his adult life .
And though his days on Earth ended far too early — in 1849 , at the age of 40 — Poe ’s mystique and influence are as strong as ever .
As a couple of many examples of his influence , unknown individuals visit Poe ’s grave site every January 19th , the poet ’s birthday , drink a toast and leave roses .
And what about that NFL team from Baltimore with the three mascots named Edgar , Allan and Poe ?
I ca n’t believe he drank the whole thing :
While some believe it to have been the ultimate pub crawl , the events leading up to Poe ’s demise remain disputed .
And the man passed on too soon to regain coherence and clear the air — or at least explain why he was reportedly found wearing another man ’s clothes .
More of the world 's most legendary drinkers ...
An international research team led by Massachusetts General Hospital ( MGH ) investigators has conducted the first detailed analysis of deaths during expeditions to the summit of Mt. Everest .
They found that most deaths occur during descents from the summit in the so - called " death zone " above 8,000 meters and also identified factors that appear to be associated with a greater risk of death , particularly symptoms of high - altitude cerebral edema .
" We know that climbing Everest is dangerous , but exactly how and why people have died had not been studied , " says Paul Firth , MB , ChB , of the MGH Department of Anesthesia , who led the study " It had been assumed that avalanches and falling ice – particularly in the Khumbu Icefall on the Nepal route – were the leading causes of death and that high - altitude pulmonary edema would be a common problem at such extreme altitude .
But our results do not support either assumption . "
Thousands of climbers have attempted to reach the summit of 8,850 - meter ( 29,000 - foot ) Mount Everest since the 1920s .
In order to examine the circumstances surrounding all deaths on Everest expeditions , the research team – which included investigators from three British hospitals and the University of Toronto – reviewed available expedition records including the Himalayan Database , a compilation of information from all expeditions to 300 major peaks in the world 's highest range .
Of a total of reported 212 deaths on Everest from 1921 to 2006 , 192 occurred above Base Camp , the last encampment before technical ( roped ) climbing begins .
Firth and three physician co-authors – all experienced Himalayan mountaineers with expertise in managing high - altitude illness – reviewed records for all deaths and classified them according to available information .
More detailed analysis was conducted on deaths occurring above 8,000 meters during the past 25 years .
Deaths were categorized as traumatic , from falls or external hazards such as avalanches ; nontraumatic , from high - altitude illness , hypothermia or other medical causes ; or as disappearances .
Expedition participants were classified as either ' climbers , ' individuals from outside the Himalayan region , or ' sherpas ' – high - altitude porters , most of them ethnic Sherpas or Tibetans , hired to transport equipment and otherwise assist the climbers .
The overall mortality rate for Everest mountaineers during the entire 86 - year period was 1.3 percent ; the rate among climbers was 1.6 percent and the rate among sherpas was 1.1 percent .
During the past 25 years , a period during which a greater percentage of moutaineers climbed above 8,000 meters , the death rate for non-Himalayan climbers descending via the longer Tibetan northeast ridge was 3.4 percent , while on the shorter Nepal route it was 2.5 percent .
Factors most associated with the risk of death were excessive fatigue , a tendency to fall behind other climbers and arriving at the summit later in the day .
Many of those who died developed symptoms such as confusion , a loss of physical coordination and unconsciousness , which suggest high - altitude cerebral edema , a swelling of the brain that results from leakage of cerebral blood vessels .
Symptoms of high - altitude pulmonary edema , which is involved in most high - altitude - related deaths , were suprisingly rare .
" High - altitude cerebral edema symptoms were common among those that died , but signs of pulmonary edema , or excessive fluid in the lungs , were unusual " Firth says .
" We also were surprised at how few people died due to avalanches and ice falls in recent years – those usually happen at lower altitudes , and overwhelmingly people died during summit bids above 8,000 feet – and that during descents , the mortality rate for climbers was six time that of sherpas . "
While the reduced mortality rate among sherpas during descent suggests that taking time to acclimatize to high altitude could improve climber survival , Firth notes that many other factors may be involved .
" Most of the sherpas are born and live their lives at high altitudes , and the competitive process for expedition employment probably selects those who are best adapted to and most skilled for the work .
So the ability of lowlanders to acclimate to these very high altitudes needs further investigation . "
During a 2004 Norwegian - American expedition from the north side of Everest led by Firth , equipment problems led the team to turn around at 8,300 meters , return to 7,900 meters and pool their oxygen supply .
Half of the team successfully re-attempted the summit and returned safely , including Randi Skuag , the first Norwegian woman to climb Everest .
Seven other climbers from other teams that year were not so fortunate – all dying above 8,000 meters , most while descending from the summit .
" The majority of those who have died on Everest were in the prime of their lives , with families and friends left bereft , " stresses Firth , who is an instructor in Anaesthesia at Harvard Medical School .
" Mountaineering is for fun ; it 's not worth dying or leaving others there to die .
Appropriate caution is the hallmark of the elite mountaineer – the mountain will always be there next year . "
The report , which will appear the December 20 / 27 issue of the British Medical Journal has been released online .
The senior author of the British Medical Journal report is Richard Salisbury , who created and maintains the Himalayan Database .
The other physician reviewers are Jeremy Windsor , MD , the Heart Hospital , London ; Andrew Sutherland , MD , Radcliffe Hospital , Oxford ; and Christopher Imray , MD , University Hospital , Coventry , all in the U.K. Additional co-authors are Hui Zheng , PhD , MGH Department of Medicine ; G.W. Kent Moore , PhD , and John Semple , MD , University of Toronto ; and Robert Roach , PhD , University of Colorado .
The study was supported by the MGH Department of Anesthesia and Critical Care .
God probably does n't exist , so stop worrying and enjoy your life , says a group of Quebec atheists .
And soon they 'll be spreading the message on downtown busses .
The Quebec Humanist association has bought ad space on about 10 bus panels .
They will appear on busses that circulate downtown .
" There is still a fairly sizeable segment of the population that considers atheists [ to be ] second rate citizens , and are not to be trusted .
And this is the attitude that we want to change , " said Michel Virard , with the Quebec Humanist Association .
Similar campaigns have run in London , England , Washington , DC , and Toronto to varying degrees of controversy .
Australia and Italy have banned such campaigns in the past .
In Montreal , it appears citizens are of mixed mind .
" People should be allowed to express their views .
I do n't necessarily believe it , but that 's okay , " said one man who spoke to CTV Montreal .
" I think some people would be very angry at that , " said another .
According to the QHA , at last count there were 400,000 non-believers in the province .
That means they are second to Roman Catholics in terms of belief groups Quebec .
The group points out that US President Barack Obama was raised by an atheist mother .
They point out he gave them a shout - out in his inauguration speech .
" And the fact that the President of the United States dares mention that there are non-believers in the U.S. that was a big thing .
I hope it 's going to catch on when other people realize you can be good without God , " said Michel Pion , also with the Quebec Humanist Association .
Many movies require actors and actresses to wear costumes or to apply basic makeup to take on a specific role .
Some directors may even require actors and actresses to change their hair color or lose weight .
Few movies , however , require its stars to undergo massive transformations for their roles - a select few of which are unique to the point that they create a memorable experience in and of themselves .
From prosthetic body parts to changing one ’s race , gender , or species , these are the most unique transformations that actors have undergone for their on - screen performances .
Brad Pitt – The Curious Case of Benjamin Button
In the film adaptation of F Scott Fitzgerald ’s famous children ’s book , Pitt plays a character that ages backward .
He went several transformations for this film , and it is not until the end do female moviegoers get to see the Brad Pitt they are used to .
Certainly different than Pitt ’s role in Fight Club .

Heralded as Ledger ’s career defining performance , his portrayal of The Joker was quite different than that of his precursor , Jack Nicholson .
A nice touch was the subtler green hair , an overall more disturbed and disheveled appearance , and the “ Chelsea Grin ” facial scars .
His portrayal of The Joker could easily be regarded as the only character in this franchise capable of giving children nightmares .
Charlize Theron – Monster
Theron takes a break from being unbelievably hot by gaining weight , aging 25 years , and not wearing makeup .
And the denouement of her portrayal of a lesbian prostitute - turned - serial killer character is the bad fitting jeans that moms used to wear in the early 1990s .
Definitely a change of pace for Theron , and a look that we hope to not see her embrace again in the coming years , or ever .
Emma Thompson – Nanny McPhee
In this film , Thompson plays a haggard , wart - covered , and uni-browed nanny whose unflattering characteristics vanish upon the children entrusted to her care learning to mind her .
She is almost unrecognizable until then end of the movie , which makes you go …
” Oh yeah …it ’s Emma Thompson . ”
Mike Myers – The Cat in the Hat
For The Cat in The Hat , Myers had the distinction of playing Dr. Seuss ’ most famous character , and donned a full cat suit and whiskers in order to complete the transformation .
For this film , makeup guru Rick Baker was enlisted , who also did the makeup and special effects consulting on Hellboy and Norbit , among others .
Jim Carrey – The Grinch Who Stole Christmas
After filming The Mask , Carrey swore off future films involving intense makeup but claims he was unable to pass on this role .
Reportedly , the makeup and costume donned by Carrey for this film took between 3 - 8 hours to complete .
This unique transformation seems as if it could not have been executed successfully , had it been anyone but Carrey .
Rebecca Romijn– X Men
Romijn ’s makeup in X Men , was the culmination of the work of four make - up artists , a hundred small silicon prosthetics , lots of body paint , and nine hours of application per use .
The end result is completely worth it .
According to Romijn , for X Men 2 , the application time was shortened to six hours , which helped her from becoming an evil bitch woman .
Gwenyth Paltrow – Shallow Hal
Gwenyth Paltrow plays the love interest of Hal ( Jack Black ) in this 2001 comedy about a shallow man who eventually falls in love with a very fat ( but inwardly beautiful woman ) , because he is hypnotized into believing she is outwardly beautiful .
The application of her bodysuit and accompanying make - up took four hours each time .
The upside of seeing Paltrow wearing a fat suit in this film is also getting to see her real body in a thong .
Ron Pearlman – Hell Boy
Ron Pearlman is well known for having donned makeup and prosthetics for roles ( Beauty and the Beast ) , but most impressive was what he became for the filming for the Hellboy Franchise .
Most of his red bodysuit was made of red latex , and the costume itself took 4 hours per application .
The upside for Pearlman was that in this role , he got to be the baddest of all badasses .
Eddie Murphy – Norbit
For Norbit , Murphy enlisted the work of Rick Baker – with whom he worked on The Nutty Professor and Coming to America – to help create a multitude of other characters , all played by Murphy .
Probably the most outrageous of these , was “ Rasputia Latimore ” , an outrageously sex-crazed and obese woman , who becomes the overbearing wife of the film ’s eponymous star .
The bodysuit donned by Murphy for this role was definitely a masterpiece in and of itself .
Tom Cruise – Tropic Thunder
Tom Cruise ’s cameo performance in Tropic
Thunder surprised most moviegoers , and arguably stole the show with his depiction of a greedy and ruthless Hollywood producer .
For this role , Cruise ’s diet - coke addicted “ Les Grossman ” donned a fat suit , bald wig , chest hair mat , and prosthetic hands , among others .
It is widely speculated that the inspiration for this character was the human penis ( a dick ) .
Which makes a lot of sense if you were to think about it .
Robin Williams – Mrs. Doubtfire
Robin Williams ’ portrayal as Mrs. Doubtfire in this 1993 comedy was so believable , that it made most people wonder if dressing in drag was his regular routine .
Interestingly , the prosthetic mask used in the film ( which famously goes flying into the street ) , was actually a prop ; Williams ’ real facial makeup was a composite of eight separate pieces and a whole lot of blush .
John Travolta – Hairspray
In Hairspray , Travolta gives a surprisingly convincing performance as “ Edna ” , a character he envisioned to be Sophia Loren … if she were to gain 200 lbs .
This role required Travolta to undergo five hours of extensive makeup and prosthetics to complete his transformation .
He even wore high heels in a number of scenes , which begs us to wonder how he was able to do so as effortlessly as he did .
Experience ?
Eric Stoltz – Mask
Based on a true story , Eric Stoltz plays a character whose mother is played by Cher , so naturally a serious physical disfigurement is to be expected .
However , in this film , he portrays more specifically a child suffering from craniodiaphyseal dysplasia .
The massive prosthetic cranium earned Michael Westmore & Zoltan Elek an Academy Award for Best Makeup in 1985 .
Selma Blair – A Dirty Shame
The normally small - chested Blair portrays a stripper named “ Ursula Udders ” in this 2004 offbeat film .
The prosthetic breasts used in the film required four hours of make - up .
For the nude scene , her ‘ nude ’ version of the prosthetic breasts cost $ 5,000 and the studio ’s lighting was so bright that the film only had several hours to film before the lights started to crack them .
It was essentially a one - time use set , that was discarded shortly after .
John Matuszak – The Goonies
The one - time professional football player Matuszak famously transformed into everyone ’s favorite childhood freak , Lotney “ Sloth ” Fratelli , in Spielberg ’s 1986 The Goonies .
The application of his make up – which was quite groundbreaking at the time – took a total of five hours per application .
Well worth it .
Baby Ruth !
Posted on by id5066298.ewzjj.xyz
One lesson my parents taught me , and that I learned well , in my childhood was that I ’m not worthy of forgiveness .
I ’m not worthy of anybody forgiving me , even myself .
Part of this was the expectation of perfection .
I was never perfect ( who in this world is ) .
I always made mistakes .
And worse , I was always “ getting in trouble . ”
“ Getting in trouble ” meant not only the initial punishment but after punishments as well .
The initial punishment was always a beating .
Sometimes only by one of them , sometimes by both .
One memorable time had the two of them trading places for about 10 different times .
Finally , on the eleventh time , they asked me who I wanted to “ spank ” me that time .
I realized at that point that they had been taking turns , and that it was Mom ’s turn to “ spank ” me , so I said , “ Mom . ”
She asked why , did she not “ spank ” as hard as her husband ?
My response was completely truthful ( and almost got me beat again ) , “ No , you actually hit harder than he does , but you ’ve been taking turns and he spanked me last , so it ’s your turn now . ”
Hey , she asked , right ?
If she did n’t want the truth ( and I would have been beat for a lie if she found out it was a lie ) she should never have asked .
Anyway , the after punishments would go on for weeks or months .
One time , I had to write “ I will not prevaricate . ”
Does n’t sound to bad , does it ?
Except , I had to do it from September until almost Christmas .
At first , I was allowed to sit at the table and write my lines .
Then one day in October he decided to toy with me and asked me if I was tired of sitting at the dining room table all the time writing .
I said I was , thinking I was finally done with the after punishment .
No .
He told me since I was tired of sitting at the dining room table , I could now stand at the dining room table and write .
By the time I was really done with that after punishment , I ’d written over 100,000 lines .
Of course , the whole time I was in after punishments , I was told how terrible I was for doing whatever it was that had gotten me punished ( and some of the things were as simple as forgetting to take out the garbage or make the milk or not getting straight A’s on my report card ) .
And when I was finally allowed off of whatever the after punishment was , I was still not forgiven .
They would let me know just how bad I was , and how I did n’t deserve forgiveness .
And when I got in trouble the next time ( not if , but when ) , I was reminded of all the times before when I ’d gotten in trouble .
I was told that since I was constantly in trouble I did n’t deserve forgiveness .
It was a vicious cycle , really .
Get in trouble , get punished , get told how terrible I was and how I did n’t deserve forgiveness , get the after punishment , finally get off trouble , get in trouble again and told how that proved I was n’t good enough for forgiveness .
Lather , rinse , repeat .
So , as you might expect , one thing that has been really difficult for me is learning to forgive myself .
Forgiveness just was n’t something that was in my vocabulary for a very long time .
I made a mistake ?
I had to suffer for it , and if other people around me did n’t make me suffer , then I would make myself suffer by being miserable , by constantly reminding myself ( and others ) what scum I was .
Needless to say , this did n’t help my self esteem , constantly telling myself how terrible I was .
Self forgiveness is something that goes hand in hand with self esteem .
As long as I hold a mistake ( small or large ) over my own head , I continue to beat myself up for it .
I call myself names like stupid , and scum , and worse .
I reinforce those feeling of inadequacy , of being less than human , of not being worthy of anything good , when I do n’t forgive myself .
A few weeks ago , I wrote I was getting back on the horse with self - esteem in my own life .
That my self esteem had taken a bit of a hit recently .
What happened was that I ran a camping event for my local group .
It was a financial success , but not a success by my definition of the term success .
My definition of a successful event is that when things go wrong ( as they always will ) , if the paying guests do n’t see the problems , then the event is a success .
The event I organized had guests seeing some of the things that went wrong .
Actually , just one thing that went wrong , but for me , it was enough .
As the organizer , the buck stops here .
Yes , I had people advising me and some of the advise was n’t completely on target .
My assistant organizer did n’t do what he was supposed to do , which left me doing his job as well as mine .
There were other problems , places where I made mistakes .
Finally , on the main day of the event , I became deathly ill with heat stroke and had to be rushed to the hospital .
I castigated myself ten ways to Sunday about that whole situation .
I apologized profusely to the leaders of my group for “ failing ” ( and had them tell me that if this was a failure , then they wanted me to fail more ) .
I ’ve refused all opportunities to organize another event since then .
And all this because I could n’t forgive myself for the mistakes I made and for being human .
It has been six months since that event .
Everybody else has moved on but me .
I ’m miserable , expecting to hear how I ’ll never be allowed to organize another event as long as I live ( or remain in this group ) .
I ’m expecting the leaders of this group to treat me like the parents did .
To give me the cold shoulder .
To not want to be near me .
They have n’t forgiven me because they see nothing to forgive .
Yes , there were a few problems , but people had a lot of fun , and the event made the money we wanted and needed it to make .
Only I have n’t forgiven myself .
Getting back on the horse is n’t easy .
Step one was figuring out I ’d fallen off .
That I ’m okay , just as I am .
Step two is forgiving myself for my mistakes , real or imagined .
If I ’m okay , just as I am , then there ’s no reason for me to continue to punish myself .
There is no reason for me to be walking on eggshells waiting for people to ridicule me .
There is no reason for me not to forgive myself .
And if it ’s okay to forgive myself , then it ’s okay to like myself .
Which helps the self esteem to grow .
Just like self castigation can be a downward spiral , self esteem can be an upward spiral .

Last March , Facebook caught some flak when some hacks circulated showing how to access private photos of any user .
These were enabled by egregiously lazy design : viewing somebody ’s private photos simply required determining their user ID ( which shows up in search results ) and then manually fetching a URL of the form :
www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=1&view=all&subj=[uid]&id=[uid]
This hack was live for a few weeks in February , exposing some photos of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg and ( reportedly ) Paris Hilton , before the media picked it up in March and Facebook upgraded the site .
Instead of using properly formatted PHP queries as capabilities to view photos , Faceook now verifies the requesting user against the ACL for each photo request .
What could possibly go wrong ?
Well , as I discovered this week , the photos themselves are served from a separate content - delivery domain , leading to some problems which highlight the difficulty of building access control into an enormous , globally distributed website like Facebook .
Here ’s an example “ public link ” of a photo of me in my office :
http://www.facebook.com/photo.php?pid=34947682&id=210132
Posting this link should n’t be a privacy problem , as you should n’t be able to see a photo by following this link unless you ’re in my network of friends .
Facebook promotes this view by telling you at the bottom of the page that you can safely send this link out to friends , and in fact such links are posted all over the web if you search for them .
Access rights are enforced on the Facebook page , so knowing this link does n’t reveal the photo .
But , unfortunately , the actual photo file is embedded in the page with the address :
http://photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-sf2p/v646/41/83/210132/n210132_34947682_4899.jpg
Presumably , ‘ fbcdn.net ’ stands for ‘ Facebook Content Delivery Network , ’ and the image is hosted here using a high - performance photo server which does n’t have to do all the session management overhead of the larger site .
Keep in mind that , as reported in October , Facebook is hosting 10 + billion photos , by some measures more than any other site on the web .
If the URL of a photo were temporary and difficult to guess from the public address , this scheme might be okay .
The photo server will in fact respond to a request from wget without any cookies at all .
It has to , because it is in a different domain than the main Facebook site , and browsers are specifically designed to prevent transferring state between domains .
Unfortunately the link is neither temporary nor difficult to guess .
The links appear to work indefinitely , based on trying some months - old ones floating around the web .
Worse , most of the apparent randomness in the URL is not needed to access the photo .
The following link is just as valid as the one posted above :
http://photos-c.ak.fbcdn.net/photos-ak-sf2p/210132/n210132_34947682_4899.jpg
All we need is the actual filename of the photo , and I ’ve reverse - engineered the filename format as :
[ photo - size ] [ uid ] _[ pid ] _[ PIN ] .jpg
Photo - size is just a character in the set {t , s , n} representing the resolution of the image , uid is the user ID of the user who uploaded the photo , pid is a photo ID , and PIN is a four - digit random number .
I ’m calling it a PIN because it was chosen to be four decimal digits , which can only be assumed to have been done in a foolish analogy to bank card security .
It ’s easy to learn everything but the PIN given a public link to the photo .
Brute - forcing the PIN is also fairly easy : it ’s a space of 9000 , which can be searched in about 45 minutes using one script .
This is also easily parallelisable , given that we can query any of the mirrored photo servers in the set {photos - a.ak.fbcdn.net , photos-b.ak.fbcdn.net … photos-z.ak.fbcdn.net} we can get this down to under 2 minutes .
This is still a lot of work for one photo , but it gets better .
Incrementing the photo ID by one reliably gives the next photo that was uploaded as part of the same album .
Looking at the next few photos in sequence from the one posted above , the sequence of PINs is { 4899,5210,5535,5857,6193,6524,6853} , giving deltas of { 311,325,322,336,331,329} .
These are almost certainly created by timestamping as the photos are received .
So , given the public link to one photo , and doing one brute - force , we can pretty easily get the rest of the album with 10 - 20 queries per photo .
I ’ve coded this up and it works splendidly –the photo servers do n’t appear to do any rate - limiting or blocking .
How to fix this problem ?
Obviously Facebook could check the session cookies for every photo request , but we ’ll assume this is impractical given the current setup .
If concede that using the knowledge of an opaque URL as a capability to view a photo is all we have to work with , then there is no reason not to increase the length of the PIN portion to be a cryptographically - strong 20 digits–it does n’t need to ever be written or stored by a human .
Of course , these must be generated randomly as photos are uploaded .
It would also be prudent to have the PINs expire after an hour or so , as they are n’t meant to provide a permanent link , and may end up cached in all sorts of places .
Finally , multiple requests with invalid PINs should lead to IP blocking to prevent crawling .
This is a smaller hole than the one from last year , as we need to find a public photo link first .
As far as I can see , there ’s no predictable pattern of photo IDs for given user IDs , so we ca n’t access photos for our arbitrary choice of user .
Still , it is a privacy violation as Facebook promotes the view that public links wo n’t allow access to photos , when they actually do .
Above all , it is an inexcusably sloppy design , especially given the bad press Facebook received for the original problems .
During the Bush years , it often seemed that on any given day all the leading conservative commentators were reading from the same list of talking points — because they were .
But without a conservative in the WH , who ’s handing out the talking points now ?
One thing ’s for sure : someone is .
Duncan Black , a tougher guy than I am , watches Larry Kudlow , and finds him echoing the Boehner line that taxpayer money is being used to “ reward ” Fannie and Freddie , which are owned by … the taxpayers .

Republic has this evening called for Prince Andrew ’s use of taxpayers ’ money to be subjected to a full parliamentary inquiry after a damning Channel 4 documentary .
The Dispatches programme raised a number of questions that the palace was apparently happy to leave unanswered .
Among these were serious allegations about potential conflicts of interest arising from Prince Andrew ’s role as trade ambassador .
Tonight ’s Channel 4 Dispatches documentary alleges that Prince Andrew took a helicopter flight costing £ 6,000 from Windsor to Shoreham , when a first class train ticket would have cost just £ 90 .
The palace disputes this figure .
The documentary also claims that Buckingham Palace has agreed with the government not to disclose royal travel costs that are less than £ 10,000 .
Republic , who exposed abuses of RAF helicopter flights by prince William last year , will submit a Freedom of Information request to find out how much the royals really spend on travel .
Republic spokesperson Graham Smith , who was interviewed for the documentary said today : “ We believe there are serious concerns about Andrew ’s official role which remain unanswered .
This is a publicly funded post in a time of recession which is costing the taxpayer a lot of money .
It appears Andrew is benefiting personally from this position and we are demanding an investigation . ”
“ This documentary was utterly damning of Andrew ’s role .
His business dealings are apparently shrouded in secrecy while he remains an official UK ambassador – it is an unacceptable situation . ”
“ Republic will continue to campaign using Freedom of Information laws to uncover the truth . ”

FLORHAM PARK , N.J. --
Now , that 's one costly snowball .
New York Jets defensive end Shaun Ellis was fined $ 10,000 by the NFL for throwing snow at fans following the team 's loss at Seattle on Sunday .
Several fans threw snowballs at New York players and staff as they walked off the field after the Seahawks ' 13 - 3 victory .
As he approached the walkway leading to the locker room , Ellis reached into a pile of snow , picked up a large chunk and tossed it into the stands at Qwest Field , appearing to hit at least a few fans .
No one was believed to have been injured .
Ellis said Tuesday that he was n't angry at the time , and there was no malicious intent on his part .
" It was all in fun , " he said .
Video of the incident originated on YouTube after a fan captured it on film and posted it on the site .
As of early Tuesday afternoon , the 53 - second clip had been viewed nearly 340,000 times .
Several other Web sites have also posted links to the video .
" It was kind of like a little battlefield out there , so to speak , " Ellis said .
" I mean , it was just all in fun , going to the locker room . "
According to an NFL spokesman , players are notified before each season that any contact with fans that potentially presents crowd - control issues and risk of injury is prohibited .
Players are also informed that they must not confront fans during games and must leave any issues to security personnel .
Coach Eric Mangini thought his team was put in a dangerous predicament as it walked off the field , saying several people were pelted with snowballs .
" That situation in the stadium in general was not a very safe situation for anybody involved , " Mangini said .
" That does n't justify us getting involved in it on the flip side of that .
He understands that .
We thought that there could 've been more done to prevent what was happening in terms of the safety from snowballs coming down . "
Mangini seemed to indicate the Jets could file a formal complaint to the league regarding the behavior of Seattle 's fans .
" I would n't want that to happen at our stadium , " he said .
" I 'm sure Seattle did n't want that , either .
It 's just something that hopefully can be avoided whether it 's us , Seattle , whoever in the future .
You just do n't want someone to get struck and hurt in that environment . "
Mike Holmgren did n't exactly condone the behavior of Seattle 's fans ; he had to dodge snowballs as he made a victory lap around the perimeter of the field after his final home game as Seahawks coach .
But he understood why the residents of this usually temperate region were firing away .
Sunday was only the second time in team history the Seahawks played at home in snow .
They played in the Kingdome from 1976 to 1999 .
" First of all , the people at our stadium do n't see snow that much , so it had to be a tremendous novelty , " Holmgren said .
" I know if my grandkids were up there , and there was a snowball sitting right there -- and they 're good kids , they 're not mean kids -- it'd be pretty hard for them not to throw it . "
Holmgren said when he was coach of the Packers from 1992 to 1998 , the stands in Green Bay were entirely cleared of snow before games to avoid incidents .
" No one got hurt , which is a good thing , " he said of Sunday .
" And the best thing we can do probably is [ improve ] our preparation in getting the snow out of the stadium if it should ever happen again . "
Mangini said Ellis would n't face additional discipline from the Jets , and the defensive captain would play Sunday in the regular - season finale at home against Miami .
It 's the latest troublesome incident involving Ellis , who was arrested for speeding and marijuana possession last month and could face a suspension next season under the league 's substance - abuse policy .
The league is still reviewing that incident .
" I 'm just continuing to go out and just play football , " Ellis said .
" In the end , we 're all human . "
is it still there ?

April 2007 war die 22 - jährige Polizistin Michéle Kiesewetter mit ihrem zwei Jahre älteren Kollege Martin A. auf Streife .
Der Mord an ihr wurde dem " Phantom von Heilbronn " zu ... geschrieben .
Anzeige
Überraschende Wende im Fall der gesuchten Phantomtäterin , die unter anderem im April 2007 in Heilbronn eine Polizistin erschossen haben soll .
Die Ermittler halten es nun für wahrscheinlich , dass es die Serienverbrecherin überhaupt nicht gibt .
Die fraglichen DNA - Spuren einer bestimmten Frau könnten vielmehr schon auf den unbenutzten Wattestäbchen der Polizei gewesen sein .
Das teilte die Saarbrücker Staatsanwaltschaft mit .
Die Zweifel kamen bei der Abklärung der Identität einer verbrannten Leiche auf .
Es stellte sich heraus , dass es ein bereits im Jahr 2002 verschwundener Asylbewerber ist .
Von ihm lagen Fingerabdrücke bei der Polizei vor .
Auf einem der untersuchten Papiere dieser erkennungsdienstlichen Behandlung in Völklingen fand sich überraschend die DNA - Spur des Phantoms , „ was eigentlich nicht sein konnte “ , wie der Sprecher der Staatsanwaltschaft , Ernst Meiners , mitteilte .
Bei einer nochmaligen Untersuchung fand sich die DNA nicht mehr .
Dies steht seit Donnerstag vergangener Woche fest .
Anzeige
Daraufhin kam der Verdacht auf , dass das Untersuchungsmaterial der Ermittler bereits mit DNA in Berührung gekommen sein muss .
Dies könne theoretisch schon beim Pflücken der Baumwolle geschehen , sagte Meiners .
Die Herstellung der Wattestäbchen wird nun überprüft .
Wie lange dies dauere , könne noch nicht gesagt werden .
Es bestehe die Möglichkeit , dass Wattestäbchen einzelner Lieferchargen verunreinigt sein könnten , hieß es am Abend in einer Erklärung des baden - württembergischen und des saarländischen Landeskriminalamts sowie der Staatsanwaltschaft Heilbronn .
„ Dieser Hypothese wird seit Februar dieses Jahres mit hohem Untersuchungsaufwand nachgegangen “ , hieß es. Bereits seit April 2008 seien im Kriminaltechnischen Institut des LKA in Stuttgart mehrere hundert unbenutzte Wattestäbchen überprüft worden ; bei keiner Probe habe es Hinweise auf eine Fremdkontaminierung gegeben .
Konkrete Aussagen zu bestimmten Verunreinigungen beziehungsweise Spurenverursachern seien deshalb bis zum Vorliegen eines gesicherten Ergebnisses spekulativ .
Wenige Stunden vor der Enthüllung der neuen Erkenntnisse hatte „ stern.de “ berichtet , höchstwahrscheinlich seien die Wattestäbchen der Ermittler schon vorher mit DNA - Material kontaminiert worden - möglicherweise von einer unachtsamen Mitarbeiterin eines Herstellers dieser Stäbchen .
Anzeige
Die Wattestäbchen wurden dem Bericht zufolge zwar ordnungsgemäß sterilisiert , aber menschliche Körperzellen – etwa aus Hautresten , Schweiß und anderen Sekreten – überleben nach Auskunft von Experten eine solche Maßnahme .
„ stern.de “ zitiert dazu Professor Christian Ruef vom Universitätsspital Zürich .
Packerinnen eines norddeutschen Unternehmens für Medizinbedarf sollen Speichelproben abgegeben haben , um ihr DNA - Profil mit dem des Phantoms abgleichen zu können .
An 40 verschiedenen Tatorten in Baden - Württemberg , Rheinland - Pfalz , Saarland und in Österreich wurden DNA - Spuren des vermeintlichen Phantoms gefunden .
Die beim Landeskriminalamt in Stuttgart angesiedelte Sonderkommission „ Parkplatz “ der Heilbronner Polizei könnte in eine völlig falsche Richtung ermittelt haben .
Nach ihren Angaben steht die DNA - Spur an dem Streifenwagen , an dem die Heilbronner Polizistin am 25 .
April 2007 erschossen und ihr Kollege schwer verletzt worden war , in direktem Zusammenhang mit der Tat .
Bei den anderen Tatorten konnte nicht ermittelt werden , wann die Spur dorthin gekommen war .
Kein einziger mutmaßlicher Mittäter hatte bei Vernehmungen erklärt , dass sie die Gesuchte kennen .

California ’s political watchdog agency is investigating a complaint alleging the Mormon church failed to report non-monetary contributions to the Yes on 8 campaign , a state official said Monday .
The sworn complaint by a group called Californians Against Hate contends the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter - day Saints organized phone banks from Utah and Idaho and sent direct mail to voters .
The complaint , filed four days after Californians voted to end gay marriage in the state , also alleges the Utah - based church transported people to California to walk precincts and distributed thousands of lawn signs and other campaign materials .
The church is also accused of establishing Web sites and producing commercials and other video broadcasts geared toward nonmembers .
Roman Porter , executive director of the state Fair Political Practices Commission , said the agency sent a form letter last Friday to Fred Karger , founder of Californians Against Hate , informing him it would investigate the complaint .

Confessions of a Recovering Proprietary Programmer
I am a recovering proprietary programmer , having spent most of my career working on proprietary software .
I always will be a recovering proprietary programmer , because although there is rumored to be a seven - step recovery program , it appears that no - one ever actually reaches the seventh step .
Given that recovery means change , and change can be unsettling , the first question is “ Why bother recovering ” .
Surgeons say it was a miracle that they managed to reattach the hand of a surfer who was mauled by a shark at Sydney 's Bondi Beach .
Thirty - three - year - old Glenn Orgias was attacked by a great white shark while surfing at dusk almost two weeks ago .
He was taken to St Vincent 's Hospital with his hand hanging by a three centimetre piece of skin .
Plastic surgeon Dr Kevin
Ho says doctors never expected that they would be able to reattach the hand .
" However in the Bondi surfer 's case , given his general health and the speed of which he was rushed into the operating theatre , and also the extent of his injuries , made it a possibility that we could reattach the hand , " he said .
Dr Ho says leeches were used as part of the effort to restore blood flow to the hand , and he is hopeful that Mr Orgias will regain function in it .
" I thought the hopes for the hand were close to zero , but I have hope in time that Glenn will have a working hand , " he said .
" It certainly wo n't be like our own hand but it'd be much much better than a prosthesis .
" We 're far from out of the woods but I think for him to make it to this stage is a minor miracle and a reflection of how healthy and physically well he is . "
Thank you
Mr Orgias released a statement today in which he thanked his rescuers and medical staff .
" A young French surfer applied a tourniquet that , I believe , saved my life , " he said .
" Many others gathered to help me .
I would like to thank all of these people for their bravery and compassion , " he continued .
" At the present time , it is not known what will happen to my hand .
I have a long fight ahead , but could not be working with better people than Dr Kevin Ho and his team . "
Mr Orgias also thanked his family for their support , and asked for privacy during his recovery .
Centimetre from death
St Vincent 's surgeons have been kept busy by shark attacks in Sydney waters this February , with Navy diver Paul de Gelder also being taken there after being attacked by a bull shark during a naval exercise at Garden Island .
Doctors have revealed that Mr de Gelder was only a centimetre away from death , because the shark 's teeth narrowly missed a vital artery in his leg .
Mr de Gelder lost the leg , as well as his hand , in the attack , but the hospital 's head of trauma , Dr Tony Brags , says he has been a remarkably positive patient , and is a tribute to his profession .
" I 've seen other defence patients , but I 've never seen a defence patient with so much motivation , and so much strength , and he has had a lot of training through many , many years in the defence force , " he said .
" It 's just amazing , it makes me so proud that we have Australians like this in the country . "
Overturning bad patents does not happen at Internet speed , and if you need evidence for that thesis , consider the Electronic Frontier Foundation 's Patent Busting Project .
The group set out to overturn 10 hugely broad patents back in 2004 ; four years later , only six of the patent reexamination requests have even been written , much less acted on .
But the good news for the EFF is that it is batting 1.000 with its filings , as the US Patent & Trademark Office has just granted the EFF 's sixth patent reexam request .
Writing the patent reexam requests takes plenty of time and research into possible claims that predate the patent in question .
And even when a reexam request is granted , the process can drag on for years .
If this all seems absurdly slow , this chart of the reexam process should suggest just why it takes so long .
The EFF 's latest target has been patent 5,886,274 , controlled by Seer Systems .
It covers " a system and method for joining different musical data types together in a file , distributing them over the Internet , and then playing that file . "
But , according to the EFF and law firm Day Casebeer Madrid & Batchelder , plenty of art predates the patent , which was filed in 1997 and granted in 1999 .
In fact , according to EFF Attorney Michael Kwun , the inventor of the patent had himself publicized the basic ideas in a book on MIDI written before the patent was filed .
Stanley Jungleib " encouraged others to use the techniques he described in his book and sought patent protection only after those ideas had entered the public domain , " said Kwun .
" It 's unfortunate that Seer Systems did n't call Mr. Jungleib 's book and the other prior art we cited to the PTO 's attention before the patent issued . "
USPTO agrees that a closer look is needed .
In the document granted the reexam request , the Patent Office noted that the Jungleib book raises a substantial issue of patentability — as do two other sources .
The reexamination does n't ensure any particular outcome , but most patents that undergo reexamination do have their claims at least narrowed , while others are thrown out altogether .
EFF has already gotten one patent tossed , but there 's little more it can do now to speed the five other pending reexaminations along .
As Michael Kwun explained to me , " The other five are at various stages in the reexam process .
Each of those five reexams is a so - called ex parte reexamination .
That means , for the most part , that the rest of the reexamination is conducted between the PTO and the patentee .
There is another form of reexamination , called an inter partes reexamination , in which the requester [ EFF ] can continue to participate in the reexamination proceedings on an ongoing basis , but that type of reexamination can only take place with respect to newer patents . "
For now , then , it 's wait and see — and prepare the next reexam request .
But simply gaining a reexamination is a significant victory , one that lets the " EFF marshals " slap another red stamp across another broad patent .
e Bay user , petermanart , tried to sell his aribrushed car for $ 20,000 USD .
He only had 1 offer for $ 12,000 which he declined .
The art on this car is very well done , but I ’m not sure anyone would want to be caught riding around in a Star Wars fanboy type car .
Especially a Chevy Colbalt .
It ’s a shame that all that hard work and great art was wasted on a crappy car .

The Bible Retranslation Project recognizes two fundamental aspects of a modern language that causes it to be a constant state of flux or change :
familiar terms change their meanings , so text using them becomes misinterpretable
new , more precise terms appear at a rate of about 1000 per year . [ 1 ]
Terms that were clear and meaningful to one generation are often unclear and less meaningful to the next ; meanwhile , entirely new terms are constantly emerging , some of which may facilitate more precise translation from the Biblical Greek and Hebrew ( and Aramaic in the case of parts of the books of Ezra / Nehemya and Daniel ) .
One really simple example is the word " let . "
The original meaning of " let " was the same as " hinder , " as in " If they are able to work , and refuse , then they may go hungry without let . "
Later this word 's meaning changed to " allow " .
Both effects above — due to culture and the emergence of new terms — may be increasing as communications increase .
If a word inevitably alters its meaning after an approximate number of uses , then the time period for the change in meaning will shorten due to improved technology , just as the length of a sound bite likewise shortens .
Likewise , the rate of emergence of new terms may be directly correlated to the frequency of communication .
In the internet era , combating the effect of language degradation and creation on the understanding of the Bible becomes more important .
But there is an economic obstacle to developing a translation of the Bible that remains current with changes in language .
Book sales have been declining sharply due to the internet , and it is probably not easy to recoup the substantial costs ( $ 10 million for the Holman Christian Standard Bible ) that are required to develop a new translation .
With the need to recoup and enormous investment , publishers of a new Bible are probably overly cautious in changing familiar terminology despite erosion in their meaning , in fear of criticism and a poor reception .
A lower - cost and more dynamic approach is needed to combat the effects of persistent degradations in language .
As a first step to the Bible Retranslation Project , it is useful to identify modern terms having changing , unclear or altered meaning , which appear in important passages in translations of the Bible into the corresponding modern language .
This will help avoid cliché and the repetition of culturally - familiar but suboptimal passages while producing a superior rendition from the original Hebrew and Greek into idiomatic modern English .
Emergent New Terms
Powerful new terms develop that were unknown or underutilized at the time of prior translations of the Bible into English .
The English language , relatively weak at its beginning , continues to develop by adding insightful new terminology .
These more precise and meaningful concepts should be utilized by English translations of the Bible .
The King James Version was written in the early 1600s , and powerful terminology has been added to the English language since then , some in the past decade .
Examples include :
New Term First Developed Potential Uses in a Bible Retranslation bias censor 1882 conservative 1831 gamble 1775 After Jesus released His spirit at the Crucifixion , English translations should now state that the Roman soldiers " gambled " to win his clothing , rather than the less clear statement that they " cast lots . "
See Matt 27:35 ; Mark 15:24 ; Luke 23:34 ; John 19:24 .[ 2 ] homeschool 1980s relevant to Jesus teaching the younger Apostles media 1841 [ 3 ] relevant to prohibition against false idols moral majority 1979 self - centered 1764 socialism 1827 [ 4 ] status worship welfare ( by govt ) 1904 work ethic 1951 Relevant to the parable of the talents unprincipled 1644
Examples
Original Term English Translation Usage Lack of Clarity Real meaning Suggested Improvement Hebrew יהוה צבאות transliteration : " YHWH Tsvaot " " LORD of hosts " " Whereas Edom saith , We are impoverished , but we will return and build the desolate places ; thus saith the LORD of hosts ,
They shall build , but I will throw down ; and they shall call them , The border of wickedness , and , The people against whom the LORD hath indignation for ever . "
Malachi 1:4 ( KJV )
The word " Tsvaot " means " armies " in Hebrew .
While the words " hosts " was used as " armies " in the seventeenth century , many people do not perceive that word in such a manner today .
[ 1 ] LORD of armies .
LORD of armies .
Hebrew בני ישראל transliteration : " Bnei Israel " " Children of Israel " " And the LORD did that thing on the morrow , and all the cattle of Egypt died : but of the cattle of the children of Israel died not one . "
Exodus 9:6 ( KJV )
The word " Bnei " means " sons of " in Hebrew , not children .
Sons of Israel , sometimes used to refer to the literal sons of Jacob , most of the times used as a title for the entire nation of Israel .
Sons of Israel .
When used as a title for the nation of Israel , always capitalize the word " Sons " .
In the rare instances in which is refers to the literal sons of Jacob , the word sons should not be capitalized so long as it does not appear in the beginning of a sentence .
Greek λόγο ς transliteration : " logos " " word " " In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God . " John 1:1 ( NIV ) " Word " now means a short utterance of a single concept , which can include a vulgarity or a falsehood underlying logic or profound statement of the truth replace " Word " with " Truth " [ 5 ] הָֽאָדָם ( note the definite article ! )
" Adam " Gen 2 &c .
It 's often transliterated into Adam rather than just kept as the man / person / human being .
The connotation needs to be that of humanity rather than maleness ; anthropos rather than aner ; homo rather than vir .
I feel this loses the sense of הָֽאָדָם as an Everyman , a universal figure prototypical of humanity .
One might note also that חַוָּ ה " Eve " , whilst it is undoubtedly a name , needs the connotaion of life ( חָֽי ) to adequately convey meaning to a reader .
The man / person / human being χάρι ς " grace " " From the fullness of his grace we have all received one blessing after another . "
John 1:16 ( NIV ) " grace " has become a female name and a sports term to refer primarily to smoothness in style spiritual and majestic gift - giving replace some instances of " grace " with " boundless generosity " Tahhash " badger " Describing the skins used in the construction of the Tabernacle
It 's now thought that this is certainly not a badger ( or not a Melis one ) Possibly " Hirax " , though I 'm not up on the most recent theories on this .
One for an expert , I think .
מִּשְׂרָה " government " " For to us a child is born , to us a son is given , and the government will be on his shoulders .
...
Of the increase of his government and peace there will be no end . "
Isaiah 9:6-7 ( NIV ) " government " now means officials paid by mandatory taxes and accountable to a democratic vote spiritual kingdom replace " government " with " kingdom " - I dislike this - I do n't think that monarchy metaphors are really as strong or as relevant as they used to be in the days of the ubiquity absolute rulers .
Also " kingdom " is an area of land , I think we want something like " rulership " ?
Though that sounds a bit ugly .
Dominion , perhaps ?
Greek εἰρήνη transliteration : " eirene " " peace " " ...
Jesus came and stood among them and said , ' Peace be with you ! ' " John 20:19 ( NIV ) [ 6 ] " peace " now means an absence of war an inner peace and lack of personal fear or anxiety replace " peace " with " tranquility " - but this then gives possible issues for verses like I Kings 20:18 , which now reads
And he said , Whether they be come out for tranquility , take them alive ; or whether they be come out for war , take them alive .
Perhaps we could keep " peace " for shalom , and " tranquility " for eirene ?
Except Jesus , saying " Peace be with you " , is presumably using shalom alechem , or Aramaic cognate , which leads to some interesting issues of consistency .
Response : The Hebrew " Shalom " and Greek " Eirene " mean the same thing , which can be either a political state of peace ( not at war ) or a personal state of peace .
If someone says " I 'm at peace now " , that means more than just they 're not at war .
So I object to the premise .
We do need a better word to distinguish the two , but that word does n't exist in Hebrew , Greek , or English ( at least not as one word ) .
Greek πλούσιο ς transliteration : " plousios " : " abundantly supplied " [ 7 ] [ 8 ] " rich " " It is easier for a camel to pass through the eye of a needle , than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of heaven " ( Matthew 19:24 ) nearly everyone is " abundantly supplied " today with food and entertainment , and " rich " has come to mean relative wealth without any absolute significance ; continued use of " rich " is misleading in justifying laziness and socialism miserliness to the point of laziness and being unproductive " fully fed and entertained " or " idle miser , " or something similar .
[ 9 ] " behemoth " Job 40:15 - 24 beasts ( sing. behemah ) " kill " " Thou shalt not kill " Exodus 20.13 ( KJV )
In Biblical times , as today , the bearing of arms to defend ones family and society was the hallmark of Judeo - Christian civilization .
The commandment referred to unjustifiable homicides - murder and manslaughter - rather than advocating blanket pacifism , as many Leftists today interpret it .
to murder or take up arms without sufficient justification replace " kill " with " commit murder " depending on the original text and the context - it'd not be sensible to use murder in the context of an animal doing it , for instance !
עֲנָו ( `anav ) " meek " " Blessed are the meek : for they shall inherit the earth " Matthew 5:5 ( KJV ) / Ps 37 " meek " now means excessively mild , passive , pathetically submissive .
showing humility before God replace " meek " with " God- fearing " " Mahlon " and " Chilion " ( e.g. ) Ruth 1:2 Mahlon and Chilion The Hebrew forms mean nothing to a modern reader " Weak " and " Sick " I think we could afford to be bold and translate these names .
Footnotes are a cowardly choice .
If we had the name of his two sons were Feeble and Poorly , it 'd make much more of an impression .
Response : A lot of Hebrew names in the Old Testament , particularly in the Book of Ruth , have translations .
For instance , Esau means " hairy " .
We can't really translate all of them .
The Book of Ruth is full of these more so than any other book .
Naomi ( " my delight " ) asks to be called Mara ( " the bitter one " ) , Orpah means " gazelle " and comes from the root meaning " back of the neck " , appropriate given how she turns her back on the people , Boaz means " fleetness " , and Obed means " servant " .
We really can't translate all of these or it becomes nonsense .
Where do we draw the line ?
I prefer footnotes , at least in the Old Testament which is so ripe with these names with literal meanings .
" liberal " " The liberal soul shall be made fat : and he that watereth shall be watered also himself " Proverbs 11:25 ( KJV ) " liberal " now means adhering to leftist or socialistic political or social doctrines showing generosity replace " liberal " with " generous " , in line with most modern English versions Greek ᾅδο υ transliteration : haidou , " Hades " " depths " " No , you will go down to the depths .
If the miracles that were performed in you had been performed in Sodom , it would have remained to this day . "
Matthew 11:23 ( NIV ) " depths " is now understood to mean the ocean .
" Hades " was used by Matthew to help Greeks comprehend Christianity 's Hell .
The LXX use " haidon " in Psalm 115 to translate the Hebrew " dumah " , so it 's applicable to other concepts as well .
Hell / depths of Hell replace " depths " with " Hell " - " shall be brought down to hell . "
( KJV )
How then do we distinguish between haides and geenna ( sticking to the Gk. for the moment ) ?
Perhaps keep haides for the general realm of the dead , and geenna for a place of punishment ?
That seems to me to be the difference in nuance .
Greek πα ραδίδωμι transliteration : paradidōmi " gave up " " ... he bowed his head and gave up his spirit . "
John 19:30 ( NIV ) [ 10 ] " gave up " has a newer meaning , attested in the OED since the eighteenth century : [ 11 ] it now means to quit and stop trying , or surrender .
It has acquired a negative connotation .
" relinquish " is a term that avoids ambiguiity and possible negative connotation .
replace " gave up " with " released " or " relinquished "

Verse Translation Discussion and notes וַיְהִי בִּימֵי אֲחַשְׁוֵרוֹש הוּא אֲחַשְׁוֵרוֹשׁ הַמֹּלֵךְ מֵהֹדּוּ וְעַד-כּוּשׁ--שֶׁבַע וְעֶשְׂרִים וּמֵאָה מְדִינָ ה
And it was , in the days of Ahhashverosh - this being the Ahhashverosh reigning all the way from India to Ethiopia , a hundred and twenty - seven provinces , How do people want to transliterate אֲחַשְׁוֵרוֹשׁ ?
We could do with someone up on Persian history , really .
Anyone ?
I 've used " provinces " for מְדִינָה , though I 'm very open to suggestions !
Also is " all the way from ... to " too colloquial , and is it justified by the text ?
Does הֹדּוּ really signify India , historically ?
Answer :
Since this is the only mention to my knowledge of India in that time period 's Hebrew , I do n't know about historically .
But in modern Hebrew , it has always referred to India .
I 'm guessing that 's from this verse .
It 's the best answer we have .
בַּיָּמִים הָהֵם--כְּשֶׁבֶת הַמֶּלֶךְ אֲחַשְׁוֵרוֹשׁ עַל כִּסֵּא מַלְכוּתוֹ אֲשֶׁר בְּשׁוּשַׁן הַבִּירָה in those days , when the king Ahhashverosh sat on his throne , in the city of Shushan , is " his throne " OK for kise malkhuto ?
I 've gone with " capital " for בִּירָה which I think reads neatly .
( Would it be alright to translate Shushan as Susa , or is that too much of a leap ? )
Response : Kise malkhuto literally means " royal chair " .
I think we can understand that to mean a throne .
Also , Shushan was not the capital , it was where the King lived in the summer when the capital got too hot .
Updated response : That Hebrew word my computer is incapable of typing means " in the city " , so I 'll replace my palace edit with city .
" Iyra " , ( Ayin - Yud - Resh - Hay ) means a generic city , but " Be'er " or " Berah " refers to a specific city .
See multiple Israel cities such as Beer Shevah .
בִּשְׁנַת שָׁלוֹשׁ לְמָלְכוֹ עָשָׂה מִשְׁתֶּה לְכָל - שָׂרָיו וַעֲבָדָיו חֵיל פָּרַס וּמָדַי הַפַּרְתְּמִים וְשָׂרֵי הַמְּדִינוֹת-- לְפָנָיו in the third year of his reign , he made a drinking - party for all his ministers and his subjects .
The warriors of Persia and Media , the aristocrats , and the ministers of the provinces were in his presence , ( Media here refers to the region of that name , not to the plural form of medium ) בְּהַרְאֹתוֹ , אֶת - עֹשֶׁר כְּבוֹד מַלְכוּתוֹ וְאֶת - יְקָר תִּפְאֶרֶת גְּדוּלָּתוֹ יָמִים רַבִּים שְׁמוֹנִים וּמְאַת יוֹם when he showed the wealth of the glory of his kingdom and his glorious splendor and magnificence for many days , 180 days .
( " glorious splendor and magnificence " - HALOT s.v. יְקָר entry 1 ; ref. Est 1:4 ) וּבִמְלוֹאת הַיָּמִים הָאֵלֶּה עָשָׂה הַמֶּלֶךְ לְכָל - הָעָם הַנִּמְצְאִים בְּשׁוּשַׁן הַבִּירָה לְמִגָּדוֹל וְעַד - קָטָן מִשְׁתֶּה--שִׁבְעַת יָמִים בַּחֲצַר גִּנַּת בִּיתַן הַמֶּלֶך ְ
And when these days were fulfilled ( completed ) , the king gave , to all the people that were found in Shushan , from the greatest to the least , a drinking party seven days long in the court of the garden of the king 's palace .
Something along the lines of " when this period ended " should work , instead of " when these days were fulfilled ( completed ) " .
( " palace " - HALOT s.v. בִּיתַן ; ref. Est 1:5 , 7:7,8 ; three usages total , all " palace . " ) הוּר כַּרְפַּס וּתְכֵלֶת אָחוּז בְּחַבְלֵי - בוּץ וְאַרְגָּמָן , עַל - גְּלִילֵי כֶסֶף , וְעַמּוּדֵי שֵׁשׁ ; מִטּוֹת זָהָב וָכֶסֶף , עַל רִצְפַת בַּהַט -וָשֵׁשׁ--וְדַר וְסֹחָרֶ ת
There were white and violet linens held by purple linen ropes on silver rings and marble columns ; couches of gold and silver on a flagstone pavement of ( red stone ) , marble , ( mother - of - pearl or a stone like pearl ) , and precious ( black ) stones .
This is going to be hard to say , but a lot of this stuff is certainly not modern .
Although the white and violet linen and purple cords , the silver rings and the marble ( possibly alabaster ) columns , and the silver and gold couches ( or beds ) all work ( I think ... the silver and gold couches might present a problem . )
The real problem arrives when you get to the stones .
The בַּהַט , דַר , and סֹחָרֶת are all used only once in Esther .
The usage of שֵׁשׁ as " white marble " only occurs three times , all in Esther .
All other times it is used as " linen " or " fine linen " .
If you want , you can go ahead and reduce the flagstone pavement to " multicolored " , if it suits you .

Verse [ 12 ] Translation Discussion and notes
Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγο ς καὶ ὁ λόγο ς ἦν πρὸ ς τὸν θε όν καὶ θεὸ ς ἦν ὁ λόγο ς
In the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God .
It is curious , though not necessarily meaningful , how the Greek inverts the order of God and the " Word " at the end of this all - important sentence .
References
There ’s been a lot of noise in recent years about the widespread construction of Wal - Marts and other big box stores .
A new development is the rise in vacated megastores .
Recently , resourceful communities and individuals are re-imagining better uses for these behemoth structures .
A body of data and stories has been collected by Julia Christensen , author of the recently published Big Box Reuse .
Her book , published by MIT Press , offers a detailed overview of ten communities that have transformed vacated Wal - Marts and Kmarts into civic structures .
In many cases , store sales were n’t bad ; business just demanded additional space , and it ’s easier to build another cookie - cutter Supercenter than to add on to an existing store .
The new buildings , some of which which can comfortably fit four NFL football fields , are often erected just down the road .
Keeping the Commandment
Why is reusing these stores such a big deal ?
The short answer is that a lot of natural resources have been used and destroyed for their construction , and since communities need to do something with the shells , their most sustainable alternative is to find the best use of the space ( as long as someone is willing to upkeep those mammoth roofs ) .
If we must “ reduce , reuse , and recycle ” to combat waste , then big box reuse is keeping the commandment on the macro level .
The most typical scenario is for a church , school , or community center to move into the vacated stores .
Among the more interesting reconfigurations are the Spam Museum , in Austin , Minnesota , and an indoor Go-kart track , in Round Rock , Texas .
Christensen ’s research did n’t stop with those ten success stories .
At the web site BigBoxReuse.com , she has provided a cool resource called wikireuse , which is open for the public to post local stories about reuse projects .
By last count , there were over 20 reports of reuse projects .
The Best Reuse Design
In November , a team of experts recruited by the Washington Post was inspired by Christensen ’s project to let their imaginations run wild and repurpose our “ temples of consumption , ” as reporter Joel Garreau calls them .
Artists , architects , engineers , and developers sketched out their best ideas with brief explanations to reuse “ our most common , underrated and increasingly available major buildings . ”

I personally liked the one labeled “ The Garden of Gaithersburg . ”
Architect Daniel Rippeteau imagines that holes can be punched into the parking lot ’s asphalt to make way for an orchard planting .
He also knows that running underneath that parking lot is a vast drainage pipe system ( originally installed by the big box developer to prevent wet and icy conditions ) .
Those pipes can be reused to collect rainwater and redirect it inside the building to irrigate the enormous greenhouse that Rippeteau has imagined , complete with pre-installed sprinklers ( formerly a fire sprinkler system ) .

You have to wonder what goes through the minds of the people who write this stuff today .
It ’s so over the top as to suggest a subversive intent .
KCNA ’s words , my links :
Pyongyang , February 4 ( KCNA ) —
Upon hearing the news that General Secretary Kim Jong
Il was nominated as a candidate for deputy to the 12th Supreme People ’s Assembly at Constituency No. 333 , the entire army and people are full of great happiness and pride of having the peerlessly great man as the leader of the nation .
Anti-Japanese revolutionary fighter Hwang Sun Hui said that the anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters were very happy to hear the news .
She went on :
A few days ago the officers and men of the People ’s Army nominated Kim Jong
Il as a candidate for deputy to the SPA with boundless reverence .
This is the unanimous will and ardent desire of the entire people .
On receiving this happy news with the February 16 , the greatest holiday of the nation , ahead , I can hardly repress the swelling emotion .
We anti-Japanese revolutionary fighters will uphold the leader ’s plan of building a great , prosperous and powerful nation in the van of the people .
Vice - premier of the DPRK Cabinet Thae Jong Su , noting that having nominated Kim Jong
Il as a candidate for deputy to the SPA this time again is the unanimous will of the entire army and people and a great auspicious event of the nation , said :
Kim Jong
Il has been leading the Party and the revolution along one road of victory for scores of years , thus performing great feats which will remain immortal in the history of the country .
He is the peerlessly great man who has defended firmly and developed in depth President Kim Il Sung ’s Juche - oriented idea and line on state building and demonstrated the dignity and might of the DPRK all over the world with his original Songun politics .
All the officers and men of the People ’s Army and the people came to have as a firm faith through life that he is the destiny and future of our country and nation and the symbol of all the victories .

Clumps on one of Phoenix ’s legs were observed to grow over time ( see next image for side - by - side pictures ) ( Image : NASA / JPL - Caltech / University of Arizona / Max Planck Institute )
One of the clumps on Phoenix ’s leg ( right in white box ) appears to grow after apparently absorbing the liquid from its neighbour .
The images were taken on the 8th , 31st and 44th Martian days ( or sols ) of the Phoenix mission ( Image : NASA / JPL - Caltech / University of Arizona / Max Planck Institute )

NASA ’s Phoenix lander may have captured the first images of liquid water on Mars – droplets that apparently splashed onto the spacecraft ’s leg during landing , according to some members of the Phoenix team .
The controversial observation could be explained by the mission ’s previous discovery of perchlorate salts in the soil , since the salts can keep water liquid at sub-zero temperatures .
Researchers say this antifreeze effect makes it possible for liquid water to be widespread just below the surface of Mars , but point out that even if it is there , it may be too salty to support life as we know it .
A few days after Phoenix landed on 25 May 2008 , it sent back an image showing mysterious splotches of material attached to one of its legs .
Strangely , the splotches grew in size over the next few weeks , and Phoenix scientists have been debating the origin of the objects ever since .
One intriguing possibility is that they were droplets of salty water that grew by absorbing water vapour from the atmosphere .
Arguments for this idea are laid out in a study by Phoenix team member Nilton Renno of the University of Michigan in Ann Arbor , and co-authored by 21 other researchers , including the mission ’s chief scientist , Peter Smith of the University of Arizona in Tucson .
The study ( pdf ) will be presented in March at the Lunar and Planetary Science Conference in Houston , Texas .
Widespread water
Gaping canyons and river - like channels attest to the fact that large amounts of liquid water once flowed on Mars .
The surface now appears dry , though the changing appearance of some crater gullies over a period of several years has hinted at the existence of subsurface aquifers that occasionally release bursts of water .
Certainly , at Phoenix ’s landing site in the Martian arctic , it is too cold for pure water to exist in liquid form – the temperature never rose above - 20° C during the five - month - long mission .
But salty water can stay liquid at much lower temperatures .
And perchlorate salts , which were detected for the first time on Mars by Phoenix , would have an especially dramatic ‘ antifreeze ’ effect .
An extremely salty mixture of water and perchlorates could stay liquid all the way down to - 70° C .
If perchlorates are widespread on Mars at high concentrations , then pockets of liquid water might also be widespread below the planet ’s surface .
“ According to my calculations , you can have liquid saline solutions just below the surface almost anywhere on Mars , ” Renno told New Scientist .
And Phoenix may have already snapped images of water kept liquid thanks to perchlorate salts .
Melted ice
The clumps may have come from ice melted by the lander ’s thrusters .
Phoenix ’s thrusters cleared away the topsoil at the landing site , exposing an ice layer below .
Laboratory experiments the team carried out on Earth suggest the thrusters would have melted the top millimetre or so of this layer and then could have splashed the melted water onto the lander ’s leg .
If enough perchlorate was mixed into the droplets , they could have stayed liquid during the daytime , though they may have frozen each night .
Alternatively , Renno says the clumps may have come from a thin layer of perchlorate - rich water that was already liquid .
Why does the team think the clumps might be liquid water in the first place ?
The argument rests on the fact that salt is hygroscopic , meaning it attracts water .
So droplets of salty fluid on Mars would tend to absorb water vapour from the atmosphere , explaining why the clumps grew over time .
Indeed , at the temperatures and humidity observed at the Phoenix site , the expected growth rate of salty droplets matches the observations , the team says .
Most provocatively , a series of images ( pictured here ) appears to show one candidate droplet growing after absorbing the liquid from its neighbour – a behaviour the team ascribes to liquid water .
‘ Convincing story ’
Mark Bullock of the Southwest Research Institute in Boulder , Colorado , who has experimented with salty water under Martian conditions but was not involved in Renno ’s study , is impressed with the results .
“ I think it makes a pretty convincing story for the existence of exotic brines on the Phoenix lander leg , ” he told New Scientist .
But Phoenix team member Michael Hecht of NASA ’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena , California , disagrees .
He says the clumps were probably patches of ice that formed and grew from water vapour freezing onto the leg .
Renno counters that ice would be more likely to sublimate than grow on the leg , which would have been warmed by heat leaking from the spacecraft ’s body .
Indeed , the layer of ice exposed beneath Phoenix was observed to vaporise over time .
But Hecht argues that the leg may have been colder than its surroundings .
Though there were no temperature sensors on the leg , he says the surface of the ice patch was warmed by direct sunlight , whereas the lander leg was in shadow .
Water vapour that sublimated from the ice below Phoenix might have recondensed as ice on its cold leg , he argues .
Too salty for life ?
Phoenix , which ran out of solar power five months after landing , is not expected to wake up again , so there is no way to further investigate the bumps on its leg .
But Renno hopes to bolster the case for salty droplets with future experiments on perchlorate - rich water under Mars - like conditions .
He says those tests should be completed in a few months .
Regardless of their outcome , the discovery of perchlorates in the Martian soil suggests that pockets of liquid water may dot the planet .
Could life eke out an existence in such pockets ?
“ It ’s possible , ” Renno says , pointing out that there are microorganisms on Earth that can survive extreme conditions , including very salty water .
But it may be difficult .
One way to describe salt concentrations is with a number called the water activity , which is 1 for pure water , and smaller for saltier solutions .
The most salt - tolerant organism known on Earth is a fungus that can survive down to a water activity of 0.61 .
However , to lower water ’s freezing point all the way down to - 70 °C with perchlorates , the necesssary concentration of perchlorate salts would give a water activity of just 0.5 .
“ If you tried to put any kind of life - form you can imagine on Earth in a brine solution of that sort , the water would be sucked out of the cells , ” mission leader Peter Smith told New Scientist .

Judge : ' Troopergate ' probe against Palin can continue RAW STORY
Published : Friday October 3 , 2008
Print This Email This Alaska lawmakers can continue investigating whether Gov. Sarah Palin abused her power in firing a state public safety commissioner who refused to fire her former brother - in - law , a judge ruled Thursday .
Bloomberg News reports :
In his ruling yesterday , issued minutes before the start of the vice - presidential debate , Alaska state court Judge Peter Michalski said the Alaska Legislative Council can move ahead with its investigation , including having the state Senate Judiciary Committee subpoena Palin aides to testify .
" It is legitimately within the scope of the Legislature 's investigatory power to inquire into the circumstances surrounding the termination of a public officer , " Michalski wrote in his ruling .
Republicans in Alaska had sought to end the probe , arguing that it has become infected with politics .
Republican presidential nominee John McCain tapped Palin to be his running mate .
The judge 's decision on the probe came just a few hours before Thursday night 's debate between Palin and Democratic VP nominee Joe Biden .
The trooper - firing investigation was not mentioned during the debate .
The probe began before Palin 's rise to the national stage .
State lawmakers hired an investigator to determine whether Palin acted improperly in allegedly pressuring Public Safety Commissioner Walt Monegan to fire her brother in law and then firing Monegan when he refused to comply .
The governor 's office says budget disputes led to Monegan 's firing .
The Associated Press has more on the investigation .
The independent investigator , retired prosecutor Steven Branchflower , now can conclude the probe and report his findings by Oct. 10 .
Branchflower has not interviewed Palin 's husband Todd and several top aides who have refused to appear under subpoena .
It was not immediately clear whether they now would testify .
It remains to be seen whether the investigation 's findings will turn into this year 's " October surprise " in the presidential campaign .
A few days ago I got my first Python project .
I ’d like to share references I ’ve found , and what I like or dislike about the language .
I hope to give insight to would - be Python dabblers and ideas to current Pythoneers .
Good resources I ’ve found
I have found some good resources online for Python and Jython , but I know I did n’t find them all so if you Python - istas could put some in the comments I ’d be very grateful :)
What I like so far
I like that a lot of common operations are very easy .
Take for example :
# 3 Hellos in Python hellos = ' Hello ' * 3
as opposed to
// 3 Hellos in Java String hellos = " " ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < 3 ; i ++ ) { hellos += " Hello " ; }
There are a bunch of other features that come to mind , like string formatting , list manipulation , and variable and default - valued arguments .
Oh , and of course closures are very straightforward :
def outer ( your_name ) : title = random .
choice ( [ " Mr " , " Mrs " , " Miss " ] ) def greeter ( greeting ) : print greeting , title , your_name return greeter g = outer ( " Eric " ) # invoke it # g now contains a reference to the inner function , but as it references variables # from the local scope of outer , the invocation data has been stored in a closure # Execution of outer is finished , but g can still reference its local variables through # the closure : g ( " Hi " ) # prints " Hi Mr. Eric " :D
I could go on and on , but you really ought to read the documentation to see all of its features .
Actually there ’s not all that much to it !
Troubles I have with it
I wish I could find more documentation with simple code examples .
I ’m sure there are a bunch of blog posts out there but it ’d be nice if there were more included with the documentation .
Passing arguments by reference does n’t seem to be possible , which is fine , but different .
I ’m not totally used to the lack of curly braces , but I like the fact that you must have good formatting to have runnable Python .
I was surprised to learn that Python is strongly typed which in some way I think is odd because it seems like it ’d be simpler if it was weakly typed .
a = " 17 " b = 25 print a + b # Nope !
One last thing is classes .
I ’m not sure I have my head around how they really work in Python .
I ’m sure I ’ll get the hang of it soon .
Conclusion
Overall I ’m thoroughly impressed with the language .
There almost seems to be a Zen - like aura around Python code that is written with the simplicity the language creators intended .
Obviously I still have a lot to learn , so please help me out if you have some advice in the comments !
Elana Schor has a post this morning showing the four Senate Republicans who appear to be in play for President Obama on the Stimulus Bill , based on their vote last night on Sen.
DeMint ’s alternative Stimulus Bill .
But there ’s something else last night ’s vote tells us .
There were 36 out of 41 Republican senators who voted to scrap all spending in the Stimulus Bill .
All of it .
This approaches flat earth territory in terms of where the economy is right now and what conventional macroeconomics suggests about how to combat the problem .
Late Update : TPM Reader MH ain’t happy …
This whole netbook thing is rapidly getting out of hand , and we 're fast approaching a situation where every last company ( including ODMs ) in any corner of the PC or mobile space will have jumped on the netbook bandwagon .
A case in point is Nokia , which , faced with tanking revenues in its high - margin handset business , is making ever - louder noises about getting into laptops .
In an interview with Finnish TV summarized by Reuters , Nokia did n't appear to use the n-word ( we have n't seen a full transcript , though ) , but there was plenty of talk of PCs and mobiles converging , and how Nokia is " looking very actively " at this convergence .
The question that the report leaves open is " what kind of ' laptop ' is Nokia considering ? "
The obvious answer would be that Nokia plans to jump into the PC market with an Atom - based netbook , and that may well be the case .
But we could just as easily see the company using a combination of ARM and Linux to squeeze itself onto the incredibly crowded netbook bandwagon .
It all depends on Nokia 's timing .
If the planned mobile is a near - term product for 2009 or even 2010 , then Atom or Intel 's upcoming Moorestown makes the most sense .
The only near - term ARM options could power a " netbook " device with a very lightweight , highly optimized mobile Linux stack that 's basically a Web tablet (? la the N810 ) with a full - sized screen and keyboard .
This does n't seem that compelling , though .
But if the target date is 2011 , it will probably be ARM - based in order to leverage Nokia 's substantial investments in ARM hardware and software , and in an ARM - based supply chain .
Given Nokia 's recent moves , we 're leaning towards the idea that Nokia will release an ARM - based netbook in 2011 , instead of ( or in addition to ) a more traditional Intel - based netbook .
Here 's why .
Nokia 's Linux push
Nokia has invested considerable resources in building a robust Linux - based platform for ARM .
The Maemo operating system , which is used on the company 's Internet Tablet devices , provides a relatively complete stack that could easily be adapted to run on a laptop .
The next generation of the Maemo platform is being built to run on OMAP3 and is designed to leverage the chip 's more robust processing power .
Unlike the current generation of Internet Tablet devices , the next generation will get much closer to a laptop - like experience in terms of performance .
Going from an ARM - based touchscreen tablet to an ARM - based netbook is n't such a big jump when you look at the capabilities that Maemo 5 is being engineered to deliver .
Another factor worth considering is the Ubuntu ARM port .
Nokia sponsored a group called the Handheld Mojo team that developed an unofficial Ubuntu port for ARM processors .
Canonical , the company behind Ubuntu , recently announced its own official ARM port which will be made available when Ubuntu 9.04 is released in April .
Canonical has also put a lot of effort into developing user interfaces that are specifically tailored for netbooks .
So Nokia could adapt Maemo to make it netbook - friendly , it could adopt the Ubuntu ARM port , or it could create a hybrid that leverages components of both .
The hybrid possibility is n't as far - fetched as it sounds in this case , as there is a lot of overlap between the technologies that are used in Ubuntu and in Maemo .
Both are Debian - based platforms , and they 're both closely tied to the GNOME ecosystem .
There are a lot of shared components at many different layers of the stack .
The hardware possibilities
In terms of the processor , the two most obvious candidates for ARM - based Nokia netbooks are the OMAP 3 and OMAP 4 processor families from TI .
The OMAP 3 family is just now starting to make its way out into the market in force , and its highest - profile design win to date is Palm 's forthcoming Pre .
We wo n't describe OMAP 3 here , since we 've covered it in previous Palm coverage , but it 's worth noting that it 's a relatively weak netbook candidate .
With only one in - order Cortex A8 core , the OMAP 3 series is much more suited to phones and PMPs than it is to an actual " netbook " - caliber device .
A case in point is this recent Engadget post , which shows the OMAP 3 struggling under the strain of Windows Mobile 6.5 .
Of course , TI will migrate the next entry in the OMAP 3 family , the 3600 series , to a 45nm fab process , and this will boost performance while cutting power consumption .
The company also claims a major boost in graphics performance for this newer series , due out next year , but the degree to which it touts 720p HD video decoding in its press release indicates that most of this boost is in the video decode department .
Still , they should also see some bump in overall performance , from the increase in clockspeed and from improvements to the GPU core .
A much more likely candidate for a Nokia netbook is the OMAP 4 series , which was just announced earlier this month .
OMAP 4 will also be 45nm , and its line sports a dual - core Cortex A9 along with a GPU by PowerVR .
Clockspeeds on these parts will go above 1GHz on the top end , and they should easily be capable of powering a Linux - based netbook .
TI OMAP 4 block diagram .
Source : TI
These chips probably wo n't go into production until the second half of this year , and they 'll start showing up in devices in 2011 .
By that time , rival Intel will be well into the " tock " cycle of its newly accelerated 32nm production , and should be starting on 22nm parts .
Intel 's 32nm Moorestown successors will be very cheap to produce and sell , and will give a 32nm OMAP 4 a run for its money .
Ultimately , though we consider an ARM - based Linux netbook to be Nokia 's most likely entry into the netbook market , an Intel - based product from the phonemaker remains a distinct possibility .
Nokia 's combination of industrial design prowess , wireless provider relationships , and manufacturing music could turn the low - cost Atom platform into a fairly compelling netbook product , albeit one that would have a hard time standing out in an increasingly crowded field .

Enjoy the finest pink couch session yet .
Say you are browsing , ahem , stuff on the Internet that you are n’t supposed to see and somebody walks into the room .
We have discussed this scenario before and provided you with 10 different boss - keys to choose from – programs that hide any open windows with the hit of a key .
Also recall the previously mentioned Ghostzilla that let your browse from within any application and hide it in a flash .
But lets talk about Firefox in particular and what it ’s numerous addons has to offer .
1. TabRenamizer is a Firefox extension that is useful in cases when the person walking into the room is n’t too intrusive .
He or she just glances at the titles of the opened tab on your screen and walks away .
TabRenamizer allows you to get away by disguising the tab names .
With a quick keyboard shortcut you can change the tab titles to a random one selected from a predefined set .
The set of titles that you wish to display when you activate this addon can be created and customized at leisure from the addon ’s settings window .
You can also activate it from the tools menu but the hotkey is faster .
But remember that the page does n’t change , only the tab titles does .
2. Page Title Eraser is a similar addon that lets you hide the title of the tabs , but this one is odd .
It can hide the title of only the active tab .
It ’s pretty useless if you have several tabs open that you want to hide .
Also the shortcut combination is ridiculously long ( Shift + Alt + Ctrl+H ) and can not be changed .
3. hideBad extension quickly saves the current browsing session , closes it and opens the default homepage with a hotkey .
It also clears the browser ’s history , cache , search entries and other stuff .
4. Panic Button is for situations when you need to panic – you need to hide all open browser windows because you are n’t supposed to be browsing the net at all and getting caught in the act can lead to dire consequences .
With Panic Button installed , a single click of on a toolbar button or a keyboard shortcut will quickly hide , minimize or altogether quit all Firefox windows .
When you choose the Hide option , you can recover the session by clicking a button on the Restore Session toolbar .
But of course , you can recover the session automatically when you quit the browser too .
5. Panic is similar to Panic Button but instead of closing all tabs or the whole browser which looks suspicious , it closes the opened tabs and then opens another tab with a page you choose .
This looks like as if you were browsing a different site and not just staring at the blank desktop .
6 . Distrust creates a silent browsing session during which it monitors all activities in Firefox , picks up all surfing trail that you leave behind , and then flushes them out when the Distrust session is turned off .
All history items and cached pages during this session is removed from the browser and leave the computer as it was before the browsing session began .
( Original post )
Firefox3 users , download the latest version from here since the Mozilla page is still not updated .
7 . Stealther is another extension that does pretty much the same thing Distrust does .
On activation Stealther will temporarily disable the following :
– Browsing History ( also in Address bar )
– Cookies
– Downloaded Files History
– Disk Cache
– Saved Form Information
– Sending of ReferrerHeader
– Recently Closed Tabs list
8 . Close ’n forget has even better stealth properties .
When you visit a page and want to remove it ’s tracks from the history simply use a special close button that this addon installs on the toolbar instead of the regular close tab button .
Doing so will close the active tab and with it wipe out all cookies from the domain of the closed page .
The number of deleted cookies is briefly displayed in the status bar .
You can choose whether you want to delete all cookies under the domain or only the cookies for that particular page .
The difference between Close ’n forget and Distrust and Stealther is that for the latter two you need to activate the addon before you start the private browsing session , while Close ’n forget allows you to remove the history after you leave the page which is useful if you just happen to stumble upon an objectionable page without intending to and need to delete it from history .
9. HistoryBlock works differently .
It allows you to create a list of sites that you want to be blocked from history .
If you have a couple of sites that you visit regularly then you can use History Block to permanently prevent those sites from getting into the history records no matter when and how many times you visit it .
And do n’t forget to checkout Pornzilla .
... to see first - hand how this story is being covered and reacted to :
The suffering after the Sichuan earthquake was so widespread and horrific , and the impression of rapid , heroic , all - out response was so important to the government , that the episode really had a " 9/11 " - style role in popular imagination .
The Chinese people standing as one to help the victims of Wenchuan and other devastated cities ; premier Wen Jiabao flying directly to the disaster site that very afternoon to oversee recovery efforts ; People 's Liberation Army detachments flooding in from every province to haul rubble out of school yards and pull survivors to safety -- this is what the Chinese public heard , saw , and was reminded of after the earthquake and ever since .
*
The idea that the disaster could somehow have been induced , invited , or worsened by governmental action -- well , no one knows how this idea will be debated or allowed to spread in China , but the consequences could be profound .
This is a placeholder note to say : watch this story carefully .____*
A new chapter in Postcards from Tomorrow Square , called " After the Earthquake , " is about the different ways the disaster affected several villages in Sichuan province .
It is a plot of which Jorge Luis Borges would have been proud : some of the best military and juridical minds in Italy are wrestling with the problem of how to dispose of the unwelcome legacy of tens - perhaps hundreds - of thousands of soldiers who never existed .
Though commanded by a real Lieutenant General , headquartered in Padua , Italy 's so - called Terzo corpo designato d'Armata was a fiction - a giant cold - war bluff .
It was dreamed up in the early 50s to convince Moscow that Nato 's frontline was altogether more solid than was the case .
Successive commanders and their minuscule staffs generated mountains of paperwork to show that any commie troops breaching the Yugoslav border would have to reckon with an entire army corps , up to 300,000 - strong , on the flat Venetian hinterland .
Troops - most of them imaginary - were recruited and promoted , fuel was notionally stored , and ammunition supposedly distributed in perhaps the most elaborate exercise ever in Italian fantasia .
The army was disbanded in 1972 but archives and barracks the length of Italy have remained clogged with what La Stampa said was " tonnes " of paper .
And none of it can be destroyed .
Under Italian law , officially secret documents can only be pulped once they have been declassified .
And they can only be declassified by the office or unit that created them .
And , of course , this no longer exists ...
As the former president Francesco Cossiga remarked , " At times , real life is more like what happens in novels than you might think . "

Another Sanders Betrayal by Laurie Dobson After Impeachment -- What Next for U.S. Politics ? by Wayne Price Trump is Not the Main Problem by Wayne Price Response to a Trotskyist ( ISO ) Criticism of Anarchism north america / mexico | the left | opinion / analysis Thursday March 26 , 2009 12:15 Thursday March 26 , 2009 12:15 by Wayne Price - personal communication by Wayne Price - personal communication drwdprice at aol dot com Anarchism vs. Trotskyism
An ISOer describes why he went from being an anarchist to being a Trotskyist .
He expands on his experiences to make general criticisms of anarchism .
I explain why his views are mistaken .
Recently a prominent member of the International Socialist Organization ( ISO ) of the US published a criticism of anarchism in the ISOs newpaper , the Socialist Worker ( D Amato , 2009 ) .
It was particularly interesting because it was based on his own life experience .
( The ISO is in the wing of Trotskyism which rejects Trotskys theory that the Soviet Union under Stalin remained a  degenerated workers  state .
Instead the ISO regarded the USSR , more - or - less correctly , as state capitalist .
It was affiliated with the International Socialist Tendency , which was controlled by Britains Socialist Workers Party [ no relation to the US group of the same name ] until they split . )
Paul DAmato reminisces , 
As a teenager I found my way to anarchism first .
Anarchism hatred of all authority flowed naturally from my reaction to the way I saw the world around me 
He and his friends went to an anarchist bookstore and bought pamphlets .
He was impressed by the writings of Errico Malatesta , the great Italian anarchist , and quotes a passage from him because of  the way that it explained how capitalism reinforces its rule . 
However ,  A few things made me drift away from anarchism : my own experience , and meeting socialists who did not identify socialism with state tyranny , as the Stalinists had done . 
Today he is managing editor of the ISOs journal , the International Socialist Review , and has written a book , The Meaning of Marxism .
The arc of my own political history has some similarities to , and differences from , that of DAmato .
( See Price 2008 b . )
As a teenager I became an anarchist , of the anarchist - pacifist trend .
However , I became persuaded that a revolution was needed and that anarchist - pacifism could not make a revolution .
I became a Trotskyist of the same trend that DAmato is in now ; I participated in founding the International Socialists , the predecessor organization of the ISO .
Eventually my friends and I decided that the IS was too mushy and reformist , and we split to form the Revolutionary Socialist League .
We sought a revolutionary , and eventually , libertarian , interpretation of Trotskyism .
Finally we rejected Trotskyism altogether and became revolutionary , pro-organization , anarchists .
We dissolved into the Love and Rage Anarchist Federation .
Today I am a member of the US Northeastern Federation of Anarchist - Communists .
With this background , I think I can understand the reasons why someone would come to reject anarchism for Trotskyism , but I have come to disagree with this conclusion .
DAmatos Experiences DAmato tells of the experiences which turned him off to anarchism .
While he was living in Britain , he writes , a socialist group was organizing demonstrations by unemployed workers to demand jobs .
His anarchist friends refused to support this because they believed that fighting for  the right to work was to fight for the right to be exploited .
Instead they advocated dropping out of the system by squatting , taking over abandoned buildings , and by living alternate , bohemian , lifestyles .
He concluded ,  No one should begrudge anyone the lifestyle they chose , but all too often personal revolt becomes a substitute for social and collective struggle for a better world . 
Later he was part of the Clamshell Alliances efforts to shut down the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant in Massachusetts .
He came to dislike the anarchists  use of consensus , instead of majority rule , to run planning meetings .
He felt that consensus led to endless long meetings , acrimony , and de facto minority rule .
To be fair , he admits  I later learned that by no means did all anarchists abstain from struggle for purist reasons , but lifestyle anarchism is a strong strain in the movement , even among activists .
So if many anarchists are not lifestylists ,  and if even many lifestylists  are also , he says , activists ,  then it is hard to see the value of this objection to anarchism .
My revolutionary class struggle anarchism is not opposed to people living nonconformist lives , being vegetarians , riding bicycles , or organizing alternate institutions , including squats or coops .
But I do not regard this approach as a strategy for getting rid of capitalism and the state .
My comrades and I advocate mass struggles by workers and oppressed people , leading ultimately to a workers  revolution .
Nor do we insist on consensus in our meetings ; we use majority rule and democratic procedures .
So DAmatos bad experiences with anarchists in his youth , while real , do not apply to the trend of anarchist - communism which many of us believe in .
Prefiguring a Stateless Society Generalizing from his experiences , DAmato concludes ,  Anarchism makes the error of believing that the means to achieving a classless , stateless society must prefigure the end result .
One does not expect the plow to prefigure the wheat ; nor should we expect our methods of organizing to fight for a better world to prefigure or look exactly like the world we plan to achieve . 
This implies that means and ends have little relation to each other , and that revolutionary socialists should build institutions which do not embody the classless , stateless , goal .
They should build revolutionary institutionse.g. , the democratic - centralist  vanguard party ,  the workers  state / dictatorship of the proletariat which presumably are hard and sharp , like a steel plow .
While revolutionary anarchists do not focus on building coops and squats , we do indeed seek to prefigure the future .
Our goal is a self - managed , radically democratic , society , and our method is to build self - managing , radically democratic , mass movements today .
Our ends and our means are the same .
We do not build centralized parties which seek to take power , but build revolutionary federations of anarchists which encourage workrs to take power for themselves .
Of course , there will have to be compromises .
It is a straw man for DAmato to say that anarchists expect our methods of organizing to look exactly like the world we plan to achieve . 
Not exactly , no .
But as close to it as possible , with as much direct democracy as possible and as little centralization as is minimally necessary at any one time .
As is common among Trotskyists , DAmato cites against us the Friends of Durruti Group from the Spanish Revolution of 1936 - 7 .
The Friends of Durruti disagreed with the main anarchist organizations , which had allied with pro-capitalist parties in the Popular Front , joining the bourgeois - democratic government of the Republic when it was fighting a civil war against the fascists .
Instead they called for a strategy aimed at replacing both the Republican and fascist states with a federation of workers  and peasants  organizations , coordinating armed workers  militias .
He claims that they advocated  tak[ing ] state power ,  creating a non-prefigurative workers  state / proletarian dictatorship , as do the Trotskyists .
As the heirs of the Friends of Durruti Group , we know that is not true .
They advocated the workers taking power , but not taking STATE power , that is , not creating a new state ( Price 2006 ) .
What is the state ?
In a statement which should be authoritative for Marxists , Engels ( 1972 ) described it as an armed power [ a ] special public force .
It consists not merely of armed men but also of material appendages , prisons and coercive institutions of all kinds organs of society standing above society representatives of a power which estranges them from society  ( p.230 ) .
Does this sound like an institution through which the workers and oppressed could rule ?
But it certainly does not prefigure a classless , stateless , society !
After all previous revolutions , a minority continued to rule and exploit the majority .
Therefore the ruling class needed a state , to hold down the majority .
But after a socialist ( anarchist ) revolution , the ruling class will be the workers , in alliance with all the oppressed , that is the big majority holding down the minority of capitalists and their hangers on , for a period .
This does not require a socially - alienated bureaucratic - police machine such as the state .
It does require the self - organized , self - managed , working class , with its ( prefigurative ) democratic mass institutions and armed population .
Implications
To some it may seem as if I am quibbling .
After all , the ISO says that it is for democratic movements , advocates a workers  state  which is controlled by the workers , seeks to build a revolutionary party which is democratic centralist ( centralist but democratic ) , and opposes the belief of the orthodox Trotskyists that the Soviet Union was really some kind of workers  state .
It is these apparently libertarian - democratic aspects of this variety of Trotskyism which makes it possible for some activists , antagonized by various weaknesses in contemporary anarchism , to become Trotskyists of the ISO type ( I am speaking from experience ) .
In fact , it does not take much experiece with the ISO to find out how undemocratic its internal life is or how manipulative it is in its organizing .
The ISO broke from its international organization , when its British co-thinkers started giving the ISO arbitrary and bossy orders , without democratic discussion .
For several presidential elections the ISO opportunistically campaigned for Ralph Nader , despite his support for capitalism and the state .
Apparently they thought that supporting a bourgeois politician who wants to run the bourgeois state and bourgeois economy was consistent with revolutionary socialism ( after all , they did not have to prefigure the future society here and now ) .
When asked how they justify this , one ISOer told me ,  It builds the organization . 
Similarly they have supported voting for Hugo Chavez in Venezuela , although Chavez is running a bourgeois state and a bourgeois economy , despite his talk of socialism .
With Nader and Chavez , the ISO made exactly the same mistake , the same crime against the working class , as did the leading Spanish anarchists of the 30s .
The ISO denounces them ( correctly ) for joining the Spanish Popular Front with pro-capitalist parties and being willing to support a capitalist government .
But how are the ISOs politics any different ?
While ISOers claim to be for a radically - democratic workers  state ,  they believe that Lenin and Trotsky ran a workers  state when they established a one - party police state after the Russian civil war .
In fact , they believe that the Soviet Union continued to be a workers  state under Stalin up until 1929 when he began a major industrialization drive ( Cliff 1970 ; Price 2008a ) .
Therefore they believe that there can be a so - called workers  state , a rule of the working class , even after the workers have lost all political power for years .
Someone else , such as the party , can stand - in for the working class .
This is not qualitatively better than the views of the orthodox ( Soviet defensist  ) Trotskyists .
( Most members of the ISO may not know about this aspect of its theory of the state , or have not thought through the implications , but the leaders , such as DAmato , have . )
Since the ISO believes that the workers  state does not have to be prefigurative ( it can be like a sharp metal plow ) , and since a workers  state can exist without any control by the workers ( as under Lenin and the early reign of Stalin ) , then it would seem dangerous to ever let the ISO get near state power .
Although their practice in such areas as the Nader campaign makes them more likely to be like wishy - washy , defeated , social democrats than state - power - seizing state - capitalists !
It is a pity that DAmato never found his way back to anarchism , in a revolutionary version .

What I believe and how I came to believe it .
Written for www.Anarkismo.net DAmato tells of the experiences which turned him off to anarchism .
While he was living in Britain , he writes , a socialist group was organizing demonstrations by unemployed workers to demand jobs .
His anarchist friends refused to support this because they believed that fighting for  the right to work was to fight for the right to be exploited .
Instead they advocated dropping out of the system by squatting , taking over abandoned buildings , and by living alternate , bohemian , lifestyles .
He concluded ,  No one should begrudge anyone the lifestyle they chose , but all too often personal revolt becomes a substitute for social and collective struggle for a better world .
Later he was part of the Clamshell Alliances efforts to shut down the Seabrook Nuclear Power Plant in Massachusetts .
He came to dislike the anarchists  use of consensus , instead of majority rule , to run planning meetings .
He felt that consensus led to endless long meetings , acrimony , and de facto minority rule .
To be fair , he admits  I later learned that by no means did all anarchists abstain from struggle for purist reasons , but lifestyle anarchism is a strong strain in the movement , even among activists .
So if many anarchists are not lifestylists ,  and if even many lifestylists  are also , he says , activists ,  then it is hard to see the value of this objection to anarchism .
My revolutionary class struggle anarchism is not opposed to people living nonconformist lives , being vegetarians , riding bicycles , or organizing alternate institutions , including squats or coops .
But I do not regard this approach as a strategy for getting rid of capitalism and the state .
My comrades and I advocate mass struggles by workers and oppressed people , leading ultimately to a workers  revolution .
Nor do we insist on consensus in our meetings ; we use majority rule and democratic procedures .
So DAmatos bad experiences with anarchists in his youth , while real , do not apply to the trend of anarchist - communism which many of us believe in .

We were already fairly impressed last April , when we heard ( via ABC ) that one Sheyla Hershey traveled to Houston for a boob job .
And not just any boob job :
An enhancement bound for the record books .
Because after eight surgeries and a full gallon of silicone , the petite model / actress was a staggering 34 FFF .
Still , Hershey wanted more !
And she was determined to get it .
When her boyfriend begged her to stop , she broke up with him ( note to men :
You have to support our dreams , no matter how deluded and life - threatening silly they might seem ! ) .
But Hershey was forced to settle with her FFF mosquito bites because " the state of Texas has limits on the amount of silicone that can be injected into breast implants , " noted ABC .
Reading this , we found ourselves impressed by Texas , because we did n't think it was the kind of state to impose limits on such things , what with the Dallas Cowboys cheerleaders and the state priding itself on everything being bigger there and whatnot .
But , as Hershey discovered through diligent research , they have no such restraint in Brazil !
And so now , after a ninth surgery , she 's the proud owner of both a 38 KKK bust ( according to Britain 's Daily Star ) and the world record for largest breasts .
We wonder if Guinness has a category for worst back pain .
The people of Villanueva said they ’d had enough .
Men in cowboy hats , women with hand - scrawled signs , children on bikes -- they gathered outside town and blocked the main interstate highway .
“ If you ca n’t do it , quit ! ” they told their police force .
They demanded that the army take over .
The army rolled into this town in Zacatecas state last month and ordered the police to stand down and surrender their weapons .
They did .
Things only got worse .
A few days later , Police Chief Romulo Madrid , a former military man said to be eager to cooperate with the army , was shot and killed outside his house at 10:30 on a bright morning .
The mayor ’s chauffeur , a first cousin , was arrested in the shooting .
Five days later , gunmen working for a drug gang ambushed an army patrol .
One soldier and four assailants were killed .
Among the attackers captured was a police officer .
Sources close to the military point to evidence that elements of the police force set up the army patrol .
For Mexicans to call on the armed forces , whose human rights record has been dubious at best , testifies to the firm conviction that the state and its civilian authorities , including the police , no longer protect them from the gang warfare of narcotics traffickers .
Shootings , kidnappings , extortion and threats have shattered the relative peace of Zacatecas , a central mountainous state that sends a greater proportion of its people as migrants to the United States than almost any other .
The unrest has disrupted immigration patterns , brought the local economy to its knees , destroyed small - town life and now threatens the upcoming planting season in an area that relies heavily on agriculture .
“ They are impotent , ” Lorenzo Marquez , a merchant , said of the authorities .
From the market stall where he sells cheese , sausage and jalapeno peppers , he has watched too many incidents of thugs hauling people away at gunpoint in broad daylight .
“ And we the people are even more impotent . ”
‘ Criminal groups ’
Carlos Pinto , the powerful interior minister for Zacatecas , acknowledged that “ criminal groups , every day more violent , are challenging the state . ”
“ Our institutions are not proportionate to the needs , ” he said .
“ This problem grabbed us without our police being ready or properly equipped . ”
Rodolfo Garcia Zamora , a researcher at the Autonomous University of Zacatecas , says that immigration may increase from the state , and that citizens left here could take the law into their own hands .
“ The threat is of social and political decomposition in Zacatecas , and in the nation , in which the authorities remain subordinated and violence is the norm , ” he said .
“ The situation has overtaken the government and its institutions . ”
Zacatecas has long been a corridor for smuggling routes from central Mexico northward , with the trafficking gangs from the Pacific state of Sinaloa in control of most activity .
Then , several years ago , violence surged as members of the so - called Gulf cartel and their hired guns , the Zetas , began moving in to challenge their Sinaloa rivals .
Criminal opportunists move in as well , taking advantage of the fear and collapse of law and order .
The last straw
For the people of Villanueva , the last straw was the kidnapping last month of Roberto Garcia Cardenas , a retired professor in his 60s nicknamed El Pollero , the Chicken Man , for his part - time job selling chickens in the market .
Garcia was also a money lender , a business that won him many properties , and many enemies .
Garcia ’s family was able to raise the 600,000 pesos ( about $ 40,000 ) his kidnappers demanded .
But when his children arrived to pay the ransom , the kidnappers seized them : a 24 - year - old daughter who had given birth just a few weeks earlier , and a half - blind 17 - year - old son .
They sent Garcia out to gather a new ransom , this time more than 3 million pesos ( about $ 200,000 ) .
“ They threatened me and beat me , ” Garcia said of his kidnappers .
Garcia desperately drove through the streets of Villanueva , with megaphones on the roof of his car , offering to forgive the high interest he was charging if borrowers would pay the principal they owed .
He tried to hawk some of his properties .
Eventually the children were freed in an operation that remains mysterious .
The family , like most that have endured a similar ordeal , fled Zacatecas .
The Garcia story was only the most chilling in a long string of kidnappings .
State prosecutor Ambrosio Romero said he registered 30 cases last year and six in January but acknowledged that far more cases are not reported .
The perpetrators obtain information on their victims by surfing the Internet and often contact families in the U.S. to wire the ransom money .
In some cases , kidnappers showed up with a public notary so the victim could sign over deeds to his properties .
Place of migration
For the last century or so , Zacatecas has sent tens of thousands of migrants to the United States to work , legally and illegally .
They in turn send money back ( about 10 % of the state ’s GDP last year ) , and many eventually return to set up businesses , build homes ( one story each year ) and deal in property .
Many ultimately retire in Zacatecas .
All of that is changing .
For - sale signs are popping up everywhere ; businesses such as restaurants , clothing stores and mechanic workshops are being shuttered .
Many Zacatecas residents who live abroad have stopped returning .
The horse tracks and dance halls that returning migrants favored have been abandoned .
A public notary said her work validating business and property sales has fallen 80 % .
Antonio de la Torre del Rio , the mayor of Villanueva , says the construction company he owns , which was selling more than 150 tons of poured concrete a week , now does n’t sell that much in a month .
According to one academic study , 75 % of the towns in Zacatecas are shrinking in population .
Villanueva , with 32,000 people , was famous for musicians who congregate in the central plaza to be hired , mostly by returning migrants .
But now the musicians -- norteños with their trumpets , black - suited mariachis , and the native - son tamboreros with their huge drums -- all stand around , idle and largely silent .
Jose Guardado slumped in a corner of Villanueva ’s leafy town square , his drum doubling as a billboard for his business .
Guardado regrets his decision to move back to Villanueva after living in Washington state for 15 years ; his brother Emiterio is already making plans to return to Chicago .
“ People are n’t coming , ” he said .
“ They ’re afraid of getting kidnapped , robbed , killed .
The police are no help .
The police and the bad guys , they ’re the same band . ”
Patronage vehicles
Mistrust of the police runs deep here and throughout Mexico .
Local forces are seen as corrupt and infiltrated by drug gangs .
But they also are traditional vehicles for patronage , and small - town mayors and state governors are usually loath to lose control of them .
Villanueva Mayor
De la Torre initially accepted his people ’s clamor to hand security tasks over to the army .
But he quickly changed his mind .
He asked for his police to be reinstated , even though almost every member of the police force had flunked a test , administered by the army , to rate their qualifications and honesty .
De la Torre also defended his chauffeur and first cousin , arrested in the shooting of Madrid , the police chief .
Madrid was gunned down Feb. 2 as he stepped from his home .
The chauffeur , Antonio de la Torre Quiroz , was arrested as a material witness and remains under investigation .
Two senior government sources close to the case said they believed the man served as a lure to get Madrid out of the house .
The sources spoke on condition of anonymity because details of the investigation are not public .
Mayor
De la Torre acknowledged that violence and fear have reached unprecedented levels .
“ Someone is kidnapped , and everyone says , ‘ Who ’s next ? ’ ” he said .
“ We ca n’t continue this way .
The town is dying . ”
If citizens do n’t trust the police , neither , it appears , does the military .
An army patrol was ambushed Feb. 7 in the Zacatecas town of Fresnillo by drug - gang gunmen who attacked the soldiers from at least two flanks , killing a sergeant and leaving a colonel badly wounded .
Among the attackers killed was a senior regional commander of the Zetas , and among those captured was a police officer .
Sources close to the military say that two police units meant to accompany the army patrol inexplicably missed a final turnoff along the route and were not present when the gunfire erupted .

The body that advises the government on illegal drugs has recommended ecstasy be downgraded to a Class B drug .
Ecstasy is currently grouped with heroin , cocaine , crack and LSD in Class A. Suppliers of such drugs can face a life sentence in prison .
But the Home Office has rejected the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ' recommendation .
The council 's head , Prof David Nutt , accused ministers of being swayed by " politics " and not scientific evidence .
He said : " Our job is not to give messages to the public .
Our job is to tell the home secretary and drugs minister about the relative harms of drugs .
" I think they have accepted our evidence but I think they have made a political decision . "
A row broke out earlier this month after Prof Nutt likened the dangers of ecstasy use and horse - riding .
Home Secretary Jacqui Smith responded by accusing him of trivialising the dangers of the drug .
He later apologised for any offence and said the views were not those of his colleagues on the council .
Latest evidence
The advisory council reviewed the latest evidence on ecstasy last year and held a secret ballot of its 31 members on the issue of re-classification .
It is understood the result was not unanimous , but a majority voted to recommend moving the drug to Class B. DRUGS - RELATED DEATHS 2007 Deaths mentioned on death certificates where cause is listed as drug poisoning Cocaine and crack cocaine are indistinguishable in the body after death so no separate figures
The total number of deaths , which includes anti-depressants and painkillers , is 3,095 The advisers ' view is that ecstasy is not as harmful as other Class A drugs and causes far fewer deaths .
It says ecstasy use has no significant impact on short - term memory loss and finds little evidence to link ecstasy to criminal behaviour .
But it will call for further research into the effects of taking ecstasy , particularly on younger users .
The council is made up of medical and pharmaceutical experts , as well as people with experience of social problems caused by drugs , including police and lawyers .
Its role is to keep classification under review and advise ministers on any measures it thinks should be taken about drugs misuse .
Martin Barnes , chief executive of the think tank DrugScope , who sits on the advisory council , said it was crucial that a rigorously independent body was entrusted with this type of research precisely because drug classification was politically charged .
He did not dismiss the dangers of ecstasy , but said the job of the council was to dispassionately look at the relative harm of ecstasy compared with other drugs , such as cocaine , crack or heroin .
The council 's report found that over the past 10 years , deaths in which ecstasy was implicated averaged between 33 and 50 per year , while deaths where it was considered the sole drug responsible averaged between 10 to 17 per year .
But the Police Superintendents ' Association of England and Wales has expressed opposition to suggestions that ecstasy should be downgraded to a Class B drug .
FROM THE TODAY PROGRAMME Please turn on JavaScript .

More from Today programme Ian Johnston , president of the association , told the BBC : " This is not some academic or scientific exercise , this is dealing with people 's lives . "
Mr Barnes said that when no other drug was involved , ecstasy accounted for between 10 and 17 deaths a year .
Last month , the Home Office restored cannabis from Class C to Class B , against the wishes of the advisory council .
BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said this latest recommendation raised real doubts about how long the council could continue in its present form if its experts continued to be ignored .
' E every weekend '
Dr Evan Harris , science spokesman for the Liberal Democrats , argued that Prof Nutt was engaging in " rational debate " when he compared the dangers of taking ecstasy and those of horse - riding .
Speaking to GMTV , Dr Harris said : " The problem with putting ecstasy in Class A ... is that if thousands of young people take 'e ' every weekend , and they see that it is in the same class as heroin and cocaine and crack cocaine , then it is hard to argue that those are particularly more dangerous than ecstasy . "
ECSTASY : THE FACTS
Most common club drug Comes as pills and as a powder Active ingredient is a drug called MDMA Home Office surveys show 4.8 % of UK 10 - 25 year olds have tried it at least once and 9 % of 18 - 25 year olds have .
( Offending , Crime & Justice Survey 2004 ) Linked to 58 deaths in 2007 Ecstasy is an illegal class A drug Maximum penalty for possession is 14 years in prison .
For supply , life in prison .
You can get an unlimited fine for both Source : Kate Roach , BBC Surgery
The row erupted following the publication of an article by Prof Nutt in the Journal of Psychopharmacology .
In it , he wrote : " Drug harm can be equal to harms in other parts of life .
There is not much difference between horse - riding and ecstasy . "
He said horse - riding accounted for about 10 deaths a year , and went on : " This attitude raises the critical question of why society tolerates - indeed encourages - certain forms of potentially harmful behaviour but not others such as drug use . "
Jacqui Smith said she was " surprised " and " disappointed " by his comments and told him he had gone beyond his role as head of the advisory council .
The professor later said in a statement : " I am sorry to those who may have been offended by my article .
" I would like to assure those who have read my article that I had no intention of trivialising the dangers of ecstasy . "
Fatalities from ecstasy are caused by massive organ failure from overheating or the effects of drinking too much water .

OK – Joaquin Phoenix is going to become a rapper .
Wait , because it gets worse .
Joaquin Phoenix is going to become a rapper and Casey Affleck is making a documentary about it .
Wait , though , because it gets worse .
The reason why Casey Affleck is directing a documentary about Joaquin Phoenix becoming a rapper is because Diddy has decided to teach him how to rap .
We dare you to think of a worse idea than that .
You ’ve got all day .
It would be wrong of us to admit to a small amount of grudging respect for Joaquin Phoenix .
That ’s because you ca n’t define our feelings for Joaquin Phoenix with a paltry word like ‘ respect ’ .
It ’s more like the kind of gaping , slack - jawed fascination that you ’d usually reserve for a fire - eater or a dog on a trampoline .
The man ’s a genius .
Joaquin Phoenix is a genius .
He ’s obviously sat down at some point and “ OK , how can I top interrupting an interview to sincerely ask if I ’ve got frogs in my hair ? ” before deciding “ I know , I ’ll retire from acting forever even though it ’s probably the only thing I ’m any good at . ”
But then Joaquin Phoenix decided that even that did n’t reach the amazing heights he ’d set for himself , so he set aside time for an angry , incoherent , prematurely - axed interview to announce his retirement .
And yet , despite that video being the greatest thing we ’ve ever watched , Joaquin Phoenix still thought he could do better .
So he has .
It ’s been announced that Casey Affleck is making a documentary following Joaquin Phoenix ’s transition from acting to music .
To rap music .
To rap music under the tutelage of arch bellend Diddy .
Unless someone is playing a very cruel prank on us , this is all true .
IGN reports :
Phoenix famously announced his intention to trade acting for music last spring , and while many thought it was a joke , it now appears he was deadly serious , with Phoenix working on an album under the guidance of rap legend Sean ‘ Puffy ’ Combs .
Long - time friend Casey Affleck will make a documentary about his efforts .
and according to The Hollywood Reporter , principal photography will commence … tonight .
It ’s not just us , is it ?
None of this makes any sense to you either , right ?
Joaquin Phoenix is becoming a rapper , Diddy ’s helping him and Ben Affleck ‘s little brother is making a film about it because it ’s so important .
We think we need to lie down .
We ’ve thought long and hard about this – perhaps longer and harder than anyone healthy person probably should – and there ’s only one conclusion we can reach .
Still stung by not winning an Oscar for Walk The Line , Joaquin Phoenix has watched how readily Mickey Rourke has been welcomed back by Hollywood after spending years pursuing a cack - headed career as a professional boxer , and so he ’s decided to follow suit .
Only Joaquin ’s not much of a fighter and the only thing as ridiculous as boxing is becoming a professional rapper .
That has to be it , does n’t it ?
It has to be .
Still , what with Russell Crowe ‘s continued ill - advised foray into music and now Joaquin Phoenix ’s hip - hop career getting off the ground , it ’s becoming clear that the movie Gladiator was the place to be to see a number of woeful Hollywood vanity projects take shape .
With this in mind , we eagerly await Sir Derek Jacobi ‘s debut single – rumoured to be a cover of Murder Ya Bloodclart by Vital Elements .

Thoughts on Exile
For a late night summer party , we wanted to deploy an array of maybe 20 or so little LED garden lights along the periphery of our back yard .
And since it was for a one - time event , there was n’t much sense in buying ( or building ) a set of nice looking permanent solar lights .
So here is an alternative : make your own ultra- low cost temporary garden lights using LEDs , lithium coin cells , and mason jars .
To start with , we need LEDs and CR2032 lithium coin cells .
One each per jar .
The best kind of LED for this design is an ultrabright LED with a diffused lens so that the light cast by the LED chip goes in * every direction , * not just in the direction that the LED points ( which is what you get with LEDs that have clear lenses ) .
Having easy access , we opted for the 10 mm diffused white LEDs from here , but you can get similar LEDs elsewhere as well .
For batteries , a very good option is Digi - Key .
You * may * be able to do better from various eBay sellers and so forth , but we ’ve gotten burned ( figuratively , not literally ) by bad sets of lithium coin cells , so beware !
One thing to keep in mind : there are strict restrictions on shipping lithium coin cells by air , so if at all possible , allow time for ground shipment of batteries .
( And , if you have leftover coin cells , you can always use them to make BristleBots ! )
Next , you ’ll need some jars .
Mason jars are available by the dozen in your local supermarket , in the canning / pickling section ( which seems to actually still exist ! ) , but are also available online of course .
The “ other ” way is to start with a set of recycled jars , of course .
If you eat a lot of pasta sauce from jars , you can build up a collection pretty quickly .
And even if you do n’t eat food that comes in jars , you can usually find good jars at thrift stores – so you really do n’t need to spend a lot on this .
But even if you ’re buying brand new jars , you should be able to get all of your parts for a grand total of about $ 1 - $ 1.50 per light jar .
( If you want to get a bit fancier , there is also plenty of room for that .
I like this set of instructions for making frosted glass jars for LEDs – those would work well for this project too . )
Now we hook up the LED to the battery as though we were making LED Throwies . *
Connect an LED directly across the terminals of the lithium coin cell .
The long lead goes to the ‘+’ side of the battery .
Wrap it once with tape– just about any kind– to keep the LED leads touching the battery cell .
( We had blue masking tape handy so we used that – it seemed to work just fine . )
* Important safety tip : do not throw the completed LED jar lights .
Now the tricky step :
Bend the LED 90 degrees from the battery cell using a half - twist , so that ( 1 ) it can bend that that way and ( 2 ) you do n’t touch the two leads of the LED to each other .
Place the LED assembly inside one of your jar lids and tape it down in place .
( Optionally , you can do a better job of centering the LED than shown here ! )
Finally , screw the jar onto the lid , and it ’s done .
With a little practice , you can make a few of these per minute .
And , after dark , they start to come alive .
We think that these could be potentially interesting for a number of different types of outdoor events – making quick cheap lighting when and where it ’s needed .
They are relatively scaleable , in the sense that hundreds of them are much more affordable than regular solar garden lights .
The difference is that like traditional luminarias , these jar lights are temporary .
However unlike luminarias , LED jar lights are waterproof , wo n’t blow out or catch on fire , and will stay safely lit– unattended – for several days up to a week .
And , if you do n’t need them for a week at a time , you can always easily disassemble them and save the batteries for next time .
Alphabetical Index of Card Games
Traditional multi-player card games for which rules are available from this site are listed below in alphabetical order , together with the number of players and the design and number of cards or tiles needed for each - see further explanation at the end of the page .
If you are searching for games for a particular number of players you may prefer to use the Index of Games by Number of Players .
Please note :
There are separate pages for : Commercial games ( games requiring a special pack of cards produced by a single manufacturer )
Solitaire / Patience games ( games for one player )
Invented games ( newly created games and variations contributed by readers )
These types of game are generally not listed in the index below .
Building this site is a long project .
At present the site contains rules for only a minority of the card games that exist .
Therefore it is quite likely that the game you want is not yet here .
If you already know the game you might consider contributing a description of it to this site .
If not , you could try looking it up in a book .
Index of Games
Explanation of symbols
Players
The recommended number of players for each game is given in bold .
Other numbers for which the game is possible but may be less satisfactory are give in lighter type .
For example " 2 , 3 –7 , 8 , 9 " means best for 3 to 7 players ; possible for 2 , 8 or 9 .
Design
This column indicates the type of cards or tiles needed .
See the equipment section of the classified index for further details of the different designs .
Quantity
This column gives the number of cards in the deck , indicates where multiple decks are used , and the number of jokers .
Where the game can be played with various sizes or numbers of decks , perhaps depending on the number of players , the possibilities are listed , separated by commas .
For example , " 2x32 " means a double 32 - card deck : 64 cards in all with two copies of each card .
" 52+2J " means a 52 - card deck with two jokers .
" 32 , 36 " means the game can be played with 32 or 36 cards .
" 2x52+2J , 3x52+3J " means that the game can be played with two 52 - card decks plus two jokers ( 106 cards ) or three 52 - card decks plus three 52 - card decks plus three jokers ( 159 cards ) .
2.2 Million Australian Homes to Get Free Insulation
February 5th , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
Insulation may not be as sexy as solar panels or wind turbines , but it ’s an important tool in reducing our dependence on fossil fuels .
The Australian Government is stepping up its commitment to the environment by installing ceiling insulation in 2.2 million homes — for free .
The Government will also increase the rebates for solar water heating from AUD $ 1000 to AUD $ 1600 .
Australia ’s initiative will reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 49.4 million tons — the equivalent of taking over one million cars off the road every year .
In addition to providing long - term environmental benefits , the plan will also give the economy a much - needed boost .
The Australian Government is spending billions of dollars over the next two years in an attempt to strengthen its economy .

Inconsistent Maximum Likelihood Estimation : An “ Ordinary ” Example
2008-08-09 at 6:24 pm
The widespread use of the Maximum Likelihood Estimate ( MLE ) is partly based on an intuition that the value of the model parameter that best explains the observed data must be the best estimate , and partly on the fact that for a wide class of models the MLE has good asymptotic properties .
These properties include “ consistency ” — that as the amount of data increases , the estimate will , with higher and higher probability , become closer and closer to the true value — and , moreover , that the MLE converges as quickly to this true value as any other estimator .
These asymptotic properties might be seen as validating the intuition that the MLE must be good , except that these good properties of the MLE do not hold for some models .
This is well known , but the common examples where the MLE is inconsistent are n’t too satisfying .
Some involve models where the number of parameters increases with the number of data points , which I think is cheating , since these ought to be seen as “ latent variables ” , not parameters .
Others involve singular probability densities , or cases where the MLE is at infinity or at the boundary of the parameter space .
Normal ( Gaussian ) mixture models fall in this category — the likelihood becomes infinite as the variance of one of the mixture components goes to zero , while the mean is set to one of the data points .
One might think that such examples are “ pathological ” , and do not really invalidate the intuition behind the MLE .
Here , I ’ll present a simple “ ordinary ” model where the MLE is inconsistent .
The probability density defined by this model is free of singularities ( or any other pathologies ) , for any value of the parameter .
The MLE is always well defined ( apart from ties , which occur with probability zero ) , and the MLE is always in the interior of the parameter space .
Moreover , the problem is one - dimensional , allowing easy visualization .
The data consists of i.i.d. real values x 1 , x 2 , … , x n .
The model has one positive real parameter , t . The distribution of a data point is an equal mixture of the standard normal and a normal distribution with mean t and standard deviation exp ( - 1/t^2 ) :
Using this R program , I produced some plots of densities and likelihood functions derived from this model .
Looking at the top left plot , the probability density function when t=2.5 , you can see two modes near 0 and t .
As t decreases to 0.6 , and then 0.2 , the mode at t moves left and gets narrower .
A narrower mode has higher probability density at its peak .
When t=0.2 , the peak density of the mode at t is about 1010 times higher than the peak density of the mode at 0 , which is invisible at the scale of the plot ( the scale is noted in the left - side caption ) .
The bottom plots are of likelihood functions given data generated from the model with t=0.6 .
I generated 100 points , and used the first 10 , the first 30 , and all 100 for the three plots .
With 10 data points , the value that maximizes the likelihood ( 0.5916 ) is close to the true parameter value ( 0.6 ) .
But as the number of data points increases , the MLE moves away from the true value , getting closer and closer to zero .
The value of the likelihood at the MLE also gets bigger , reaching about 0.3×10162 when 100 data points are used .
This plot shows the likelihood function with 30 data points with the vertical scale changed to show detail other than the peak .
A local maximum of the likelihood around the true value of 0.6 can now be seen .
It is completely dominated by the maximum at 0.0743 , which is about a factor of 1052 higher .
Why does this happen ?
First , note that regardless of the true value of t , the density in the vicinity of zero will be non-singular , so the probability that a data point will land in the interval ( 0 , c ) will be proportional to c when c is small .
In a data set of n points , we can therefore expect the smallest positive data point , call it x 0 , to have a magnitude of about k/n , for some constant k .
Now , consider the value of the log likelihood function at t=x 0 versus its value at the true value of t .
When t=x 0 , the log probability density for x 0 will be approximately
In comparison , the density of x 0 when t is not close to x 0 will be approximately half its density under the N ( 0,1 ) distribution , which will approach a constant as n increases ( and x 0 goes to zero ) .
The density under t=x 0 for data points other than x 0 will approach a constant as n increases and t goes to zero .
On average , the true value of t ( or values near the true value ) will produce a higher value for the density of such points , but the difference in log densities will approach a constant .
The end result is that the contribution to the log likelihood of data points other than x 0 will be greater for the true value of t than for t=x 0 by an amount that grows in proportion to n , while the contribution to the log likelihood of the point x 0 will be greater for t=x 0 than for the true value of t by an amount that grows in proportion to n2 .
As n increases , the n2 contribution will dominate , so the MLE will be close to zero rather than being close to the true value of the parameter .
( Note , however , that the MLE will usually not be exactly equal to x 0 , though when n is large it will usually be nearby .
The argument above just shows that a value of t near x 0 will have higher likelihood than a value near the true value of t. )
So what does this say about the Maximum Likelihood intuition — that the best estimate is the parameter value that best explains the data ?
It illustrates the Bayesian critique of this intuition , which is that using the MLE ignores the volume of the parameter space where the data is fit well .
When n is large , only a tiny region around x 0 fits the data better than the true value of the parameter .
In a posterior distribution ( based on some prior ) , the smallness of this region will cancel the large height of the peak , with the result that the posterior probability that t is near x 0 will usually not be large .

Any serious treatment of the renewal of socialism today must begin with capitalism ’s creative destruction of the bases of all social existence .
Since the late 1980s , the world has been engulfed in an epoch of catastrophe capitalism , manifested today in the convergence of ( 1 ) the planetary ecological crisis , ( 2 ) the global epidemiological crisis , and ( 3 ) the unending world economic crisis .
Added to this are the main features of today ’s “ empire of chaos , ” including the extreme system of imperialist exploitation unleashed by global commodity chains ; the demise of the relatively stable liberal - democratic state with the rise of neoliberalism and neofascism ; and the emergence of a new age of global hegemonic instability accompanied by increased dangers of unlimited war .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Good , but not enough , the Rev. Al Sharpton said in response to New York Post Chairman Rupert Murdoch 's apology for a controversial editorial cartoon published in the newspaper .
Online Wednesday , some Post readers reacted similarly .
Rev. Al Sharpton , center , leads protests against the New York Post cartoon on February 19 in New York City .
Sharpton has lead a chorus of criticism and allegations that the cartoon published Feb. 18 was racist .
He said Murdoch 's apology was a " good gesture , " but he still had questions .
Public debate on the issue continued to rage on the New York Post Web site early Wednesday , with some saying they were offended enough to cancel their subscriptions .
Others defended the cartoon , calling it harmless and calling critics of it oversensitive .
Murdoch's " apology leaves a lot more questions than it gives answers , " Sharpton said Tuesday .
" The question is what will guarantee that these kinds of things will not happen again .
Let us make no mistake about it :
We have seen two apologies in one week -- really one and a half apologies -- which is unprecedented , but clearly not far enough . "
The cartoon by Sean Delonas referenced the mauling of a Connecticut woman by a chimpanzee who was later shot and killed by police .
In its caption , one of the officers says , " They 'll have to find someone else to write the next stimulus bill . "
The cartoon was published the day after President Obama signed the stimulus bill .
Watch CNN 's Lou Dobbs talk with Sharpton »
The Post issued a statement the following day , apologizing but noting that the cartoon was meant to mock what it called an " ineptly written " stimulus bill .
Many critics said the cartoon played on historically racist images by appearing to compare Obama , the nation 's first black president , to the chimpanzee .
Murdoch apologized Tuesday .
" Today I want to personally apologize to any reader who felt offended , and even insulted , " according to the statement from Murdoch , who is also chairman and CEO of News Corporation , which owns the paper .
" I can assure you -- without a doubt -- that the only intent of that cartoon was to mock a badly written piece of legislation .
" It was not meant to be racist , but unfortunately , it was interpreted by many as such .
We all hold the readers of the New York Post in high regard , and I promise you that we will seek to be more attuned to the sensitivities of our community . "
Leaders of the NAACP on Saturday called for the firing of Delonas .
Delonas called the controversy " absolutely friggin ' ridiculous . "
" Do you really think I 'm saying Obama should be shot ?
I did n't see that in the cartoon , " Delonas told CNN .
iReport.com : Should Murdoch , N.Y .
Post do more ?
" It 's about the economic stimulus bill , " he added .
" If you 're going to make that about anybody , it would be ( House Speaker Nancy ) Pelosi , which it 's not . "

Most guys know about the nice guy paradox .
It ’s where they ’ve been told since they were young — both by women and by society in general — that women like “ nice ” guys .
And because they ’ve been told this over and over , most guys grow up trying this approach only to have reality kick them in the groin .
This bothers guys .
A lot .
Why would women claim to want someone who will treat them nice , but then repeatedly turn down or mistreat those that give them exactly what they claim to want ?
Well , I have the answer , and like most major truisms it ’s pretty simple :
Women like when guys are nice to them , but only when they do n’t have to be .
Think about that .
Most guys exclusively using the “ nice ” approach are doormats , and many are so because that ’s all they can be .
They lack the attributes to attract a woman based on pure gravity ( physical size / strength / prowess , ambition , sexuality , intelligence , money , etc. ) .
As a result , these guys are essentially forced to grovel in order to attract a mate , which is patently unattractive .
Quite simply , women like powerful men to be nice to them , not feminized pseudo - men .
A weak man being nice to a woman is essentially an act of submission , like a beggar bowing his head and calling you sir .
Sure , they were respectful to you , but they just asked you for money so it ’s not as meaningful as if it came from a peer or superior .
To get the true benefit of “ nice ” in the way that women enjoy , one has to be able to attract that same woman without being nice , i.e. by the sheer force of character .
Only once that foundation of primal respect is in place can the higher - order offerings such as kindness be appreciated .
It ’s counter - intuitive and it ’s unpleasant , but we ’re dealing with nature here .
Do n’t fight the rules .
To do so is as pointless as picketing gravity or boycotting inertia .

happy new year !
Hi everybody , i am working on the project to bring tail calls to Hotspot .
A prototype was implemented on x86 - 32 and will hopefully be soon availabe on the mlvm site .
The modified hotspot supports tail calls in the interpreter , client and server compiler .
To mark a call as tail call the programmer emits a ' wide ' byte code before the various invoke ... instructions .
The verifier checks that the call really is a tail call ( i.e the last thing the method does before it returns etc. ) .
Hotspot guarantees that a series of such tail calls execute in bounded stack space .
That is no stackoverflow exception happens .
The vm implements most tail calls by removing the calling stack frame .
Some stack frames can not be removed because of java 's access security mechanism .
Every stack frame points to a protection domain via which permissions can be computed .
On access to a guarded resource permissions are computed by intersecting all protection domains that are on the stack .
If caller and callee protection domain are different we can not remove the caller 's stack frame ( or we would have to look whether an ancestor frame already has the same pd on every call - not very efficient ) .
In such a case the tail call proceeds like a normal function call i.e leaving a stack frame .
If a series of tail calls with different pds happen the stack grows .
Eventually if the recursion is deep enough a stack overflow would happen .
The implementation catches this situation and compresses the stack by removing stack frames that have the same protection domain .
The prototype is mostly finished .
I am currently writing my thesis describing the changes and hope to be finished mid february .
By then i hope to have cleaned up the code and will probably post it here on the mail list .

The original Oregon Trail computer game .
( Photo credit : The_Pug_Father via Flickr )
Updated 1:58 p.m. : Oregon Trail will be available for download on the App Store on February 28 , a Gameloft spokesperson said in an e-mail .
Get your immune system ready .
Digital dysentery will be on the rise soon .
Oregon Trail , the computer game that practically raised a generation of American youth thanks to its availability in grade - school computer labs , appears to be making a return on the iPhone .
Video game website IGN today posted a handful of screen shots of the game -- and little else .
No info .
No release date .
Nothing .
The graphics appear very similar to developer Gameloft 's other mobile versions of the game ( the company has n't responded to our request for more details ) .
The new Oregon Trail has a cartoonish look , which should lighten the all - too - common situations in which your wagon loses a wheel and your mates are infected with cholera .
If you have n't heard of Oregon Trail , you probably were n't attending a public school in the late ' 80s or the '90s .
The " edutainment " software had players name a group of nomads to travel on the Oregon Trail in hopes of finding salvation -- as well as learning a bit of history and geography in the process .
The nostalgia - inducing game has spurred a number of homages , including a Lolcat and a number of T - shirts .
No word on when the game will be available in the App Store , but the fact that it's in the works should build excitement among many folks eager to get back on the wagon .

The potential for real - time ray tracing has been a major talking point in 3D graphics ever since Intel announced its plans for the x86 - based multi-core Larrabee discrete graphics chip at IDF in 2007 .
However , a new graphics company called Caustic Graphics reckons that it ’s already uncovered the secret of real - time ray tracing with a chip that it saysCaustic ’s management team includes previous employees of Autodesk , Apple , ATI , Intel and Nvidia , and the company has already developed a chip for accelerating ray tracing .
Called the CausticOne , the new chip is n’t targeted at gamers , but is instead aimed at 3D professionals in the film , game development , automotive and consumer product design industries .
This is n’t surprising , given that current gaming APIs are based on rasterisation , but Caustic is still making some impressive claims about its technology , while not being afraid to rubbish the efforts of other graphics companies when it comes to ray tracing .
says Caustic , referring to companies such as Nvidia which recently demonstrated real - time ray tracing using CUDA .
However , the company adds that According to Caustic , this is because the advanced shading and lighting effects usually seen in ray - traced scenes , such as caustics and refraction , ca n’t be accelerated on a standard GPU because of incoherent rays .
Caustic explains thatConversely , Caustic claims that the CausticOneExplaining why traditional algorithms and parallel processing is n’t the best system for ray tracing , Caustic said that they To accompany the CausticOne , the company is also introducing its own API , called CausticGL , which is based on OpenGL / GLSL .
The API will feature Caustic ’s unique ray tracing extensions , and Caustic says it will alsoThe company says that the CausticOne ( which has 15 patents pending on the technology and algorithms used ) basically off - loads raytracing calculations and then sends the data to your GPU and CPU , enabling your PC to shade a ray traced scene much more quickly .
The CausticOne is due to be released in April 2009 , and Caustic claims that it will speed up the ray tracing process by an average of 20x .
However , the company is making wilder claims about its second - generation Caustic product , due to be released early next year , which it says will offerAccording to Caustic , the huge speed jump is due to the company implementing its own patent - pending ray tracing algorithms in a piece of silicon .
Explaining the need for ray tracing acceleration , Caustic Graphics ’ CEO , Ken Daniels said that According to Daniels , Meanwhile , Jon Peddie of Jon Peddie Research was keen to congratulate Caustic Graphics on its new technology .
said Peddie , Do you work with ray tracers in your field of work , and would you be interested in a ray tracing accelerator such as this ?
Plus , when do you think we ’ll ever see real - time ray tracing in games ?
As always , let us know your thoughts in the forums

World Bank predicts first decline in global output since WWII
By Jerry White
10 March 2009
In a report issued Sunday , the World Bank said the global economy would shrink this year for the first time since World War II .
The international institution said global gross domestic product was in line to fall five percentage points below what it considered the natural growth rate of the world economy , with industrial production falling by as much as 15 percent lower than levels in 2008 .
The report painted a far more dire picture than the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) did just ten weeks ago , when it estimated the world economy would see a small overall increase of half a percent in 2009 .
The bank did not give a specific target for global GDP contraction .
The World Bank said growth prospects for so - called emerging market and developing countries had been revised sharply downward along with the advanced countries , where declines in GDP this year are expected to range from around 6 percent in the US and Europe to nearly 13 percent in Japan .
The crisis in the poorer countries is largely due to a virtual collapse in world trade , driven by weakened demand for exports from the industrialized nations and the drying up of credit to finance trade .
They have also been hit by falling commodity prices ( non-energy commodities fell 38 percent in the second half of last year ) and a staggering decline in foreign direct investment .
In a separate report released Monday , the Asian Development Bank ( ADB ) said that the value of global financial assets , including stocks , bonds and currencies , fell by more than $ 50 trillion in 2008 , equivalent to a year of world GDP .
Asia , excluding Japan lost about $ 9.6 trillion , while the Latin American region saw the value of financial assets drop by about $ 2.1 trillion .
" This crisis is the first truly universal one in the history of humanity , " former IMF Managing Director Michel Camdessus said at an ADB forum in Manila Monday .
" No country escapes from it .
It has not yet bottomed out . "
The World Bank said global trade would experience its largest decline in 80 years and the first contraction since 1982 .
Of the 51 economies reporting fourth quarter data for 2008 , 36 showed double - digit declines in nominal exports relative to a year ago .
Many European countries , including the United Kingdom and Spain , as well as developing countries such as Indonesia , Philippines and Turkey , registered a drop in exports of 20 percent or more .
The report highlighted the devastating impact of the crisis on Asia , Latin America and Africa , as well as Central and Eastern Europe .
Of the 116 developing countries , the World Bank said , 94 had experienced a slowdown in economic growth .
The most affected were export - driven countries , heavily dependent on foreign investment , where millions of construction , mining and manufacturing jobs have been wiped out .
The number of people in poverty in these countries was expected to grow by 46 million people in 2009 , chiefly because of mass unemployment .
The report cited an International Labour Organization forecast that global job losses could hit 51 million , and up to 30 million workers could become unemployed .
In China , some 20 million have already lost their jobs .
Cambodia has lost 30,000 jobs in the garment industry , its only significant export industry .
More than half a million jobs were lost in the last three months of 2008 in India , including in gems and jewelry , autos and textiles .
In addition , remittance flows — the income immigrant workers send home to their families — were expected to drop sharply in 2009 , as migrants lost their jobs and many returned to their countries of origin .
This was expected to deprive developing countries of a crucial source of income , estimated to be worth $ 305 billion in 2008 .
Foreign direct investment was also grinding to a halt in economies where growth is dependent on providing a high return to investors with low taxes , little regulation and low cost labor .
In addition , lending to Africa all but dried up in 2008 , with no international bond issues by African countries , compared with $ 6.5 billion in 2007 .
Because of this , the institution said , developing nations would face a shortfall of between $ 270 billion and $ 700 billion to pay for imports and debt servicing , while only one - quarter had internal resources to try to blunt the impact of the crisis , through job - creation or safety net programs .
In a press release , World Bank Group President Robert B. Zoellick appealed to officials attending this weekend 's Group of 20 meeting of finance ministers , saying urgent measures were needed to prevent the danger of " social and political unrest . "
" This global crisis needs a global solution , " Zoellick said .
The World Bank is asking the G20 countries to put 0.7 percent of the money from their stimulus packages to set up a global Vulnerability Fund .
The proposal , however , is little more than a band - aid , aimed at increasing funding for micro-credit programs to encourage entrepreneurship among impoverished townspeople and villagers and funding minimal infrastructure projects .
The key to stabilizing the situation , however , the World Bank said , would be to renew growth in world trade .
However , rather than an internationally coordinated response , the World Bank complained , governments were promoting the interests of nationally based corporations at the expense of their economic competitors .
" [ O ]ne of the greatest threats to increased trade flows , " the report said , was " protectionism and beggar - thy - neighbor policies , which need to be resolutely resisted . "
It went on to criticize trade restrictions implemented by G20 countries over the last year , the spike in " anti- dumping " actions , the tightening of licensing and product standards against imports and the measures in the various stimulus packages aimed at strengthening domestic industries and banks .
The US has come under increasing international criticism for opposing the imposition of international regulations on its banks and hedge funds .
At the same time the US is absorbing the bulk of the world 's available credit to pay for the trillions the government has handed to the Wall Street banks and the cost of the stimulus package .
The New York Times noted Monday , " As the world is seized with anxiety in the face of a spreading financial crisis , the one place having a considerably easier time attracting money is , perversely enough , the same place that started much of the trouble : the United States . "
US investors are pulling out of foreign markets and buying government bonds .
At the same time , foreign holdings of Treasury Bills rose by $ 456 billion in 2008 , according to Federal Reserve data .
Meanwhile , private investment in the emerging countries plunged from $ 928 billion in 2007 to $ 466 billion last year and is likely to fall to $ 165 billion this year , according to the Institute of International Finance .
This outcome is not simply a product of the neutral operations of the market but a deliberate policy being pursued by the Obama administration aimed at financing its bank rescue plans through the sale of government debt , capitalizing on the privileged position of the US dollar on world currency markets .
By doing this the US hopes to shift the crisis onto the backs of its economic rivals and the poorest countries , which are being hammered by declining currencies and plunging commodity prices .
While focusing on the impact of the crisis on the so - called developing world , the World Bank described a simultaneous breakdown of the world capitalist system virtually without historical parallel .
Suggested , but left unsaid , was that the social and political consequences of the present crisis would be no less explosive than the period of economic turmoil , revolutions and imperialist conflicts that produced the Second World War , the last time the world economy as a whole contracted .
I was once in Melbourne when bush fires were raging 20 or 30 miles north of the city .
Even from that distance you could smell the burning .
Fine fragments of ash , like slivers of charcoal confetti , covered the pavements .
The very air was charred .
It has been the same here these past couple of months with the fighting in Gaza .
Only the air has been charred not with devastation but with hatred .
And I do n’t mean the hatred of the warring parties for each other .
I mean the hatred of Israel expressed in our streets , on our campuses , in our newspapers , on our radios and televisions , and now in our theatres .
A discriminatory , over - and - above hatred , inexplicable in its hysteria and virulence whatever justification is adduced for it ; an unreasoning , deranged and as far as I can see irreversible revulsion that is poisoning everything we are supposed to believe in here – the free exchange of opinions , the clear - headedness of thinkers and teachers , the fine tracery of social interdependence we call community relations , modernity of outlook , tolerance , truth .
You can taste the toxins on your tongue .
But I am not allowed to ascribe any of this to anti-Semitism .
It is , I am assured , “ criticism ” of Israel , pure and simple .
In the matter of Israel and the Palestinians this country has been heading towards a dictatorship of the one - minded for a long time ; we seem now to have attained it .
Deviate a fraction of a moral millimetre from the prevailing othodoxy and you are either not listened to or you are jeered at and abused , your reading of history trashed , your humanity itself called into question .
I do n’t say that self - pityingly .
As always with dictatorships of the mind , the worst harmed are not the ones not listened to , but the ones not listening .
So leave them to it , has essentially been my philosophy .
A life spent singing anti-Zionist carols in the company of Ken Livingstone and George Galloway is its own punishment .

But responses to the fighting in Gaza have been such as to drive even the most quiescent of English Jews – whether quiescent because we have learnt to expect nothing else , or because we are desperate to avoid trouble , or because we have our own frustrations with Israel to deal with – out of our usual stoical reserve .
Some things cannot any longer go unchallenged .
My first challenge is implicit in the phrase “ the fighting in Gaza ” , which more justly describes the event than the words “ Massacre ” and “ Slaughter ” which anti-Israel demonstrators carry on their placards .
This is not a linguistic ploy on my part to play down the horror of Gaza or to minimise the loss of life .
In an article in this newspaper last week , Robert Fisk argued that “ a Palestinian woman and her child are as worthy of life as a Jewish woman and her child on the back of a lorry in Auschwitz ” .
I am not sure who he was arguing with , but it certainly is n’t me .
I do not differentiate between the worth of lives and no more wish to harm or see harmed the hair of a single Palestinian than do those who make cause , here in safe cosy old easy - come easy - go England , with Hamas .
Indeed , given Hamas ’s record of violence to its own people – read the latest report from Amnesty if you doubt it – it ’s possible I wish to harm the hair of a single Palestinian less .
But that might be rhetoric in which case I apologise for it .

Rhetoric is precisely what has warped report and analysis these past months , and in the process made life fraught for most English Jews who , like me , do not differentiate between the worth of Jewish and Palestinian lives , though the imputation – loud and clear in a new hate - fuelled little chamber - piece by Caryl Churchill – is that Jews do .
“ Massacre ” and “ Slaughter ” are rhetorical terms .
They determine the issue before it can begin to be discussed .
Are you for massacre or are you not ?
When did you stop slaughtering your wife ?
I watched demonstrators approach members of the public with their petitions .
“ Do you want an end to the slaughter in Gaza ? ”
What were those approached expected to reply ?
– “ No , I want it to continue unabated . ”
If “ Massacre ” presumes indiscriminate , “ Slaughter ” presumes innocence .
There is no dodging the second of those .
In Gaza the innocent have suffered unbearably .
But it is in the nature of modern war , where soldiers no longer toss grenades at one another from their trenches , that the innocent pay .
Live television pictures of civilian fatalities rightly distress and anger us .
Similar pictures of the damage this country did to the innocent of Berlin would have distressed and angered us no less .
The outrage we feel does credit to our humanity , but says nothing about the justice of a particular war .
Insist that all wars are too cruel ever to be called just , argue that any discharge of weapons in the vicinity of the innocent is murderous , and you will meet no resistance from me ; but you will have in the same breath to implicate Hamas who make a virtue of endangering their own civilian population , and who , as everyone knows but many choose to discount , have been firing rockets into Israeli towns for years .
The inefficiency of those rockets , landing God knows where and upon God knows whom , is often cited to minimise the offence .
As though murderous intention can be mitigated by the obsolescence of the weaponry .
In fact the inefficiency only exacerbates the crime .
How much more indiscriminate can you be than to lob unstable rockets into civilian areas and hope for a hit ?
Massacre manqué , we might call it – slaughter in all but a good aim .
And this not from some disaffected group we might liken to the IRA , but the legitimately elected government of Gaza .
If it is a war crime for one government to fire on civilians , it is a war crime for another .
But when a protester joined a demonstration at Sheffield University recently , calling on both sides to desist , her placard was seized and trampled underfoot , while the young in their liberation scarves and embryo compassion looked on and said not one word .
And Israel ?
Well , speaking on BBC television at the height of the fighting , Richard Kemp , former commander of British Troops in Afghanistan and a senior military adviser to the British government , said the following : “ I do n’t think there has ever been a time in the history of warfare where any army has made more efforts to reduce civilian casualties and deaths of civilians than the IDF ( Israeli Defence Forces ) is doing today in Gaza . ”
A judgement I can no more corroborate than those who think very differently can disprove .
Right or wrong , it was a contribution to the argument from someone who is more informed on military matters than most of us , but did it make a blind bit of difference to the tone of popular execration ?
It did not .
When it comes to Israel we hear no good , see no good , speak no good .
We turn our backsides to what we do not want to know about and bury it in distaste , like our own ordure .
We did it and go on doing it with all official contestation of the mortality figures provided by Hamas .
We do it with Hamas ’s own private executions and their policy of deploying human shields .
We do it with the sotto voce admission by the UN that “ a clerical error ” caused it to mis-describe the bombing of that UN school which at the time was all the proof we needed of Israel ’s savagery .
It now turns out that Israel did not bomb the school at all .
But there ’s no emotional mileage in a correction .
The libel sticks , the retraction goes unnoticed .
But I am not allowed to ascribe any of this to anti-Semitism .
It is criticism of Israel , pure and simple .
A laughably benign locution , “ criticism ” , for what is in fact – what has in recent years become – a desire to word a country not just out of the commonwealth of nations but out of physical existence altogether .
Richard Ingrams daydreams of the time when Israel will no longer be , an after - dinner sleep which is more than an old man ’s idle prophesying .
It is for him a consummation devoutly to be wished .
This week Bruce Anderson also looked to such a time , but in his case with profound regret .
Israel has missed and goes on missing chances to be magnanimous , he argued , as no victor has ever been before .
That ’s a high expectation , but I am in sympathy with it , and it is an expectation in line with what Israel ’s greatest writers and peace campaigners – Amos Oz , A.B. Yehoshua , David Grossman – have been saying for years .
Though it is interesting that not a one of those believed such magnanimity included allowing Hamas ’s rockets to go on falling unhindered into Israel .
Was not the original withdrawal from Gaza and the dismantling of the rightly detested settlements a sufficient signal of peaceful intent , and a sufficient opportunity for it to be reciprocated ?
Magnanimity is by definition unilateral , but it takes two for it to be more than a suicidal gesture .
And the question has to be asked whether a Jewish state , however magnanimous and conciliatory , will ever be accepted in the Middle East .
But my argument is not with the Palestinians or even with Hamas .
People in the thick of it pursue their own agenda as best they can .
But what ’s our agenda ?
What do we , in the cosy safety of tolerant old England , think we are doing when we call the Israelis Nazis and liken Gaza to the Warsaw Ghetto ?
Do those who blithely make these comparisons know anything whereof they speak ?
In the early 1940s some 100,000 Jews and Romanis died of engineered starvation and disease in the Warsaw Ghetto , another quarter of a million were transported to the death camps , and when the Ghetto rose up it was liquidated , the last 50,000 residents being either shot on the spot or sent to be murdered more hygienically in Treblinka .
Do n’t mistake me : every Palestinian killed in Gaza is a Palestinian too many , but there is not the remotest similarity , either in intention or in deed – even in the most grossly mis-reported deed – between Gaza and Warsaw .
Given the number of besieged and battered cities there have been in however many thousands of years of pitiless warfare there is only one explanation for this invocation of Warsaw before any of those – it is to wound Jews in their recent and most anguished history and to punish them with their own grief .
Its aim is a sort of retrospective retribution , cancelling out all debts of guilt and sorrow .
It is as though , by a reversal of the usual laws of cause and effect , Jewish actions of today prove that Jews had it coming to them yesterday .
Berating Jews with their own history , disinheriting them of pity , as though pity is negotiable or has a sell - by date , is the latest species of Holocaust denial , infinitely more subtle than the David Irving version with its clunking body counts and quibbles over gas - chamber capability and chimney sizes .
Instead of saying the Holocaust did n’t happen , the modern sophisticated denier accepts the event in all its terrible enormity , only to accuse the Jews of trying to profit from it , either in the form of moral blackmail or downright territorial theft .
According to this thinking , the Jews have betrayed the Holocaust and become unworthy of it , the true heirs to their suffering being the Palestinians .
Thus , here and there throughout the world this year , Holocaust day was temporarily annulled or boycotted on account of Gaza , dead Jews being found guilty of the sins of live ones .
Anti-Semitism ?
Absolutely not .
It is “ criticism ” of Israel , pure and simple .
A number of variations on the above sophistical nastiness have been fermenting in the more febrile of our campuses for some time .
One particularly popular version , pseudo - scientific in tone , understands Zionism as a political form given to a psychological condition – Jews visiting upon others the traumas suffered by themselves , with Israel figuring as the torture room in which they do it .
This is is pretty well the thesis of Caryl Churchill ’s Seven Jewish Children , an audacious 10 - minute encapsulation of Israel ’s moral collapse – the audacity residing in its ignorance or its dishonesty – currently playing at the Royal Court .
The play is conceived in the form of a family roundelay , with different voices chiming in with suggestions as to the best way to bring up , protect , inform , and ultimately inflame into animality an unseen child in each of the chosen seven periods of contemporary Jewish history .
It begins with the Holocaust , partly to establish the playwright ’s sympathetic bona fides ( “ Tell her not to come out even if she hears shouting ” ) , partly to explain what has befallen Palestine , because no sooner are the Jews out of the hell of Hitler ’s Europe than they are constructing a parallel hell for Palestinians .
Anyone with scant knowledge of the history of Israeli - Palestinian relations – that is to say , judging from what they chant , the majority of anti-Israel demonstrators – would assume from this that Jews descended on the country as from a clear blue sky ; that they had no prior association with the land other than in religious fantasy and through some scarce remembered genealogical affiliation :
“ Tell her it ’s the land God gave us / ...
Tell her her great great great great lots of greats grandad lived there ” – the latter line garnering much knowing laughter in the theatre the night I was there , by virtue of the predatiousness lurking behind the childlike vagueness .
You cannot of course tell the whole story of anywhere in 10 minutes , but then why would you want to unless you conceive it to be simple and one - sided ?
The staccato form of the piece – every line beginning “ Tell her ” or “ Do n’t tell her ” – is skilfully contrived to suggest a people not just forever fraught and frightened but forever covert and deceitful .
Nothing is true .
Boasts are denials and denials are boasts .
Everything is mediated through the desire to put the best face , first on fear , then on devious appropriation , and finally on evil .
That being the case , it is hard to be certain what the playwright knows and what she does n’t , what she , in her turn , means deliberately to twist or just unthinkingly helps herself to from the poor box of leftist propaganda .
The overall impression , nonetheless , is of a narrative slavishly in line with the familiar rhetoric , making little or nothing of the Jews ’ unbroken connection with the country going back to the Arab conquest more than a thousand years before , the piety felt for the land , the respect for its non-Jewish inhabitants ( their rights must “ be guarded and honoured punctiliously , ” Ben Gurion wrote in 1918 ) , the waves of idealistic immigration which long predated the post - Holocaust influx with its twisted psychology , and the hopes of peaceful co-existence , for the tragic dashing of which Arab countries in their own obduracy and intolerance bear no less responsibility .
Quite simply , in this wantonly inflammatory piece , the Jews drop in on somewhere they have no right to be , despise , conquer , and at last revel in the spilling of Palestinian blood .
There is a one - line equivocal mention of a suicide bomber , and ditto of rockets , both compromised by the “ Tell her ” device , otherwise no Arab lifts a finger against a Jew .
“ Tell her about Jerusalem , ” but no one tells her , for example , that the Jewish population of East Jersusalem was expelled at about the time our survivors turn up , that it was cleansed from the city and its sacred places desecrated or destroyed .
Only in the crazed brains of Israelis can the motives for any of their subsequent actions be found .
Thus lie follows lie , omission follows omission , until , in the tenth and final minute , we have a stage populated by monsters who kill babies by design – “ Tell her we killed the babies by mistake , ” one says , meaning do n’t tell her what we really did – who laugh when they see a dead Palestinian policeman ( “ Tell her they ’re animals ...
Tell her I would n’t care if we wiped them out ” ) , who consider themselves the “ chosen people ” , and who admit to feeling happy when they see Palestinian “ children covered in blood ” .
Anti-Semitic ?
No , no .
Just criticism of Israel .
Only imagine this as Seven Muslim Children and we know that the Royal Court would never have had the courage or the foolhardiness to stage it .
I say that with no malice towards Muslims .
I do not approve of censorship but I admire their unwillingness to be traduced .
It would seem that we Jews , however , for all our ingrained brutality – we English Jews at least – are considered a soft touch .
You can say what you like about us , safe in the knowledge that while we slaughter babies and laugh at murdered policemen ( “ Tell her we ’re the iron fist now ” ) we will squeak no louder than a mouse when we are abused .
Caryl Churchill will argue that her play is about Israelis not Jews , but once you venture on to “ chosen people ” territory – feeding all the ancient prejudice against that miscomprehended phrase – once you repeat in another form the medieval blood - libel of Jews rejoicing in the murder of little children , you have crossed over .
This is the old stuff .
Jew - hating pure and simple – Jew - hating which the haters do n’t even recognise in themselves , so acculturated is it – the Jew - hating which many of us have always suspected was the only explanation for the disgust that contorts and disfigures faces when the mere word Israel crops up in conversation .
So for that we are grateful .
At last that mystery is solved and that lie finally nailed .
No , you do n’t have to be an anti-Semite to criticise Israel .
It just so happens that you are .
If one could simply leave them to it one would .
It ’s a hell of its own making , hating Jews for a living .
Only think of the company you must keep .
But these things are catching .
Take Michael Billington ’s somnolent review of the play in the Guardian .
I would imagine that any accusation of anti-Semitism would horrify Michael Billington .
And I certainly do n’t make it .
But if you wanted an example of how language itself can sleepwalk the most innocent towards racism , then here it is .
“ Churchill shows us , ” he writes , “ how Jewish children are bred to believe in the ‘ otherness ’ of Palestinians ... ”
It is not just the adopted elision of Israeli children into Jewish children that is alarming , or the unquestioning acceptance of Caryl Churchill ’s offered insider knowledge of Israeli child - rearing , what ’s most chilling is that lazy use of the word “ bred ” , so rich in eugenic and bestial connotations , but inadvertently slipped back into the conversation now , as truth .
Fact : Jews breed children in order to deny Palestinians their humanity .
Watching another play in the same week , Billington complains about its manipulation of racial stereotypes .
He does n’t , you see , even notice the inconsistency .
And so it happens .
Without one ’s being aware of it , it happens .
A gradual habituation to the language of loathing .
Passed from the culpable to the unwary and back again .
And soon , before you know it ...
Not here , though .
Not in cosy old lazy old easy - come easy - go England .
A white man strides into an African village .
The black villagers start morphing into crazed zombies , wielding pitchforks and knives .
The white man starts shooting them down .
The scene was depicted in a 2007 promotional trailer ( embedded above : warning , it 's a little scary ) for Resident Evil 5 , a video game that 's set to be released next month .
A blog called Black Looks , which comments on issues of race and gender , condemned the video's " depiction of Black people as inhuman savages , the killing of Black people by a white man in military clothing , and the fact that this video game is marketed to children and young adults .
Start them young … fearing , hating , and destroying black people . "
With the game finally close to release , some blogs have started revisiting the issue of whether Resident Evil 5 is racist .
We asked Capcom , the Japanese company that made the game , what its developers had intended .
Spokesman Chris Kramer told us :
The Resident Evil series has been around since 1996 .
It was first set in the American Midwest , and since then , it 's gone to South America , Antarctica and Spain .
For Resident Evil 5 , our developers wanted to focus on pushing the current generation console 's capabilities for rendering light .
They wanted to see if they could make light as fearful as shadows .
They wanted the players to go from a dark environment to a bright setting , when they 're momentarily blinded .
As their pupils adjust , they become vulnerable to attack .
They wanted a location that would have hot , bright , flat light .
And they chose Africa .
Kramer also noted that the original story for Resident Evil referenced a virus that was engineered somewhere in Africa .
Returning to the continent brings the story full circle , he said .
Finally , Kramer pointed out that prior versions of the game , which has sold 34 million copies worldwide , featured Americans , Asians , Spaniards and Latin Americans .
Few are in a position to make a judgment ; the game has n't been released yet , and only its developers know how the entire game unfolds .
So we interviewed two African American actors who played leading roles in Resident Evil 5 to see if they thought the game had racist overtones .
They said ...
In a quiet suburban town in the summer of 1958 , two recently orphaned sisters , Meg and disabled Susan are placed in the care of their mentally unstable aunt Ruth .
But Ruth 's depraved sense of discipline will soon lead to unspeakable acts of abuse and torture that involve her young sons , Willie , Ralphie , and Donny the neighborhood children , and one 12 - year - old boy , David whose life will be changed forever .

There 's this " high wire " act being played out over elections and state 's rights .
Elections are states ' rights territory , which is why we have so much of a mess , state by state , yet HAVA , is a federal law , mandate on voting , including some requirements .
And we should reverse privatization in voting .
The government should be in charge of all aspects of the elections .
What a concept !
How many countries in the world have a system like ours , if you can call it " a system " ?

Yep , it was HAVA that mandated ... and it was the states , in the form of activists , academia , state election officials and Secretaries of State who pushed back .
If not for the states then the EAC would now be be mandating e-voting for all ... no exceptions .
Hell , the EAC has already been caught telling state election officials that HAVA made e-voting
mandatory anyway ... which it did not .
They'd have gotten away with it too ... if not for those darn bloggers !

OT : Franken - Coleman Election Contest Hey Brad ,
Like you , I wondered why the MN Supreme Court would let the candidates have veto power over absentee ballots .
But there 's a method to their madness .
It turns out that it 's settled law and by following it , the Supes made it more difficult for Coleman to appeal : http://campaignsilo.fire...022309-a-few-loose-ends/

" Allowing " states to run their own elections smacks of top / down bias totally inconsistent with the system of shared power our country 's based on .
If we 're going to have a revolution against federalism in favor of " unity " or " Uniformity " or against " so much of a mess , state by state " then let 's have an open , honest , transparent debate about whether a revolutionary alteration of our political structure to eliminate federalism in elections ( aka " state 's rights " ) is or is n't a good idea .
Just because we had one historical experience ( the Voting Rights Act ) in which a problem was regionally isolated to the South and a few pockets elsewhere does NOT mean that the feds are superior in solving a systemic nationwide problem whose primary driver is HAVA , a federal law .
so add to Bev Harris 's silent revolution against self - government the silent revolution against decentralized or shared power .
One has a much better chance ( even if it 's still not a powerful chance ) of influencing one 's own state representatives from much smaller districts than one does in influencing Congresscritters .
Thus , eliminating state 's rights moves ever more power upward to Washington DC , where it take real serious money , power and / or incredible nationwide organizational efforts to have an effect .

Holt , we 're told that private vendors " won " in some undefined power negotiation at which I highly doubt the principles of JEfferson or any other freedom loving person were vigorously advocated .
No rational informed person would agree to secret vote counting .
Yet that 's what Holt says the riddance of which " can't win " against the corporate vendors .
Such preposterous statements can't survive the light of a transparent public debate , thus all they can do is IGNORE the people , their rights , and blithely and without support declare victory before there 's even been a public debate .
Bottom line : the increase in top / down control that would come with decreased federalism / local control / state 's rights in elections is one major component of the revolution against self - government , in favor of a top - down DC run oligarchy of some sort .

About done with my analysis of the draft version of the bill .
Question : If Representative
Holt turns out to again be unreceptive to input on the things that matter ... do we draft and float our own version of the bill as an example of the minimum that needs to be done before 2010 ?

Thank you , Brad Friedman for being first out of the gate to speak out against this abomination ( again ) !
And thank you Paul Lehto for your excellent post .
Indeed , we are seeing a surreptitious but effective attack on democratic elections in the following areas : a )
The genious of democracy is dispersal of power , yet , as Paul Lehto points out , the Holt Bill , and Internet voting proposals afoot in Washington state and elsewhere , seek to centralize power .
b)
Self - government cannot co-exist with secret vote counting .
If you can make a case otherwise , please do --- I cannot imagine how a system where government insiders count our votes in secret can be compatible with self - government .
And if we do not control the government WE set up and WE pay for , we are slaves .
c)
We are also seeing attempts to strip away political privacy , from overt recommendations to do away with the secret ballot ( unwise , and a ridiculous concept in this age of data mining and manipulation ) .
These efforts include Internet voting ( which will delete your political privacy ) , unique identifiers on ballots ( which the new scanners can capture in databases matched to your vote ) ; and ballot tracking software .
We have a new administration , but because of the subtlety of these quiet attacks on the firmament of our democratic structure , we are in fact at a stage where the risk to self - government can be characterized as " a clear and present danger . "

I wonder how Congress would react to a bill barring the public and the press from all criminal trials .
Why do n't we ask Mr. Holt how he'd feel about that and if he objects let him give us his reasons .
That would be an interesting exercise .
Maybe
Holt would protest , explaining that publicity provides an essential check against abuse and assures the owners of the government , the public , that the trial is fair .
Because after all , " One of the demands of a democratic society is that the public should know ... to the end that the public may judge whether our system ... is fair and right . "
But do we really need to judge with our own eyes ?
Why should n't we have confidence that the judge and prosecutor and defense attorney will always do the right thing .
I mean just because we 've abhorred secret trials all these centuries , times are different now , right ?
But , an honest public servant worthy of his office would protest : " Public access is essential ... to achieving the objective of maintaining public confidence . "
That 's OK Rush , - we'd be happy just getting the transcript .
We do n't need to actually observe the trial .
But being a learned man and a representative of the people , Mr Holt might admonish us : " Publicity serves as a check upon ... officials .
Recordation ... in the character of checks ... operate[s ] rather as a cloak than check ; as cloak in reality , as check only in appearance . "
Nah , we trust you , after all you 're our government , why should n't we ?
To which a representative of Congress , sworn to uphold the constitution might insist , but open trials are important .
" Open trials give assurance that the proceedings were conducted fairly ... and discourage ... misconduct . "
That 's OK , we 'd demure .
We have busy lives you know .
Who needs access to actually observe government functiong .
After all there 's a prosecutor and a defense attorney - that 's what 's government is for - to take care of the people 's business .
You 're all honest guys right ?
I mean you took that oath of office did n't you ?
And if Mr. Holt was qualified to serve as a representative of the people we'd expect he'd be familiar with the constitution and the decisions of the highest courts .
In which case he'd remind us that the public 's " presence serves to assure the integrity of what goes on . "
And that
" [ O ] pen ... proceedings are essential to fulfill the ... guarantees to the people of this Nation that they shall retain the necessary means of control over their institutions . "
Control over our institutions , huh ?
We have that right ?
* the above referenced quotes were all taken from the Supreme Court decision in Richmond Newspapers Inc. v Virginia , 100 S.Ct. 2814 ( 1980 ) in which the court recognized the public had a constitutionally protected right to observe and attend criminal trials for all of the reasons articulated above , and more .

We really do n't need " sophisticated " computer technology to count votes in our elections .
We could have a transparent election process using standard video technology and transparent plexiglass ballot boxes .
Train a video camera(s ) on each election precinct polling place with the signal fed to an internet website channel that could be viewed by any member of the public anywhere in the country to that verify honest election procedures are followed .
The video record of the election process at the precinct level could be stored and retrievable from the internet , as well .
At the end of the election day , each voting precinct could have a couple of well rested and fresh election officials come in to do an efficient and speedy manual tally at a blackboard , pulling out each ballot and marking the results on the blackboard in video view of the internet web world .
There would be hundreds of such precinct voting channels operating simultaneously on the web , with local , state , and national viewers and journalists monitoring results in real - time at the most basic local level to the top election center compiling the individual precincts ' raw vote tallies .
The simplest computers running spreadsheet software , or even electronic calculators , or pencil and paper , could be easily used for tabulating and verifying the results from each of the precincts to compile totals for the election contests of the larger legislative districts , townships , counties , states , etc .
Every citizen would have the information at their disposal on the web to do their own personal verification of the honesty of the process and the tallies at any and every election precinct .
If each voting precinct only had , say , 500 or 1000 voters ' ballots to distribute , collect , and count at the end of the day , it need not take but a few hours for any precinct to complete a vote tally .
If all of these precincts do this counting nearly simultaneously in any time zone , state , or region , the time required to count any one precinct 's votes should be about the same to have all of the precincts ' votes tallied .

I 'm tellin ' ya Bev , if the Corporations want personhood they have to fold up and dissolve after 38 years or so , the same length of time as an average person 's productivity .
There is no such thing as a person that does not die , the corporations can't have it both ways .
Get them the fuck out of the peoples business .

Oregon has a bill in the legislature this session to allow evoting for overseas military .
The camel 's nose under the tent .
We have all mail - in voting here , with counting by optical scan at the county elections department .
I agree with Brad , that it is ripe for fraud .
Last session a voter protection organization submitted a bill that required random hand counts to verify votes in precincts throughout the state .
However , the State Director of Elections and Democratic Senator Kate Brown ( Majority Leader of the Senate and now our Secretary of State ) gutted the bill and replaced it with an ineffective " placebo " check on validity of the vote .
It is a sad story .
We need to go back to precinct voting AND COUNTING .
I agree with videotaping everything .

Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton said Friday that she would not emphasize contentious issues such as human rights in talks this weekend with the Chinese , focusing instead on topics on which progress may be more likely : the global economy , climate change and security issues .
Clinton ’s weeklong tour of Asia culminates with meetings in China , where she is remembered for a tough 1995 speech on human rights .
But she said that after years of pressing Beijing , the dialogue on human rights , freedom for Tibet and accommodation with Taiwan had grown predictable .
“ We know what they ’re going to say because I ’ve had those kinds of conversations for more than a decade with Chinese leaders , ” Clinton told reporters .
“ We have to continue to press them .
But our pressing on these issues can’t interfere with the global economic crisis , the global climate change crisis and the security crisis . ”

Clinton wants a broader dialogue with China as an important feature of her tenure .
But she faces challenges on the difficult questions of rights , which are followed with intense interest by important constituencies , some tied to her Democratic Party base .
Her comments upset rights groups who see freedom of the press and of speech as closely connected to economic , environmental and security issues .
“ Secretary Clinton ’s remarks point to a diplomatic strategy that has worked well for the Chinese government -- segregating human rights issues into a dead - end ‘ dialogue of the deaf , ’ ” said Sophie Richardson , Asia advocacy director at Human Rights Watch .
“ A new approach is needed . ”
T. Kumar , of Amnesty International USA , said , “ It ’s not too late for Secretary Clinton to do the right thing for the Chinese people .
Amnesty International urges Secretary Clinton to repair the damage caused by her statement and publicly declare that human rights are central to U.S. - China relations before she leaves Beijing . ”

Clinton said she planned to visit a state - sanctioned church Sunday morning but did not wish to draw heightened attention to the stop .
“ My intention was just to go to church , ” she said .
She plans also to talk to some Chinese who are not connected to the government .
Rights issues may come up in those conversations , but aides said she planned no special meetings with activists .
Chinese officials have said they welcome a broadened dialogue with the United States , but it is unclear how enthusiastic they are about those conversations .
In wide - ranging talks with U.S. officials , economic issues have dominated .

Clinton traveled to China after a one - day visit to South Korea , which ended with a strong statement of support for the South Korean government and stern words for North Korea .
In an appearance with South Korean Foreign Minister Yu Myung - hwan , Clinton said North Korea “ is not going to get a different relationship with the United States while insulting and refusing dialogue with ” South Korea .
She referred to North Korea as a “ tyranny ” and , later in the day , as the “ hermit kingdom , ” referring to its secretive nature .
South Korea ’s government has been worried that the Obama administration ’s declared interest in talking to adversaries might weaken the traditionally strong U.S. relationship with Seoul .
American officials have been eager to dispel that fear and to make it clear that they can be tough when required .

Kerry shakes things up at the SFRC
Sen . John Kerry ( D - MA ) is shaking things up .
The new chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee has revived a tradition once started by Senator Fulbright , holding regular round tables with policy and regional experts , at which senators and invited experts sit around a table and have discussions with each other , rather than the more formal , traditional hearings formats .
He has hired a top investigative journalist to lead the committee ’s investigations arm , and a former investment banker to advise the committee on the intersection of global finance and foreign policy .
And this past Wednesday night , he and his wife Teresa Heinz Kerry had committee members of both parties and their spouses over for dinner at their Georgetown home .
The round tables — there have been ones on Afghanistan , Sudan , and how the international financial crisis affects U.S. foreign policy already the past couple weeks — “ are done to really create a non-adversarial environment where senators come from behind the dais and sit with the witnesses / guests and participate in more of a dialogue as opposed to the inquisition style that is traditional in hearings , ” says committee spokesman Frederick Jones .
“ I think Sen . Kerry wants to give and take … and it ’s a format that helps engender free - flowing dialogue , ” Jones added .
( Democratic sources said vice chairman Richard Lugar ( R - IN ) did n’t show up to the first round table on Afghanistan , and said Lugar did n’t seem fond of the new format .
A call to his spokesman was n’t immediately returned ) .
Kerry has hired Douglas Frantz , the former Los Angeles Times managing editor , to lead the committee ’s investigative wing .
The committee wo n’t specify what Frantz , who recently coauthored a book on Pakistani nuclear proliferator A.Q. Khan , plans to investigate .
But sources note that he ’s currently in Vienna , the seat of the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
Sources tell The Cable that the pro-Israel lobby group the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( AIPAC ) has encouraged Kerry and other members to probe Iran ’s alleged sanctions busting , and how the country might bypass international sanctions to supply its nuclear program .
“ For sure folks are strongly supportive of congressional and U.S. efforts to go after trans - shipment issues , often through the UAE , but in other places as well , that the Iranians have been using to bring in dual use items and other things not allowed under the sanctions , ” a source following the Iran issue said on condition of anonymity .
With the recent U.S. - UAE nuclear power deal , “ there is increased expectation on the Hill that the UAE will do a better job of cracking down on their country being used by Iran to push their nuclear programs forward and step up their effort to help ensure the economic sanctions are n’t being violated under their noses . ”
Kerry ’s committee has also hired international financial expert Heidi Crebo - Rediker from the New America Foundation to head up a new SFRC focus on international finance and economics .
“ This is a new position that Senator Kerry created to better marry finance and economics with foreign policy , ” a committee source said .
On Wednesday , the committee held a roundtable on the issue of how the global economic crisis affects U.S. foreign policy .
Last week , the committee assigned senators to head up regional subcommittees .
Among the new assignments , Sen. Robert Casey ( D - PA ) is heading up the subcommittee on Middle East and South Asia ; Sen. Jim Webb ( D - VA ) is heading the subcommittee on East Asia , a long - time passion of his ; and Sen. Barbara Boxer ( D - CA ) is heading up a new subcommittee on global women ’s issues , an interest of hers and of Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
Senator Casey , who is planning his subcommittee ’s first hearing on the recent violence in Sri Lanka Feb. 24 , envisions a robust agenda for the year , including hearings on Iran , Pakistan , Iraqi refugees , and the nuclear programs in the Gulf states .
“ We are going to be working very hard within the committee itself and within the subcommittee to take a hard look at a whole series of challenges we face in foreign affairs going forward , ” Casey told Foreign Policy .
Although he and the chairman are very supportive of the Obama administration ’s foreign - policy team , he said the committee also has to be an independent voice on foreign policy .
He especially wants to “ pay close attention to all of the areas under our subcommittee ’s jurisdiction , which are the subject of a lot of debate [ in the U.S. government ] and require a lot of vigilance , whether in Afghanistan , Pakistan , Iran , Iraq , [ or ] the Middle East . ”
Regarding Kerry ’s chairmanship of the committee , Casey said he was “ very excited .
He ’s an ideal successor ” to former SFRC chairman Joseph Biden .
It ’s no secret that in a city full of people who feel they do not have the first - choice job they deserve , Senator Kerry , who sought the presidency in 2004 and more recently lobbied to be Obama ’s secretary of state , has more reasons than many to be wistful .
But as the Obama administration grapples with the staggering economic crisis and continued global turmoil , Kerry appears to be putting any lingering resentments aside and getting to work .
Among Kerry ’s foreign relations committee staff are several people seeking administration positions , some still waiting for solid offers to materialize .
( The Cable recently reported that SFRC staffer Puneet Talwar will join the NSC as senior director on Iran , Iraq , and Gulf states , and that an advisor on European issues , Tomicah Tillemann , will go work as a speechwriter for Secretary Clinton .
Jennifer Simon is another committee staffer who recently left to go work at the U.S. - UN office at the State Department . )
Staffers still waiting to hear say Kerry has been very sympathetic to their situation , and while supporting their wish to go into the administration , has let it be known he would like them to stay .
“ He ’s been great , ” one staffer said .
“ However this all plays out , he ’s a really classy guy . ”

US “ Conservative Christian ” ( I find they ’re the worst kind ) investment group ( because Jesus loved the financial types )
The Timothy Plan have issued a list of games that responsible ( mental ) parents should avoid buying for their little angels ( future teenage parents ) this Christmas .
Included on the list are the usual suspects : GTA IV because it ’s just evil .
Devil May Cry 4 because , well , it ’s got the devil and stuff .
Saints Row 2 , presumably because it ’s too much fun and Bully because it makes you be a bit gay in school and religious types definitely do not like underage gayness unless it involves one of their own , in which case it ’s not great news but we ’ll just send you to work in an orphanage in Brazil and pretend it never happened .
A surprise inclusion on the list is Army of Two which has been condemned for featuring “ Somewhat homo - erotic undertones between the two main characters ” .
They should have just published its review scores .
So there you go , fundamentalist right wing hypocrites giving gaming advice to gullible parents .
On a related note I ’m going to burn all copies of The Bible that I can find because I had a quick flick through and there are quite a few references to prostitutes as well as a number of acts of violence , rape and genocide .
Two of the main male characters even kiss in a garden , but it ’s alright because one of them get ’s nailed to a cross for it .
Original source from Gamepolitics.com
P.S. You will notice that I did n’t link to The Timothy Plan in this article .
If you want to know more about them you can find them with google but you might have to turn your “ nutcase filter ” off to see it in your list of results .
I ran my own analysis of several of the algorithms in this thread and came up with some new results .
You can see those old results in the edit history of this answer , but they 're not accurate , as I made a mistake , and wasted time analyzing several algorithms which are n't close .
However , pulling lessons from several different answers , I now have two algorithms that crush the " winner " of this thread .
Here 's the core thing I do differently than everyone else :
//
This is faster because a number is divisible by 2^ 4 or more only 6 % of the time // and more than that a vanishingly small percentage .
while ( ( x & 0x3 ) == 0 ) x >>= 2 ; // This is effectively the same as the switch - case statement used in the original // answer . if (( x & 0x7 ) !=
1 ) return false ;
However , this simple line , which most of the time adds one or two very fast instructions , greatly simplifies the switch - case statement into one if statement .
However , it can add to the runtime if many of the tested numbers have significant power - of - two factors .
The algorithms below are as follows :
Internet - Kip 's posted answer
- Kip 's posted answer Durron - My modified answer using the one - pass answer as a base
- My modified answer using the one - pass answer as a base DurronTwo - My modified answer using the two - pass answer ( by @ JohnnyHeggheim ) , with some other slight modifications .
Here is a sample runtime if the numbers are generated using Math.abs ( java.util.Random.nextLong ( ) )
0 % Scenario{vm=java , trial=0 , benchmark =Internet} 39673.40 ns ; ?=378.78 ns @ 3 trials 33 % Scenario{vm=java , trial=0 , benchmark =Durron} 37785.75 ns ; ?=478.86 ns @ 10 trials 67 % Scenario{vm=java , trial=0 , benchmark =DurronTwo} 35978.10 ns ; ?=734.10 ns @ 10 trials benchmark us linear runtime Internet 39.7 ==============================
Durron 37.8 ============================
DurronTwo 36.0 =========================== vm : java trial : 0
And here is a sample runtime if it 's run on the first million longs only :
0 % Scenario{vm=java , trial=0 , benchmark =Internet} 2933380.84 ns ; ?=56939.84 ns @ 10 trials 33 % Scenario{vm=java , trial=0 , benchmark =Durron} 2243266.81 ns ; ?=50537.62 ns @ 10 trials 67 % Scenario{vm=java , trial=0 , benchmark=DurronTwo} 3159227.68 ns ; ?=10766.22 ns @ 3 trials benchmark ms linear runtime Internet 2.93 ===========================
Durron 2.24 =====================
DurronTwo 3.16 ============================== vm : java trial : 0
As you can see , DurronTwo does better for large inputs , because it gets to use the magic trick very very often , but gets clobbered compared to the first algorithm and Math. sqrt because the numbers are so much smaller .
Meanwhile , the simpler Durron is a huge winner because it never has to divide by 4 many many times in the first million numbers .
Here 's Durron :
public final static boolean isPerfectSquareDurron ( long n ) { if ( n < 0 ) return false ; if (n == 0 ) return true ; long x = n ; //
This is faster because a number is divisible by 16 only 6 % of the time // and more than that a vanishingly small percentage .
while ( ( x & 0x3 ) == 0 ) x >>= 2 ; // This is effectively the same as the switch - case statement used in the original // answer . if (( x & 0x7 ) == 1 ) { long sqrt ; if(x < 410881L ) { int i ; float x2 , y ; x2 = x * 0.5 F ; y = x ; i = Float.floatToRawIntBits(y ) ; i = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 ) ; y = Float.intBitsToFloat( i ) ; y = y * ( 1.5 F - ( x2 * y * y ) ) ; sqrt = ( long ) ( 1.0F /y ) ; } else { sqrt = ( long ) Math.sqrt( x ) ; } return sqrt*sqrt == x ; } return false ; }
And DurronTwo
public final static boolean isPerfectSquareDurronTwo ( long n) { if (n < 0 ) return false ; // Needed to prevent infinite loop if (n == 0 ) return true ; long x = n ; while ( ( x & 0x3 ) == 0 ) x >>= 2 ; if ( ( x & 0x7 ) == 1 ) { long sqrt ; if ( x < 41529141369L ) { int i ; float x2 , y ; x2 = x * 0.5 F ; y = x ; i = Float.floatToRawIntBits(y ) ; //using the magic number from // http://www.lomont.org/Math/Papers/2003/InvSqrt.pdf //since it more accurate i = 0x5f375a86 - ( i >> 1 ) ; y = Float.intBitsToFloat( i ) ; y = y * ( 1.5 F - ( x2 * y * y ) ) ; y = y * ( 1.5 F - ( x2 * y * y ) ) ; // Newton iteration , more accurate sqrt = ( long ) ( ( 1.0 F /y ) + 0.2 ) ; } else { // Carmack hack gives incorrect answer for n >= 41529141369 . sqrt = ( long ) Math.sqrt( x ) ; } return sqrt*sqrt == x ; } return false ; }
And my benchmark harness : ( Requires Google caliper 0.1-rc5 )
public class SquareRootBenchmark { public static class Benchmark1 extends SimpleBenchmark { private static final int ARRAY_SIZE = 10000 ; long [ ] trials = new long [ ARRAY_SIZE ] ; @ Override protected void setUp ( ) throws Exception { Random r = new Random ( ) ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < ARRAY_SIZE ; i++) { trials [ i ] = Math.abs(r.nextLong ( ) ) ; } } public int time Internet ( int reps ) { int trues = 0 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < reps ; i++) { for ( int j = 0 ; j < ARRAY_SIZE ; j++ ) { if ( SquareRootAlgs.isPerfectSquareInternet( trials[j ] ) ) trues ++ ; } } return trues ; } public int timeDurron ( int reps ) { int trues = 0 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < reps ; i++) { for ( int j = 0 ; j < ARRAY_SIZE ; j++ ) { if ( SquareRootAlgs.isPerfectSquareDurron( trials[j ] ) ) trues ++ ; } } return trues ; } public int timeDurron Two ( int reps ) { int trues = 0 ; for ( int i = 0 ; i < reps ; i++) { for ( int j = 0 ; j < ARRAY_SIZE ; j++ ) { if ( SquareRootAlgs.isPerfectSquareDurronTwo( trials[j ] ) ) trues ++ ; } } return trues ; } } public static void main ( String ... args ) { Runner.main ( Benchmark1.class , args ) ; } }
UPDATE : I 've made a new algorithm that is faster in some scenarios , slower in others , I 've gotten different benchmarks based on different inputs .
If we calculate modulo 0xFFFFFF = 3 x 3 x 5 x 7 x 13 x 17 x 241 , we can eliminate 97.82 % of numbers that can not be squares .
This can be ( sort of ) done in one line , with 5 bitwise operations :
if (!goodLookupSquares [( int ) ( ( n & 0xFFFFFFl ) + ( ( n >> 24 ) & 0xFFFFFFl ) + ( n >> 48 ) ) ] ) return false ;
The resulting index is either 1 ) the residue , 2 ) the residue + 0xFFFFFF , or 3 ) the residue + 0x1 FFFFFE .
Of course , we need to have a lookup table for residues modulo 0xFFFFFF , which is about a 3 mb file ( in this case stored as ascii text decimal numbers , not optimal but clearly improvable with a ByteBuffer and so forth .
But since that is precalculation it does n't matter so much .
You can find the file here ( or generate it yourself ) :
public final static boolean isPerfectSquareDurronThree ( long n) { if (n < 0 ) return false ; if (n == 0 ) return true ; long x = n ; while ( ( x & 0x3 ) == 0 ) x >>= 2 ; if ( ( x & 0x7 ) == 1 ) { if ( !goodLookupSquares [ ( int ) ( ( n & 0xFFFFFFl ) + ( ( n >> 24 ) & 0xFFFFFFl ) + ( n >> 48 ) ) ] ) return false ; long sqrt ; if(x < 410881L ) { int i ; float x2 , y ; x2 = x * 0.5 F ; y = x ; i = Float.floatToRawIntBits(y ) ; i = 0x5f3759df - ( i >> 1 ) ; y = Float.intBitsToFloat( i ) ; y = y * ( 1.5 F - ( x2 * y * y ) ) ; sqrt = ( long ) ( 1.0F /y ) ; } else { sqrt = ( long ) Math.sqrt( x ) ; } return sqrt*sqrt == x ; } return false ; }
I load it into a boolean array like this :
private static boolean [ ] goodLookupSquares = null ; public static void initGoodLookupSquares ( ) throws Exception { Scanner s = new Scanner ( new File ( " 24residues_squares.txt " ) ) ; goodLookupSquares = new boolean [ 0x1FFFFFE ] ; while ( s.hasNextLine ( ) ) { int residue = Integer.valueOf(s.nextLine ( ) ) ; goodLookupSquares [ residue ] = true ; goodLookupSquares [ residue + 0xFFFFFF ] = true ; goodLookupSquares [ residue + 0x1 FFFFFE ] = true ; } s.close ( ) ; }
Example runtime .
It beat Durron ( version one ) in every trial I ran .
More disturbingly , Onassis went on to speak freely about Bobby .
According to Hélène , Onassis 's hatred for him was still vivid and intense .
In the small hours , Onassis walked Helene to the beach from where a launch would take her back to the Christina .
They stood together , gazing out to sea , for a long time .
After a while , Hélène realised Onassis was talking to himself , in low , murmuring tones , like someone deep in prayer .
Finally , as she strained to hear what he was saying , he turned to her and , clearly and simply , said : ' You know , Hélène , I put up the money for Bobby Kennedy 's murder . '
intro by Chris Kane
One of the most common forms of sectarian socialism today is the myriad of Trotskyist organisations based on the model of undemocratic centralism .
They claim the origin of their ideas not so much in Marx but Leon Trotsky , one of the leaders of the Russian Revolution .
Trotsky came to be identified as one of the foremost opponents of Stalinism , but as opposed to bringing about a recomposition of the communist movement , Trotskyism compounded the crisis of Marxism .
The legacy of Trotsky today is one of constant fragmentation and sectarian vanguardism , whose adherents often cut themselves off from practical service to the labour movement by their antics .
How did this come about ?
The following critical analysis of Trotsky is by Raya Dunayevskaya , the American Marxist who originated in Ukraine .
In 1937 she moved to Mexico to work with Trotsky , serving as his Russian language secretary .
Her closeness to Trotsky did not prevent her questioning his ideas – she later wrote : “ Out of the Spanish Civil War there emerged a new kind of revolutionary who posed questions , not against Stalinism , but against Trotskyism , indeed against all established Marxists ” .
After the 1939 Hitler - Stalin
Pact she broke from Trotsky over his continued belief Stalin ’s USSR was a ‘ workers state ’ and developed a theory of state - capitalism .
Later she developed a Marxist Humanist current in the USA , supported by Harry McShane in Scotland .
One of her most important books was Philosophy and Revolution , published in 1973 which contains a powerful critique of Leon Trotsky as a theoretician – this is republished below .
Leon Trotsky as Theoretician , by Raya Dunayevskaya
“ In every dualistic system . . . the fundamental defect makes it­self visible in the inconsistency of unifying at one moment , what a moment before had been explained incapable of unification . ”
Hegel
The truth is always concrete , and nowhere more so than on the question of methodology , which becomes the ground of the inner coherence between philosophy and revolution .
Be­cause of the heroic mold of the former Commissar of War , the rigors of the exile to which Stalin consigned Trotsky soon after Lenin ’s death , and the calumnies that dogged his every step until the day of his murder at the hands of a NKVD assassin , there is a subjective air in much that has been written about Trotsky , and subjectivity is attributed to Trotsky himself .
Nothing is further from the truth .
Trotsky ’s analyses were objectively grounded .
It was not because of subjectivism , not because he was “ the Man of October ” ( as he was affec­tionately called by his adherents ) , that he persisted in his at­tachment to Russia .
Rather , he erred in the analysis of the class nature of the Soviet Union , continuing to call for its defense even after the Hitler - Stalin Pact for what to him were validly objective reasons .
Even as the NKVD assassin ’s pickaxe pierced his skull , Trotsky maintained that Russia was “ a workers ’ state , though degenerate . ”
The reduction of the very concept of socialism to statified property is grounded in a methodology that , long before it failed to see a transformation into its opposite in the state property form , had developed the theory of permanent revolu­tion without a self - developing Subject .
The dualism in Trots­kyism was thus not only bounded on the one hand by the concept of world revolution and , on the other hand , by workers ’ state = nationalized property , but had deeper roots in the very methodology of Trotsky ’s most original theory .
Put differently , underlying the universalization of the particular , nationalized property , was the dualism in Trotsky ’s practice of the dialectic .
Theory , original Marxist theory , is a hard taskmaster .
So inseparable is Marxist theory from reality and philosophy that no matter how brilliant the prognostication - and the 1905 prediction that the proletariat , before achieving power in any technologically advanced country , may come to power in backward Russia was surely such a brilliant prognostica­tion - it cannot substitute for what Hegel called “ the labor , the patience , the seriousness , and the suffering of the negative . ”
The span of 1904 to 1940 is surely long enough not only to test “ the suffering ” ( or lack of it ) of “ the negative , ” but what is a great deal more crucial , to see how theory measured up to reality .
The theory of permanent revolution was first propounded by Marx in his 1850 Address to the Communist League in which , in analyzing the failure of the 1848 revolu­tions , he stated that the proletariat must not stop at the point where it helps the bourgeoisie destroy feudalism , but the revolution must continue “ in permanence ” to the achievement of socialism .
When this statement was raised to the level of theory in the very different circumstances of the Russo - Japanese War , it v/as known as “ the theory of Parvus and Trotsky . ”
A. The Theory of Permanent Revolution
In 1904 , in a series of articles on the Russo - Japanese War entitled War and Revolution , Parvus had written :
“ The war has started over Manchuria and Korea ; but it has already grown into a conflict over leadership in East Asia .
At the next stage Russia ’s entire position in the world will be at stake ; and the war will end in a shift in the political balance of the world .
. . .
And the Russian Proletariat may well play the role of the vanguard of the socialist revolution . ”
In My Life , Trotsky , who was Parvus ’ junior by twelve years , readily enough admitted that the analysis of Parvus “ brought me closer to the problems of Social Revolution , and , for me , definitely transformed the conquest of power by the proletariat from an astronomical ‘ final ’ goal to the practical task of our day . ”
Nevertheless , it was Trotsky ’s 1905 , a series of articles written between 1904 and 1906 , climaxed by the theses in Summaries and Prospectives , which came out of the actual 1905 Revolution , that raised the prognosis to the level of theory .
It can rightly be considered original in this develop­ment .
The eighty - page essay on the vanguard role of the proletariat , the subordinate role of the peasantry , the question of “ state support of the European proletariat , ” and the interrelationship of Russia with the European Revolution became the subject of controversy long before Stalin charged Trotsky with “ underestimation of the peasantry . ”
Let us read the main theses as Trotsky himself wrote them :
“ In a country economically more backward the proletariat may come to power sooner than in a country capitalistically advanced .
. . .
Marxism is above all a method of analysis - not an analysis of texts , but an analysis of social rela­tions .
. . .
“ We have shown above that the objective premises of socialist revolution have already been created by the economic de­velopment of the advanced capitalist countries .
. . .
“ Many elements of the working masses , especially among the rural population , will be drawn into the revolution and for the first time obtain political organization only after the urban proletariat has taken the helm of government .
“ Without direct state support from the European proletariat the working class of Russia cannot remain in power and cannot convert its temporary rule into prolonged Socialist dictatorship .
. . .
On the other hand , there is no doubt that a socialist revolution in the West would allow us to turn the temporary supremacy of the working class directly into a Socialist dictatorship .
. . .
“ It is the purpose of every Socialist party to revolutionize the minds of the working class in the same way as development of capitalism has revolutionized social relations .
. . .
The colossal influence of the Russian revolution manifests itself in killing party routines , in destroying Socialist conservatism , in making a clean contest of proletarian forces against capitalist reaction a question of the day .
. . .
An Eastern revolution imbues the Western proletariat with revolutionary idealism and stimulates its desire to speak “ Russian ” to its foes . ”
These are the main theses of the famous theory of the permanent revolution as they were expounded in 1904 - 06 , and repeated over and over and over again for nearly thirty - five years , that is , throughout the rest of Trotsky ’s life .
Theoreti­cally , his whole life can be said to be a series of postscripts to these 1904 - 06 theses .
It is not without significance , how­ever , that Trotsky had never made the theory the foundation for building a tendency or a group ; that Trotsky himself did not propound the theory in 1917 .
The choice of theoretic weapon - the theory of permanent revolution - was Stalin ’s , not Trotsky ’s , though Trotsky eagerly rose to the bait from the very start of the struggle with Stalin .
The dispute was not over the stage of the world economy , nor over the law of combined development which made it possible for even a backward land like Russia to have a concentrated proletariat .
Neither was the vanguard role of the proletariat , nor its need for “ state aid ” from the techno­logically more advanced lands in dispute .
What was in dispute was the role of the masses , not because Lenip doubted the vanguard role of the proletariat and did not fear the private property instincts of the peasantry , but because he did not wish to foreclose the role of the peasant masses in the dialectics of an actual revolution .
Since , in the majority , the Russian population was peasant , Lenin considered that all talk of revolution that did not leave that question open was “ abstract , ” “ sonorous , ” “ empty . ”
Whatever Stalin ’s motivation in singling out “ the under­estimation of the peasantry ” - and it surely was for purposes of beating Trotsky and had nothing to do with Stalin ’s allegedly “ correct ” position - nevertheless , the truth was that Trotsky ’s concept of the peasantry was certainly not one of a self - developing Subject .
It is this which speaks a great deal louder than any Stalinist slander of him .
The concept of Subject is pivotal to the dialectic of revolution , not only in Russia but in China , not only in 1905 or 1917 but in 1927 and 1937 .
It defines the “ abstract revolutionism ” that Lenin considered the methodological enemy after conquest as before , in defeat as in victory .
That is why he tried sketching out new points of departure for theory , should the continuation of October on a world scale emerge “ via Peking rather than via Berlin . ”
And because this is central also to our age , we must follow , step by step , Trotsky ’s own views .
Trotsky would have us believe that his position on the peasantry flowed from his position on the vanguard role of the proletariat , but in truth , from the very start his conception of the proletariat ’s role was marred by the same abstractions that marred his conception of the peasantry .
The question was always one of the .
Marxist organization ’s having “ influence over the proletariat , ” “ leading ” them both before they gain state power and after , and later still , in order for socialism to become a “ world system . ”
The proletariat too he saw not as a self - developing Subject , but as force .
This came to a climax at the outbreak of World War I , which disclosed the shocking fact that established Marxism had betrayed the proletariat .
A new relationship of philosophy to revolution had to be worked out .
As we saw in the previous chapter , this need sent Lenin back to Hegel .
Trotsky felt no such compulsion .
It would , of course , be utterly ludicrous , the height of absurdity , to draw the conclusion that “ if only Trotsky had also re-examined Hegel ’s Logic , all would have gone well ” ; theoretical differences between Lenin and Trotsky would have been “ liquidated ” as Trotsky claimed 1917 had “ liquidated ” them .
Trotsky was not unmindful of the dialectic .
He took it for granted .
It remained “ inner , ” somewhere in the back of his head .
In the front field of politics , Trotsky had always been a revolutionary , an internationalist .
He had never shown a trace of “ national egoism , ” whether Russian or European .
Internationalism , however , was not the point at issue within the movement that had remained true to revolu­tionary Marxism .
What was at issue was the concrete working - out of a relationship of philosophy to revolution that would be the path to proletarian revolution .
If his 1905 theories had been the anticipation of 1917 , as the 1905 Revolution was “ the dress rehearsal ” for the 1917 Revolution , then the theory of permanent revolution should have gotten life and blood in the 1905 Revolution and in the period between 1905 and 1917 .
Thereby we would have become witness to its self - development , its anticipation of 1917 , its becoming ground for the type of antiwar struggles that led directly to socialist revolution .
Instead , Trotsky fought bitterly Lenin ’s slogan , “ Turn the imperialist war into civil war , ” as “ negative ” ; he limited himself to such “ positive ” slogans as “ Peace without annexa­tions . ”
Clearly , far from having confidence in the vanguard revolutionary role of the proletariat , Trotsky felt that the proletariat could not be expected to embark on anything more than “ a struggle for peace . ”
It is true that once 1917 burst on the historic scene , he claimed it “ proved ” his theory of permanent revolution .
But he hardly practiced such concepts in the period 1914 - 17 .
Indeed , he rejected the suggestion that the Zimmerwald antiwar call single out the name of Liebknecht , the only Socialist Deputy courageous enough to dare vote against granting war credits to the Kaiser , on the ground that that would be a “ personification , ” “ a particularization , ” a “ Germanizing ” of the “ universal struggle for peace ” !
Lenin , on the other hand , felt that every , every , every question - the proletariat as well as the peasantry , the “ Organizational Question ” as well as the struggle against war - had to have its dialectic worked out anew .
Trotsky held on to the old concepts .
Indeed , on the peasant question nothing seemed to change from 1904 , when he stated that “ the rural population will obtain political organization only after the urban proletariat has taken the helm of government . ”
In 1909 Trotsky wrote that local cretinism is the historical curse of the peasant movement :
It was on the circumscribed political intelligence of the peasant who , while in his village , plundered his landlord in order to seize his land , but then , decked out in a soldier ’s coat , shot down the workers , that the first wave of the Russian Revolution [ 1905 ] broke .
Even when 1917 erupted not only in the cities but in the countryside , Trotsky , in the very same breath in which he stated that the peasants “ pushed the Bolsheviks toward power with their revolt , ” concluded that they had played a revolu­tionary role “ for the last time in their history . ”
Despite Trotsky ’s claim that on the agrarian question he was “ the pupil ” and Lenin was the “ teacher ” ; despite the actual role of the peasantry in 1917 , which he himself ex­pressed as , “ they pushed the Bolsheviks toward power with their revolt ” ; despite the fact that the history of China , which was the country at issue in 1925 - 27 , is one long series of peasant revolts , Trotsky reverts so totally to the 1905 position that he does not even grant the peasant a national , much less a socialist , consciousness : “ Agrarian backwardness always goes hand in hand with the absence of roads . . . and the absence of national consciousness . ”
Mao ’s on - the - spot report of the revolutionary role of the peasantry - the now famous Hunan report - did not exist for Trotsky .
Even if we allow for the fact that he may not have known of its existence because he was increasingly isolated from the inner sanctums of the leadership , still , as late as 1938 - when Mao Tse - tung was very much centre front on the historic stage , having re-entered the national scene through a new alignment with Chiang Kai - shek to fight against the Japanese invasion - Trotsky still laughed at Mao ’s claims of having established “ peasant Soviets . ”
Trotsky again re­iterated :
“ the peasantry , the largest numerically and the most atomized , backward and oppressed class is capable of local uprisings and partisan warfare but requires the leadership of a more advanced and centralized class in order for this struggle to be elevated to an all - national level . ”
Trotsky ’s words speak louder than any of Stalin ’s allega­tions about “ underestimation of the peasantry . ”
Moreover , ten years after the Stalin - Trotsky controversy , precisely when Trotsky is introducing a new work on the Chinese Revolution ( Harold Isaacs ’ The Tragedy of the Chinese Revolution ) , he repeats his old position on the peasantry , nevertheless making the bold claim : “ the conception of the permanent revolution was confirmed once more , this time not in the form of a vic­tory , but of a catastrophe . ”
No matter what the historical period , no matter which country is the topic , no .
matter what the world situation , Trotsky holds to his position that “ no matter how revolutionary the role of the peasantry may be , it can , nevertheless , not be an independent role and even less a leading one . ”
The real division , then , was not between Trotsky and | Stalin but between Trotsky and Lenin . )
This manifested itself 1 “ most strongly in their attitudes toward the masses , peasant or proletarian .
Are they the makers of history , or are they there only “ to be led , ” to be ordered about ?
Are they the forces who , even when they overthrow capitalism , must return to the role of passive masses the day after the revolution ?
To Lenin , the revolutionary role of the peasantry was not something he left behind with the April ( 1917 ) Thesis , in which he declared that the slogan of “ democratic dictatorship of the proletariat and peasantry ” had outlived itself , that from then on the struggle was to be for the dictatorship of the proletariat .
On the contrary , after the proletariat won power , Lenin insisted that until the revolution enveloped the country­side and the poor peasants ’ land committees held destiny in their hands , the revolution would not have completed itself .
Lenin ’s methodology was always that of looking at the masses - proletariat , peasant , or oppressed nationality - as self - developing Subject .
In the dark clays of World War I , when workers were slaughtering each other across national boundary lines , he looked to the struggle of small nations for self - determination :
“ The Dialectics of history is such that small nations , power­less as an independent factor in the struggle against imperial­ism , play a part as one of the ferments , one of the bacilli which help the real power against imperialism to come on the scene , namely , the socialist proletariat . ”
In opposition to many a Bolshevik co-leader , Lenin did not believe the success of the Russian Revolution meant that self - determination was no longer applicable .
Stalin’s “ rude­ness ” and “ disloyalty ” during Lenin ’s lifetime were to be seen precisely in his Great Russian chauvinist attitude toward the national minorities , the Georgians especially .
As Lenin lay dying , he entrusted the struggle against Stalin on the question of national minorities to the hands of Trotsky .
But as was characteristic of Trotsky throughout his life , he once again went in for “ conciliationism . ”
He failed to unfurl the banner of struggle against Stalin at the Twelfth Congress of the Russian Party as he had promised Lenin he would do .
In 1920 he had voted for Lenin ’s Theses on the National and Colonial Question .
But again , as on the whole question of dialectics , Trotsky merely “ took it for granted ” without ever redeveloping the universals of socialism with the newly de­veloping objective situation , much less a new role for the peasantry .
The one and only time Trotsky gave serious consideration to the fact that the Theses established a new point of departure in theory , a new point on the basis not of the theory of permanent revolution but of the Leninist position on the National Question , was the time when he was forced to do so by the exigencies of a united caucus with Zinoviev against Stalin ’s fatal class - collaborationist policy in China .
But then it was Zinoviev ’s Thesis he was defending .
That thesis based itself directly on Lenin ’s position .
The nub of the question is not the authorship of any thesis .
Lenin felt a new departure in theory was called for because a new “ Subject ” had come out in life .
The “ Subject ” - self - determination of nations - may have appeared old .
It was during the war and even after the success of the Russian Revolution that it had an altogether different meaning .
“ Can we recognize as correct the assertion that the capitalist stage of development of national economy is inevitable for those backward nations which are now liberating them­selves . . . ?
We must reply to this question in the negative … we must . . . give theoretical grounds for the proposition that , with the aid of the proletariat of the most advanced countries , the backward countries may pass to the Soviet , and after passing through a definite stage of development , to Com­munism , without passing through the capitalist stage of development . ”
It can not be stressed too much that these precedent - shaking statements came from a man who had spent decades fighting the Narodniki ( Populists ) of his own country , people who had maintained that Russia could skip the capitalist stage of development .
Just as Nehru thought that through the Panchyat ( village council ) , India could go directly to socialism , so the Narodniki thought Russia could do that through the mir .
Lenin fought them bitterly and won the theoretical debate .
History has certainly upheld his judgment .
Only something very fundamental and objective could have wrought such a complete change in Lenin ’s concepts .
Three world shaking events brought about this transformation .
First , the 1917 Russian Revolution had established a workers ’ state that could come to the aid of a land even more back­ward technologically than Russia .
Second , the colonial revolu­tions themselves illuminated the revolutionary role not only of the peasantry but also of national struggles in the imperialist epoch .
Third , there was the new dimension of color in the Orient , in Africa , and within the United States .
As a totality these events concretized the Subject .
It was this knowledge of the present stage of the im­perialist development of capitalism and the specific stage of national revolutions that had impelled Lenin , ever since the Irish rising of Easter Week 1916 , to stress that not all initiative at all times comes only from the working class .
As we saw , to Lenin the success of the Russian Revolution did not mean that self - determination was no longer applicable .
The Revo­lution only underlined the truth of history ’s dialectic : just as small nations fighting for independence could unleash the socialist revolution , so the working class of industrialized countries achieving revolution could help the underdeveloped countries avoid capitalist industrialization .
This point of departure in theory - industrialization without capitalism - rested , of course , on the proposition that the working class of the advanced countries could and would come to the aid of their brothers in the technologically underdeveloped coun­tries .
As we see , this page of Comintern history was lost , not only by Stalin , whose policy ruined the Chinese Revolution of 1925 - 27 , but by Trotsky .
It was lost by Trotsky not out of “ subjectivism ” or “ misquotation . ”
No , the reason goes much , much deeper .
That is how he read Lenin .
That is what he understood by the dialectics of revolution , the vanguard role of the proletariat .
It turned out always to be “ object . ”
He did not make a theory out of this as had Bukharin , a theory Stalin practiced .
But once Lenin was not there to do the “ correcting , ” the next step was to reduce the concept of a workers ’ state to nationalized property .
The failure to have a new appreciation of the dialectic on the basis of the new reality wrought no havoc so long as Lenin was alive and the spontaneity of the masses brought suc­cess to the Russian Revolution .
But after Lenin ’s death , capi­talism once again caught its breath with the defeat of the developing European revolutions ; it gained a new lease on life with retrogressive development also in Russia ; and no new “ reading ” of the dialectic helped single out the new trans­formations into opposite and their opposite - new revolution­ary forces within the proletariat , the peasantry , the youth .
Thereupon the dialectic took its toll .
Trotskyism , now the only beacon against Stalinist totalitarianism and yet tail - ending it , helped disorient a new generation of revolutionaries .
The last decade of Trotsky ’s life discloses that tragedy .
B. The Nature of the Russian Economy , or Making a Fixed Particular into a New Universal
Each generation of Marxists must restate Marxism for itself , and the proof of its Marxism lies not so much in its “ originality ” as in its “ actuality ” ; that is , whether it meets the chal­lenge of the new times .
* Thus Trotsky asserted that no matter how great his role in 1917 , the proof of his stature would depend on his achievements after the death of Lenin .
Stalin ’s victory over Trotsky would mean nothing if it were Trotsky ’s analyses which proved correct and thereby laid the foundation for the continuity of world revolution .
That is , of course , true , and it is here where we can trace the different methodo­logical approaches of Lenin and Trotsky .
Lenin , as we saw , met the challenge of the new objective situation of monopoly capitalism and imperialism philo­sophically as well as “ materialistically ” by studying it dialectically .
He looked at the objective and subjective situation as a unit , a totality that contained its own opposite , from which contradiction the impulse to forward movement would emerge .
On the other hand , when confronted with a new stage of world capitalism and the startling phenomenon of Stalinism - not just Stalin as a personality whom Lenin judged so “ rude and disloyal ” that his Will asked that Stalin be “ removed , ” but Stalinism , the Russian name for a monolithic party armed with state and economic power - Trotsky merely reasserted the old duality between theory and practice in a new form : his concept of world revolution versus Stalin ’s “ theory ” of “ socialism in one country . ”
So long as no new stage of economic development had matured sufficiently to be able to suck in the many centrifugal tendencies within the Bolshevik Party , those could , perhaps with justification , appear to be based only on political dif­ferences .
By 1928 , however , it was no longer a question of factional fights or even only of the receding revolutionary wave .
It was internal .
The NEP man had grown rich and threatened the workers ’ state so totally that Stalin had to break with Bukharin ’s “ socialism at snail ’s pace ” and hurry to adopt “ sans authorization ” total state planning .
By the end of the first Five - Year Plan in 1932 , it had be­come quite clear that the whole world of private capitalism had collapsed .
The Depression had so undermined the founda­tions of “ private enterprise , ” thrown so many millions into the unemployed army , that workers , employed and unemployed , threatened the very existence of capitalism .
Capitalism , as it had existed - anarchic , competitive , exploitative , and a failure - had to give way to state planning to save itself from proletarian revolution .
Whether it was in rich countries like the United States that could still , with its New Deal , maintain a mixed economy , or in Nazi Germany with its state plan , or militarist Japan with its coprosperity sphere statification , the whole world had definitely moved from a “ simple ” monopoly stage lo something new .
What was it ?
Some , like Bruno Rizzi , called it “ Bureaucratic Collectivism ” ; others called it “ State - Capitalism . ”
None , it is true , worked out theories on the basis of a rigorous study of the Russian economy .
Trotsky rejected , out of hand , both designations .
The “ property forms ” were by now all limited to statification , for the early production conferences had not only been abolished , hut the trade unions themselves had been incorporated in the state .
Yet to him , property forms were what made Stalinist Russia inviolate as a workers ’ state , “ though degenerate . ”
The Stalinist feature of the bureaucracy was purely limited to its being a “ policeman ” arrogating to himself a greater share of the wealth as a result of his “ distributive function . ”
Though such a concentration on distribution had been repudiated by Marx as under - consumptionism , Trotsky used precisely this methodology .
He continued to consider Russia a workers ’ state , no matter how badly the workers fared in it ; no matter that the leadership was a bureaucracy with “ Cain Stalin ” - his term - at its head ; no matter that foreign policy included a Hitler pact ; and no matter that the Moscow Frame - Up Trials killed off the “ General Staff of the Revolution . ”
As Trotsky lay dying , the heritage he left his cadre - the Fourth International - was still “ Defense of the Soviet Union . ”
What methodology led to such a conclusion ?
Here are his own words :
“ The first concentration of the means of production in the hands of the state to occur in history was achieved by the proletariat with the method of social revolution , and not by capitalists with the method of trustification . ”
Where Lenin had fought hard against transforming the reality of the early workers ’ state into an abstraction which hid the bureaucratic deformations , Trotsky continued making an abstraction of the Russian state , even after Stalinism had transformed it into its opposite , a state - capitalist society .
Where Lenin warned that a workers ’ state was a transitional state , that it could be transitional “ either to socialism or a return backwards to capitalism , ” Trotsky limited any warning about a possible restoration of capitalism “ on the installment plan ” to the restoration of private capitalism .
Neither the fact that the workers had lost all their control over production through factory conferences , nor the fact that the trade unions themselves had been incorporated into the state apparatus , nor the fact that the means of production were increasing at the expense of the means of consumption , exactly as under private capitalism , would move him from making statified property into a fetish : nationalized property = workers ’ state .
Like all fetishisms , the fetishism of state property hid from Trotsky the course of the counter - revolution in the relations of production .
The , Stalinist Constitution , which legitimatized the counter - revolution against October , Trotsky viewed merely as something that first “ creates the political premise for the birth of a new possessing class . ”
As if classes were born from political premises !
The macabre Kremlin purges only proved to Trotsky that “ Soviet society organically tends toward the ejection of the bureaucracy ” !
Because to him Stalinist Russia was still a workers ’ state , he thought that the Moscow Trials weakened Stalinism .
Actually , they consolidated its rule and prepared it for “ the great Patriotic War ” - World War II .
Trotsky would speak of the possibility of a restoration of the possibility of restoration of capitalist relations , but it was always something that might happen or would happen , not as a process evolving “ before our very eyes , ” 17 evolving in the startling but not altogether mm foreseen form of state - capitalism .
The movement from monopoly to state - capitalism was , moreover , a world phe­nomenon .
Trotsky denied the fact .
He rejected the theory .
The struggle against Stalinism had an air of self - defense , however , not because Trotsky was subjective about his own m( a ( us as leader of the Russian Revolution , but because objecively he saw nothing fundamentally new in world capitalist development .
It had simply become more decadent and in its “ death agony ” had emitted fascism .
Though “ politically ” Stalin had become as evil , this had not “ fundamentally ” changed the economic relations in Russia ; nationalized prop­erly remained intact .
Nothing had changed for Trotsky since the decade of 1914 - 24 - except the leadership .
Stalin was the “ organizer of defeats ” - and he , Trotsky , could organize victories .
This is not meant sarcastically .
Trotsky certainly was a leader of the only victorious proletarian revolution in history .
Whether as Chairman of the Military Revolutionary Commit - lee , which had planned the actual insurrection , as builder of a Red Army out of raw peasant recruits who withstood all counter - revolutionary attacks from Tsarist generals and other professionals , as Commissar of War , or as Foreign Minister , history will not deny him his victories .
But that is not the mark of a Marxist theoretician .
To a revolutionary theoretician , what is important is that the new stage of economic development , no matter what it is called , is always considered in strict relationship to the subjective de­velopment , the new form of workers ’ revolt , i.e. , the new strata in the population that continue to oppose that stage of capitalistic development .
And flowing from this relation­ship comes the working out of a new relationship between theory and practice in a way that the philosophy of revolution and its forces and passions do not get separated .
Because these factors did not dominate Trotsky ’s analysis , his criticism of Stalinism , though constant , revolved mainly about bureaucratism and the adventuristic “ tempo ” of Stalinist industrialization .
Thereby he became prisoner of - the Stalinist Plan , even as classical political economists had remained prisoners of the fetishism of commodities although they dis­covered labor as the source of all value .
No wonder that , in the process , the very concept of socialism was reduced to the concept of state property , state plan .
Trotsky ’s denials not­withstanding , the proof of this is in Trotsky ’s own words - in nothing less fundamental than the Manifesto of the Fourth International on “ Imperialist War and Proletarian Revolu­tion ” :
To turn one ’s back on the nationalization of the means of production on the ground that , in and of itself , it does not create the well - being of the masses , is tantamount to sentenc­ing the granite foundation to destruction on the ground that it is impossible to live without walls and a roof .
The “ Man of October ” could not have fallen any deeper into the mire of the ideas and methodology of the Russian bureaucracy which was presenting , instead of theory , an ad­ministrative formula for minimum costs and maximum pro­duction - the true gods of all class rulers .
Because Trotsky saw no fundamental class division involved in the struggle against Stalinism , the struggle necessarily was reduced to the question of leadership .
When Trotsky was first exiled , he reduced the question of revolutionary methodology to the question of intuition :
No great work is possible without intuition - that is , without that subconscious sense which , although it may be developed and enriched by theoretical and practical work , must be ingrained in the very nature of the individual .
Neither theoretical education nor practical routine can replace the political insight which enables one to apprehend a situation , weight it as a whole , and foresee the future .
The gift takes on decisive importance at a time of abrupt changes and breaks - the conditions of revolution .
The events of 1905 revealed in me , I believe , this later life .
Toward the end of the 1930s the dualism between the theory of world revolution and the practice of defending “ socialism in one country , ” as if indeed it were a socialist creed , brought about a myriad of other contradictions .
Because Trotsky ’s analysis of the nature of Stalinism lacked a class « li;iracter , Stalin ’s “ theory of socialism in one country ” was treated as a new form of reformism , to be fought as such :
“ The theory of Stalin - Bukharin tears also the national revolution from the international path .
The present policy of the Com­munist International , its regime and the selection of its lead­ing personnel , correspond entirely to the debasement of the Communist International to an auxiliary corps which is not destined to solve independent tasks . ”
Failing to recognize a new stage of world economy and failing to see the class transformation within Russia , he naturally did not see the Stalinists as aspirants for world power .
The Hitler - Stalin in pact did nothing to change Trotsky ’s concept that the Communist Parties in World War II would do what the Social Democrats had done in World War I , each party capitulating to its own national bourgeoisie .
Then the Fourth International would expose the betrayers , and win to its side the proletariat , which remained “ immature . ”
This after the Spanish Revolution !
No wonder the Fourth International is a stillbirth .
C. Leadership , Leadership
Trotsky has written much of Lenin ’s “ rearming ” the Bolshevik Party after April 1917 which made possible the conquest of power in November .
He never had a word to say on Lenin ’s philosophic break with himself .
In any case , the point at issue here is not Lenin ’s “ rearming ” of the Party , which by innuendo had been made to appear as if it were a “ going over ” to Trotsky ’s theory of permanent revolution .
The point we are concerned with is that Trotsky had not “ rearmed ” himself , had nowhere undertaken any philosophic reorganization of his thinking when he was confronted with the betrayal either of the Second International in 1914 , or of the Third in the mid-1950s , when he finally did call for the creation of a new , Fourth International .
He did , however , realize full well that now the responsibility for the continuity of Marxism rested on his shoulders .
Here is how he expressed it in 1935 in his Diary :
“ After his [ Rakovsky ’s ] capitulation there is nobody left . . . and still I think that the work which I am engaged in now , despite its insufficient and fragmentary nature , is the most important work in my life .
More important than that of 1917 .
More important than the period of the Civil War , or any other .
“ For the sake of clarity I would put it this way : Had I not been present in 1917 in St. Petersburg , the October Revolu­tion would have taken place on the condition that Lenin was present and in command .
The same can , by and large , be said of the civil war period .
. . .
Thus I cannot speak of the indispensability of my work even about the period from 1917 - 21 .
“ But now my work is indispensable in the full sense of the word .
There is no arrogance in this claim at all .
The col­lapse of the two Internationals has posed a problem which none of the leaders of these Internationals is at all equipped to solve .
The vicissitudes of my fate has armed me with important experience in dealing with it .
There is now no one except the 2nd and 3rd Internationals .
I need at least five years of uninterrupted work to ensure the succession . ”
If only Trotsky had developed a theory to measure up to iik challenge of the times , even if the cadre did not !
Trotsky was always too preoccupied with the question of leadership .
This preoccupation stemmed from his subordination of the self - developing “ Subject ” to his concentration on leadership .
This led him not only to raise the question of leadership to the level of theory , but to attribute that to Lenin !
For Lenin ’s slogans to find their way to the masses there had to exist cadres . . . the vital mainspring in this process is the party , just as the vital mainspring in the mechanism of the party is its leadership .
This is precisely what the vital mainspring of Lenin ’s philosophy was not .
Despite his 1903 concept of vanguard party , Lenin in 1905 declared the proletariat in advance of the party .
Despite his leadership of the Bolshevik Party in 1917 , he threatened “ to go to the sailors ” when its leaders failed to put the question of workers ’ power on the agenda of the day .
By 1920 he proposed going to “ the non-party masses . ”
Despite the “ twenty - one conditions ” to the newly formed CI , he not only declared that the resolution was too intent on “ speaking Russian , ” but ended his life ’s work with the most devastating critique of his own co-leaders .
The Will not only made clear he had no one to leave his mantle to , but stated that if the divisions in the Political Bureau signified class divisions , then nothing he said would prevent its collapse .
Nothing did .
Trotsky , on the other hand , continued to speak of the ‘ immaturity ” of the proletariat :
“ The strategic task of the next period - a pre-revolutionary period of agitation , propaganda and organization - consists in overcoming contradictions between the immaturity of the proletariat and its vanguard .
. . . ”
Under the circumstances , his “ appeals to the world prole­tariat ” sounded hollow , remained abstractions .
Without a basis in a self - developing , creative Subject , the Fourth Inter­national could only be stillborn .
All the world ’s problems had been reduced to a question of leadership , as the very first sentence of the Fourth International testifies :
“ The world political situation as a whole is chiefly characterized by a historical crisis of the leadership of the proletariat . ”
Marxists are fond of saying that abstractions help only ‘ the enemy .
The abstraction “ nationalized property = workers ’ state ” has most certainly helped the enemy , the Stalinist counter - revolution , once it obtained the objective basis for being - Russia ’s statified , exploitative economy .
The duality between the concept of world revolution and that of defense of Stalinist Russia ; between socialism as a classless society that can only realize itself as a world society , and socialism = nationalized property isolated from the world economy ; between workers as the vanguard and workers who need to submit to “ the militarization of labor ” ( ! ) ; between Party as leader of the proletarian revolution and Party as rul­ing over workers ’ own instincts and demands - all these duali­ties , as we have seen , were compounded by the contradiction between the dialectics of the revolution and the specific Sub­ject who constituted the majority of “ the masses , ” when they happened to be peasant rather than proletarian .
It is time to draw the theoretic threads together as philosophy and revolution .
Just as that “ fixed particular , ” state property , was substituted for any concretization of the universal , socialism , so the determination of what was new in China in 1937 was buried in the old category , “ a bloc of four classes . ”
Mao was only echoing in 1925 - 27 Stalin ’s class - collaborationist view .
Mao ’s new offer of collaboration with Chiang Kai - shek did flow from the concept of a bloc of four classes .
But China in 1937 was not China 1927 , not only because the Chinese Com­munist Party , Stalinist or otherwise , was now a mass force , but above all because of the objective world situation created by Japan ’s invasion of China .
For Trotsky to treat the situation in China under those circumstances as if it were only a ii play of the 1925 - 27 disaster is not only to credit Stalin with omnipotence , it is to reveal one ’s own European outlook .
And that is very central to the whole thesis : Trotsky ’s outlook ” is too Europe - centred .
This is not to say that Trotsky was not a true interna­tionalist .
He had always been a world revolutionary .
He had never bowed to national egotism , Russian or European .
Indeed , the question is not a geographic question at all - neither European nor Oriental nor , for that matter , so much a world Question , as a question of what is a self - developing Subject .
Thus , “ Europe - cantered ” is used here as a manifestation of the failure to grasp a new self - developing Subject that in this case turned out to be the Chinese masses , mainly peas­ants .
What is needed is to hold tightly to the methodology of Marx , who likewise was , of necessity , Europe - centred , in where he lived , the historic period in which he lived , and the subject matter of his most serious theoretic studies , which was England in the mid-nineteenth century .
This did not , however , stop him from hailing the Taiping Revolution M a possible new point of departure in world develop­ment .
On the contrary , Marx held to this new point of development , not only in the 1850s , when it could be consisted to the quiescent 1850s of the European proletariat , but also in the 1870s and ’ 80s , when he began to study Russia , a country he had hitherto treated as the greatest European barbarism and as semi-Oriental .
Then , in his correspondences with Russian revolutionaries , he began to open altogether new possibilities of revolution in backward Russia , provided it would be supported by the European proletariat .
The same attitude to the concrete working out of the dialectic s of liberation characterized Marx ’s writings on the historic of the Oriental commune , despotic or otherwise .
The question of “ understanding the dialectics ” was not ever for Marx or Lenin merely the understanding of a philosophic category , but the question of working out the actual dialectic of liberation .
Every Marxist naturally aims at that , but there is no immediate one - to - one relationship between the subjective and the objective , between philosophy and revolution .
Since the test can come only in life itself , we looked at one actual reality , the period between Lenin ’s death and Trotsky ’s death , to examine the relationship of political theories and philos­ophic concepts .
If the dualism in Trotsky had nothing to do with any failure “ to return ” to Hegelian dialectics during the first Great Divide in Marxism in 1914 , it did have everything to do with abstract revolutionism , the methodological enemy Lenin singled out when he moved from attacks on the betrayers to criticism of his Bolshevik co-leaders , who by 1917 - 24 included Trotsky .
Notwithstanding the myriad concrete ac­tivities of Trotsky and Bukharin , as individuals and great revolutionaries , the simple and hard truth is that : “ I re­peatedly returned to the development and the grounding theory of the permanent revolution . . . the peasantry is utterly incapable of an independent political role . ”
This is one of the last theoretic writings we have from Trotsky , as World War II broke out upon a world changed by the Depression , the rise of fascism , the sprouting of state plans not only in the “ workers ’ state , ” but in the private capitalist world of Nazism and Japanese militarism and in the national resistance in China to Japan ’s invasion as well .
A theory so far removed from the realities of the age of imperialism and state - capitalism had to collapse of its own hollowness .
That present - day Trotskyist epigones can swear by Trotsky ’s theory of permanent revolution and by Mao ’s “ Communes ” only shows that weightless abstractions and an administrative mentality would rather hold on to a state - power than entrust everything to the elemental mass revolt .
Dialectics takes its own toll of theory and theoreticians .
Mr. Roubini ’s numbers may be the highest , but many others share his rising sense of alarm .
Simon Johnson , a former chief economist at the International Monetary Fund , estimates that the United States banks have a capital shortage of $ 500 billion .
“ In a more severe recession , it will take $ 1 trillion or so to properly capitalize the banks , ” said Mr. Johnson , an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
At the end of January , the I.M.F. raised its estimate of the potential losses from loans and other credit securities originated in the United States to $ 2.2 trillion , up from $ 1.4 trillion last October .
Over the next two years , the I.M.F. estimated , United States and European banks would need at least $ 500 billion in new capital , a figure more conservative than those of many economists .
Still , these numbers are all based on estimates of the value of complex mortgage - backed securities in a very uncertain economy .
“ At this moment , the liabilities they have far exceed their assets , ” said Mr. Posen of the Peterson institute .
“ They are insolvent . ”
Yet , as Mr. Posen and other economists note , there are crucial issues of timing and market psychology that surround the discussion of bank solvency .
If one assumes that current conditions reflect a temporary panic , then the value of the banks ’ distressed assets could well recover over time .
If not , many banks may be permanently impaired .
“ We wo n’t know what the losses are on these mortgage - backed securities , and we wo n’t until the housing market stabilizes , ” said Richard Portes , an economist at the London Business School .
Raghuram G. Rajan , a professor of finance and an economist at the University of Chicago graduate business school , draws the distinction between “ liquidation values ” and those of calmer times , or “ going concern values . ”
In a troubled time for banks , Mr. Rajan said , analysts are constantly scrutinizing current and potential losses at the banks , but that is not the norm .
“ If they had to sell these securities today , the losses would be far beyond their capital at this point , ” he said .
“ But if the prices of these assets will recover over the next year or so , if they do n’t have to sell at distress prices , the banks could have a new lease on life by giving them some time . ”
Salman Rushdie Complains About the Academy Awards , Calls " Slumdog Millionaire " Trivial Bullshit
Sir Salman Rushdie delivered a speech at Emory University yesterday , in which he complained about modern movie adaptations of books .
Although he also criticized " Benjamin Button " and " The Reader , " he was mainly pissed off by the film " Slumdog Millionaire , " because he said it has narrative problems that make it more of a fairy tale than a piece of modern narrative craft .
According to Rushdie , the movie has a plot spun out of candyfloss and cheap tricks : the sort of thing that newspapers call " touching " and " human " ...... but which merely spraypaint a melodramatic sheen on deeply - ingrained colonial prejudice .
"
The problem with this adaptation begins with the work being adapted , " he said , claiming that the movie " piles impossibility on impossibility .
" I saw this flick with my pal Bill Chapters one evening while we were both lonely and bored .
After it was done , we both wondered the same thing : " can you really still write stories in this day and age where women characters have no agency and are basically princesses who are trapped in castles waiting to be rescued ?
" I mean , can you ?
The female lead is rescued from her life of prostitution by a strong male with a big gun two separate times in this movie , suggesting that -- unless protected by the violent raw power of male symbols -- a woman will naturally drift into prostitution .
Which may be true , but if so , it should be explicitly explored and not merely magically facted .
And after the main character 's miraculous " Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? " victory , would n't he have a sudden , crippling existential breakdown and end up in a mental institution ?
Would n't it be awful to know for certain that there is a God and that He is a hack writer ?
Djinns , guns , sluts , poverty , and trivia !
And at the end , everybody dances !
Last Thursday , nine pirates were captured off the coast of Somalia .
Aiding in the capture were drones flown from the USS Mahan .
The drones fly overhead and take photos , which are instantly relayed to the ship .
Some of the drones are equipped with night vision , allowing them to take photographs at night of the pirates .
Rocket propelled grenades and automatic weapons were found on board the pirates skiff .
No word on what kind of drones the Navy was actually using to help capture the pirates .

Coworkers , sans Cubicles
Green Brooklyn ’s post about a new place called Treehouse reminded me of my fascination with the concept of coworking .
According to trusty Wikipedia :
Coworking is an emerging trend for a new pattern for working .
Typically work - at - home professionals or independent contractors or people who travel frequently end up working in relative isolation .
Coworking is the social gathering of a group of people , who are still working independently , but who share values and who are interested in the synergy that can happen from working with talented people in the same space .
After perusing some coworking spaces ’ websites , I was skeptical about the vague mentions of “ shared values ” that coworking community members claim to have .
Before joining , how are you supposed to know what those “ values ” are going to be and whether you ’d share them ?
But then I thought about who would join a coworking community , and realized that the claim of “ shared values ” makes sense to an extent — coworking appeals to people who have an entrepreneurial , independent spirit but are interested in sharing resources with others .
People who want coworkers but no cubicles .
I was n’t surprised to uncover a number of coworking spaces around New York City where various graphic designers , programmers , writers , editors , activists , and other freelancers , entrepreneurs , and telecommuters gather : New Work City in SoHo , Coworking Brooklyn in Williamsburg , Ditmas Workspace in Ditmas Park .
There are even official work meetings ( for people who do n’t officially work together ! ) such as Jelly .
Some coworking spaces have taken the idea of “ shared values ” a little bit further .
Treehouse and Green Spaces , located in the same building in Downtown Brooklyn , are committed to environmental sustainability — both in running their facilities and in the work that their members are engaged in .
Treehouse is geared toward designers who care about environmental issues , and Green Spaces serves as an incubator for new green businesses .
Canada 's telecoms regulator , the Canadian Radio - television and Telecommunications Commission ( CRTC ) is in the midst of a network neutrality proceeding , and the responses that rolled in this week were vociferous .
Several ISPs and music groups objected to any such rules , arguing that they might stop ISPs from implementing all sorts of wonderful policies such as P2P upload throttling , website blocking , and graduated response rules .
One of the more interesting responses came from an ISP called Videotron , which told the CRTC that controlling access to content " peut �tre b�n�fique non seulement pour les utilisateurs de services Internet mais pour la soci�t� en g�n�ral " — that is , " could be beneficial not only to users of Internet services but to society in general . "
As examples of such benefits , Videotron mentioned the control of spam , viruses , and child pornography .
It went on to suggest that graduated response rules — kicking users off the ' Net after several accusations of copyright infringement — could also be included as a benefit to society in general .
Canadian law professor Michael Geist is astonished at the comments .
The " submission achieves a remarkable combination , " he says , " arguing against net neutrality and for a three strikes approach that would terminate its own subscribers .
That any ISP could demonstrate such hostility toward its own customers provides a clear indicator of the utter lack of broadband competition in Canada and serves as a warning that the New Zealand fight could eventually make its way here . "
The Canadian Independent Record Production Association ( CIRPA ) was n't as concerned with benefits to society as it was about making sure indie artists in Canada could earn a living .
One good way to do that , it suggested , might be to just flat - out block access to P2P sites like The Pirate Bay — a practice that certain kinds of neutrality rules might prevent .
" Certainly policies that limit the consumers access to P2P sites that distribute large volumes of unauthorized content would be controversial , " says the group , " but we believe that it is in the interest of both ISP's and content producers to examine such alternatives carefully and act to the degree it can be determined that such content is not authorized for redistribution . "
Rogers , one of Canada 's big ISPs , also chimed in and explained that new regulations might limit its ability to throttle P2P uploads , which it does at the moment .
" P2P file sharing is designed to cause network congestion , " says the company .
" It contributes significantly to latency , thereby making the network unreliable for certain users at periods of such congestion . "
Throttling , in its view , is therefore necessary , and if the situation sounds just like the Comcast case here in the US , Rogers assures CRTC that " the Comcast case involved a set of very unique facts that are unlikely to occur again .
Rogers ’ traffic shaping practices are very different from those employed by Comcast . "
Not everyone is pleased with the current hands - off situation toward the Internet , especially companies that are directly affected by discriminatory policies .
Canadian website operator Pelmorex offered the CRTC a long and candid list of ways that its own business has been affected by ISPs .
But it is clear that significant forces in Canada would like to maintain the discretion to throttle , shape , or manage traffic on their own terms .
The CRTC will hold a public hearing on the issue this summer in Gatineau .

Is there anything Google can't do ?
Google mapping technology , the subject of intense international criticism last week with the introduction of the Latitude location - based social application , steps in to save the day by mapping raging Australian bushfires .
This weekend , as the largest bushfires Australia has ever seen ravaged the landscape , engineers at Google Australia lent a helping hand by creating a Google Map that tracks the progress of the fires and provides essential information to those at risk .
The map allows Australian citizens to keep track of clear , threatened , and danger zones via color - coded points , and also helps authorities to keep unnecessary traffic out of the afflicted areas .
By informing the public about safe travel routes and impending threats , the map permits a more rapid response from emergency service teams who might otherwise have become bogged down in throngs of panic - stricken , fleeing civilians .
( Source : cnet.com )
The map also enables users to check on updates from the State of Victoria 's County Fire Authority , and to access relief information from Red Cross Australia .
( Source : appspot.com )
The fires have already claimed over 108 lives to date , and authorities are sure the number will grow as they continue to search new areas afflicted by the destruction .

What Else Can Google Tell Us About the Fires ?
Google mapping technology offers another insight into the Australian tragedy with their application Google Earth .
The Earth application updates its images via satellite every few hours at the most and shows satellite photographic imagery of selected areas .
For those who have downloaded the application , it can reveal a first - hand glimpse of the devastation wreaked by the fires -- what Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd described as " hell in all its fury . "
( Source : telegraph.co.uk )
The Google fire map is just one way that technology can benefit mankind on a larger and more profound scale .
Despite criticism about privacy violation and the potential for a watchful " big brother " to emerge from Google 's massive presence in the online community , there is certainly no arguing that there are benefits to their all - knowing location technology , too .
In the worst of times , which are the best of stocks ?
So many readers have emailed me to warn that we are going into another Great Depression that I decided to find out which companies and sectors did best after the Crash of 1929 .

A former Border Patrol agent cops a plea , another jail guard gets busted , a mystery is solved in Alabama , and one remains in Minnesota .
Let 's get to it :
In Laredo , Texas , a former Border Patrol officer pleaded guilty Tuesday to accepting bribes to escort a load of drugs through Zapata County .
Leonel Morales , 30 , admitted in federal court that he took $ 9,000 ensure that 20 kilograms of cocaine made it safely through the county .
The guilty plea came in the face of prosecutors prepared to introduce audio and video recordings of Morales planning , negotiating , and coordinating the drugs ' movements .
Morales faces up to 15 years in prison and remains in custody while awaiting a March 18 sentencing hearing .
In Decatur , Alabama , a Decatur police sergeant faces theft and additional charges after disappearing last Friday , only to show up in Las Vegas , where he was arrested .
Police Sgt. Faron
White allegedly stole $ 70,000 in drug money from the department 's narcotics office , then attempted to cover up his crime by trashing his office to make it appear he had been assaulted and kidnapped .
His family reported him missing Saturday , and local police spent several days searching the Tennessee River and surrounding areas looking for him .
Also arrested as an accomplice was Sarah Richardson , who picked White up at the police station Friday night and drove him to Nashville to catch a flight to Las Vegas .
According to a police affidavit , Richardson was aware
White had stolen the cash stash and helped him so he could " avoid apprehension . "
In Kissimmee , Florida , an Osceola County jail guard was arrested last Friday on charges he smuggled drugs into the jail .
Guard Eric Sosa , 30 , become prisoner Eric Sosa after he left the jail during a break to buy marijuana from an undercover officer .
He is charged with drug possession with the intent to sell , as well of introduction of contraband into a county facility and other charges .
In Lewiston , Minnesota , the acting mayor has reported that money , drugs , and documents are missing from the Lewiston Police Department 's evidence locker and close to $ 50,000 in city funds are unaccounted for .
Police discovered that drugs seized as evidence and " a couple of thousand bucks " were missing from the evidence locker when they took an inventory nearly a year ago upon the hiring of an interim police chief .
The evidence locker , which can be opened only with a key , was in the police chief 's office .
The Winona County District Attorney 's Office is investigating .
The acting mayor also told the city council that $ 50,000 given to the city by the fire department is unaccounted for , as are many official documents , including minutes of council meetings from 2005 .
MANCHESTER , England -- The International Olympic Committee and two of Michael Phelps ' leading sponsors expressed support for the Olympic great Monday , a day after he apologized for being photographed in a British newspaper inhaling from a marijuana pipe .
The IOC said Monday it was confident Phelps would learn from his " inappropriate behavior " and continue to serve as a role model .
Luxury Swiss watchmaker Omega termed Phelps ' actions a private matter and " nonissue . "
Swim wear manufacturer Speedo called the 23 - year - old American a " valued member of the Speedo team . "
" Michael Phelps is a great Olympic champion , " the IOC said in a statement e-mailed to The Associated Press .
" He apologized for his inappropriate behavior .
We have no reason to doubt his sincerity and his commitment to continue to act as a role model . "
Phelps acknowledged " regrettable " behavior and " bad judgment " after the photo appeared Saturday in the tabloid News of the World .
Speedo gave Phelps a $ 1 million bonus for his record eight gold medals at the Beijing Olympics .
Phelps joined Speedo in 2001 , a year after making his Olympic debut in Sydney .
He dominated the Beijing Games in the company 's high - tech LZR Racer suit .
" In light of Michael Phelps ' statement yesterday , Speedo would like to make it clear that it does not condone such behavior and we know that Michael truly regrets his actions , " Speedo , which is based in Nottingham , said in a statement to The Associated Press .
" Michael Phelps is a valued member of the Speedo team and a great champion .
We will do all that we can to support him and his family . "
Omega said it was " strongly committed " to its relationship with Phelps , calling his Beijing accomplishments " among the defining sporting achievements in the history of sport . "
" The current story in the press involves Michael Phelps ' private life and is , as far as Omega is concerned , a nonissue , " the company said .
Sports performance beverage PureSport 's maker , which tapped Phelps to be spokesman for its first national advertising campaign , also said Monday that it stands by him but it said it does not condone his behavior .
" We applaud the fact that he has taken full and immediate responsibility for his mistake and apologized to us , his fans and the public and we support him during this difficult time , " said Michael Humphrey , chief executive of Human Performance Labs .
Hilton Hotels Corp. , whose relationship with Phelps dates to 2007 , likewise stuck with him .
" We continue to support Michael Phelps as an athlete whose numerous athletic feats outshine an act of regrettable behavior , " the statement said .
But former sponsor Rosetta Stone , the foreign - language tutorial vendor , which had a one - year deal with the athlete that ended Dec. 31 , did not like the news .
" We do not condone his activities and are disappointed in his recent judgment , " Rosetta Stone said in a statement .
Both AT&T Inc. and PowerBar nutrition bar makers Nestle SA , two other big sponsors , quietly ended their relationships with Phelps at the end of 2008 .
Neither company would comment on the photo or describe the duration or value of their contracts .
A spokesman at sports marketing agency Octagon , which represents Phelps , said the athlete is taking this seriously .
" He has spoken with his sponsors to personally apologize .
We are encouraged by their support , " the spokesman said .
The News of the World said the picture was taken during a November house party while Phelps was visiting the University of South Carolina .

Ben Goldacre 's writing might be well known to some of you .
As the author of the popular Bad Science column in the Guardian , Goldacre regularly takes on the pseudoskeptics , cranks , denialists , and the rest of the anti-science brigade .
One of his more high - profile bugbears has been the anti-vaccine movement , and that fight has landed him in legal trouble .
At issue is a post that appeared on Goldacre 's site earlier in the week , which featured an audio capture of a phone - in show on a London radio station .
Thanks to the radio station 's lawyers , the clip has been taken down , although the magic of Google 's cache means it 's right here for your enjoyment .
In the clip , Jeni Barnett , a radio host who will be familiar to fellow Londoners , took on vaccination programs , and managed to spin just about every line possible from the pseudoskeptic handbook over the course of the programme .
The ranting against the concept of herd immunity is breathtaking , as is the sheer ignorance on display from both the host and a number of her guests .
There are some pure gems from the host and her callers , such as suggestions that vaccines put kids at risk of cancer and the revelation that " children get childhood diseases for a reason . "
The caller responsible for that particular gem is apparently a homeopath , which is striking , given that its practitioners often use vaccines to justify its contention that " like cures like . "
Clearly , there is a degree of public interest in comment on some of the misinformation , which would seem to fall within the UK 's fair use provisions .
But the length of the excerpt might have run afoul of the " no more than is necessary is included , " limits of fair use .
Ben Goldacre apparently thought that the show in its entirety was necessary to convey the horror .
Google 's cache is n't the only place you can catch the audio anymore .
Goldacre has quite an Internet following , and they 've apparently decided to fight the takedown by placing the audio on YouTube as well as a number of blogs .
It 's hard to determine exactly what the radio station hopes to accomplish by suing in a case where reasonable claims can be made regarding fair use .
Because he 's widely read , Goldacre was providing the station and this show with a global spotlight , which had to have been appealing from the " no publicity is bad publicity " perspective .
Of course , the publicity involved highlighting the station 's broadcast of irresponsible nonsense on a public health issue , so one suspects that there may be a degree of embarrassment involved , either on the part of the station or the show 's host .
It 's also beginning to seem that the antivaccine movement is intrinsically aligned with the legal system .
Andrew Wakefield 's erroneous ( and perhaps fraudulent ) claims about the MMR vaccine stemmed from a class action suit looking to buy some science , and a US blogger was ensnared in another vaccine lawsuit for daring to write about the topic .
In some ways , the lawsuit may wind up being a public good .
LBC 's legal attempt to stop more people hearing the broadcast has almost certainly failed , now that Goldacre 's cause has been taking up by the Internet community .
If it results in a greater public awareness that the antivaccination movement belongs in Bad Science , that will have been a good thing .
A government survey to find Britain 's most unpopular invention has put the singalong box on top .
Chris Green charts its rise from Japanese curiosity to living - room fixture
Anyone who has ever entered their local pub looking for a quiet pint , only to be driven out of by a group of inebriated middle - aged divorcees crowded around a microphone wailing the approximate tune of " I Will Survive " , would surely testify that the karaoke machine is one of the most infernal devices ever devised by humans .
Now , the public 's silent hatred has gained official recognition .
The humble singalong box , with its giant library of backing tracks and relentless autocue , has been crowned as the gadget the British most wish had never been invented .
A government survey asked more than 2,500 adults to name the gadgets they regarded as the most important as well as the most irritating .
Almost a quarter said that they wished the karaoke machine had never seen the light of day , with other creations including 24 - hour sports channels , computer games consoles and mobile phones also topping the list of anathema .
Invented in 1971 by a Japanese musician called Inoue Daisuke , karaoke – which means " empty orchestra " – gained immense popularity in Asia before spreading to the rest of the world in the 1980s .
Daisuke never patented his invention , which he made by combining a car stereo , a coin box and an amplifier , saying that it had simply never occurred to him to call such a product his intellectual property .
Estimates suggest he lost out on a potential fortune of $ 150m .
Karaoke is still a popular pastime in Japan , where establishments known as karaoke boxes attract a regular clientele of businessmen , families and students alike .
A collection of small rooms , each with its own monitor and microphones , are arranged around a communal bar and are available for customers to rent space and sing to their heart 's content .
To the disappointment of those who loathe the machines , this practice of isolating karaoke singers in padded rooms has yet to take off in a big way in the UK .
" Seeing the karaoke machine at the top of that list made me smile , " says inventor Kane Kramer , a director of the British Inventors Society credited with the technology behind the iPod .
" When people are singing karaoke they are enjoying themselves , but as a member of the audience you are just watching somebody who can't perform – and is n't particularly pleasant to listen to – for as long as you can bear it .
" It is antisocial .
You might have 10 people who want to sing some karaoke , which means 150 people have to suffer it .
But the crazy thing is that people still do go just to be a spectator at other people 's inability to sing .
After a short while – unless they 're very drunk – they 're going to find that listening to performers failing to perform for two hours is not the best way to spend the evening . "
The people who brought the karaoke machine to the UK were Ivor Arbiter and his daughter Joanne , whose Arbiter Group is a leading supplier of musical instruments and audio equipment .
Mr Arbiter , who died in 2005 , started importing the machines after they visited a Japanese trade show in 1987 .
His daughter was obsessed with becoming a pop star .
Four years later , the pair started manufacturing machines and supplying them to pubs , along with the tapes of backing tracks .
Joanne , who was 27 then , is now 48 .
Although she never made it as a pop singer , she still regards the karaoke machine as wonderful .
When The Independent told her of the karaoke machine 's unfortunate title , she said : " It 's odd , considering that things like the X Factor have come from it , which is one of the most successful things on telly .
It might be irritating in the pub , but it's also given millions of people who did n't know they could sing the opportunity to discover they can .
" When we started , we saw it as a way of providing a backing band for singers who did n't have one .
I went to pubs in Manchester and all over the country and heard the most amazing talent .
People were packing into the pubs to hear the great people , not the terrible ones , and in some villages the good singers became local celebrities . "
She also rejects the idea that karaoke is antisocial , recalling the days when people who would previously have sat in their local pub refusing to talk to anyone would suddenly have something to talk about .
" Karaoke takes people out , gets them out of themselves and is a way of letting your hair down , " she says .
" There have always been two sides to it : the people who sing brilliantly and attract people into venues , and the people who get up in a group when they 're drunk and drive everyone mad .
People watch programmes like the X Factor for the same reasons , because you 've got the idiots and you 've got the geniuses ; that 's what karaoke is all about . "
The karaoke machine has other supporters .
Rob Law , an inventor whose range of children 's suitcases has become a huge hit after being rejected by investors on the BBC programme Dragons '
Den , said finishing top of such a list could be taken as a backhanded compliment .
" Looking down the list of irritating gadgets , most are devices that have become extremely popular , " he says .
" If you 've created a product that has become so popular that it 's become annoying , then you 're going to be put down as pretty great inventor . "
Mr Law 's own invention was intended to cut the annoyances of travelling with young children , but he admitted they would share the karaoke machine 's fate as an irritating gadget if every family used them .
" Mobile phones are a great device , but because they 've become so popular they 've also become annoying .
I was surprised to see the karaoke machine up there , because my favourite worst invention has always been the automated call centre .
It 's just awful . "

When a handful of Senate Republicans slashed over $ 100 billion from the economic stimulus package , they specifically targeted $ 40 billion in proposed aid to states .
Helping rescue states , Sen. Collins & Co. said , does not stimulate the economy , and as such does n’t belong in the legislation .
Democratic leaders reluctantly went along — they were n’t given a choice since Republicans refuse to give the bill an up - or - down vote — and the $ 40 billion in aid was eliminated .
It ’s probably worth taking a moment to consider the consequences of this .
States , facing the kind of crisis unseen in generations , are prohibited from running deficits , and are averse to raising taxes , so drastic shortfalls mean drastic cuts — which in turn make the effects of the recession worse .
They have plundered reserves , enacted hiring freezes and engaged in all manner of budgetary voodoo to shield us from the pain .
But now state governments — reeling from a historic free fall in tax revenue — have run out of tricks .
And Americans are about to feel it .
In some cases , they already have .
Nevada resident Margaret Frye - Jackman , 71 , was diagnosed in August with ovarian cancer .
She had two rounds of chemotherapy at University Medical Center , the only public hospital in the Las Vegas area .
Soon after , she and her daughter heard the news on TV :
The hospital ’s outpatient oncology services were closing because of state Medicaid cuts .
Treatment for Frye - Jackman and hundreds of other cancer patients was eliminated .
Luckily , Frye - Jackman ’s gynecological oncologist , Dr. Nick Spirtos , decided to open a tiny chemotherapy center in his office ’s empty storage room .
Today , he treats Frye - Jackman there , along with about 20 more cancer patients who were dumped by the hospital .
Frye - Jackman ’s care is paid for with Medicare and supplemental insurance , but other patients can’t cover the cost of full treatment .
The doctor has considered putting donation boxes in the lobby .
“ If this is what it ’s like in Nevada , with cancer stuff closing , is it like that everywhere ? ” said Frye - Jackman ’s daughter , Margaret Bakes , accompanying her mother to the doctor ’s recently .
“ Are all the other states closing stuff too ? ”
As a matter of fact , yes .
Collectively , states are looking at a $ 47.4 - billion gap for 2009 , which is likely to get considerably worse in 2010 and 2011 .
The result , as the LAT noted , will be massive layoffs at the state level and huge cutbacks in services : “ Parks will close .
Environmental programs will be scaled back .
Bus and ferry routes will shut down , possibly sending more drivers onto clogged streets and highways .
Schools may go without school nurses , and classes may become more crowded .
Sick people who rely on state health programs may instead get sicker . ”
Cutting state aid from the stimulus bill is a very bad idea .
Congress can get the money to states quickly , and give states a much needed boost at exactly the right time .
I do n’t know what Collins & Co. are thinking , but they need to think again .

MEXICO CITY  Mexico ’s economy is being dragged down by the recession to the north .
American addicts have turned Mexico into a drug superhighway , and its police and soldiers are under assault from American guns .
Nafta promised 15 years ago that Mexican trucks would be allowed on American roads , but Congress said they were unsafe .
United States - Mexican relations are in the midst of what can be described as a neighborly feud , one that stretches along a lengthy shared fence .
That border fence , which has become a wall in some places , is another irritant .
Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton arrives in Mexico on Wednesday for what will be the first in a parade of visits by top administration officials , including President Obama himself next month , to try to head off a major foreign policy crisis close to home .
They will find a country mired in a deepening slump , miffed by signs of protectionism in its largest trading partner , and torn apart by a drug war for which many in Mexico blame customers in the United States .
There is plenty of angst on the other side as well .
Many American communities are worried about drug violence spilling over the border , and about Mexican immigrants taking scarce jobs .
That is forcing the Obama administration , already managing two wars and a deep recession , to fashion a new Mexico policy earlier than it might have wished .

Rep. Maxine Waters asks CEO 's about their practice of raising credit card limits at the Bank CEO hearing today .
How many of us have had a sudden jump in our interest rates without ever even knowing it .
Which of course never allows people to pay off the debt .
Waters is making a key point here .
Waters :
Since you received TARP money , have any of you increased the amount of interest on the credit cards by sending out letters to the consumers , to your credit card holders indicating that this was part of the contract even though this was in small print and you now have the ability to do it , have any of you Did any of you do that ?
Did you do this ?
CEO : I was volunteering .
First of all I feel like corporal of the universe not captain of the universe .
Waters :
Did you increase your credit card interest rate ?
CEO : In 2008 , we increased interest rates on 9 % of our customers .
Waters :
Thank you very much , did anyone else increase credit card rates after you received TARP money ?
Anyone else , if so would you please raise your hand .
( most of them did )
You sent out the letters I 'm trying to describe ?
Saying that you have the authority to do that .
Did any of you reduce the amount of credit that was available to credit card holders because they shopped at certain stores ?
Just raise your hand if you did .
None of you did .
Let the record reflect , none of them raised their hands .
A major complaint about Google ’s Chrome web browser has been that so far , it is still not available on anything other than Windows .
Google promised to deliver Chrome to Mac OS X and Linux as well , but as it turns out , this is a little harder than they anticipated , Ben Goodger , Google ’s Chrome interface lead , has explained in an email .
It has also been revealed what toolkit the Linux version of Chrome will use : Gtk + .
The decision to use native user interface toolkits on each platform has made it all the more difficult to deliver the Mac and Linux versions of Chrome .
Several people wondered why Google did n’t just use
Qt from the get - go , which would ’ve made the whole process a whole lot easier .
Goodger explains that Google “ [ avoids ] cross platform UI toolkits because while they may offer what superficially appears to be a quick path to native looking UI on a variety of target platforms , once you go a bit deeper it turns out to be a bit more problematic . ”
Your applications end up “ speaking with a foreign accent ” , he adds .
In addition , Goodger claims that using something like Qt “ limits what you can do to a lowest common denominator subset of what ’s supported by that framework on each platform . ”
As for the Linux version , Google initially thought that a Windows clone would be acceptable , since Chrome itself is already such a fast application .
However , the people working on the Linux version of Chrome made a case for using Gtk+ instead , and Google went with that option .
Since Chrome is open source , it could still be possible that a Qt version will be developed independently of Google , of course .
When it comes to the Mac version , Goodger explains that the plan there has been to develop a native version all along .
“ A Windows - clone would most definitely not be acceptable on MacOS X , ” Goodger says , “ where the APIs for UI development are highly evolved and have many outstanding features .
So that ’s always been the plan there . ”
The Mac version is coming along nicely , and Google hopes to deliver both the Linux and Mac versions somewhere in June .
Hopefully , they will also implement something like Firefox ’s NoScript extension because according to some users , the security model is still lacking .

President Obama has been a little slow in building a narrative of the Whys and Wherefores of the situation he unexpectedly inherited .
So it was a step in the right direction last week when he said at his press conference , “ [ T ] his crisis did n’t happen overnight and it did n’t result from any one action or decision .
It took many years and many failures to lead us here .
And it will take many months and many different solutions to lead us out . ”
Not that it ’s easy to build political consensus about a crisis .
People are still arguing about the causes and cures of the Great Depression , after all .
But it is critically important to make a beginning : the midterm elections are barely eighteen months away .
So I was glad to see both Paul Krugman and Alan Greenspan last week take a crack at explanation .
Greenspan , writing in the Financial Times , traced the origins of the system that broke down to “ the extraordinary risk management discipline that developed out of the writings of the University of Chicago ’s Harry Markowitz in the 1950s . ”
That skein of work had won several Nobel Prizes , Greenspan noted , for Markowitz and others .
( The story of the first 35 years or so was beautifully told by Peter Bernstein in 1991 in Capital Ideas : The Improbable Origins of Modern Wall Street . )
The discipline had been gradually embraced over a half century , the former Fed chairman noted , not just by academia but by a large majority of financial professionals and regulators around the world .
Then in 2007 , the risk - management structure cracked – overwhelmed , on the one hand , by the complexity of the instruments , and , on the other , by insufficient capital reserves put by against loss .
Krugman , not surprisingly , zeroed in on the deregulation of financial markets that followed the election of Ronald Reagan in 1980 , after which the financial sector began to grow rapidly .
“ Old - fashioned banking was increasingly replaced by wheeling and dealing on a grand scale , ” he wrote in The New York Times last Friday .
The size of the financial sector soon doubled – even in the go - go years of the 1960s , the finance and insurance industries had amounted to no more than 4 percent of the American economy , but by the eve of the current crisis they had grown to 8 percent of GDP – largely on the strength of the Markowitz - inspired process known as securitization , turning illiquid debt instruments such as mortgages into tradeable securities .
Myself , I thought of Nathan Rosenberg .
Not that Rosenberg , 81 , ever worked for a bank of any sort , a hedge fund , an insurance company – or even a think - tank .
He is a retired Stanford University economist , the author of several books , including Inside the Black Box and How the West Grew Rich ( with L.E. Birdzell ) , one of the nation ’s most distinguished historians of technology .
There is not a rapacious bone in his body .
But it was Rosenberg who , in 1962 , clearly formulated an idea that , once it had passed through a great many hands , was used to justify policies in the Nineties and early Oughts that have proved to be ruinous , at least in the present day .
By that time , Rosenberg ’s idea had acquired a name – General Purpose Technology , or GPT .
And while no one has done more to hone our sense of how economic growth unfolds to national advantage than Rosenberg , it is also true that , once everyone understands how a policy trick works , the trick stops working .
( In central banking that ’s called Goodhart ’s Law . )
The great thing about Rosenberg ’s discovery – it is not too much , I think , to call it that – goes a long way towards illuminating what those wild and crazy bankers and their political enablers were thinking among themselves – to the extent they were thinking – as they levered up the Anglo - American financial system to nosebleed levels .
Let me explain .
Consider , as did Rosenberg , in “ Technological Change in the Machine Tool Industry , 1840 - 1910 , ” the history of the turret lathe .
In 1820 , no machine tool industry existed in the United States ( or , for that matter , anywhere in the world ) .
There were plenty of machines , of course , but they were home - made affairs , built on an ad hoc basis by those who would ultimately use them .
Forging and cutting metal into the precise shapes required for looms , gears , boilers and axles was n’t easy .
Not surprisingly , factories specializing in a final product – in textiles , especially – had the best machine shops .
Lowell Mills , in Lowell , Mass . , and the Amoskeag Manufacturing Co. , in Manchester , New Hampshire , began selling textile machinery to other firms and then various other sorts of machinery as well : steam engines , turbines , mill machinery and , most important , the cutting , drilling and shaping tools they used to make their own machines .
B etween 1840 and 1880 , a vast wave of mechanization occurred .
The Lowell Machine Shop became independent of its mills in 1845 .
Soon it was producing steam locomotives for the new railroads .
The Baldwin Locomotive Works , in Philadelphia , emerged from a textile - printing firm to become the nation ’s largest engine - maker .
Arms manufacturers invented a series of lighter tools for making interchangeable parts that could be assembled smoothly into weapons – jigs , taps and gauges , turret lathes , milling machines , precision - grinders .
Whole new industries emerged : shoe machinery , locomotives , dynamos , bicycles , sewing machines , typewriters , and , of course , the machine tool industry itself , heavily concentrated in the Connecticut and Ohio River valleys , providing lathes , planers , drillers , borers , grinders , millers and shapers to all the rest .
T hat this specialization proceeded by spin - off had long been noted , Rosenberg wrote .
Less commonly recognized was the underlying process he called technological convergence – the process by which a solution to a problem in one industry is quickly employed to solve roughly similar problems in other industries .
He illustrated it with the story of a series of lathes .
Thomas Blanchard ’s stocking lathe of 1818 , invented to carve gunstocks , which previously had required whittling , boring and chiseling by hand , was quickly put to work making hat blocks , wheel spokes , oars , sculptured busts and shoe lasts .
Stephen
Fitch ’s turret lathe of 1845 , with its cluster of tools held on a vertical axis , made it possible to perform a sequence of operations without removing the piece from the lathe .
Fitch built the first one to make parts for government pistols , but soon the principle was adapted by other hands to make components for watches , sewing machines , typewriters , locomotives , bicycles and , eventually , automobiles .
Sewing machines provided a further example : mechanized stitching gave rise to huge industries of mass - produced boots and shoes , ready - to - wear clothing , and was employed in countless other ways , manufacturing everything from tents and sails to harnesses and books .
Rosenberg concluded :
The interesting thing about the group of industries discussed here is that they were all dependent in their development upon technological changes dealing with a limited number of processes and that the solution to problems posed by these processes eventually became the specialized function of a well - organized industry .
A question of more contemporary interest is whether similar technological convergences are occurring in twentieth century conditions ; whether , for example , the chemical and electronics industries are playing the same roles for production and transmittal that machine tools played at an earlier stage of our history .
Rosenberg ’s paper , which appeared in the Journal of Economic History in 1963 , became an underground classic among those who thought about the economics of specialization , along with essays by Adam Smith , Allyn Young and George Stigler , but it otherwise lay little read and unattended by economists concerned with macroeconomics .
Its gist , on the other hand – that certain sectors contained the possibility for growth so rapid that they would cause compositional changes in the economy itself – gradually became part of the folklore of post - World War II America .
The point was neatly encapsulated in the patronizing advice a businessman gives his partner ’s 22 - year - old son in the 1967 movie “ The Graduate : ” “ I just want to say one word to you – just one word – ‘ plastics . ’ ”
There continued to occur such “ revolutions , ” ( that being the word most often used to describe the advent of transformative new technologies ) – microprocessors one decade , software the next , the Internet and the World Wide Web the decade after – and gradually economists took note .
In 1990 , Harvard Business School guru Michael Porter published The Competitive Advantage of Nations , with its emphasis on the advantages derived from the clustering of related industries , including financial services .
The following year , Stanford economist Paul David gave a major push to such thinking with “ The Computer and the Dynamo , ” a paper comparing the history of the diffusion of the electric motor between 1880 and 1930 with that of the computer .
And in 1995 , Manuel Trajtenberg and Stanford University economist Timothy Bresnahan introduced a formal model to describe various “ general purpose technologies ” as engines of growth – the steam engine , electricity , the laser , the computer , the Internet .
Which brings us back to the current crisis .
Until recently , the American and British banking and financial services industries were understood , however imperfectly , both by their practitioners and those who sought to regulate them , as embodying a GPT for the twenty - first century , a worthy successor to the Internet technology boom that sent American servers , routers and fiberoptic cable , and British media and advertising , around the world .
To them , that compositional shift of financial services to 8 percent from 4 percent indicated success , not excess ( though perhaps today no one doubts that it went too far )
If there is a good history of the modern financial industry , chronicling the development of its many recondite risk - management techniques , on the model of , say , Janet Abbate ’s Inventing the Internet , or M. Mitchell Waldrop ’s The Dream Machine : J.C.R. Licklider and the Revolution that Made Computing Personal , I do n’t know it .
The closest probably is still Ross Paving Wall Street : Experimental Economics and the Quest for the Perfect Market .
Equally interesting , though heavier on the sociology of finance than the underlying economic rationale , is An Engine Not a Camera : How Financial Models Shape Markets , by Donald MacKenzie .
Soon the histories of credit default swaps will begin rolling in , led by Gillian Tett ’s Fool ’s Gold .
( Matt Taibbi has a boisterous version of the many of the same events , The Big Takeover , in the current Rolling Stone . )
But capturing the broad outlines of the story of the rise of modern finance , perhaps from the moment when the old Chicago Butter and Egg Board reorganized itself as the Chicago Mercantile Exchange and set out to create the first financial derivatives , trading futures on currencies , Treasury bills and interest rates , will be the work of many years .
In the meantime , though , to understand the difference of opinion that has developed between the administration and its liberal critics over how to go about recapitalizing the banking industry , it helps to recognize that , from the quarterdeck at least , the question is as much one of industrial policy as public finance .
For whatever combination of political and strategic reasons , the administration wants to keep the industry more or less intact .
The critics would prefer to break it up to some degree .
It is crucial that policymakers and their interpreters begin to fill in some of the blanks .

PLENTY of people can be blamed for the calamity on Capitol Hill on September 29th .
Two - hundred and twenty - eight congressmen decided they were ready to risk another Great Depression .
Nancy Pelosi made an idiotic speech damning the Republicans .
Sheriff McCain claimed that he was going to ride into town to sort out the mess — and promptly fell off his horse .
But there is no doubt where the lion 's share of the blame belongs : with George Bush .
The dismal handling of the financial crisis over the past fortnight is not only a comment on Mr Bush 's personal shortcomings as a leader .
It is a comment on the failure of his leadership style over the past eight years .
The convenient excuse for Mr Bush 's performance is that he is at the fag - end of his presidency .
Public attention has shifted to the presidential candidates , and the members of the House face the electorate in a month .
But this rings hollow : there is nothing about the political cycle that dictates that an outgoing president should have an approval rating of 27 % and an army of enemies on Capitol Hill .
Bill Clinton ended his two terms with ratings of close to 70 % .
The crisis underlined Mr Bush 's two biggest personal weaknesses — his leaden tongue and his indecisiveness .
He failed to explain in simple language that a crisis on Wall Street also means a crisis on Main Street .
The self - styled decider was also singularly lacking in decisiveness .
He handed responsibility for the bail - out to a technocrat , his treasury secretary , Hank Paulson , but then failed to provide him with the necessary political backup .
He started lobbying legislators only days before the vote .
He failed to travel to Capitol Hill to make a personal appeal to Congress .
Worse still , he wasted political capital on a farcical photo - op meeting in the White House with the presidential candidates .
Mr Clinton would have done things a lot better .
Catastrophe will probably be averted , at least for now .
As The Economist went to press , it looked as if the rescue package would pass through the House of Representatives , perhaps as early as October 3rd : it was approved by the Senate on October 1st .
But this was less thanks to the Bush administration than to the fact that a run on the markets has put the fear of God into legislators .
Moreover , the collapse of the rescue package was part of a wider pattern of failure : almost everything that the Bush administration has attempted since 2004 , most notably Social Security reform and immigration reform , has ended in failure .
This succession of failures is a verdict on Mr Bush 's leadership style .
The Bush administration has been defined by two things — ruthless partisanship and an iron commitment to presidential power .
In his first term Mr Bush pushed through a conservative agenda of huge tax cuts and a war against Iraq despite the fact that he had the narrowest of mandates .
In his re-election bid in 2004 he relied on supercharging the conservative base rather than reaching out to middle - of - the - road voters .
The Bush administration also treated Congress with something approaching contempt .
Mr Bush liked to think of himself as a CEO at the head of a government machine rather than as a politician in a town of politicians .
The first directive that his vice - president , Dick Cheney , gave to his chief counsel , David Addington , was to “ restore the powers of the presidency ” .
This contempt was unconcealed when it came to the Democrats ( Joe Lieberman excepted ) : Mr Cheney even told Vermont 's Patrick Leahy to “ go fuck yourself ” on the Senate floor .
But it extended to fellow Republicans .
The White House nonchalantly undermined one Senate majority leader , Trent Lott , because it thought that it could replace him with a more pliable one , Bill Frist .
It failed to keep Congress informed about important decisions , particularly on the “ war on terror ” , let alone involved in decision - making .
The Bush legacy
This my - way - or - the - highway partisanship destroyed Mr Bush 's ability to push through entitlement reforms .
Why should the Democrats take the risk of helping to change the system when Mr Bush was likely to take all the credit for success ?
It also destroyed his ability to win enough Democratic support for one of the most important bipartisan measures he championed , immigration reform .
On September 29th Mr Bush saw his rescue package torn apart by two groups of people who have been enraged by his political style — left - wing Democrats ( who regard him as the spawn of Satan ) and right - wing market fundamentalists .
He also saw Congress relishing the chance to humble the imperial presidency .
“ This is a democracy , ” remarked North Dakota 's Kent Conrad .
“ This is n't a dictatorship . ”
Mr Bush also paid the price for the defining cause of his presidency , the invasion of Iraq , an initiative which destroyed the bipartisan unity created by September 11th , 2001 .
The most stinging complaint against the Emergency Economic Stabilisation
Act of 2008 was that it bore an uneasy resemblance to the Iraq War Resolution of 2002 .
There was the same bid for untrammelled authority ( Mr Paulson 's initial request for $ 700 billion was a mere three pages ; Congress has expanded it to 450 pages ) ; the same alarmist rhetoric ( “ our entire economy is in danger ” ) ; and the same insistence that Congress should act immediately .
Sceptics battered the president with complaints about crying wolf .
The most damning verdict on Mr Bush this week came not from the Democrats but from the 133 Republicans who decided to vote against a Republican administration .
Mr Bush devoted much of his energy as president to forging a lasting Republican majority .
But over the past four years conservatives have turned against him on everything from immigration reform to financial management .
Far from creating a hegemonic party , Mr Bush leaves the Republicans in the worst state they have been in for decades ; riven by divisions , confused about their identity and facing Armageddon at the ballot box .
Grim New Report China 's Greenhouse Gas Emissions Threaten to Double
Can a climate catastrophe still be averted ?
Scientists voice pessimism in a new study , which concludes that no matter what the Western industrialized nations do , China 's greenhouse emissions will be hard to stop .
Von Volker Mrasek
( Fortune Magazine ) --
A few hours before the global launch of Nokia 's latest high - end phone , the company gave a sneak peek at the gadget to a dozen bloggers and journalists gathered at its swank Midtown Manhattan concept store .
With an elegant touchscreen that slid open to reveal a full keyboard , the device evoked lust in even the iPhone disciples present .
So when can we get it in the U.S. ?
The company 's answer : " Globally , sometime in the first half of 2009 . "
The U.S. launch will come after that .
No carrier has been announced .
In other words , just about never .
There 's no disputing Nokia 's dominance in the cellphone market .
With sales of $ 70 billion , it holds 40 % of the market globally .
Interbrand ranked it the world 's fifth - most - valuable brand , behind the likes of Coca - Cola and IBM .
In parts of rural India , Nokia ( NOK ) is to " phone " what Kleenex is to " tissue " : a synonym .
But in North America , despite a marketing blitz that includes two new American concept stores , a series of popular Nokia music venues , and a flashy billboard campaign peppering New York City 's subways , Nokia 's market share has slid to just 8 % from 15 % two years ago , according to research outfit IDC .
That is a huge problem for Nokia because North America is quickly becoming the world 's fastest - growing market for so - called smartphones , those high - end devices that surf the web .
Any cellphone company that hopes for world domination must lead the smartphone market too .
Nokia CEO Olli-Pekka Kallasvuo calls North America " extremely significant , " explaining that devices designed in the U.S. and Canada - namely Apple 's ( AAPL , Fortune 500 ) iPhone and RIM's ( RIMM ) BlackBerry - influence products in other countries .
The iPhone single - handedly made people more comfortable browsing the web from their palms , and it has spawned a wave of innovation among software developers in Silicon Valley .
Key missteps
Nokia has reinvented itself many times over , but it has never quite found a way to transform itself into a phonemaker relevant to Americans .
Founded as a paper mill during the Industrial Revolution , Nokia became a rubber maker , a cable business , a radio company , and finally a leading cellphone manufacturer .
It briefly gained a foothold in the U.S. in the late 1990s , when AT&T sold Nokia phones with its groundbreaking flat - rate wireless calling plan .
But Nokia insisted on a one - size - fits - all model for its products .
For example , it missed out when North American customers started to prefer flip phones over Nokia 's signature candy - bar - style phones .
Nokia also refused to cater to American phone companies ' whims .
In Europe and Asia , consumers usually buy phones and telephone service separately , so Nokia needs to please only the end user .
In the U.S. , where phones and service are sold together , carriers want control over the way the phones look and perform .
( Another challenge for Nokia is that the dominant wireless standard in North America is CDMA ; most Nokia phones are designed to operate on the global standard , GSM . )
A few years ago Nokia got serious about North America .
It installed its chief financial officer in the U.S.
It opened new offices in Atlanta to be close to AT&T Mobility ; last year it did likewise in Parsippany , N.J. , to be near Verizon Wireless .
And the company put several hundred product developers in its San Diego design center to work in collaboration with AT&T ( T , Fortune 500 ) and Verizon Wireless on some new products .
Those efforts have paid off for straight - up cellphones .
The first phone jointly designed with AT&T , a thin clamshell called the 6555 that looks an awful lot like Motorola 's ( MOT , Fortune 500 ) once - hot RAZR , appeared last May .
At AT&T 's behest , Nokia produced the phone in several different colors and changed the positions of some of the buttons .
In December , Nokia launched its third Verizon ( VZ , Fortune 500 ) phone , an elegant midrange gadget that Verizon named Mirage .
T - Mobile sells eight different Nokia handsets .
None of them are smartphones .
The problem is not the product .
The n97 might not be ready for sale , but Nokia 's e71 , which looks like a sleeker version of the BlackBerry Curve , has won design awards and dominates many European markets .
And it has several phones in its n-series of multimedia devices that boast the best cameras and videocams in the biz .
North American president Mark Louison says U.S. carriers will soon support the phones .
But ask the phone companies , and they say they have no plans to roll out Nokia smartphones anytime soon .
By lagging in smartphones Nokia is n't just missing out on sales ; it may also be losing the attention of software developers that make cool games and applications for mobile devices , a growing number of which operate in the U.S .
Nokia is reinventing itself yet again as an Internet company , a sort of Yahoo.com for your phone .
It is trying to woo application developers to its mobile platform through offices in Silicon Valley and Boston .
You'd think it would be tantalizing to write software for the world 's largest mobile platform .
But ask developers worldwide to show you their favorite mobile apps , and they 'll probably pull out their iPhones .
Cisco Systems , the reigning monarch of networking equipment , is preparing to challenge long - time compatriots Hewlett - Packard Co and IBM in a market that those two companies dominate : servers .
According to a report in Monday 's The New York Times by Reg alumnus Ashlee Vance , Cisco 's purported server line 's selling point will be its " sophisticated virtualization software . "
If so , Cisco will be helping itself not only by jumping into the current mass migration towards server - based virtualized services , but also - albeit to a much smaller degree - by taking advantage of the fact that it owns about two per cent of VMWare , the company that will presumably be supplying the aforementioned " sophisticated virtualization software . "
With complex virtualization schemes becoming the rule and not the exception in up - to - date data centers , Cisco is in a strong position to use its networking savvy to bind servers together into one big , happy - and highly efficient - virtualized family .
HP and IBM , which have for years created a strong market for Cisco 's networking hardware , may be none too pleased to see their former partner and mutual beneficiary muscling its way into their territory .
Not to worry , said Cisco .
The company 's chief technology officer Padmasree Warrior said Cisco sees the move " not as a new market , but a market transition . "
Exactly what level of the server market Cisco plans to invade first is not yet known - the company had n't respond to our requests for more information by press time - but according to our earlier report , the attack would begin at the blade level , and according to the Times , the incursion could start " as early as March . "
Whenever it does begin , however , expect HP to become more agressive with its own ProCurve line of networking equipment , and the IBM and Cisco alliance to feel the strain .
Times are tough in the IT market , and tough times engender tough battles .
As we could be about to witness . ®
Here we go folks down that slippery slope of stupidity once more .
It appears that the European Court of Human Rights has now ruled that the taking of a pictures without the explicit consent of the person being photographed is a violation of that person ’s right of privacy – even if it is taken in a public and even if it is never used .
This decision was the result of a court case involving a newborn baby who was put into a sterile unit when born .
At that point as a part of a commercial service provided by the hospital they took a photograph of the baby .
The child ’s parents in turn objected and demanded that the hospital hand over the negatives .
the hospital refused and when the Greek courts refused to hear the case it went before the European Court of Human rights .
“ The Court reiterated that the concept of private life was a broad one which encompassed the right to identity , ” said an ECHR press release about the ruling .
“ It stressed that a person ’s image revealed his or her unique characteristics and constituted one of the chief attributes of his or her personality . ”
“ The Court added that effective protection of the right to control one ’s image presupposed , in the present circumstances , obtaining the consent of the person concerned when the picture was being taken and not just when it came to possible publication , ” it said .
The ECHR said that the taking of the photograph breached the child ’s right to a private life as guaranteed by Article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights , and that the Greek courts had failed to uphold that right .

This does n’t bode well folks for all those photographers out there who bless us with some of the greatest pieces of art imaginable .
Guatemala Project Home >
Guatemalan Military Logbook Helen Mack , right , with lawyers Roxanna Altholz and Carmen Atkins present the case before the Inter - American Commission on Human Rights , Washington , DC The death squad dossier , smuggled out of Guatemalan military intelligence files in 1999 , is the only known document of its kind , revealing the fate of scores of Guatemalan citizens who were “ disappeared ” by the army during the mid-1980s .
The military logbook is now the focus of collective legal action being brought by more than a dozen of the families of victims before the Inter - American Commission on Human Rights .
The case is expected to set an important precedent for the use of official records in human rights cases in Guatemala , as well as serve as a prod to the Guatemalan Public Ministry to advance the case nationally , where it has been stalled for years due to lack of political will .
Kate Doyle has worked closely with lawyers and staff of the Myrna Mack Foundation ( the organization coordinating the families ) , and Roxanna Altholz , lead attorney for the families , of the Berkeley Human Rights Law Clinic .
In October 2007 , Kate Doyle gave expert testimony before the Inter - American Human Rights Commission , providing her assessment that the death squad activities recorded in the logbook were orchestrated by the Presidential General Staff ( Estado Mayor Presidential — EMP ) and carried out by members of the EMP ’s intelligence unit , called the Archivo . [
See video of IAHRC testimony , and previous posting on the Death Squad Dossier ]
The Commission is now in the process of deciding if the case will proceed to the Inter - American Human Rights Court .
NAZARETH – Extremist rabbis and their followers , bent on waging holy war against the Palestinians , are taking over the Israeli army by stealth , according to critics .
In a process one military historian has termed the rapid " theologization " of the Israeli army , there are now entire units of religious combat soldiers , many of them based in West Bank settlements .
They answer to hardline rabbis who call for the establishment of a Greater Israel that includes the occupied Palestinian territories .
Their influence in shaping the army ’s goals and methods is starting to be felt , say observers , as more and more graduates from officer courses are also Dr.awn from Israel ’s religious extremist population .
" We have reached the point where a critical mass of religious soldiers is trying to negotiate with the army about how and for what purpose military force is employed on the battlefield , " said Yigal Levy , a political sociologist at the Open University who has written several books on the Israeli army .
The new atmosphere was evident in the " excessive force " used in the recent Gaza operation , Dr. Levy said .
More than 1,300 Palestinians were killed , a majority of them civilians , and thousands were injured as whole neighborhoods of Gaza were leveled .
" When soldiers , including secular ones , are imbued with theological ideas , it makes them less sensitive to human rights or the suffering of the other side . "
The greater role of extremist religious groups in the army came to light last week when it emerged that the army rabbinate had handed out a booklet to soldiers preparing for the recent 22 - day Gaza offensive .
Yesh Din , an Israeli human rights group , said the material contained messages " bordering on racist incitement against the Palestinian people " and might have encouraged soldiers to ignore international law .
The booklet quotes extensively from Shlomo Aviner , a far - right rabbi who heads a religious seminary in the Muslim quarter of East Jerusalem .
He compares the Palestinians to the Philistines , the Biblical enemy of the Jews .
He advises : " When you show mercy to a cruel enemy , you are being cruel to pure and honest soldiers
This is a war on murderers . "
He also cites a Biblical ban on " surrendering a single millimeter " of Greater Israel .
The booklet was approved by the army ’s chief rabbi , Brig .
Gen. Avichai Ronsky , who is reportedly determined to improve the army ’s " combat values " after its failure to crush Hezbollah in Lebanon in 2006 .
Gen .
Ronsky was appointed three years ago in a move designed , according to the Israeli media , to placate hardline religious elements within the army and the settler community .
Gen .
Ronsky , himself a settler in the West Bank community of Itimar , near Nablus , is close to far - right groups .
According to reports , he pays regular visits to jailed members of Jewish terror groups ; he has offered his home to a settler who is under house arrest for wounding Palestinians ; and he has introduced senior officers to a small group of extremist settlers who live among more than 150,000 Palestinians in Hebron .
He has also radically overhauled the rabbinate , which was originally founded to offer religious services and ensure religious soldiers were able to observe the sabbath and eat kosher meals in army canteens .
Over the past year the rabbinate has effectively taken over the role of the army ’s education corps through its Jewish Awareness Department , which co-ordinates its activities with Elad , a settler organization that is active in East Jerusalem .
In October , the Haaretz newspaper quoted an unnamed senior officer who accused the rabbinate of carrying out the religious and political " brainwashing " of troops .
Dr. Levy said the army rabbinate ’s power was growing as the ranks of religious soldiers swelled .
Breaking the Silence , a project run by soldiers seeking to expose the army ’s behavior against Palestinians , said the booklet handed out to troops in Gaza had originated among Hebron ’s settlers .
" The document has been around since at least 2003 , " said Mikhael Manekin , 29 , one of the group ’s directors and himself religiously observant .
" But what is new is that the army has been effectively subcontracted to promote the views of the extremist settlers to its soldiers . "
The power of the religious right in the army reflected wider social trends inside Israel , Dr. Levy said .
He pointed out that the rural cooperatives known as kibbutzim that were once home to Israel ’s secular middle classes and produced the bulk of its officer corps had been on the wane since the early 1980s .
" The vacuum left by their gradual retreat from the army was filled by religious youngsters and by the chilDr.en of the settlements .
They now dominate in many branches of the army . "
According to figures cited in the Israeli media , more than one - third of all Israel ’s combat soldiers are religious , as are more than 40 per cent of those graduating from officer courses .
The army has encouraged this trend by creating some two dozen hesder yeshivas , seminaries in which youths can combine Biblical studies with army service in separate religious units .
Many of the yeshivas are based in the West Bank , where students are educated by the settlements ’ extremist rabbis .
Ehud Barak , the defense minister , has rapidly expanded the program , approving four yeshivas , three based in settlements , last summer .
Another 10 are reportedly awaiting his approval .
Mr. Manekin , however , warned against blaming the violence inflicted on Gaza ’s civilians solely on the influence of religious extremists .
" The army is still run by the secular elites in Israel and they have always been reckless with regard to the safety of civilians when they wage war .
Jewish nationalism that justifies Palestinian deaths is just as dangerous as religious extremism . "

The longest university strike in English Canada ends with back - to - work legislation this week .
As full - time faculty at York University we are distressed at the impact of this strike on our 50,000 students , who have confronted enormous disruption to their lives , finances and future .
With such disastrous consequences , what can we learn from this debacle for the future of labour relations in Ontario universities ?
The employer and much media claim that responsibility lies with a " selfish " union that advanced unrealistic wage demands during an economic recession .
Reality is more complex .
The spotlight on CUPE obscures the responsibility of York 's administration and board of governors .
Reluctant to negotiate since June , the administration spent two hours bargaining in November , refused to meet in December , and negotiated for four days in January before forcing a vote and another two - week delay on an offer already rejected by 90 per cent at a membership meeting .
Following the " no " vote and Premier McGuinty 's request that his appointed mediator " bang some heads together , " CUPE substantially eased its positions , including eliminating its wage - increase proposals , but again the employer did not move .
Instead of bargaining in good faith , York engaged in public relations and brinkmanship .
Tracing the process from start to end , it is evident that the employer never intended to bargain , waiting to either break the union or have it legislated back to work .
York administration cries " poor " and points to the recession .
However , their managerial tactics are rooted in decade - old policies of post - secondary education underfunding , market - friendly academic restructuring , and shifting priorities for spending York 's money .
Most damaging is the casualization of York 's faculty , which creates a " flexible " pool of expendable teaching staff .
Casualization emphasizes cost reduction but conceals negative costs of precarious employment for teachers and students .
Comparing the 1997/98 and 2007/08 York University Factbook shows a 46 per cent increase in full - time undergraduate enrolment .
The tenurable faculty complement increased by 28 per cent , a significant deterioration of student / full - time faculty ratios .
Course assignments to CUPE 3903 members increased by 112 per cent .
Dozens of current retirements are being replaced by part - timers who are arguably deserving of the tenure jobs being eliminated .
Contract faculty teach 54 per cent of York 's undergraduate courses for 7 per cent of its operating budget .
They work hard and often cobble together multi-campus course contracts to make a living , but they are being stripped of opportunities for quality teaching , research and academic engagement .
They are fighting to preserve hard - won benefits and to join other tenured faculty , many of whom are conversions through earlier contracts .
They see tenure gradually disappearing with little consultation or prudence .
Students are hit the worst .
More temporary faculty means less access to tenured faculty engaged in scholarly activity .
With tuition fees and class sizes both rising , students take on part - time jobs and mounting debt loads to finance a diminished learning experience .
Hiring more temporary faculty intensifies the burden on full - time colleagues through increased supervisory loads and fewer colleagues to perform administrative responsibilities .
While the administration is urging faculty to enhance the university 's research profile , they have less time for research activities .
Budgetary priorities aggravate the stresses .
While turning students over to poorly paid teaching staff , top administrators get a 17 per cent pay raise over two years , plan a high - priced medical school , and are silent about plans for $ 170 million raised by York Foundation .
The " final " offer from the employer to CUPE represented a decline in real income relative to the cost of living .
It reduced contractual opportunities for permanent appointments , increased the number of teaching - only appointments , reduced child - care benefits and support for graduate students , and exacerbated the bitter sense that the well - being of graduate students and temporary faculty and the academic integrity of the institution are being eroded by misplaced priorities .
York administration 's tactics have won this week , but what a pyrrhic victory !
Distressed students , plummeting enrolment , battered reputation , finances in havoc , an embattled president , and a bitter workforce – those are the challenges the university must now face .
Improving labour relations at York University and other Canadian universities will require a shift in administrative and budgetary priorities .
They must relinquish the claim that a reputable , research - intensive academic institution can rely on a casualized teaching workforce .
They must moderate executive salaries and shift more resources to teaching and research .
Finally , government needs to step up to the plate and appoint a task force to examine and offer solutions for the worrisome casualization of the teaching workforce in Ontario 's universities .
As the self - declared " education premier , " Dalton McGuinty should courageously redress the perils of underfunding and casualization for students , teachers and research .

Japan is grappling with its worst economic crisis since the end of World War II , the nation 's economic and fiscal policy minister said Monday .
The comments from Kaoru Yosano followed news of Japan 's gross domestic product falling at a 12.7 % annual rate in the fourth quarter in 2008 .
" This is the worst economic crisis in the post - war era , " Yosano said at a press conference , according to Japan 's Kyodo news agency .
The global economic crisis has pummeled Japan , which depends largely on its auto and electronics exports .
The slump in exports has led to tens of thousands of layoffs across Japan .
" Behind ( the contraction in GDP for ) the October - December quarter is a terrific downturn in exports , " he said , according to Kyodo .
" Like other major countries , our country cannot avoid the pains of structural change , " Yosano said .
To stimulate the economy , the Japanese parliament needs to act quickly on key budget measures , he said , referring to bills related to a second supplementary budget for fiscal 2008 and early passage of the state budget for fiscal 2009 .
Asked about Japan possibly producing a new economic stimulus plan in the short term , Yosano said wide - ranging discussions would be needed first .
" After seeing this level ( of GDP ) , it is our duty to think of various policy options , " he added .
“ You are not alone , ” Glenn Beck likes to say .
For the disaffected and aggrieved Americans of the Obama era , he could not have picked a better rallying cry .
Mr. Beck , an early - evening host on the Fox News Channel , is suddenly one of the most powerful media voices for the nation ’s conservative populist anger .
Barely two months into his job at Fox , his program is a phenomenon : it typically draws about 2.3 million viewers , more than any other cable news host except Bill O’Reilly or Sean Hannity , despite being on at 5 p.m. , a slow shift for cable news .
With a mix of moral lessons , outrage and an apocalyptic view of the future , Mr. Beck , a longtime radio host who jumped to Fox from CNN ’s Headline News channel this year , is capturing the feelings of an alienated class of Americans .
In an interview , Mr. Beck , who recently rewatched the 1976 film “ Network , ” said he identified with the character of Howard Beale , the unhinged TV news anchorman who declares on the air that he is “ mad as hell . ”

The California budget mess is rapidly turning into a full - blown crisis , thanks to being held hostage by some of the legislature 's minority Republicans :
LOS ANGELES —
The state of California — its deficits ballooning , its lawmakers intransigent and its governor apparently bereft of allies or influence — appears headed off the fiscal rails .
Since the fall , when lawmakers began trying to attack the gaps in the $ 143 billion budget that their earlier plan had not addressed , the state has fallen into deeper financial straits , with more bad news coming daily from Sacramento .
The state , nearly out of cash , has laid off scores of workers and put hundreds more on unpaid furloughs .
It has stopped paying counties and issuing income tax refunds and halted thousands of infrastructure projects .
Twenty - thousand layoff notices will go out on Tuesday morning , Matt David , the communications director for Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , said Monday night .
“ In the absence of a budget we need to realize this savings and the process takes six months , ” Mr. David said .
And what seems to be the problem ?
This may sound familiar :
Democrats , who had already given into Republicans ’ long - held dreams of large tax cuts for small businesses and for some of the entertainment industry and a proposed $ 10,000 tax break for first - time home buyers , balked at Mr. Maldonado ’s request that the Legislature tuck a bill into the package that would allow voters to cross party lines in primaries .
“ I think with an open primary , we would have good government that would do the people ’s work , ” Mr. Maldonado said .
The Party of No , faced with fiscal disaster , invariably holds out for political advantage .
Faced with Solomon 's decision , they will always insist on cutting the baby in half .
Paul Krugman warns :
Being a “ non-superhero ” , Jonah did not have a “ Rogues gallery ” comparable to Superman or The Flash , though he had a few adversaries who returned from time to time .
The first and most notable of these to date was Quentin Turnbull , known at first as simply the man with the eagle - topped cane .
Turnbull was the father of Hex ’s best friend , Jeb Turnbull .
During the American Civil War , Jonah actually surrendered himself to the Union forces after the passage of the Emancipation Proclamation , but refused to betray where his fellow soldiers were camped .
A Union soldier was able to determine the location of that camp by examining the dirt in the hooves of Jonah ’s horse .
The Union soldiers captured all of Jonah ’s fellow soldiers and then later massacred most of them , framing Jonah as a turncoat .
Turnbull ’s son was one of those slaughtered and Turnbull vowed his vengeance upon Jonah .
Turnbull hired an unnamed stage actor to impersonate Hex and help “ destroy Hex ” .
This actor , naming himself “ The Chameleon ” , was eventually hideously scarred in a fire started by Hex , and vowed vengeance upon Hex .
El Papagayo was a Mexican bandit running guns .
Hex was hired by the United States Secret Service ( actually a man hired by Turnbull to pose as an agent ) to infiltrate El Papagayo ’s band and bring him to justice .
Hex was unsuccessful and he and Papagayo met several more times over the years .

“ Top ” Watermark Using MooTools
Whenever you have a long page worth of content , you generally want to add a " top " anchor link at the bottom of the page so that your user does n't have to scroll forever to get to the top .
The only problem with this method is that I may want to get to the top of the page from somewhere in the middle .
Using MooTools , we can create a " top " link as a watermark that follows the users down the page .
The XHTML
< a href= " #top " id =" gototop " class = " no - click no - print " >
Top of Page </ a>
Place this anywhere inside the page that you would like .
The CSS
# gototop { display : none ; position : fixed ; right : 5 px ; bottom : 5 px ; }
This code positions the element in a fixed position so it always stays in the same spot .
The MooTools JavaScript
/* smoothscroll - scroll smoothly to the top*/ new SmoothScroll( {duration :500} ) ; /* go to top after 300 pixels down */ var gototop = $ ( ' gototop ' ) ; gototop.set ( ' opacity ' , '0 ' ) .setStyle( ' display ' , ' block ' ) ; window.addEvent( ' scroll ' , function(e ) { gototop.fade (( window.getScroll( ).y > 300 ) ? ' in ' : ' out ' ) } ) ;
The code is surprisingly short .
Of course we use SmoothScroll to make the transition smoothe .
You may adjust the pixel trigger amount however you 'd like .
Unfortunately the above code does n't work in IE6 .
The IE Fix
/* go to top */ var gototop = $ ( ' gototop ' ) ; gototop.set ( ' opacity ' , '0 ' ) .setStyle( ' display ' , ' block ' ) ; window.addEvent( ' scroll ' , function(e ) { if ( Browser.Engine.trident4 ) { gototop.setStyles ( { ' position ' : ' absolute ' , ' bottom ' : window.getPosition ( ).y + 10 , ' width ' : 100 } ) ; } gototop.fade (( window.getScroll( ).y > 300 ) ? ' in ' : ' out ' ) } ) ;
I like this method so much that I use it on my website .
Should n't this be a plugin ?
Do n't worry -- ScrollSpy is coming soon enough . :)
Microsoft sues TomTom
It 's believed to be the first time Microsoft has filed a patent suit over Linux , after claiming for years that elements of the open - source operating system violate its patents .
However , Microsoft says open - source software is not the intended focal point of the action .
As seen in this TechFlash article , Microsoft has launched a patent suit against TomTom , a seller of ( Linux - based ) navigation devices . "
The complaint [ PDF ] is online .
The patents involved are 6,175,789 ( Vehicle computer system with open platform ) , 7,054,745 ( Method and system for generating driving directions ) , 6,704,032 ( Methods and Arrangements for Interacting with Controllable Objects within a Graphical User Interface Environment Using Various Input Mechanisms ) , 7,117,286 ( Portable computing device - integrated appliance ) , 6,202,008 ( Vehicle computer system with wireless internet ) , 5,579,517 ( Common name space for long and short filenames ) , 5,758,352 ( Common name space for long and short filenames , again ) , and 6,256,642 ( Method and System for File System Management Using a Flash - Erasable , Programmable , Read - only Memory ) .

The morning after the Academy Awards a band of protestors gathered in Los Angeles on the corner of Main Street and Temple St outside the federal courthouse .
They were not there for the Oscars .
But one day someone will make a movie about the person they were there for .
It may be called ‘ Inherit the Wind : the Sequel . ’
The protestors were marijuana patients and medical use advocates gathering in behalf of one Charles C. Lynch ( photo below of Lynch ’s medical cannabis dispensary opening ) , who was convicted in a United States court last summer of operating a medical marijuana dispensary in violation of federal laws .
The organizers have no red carpet .
They just wanted to draw public attention to Lynch ’s case hoping that the 46 - year old man does not spend decades in prison for giving medicine to sick people .
California is one of thirteen states in which medical marijuana is legal , but federal law prohibits its use under any circumstances .
That means that though Mr. Lynch obeyed local and state laws , he nevertheless became a federal prisoner .
That means he is a victim of American injustice at its worst .
Mr. Lynch was convicted at trial , denied under the Federal Rules of Evidence from presenting any testimony whatsoever about medical marijuana , his own city business license , or the California state law he dutifully and righteously obeyed .
A jury thus only heard that some man was selling marijuana to line his pockets , and they convicted him , as a San Francisco jury once convicted Ed Rosenthal .
We had another trial like that in America .
It was called the Scopes trial , and as I recall , a schoolteacher was prosecuted for teaching science in his class and then denied the right to present testimony regarding evolution at his trial .
On February 4 , a White House Spokesman named Nick Shapiro said that President Obama did not want to waste federal law enforcement resources circumventing state medical marijuana laws .
Mr. Shapiro opined that he expected the President ’s new appointees to consider this when setting policy for their agencies .
How about having one of them show up at the sentencing for Mr. Lynch ?
How about directing the US Attorney to stand down ?
I am available if they want to send me .
Somewhere in Hollywood , a producer , watching news footage of this honorable protest , will sit in his studio , and remark , ‘ This will make a good film . ’
Years down the road , a younger version of Sean Penn will accept an Oscar for having portrayed a role about a middle aged man who started a legitimate business dispensing marijuana to sick people .
It will show him struggling to open the collective , reaching out to his consumers , helping out his neighbors , and raising his family .
Then the scene will switch to federal SWAT agents smashing down his door , arresting him and locking him up .
A US Attorney will then put him in jail for violating federal laws .
Freed years later , his community will see him as a hero and martyr , not a villain or thief .
While gay people were being beaten mindlessly in alleys for decades , someone may have said the same of Harvey Milk ’s inspirational calling in San Francisco for gay rights .
But he was not alive for the motion picture .
He was gunned down .
For Mr. Lynch and his family , there is no time for a movie tomorrow .
This is real life .
He is being gunned down today .
Unless our President does something , he is going to jail for years .
And no academy award will ever remedy that terrible injustice .

Why it 's time to break out of Twitter Thursday , March 12 , 2009 by Dave Winer .
First , so there are no misunderstandings , I am using Twitter , I will continue to use Twitter and I will recommend Twitter to others , as I have been for 2 or so years .
This is not me slamming the door on the way out , something I dislike intensely .
If you 're leaving just go .
But I 'm not leaving .
There was an event a few weeks back that convinced me that it 's time to break out , like jailbreaking an iPhone .
I do n't like the relationship Twitter - the - service has with Twitter - the - company .
Yesterday I was talking with a Twitter board member , Bijan Sabet , someone who is becoming a personal friend , and said that it was good that the phone company was n't part of the conversation .
That 's exactly how I feel about the company he is on the board of .
Yet they are very much part of the conversation .
I pour a lot of effort into Twitter , and while I was n't in the top tier of users , I was solidly in the second tier .
I was n't doing the things you have to do to get the most followers , or I did n't have a powerful media presence like Leo or Shaq to get me up there .
People like Scoble , Guy Kawasaki , Jason Calacanis all viewed being at the top as a competitive thing , so they did what it took .
Me , I just poured a lot of energy and creativity into it , and got the number of followers that comes from doing that .
It 's now approaching 20,000 , which I am proud of , but it 's not very much compared to the numbers of some people who did nothing other than be friends of Evan Williams to get hundreds of thousands of followers .
I first noticed this when I was on Ana Marie Cox 's page on Twitter .
All of a sudden she went from 3 or 4 thousand to over 60,000 in less than a week .
She had no idea why .
A thread opened , there were theories that it was a spam attack , but then Williams jumped in and said it was because she was on the Suggested Users page .
The LA Times ran a story on it , and then pretty much everyone knew .
Scoble and Leo were openly angry , understandably so .
These guys worked really hard to be at the top , I watched them do it , and now they 're not even close to the top .
( BTW , Cox is no longer in the Suggested Users list . )
I do n't have a quarrel with the people who got the boost , I think it 's pretty clear none of them asked for it .
I do think the company should have done this much more carefully .
Now there 's no way to put the toothpaste back in the tube .
And the people who got the push have a problem if they are members of the press , because this gift they got from Twitter is worth money .
It might be worth a lot of money .
If one of them posts a pointer on a Twitter account it 's going to get a lot of flow .
And what if a reporter were critical of Twitter in a piece she wrote , would Twitter revoke her status ?
TechCrunch uses their Twitter page to point to articles on their site , and every page has ads on it .
So the gift from Twitter is worth dollars to them .
It 's hard to imagine them pulling punches when it comes to reviewing the company .
But are they likely to be more kindly disposed to the company ?
It 's hard to imagine when they 're delivering so much free flow that does n't earn them a warm space in your heart .
And what about Scoble , Leo , Guy and Jason ?
Did they say something to offend Twitter ?
Possibly .
I can name one thing for each of them that the guys at Twitter probably do n't like .
But why should I have to even think about this ?
Until they tilted the table so heavily in favor of these people , I did n't .
But it always bothered me that they could .
Why does the NY Times get the gift but the LA Times does n't ?
Why is Tim O'Reilly on the list , but not Jay Rosen ?
Why TechCrunch and not GigaOm , PaidContent , SiliconAlley , ReadWriteWeb , Mashable , VentureBeat , etc etc .
Think about it this way -- do you know who wrote Apache or PHP ?
Do any of them have the power to deliver so much flow to an installation of their software ?
Imho , that 's exactly the relationship Twitter should have with its users .
Or the phone company and users of phones -- they should n't jump into a conversation and say ( for example ) " We know someone really cool you would probably like to talk to .
We 're connecting you to them now . "
Bijan says that Twitter is the little guy , but to me they look big -- huge -- when they have the power to move people up the ladder so quickly , and introduce doubt about their relationship with individual users .
When being in favor with Ev means so much .
That 's screwing the whole thing up .
Bottom - line :
This is n't the way the Internet works .
The guys at Twitter should know this .
I think they 're living in a bubble , and creating one at the same time .
No one likes someone who pops the bubble while it 's still building .
So be it .
We need to get that power out of their hands , or they need to disclaim it .
They 're such a small guy , it 's really puzzling why they would do something that alienates so many .
Most people wo n't say it , for the obvious reason that their business interests prevent them from .
Does n't mean it should n't be said .

Higher - Order Perl : nonmemoizing streams
The first version of tail ( ) in the streams chapter looks like this : sub tail { my $s = shift ; if ( is_promise ( $s - > [ 1 ] ) ) { return $s - > [ 1 ] ->( ) ; # Force promise } else { return $s - >[ 1 ] ; } }
But this is soon replaced with a version that caches the value returned by the promise : sub tail { my $s = shift ; if ( is_promise ( $s - > [ 1 ] ) ) { $s - > [ 1 ] = $s - > [ 1 ] ->( ) ; # Force and save promise } return $s - >[ 1 ] ; }
The reason that I give for this in the book is a performance reason .
It 's accompanied by an extremely bad explanation .
But I could n't do any better at the time .
There are much stronger reasons for the memoizing version , also much easier to explain .
Why use streams at all instead of the iterators of chapter 4 ?
The most important reason , which I omitted from the book , is that the streams are rewindable .
With the chapter 4 iterators , once the data comes out , there is no easy way to get it back in .
For example , suppose we want to process the next bit of data from the stream if there is a carrot coming up soon , and a different way if not .
Consider : # Chapter 4 iterators my $ data = $ iterator ->( ) ; if ( carrot_coming_soon ( $iterator ) ) { # X } else { #
Y } sub carrot_coming_soon { my $ it = shift ; my $ soon = shift || 3 ; while ( $ soon -- >
0 ) { my $ next = $ it - > ( ) ; return 1 if is_carrot ( $ next ) ; } return ; # No carrot } Well , this probably does n't work , because the carrot_coming_soon ( ) function extracts and discards the upcoming data from the iterator , including the carrot itself , and now that data is lost .
One can build a rewindable iterator : sub make_rewindable { my $ it = shift ; my @saved ; # upcoming values in LIFO order return sub { my $ action = shift || " next " ; if ( $action eq " put back " ) { push @saved , @_ ; } elsif ( $action eq " next " ) { if ( @saved ) { return pop @saved ; } else { return $ it - > ( ) ; } } } ; }
But it 's kind of a pain in the butt to use : sub carrot_coming_soon { my $ it = shift ; my $ soon = shift || 3 ; my @saved ; my $ saw_carrot ; while ( $ soon -- >
0 ) { push @saved , $ it - > ( ) ; $ saw_carrot = 1 , last if is_carrot ( $ saved [ - 1 ] ) ; } $ it ->( " put back " , @saved ) ; return $ saw_carrot ; } Because you have to explicitly restore the data you extracted .
With the streams , it 's all much easier : sub carrot_coming_soon { my $s = shift ; my $ soon = shift || 3 ; while ( $ seen -- >
0 ) { return 1 if is_carrot ( $s -> head ) ; drop ( $s ) ; } return ; } The working version of carrot_coming_soon ( ) for streams looks just like the non-working version for iterators .
But this version of carrot_coming_soon ( ) only works for memoizing streams , or for streams whose promise functions are pure .
Let 's consider a counterexample : my $ bad = filehandle_stream ( \* DATA ) ; sub filehandle_stream { my $ fh = shift ; return node ( scalar < $ fh > , promise { filehandle_stream ( $ fh ) } ) ; } __DATA__ fish dog carrot goat rectum Now consider what happens if I do this : $ carrot_soon = carrot_coming_soon ( $ bad ) ; print " A carrot appears soon after item " , head ( $ bad ) , "
" if $ carrot_soon ;
It says " A carrot appears soon after item fish " .
Fine .
That 's because $ bad is a node whose head contains " fish " .
Now let 's see what 's after the fish : print " After " , head ( $ bad ) , " is " , head ( tail ( $ bad ) ) , "
" ; This should print After fish is dog , and for the memoizing streams I used in the book , it does .
But a non-memoizing stream will print " After fish is goat rectum " .
Because tail ( $ bad ) invokes the promise function , which , since the next ( ) was not saved after carrot_coming_soon ( ) examined it , builds a new node , which reads the next item from the filehandle , which is " goat rectum " .
I wish I had explained the rewinding property of the streams in the book .
It 's one of the most significant omissions I know about .
And I wish I 'd appreciated sooner that the rewinding property only works if the tail ( ) function autosaves the tail node returned from the promise .

( CNN ) --
Officials are looking into claims that Chinese - made drywall installed in some Florida homes is emitting smelly , corrosive gases and ruining household systems such as air conditioners , the Consumer Product Safety Commission says .
Gas emitted from defective drywall corrodes copper wiring , turning it black , some Florida homeowners say .
The Florida Health Department , which is investigating whether the drywall poses any health risks , said it has received more than 140 homeowner complaints .
And class - action lawsuits allege defective drywall has caused problems in at least three states -- Florida , Louisiana and Alabama -- while some attorneys involved claim such drywall may have been used in tens of thousands of U.S. homes .
Homeowners ' lawsuits contend the drywall has caused them to suffer health problems such as headaches and sore throats and face huge repair expenses .
The drywall is alleged to have high levels of sulfur and , according to homeowners ' complaints , the sulfur - based gases smell of rotten eggs and corrode piping and wiring , causing electronics and appliances to fail .
" It 's economically devastating , and it 's emotionally devastating , " said Florida attorney Ervin A. Gonzalez , who filed one of the lawsuits .
It would cost a third of an affected home 's value to fix the dwelling , Gonzalez said .
" The interior has to be gutted , the homeowners have to continue paying mortgages , and they have to pay for a [ temporary ] place to live , " Gonzalez said .
The CPSC has been investigating claims in Florida for more than a month , according to commission spokesman Joe Martyak .
He would not confirm whether CPSC is checking other states or reveal how many cases it is probing .
The Florida complaints generally involve homes built or renovated in 2005 and 2006 , when a building boom and post - hurricane reconstruction caused a U.S. drywall shortage that spurred builders to turn to imports , Martyak said .
The allegations come after a number of recent safety problems with other Chinese exports , ranging from toys to pet food .
Dick and Nancy Nelson , who say the Florida retirement home they bought new in 2006 has Chinese - manufactured drywall , contend all their appliances with copper are failing , according to CNN affiliate WFTS - TV .
" The washing machine , the dryer , the microwave , a refrigerator -- these are all brand - new appliances , and they 're breaking down , " Nancy Nelson of Palmetto told the Tampa station .
The Nelsons are among those who have complained to the state health department .
In a neighborhood in Homestead , Florida , owners of homes with Chinese - manufactured drywall say the dwellings smell like rotten eggs , especially on humid days , according to CNN affiliate WPLG - TV .
Watch residents display corroded wiring »
Electronics and appliances with copper components stopped working in short order , and copper pipes and wiring turned black , homeowners told the Miami station .
" My dream has turned into a nightmare , " one of the homeowners , Felix Martinez , told WPLG - TV .
He said he closed on the home in August 2006 .
Michael Foreman , head of construction consulting firm Foreman & Associates in Sarasota , Florida , said he 's been investigating drywall complaints in that state since last year and is sharing information with at least one group of lawyers preparing lawsuits on the matter .
Based on shipping records , Foreman estimates the United States in 2006 and the first two months of 2007 imported enough drywall from Chinese manufacturers named in lawsuits to produce at least 50,000 homes at a size of 2,000 square feet each .
Florida ports alone took in enough of that drywall during those 14 months to build 30,000 homes of that size , he estimated , citing records he obtained from the Port Import Export Reporting Service , a company that collects information on cargoes entering and leaving U.S. ports .
Foreman said he has yet to see import records from 2004 and 2005 , years covering what he said was a building boom with a high demand for drywall .
This house in Homestead , Florida , was gutted after allegedly defective Chinese - made drywall was found there .
Two Florida attorneys involved in separate class - action lawsuits , Gonzalez and Jordan Chaikin , said they , too , believe shipping records indicate tens of thousands of residences in the United States , with a good chunk of them in Florida , may have drywall from the manufacturers .
" The breadth of this thing is a lot bigger than people think , " said Chaikin of the Parker Waichman Alonso law firm in Bonita Springs .
Chaikin said the problem is perhaps more easily recognizable in Florida because humidity exacerbates it .
An Alabama - based homebuilder alleges that Chinese - manufactured drywall in 40 houses it built in 2005 and 2006 -- 32 in Alabama and eight in Florida -- caused corrosion or odor problems .
The builder , Mitchell Co. , has filed a class - action lawsuit in Florida against certain manufacturers , attorney Steve Nicholas said .
" We filed on behalf of builders because we believe ... they 're going to be the ones with the initial loss " to fix the problems , said Nicholas , of Alabama law firm Cunningham Bounds .
In Miami , Gonzalez filed his class - action lawsuit for homeowners this month .
The suit names as defendants three China - based drywall manufacturers that the plaintiffs say are affiliates of Germany - based manufacturer Knauf Gips KG .
Knauf Gips KG was also named , along with three Florida developers and two distributors .
The Miami suit seeks compensation and medical monitoring of the homeowners .
Joerg Schanow , a member of Knauf Gips ' board , said in a telephone interview with CNN that the Chinese manufacturers named in the suit are part of Knauf Group , but not controlled by Knauf Gips KG .
" We here in Germany do not manufacture Chinese drywall .
[ Knauf Gips KG has ] never asked companies to manufacture Chinese drywall for us or on our behalf .
And there is no relationship at all , " Schanow said .
" I 'm confident we will rebut this . "
On its Web site , the company says the Knauf Group operates 150 factories worldwide , including the three Chinese production facilities named in the lawsuit .
One of the Chinese manufacturers named in the suit , Knauf Plasterboard Tianjin ( KPT ) , said in a statement released through U.S. representatives that tests by an expert toxicologist it retained found " no associated health risks with the KPT product . "
KPT is still investigating whether its product has caused any corrosion , spokeswoman Yeleny Suarez said .
In a separate statement released through KPT's U.S. representatives , lawyers said there is no basis for the other two China - based manufacturers , Knauf Plasterboard Wuhu and Knauf Plasterboard Dongguan , to be part of the lawsuit and the manufacturers " will defend themselves vigorously . "
At least two other class - action lawsuits -- one in Florida , the other in Louisiana -- name as defendants Knauf Gips , KPT and a Chinese drywall manufacturer not connected to Knauf , Taishan Gypsum Co .
In a telephone interview with CNN , a Taishan Gypsum representative said " it 's impossible that our products are found to emit poisonous gas in America , " adding that the company did n't export to the United States .
Martyak declined to say which Chinese manufacturers the CPSC is investigating .
And Foreman cautions that not all Chinese drywall manufacturers who exported to the U.S. are accused of supplying a defective product .
The Louisiana suit , filed by the Becnel Law Firm of Reserve , Louisiana , claims defective Chinese drywall was installed in a home in Pearl River .
The Louisiana Department of Health and Hospitals has received one complaint related to the drywall issue by phone , J.T. Lane , the department 's deputy chief of staff , said Wednesday .
The department is in touch with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Florida Health Department , and is " trying to determine what might be the public health impact for Louisiana and what the most appropriate response to this is , " Lane said .
CNN 's Luo Yingying contributed to this report .

I was the one who filed taxe returns for my family .
We lived in rural areas back in the days before H&R Block , and my husband was the breadwinner .
As the rules changed , it was necessary to study the instructions every year to remain current and legal .
While that may seem difficult to many , a bit of initial concentration should get one through it .
I did it with a bit less than a high school diploma at that time .
As the result of this responsibility , I became aware of the evolution over the years and can see the pattern of the changes that occurred with the many " reforms " instituted during Republican administrations .
It has always been an article of faith within the party that taxes were a nuisance that should be visited only on the private wage earners and every effort at " reform " will demonstrate their efforts to shift the burdens to the working class .
This was accomplished on the pretext of " simplifying " the reporting forms .
In fact , it is now so " simplified " that you do not even know how much your tax really is or the means by which it has been increased .
Some of these changes have been made in order to deprive the working class of exemptions and deductions , while creating new loopholes for the wealthy .
Examples :
Exemptions :
In 1949 , when I was first assigned this task , a family was allowed a personal exemption of $ 600 per year for the support of each child .
Compare that figure with the allowance this year and then compare that figure to the deflated dollar and it will be obvious that this deduction has been radically cut .
Taxes to Other Entities : Until recent times , the amount of income taxes paid to the State in which you lived was an allowable deduction as was the sales and local tax , based upon a chart which was tied to your total earnings .
You were allowed to deduct state gasoline taxes based upon the mileage readings of your automobiles .
This , alone , is a large factor in any family budget .
Interest payments :
Another large tax deduction that has been lost to the interest of " reform " is the one that allowed people to deduct payments for interest paid .
This included interest on your home , your car , credit cards , and store charges for major purchases such as furniture .
You could either include statements from your creditors or use the chart on the sliding scale .
This deduction , except in special circumstances , is now denied to the working class while businesses are still allowed to deduct it as a " cost of doing business . "
Medical Expenses :
All medical expenses , including prescription medications and medical insurance premiums were allowed in excess of 3 % of gross income .
You could also deduct any medical equipment , appliances and supplies that were prescribed by a physician and any payments for disability received from privately - or employer - paid insurance were exempt from taxation .
If your medical insurance was paid entirely by your employer , no accounting at all was necessary
I am sure that there are many other exemptions and deductions that may have existed that have quietly disappeared over the years but they do not come to mind at this time -- perhaps I never had occasion to use them -- but these alone would account for a major part of the expenditures of the average family and their restoration would greatly reduce the tax liabilities of the working class .
Where did these privileges of the working class go , and why ?
It 's simple .
In effect , these " reforms , " instituted on the pretext of simplifying the tax report , effectively increased the amounts of taxable income and thereby increased taxes on the average wage earner while preserving the privilege of the ruling class .
Even the deductions from our paychecks for Social Security reflect our second - class status .
While most of us pay the same percentage of our entire income for this purpose , those who are paid amounts beyond our wildest dreams are allowed to stop contributing .
This " cap " is possibly the only tax computation that was adjusted for inflation and then only after near - destruction of the system .
Do not listen to those calamity - criers who are bellowing for a " fair tax " which will further shift the " burden " from the backs of the wealthy , or even to those who tout a " value - added tax " which will radically increase the price of everything that we buy .
They tell us , " This would be so easy that you wo n't even realize that you are being taxed , " but what they mean is that THEY wo n't realize it because THEY will not be paying their fair share !
This is their Valhalla and what they have worked toward for all these years , the total exemption of their own class from the burden of paying for our government , for their privileges , and for any wars into which they wish to send our children .
We have recently accomplished the task of returning to the people the privilege of running our own democracy as The Founders intended but we must not relax .
We must hold that responsibility in our calloused fists and wield it wisely .
We must get on the backs of our representatives and insist that they keep our welfare and our will constantly in mind if they want to keep their jobs .
Any resistance must be met by a wall of voices , using the words of our new President , " WE WON ! "

Dish Network and some of its authorized dealers were sued Wednesday by the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) for making sales calls to people whose numbers are on the federal do - not - call registry .
Has Dish Network called you recently ?
The satellite TV provider and some of its authorized dealers were sued Wednesday by the Federal Trade Commission ( FTC ) for making sales calls to people whose numbers are on the federal do - not - call registry .
Dish , previously known as EchoStar , was also charged with violating the Telemarketing Sales Rule ( TSR ) by helping its dealers make pre-recorded " robocalls " to potential customers .
" Since the National Do Not Call Registry was launched , it has been enormously effective at protecting millions of Americans from unwanted telemarketing calls at home , " Eileen Harrington , acting director of the FTC's Bureau of Consumer Protection , said in a statement .
" But because a few bad actors still do n't get it , we want to make it crystal clear .
If you call consumers whose numbers are on the Do Not Call Registry , you 're breaking the law . "
The FTC sued in federal district court in conjunction with the attorneys general for California , Illinois , Ohio , and North Carolina .
The commission is seeking an injunction against Dish that bans it from violating the TSR .
The attorneys general also separately allege that Dish violated state telemarketing laws .
Trailer for Where the Wild Things Are , starring Max Records .
An adaptation of Maurice Sendak 's classic children 's story , where Max , a disobedient little boy sent to bed without his supper , creates his own world - - a forest inhabited by ferocious wild creatures that crown Max as their ruler .
Maurice Sendak ’s book Where the Wild things Are was published in 1963 .
Where the Wild Things
Are was originally conceived to be an animated film in the early 1980s , but the plans fell through .
Along with Spike Jonze , novelist / screenwriter David Eggers adapted the book for the big screen .
This was the third film featuring Catherine Keener that Spike Jonze directed .
The fourth was 2013's Her .
The estimated budget for the movie was about $ 100 - $ 115 million , and the family film only brought in $ 100 million worldwide , making it a loss for Warner Bros .
Maurice Sendak ’s treasured children ’s book comes alive with Spike Jonze ’s Where the Wild Things Are .
The original story was short and to the point and there was definitively not enough plot for a feature length film , so how are they going to fill those two hours ?
The trailer however puts all of those concerns at ease with what looks to be an action - packed tale of a boy who becomes the king of all the wild things .
If you remember correctly , the book tells the story of a boy sent to his room without supper , only to use his imagination as an escape to a land across days and years .
The boy , Max , ends up in a place where he was not just a little boy who was told what to do , but someone who was placed in charge by the big scary wild things who threatened to eat him up if he left because they loved him so .
Spike Jonze ’s trailer imagines so many more obstacles within the life of Max .
The film delves deeper into his school life , home life and his friendship with the wild things .
The supremely underrated Catherine Keener plays Max ’s mother , and the rest of the cast includes Mark Ruffalo , James Gandolfini and newcomer Max Records as Max .
A simple tale transformed into a coming of age story ; Spike Jonze appeals to children and the nostalgic adult alike .
One of the most beloved aspects of Maurice Sendak ’s book was the breathtaking illustrations , and as we see from the trailer , the images seem to leap from the page onto the screen creating some fantastical creatures in incredible settings to create a truly adventurous tale of a boy who imagines himself a wild thing .
Even though Congress in general seems pretty clueless on matters financial ( the Wall Street / high end variety ) , some members appear to understand the mindset .
One consequence of the ever - delayed “ buy the bad assets ” program , which clearly has to pay at or above banks ’ current marks ( otherwise they show losses , which hurts their capital bases , something that the Fed / Treasury team is keen to avoid ) is that banks have no incentive to unload that paper now .
They might as well wait to see what the sugar daddy from Washington has to offer .
From Reuters :
Global credit markets are unlikely to revive as long as the U.S. government continues to dangle the vague prospect of a toxic asset purchase plan in front of distressed banks , some lawmakers warned on Wednesday .
The chance that taxpayers could be made to overpay for underperforming assets is making bankers , whose balance sheets are saddled with them , reluctant to sell to lower bidders , suggested Texas Republican Rep. Randy Neugebauer .
“ People are afraid to buy and afraid to sell because they ’re afraid the government is going to sweeten the deal , ” he told Reuters in an interview .
“ The markets are just waiting to see when we ’re going to be done . ”
Uncertainty about the government ’s strategy for toxic assets props up their value above what private investors might pay for them and delays potential resolution of the problems they pose , said California Democratic Rep. Brad Sherman .
“ As long as there ’s the prospect the federal government will overpay for the toxic assets … these banks would be insane to sell ” in the private market , Sherman told Reuters .
“ As long as they hold the toxic assets , they have regular value , plus a politically enhanced value that you may be able to sell it to Uncle Sam for more than it ’s worth .
Why dispose of an asset where it has politically enhanced value ? ” …
Neugebauer hit on the toxic assets issue in questioning of Goldman Sachs Group Inc ’s ( GS.N ) Lloyd Blankfein and Citigroup Inc ’s ( C.N ) Vikram Pandit .
Both CEOs told Neugebauer they could sell some of the worst toxic assets on their balance sheets , but they wo n’t because the price private investors would pay is too low .
“ That low price is generated by the fear in general … and the lack of risk capital , ” Blankfein said .
Similarly , Pandit said : “ When we look at some of the assets that we hold , we have a duty to our shareholders .
The duty is that if it turns out they ’re marked so far below what our lifetime expected credit losses are , we ca n’t sell them . ”
As a junior employee at a large multinational automaker you might think that your daily tasks would revolve around sourcing the most functional ball bearing or working on a new type of door handle .
And that may be true .
But , Mercedes - Benz is looking to encourage its younger employees to think out of the box .
For over a year , 150 trainees were tasked with creating the F - Cell Roadster to further their understanding of alternative - fuel systems and afford them the opportunity to take a design concept from start to finished assembly .
Forget about those 30 inch chrome wheels you see in the music videos .
How about rolling on monster spoke bicycle tires ?
As a throwback to the 1886 Benz Patent Motor Car , the team took visual cues from this aesthetic in creating their future forward design .
The vehicle has carbon fiber seats with hand - stitched leather covers and a fiberglass body straight out of F1 .
Drive - by - wire technology is used to control the Mercedes F - Cell Roadster with a joystick taking the place of a traditional steering wheel .
An emission - free fuel cell system enclosed in an ultra cool see - through compartment in the rear allows the car to reach a top speed of a little over 15 mph with a range of 217 miles .

NSA aims to expand power : Eavesdropping agency looks to take over cybersecurity John Byrne

The spy shop that brought you the Bush administration 's warrantless wiretapping program wants to expand its power under President Barack Obama , the nation 's top intelligence chief told Congress Wednesday , in a little - noticed intelligence grab .
While acknowledging that many distrust the agency for its role in eavesdropping , Obama Director of National Intelligence Admiral Dennis Blair said he believed the agency should expand into a permanent role in handling government cybersecurity efforts .
In essence , his agency 's move is an effort to take the responsibilities away from the Homeland Security Department .
The head of Obama 's cybersecurity transition team , Paul Kurtz , said he supports giving the NSA more power in handling cybersecurity .
Blair told a House committee : " The National Security Agency has the greatest repository of cyber talent . "
" There are some wizards out there ... who can do stuff , " Blair added .
" I think that capability should be harnessed and built on . "
Some critics have questioned whether the agency is already involved in surveilling domestic e-mail and other correspondence in searching for foreign intelligence threats .
Blair said that foreign countries increasingly post a threat to the US in the cybersecurity realm .
The agency , in general , is tasked with foreign intelligence .
" A number of nations , including Russia and China , can disrupt elements of the U.S. information infrastructure , " Blair remarked .
" Cyber - defense is not a one - time fix ; it requires a continual investment . "
But he said that the NSA had " two strikes out " for its role in appearing to subvert civil liberties .
Many critics say that Bush 's wiretapping program was illegal , because taps did not go through proper court channels .
" The NSA is both intelligence and military , two strikes out in terms of the way some Americans think about a body that ought to be protecting their privacy and civil liberties , " Blair said .
" I think there is a great deal of distrust of the National Security Agency and the intelligence community in general playing a role outside of the very narrowly circumscribed role because of some of the history of the [ Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act ] issue in years past , " he continued .
" So I would like the help of people like you who have studied this closely and served on commissions , the leadership of the committee and finding a way that the American people will have confidence in the supervision . "

TO declare the Lisbon Treaty dead was an " act of treason the likes of which has not been seen since the Act of Union " , an Oireachtas subcommittee on Europe was told yesterday .
In a brief presentation that ended in a shouting match and a walk - out , Richard Greene , chairman of anti-Lisbon group Cóir , said the sole objective of the Sub - Committee on Ireland 's Future in Europe was " to attempt to overturn the democratic wishes of the majority of the Irish people who voted No " to the treaty .
The subcommittee was set up to examine the result of the Lisbon Treaty referendum and to suggest ways forward for Ireland in the aftermath of the No vote .
Mr Greene said the " brazen effrontery and blatant denial of the result shows the contempt in which the political parties hold the people .
" Suppressing the sovereign right of the people in such a fashion would be an act of treason the likes of which has not been seen since the Act of Union , " he said .
He said the treaty should be scrapped , abandoned and declared dead .
" I therefore ask the chairman to answer the only pressing matter now before this committee : will you declare the treaty dead and call on EU leaders to end the treaty ratification process immediately ? "
Committee chairman Senator Paschal Donohoe of Fine Gael said that , in the seven weeks the committee had been sitting , he had never heard such an outrageous allegation as the suggestion that anybody in the committee was perpetrating an act of treason .
Mr Greene interrupted to quote the Constitution .
" Once the people in a referendum have made a decision , the Constitution is absolutely clear that the people 's wishes have to be represented and acted upon , " he said .
" It 's appalling that democratically elected politicians would refuse to honour the Constitution . "
Mr Donohoe asked Mr Greene not to interrupt him .
But Mr Greene said he was concerned about his country , so concerned that he did n't care what people thought of him .
" You have not answered my question , " he said .
Mr Donohoe repeated that Mr Greene had alleged the committee had committed treason .
" It is not an allegation , it is the truth , " Mr Greene said .
Cóir spokeswoman Niamh Uí Bhriain asked Mr Donohoe to " respect the vote " of 862,000 people .
Mr Donohoe responded that Cóir was attempting to subvert the work of the committee .
Ms Uí Bhriain asked , " It is a simple question : will you respect the Irish vote ? "
Labour TD Joe Costello attempted to discuss the terms of reference of the committee , but was interrupted .
" I will ask you one more time to terminate what you are saying or we will adjourn this meeting , " Mr Donohoe said .
" We are not going to engage in this meaningless farce , we are going to terminate this interview , " Ms Uí Bhriain responded .
The Cóir delegation then walked out .
Afterwards , Mr Donohoe said Cóir had let themselves and their supporters down .
He said it was clear from the outset that they had no intention of taking part in any significant debate , but were only interested in grandstanding and bluster .

" A little - known island continent of floating toxic plastic garbage , TWICE the size of Texas , is growing in the pacific between Califormnia and Hawaii .
Officially known as the Great Pacific Garbage Patch , until it can be taxed , U.S. officials will continue to ignore it .
I heard of it once many years ago , but it apparently has been growing tenfold each decade since the 1950's , and now consists of 80 % plastic .
It has also been called Gilligan 's Island , from the trashy TV sitcom that wo n't go away . "
The enormous stew of trash – which consists of 80 percent plastics and weighs some 3.5 million tons , say oceanographers – floats where few people ever travel , in a no-man 's land between San Francisco and Hawaii . …
The patch has been growing , along with ocean debris worldwide , tenfold every decade since the 1950s , said Chris Parry , public education program manager with the California Coastal Commission in San Francisco .

What ?
Is Battelle crazy ?
Hear me out .
Think back when YouTube was growing like a weed , and Google snapped it up .
Most folks ( including me ) saw this as Google “ getting into the video business , ” and sure , that in fact was one part of the equation .
But as we all know , making money from consumer driven video ai n’t a cakewalk , and hosting that video is really , really expensive .
So why did Google really buy YouTube ?
My answer , which of course looks brilliant given it ’s 20/20 hindsight : YouTube was a massive search asset .
Afterall , YouTube now gets more searches than Yahoo , Google ’s closest search rival .
So think about that .
YouTube was the single fastest growing new form of search on the Web , and Google pretty much outflanked ( and outspent ) everyone to buy it .
Not to get into video monetization , per se , but to harvest and control the most important emerging form of search .
In short , Google could not afford to NOT own YouTube .
So , fast forward to today .
What ’s the most important and quickly growing form of search on the web today ?
Real time , conversational search .
And who ’s the YouTube of real time search ?
Yep .
Twitter .
It ’s an asset Google cannot afford to not own , and also , one they most likely do not have the ability ( or brand permission ) to build on their own .
( Remember , Google tried to build its own YouTube – Google Video – and it failed to get traction .
A service like Twitter is community driven , and Google has never been really great at that part of the media business ) .
That means Google most likely really , really wants to buy Twitter .
( So does Facebook , but we ’ll get to that in a second ) .
The great twist : Evan and Biz , two of the key co founders of Twitter , have already sold a company to Google ( Blogger ) and most likely are not keen to do it again .
Nor do they have to , given their recent funding and the money they made from pre-IPO Google options .
Add in the fact that Twitter has already said no to a $ 500 mm offer from Facebook , and the fact that Facebook has responded quickly with by opening up its Live Feed status API , and we ’ve got a very interesting year ahead of us in the Internet biz .
I ’ll be watching closely .
( PS – Much speculation lately that Twitter is a threat to Google , see this Merc piece .
I ’ll respond more to that idea later ) .
Update : Plenty of folks letting me know of pieces that are related , will post them as the come in .

Last week , I got to play Xbox 360 on the world 's largest , highest resolution screen .
At 11 feet tall and 120 feet long , it was ridiculous .
It made Panasonic 's 150 - inch plasma look like a toy .

I was lucky enough to be invited on as a guest on CollegeHumor 's video game show , Bleep Bloop .
Apparently , after extensive work , uh , " testing " Panasonic 's 103 - inch and 150 - inch plasma screens , I 'm somewhat of an expert on playing video games on ludicrously large monitors .
Badass .

Click to viewAccording to the folks at IAC , who house this monstrosity in their headquarters ' lobby , it 's the largest , highest - definition screen in the world .
That is to say there are larger screens with lower resolution and smaller screens with higher resolution , but this bad boy has the highest combo of both specs .
Yes , it is large .

Unfortunately , due to it being 120 feet long , it has a ridiculous aspect ratio that 's not designed for regular things like TV or video games , instead acting as a strange art space most of the time .
Because of this , we could only use one chunk of the screen .
I was told , however , that they have the ability to hook up multiple Xboxes at once , possibly linking them together side by side for some sort of epic multiplayer showdown .
I want very much to make that dream a reality , but that 's for another day .

Mahoney and I got an opportunity to go behind the wall and check it out , and it's a crazy setup .
It has 21 projectors aimed at 42 mirrors .
The projectors are actually aimed away from the screen , bouncing down and back off of two mirrors each to combine to fill up the massive screen .
As for playing on the screen , it was pretty killer .
Obviously , playing video games on large screens is really fun .
But in all honesty , it gets to a point where you are n't even really paying attention to the large screen anymore .
You know , it 's only a novelty for so long , and then you 're just focusing on not falling off the damned buildings anymore in Mirror 's Edge .
I guess you can get used to anything .

What huge screens like this are really great for is split - screen gaming .
If we had played Call of Duty 4 on this thing , for example , all four players would have the equivalent of a 134 - inch TV to stare at .
But really , a screen like this is n't even an option for anyone other than Barry Diller to use on any type of real basis , but if you ever get an opportunity to spend an afternoon dicking around with one , you wo n't want to skip it .
Trust me .
Thanks to John Mahoney for taking pictures and to Jeff Rubin and Pat Cassels for having me on Bleep Bloop !

A Queen 's - led team has discovered the reason why garlic is so good for us .
Researchers have widely believed that the organic compound , allicin – which gives garlic its aroma and flavour – acts as the world 's most powerful antioxidant .
But until now it has n't been clear how allicin works , or how it stacks up compared to more common antioxidants such as Vitamin E and coenzyme Q10 , which stop the damaging effects of radicals .
" We did n't understand how garlic could contain such an efficient antioxidant , since it did n't have a substantial amount of the types of compounds usually responsible for high antioxidant activity in plants , such as the flavanoids found in green tea or grapes , " says Chemistry professor Derek Pratt , who led the study .
" If allicin was indeed responsible for this activity in garlic , we wanted to find out how it worked . "
The research team questioned the ability of allicin to trap damaging radicals so effectively , and considered the possibility that a decomposition product of allicin may instead be responsible .
Through experiments with synthetically - produced allicin , they found that an acid produced when the compound decomposes rapidly reacts with radicals .
Their findings are published in the January 2009 issue of the international chemistry journal Angewandte Chemie .
" Basically the allicin compound has to decompose in order to generate a potent antioxidant , " explains Dr. Pratt , who is Canada Research Chair in Free Radical Chemistry .
" The reaction between the sulfenic acid and radicals is as fast as it can get , limited only by the time it takes for the two molecules to come into contact .
No one has ever seen compounds , natural or synthetic , react this quickly as antioxidants . "
The researcher is confident that a link exists between the reactivity of the sulfenic acid and the medicinal benefits of garlic .
" While garlic has been used as a herbal medicine for centuries and there are many garlic supplements on the market , until now there has been no convincing explanation as to why garlic is beneficial , " says Dr. Pratt .
" I think we have taken the first step in uncovering a fundamental chemical mechanism which may explain garlic 's medicinal benefits . "
Along with onions , leeks and shallots , garlic is a species in the family Alliaceae .
All of these other plants contain a compound that is very similar to allicin , but they do not have the same medicinal properties .
Dr. Pratt and his colleagues believe that this is due to a slower rate of decomposition of the allicin analogs in the onions , leaks and shallots , which leads to a lower level of sulfenic acid available to react as antioxidants with radicals .
The study was funded by the Natural Sciences and Engineering Research Council of Canada ( NSERC ) and the Ontario Ministry of Innovation .
Other members of the research team are Queen 's Chemistry post - doctoral researcher Vipraja Vaidya and Keith Ingold , from the National Research Council of Canada .

People across England and Wales will be able to access details of crime levels and trends in their local communities from today , under a government initiative .
The Neighbourhood crime maps provide a picture of crime in specific police force areas , allowing members of the public to see the volume of crime as well as trends and comparisons with the rest of the country .
The Home Office claims the maps will also allow people to see how local crime fighting partnerships are impacting on the issues of local concern and will give people the information needed to dictate local priorities .
The types of crime shown on the maps include burglary , robbery , theft , vehicle crime , violent crime and anti-social behaviour .
Announcing the launch of the scheme on Tuesday , Home Office minister Vernon Coaker said : " I am determined to give people the crime information which , as the Casey Review found , they want .
" Every single police force in England and Wales now has crime mapping .
This gives comprehensive knowledge about crime patterns and hotspots to communities .
" By empowering people with this information they are able to engage more with their neighbourhood policing teams .
I am sure this will lead to an even more responsive and effective police , thoroughly in tune with people 's needs . "
Mr Coaker added crime mapping would now ensure the public 's opinions were heard when police forces set their priorities for tackling crime .
Neil Rhodes , the Association of Chief Police Officers ( ACPO ) lead on crime mapping , added that police forces across the country would " continue to work hard to provide the public with the very best information , with more facts , to help them understand what is happening in their area and reassure them of what is being done to make them safer " .
But the Liberal Democrats said the maps needed to indicate how efforts to cut crime were progressing .
" Crime maps should include local detection rates - the key factor in deterring crime - so we can give praise or criticism where it is due , " said the party 's home affairs spokesman Chris Huhne .
The second to last day allocated by the State Canvassing Board for the review of challenged ballots started today at 9 AM CT .
The proceedings can be watched at the Minnesota House of Representatives Website ( as shown below ) or at TheUpTake.org .
[ The third session has ended , but a replay is available : Part 1 , Part 2 , Part 3 , Part 4 ]
Yesterday the Board examined 415 total ballots , predominately from the Franken pile , and ruled as follows , according to the StarTribune :
Candidate Challenges -> Coleman -> Franken ->
Other Coleman ( R ) 20 7 ( 35.0 % ) 7 ( 35.0 % ) 6 ( 30.0 % ) Franken ( D ) 391 225 ( 57.5 % ) 56 ( 14.3 % ) 110 ( 28.1 % ) Unknown 4 0 ( 00.0 % ) 0 ( 00.0 % ) 0 ( 00.0 % ) Total 415 232 ( 55.9 % ) 63 ( 15.2 % ) 116 ( 28.0 % )
TheUpTake.org arrived at the same total of 415 , but their intermediate numbers differ slightly :
238 awarded to Coleman 63 awarded to Franken 114 awarded to " Other "
The day seemingly belonged to Democrat , Al Franken .
Roughly 15 % of Franken 's challenges were for himself ; I find it unlikely that Coleman will reach a similar threshold , but we wo n't know until the results are in .
Today , the board will review , or start to review approximately 1,017 Coleman challenges .
If Coleman 's challenges follow the same trend as Franken 's ( using Star Tribune data ) , the following result seems possible , if not probable :
Candidate Gain from Coleman Challenges Net Challenge Gain Coleman 1016 * ( 14.3 % ) = 145.2 232 + 145.2 = 377.2 Franken 1016 * ( 57.5 % ) = 584.2 63 + 584.2 = 647.2 Other 1016 * ( 28.1 % ) = 285.5 116 + 285.5 = 401.5 Total 1016 Franken + 270
The Star Tribune arrived at " Franken by 275 , " and that includes the thousands of withdrawals issued by each campaign ; a fact the above calculation ignores .
So if Franken gains in the ballpark of 270 votes from the challenges , where does that leave the count ?
There is still the issue of the mistakenly rejected absentee ballots place in the " fifth pile . "
According to the Star Tribune , with 51 of 87 counties having completed their review of absentee ballots , 721 remain in the " fifth pile . "
If Franken does in fact gain the 270 votes from the challenges , he will overcome the current 188 vote deficit and take an 82 vote lead .
This may explain why the Coleman campaign has taken a sudden interest in the double ballot counting issue .
They released the following statement yesterday on the topic :
If the founders had wanted some people to have their vote counted once and other people to have their votes counted twice it would have been in the Constitution .
Unfortunately for the Franken campaign the case law in this matter is quite clear : Double - counting votes violates the concept of " one person , one vote . "
The Franken campaign 's refusal to correct errors in which the same voter 's originally cast ballot , and a duplicate ballot made election night because the original was inadvertently damaged , will create an inaccurate count .
It would be an aberration and a corruption of the Constitution to allow for a new standard to be applied to double - count votes just because the Franken campaign is asking for it to be done .

The canvassing board , yesterday , allowed each campaign to make their case regarding this topic .
The board essentially decided that this is not an issue they will look into , at the moment , and suggested that a court would be the proper place to take of the claim .
They may address the issue again today , however .
The board also hinted at the possibility of releasing data this morning , but that does not appear to be the case , at least so far .
Perhaps they will address this issue too .
Current Challenge Resolution Count ( from TheUpTake.org ) :
9:00 AM CT : Meeting started ; 208 additional challenges from the Coleman campaign .
Lunch from 12:30 to 2:00 PM CT .
They will handle these additional challenges on December 30th .
9:06 AM CT : The first three ballots were withdrawn with 2 being allocated to Franken and 1 to Other .
9:07 AM CT : They are apparently placing " incident report " challenges in a blue folder for later review .
9:09 AM CT : First actual challenge , goes to nobody ; an undervote .
9:17 AM CT : Coleman +238 , Franken +72 , Other + 116 ( After 426 Challenges )
9:27 AM CT : Coleman +238 , Franken +79 , Other + 118 ( After 435 Challenges )
9:38 AM CT : " Lizard People " ballot ruled an overvote .
9:39 AM CT : Coleman +238 , Franken +96 , Other + 120 ( After 453 Challenges )
9:40 AM CT : After 38 challenges , Coleman has not gained a vote .
9:43 AM CT : " Flying Spaghetti Monster " ballot ruled a vote for Franken .
9:56 AM CT : Coleman +238 , Franken + 127 , Other + 122 ( After 486 Challenges )
10:16 AM CT : Coleman +240 , Franken + 147 , Other + 130 ( After 518 Challenges )
10:38 AM CT : Coleman +243 , Franken + 151 , Other + 133 ( After 527 Challenges )
10:49 AM CT : Coleman +243 , Franken + 153 , Other +138 ( After 534 Challenges )
11:05 AM CT : Coleman +244 , Franken + 165 , Other + 141 ( After 549 Challenges )
12:07 PM CT : Coleman +248 , Franken +245 , Other +155 ( After 648 Challenges )
5:12 PM CT : Coleman +253 , Franken +432 , Other +198 ( After 883 Challenges )

5 . Trim your cell phone costs
Advertisement
The economy stinks for you , but it really stinks for providers of services that can easily be scaled back — like cell phone providers .
On the one hand , they may fight harder to keep you paying for data plans , text messages , and other " value added " items , but they really , truly do n't want to lose you as a customer .
If you can't re-negotiate a better deal , though , take a tip from PC Magazine columnist Sascha Segan and cut your phone bill by actually jumping ship ( to a pay - as - you - go phone ) , then let them come crawling back with a package pitch .

4 . Invest in your career
Financial guru Warren Buffett , as he so often does , said it best back in April , before the market fell :
Unless you 're going to make investment analysis a nearly full - time gig , you 're better off spending your discretionary time in furthering your main career and honing your skills than surrounded by earnings reports and endlessly changing charts .
It 's the same reasoning SmartMoney 's Jack Hough uses in explaining why renting might make more sense than buying , especially if you 're not partial to putting work , time , and money into a place right now .
Neither is a call to yank all your hard investments out and start a blacksmith shop ( as appealing as some might find the idea ) , but they reason that the revenue - generating asset you might have the most control over is your career .

Curbing spending , like cutting back on calories , is something any self - help - ish expert can and will tell you to do , with few details given .
So you 're left , just as with dieting , to come up with your tricks and techniques for teaching yourself to do and not do certain things .
When it comes to tricking yourself into saving money , we like the kind that you do n't need much to start out doing , like Merlin Mann 's Crap I Just Do n't Need .
txt file , in which he captures all his do - wants and must - haves , as if it were a wish list , but ends up checking it every so often to see just how well he 's gotten along without all those things .

2 . Get serious about Craigslist
Advertisement
Craigslist is a website built for an economy that 's scaling back to basics .
People looking for extra cash divest themselves of stuff they do n't really need , and those who need to spend less snatch up their stuff .
If you 're on either side , it helps to have the right tools .
Get savvy with your selling by digesting Adam 's seller 's guide to Craigslist , and on the flip side with our Craigslist tips for power users .
Hone down on exactly what you 're looking for ( time is money , after all ) with the previously mentioned Craigslist Image Preview extension , or the image mashup MyWiseBunny.com ( formerly CLHack.com ) .
It can feel harsh grabbing up deals when you know times are tough , but to many sellers , the buyer who actually pays is worth more than some future ideal of better times .

TOKYO ( Reuters ) - Japan ’s public pension fund , the world ’s largest , reported on Friday a record 5.7 trillion yen ( 45.1 billion pounds ) loss on its investments in October - December , hit by a surge in the yen and stock market declines .
It was the Government Pension Investment Fund 's GPIF.L biggest quarterly loss since it started investing in markets in 2001 .
The GPIF said the return on its investments dropped to negative 6.09 percent during the quarter , as the financial crisis took a turn for the worse after the collapse of U.S. investment bank Lehman Brothers in September rocked global markets .
For the nine months that ended in December , the GPIF posted an 8.67 trillion yen loss on its investments , or a negative 9.13 percent return , on track for a second straight year of losses .
In the year to March 2008 , it posted a negative return on its investments for the first time in five years with a 5.84 trillion yen loss , or a return of minus 6.41 percent .
The yen surged after the collapse of Lehman and hit a 13 - ½ year high of 87.10 against the dollar last month , though it has since weakened to near 98 versus the U.S. currency as investors fret about Japan ’s deepening recession .
Tokyo's Nikkei stock average .
N225 fell around 42 percent in 2008 , the biggest loss in its 58 - year history .
The yen ’s strength hit the GPIF ’s holdings in foreign securities , with foreign stocks producing a negative return of 41.3 percent and foreign bonds posting a minus 12.1 percent return in the April - December period .
The rate of return on the GPIF ’s investments in Japanese stocks was minus 29 percent during the nine months .
Japanese government bonds outperformed other assets with a positive return of 2.1 percent during the period .
The fund holds nearly 140 trillion yen in total assets .
As of the end of December , the GPIF had about 90.4 trillion yen invested in markets .
The GPIF held a total 26.2 trillion yen worth of Zaito agency bonds issued by semi-governmental agencies that it holds to maturity .
The rest of its assets are in loans to semi-governmental entities and other public entities being paid back to the GPIF .
Of the total excluding the portion of loans to be returned , it had 75.9 percent in domestic bonds , including Zaito bonds , 9.46 percent in Japanese stocks , 7.82 percent in foreign bonds and 6.66 percent in foreign stocks .
Background
Senket is a board game I invented several years ago .
My goal was to come up with rules as simple as possible , but game play as deep as possible .
Go was my inspiration .
The rules of Go are very simple , but there are several complexities :
The ko rule can be confusing for beginners , especially since it is implemented / described in several different ways .
Snapbacks have to be distinguished from kos .
The concept of life and death — simplified , that two eyes live and one eye dies — is so fundamental to the game that , while not part of the rules , no description of how to play is complete without it .
Seki further complicates the issue .
There are different methods of scoring , although they are nearly equivalent .
That said ,
Go has perhaps the deepest strategy of any board game ever , and certainly the highest ratio of game depth to rule complexity of any game I know .
Senket ’s rules are even simpler than Go’s , as you ’ll see below .
There is only one type of move , with no special cases .
Nothing is ever removed from the board , or moved once placed .
At the end of the game , territory is simply defined .
The question of depth of strategy remains open .
From a sheer numbers standpoint , Senket is more complex than most other games , but just because the board is bigger does n’t necessarily mean much .
In gameplay , Senket seems deeper than Checkers , and perhaps as deep as Chess , but until / unless world - class games of Senket are played , it is impossible to say .
Description
Senket is played on a grid .
Grids as small as 11×11 will work , but 17 ×17 makes for a reasonable game , and 31×31 is the official size .
The goal is to surround more territory with your fences than your opponent .
The overall concept is similar to Go .
The mechanics of game play are similar to Twixt .
Rules
Players take turns making moves .
A move consists of placing a post on any unoccupied intersection of the grid ( including the borders ) , and then making as many valid fences as you wish .
A fence connects two same - color posts across an open diagonal of a 1×2 rectangle .
Once placed , posts and fences cannot be moved or removed .
Play continues until both players pass .
Scoring
Territory is any region of the board your fences surround that does not contain any territory of your opponent .
At the end of the game each player ’s score is the sum of the values of each separate territory .
Each territory ’s value is the square of the sum of :
The area the territory ’s fences surround ( see below for examples ) .
The number of opposing posts captured within the territory .
Scoring does not take place until the end of the game .
You can play inside your opponent ’s territory if you think you can make territory there .
How to Move
In this diagram , all the blue fences are valid .
All the red fences are invalid :
None of the red fences in the upper right are 1×2 diagonals .
The red fence in the lower left does not connect two posts .
The two red fences in the lower right are crossed ; whichever was drawn second is incorrect .
The red fence in the bottom center connects a red post and a blue post .
No Forced Moves
A fence does not have to be drawn just because it can be .
The lone blue post on the left can connect to either of the two posts above it .
The blue player will decide whether to connect this post on a future move or not .
Usually there is no reason not to connect all posts that can be , but there are a few specific circumstances where it is beneficial ( or even necessary ) not to draw all possible fences .
Scoring Example
This diagram shows a completed game , with each player ’s territory shaded in his color .
The area in the lower right marked in yellow is not Blue ’s territory .
Even though Blue surrounds it , the red territory inside it makes the area inside the blue fence but outside the red fence neutral .
It counts for neither player .
The blue post in the upper left magenta territory counts as a prisoner for Red .
The blue and red posts in the yellow area are not prisoners , and count for no one .
Red scores :
Upper left area : 27
Upper left prisoners : 1
Upper left value : ( 27 + 1 ) ^2 = 28^2 = 784
Lower left area : 10
Lower left value : 10^2 = 100
Lower right area : 2
Lower right value : 2^2 = 4
Total score : 784 + 100 + 4 = 888
Blue ’s areas are connected .
Blue scores :
Upper right area : 19
Lower left area : 12
Total score : ( 19 + 12 ) ^2 = 961
Red actually surrounded more territory and prisoners ( 40 to 31 ) but Blue connected his territory and won .
Basic Strategy
It ’s easier to make territory in the corners , but it ’s also important to connect your territory .
As shown in the example above , Red took much more territory , but lost because Blue connected and he did n’t .
On larger boards this is even more important .
Consider the value of different available moves .
As play winds down in one location , there will probably be bigger plays elsewhere that offer a larger reward .
This is a careful balancing act that continues throughout the game .
Senket is not a kill - or - be - killed game ( as compared to Chess or Checkers ) .
Every game will likely end with both sides securing at least some territory , so look for advantageous ways to divide territory being contested , rather than a way to take your opponent prisoner , unless that ’s a real possibility .
Think “ how can I get more out of this than my opponent ? ” rather than “ how can I destroy my opponent ? ”
I ’ll follow up with examples as I prepare them for the web .
At the same time , federal law links many important perquisites to marital status , including Social Security survivor benefits , tax - free inheritance , spousal immigration rights and protections against mutual incrimination .
All of these benefits are currently denied to same - sex couples , even those living in states that permit same - sex marriage or civil unions .
But these same benefits could be conferred by federally recognized civil unions .
Yes , most gays are opposed to the idea that religious organizations could openly treat same - sex couples and opposite - sex couples differently , without fear of being penalized by the government .
But we believe that gays can live with such exemptions without much difficulty .
Why ?
Because most state laws that protect gays from discrimination already include some religious exemptions , and those provisions are for the most part uncontroversial , even among gays .
And while most Americans who favor keeping marriage as it has customarily been would prefer no legal recognition of same - sex unions at either the federal or the state level , we believe that they can live with federal civil unions  provided that no religious groups are forced to accept them as marriages .
Many of these people may come to see civil unions as a compassionate compromise .
For example , a PBS poll last fall found that 58 percent of white evangelicals under age 30 favor some form of legal same - sex union .
Linking federal civil unions to guarantees of religious freedom seems a natural way to give the two sides something they would greatly value while heading off a long - term , take - no - prisoners conflict .
That should appeal to cooler heads on both sides , and it also ought to appeal to President Obama , who opposes same - sex marriage but has endorsed federal civil unions .
A successful template already exists : laws that protect religious conscience in matters pertaining to abortion .
These statutes allow Catholic hospitals to refuse to provide abortions , for example .
If religious exemptions can be made to work for as vexed a moral issue as abortion , same - sex marriage should be manageable , once reasonable people of good will put their heads together .
In all sharp moral disagreements , maximalism is the constant temptation .
People dig in , positions harden and we tend to convince ourselves that our opponents are not only wrong - headed but also malicious and acting in bad faith .
In such conflicts , it can seem not only difficult , but also wrong , to compromise on a core belief .
But clinging to extremes can also be quite dangerous .
In the case of gay marriage , a scorched - earth debate , pitting what some regard as nonnegotiable religious freedom against what others regard as a nonnegotiable human right , would do great harm to our civil society .
When a reasonable accommodation on a tough issue seems possible , both sides should have the courage to explore it .

Felicia Barton Replaces Joanna Pacitti on American Idol
Felicia Barton
“ It has been determined that Joanna Pacitti is ineligible to continue in the competition , ” FOX said in a statement released Wednesday night .
“ American Idol contestant Felicia Barton has replaced Ms. Pacitti as part of the Top 36 . ”
, 26 , will be replacingin American Idol 's Top 36 , after Pacitti was booted from the competition .
Pacitti was disqualified after being told on Wednesday night she would be returning for the next round .
Pacitti's eligibility has been called into question since it was learned she had previous record deals , including the release of an album with Geffen Records , and the single " Let It Slide " with A&M Records , as well as close relationships with two executives of 19 Management , the production company behind Idol .
Pacitti lived in the same apartment building as 19's Michelle Young and Roger Widynowski , even referring to the former exec as her " best friend . "
Both Barton and Pacitti audtioned in Louisville , KY .
Barton lives in Virginia Beach with her husband and son .

STOCKHOLM —
The third day of The Pirate Bay trial began in a packed courtroom , and ended with both sides meeting each other at an Italian restaurant by chance .
Unlike U.S. trials , civil and criminal cases are sometimes merged in Sweden .
That 's the case in the trial of the Pirate Bay , and on Wednesday the government prosecutor took a seat to allow the entertainment industry to begin presenting cases against four defendants associated with the defiant filesharing site .
Fredrik Neij , Gottfrid Svartholm Warg , Peter Sunde and Carl Lundström face up to two years in prison each , in addition to fines as high as $ 180,000 , for alleged contributory copyright infringement .
Not surprisingly , some of Sweden 's top lawyers are involved in the high - profile case , although it was not until Wednesday that we really heard from them .
Peter Danowsky , the recording industry lawyer , began by putting The Pirate Bay 's bad attitude on trial .
He brandished a printout from the website disclosing the Pirate Bay 's complaints policy : " All potential complaints from copyright persons and / or lobby organizations will be ridiculed and flaunted on the site . "
The defense pointed out that this was not evidence that the Pirate Bay intended to facilitate copyright infringement , and drew the court 's attention to the preceding paragraph : " Members of the Pirate Bay represents a broad filesharing public .
Hence material you may find offensive might be available ....
The only occasion that The Pirate Bay will remove torrents is if the name does not conform with the contents .
People should know what they download " .
The day was mostly used for arguing " losses . "
Danowsky claimed that his clients must be compensated , and that the loss should be computed as if each download would have been purchased at the full price that record companies charge .
In addition , he argued , a penalty for damaging the whole industry should be added to the defendants ' bill : The Pirate Bay undermines music CD profits , because downloading is simpler than running out to the record store .
The torrent site also undermines lawful online sales channels , and make it more difficult to develop new services , he claimed .
Finally , he argued that rights holders that had not released their material online should enjoy higher compensation , since pre-release piracy undermines future online sales .
This particularly applied to Let it Be by the Beatles , whose music has not been legitimately available as a download .
Danowsky demanded that 130 euro be paid to EMI for each time the album was downloaded through a torrent listed on the Pirate Bay .
On the defense side , a lawyer for 48 - year - old Carl Lundström was the most aggressive Wednesday .
Lundström is the odd man among the defendants .
As heir to the Swedish Wasa Bread empire , he 's an independently wealthy and slightly eccentric business man .
His detractors point to a past in nationalist politics .
Lundström is named in the case because he owned an ISP from which two other Pirate Bay defendants purchased co-location and bandwidth .
Attorney Per Samuelsson , one of Lundström 's two lawyers , claimed that his client had nothing to do with running The Pirate Bay , and that he should not be in court .
But he also argued that the case is not even close to the copyright infringement matter the prosecutor claims .
It should be thrown out , he said , as a matter of law .
MPA lawyer Monique Wadsted speaks to reporters after Wednesday 's court proceedings .
Photo : Oscar SwartzAssuming the case is not thrown out in its entirety , he continued , to convict Lundström , the prosecutor must prove that his specific acts contributed in a direct manner to concrete infringements — which for Lundström is ridiculous .
Moreover , under Swedish law an intermediary internet service provider is specifically protected from liability when their users perform illegal acts — something that should protect all the defendants .
The prosecution should go after the people uploading the content instead .
" And you know who they are , " Samuelsson said .
" You have shown us screenshots .
They have usernames like King Kong and may be anywhere in the world .
Those are the guys you should go after ! "
The bench in the District Court of Stockholm consists of one professional judge and three lay judges , appointed by the political parties that have seats in the local council .
They represent the public and need not have any legal education .
The median age among lay judges is 57 in the country .
Here we have one white - haired woman with a brooch , one older man with very pronounced white hair and one slightly younger man who takes notes on his laptop .
The general opinion among courtroom spectators , who mostly support The Pirate Bay , is that the tide has already turned against the prosecutor and the plaintiffs .
In the first two days the prosecutor 's flat presentation of infringed works was so uninspired that a satirical blog promised to release a CD of it as a sleeping aid .
More than one of the lay judges seemed to have difficulty keeping their eyes open during parts of the presentation .
And at one point in Wednesday 's proceedings , the professional judge asked the prosecutor and plaintiffs if they would accept an intermediate acquittal for the charges that were dropped Tuesday .
They did not object .
But after the court adjourned , Monique Wadsted , the Motion Picture Association 's lawyer , expressed confidence in her case .
She said that the partial acquittal would not affect a damage award .
That 's assuming the defendants are convicted , of course .
Because the trial combines civil and criminal cases , an acquittal on the criminal charges would mean the civil plaintiffs get nothing , according to tort law professor Mårten Schultz of Stockholm University .
When the courtroom drama and press conferences were over , I was invited to join three of the defendants ( all but Lundström ) for lunch , along with a documentary filmmaker who has followed the Pirate Bay crew for months .
They had difficulties agreeing on a lunch spot , because Peter Sunde is a vegan , while Fredrik Neij is the opposite and adamantly refused a proposed Japanese restaurant , claiming that " anything that smells like fish is out of the question .
I need real meat " .
They finally settled on an Italian place , and high spirits restored , Neij began discussing his economic prospects .
He was told he will get a tax - free cash grant from the state for each day he has to appear in court .
" Wow , that 's much more than I have ever kept as an employed technician ! " he said .
Peter Sunde ( left ) and Fredrik Neij at lunch , trailed by documentary filmmaker .

The more organized Sunde sighed .
" Gottfrid !
The proceedings were adjourned until tomorrow .
Do n't you ever listen ? "
At that moment , Danowsky , the MPA 's Monique Wadsted and all the other hard - hitting content - industry lawyers and their assistants sauntered right into the same Italian eatery .
It could have been a tense moment , but the Pirate boys cracked jokes with them , and the lawyers responded with good humor .
You would n't know that they 'd been on opposite sides in the courtroom less than an hour ago , or that earlier in the week Wadsted was waging a public relations war on the group .
One Wadsted statement in particular made headlines here .
Taking on Pirate Bay's Robin Hood image , Wadsted claimed that the prevailing opinion among Swedish teenagers is that filesharing is wrong .
" They have been very skilled in romanticizing the picture of themselves , " Wadsted claimed .
" They have a small , dedicated group around them but apart from those there are very few who knows or even cares about who they are . "
And as the Pirate Bay crew finished lunch and got up to leave , a young waiter pointed to Sunde and shouted : " We are with them ! "
I was recently contacted by Packt Publishing , and asked if I wanted to review a book they published – Object - Oriented JavaScript , written by Stoyan Stefanov .
I had n’t reviewed books before , but I decided to give it a shot !
As stated on Packt ’s website , by reading the book you will learn :
Create scalable , reusable high - quality JavaScript applications and libraries Learn to think in JavaScript , the language of the web browser
Object - oriented programming made accessible and understandable to web developers
Do it yourself : experiment with examples that can be used in your own scripts
Write better , more maintainable JavaScript code
It also says :
After reading this book , you ’ll be prepared to ace your JavaScript job interview and even impress with some bits that the interviewer maybe did n’t know .
You should read this book if you want to be able to take your JavaScript skills to a new level of sophistication .
which would definitely be a benefit , do n’t you think so ?
Does the book deliver all this ?
The contents
The book is divided into 8 chapters , four of which deal with the basic features of the JavaScript language , and the other four dive deeper into the language and the actual object - orientation parts like inheritance and design patterns .
The book uses Firebug as the main “ development environment ” , which I think is a good thing .
Firebug is an important tool for a JavaScript programmer , and it works quite well for the task of teaching and learning too .
The book uses tip boxes , which contain best practices , common mistakes or other useful information , and the code samples in the book are consistent in style and display use of good practices .
Each chapter also contains exercises in the end , which help you to learn the concepts introduced in the chapter .
The JavaScript basics
The first chapter begins by looking a bit into what JavaScript is :
Where it came from , where it is now and also a bit about the future .
It serves as a nice look into the language ’s roots .
It also introduces JavaScript and OOP concepts , and compares them with other languages .
Next , in the second chapter , the book looks more into JavaScript ’s types , expressions and constructs .
Everything is explained thoroughly , and using language that even beginner programmers should understand .
It even explains terminology for words like “ operator ” and “ operand ” , so even if you ’re not familiar with these terms – for example if english is n’t your native language – you wo n’t have any problems with the upcoming chapters .
It also explains more obscure syntax like the exponential “ 2e - 5 ” and special values NaN , Infinity and others .
The third chapter is all about JavaScript functions , again starting with basics , terminology and explaining things very thoroughly .
It goes into more detail and more complex examples about functions too : anonymous functions , inner functions , etc .
As an added bonus , this chapter looks into some common JavaScript built in functions .
Chapter four introduces objects , which have been refered to a bit earlier in the book as well .
As usual , it ’s very clear and everything is explained well .
It talks about how JavaScript ’s object oriented features differ from other languages and provides some examples which are useful if you ’re familiar with some “ classical ” OOP language .
Like with the previous chapter , this one also shows you how to use built in JavaScript objects such as Number and Date .
More in - depth
The fifth chapter talks about the prototype property .
You can read most of this chapter online here at my blog .
There ’s a bit more towards the end of the chapter which is n’t included in the post , though .
This chapter is one of the most useful parts in the book for readers who are more experienced in JavaScript .
Chapter six is again a chapter looking deeper into JavaScript : inheritance .
It explains various inheritance styles possible in JavaScript , such as prototype chaining and pseudo - classical inheritance .
Also talks a bit about Yahoo !
UI Framework and the Prototype library .
The seventh chapter is dedicated to the browser :
The browser object model and the document object model .
It covers cross browser compatible features of the BOM and DOM , like working with DOM nodes and using XMLHttpRequest .
It also talks about the event model used in the browser , and some help on how to make things work in IE .
It does not go into very great detail , but serves as a good primer to working with the browser ’s features .
The final chapter looks into coding and design patterns .
This one covers common things you see in modern JavaScript code , such as namespaces and initialization patterns .
It also shows how to achieve public and private functions , and chaining , which is very common in jQuery .
This chapter is very good , especially as many frameworks like Dojo and YUI use JavaScript in ways which can be confusing to beginners , but after reading this , you should understand them quite well .
Appendixes
The book also has four appendixes : A list of JavaScript reserved words , a list of builtin functions with examples , a list of objects with examples and a JavaScript regex syntax index .
Good things
The book is very thorough in explaining how JavaScript works .
The first four chapters make the book suitable even for those who have n’t never used JavaScript before .
They also contain some tidbits which more experienced programmers might not know about .
The last four chapters make the book useful for people who are familiar with JS , and even those who are quite experienced in it can gain some new insights , for example about the prototype property or inheritance .
To highlight some good parts :
The first chapter shows a Firefox “ strict ” JavaScript parsing mode I did not know about
The third chapter explains “ self executing function ” syntax , ( function ( ) { … } ) ( ) ; , which used to confuse me a lot some years back
The chapters on prototypes , inheritance and patterns are excellent , and they had various small things I did n’t know about
Bad things
It ’s difficult to find bad things about this book .
Maybe the fact that I only have it as a PDF ?
There were some small places for improvement , though .
In the second chapter it might have been a good idea to mention that lazy evaluation in conditionals is also known as “ short circuiting ” .
Also , the third chapter code examples displaying inner and outer functions used f( ) and n( ) as the function names .
It would probably have been a little better to use descriptive naming like outer ( ) and inner ( ) , so you would n’t have to look at the code example to see which one is which .
If you want to learn more about Ajax or DHTML - style tricks , this book may not be for you .
While the browser environment chapter is good as an introduction , and you can definitely start using JavaScript on websites based on it , it does n’t go into more advanced things .
The bottom line
To go back to the initial question , “ does the book deliver ? ” , the answer is definitely yes .
The book delivers all it promises , and after reading it , you will be able to impress interviewers .
All in all , the book is a great read for anyone who wants to learn JavaScript , or improve their existing skills in the language .
The book is most useful for beginner to intermediate level JavaScripters , but may also contain some useful things if you ’re more experienced .
New programmers start using Python and wxPython each week .
So it follows that every few months , I see people asking how to redirect stdout to a wx .
TextCtrl on comp.lang .
python or the wxPython mailing list .
Since this is such a common question , I thought I would write an article about it .
Regular readers will know that I have mentioned this concept before in a previous post .
Updated 2015-10-06
Originally I thought we ’d need to create a class that can duck - type the writing API of a wx .
TextCtrl .
Notice that I use the so - called “ new style ” class that subclasses object ( see code below ) .
class RedirectText ( object ) : def __init__( self , aWxTextCtrl ) : self.out=aWxTextCtrl def write ( self , string ) : self.out .
WriteText ( string )
Note that there ’s only one method in this class ( besides the initialization method , of course ) .
It allows us to write the text from stdout or stderr to the text control .
It should be noted that the write method is not thread - safe .
If you want to redirect text from threads , then change the write statement like this :
def write ( self , string ) : wx.CallAfter(self.out .
WriteText , string )
Now let ’s dig into the wxPython code we ’ll need :
import sys import wx class MyForm ( wx . Frame ) : def __init__( self ) : wx.Frame.__init__(self , None , wx .ID_ANY , " wxPython Redirect Tutorial " ) #
Add a panel so it looks the correct on all platforms panel = wx .
Panel ( self , wx. ID_ANY ) log = wx.
TextCtrl ( panel , wx. ID_ANY , size = ( 300,100 ) , style = wx .
TE_MULTILINE|wx.TE_READONLY|wx.HSCROLL ) btn = wx .
Button ( panel , wx .
ID_ANY , ' Push me !' ) self .
Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON , self.onButton , btn ) #
Add widgets to a sizer sizer = wx.BoxSizer( wx.VERTICAL ) sizer .
Add(log , 1 , wx.ALL|wx.EXPAND , 5 ) sizer .
Add( btn , 0 , wx.ALL|wx.CENTER , 5 ) panel.SetSizer( sizer ) # redirect text here redir= RedirectText ( log ) sys.stdout=redir def onButton ( self , event ) : print " You pressed the button ! " #
Run the program if __name__ == " __main__ " : app = wx .
App( False ) frame = MyForm ( ) .
Show ( ) app.MainLoop ()
In the code above , I create a read - only multi- line text control and a button whose sole purpose is to print some text to stdout .
I add them to a BoxSizer to keep the widgets from stacking on top of each other and to better handle resizing of the frame .
Next I instantiate the RedirectText class by passing it an instance of my text control .
Finally , I set stdout to the RediectText instance , redir ( i.e. sys.stdout=redir ) .
If you want to redirect stderr as well , then just add the following right after “ sys.stdout=redir ” : sys.stderr=redir
Improvements could be made to this , namely color coding ( or pre-pending ) which messages are from stdout and which are from stderr , but I ’ll leave that as an exercise for the reader .
Recently it was pointed out to me that I should n’t need to jump through all these hoops .
Instead , you can just redirect stdout directly to the TextCtrl widget because it has its very own write method .
So here ’s an example :
import sys import wx class MyForm ( wx . Frame ) : def __init__( self ) : wx.Frame.__init__(self , None , title= " wxPython Redirect Tutorial " ) #
Add a panel so it looks the correct on all platforms panel = wx .
Panel ( self , wx. ID_ANY ) style = wx .
TE_MULTILINE|wx.TE_READONLY|wx.HSCROLL
log = wx.
TextCtrl( panel , wx. ID_ANY , size = ( 300,100 ) , style=style ) btn = wx .
Button ( panel , wx .
ID_ANY , ' Push me !' ) self .
Bind(wx.EVT_BUTTON , self.onButton , btn ) #
Add widgets to a sizer sizer = wx.BoxSizer( wx.VERTICAL ) sizer .
Add(log , 1 , wx.ALL|wx.EXPAND , 5 ) sizer .
Add( btn , 0 , wx.ALL|wx.CENTER , 5 ) panel.SetSizer( sizer ) # redirect text here sys.stdout=log def onButton ( self , event ) : print " You pressed the button ! " #
Run the program if __name__ == " __main__ " : app = wx .
App( False ) frame = MyForm ( ) .
Show ( ) app.MainLoop ()
You will note that the code above no longer references the RedirectText class because we do n’t need it .
I am pretty sure that if you want to use threads , doing it this way will not be thread - safe .
You ’ll need to override the TextCtrl ’s write method in a similar manner as was previously mentioned to make it safe .
Special thanks goes to carandraug for pointing this out to me .

The New York Times has published an article that perpetuates the propaganda of anti-gay organizations , falsely accusing supporters of marriage equality of harassment and intimidation .
Brad Stone ’s article , which appeared in the Business section , is full of hyperbole and inflammatory generalizations that are not worthy for print .
In their article they say " For the backers of Proposition 8 , the state ballot measure to stop single - sex couples from marrying in California , victory has been soured by the ugly specter of intimidation .
Some donors to groups supporting the measure have received death threats and envelopes containing a powdery white substance , and their businesses have been boycotted .
The targets of this harassment blame a controversial and provocative Web site , eightmaps.com "
This is n’t journalism .
It is anti-gay propaganda .
The vast majority of marriage equality supporters are decent , law abiding citizens .
No arrests have been made in connection with the isolated incident involving the alleged mailing of a white powdery substance to Prop 8 supporters .
There have been no arrests of marriage equality supporters for death threats or acts of intimidation .
The article also perpetuates the notion that boycotts are somehow equivalent to harassment .
How does one harass a business owner by taking his or her business elsewhere ?
This kind of propaganda and political scapegoating is nothing new .
It was used by those who opposed desegregation of schools and businesses in the 1950s and ’60s .
Those who participated in boycotts and protests were blamed for numerous social ills and accused of intimidation .

House Bill 656 , introduced in the Missouri House of Representatives on February 10 , 2009 , and not yet referred to a committee , is the latest antievolution " academic freedom " bill .
The bill would , if enacted , call on state and local education administrators to " endeavor to create an environment within public elementary and secondary schools that encourages students to explore scientific questions , learn about scientific evidence , develop critical thinking skills , and respond appropriately and respectfully to differences of opinion about controversial issues , including such subjects as the teaching of biological and chemical evolution , " and to " endeavor to assist teachers to find more effective ways to present the science curriculum where it addresses scientific controversies . "
" Toward this end , " the bill continues , " teachers shall be permitted to help students understand , analyze , critique , and review in an objective manner the scientific strengths and scientific weaknesses of theories of biological and chemical evolution . "
A predecessor , HB 2554 from the 2008 legislative session , attempted to immunize itself from the accusation of unconstitutionality by saying , " This section only protects the teaching of scientific information and this section shall not be construed to promote any religious or nonreligious doctrine , promote discrimination for or against a particular set of religious beliefs or nonbeliefs , or promote discrimination for or against religion or nonreligion . "
However , HB 656 is interestingly specific , saying , " This section only protects the teaching of scientific information and this section shall not be construed to promote philosophical naturalism or biblical theology , promote natural cause or intelligent cause , promote undirected change or purposeful design , promote atheistic or theistic belief , promote discrimination for or against a particular set of religious beliefs or ideas , or promote discrimination for or against religion or nonreligion .
Scientific information includes physical evidence and logical inferences based upon evidence . "
The chief sponsor of HB 656 is Robert Wayne Cooper ( R - District 155 ) , joined by Mike Sutherland ( R- District 99 ) , Ed Emery ( R - District 126 ) , Therese Sander ( R- District 22 ) , Brian Nieves ( R- District 98 ) , and Stanley Cox ( R - District 118 ) .
Cooper was the sponsor of numerous failed antievolution bills in the past .
In 2008 , he introduced the similar HB 2554 .
In 2006 , he introduced HB 1266 , which if enacted would have required that " If a theory or hypothesis of biological origins is taught , a critical analysis of such theory or hypothesis shall be taught in a substantive amount . "
In 2004 , he introduced two bills , HB 911 and HB 1722 , that called for equal time for " intelligent design " in Missouri 's public schools .
HB 911 moreover contained idiosyncratic definitions of various scientific and philosophical terms as well as the draconian provision , " Willful neglect of any elementary or secondary school superintendent , principal , or teacher to observe and carry out the requirements of this section shall be cause for termination of his or her contract .

On Thursday , January 8 , 2009 , US President - elect Barack Obama said ,
I do n't believe it 's too late to change course , but it will be if we do n't take dramatic action as soon as possible .
If nothing is done , this recession could linger for years .
Most economists and various commentators are in agreement .
They hold that the US government must sharply increase its spending in order to arrest the economic crisis that could turn into a prolonged slump .
According to the Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) , in the absence of a stimulus plan , the unemployment rate could jump to above 9 % by early 2010 .
Some other experts are of the view that without the stimulus plan the unemployment rate could easily surpass the 10 % mark .
Most experts hold that on account of the economic slump and the consequent underutilization of resources , economic output in the next two years will be strongly below the potential output .
For 2009 and 2010 , the production loss is estimated to be in excess of $ 2 trillion ( the gap between the potential GDP and the actual GDP ) .
Therefore they believe that the effective way to close the gap between the potential output and the actual output is through the fiscal stimulus package — a large increase in government outlays .
Given the possibility that the gap could exceed the $ 2 trillion mark it seems that the Obama 's fiscal stimulus plan of around $ 800 billion is not going to " do the trick . "
Even if one were to allow for the so - called " multiplier effect , " Obama 's plan will not close the output gap and thus " fix " the problem , so it is held .
In Obama 's plan , only about $ 480 billion consists of public spending , which has a multiplier of around 1.5 .
( That is , a dollar of government expenditure supposedly raises GDP by around $ 1.5 . )
The rest of the package consists of tax cuts , which most experts do n't believe would boost spending and thus activate the multiplier .
This way of thinking follows the ideas of John Maynard Keynes .
In a nutshell , Keynes held that one cannot have complete trust in a market economy , which is inherently unstable .
If left free , the market economy could lead to self - destruction .
Hence there is the need for governments and central banks to manage the economy .
Successful management , in the Keynesian framework , is done by influencing the overall spending in an economy .
It is spending that generates income .
Spending by one individual becomes income for another individual .
" The government does n't create any real wealth , so how can an increase in government outlays revive the economy ? "
What drives the economy then is spending .
If during a recession consumers fail to spend , then it is the role of the government to step in and boost overall spending in order to grow the economy .
In the Keynesian framework , an output that an economy could generate without causing inflation , given a certain pool of resources — i.e. , labor , tools , and machinery , and a given technology — is labeled potential output .
Hence the greater the pool of resources , all other things being equal , the more output can be generated .
If , for whatever reasons , the demand for the produced goods is not strong enough , this leads to an economic slump .
( Inadequate demand for goods leads to only a partial use of existent labor and capital goods . )
In this framework then , it makes a lot of sense to boost government spending in order to strengthen demand and eliminate the economic slump .
What is missing in this story is the matter of funding .
For instance , a baker produces ten loaves of bread and exchanges them for a pair of shoes with a shoemaker .
In this example , the baker funds the purchase of shoes by producing ten loaves of bread .
Note that the bread maintains the shoemaker 's life and well - being .
Likewise , the shoemaker has funded the purchase of bread by means of shoes that maintain the baker 's life and well - being .
Now , the baker has decided to build another oven in order to increase the production of bread .
In order to implement his plan , the baker hires the services of the oven maker .
He pays the oven maker with some of the bread he is producing .
Again , what we have here is a setup where the building of the oven is funded by the production of a final consumer good — bread .
If , for whatever reasons , the flow of bread production were disrupted , the baker would not be able to pay the oven maker .
As a result , the making of the oven would have to be aborted .
From this simple example we can infer that what matters for economic growth is not just the existing stock of tools and machinery and the pool of labor but the adequate flow of final goods and services that maintains individuals ' lives and well - being .
Now , even if we were to accept the Keynesian framework that the potential output is above the actual output , it does n't follow that the increase in government outlays will lead to an increase in the economy 's actual output .
It is not possible to lift overall production without the necessary support from final goods and services or from the flow of real funding or the flow of real savings .
( For instance , out of the production of ten loaves of bread , if the baker consumes two loaves , his real saving or real funding is eight loaves . )
We have seen that by means of a final consumer good — the bread — the baker was able to fund the expansion of his production structure .
Similarly , other producers must have final , saved , real consumer goods — real savings — to fund the purchase of goods and services they require .
Note that the introduction of money does n't alter the essence of what funding is .
( Money is just a medium of exchange .
It is only used to facilitate the flow of goods ; it cannot replace the final consumer goods . )
The government as such does n't create any real wealth , so how can an increase in government outlays revive the economy ?
Various individuals who will be employed by the government will expect compensation for their work .
The only way it can pay these individuals is by taxing others who are still generating real wealth .
By doing this , the government weakens the wealth - generating process and undermines prospects for economic recovery .
( We ignore here borrowings from foreigners . )
The only way fiscal stimulus could " work " is if the flow of real savings ( i.e. , real funding ) is large enough to support ( i.e. , fund ) government activities while still permitting a positive rate of growth in the activities of the private sector .
( Note that the overall increase in real economic activity is , in this case , erroneously attributed to the government 's loose fiscal policy . )
If , however , the flow of real savings is not large enough , then , regardless of any increase in government outlays , overall real economic activity cannot be revived .
In this case the more government spends ( i.e. , the more it takes from wealth generators ) , the more it weakens prospects for a recovery .
Thus when government , by means of taxes , diverts bread to its own activities , the baker will have less bread at his disposal .
Consequently , the baker will not be able to secure the services of the oven maker .
As a result , it will not be possible to boost the production of bread , all other things being equal .
As the pace of government spending increases , a situation could emerge where the baker will not have enough bread even to maintain the existing oven .
( The baker will not have enough bread to pay for the services of an oven - maintenance technician . )
Consequently , his production of bread will actually decline .
Similarly , other wealth generators , as a result of the increase in government outlays , will have less real funding at their disposal .
This , in turn , will hamper the production of their goods and services , thereby retarding , not promoting , overall real economic growth .
As one can see , not only does the increase in government outlays not raise overall output by a positive multiple ; but , on the contrary , this leads to the weakening in the process of wealth generation in general .
According to Ludwig von Mises ,
“ The start of 2009 marks a big change for the American role in Iraq , ” said Keith Porter in About.com .
Under a “ status of forces ” agreement that went into effect Jan. 1 , the U.S. handed control of Iraqi airspace and the fortified Green Zone to the government of Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki .
Maliki proposed that Jan. 1 be commemorated as a new national holiday , “ Sovereignty Day . ”
This “ welcome restoration of sovereignty ” is “ a defining moment in the long and bloody struggle ” to bring stability to Iraq , said The Times of London in an editorial .
For Americans and “ a skeptical Muslim world , ” it is a “ confirmation that democracy is , at last , taking root ” in Iraq ; for Iraqis it is “ of huge psychological importance in restoring national pride . ”
Implausible as it may have seemed just two years ago , “ the end of Iraq ’s agony is now in sight . ”
The war in Iraq as we know it “ is indeed over , ” said Anthony Shadid in The Washington Post , but that ’s “ not to say that there is peace in Iraq . ”
The daily death toll is as high as in 2003 and 2004 , and any mention of “ victory ” to a local is met with “ a dumbfounded look . ”
This handover feels most like the “ lifting of a siege , ” or “ more truce than treaty . ”
And the key question — how strong is the central government ?—is still to be decided in the upcoming political war .
Anne Thomas
Manes wrote an obituary for SOA , claiming that
SOA met its demise on January 1 , 2009 , when it was wiped out by the catastrophic impact of the economic recession .
SOA is survived by its offspring : mashups , BPM , SaaS , Cloud Computing , and all other architectural approaches that depend on “ services ”
She continues :
Once thought to be the savior of IT , SOA instead turned into a great failed experiment — at least for most organizations .
SOA was supposed to reduce costs and increase agility on a massive scale .
Except in rare situations , SOA has failed to deliver its promised benefits .
After investing millions , IT systems are no better than before .
In many organizations , things are worse : costs are higher , projects take longer , and systems are more fragile than ever .
The people holding the purse strings have had enough .
With the tight budgets of 2009 , most organizations have cut funding for their SOA initiatives .
Although SOA was initially adopted mostly by technicians , at its root it is more business then technical problem .
But as it was introduced ( and often executed ) by technical people and product vendors , which were more interested in SOA technologies ( software sales ) then its business impact :
People forgot what SOA stands for .
They were too wrapped up in silly technology debates ( e.g. , “ what ’s the best ESB ? ” or “ WS -* vs. REST ” ) , and they missed the important stuff : architecture .
An inability to show a quick ROI turned many business decision makers away from SOA :
SOA fatigue has turned into SOA disillusionment .
Business people no longer believe that SOA will deliver spectacular benefits .
“ SOA ” has become a bad word .
It must be removed from our vocabulary .
This means a huge setback for IT industry :
The demise of SOA is tragic for the IT industry .
Organizations desperately need to make architectural improvements to their application portfolios .
Service - orientation is a prerequisite for rapid integration of data and business processes ; it enables situational development models , such as mashups ; and it ’s the foundational architecture for SaaS and cloud computing .
So what is next ?
According to Anne :
Although the word “ SOA ” is dead , the requirement for service - oriented architecture is stronger than ever .
Her suggestion is to stop talking about SOA and start talking about services ( although she is n't clear about her definition of this term , thus leaving room for interpretation and misinterpretation ) .
The post has quite obviously stirred up reactions among some of the thought leaders in this space .
David Linthicum analyzed what when wrong , to paraphrase
Lack of skilled architects who understand SOA .
Big consulting firms focusing more on tactics and billable hours than results
The vendors focused too much on selling and not enough on the solution .
Hype that SOA is a panacea to all IT woes
Joe McKendrick observes that SOA is a style of architecture and not a product :
Successful SOA is part of a transformative process that changes the way organizations are managed and do business .
And some organizations just seem to “ get it ” right away .
For many companies , however , what they may see as SOA is more JBOWS ( Just a Bunch of Web Services ) architecture .
SOA is a methodology and philosophy .
The mix of technologies and approaches employed to work toward SOA will shift .
A few years ago , Web services was seen as the way , yesterday it was REST and Web or Enterprise 2.0 , and now it ’s cloud computing .
The beauty of SOA is that it is meant to be independent of the underlying technologies or protocols .
Miko Matsumura supports
Anne ’s suggestion to change terminology , but stresses the fact that the notion of SOA , and especially business dimension of SOA will certainly survive :
I believe that use of SOA as a term will certainly decline , but the strategies to address the fundamental problems will have to continue to evolve out of the SOA “ stream ” .
At the same time SOA is dead , SOA is also inevitable – but it may come under a different name .
The DNA of large organizations will require interfaces to appropriately segment the what of requirements from the how of implementation , and the design patterns of SOA will be the ones that will realize the long term vision of an Enterprise , Multi-Enterprise , and indeed “ cloud ” platform .
Any term like SOA has to experience the hype cycle and goes through linguistic mystique , implementation , experimentation , and eventually a degree of nomenclature fatigue .
SOA had a particularly “ big tent ” agenda and so a lot of folks latched on to it in the hopes that SOA would be their savior .
Frankly I see the same kind of pattern in “ cloud ” , which is to say that it ’s not an easily defined technical term , rather a set of political interested tied to a set of insights and realizations .
He also cautions against over reaction , which is so common in IT recent history :
Fear about the economy should take a back seat to the project of becoming the change we need .
The era of knee - jerk emotional reaction can hopefully be relegated to 2008 ( or perhaps the first half of 2009 ) and we can move forward together to both re-envision and rebuild our infrastructure .
And to realize the big vision we need each and every person to become the change we need .
Steve Jones interprets
Anne ’s statement as :
Vendors are moving away from SOA as they 've flogged you enough stuff and now they want to flog you its offspring : mashups , BPM , SaaS , Cloud Computing …
The reality is that it is in fact the services that matter more at this stage than at any other .
This does n't mean that SOA is dead , it means that the marketing fury of T - SOA has moved on as their just are n't that many more ESBs and Web Service tools that you can be sold .
What remains is in fact what SOA was all along its Services are the starting point for SOA its not those pretty technologies …
If you adopt the new technologies without having a services mentality then you will create a degree of mess that will make the one that consultants and vendors got fat on with EAI look like a trivial problem .
Doing Spaghetti inside your firewall in big applications is one thing , doing it over the internet and with thousands of small ones is a completely different scale of problem .
Steve then elaborates on definition of service , promoting “ business first ” approach and defining them as a functionality that can be exposed for use by others :
… you need to Identify your services , understand the business value that they deliver , understand the cost model to deliver that value and then decide on the right technology approach .
Nick Gall , on another hand , disagrees with Anne ’s way forward ( " long live services " ) :
It is services thinking , as conventionally understood , that led to the mess in which we find ourselves : fragmentation caused by entity - specific ( service ) interfaces .
I 'd say instead , " long live the web . "
I 'm shocked that Anne 's blog post does not even mention the web !
He cites successes of Google , Amazon , and even Salesforce and attribute them , for the most part to the leveraging of web architecture , web community , and web business models : " Web- orientation is a prerequisite for rapid integration of data and business processes ; it enables situational development models , such as mashups ; and it's the foundational architecture for SaaS and cloud computing .
And finally in a similar view , a blast from the past 2005 prediction from Don Box , which though not related to this discussion , seems to suggest the same :
The term SOA will have been beaten to death and the software industry will invent or recycle some equally vague term to replace it .
Be sure to check out Annes original post .
It seems quite obvious that changing a name will probably not fix current SOA problems , but one can argue that refocusing on the architecture and business aspects of SOA will .
What do you think ?
Is SOA dead , or alive and kicking ?
Installing Metasploit 3.0 On Ubuntu 7.10
The Metasploit Project is an open source computer security project which provides information about security vulnerabilities and aids in penetration testing and IDS signature development .
Its most well - known sub-project is the Metasploit Framework , a tool for developing and executing exploit code against a remote target machine .
Other important sub- projects include the Opcode Database , shellcode archive , and security research .
( Wikipedia ) .
Installing Metasploit
Before installing metasploit we need to install the following packages :
$ sudo apt - get install ruby libruby rdoc
$ sudo apt - get install libyaml - ruby
$ sudo apt - get install libzlib - ruby
$ sudo apt - get install libopenssl - ruby
$ sudo apt - get install libdl - ruby
$ sudo apt - get install libreadline - ruby
$ sudo apt - get install libiconv-ruby
$ sudo apt - get install rubygems
Once the dependencies have been installed , we are ready to install metasploit .
We now need to download the metasploit 3.0 .
Use the following link for download :
http://framework.metasploit.com/msf/downloader/?id=framework-3.0.tar.gz
Accept the license .
The location ( for download ) is not important .
After the download is complete we need to untar it :
$ tar -xvzf framework - 3.0.tar.gz
Updating Metasploit
Before we run metasploit , its a good idea to update its database .
Change to metasploit folder :
$ cd metasploit-3.0
Update :
$ svn update
Note : in case you do n't have subversion installed use the following command :
$ sudo apt - get install subversion
Running Metasploit
To run metasploit use the following command :

Over the past 24 hours , Apple has begun to approve 3rd party web browsing applications for the iPhone .
A number of new web browsing apps have suddenly appeared with original submission dates ranging as far back as October .
While Apple has made no official acknowledgements , it appears these applications were likely in a special queue awaiting for approval .
We had seen a similar " group " delays with other categories of apps .
The most notable example involved flatulence applications such as Pull My Finger and iFart Mobile .
Once Apple decided to allow the category within the App Store , a backlog of apps quickly appeared .
Web browsing applications were previously charged with " duplicating functionality " of other iPhone apps and was felt to be the reason why Opera would never be approved by Apple .
A partial list of these new applications include :
- Edge Browser ( Free ) -
No loss of screen real estate to the address or navigation bars .
- Incognito ( $ 1.99 ) - Now you can browse without leaving a history of any kind .
- WebMate : Tabbed Browser ( $ 0.99 ) - Web
Mate simplifies browsing by queuing up all the links you click on , then allowing you to view them one by one when you 're ready .
- Shaking Web ( $ 1.99 ) - adds a sophisticated algorithm to compensate for small hand shaking to allow for easier reading .
This could open the door for mobile versions of prominent web browsers such as Opera and Firefox , though there remain other SDK restrictions that could prevent full - featured versions of those browsers from appearing .
Still , Apple appears to be loosening some early restrictions they had applied to the App Store approval process .
WHY HOME - SCHOOL ?
WHY HOME - SCHOOL ?
Top reasons cited by parents ( could pick more than one ) : • Concerns about the school environment ( including safety , drugs , peer pressure ) : 88 % • A desire to provide religious or moral instruction : 83 % • A dissatisfaction with instruction at other schools : 73 % • An interest in a non-traditional approach : 65 % Source : Top home - schooling reasons in 2007 Parent and Family Involvement in Education Survey
The ranks of America 's home - schooled children have continued a steady climb over the past five years , and new research suggests broader reasons for the appeal .
The number of home - schooled kids hit 1.5 million in 2007 , up 74 % from when the Department of Education 's National Center for Education Statistics started keeping track in 1999 , and up 36 % since 2003 .
The percentage of the school - age population that was home - schooled increased from 2.2 % in 2003 to 2.9 % in 2007 .
" There 's no reason to believe it would not keep going up , " says Gail Mulligan , a statistician at the center .
Traditionally , the biggest motivations for parents to teach their children at home have been moral or religious reasons , and that remains a top pick when parents are asked to explain their choice .
The 2003 survey gave parents six reasons to pick as their motivation .
( They could choose more than one . )
The 2007 survey added a seventh : an interest in a " non-traditional approach , " a reference to parents dubbed " unschoolers , " who regard standard curriculum methods and standardized testing as counterproductive to a quality education .
" We wanted to identify the parents who are part of the ' unschooling ' movement , " Mulligan says .
The " unschooling " group is viewed by educators as a subset of home - schoolers , who generally follow standard curriculum and grading systems .
" Unschoolers " create their own systems .
The category of " other reasons " rose to 32 % in 2007 from 20 % in 2003 and included family time and finances .
That suggests the demographics are expanding beyond conservative Christian groups , says Robert Kunzman , an associate professor at Indiana University 's School of Education .
Anecdotal evidence indicates many parents want their kids to learn at their own pace , he says .
Fewer home - schoolers were enrolled part time in traditional schools to study subjects their parents lack knowledge to teach .
Eighteen percent were enrolled part time in 1999 and 2003 , compared with 16 % in 2007 .
Kunzman says this might be because of the availability of online instruction .
The 2007 estimates are based on data from the Parent and Family Involvement in Education Survey of the National Household Education Surveys .
Brian Ray , president of the National Home Education Research Institute , says the estimates are low because home - schooling parents " are significantly less likely to answer government - sponsored surveys . "

This is part of my RPG series of entries here at SOB .
See the inaugural entry in the series for more details .
Lost in the mists of time is the Second Edition of Advanced Dungeons and Dragons .
AD&D 2E was the edition of the game that immediately ( by which I mean “ by about a decade or so ” ) preceded Third Edition Dungeons and Dragons .
Back in those days , Armor Class was a number that was better when it was lower , ranging from 9 ( if you had no armor ) downward .
One could have a negative AC , and that was a really good thing to have .
Spike Page at Ubiquitous Orcs asks Descending Armor Class …. Does ANYBODY still use it ?
The most important question asked there , I think , is not the query in the title .
Rather , it ’s an implied question .
Spike says :
Now I normally consider myself to be just weird enough that I can actually find the bizarre logic behind just about anything , no matter how silly .. but this one has me stumped .
Perhaps descending AC is legacy rules from some old mothbally tactical historical game that TSR wrote back when TSR used to write such things .. or maybe somebody wanted to make the math unnecessarily complicated so that non-nerds would shrink back in fear upon encountering such esoteric arithmatic .
But far be it from me to pontificate about which method of AC numbering is “ right ” and which is n’t .
I certainly do n’t mean to say anybody out there needs to change if they prefer the descending method … but I am genuninely curious as to why .
The implied question , then , is something like this :
What ’s up with descending AC ?
Most people ( including Spike , probably ) , I think , would assume that the implied question is more like this :
Why do people use a difficult , math - heavy system of descending AC ?
That version of the question assumes some things that simply are n’t true , though .
The THAC0 system used in 2E is n’t any more difficult and math - heavy than the ascending system used in 3E .
The problem is n’t THAC0 ; it ’s the way THAC0 was explained in the books , and the fact that for some reason it seems like almost nobody ever noticed how easy it really is to use .
I ’m not really sure why it was n’t figured out by more people , many of whom are quite intelligent ( they ’re gamers , after all ) .
What follows is a brief description of how you use the ascending AC from 3E .
player : I attack the orc .
I rolled a 12 .
With my +5 Base Attack Bonus , that comes out to 17 .
DM : ( checks orc stats , finds that this orc has an AC of 16 ) That hits .
Roll damage .
Next , I ’ll provide an example of how most people used THAC0 in 2E , because this is how the 2E Player ’s Handbook told them to do it .
player : I attack the orc .
I rolled a 12 .
My THAC0 is 15 .
DM : ( checks orc stats , finds that this orc has an AC of 4 , opens the PHB , finds that with a THAC0 of 15 , it takes an 11 to hit the orc , forgets what the player said he rolled )
I ’m sorry — please remind me what you rolled .
player : 12 . DM : Oh .
That hits .
Roll damage .
Finally , I ’ll provide an example of how THAC0 should be used in 2E .
player : I attack the orc .
I rolled a 12 .
My THAC0 is 15 .
DM : ( checks orc stats , finds that this orc has an AC of 4 , adds that to the roll of 12 for a total of 16 , which is higher than the 15 THAC0 )
That hits .
Roll damage .
See , the key is that descending AC is n’t a target number , nor is it a means of finding a target number on a chart , as most people thought .
No , it ’s a modifier to the roll .
The target number is the THAC0 .
It ’s really that simple .
All that having been said , though , I still prefer an ascending AC .
I just do n’t see that it ’s really all that big a deal .
The GURPS system , with its target numbers you have to roll under , is a real pain in the ass , though .

COMBINED LOCKS , Wis. —
A Wisconsin police chief has agreed to let his officers shock him with an electronic stun gun to raise money for the Special Olympics .
Police Chief Steven Wulgaert says he ’s the only one of his five full - time and five part - time officers who has n’t been shocked during training .
He says he took some ribbing about this before telling the officers they could shock him if they raised $ 500 for the charity .
Officer Duane Dissen says the department has raised about $ 800 so far and hopes to collect $ 2,500 .
Dissen says Wulgaert will earn the money when he gets shocked before the Combined Locks Village Board meeting Tuesday .
Dissen says the pain goes “ from your fingertips right down to your toes . ”
Wulgaert plans to retire March 1 .
College Students Build Hydrogen Fuel Cell Motorcycle
February 2nd , 2009 by Ariel Schwartz
[ social_buttons ]
Lots of college students complete a thesis or final project , but few can claim to have finished something as impressive as the hydrogen fuel cell motorcycle built by Swarthmore College seniors Alex Bell and Andres Pacheco .
The enterprising duo built the motorcycle in an attempt to evaluate the viability of a hydrogen economy by studying real - world data — specifically , by testing the efficacy of hydrogen fuel cells , internal combustion , and battery propulsion .
Bell and Pacheco began working on an electric car during their freshman year , but the idea eventually faded away .
The pair have been working on a hydrogen fuel cell motorcycle since last summer .
Funding for the project was provided by the Swarthmore Engineering Department and the Halpern Family Fund for Student Design .
Bell and Pacheco estimate that the motorcycle has an average efficiency of 50 percent .
After averaging in losses in propulsion , total vehicle efficiency is expected to be 46 percent .
“ We got it to work the day before winter break , and now we ’re just working on data acquisition problems [ with the motorcycle ’s LCD screen ] , ” Pacheco said .
“ We also had a problem with the motorcycle ’s controller because we could n’t take it to max power .
But it works — we ’re just trying to get bits and pieces together so we can have trial runs and analyze data , ” Pacheco said .
Despite having invested so much time in a hydrogen fuel cell vehicle , Bell and Pacheco are unsure of the short - term prospects for a hydrogen economy .
“ It looks like HFC propulsion and infrastructure will be extremely costly and probably wo n’t be the preferred option , at least in the near future .
However , because of the zero-emissions aspect of HFCs , it is likely they will at least be more widely used in the long - term future , ” Pacheco said .
Pacheco and Bell are currently applying to graduate school engineering programs , but readers are welcome to contact the pair with employment offers .

Latest Cleantech Talk Episode
Most Internet marketers make money online , most musician marketers do n’t .
The Backstory – The Big Seminar
My journey into the world of Internet marketing , began when I attended an Internet marketing conference and saw one of the keynote speakers .
Armand is a bubbly and enthusiastic man from South Carolina ; he makes a fortune in the world of internet marketing , and he not only markets things that help him make money , he teaches people how to do it themselves .
Armand is also a musician and his alter ego is Micheal Lee Austin .
When I saw him speak , he walked us through how he took took himself to the top of the Billboard charts using his own online marketing strategy .
He sold thousands of CD ’s using his own techniques .
I was so intrigued I wanted to learn how he did it , so I signed up to study with him via a series of online courses and they came with a ticket to his “ Big seminar ” in Atlanta .
The big seminar completely shifted my reality .
I went to Atlanta not knowing what to expect , I came home with my world rocked .
At lunch on the first day , I struck sat next to an unassuming man , and we struck up a non-memorable conversation .
Two guys approached him and began slapping him on the back and congratulated him on breaking the $ 1 M mark so far that year , ( and there were still many months left in that year . )
I was amazed .
How was this marketer making millions while most of my clients were making what seemed like less every year ?
The answer is effectively applying marketing strategies .
In this new age of blasting messages out on Myspace and Facebook , we have completely taken our energy away from traditional marketing .
Our focus has been diluted with a new online service that seem to crop up everyday to help musicians with everything from cross-posting show dates , to tuning your guitar with your cell phone .
Many of these developments , are wonderful , but all of them take time and energy to learn and implement , and they take us away from focusing on traditional Internet marketing .
Selling Music is Not Like Selling A Diet Product
The act of selling music is not at all like selling goods or services which is where Internet Marketers have a leg up on musicians .
You are ostensibly selling a feeling .
People connect to music in a very different way than they connect to any old product , but that does n’t mean that we ca n’t take the same basic principles and apply them .
Here are the ones that I highly suggest .
What ’s In The Internet Marketers Arsenal
1. EMAIL LIST MANAGEMENT SYSTEM :
Internet Marketer ’s Strategy : Build a mailing list and communicate regularly adding value .
Goal :
Get your list to interact with you and trust you , track how effective you are being by looking at open rates
Product : e-mail list manager .
You need an email list manager that measures results .
There are many available I suggest Reverb Nation ’s free system or BandLetter .
www.ReverbNation.com
www.BandLetter.com
2. AN EFFECTIVE WEBSITE W. A SQUEEZE PAGE
Internet Marketer ’s Strategy : A website that captures leads by making an offer that people want - a free ebook , MP3 , a special report , a video , etc .
Wth this system , a potential fan will sign up to your mailing list because he sees value in the offer ( it is called a squeeze page because the email address is “ squeezed ” out of the fan ) .
I know what you are thinking !
It is very easy to unsubscribe once signed up and so it ’s not a ploy at all .
You are providing a quality offer and you are askig for their email address in exchange for it .
Goal :
Get as many people onto your list as possible .
Product : A website that has a backend that stores email addresses and instantly delivers visitors the requested offer ( An MP3 is what I would suggest to all musicians ) .
I suggest talking to your webs designer to implement this .
aweber and 1 Shopping Cart are two systems that can be integrated into your site to deliver these results .
www.aweber.com
www.1ShoppingCart.com
Internet Marketer ’s Strategy : A system and plan that offers multiple products potential fans in many price categories
Internet Marketers know that these are the three main ways to increase income .
1. Increase your customer ( fan ) base .
2 . Increase the average transaction amount that you get from each customer ( fan . )
3 . Increase the amount of times and frequency by which they purchase from you .
Goal : Earn more money !
The thinking here is : it takes ten times more effort to make a totally new fan than it does to keep offering fans that already love you multiple items over time .
Product :
There are plenty of mind mapping products and fancy software programs for planning out your strategy but good old pen and paper and a few brain storming sessions should get you off o the right path .
Final Goal : long - term success .
Strategy :
An overall marketing plan laid out with goals , vision , and measurable results .
Product : A line of offerings to sell to your fans : not only Cds and MP3s but also private gigs , merch and special events .
I would love to hear some of your strategies and what products and ideas are working for you .
If you are thinking like an Internet marketer I want to know about it !
Please post what you do that gets you results !
Readers of books for or against religion , not least at this time of the year , may bear it in mind .
Though exponents of dogmas and norms of every faith and denomination may be flawed , and though affirming God does n't necessarily solve the vexing question about the persistence of evil in the world , or the mysteries of life and death , no amount of scientific advances can eradicate the fundamental human awareness of a power that 's beyond us and which tradition has often identified as God .
I imagine some religious believers may arrive on this post because their Internet search was fairly close to its title .
Kind of pathetic , is n't it ?
How insecure must one be to scour the Internet searching for ways to force others to conform to one 's god belief ?
Since you are here , let 's get on with it .
Let me say at the outset that this is not a challenge , a demand for evidence , a call for miracles , or anything of the sort .
I pose no grand test for believers to meet , nor do I intend this as a trap for the dimwitted .
There is a very simple way that atheists can be persuaded to believe in god , and I will reveal it in this post .
If those who call themselves religious ever want to defeat the big bad atheism once and for all , this is how to do it .
Just realize that it will come at a bit of a price .
To persuade an atheist to believe in god , all one has to do is define " god " so broadly that it cannot possibly be doubted .
A recent opinion piece in The Toronto Star by Rabbigives us an example of how this works .
By defining god as merely something beyond us , only the solipsist can doubt god .
I told you it was simple .
But surely , the religious person will argue , a god defined this broadly is rendered meaningless .
I do not disagree .
In fact , I suggest that we 're already there .
But remember , this all - inclusive sort of " god " was the god of Einstein , Sagan , Darwin , and countless others who both religious and atheist communities claim as their own .
And just think of the appeal !
The religious could claim every prominent scientist as one of their own if they would merely expand their definition of god and jettison that little matter of the supernatural

The following is a partial list of blogs and websites running our widgets .
It ’s been a little while since I gave an update about Dana , so here it is .
There has been very little code progress in the last week .
Instead , because of the self - embedding issues I talked about last time , I have been exploring the use of a combinator calculus as an intermediate stage for typechecking .
I ’m on to something , though nothing is terribly concrete yet .
The combinator basis I ’m using is :
Sxyz = xz( yz ) Ktxy = x -- with the constraint ( y:t ) Bxyz = x ( yz ) Cxyz = xzy Itx = x -- with the constraint ( x:t )
Along with primitives for Pi , Arrow ( which is always expressible as Pi , but this keeps term size down ) , and Type .
The point of the constraints is to provide type annotations .
I added a type annotation to every combinator which “ erases ” a lambda ( rather than just pushing it downward ) during factorization , because when a lambda is erased so is its annotation , so this puts it back .
My goal is for the typechecker not to use any supply of unique names .
Checking is not totally straightforward .
Notice how terms like S have no unique most general type ; they would have to take some type arguments to do that .
So my current lead is that the type of a combinator term t is either a “ real ” type , or it ’s a function which takes a term x and returns the type of t x ( or another such function , etc. ) .
This algorithm will be partial ; i.e. there will be cases where I require an argument to have an actual type rather than a function .
This is because attempting the “ total ” algorithm is undecidable , so it ’s partial anyway .
The other thing I ’ve been thinking about is a simple , composable “ RTS language ” , which does explicit memory management in some form , in which I could implement a garbage collector , etc .
This has not been as fruitful as my combinator explorations .
I ’ve been looking at various forms of linear lambda calculus , which has been neat and enlightening — for example , there is a sense in which all computable functions are differentiable using LLC , which I might blog about soon — but unfortunately it does not look very promising as an RTS language .
Any suggestions ?
And today I started thinking about what I will need to write my higher - level languages , in particular PureHaskell ( Haskell98 sans IO and FFI ) .
It ’s pretty annoying that I ca n’t use any Haskell libraries which use tricky GHC extensions , because those kill my bootstrap ( i.e. , my PureHaskell compiler needs to be in PureHaskell ) .
There are a lot of libraries that use extensions .
For once I wish the flagship compiler were n’t so capable !
