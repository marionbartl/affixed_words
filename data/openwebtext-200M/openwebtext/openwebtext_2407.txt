XAT 3 THE HISTORY OF MONEY PART 3
WORLD WAR I ( 1914 - 1918 )
The Germans borrowed money from the German Rothschilds bank , the British from the British Rothschilds bank , and the French from the French Rothschilds .
American super banker J.P. Morgan was amongst other things also a sales agent for war materials .
Six months into the war his spending of $ 10 million a day made him the largest consumer on the planet .
The Rockefeller 's and the head of president Willson 's War Industries Board , Bernard Baruch each made some 200 million dollars while families contributed their sons to the bloody front lines , but profit was not the only motive for involvement .
Russia had spoiled the money changers plan to split America in two , and remained the last major country not to have its own central bank .
However , three years after the start of the war the entire Russian Royal Family was killed and Communism began .
You might find it strange to learn that the Russian Revolution was also fuelled with British money .
Capitalist businessmen financing Communism ?
Author Gary Allen gives his explanation :
" If one understands that socialism is not a share - the - wealth programme , but is in reality a method to consolidate and control the wealth , then the seeming paradox of super - rich men promoting socialism becomes no paradox at all .
Instead , it becomes logical , even the perfect tool of power - seeking megalomaniacs .
Communism or more accurately , socialism , is not a movement of the downtrodden masses , but of the economic elite . "
Gary Allen , Author
W.Cleon Skousen wrote in his book ' The Naked Capitalist ' .
" Power from any source tends to create an appetite for additional power ...
It was almost inevitable that the super - rich would one day aspire to control not only their own wealth , but the wealth of the whole world .
To achieve this , they were perfectly willing to feed the ambitions of the power - hungry political conspirators who were committed to the overthrow of all existing governments and the establishments of a central world - wide dictatorship . "
W.Cleon Skousen
Extreme revolutionary groups were controlled by being financed when they complied and cut off , with money sometimes being given to their opposition , when they did n't .
If you find this hard to believe , listen to what the so called dictator of the new Soviet Union had to say .
" The state does not function as we desired .
The car does not obey .
A man is at the wheel and seems to lead it , but the car does not drive in the desired direction .
It moves as another force wishes . "
Vladimir Lenin 1
Rep. Louis T. McFadden , chairman of the House Banking and Currency Committee throughout the 1920 - 30s explained it this way .
" The course of Russian history has , indeed , been greatly affected by the operations of international bankers ...
The Soviet Government has been given United States Treasury funds by the Federal Reserve Board ... acting through the Chase Bank . ...
England has drawn money from us through the Federal Reserve Banks and has re-lent it at high rates of interest to the Soviet Government ...
The Dnieperstory Dam was built with funds unlawfully taken from the United States Treasury by the corrupt and dishonest Federal Reserve Board and the Federal Reserve Banks . "
Rep. Louis T.McFadden ( D - PA ) 2
Even when Communism collapsed in the Soviet Union , Boris Yeltsin revealed that most of the foreign aid was ending up , we quote .
" straight back into the coffers of western banks in debt service . "

WORLD DOMINATION
With Russia down the money changers now had control of every major national economy .
Like a steam roller moving and a wolf gathering its pack , there was only one thing left to do and that was to go global .
The first attempt was the proposal at the Paris Peace Conference after WWI to set up the League of Nations .
Old habits die hard , and even what they called ' the war to end all wars ' was not enough to convince nations to dissolve their boundaries .
The League died .
If politicians really were being controlled , you would think at least one would break ranks and cry out against it .
Many did .
One was no less than former New York City Mayor John Haylan
" These international bankers and Rockefeller - Standard Oil interests control the majority of the newspapers and magazines in this country .
They use the columns of these papers to club into submission or drive out of office public officials who refuse to do the bidding of the powerful corrupt cliques which compose the invisible government ....
The warning of Theodore Roosevelt has much timeliness today , for the real menace of our republic is this invisible government which like a giant octopus sprawls its slimy length over City , State , and nation ...
It seizes in its long and powerful tentacles our executive officers , our legislative bodies , our schools , our courts , our newspapers , and every agency created for the public protection ...
To depart from mere generalisations , let me say that at the head of this octopus are the Rockefeller - Standard Oil interest and a small group of powerful banking houses generally referred to as the international bankers .
The little coterie of powerful international bankers virtually run the United States government for their own selfish purposes .
They practically control both parties , write political platforms , make catspaws of party leaders , use the leading men of private organisations , and resort to every device to place in nomination for high public office only such candidates as will be amenable to the dictates of corrupt big business ...
These international bankers and Rockefeller - Standard Oil interests control the majority of newspapers and magazines in this country . "
John Hylan , Mayor of New York 1927 , 1
These warnings fell on deaf ears , drowned out by the music and excitement of the roaring 20's .
People do n't tend to complain much in times of prosperity , so the money changers used this boom time they had created to defuse any complaints about their growing control .
1. ( Former New York City Mayor John Haylan speaking in Chicago and quoted in the March 27 , 1927 , New York Times )
DEPRESSION IN 1929
Stack in front of you the biographies of all the Wall Street giants , J.P. Morgan , Joe F. Kennedy , J.D Rockefeller , Bernard Baruch , and you 'll find they all marvel at how they got out of the stock market and put their assets in gold just before the crash .
Non mention a secret directive , since revealed , sent by the father of the Federal Reserve , Paul Warburg , warning of the coming collapse and depression .
With control of the press and the education system , few Americans are aware that the Fed caused the depression .
It is however a well known fact among leading top economists .
" The Federal Reserve definitely caused the Great depression by contracting the amount of currency in circulation by one - third from 1929 to 1933 . "
Milton Friedman , Nobel Prize winning economist
" It was not accidental .
It was a carefully contrived occurrence ...
The international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all . "
Rep. Louis T.McFadden ( D - PA )
" I think it can hardly be disputed that the statesmen and financiers of Europe are ready to take almost any means to re-acquire rapidly the gold stock which Europe lost to America as the result of World War I . "
Rep. Louis T.McFadden ( D - PA )
40 billion dollars somehow vanished in the crash .
It did n't really vanish , it simply shifted into the hands of the money changers .
This is how Joe Kennedy went from having 4 million dollars in 1929 to having over 100 million in 1935 .
During this time the Fed caused a 33 % reduction of the money supply , causing deeper depression .
HOW THE FED CREATES MONEY
We 've been talking about how the privately owned Federal Reserve can produce money from thin air .
Here 's how it 's done .
1 . The purchase of bonds is approved by the Federal Open Market Committee .
2 . The Fed buys the bonds which it pays for with electronic credits made to the sellers bank .
These credits are based on nothing .
3 . The receiving banks then use these credits as reserves from which they can loan out ten times the amount .
To reduce the amount of money in the economy they simply reverse the process .
The Fed sells bonds to the public and money is drawn from the purchasers bank to pay for them .
Each million withdrawn lowers the banks ability to loan by 10 million .
The Federal bank in this way has overall control of the US money supply , as each country 's central bank does in the same way .
The bankers , through the magic of fractional reserve banking have been delegated the right to create 90 % of the money supply .
This control makes a mockery of any elected government .
It places so called leaders behind a toy steering wheel , like the plastic ones , set up to amuse small children .
Or as Rep. Charles Lindbergh father of famous aviator Lucky Lindy puts it when commenting on the Federal Reserve Act :
" This act establishes the most gigantic trust on earth .
When the President signs this bill , the invisible government by the Monetary Power will be legalised .
The people may not know it immediately , but the day of reckoning is only a few years removed ...
The worst legislative crime of the ages is perpetrated by this banking bill . "
Rep. Charles Lindbergh ( R - MN )
Or as Woodrow Wilson put it :
" We have come to be one of the worst ruled , one of the most completely controlled governments in the civilised world - no longer a government of free opinion , no longer a government by ... a vote of the majority , but a government by the opinion and duress of a small group of dominant men .
Some of the biggest men in the United States , in the field of commerce and manufacture , are afraid of something .
They know that there is a power somewhere so organised , so subtle , so watchful , so interlocked , so complete , so pervasive , that they had better not speak above their breath when they speak in condemnation of it . "
Woodrow Wilson
In order to clearly establish that this is not a conspiracy theory , but is actually how things are controlled , we further quote Charles Lindbergh .
From the house of representatives , Lindbergh was well placed to see exactly what was happening back then and continues to happen today .
" To cause high prices all the federal reserve board will do will be to lower the re-discount rate ... , producing an expansion of credit and a rising stock market ; then when ... business men are adjusted to these conditions , it can check ... prosperity in mid-career by arbitrarily raising the rate of interest .
It can cause the pendulum of a rising and falling market to swing gently back and forth by slight changes in the discount rate , or cause violent fluctuations by greater rate variation , and in either case it will possess inside information as to financial conditions and advance knowledge of the coming change , either up or down .
This is the strangest , most dangerous advantage ever placed in the hands of a special privilege class by any Government that ever existed .
The system is private , conducted for the sole purpose of obtaining the greatest possible profits from the use of other people 's money .
They know in advance when to create panics to their advantage .
They also know when to stop panic .
Inflation and deflation work equally well for them when they control finance ... "
Rep. Charles Lindbergh ( R - MN )
ADOLF'S BANKERS
Most all will be aware of Hitler 's rise to power .
What they probably do n't know is that he was almost completely financed by money drawn from the privately owned American Federal Reserve .
" After WWI , Germany fell into the hands of the international bankers .
Those bankers bought her and they now own her , lock , stock , and barrel .
They have purchased her industries , they have mortgages on her soil , they control her production , they control all her public utilities .
The international German bankers have subsidised the present Government of Germany and they have also supplied every dollar of the money Adolph Hitler has used in his lavish campaign to build up threat to the government of Bruening .
When Bruening fails to obey the orders of the German International Bankers , Hitler is brought forth to scare the Germans into submission ...
Through the Federal Reserve Board over $ 30 billion of American money has been pumped into Germany .
You have all heard of the spending that has taken place in Germany ...
Modernistic dwellings , her great planetariums , her gymnasiums , her swimming pools , her fine public highways , her perfect factories .
All this was done on our money .
All this was given to Germany through the Federal Reserve Board .
The Federal Reserve Board has pumped so many billions of dollars into Germany that they dare not name the total . "
Congressman Louis T.McFadden ( D - PA ) who served twelve years as Chairman of the Committee on Banking and Currency .
FORT KNOX
In 1933 new President Franklin D. Roosevelt signed a bill forcing all the American people , to hand over all their gold at base rate .
With the exception of rare coins .
He disowned himself from the bill claiming to not have read it and his secretary of the treasury claimed this was " what the experts wanted " .
Bought at bargain basement price with money produced from nothing by the Federal Reserve , the gold was melted down and stacked in the newly built bullion depository called Fort Knox .
Once collected in 1935 the price of gold was raised from $ 20.66 up to $ 35 per ounce , but only non American gold qualified to be sold .
This meant those who had avoided the crash by investing in gold they had shipped to London could now nearly double their money while the rest of America starved .
But that 's not all folks .
By the end of WWII Fort Knox did hold 70 % of the world 's gold , but over the years it was sold off to the European money changers while a public audit of Fort Knox reserves was repeatedly denied .
Rumours spread about missing gold .
" Allegations of missing gold from our Fort Knox vaults are being widely discussed in European circles .
But what is puzzling is that the Administration is not hastening to demonstrate conclusively that there is no cause for concern over our gold treasure - if indeed it is in a position to do so . "
Edith Roosevelt
Finally in 1981 President Ronald Reagan was convinced to have a look into Fort Knox with a view to re-introducing the Gold Standard .
He appointed a group called The Gold Commission .
They found that the US Treasury owned no gold at all .
All the Fort Knox gold remaining is now being held as collateral by the Federal Reserve against the national debt .
Using credits made from nothing .
The Fed had robbed the largest treasure of gold on earth .
WORLD WAR II ( 1939 - 1945 )
World War II saw the US debt increased by 598 % , while Japan 's debt went up by 1,348 % , with France up by 583 % and Canada up by 417 % .
When you hear this , what is your first impression ?
Do you automatically think this is bad or this is good ?
Most of us feel a well programmed sense of desperation when we hear figures like this , but remember , to the money changers , this is music to their ears .
With the hot war over , the cold war began , the arms race causing more and more borrowing .
Now the money changers could really concentrate on global domination .
Step one , the European Monetary Union and NAFTA .
Step two , centralise the global economy via the World Bank , the IMF and GATT ( now the WTO ) .
THE WORLD CENTRAL BANK ( 1948 - Present )
In Washington , the headquarters of both the World Bank and the IMF ( International Monetary Fund ) face each other on the same street .
What are these organisations , and who controls them ?
To find out we need to look back to just after WWI .
At this point the money changers were attempting to consolidate the central banks under the guise of peacemaking .
To stop future wars they put forward the formation of a world central bank named the Bank of International Settlements , a world court called the World Court in the Hague , and a world executive for legislation called the League of Nations .
In his 1966 book entitled Tragedy and Hope , president Clinton 's mentor Carroll Quigley writes about this .
" The powers of financial capitalism had [ a ] far - reaching [ plan ] , nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole .
This system was to be controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert , by secret agreements arrived at in frequent meetings and conferences .
The apex of the system was to be the Bank for International Settlements in Basel , Switzerland , a private bank owned and controlled by the world 's central banks which were themselves private corporations .
Each central bank ...
Sought to dominate its government by its ability to control treasury loans , to manipulate foreign exchanges , to influence the level of economic activity in the country , and to influence cooperative politicians by subsequent economic rewards in the business world . "
Carroll Quigley , Professor , Georgetown University
They got 2 out of 3 .
The league of nations failed largely owing to the suspicions of the people and while opposition concentrated on this , the other two proposals snuck their way through .
It would take another war to wear the public resistance down .
Wall street invested heavily to rebuild Germany , as the Chase bank had propped up the Russian revolution .
Now the Chase merged with the Warburg 's Manhattan Bank to form the Chase Manhattan which would later merge with the Chemical Bank to become the largest bank on Wall Street .
In 1944 the US approved its full participation in the IMF and the World Bank .
By 1945 the second League of Nations was approved under the new name ' The United Nations ' .
The war had dissolved all opposition .
The methods used in the National Banking Act of 1864 and the Federal Reserve Act of 1913 were now simply used on a Global scale .
The Federal Reserve Act allowing the creation of Federal Reserve notes is mirrored by the IMF 's authority to produce money called Special Drawing Rights ( SDR's ) .
It is estimated the IMF has produced $ 30 billion dollars worth of SDR 's so far .
In the United States SDR's are already accepted as legal money , and all other member nations are being pressured to follow suit .
With SDR 's being partially backed by gold , a world gold standard is sneaking its way in through the back door , which comes with no objection from the money changers who now hold two - thirds of the worlds gold and can use this to structure the worlds economy to their further advantage .
We have gone from the goldsmith 's fraud being reproduced on a national scale through the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve , to a Global level with the IMF and the World Bank .
Unless we together stop giving these exchange units their power by our collective faith in them , the future will probably see the Intergalactic Bank and the Federation of Planets Reserve set up in much the same way .
This radical transfer of power has taken place with absolutely no mandate from the people .
Nations borrow Special Drawing Right from the International Monetary Fund in order to pay interest on their mounting debts .
With these SDR 's produced at no cost , the IMF charges more interest .
This contrary to bold claims does not alleviate poverty or further any development .
It just creates a steady flow of wealth from borrowing nations to the money changers who now control the IMF and the World Bank .
The permanent debt of Third World Countries is constantly being increased to provide temporary relief from the poverty being caused by previous borrowing .
These repayments already exceed the amount of new loans .
By 1992 Africa 's debt had reached $ 290 billion dollars , which is two and a half times greater than it was in 1980 .
A noble attempt to repay it has caused increased infant mortality and unemployment , plus deteriorating schools , and general health and welfare problems .
As world resources continue to be sucked into this insatiable black hole of greed , if allowed to continue the entire world will face a simular fate .
As one prominent Brazilian politician , Luis Ignacio Silva , ðput it .
" Without being radical or overly bold , I will tell you that the Third World War has already started - a silent war , not for that reason any the less sinister .
This war is tearing down Brazil , Latin America and practically all the Third World .
Instead of soldiers dying there are children , instead of millions of wounded there are millions of unemployed ; instead of destruction of bridges there is the tearing down of factories , schools , hospitals , and entire economies . . .
It is a war by the United States against the Latin American continent and the Third World .
It is a war over the foreign debt , one which has as its main weapon interest , a weapon more deadly than the atom bomb , more shattering than a laser beam . . "
1
If a group or organisation had used its hard earned money to help these developing nations , then we might sympathise that there should be a real effort to repay these loans .
But the money used was created from fractional reserve banking .
The money loaned to the Third World came from the 90 % the banks allow themselves to loan on the 10 % they actually held .
It did n't exist , it was created from nothing , and now people are suffering and dying in an effort to pay it back .
This has gone beyond clever financing , it 's whole sale murder and it's time we stopped it .
We can !

100,000 Polish workers say goodbye to Britain as jobs become harder to find
Around 100,000
Polish workers have quit Britain over the past year , ministers said yesterday .
The retreat has come as jobs become harder to find and the pound has weakened against European currencies .
Officials now believe that as many as half of those who flooded in from Eastern Europe after the EU relaxed its rules in 2004 may now have gone home .
That would mean as many as 350,000 have returned over the past two years .
Any exodus has yet to show up in surveys published by the Government 's Office for National Statistics , which has been stepping up efforts to record accurate levels of immigration .
ONS estimates have continued to show the population is increasing because of immigration .
Polish people who came to the United Kingdom to find work are returning .
However there have been signs , particularly in the construction industry , that fewer Eastern European workers are available , leading to concerns about labour shortages .
Border and immigration minister Phil Woolas said : ' It would appear an estimated 100,000 Polish workers left over the past year .
' Businesses need skilled workers from countries like Poland to help them grow .
' But we need to balance the needs of the economy with managing population growth . '
A spokesman for the UK Border Agency said : ' Our figures show that fewer Eastern Europeans are coming here and research suggests that half of those that came to the UK to work have now gone home .
' On top of this our new points system means only those with the skills we need will be able to work or study here and no more .
' This strict new system , plus our plans for newcomers to earn citizenship , will reduce overall numbers of economic migrants coming to Britain , and the numbers that stay . '
Among indicators available to ministers is the Worker Registration Scheme , set up in 2004 when Poland and seven other Eastern European countries joined the EU .
The scheme was intended to check the number of incoming workers and limit their rights to state benefits .
Last year 150,245 Poles applied to join the register .
But this year numbers are likely to be below 100,000 .
The scheme does not count all Eastern European migrants because it does not include self - employed workers , while many are thought to have avoided it entirely .
According to a study by the ONS , the number of Eastern Europeans with jobs has gone up by 381,000 since 2001 and the number of other foreigners in employment rose by 480,000 .
In all around 700,000 Eastern European migrants are thought to have come to Britain .
The Conservatives claim the fall shows that immigration levels can be reduced .
Shadow Home Secretary Dominic Grieve said : ' We are glad the Government is coming round to our way of thinking .
' This is yet more evidence that immigration can be controlled and the Government should answer our calls to have an annual limit on non-EU immigration . '
THE MEASURE OF MENDACITY ….
At one point in last night ’s debate , towards the end , Sarah Palin insisted that Joe Biden “ supported John McCain ’s military strategies pretty adamantly until this race and you had opposed very adamantly Barack Obama ’s military strategy . ”
This , of course , is ridiculous , and Josh Marshall labeled it “ her biggest whopper . ”
To be sure , it ’s right up there on the list , but was it her biggest whopper ?
That ’s hard to say ; there are so many to choose from .
It ’s frustrating , in a way , to take in the post - debate analysis and consider what the pundits generally find important .
The fact that the vast majority of Sarah Palin ’s claims were demonstrably false seems like an inconvenient tangent .
We ’ve come to expect a breathtaking degree of dishonesty from Palin over the last five weeks — anyone who repeats , dozens of times , that she opposed the Bridge to Nowhere after she publicly supported it has already forfeited quite a bit of credibility — but looking over my notes from last night , I came up with this list of my favorite Palin lies .
* Obama voted against troop funding ?
That ’s wildly misleading .
* Obama voted to raise taxes 94 times ?
That ’s absurd .
* Obama wants “ the feds ” to “ take over ” Americans ’ “ mandated ” healthcare ?
That ’s not even close to reality .
* Obama voted to raise taxes on families making only $ 42,000 a year ?
A transparent lie .
* Palin boasted that she was among the Alaskan policymakers who “ called for divestment ” from state money invested in Sudan .
Actually , her administration opposed divestment , at least at first , saying the Alaska Permanent Fund should n’t take social or political agendas into consideration .
Now , it ’s hard to say with certainty whether Palin was lying or was just hopelessly wrong .
It boils down to whether the viewer believes she knows what she ’s talking about while making these claims .
But picking her biggest whopper ?
That ’s a tough one .
Army shreds documents on friendly fire deaths John Byrne
Published : Thursday November 20 , 2008

In late 2006 , two American soldiers from Fort Carson died in Iraq .
The army said the privates were killed by enemy action .
But in October of this year , Salon revealed that the two men had in fact been killed by friendly tank fire .
Now , Salon has found that the documents related to the men's deaths were shredded just hours after the story was published .
" Three soldiers at Fort Carson , Colo . -- including two who were present in Ramadi during the friendly fire incident , one of them just feet from where Nelson and Suarez died -- were ordered to shred two boxes full of documents about [ Albert ] Nelson and [ Roger ] Suarez , " reporter Mark Benjamin writes .
" One of the soldiers preserved some of the documents as proof that the shredding occurred and provided them to Salon .
All three soldiers , with the assistance of a U.S. senator 's office , have since been relocated for their safety . "
The night the Salon story ran , Oct. 14 , 2008 , a staff sergeant told three soldiers to shred two boxes of documents relating to the privates ' deaths .
" Staff Sgt. Swinton was in charge that night , " Benjamin adds .
" He told Kremling , Mitchum and a third soldier who had reported for duty that the evening 's labor would include the inglorious task of cleaning out a closet .
The first priority , Swinton said , was to shred the thousands of pages of documents in two large copy - paper - size boxes .
It would be tedious work , but Swinton was adamant .
' He says , ' I need that paper shredded .
That has to be done tonight , '' remembered Kremling , who volunteered to get started on the job . "
Privates Nelson and Suarez appear to have been killed by an American tank shell -- not in fact by enemy action as the military claimed .
" Based on the testimony of eyewitnesses , and on video and audio recorded by a helmet - mounted camera that captured much of the action that day , my report stated that Nelson and Suarez seemed to have been killed by an American tank shell , " Benjamin said .
" The shell apparently struck their position on the roof of a two - story ferro - concrete building in Ramadi , Anbar province , Iraq , killing Suarez instantly , mortally wounding Nelson , and injuring several other soldiers .
I included both an edited and a full - length version of the video in the article .
The video shows soldiers just after the blast claiming to have watched the tank fire on them .
Then a sergeant attempts to report over a radio that a U.S. tank killed his men .
He seems to be promptly overruled by a superior officer who is not at the scene .
An official Army investigation then found that the simultaneous impact of two enemy mortars killed the men . "
The helmet cam video capturing the scene appears below .
It contains coarse language and graphic violence .

( CNN ) --
Was it a theft ?
A prank ?
A roundabout effort to bring some holiday cheer to the police ?
Authorities in Harwich , Massachusetts , are probing the mysterious appearance of a piano , in good working condition , in the middle of the woods .
Officer Derek Dutra of the Harwich Police Department examines the mystery piano in the Massachusetts woods .
Discovered by a woman who was walking a trail , the Baldwin Acrosonic piano , model number 987 , is intact -- and , apparently , in tune .
Sgt. Adam Hutton of the Harwich Police Department said information has been broadcast to all the other police departments in the Cape Cod area in hopes of drumming up a clue , however minor it may be .
But so far , the investigation is flat .
Also of note :
Near the mystery piano -- serial number 733746 -- was a bench , positioned as though someone was about to play .
The piano was at the end of a dirt road , near a walking path to a footbridge in the middle of conservation land near the Cape .
It took a handful of police to move the piano into a vehicle to transport it to storage , so it would appear that putting it into the woods took more than one person .
Do n't Miss WCVB : No claim on found piano
Asked whether Harwich police will be holding a holiday party in the storage bay -- tickling the ivories , pouring eggnog -- while they await word of the piano 's origin and fate , Hutton laughed .
No such plans .
Harwich police have had some fun , though .
Among the photos they sent to the news media is one of Officer Derek Dutra examining the piano in the woods .
The police entitled the photo " Liberace . "
CNN 's Justin Lear contributed to this report .

A senior policeman believed to be from the unit responsible for developing drug and alcohol policies was caught drink - driving on Melbourne Cup Day .
The Age believes a senior sergeant from the Drug and Alcohol Strategy Unit was found to have a blood alcohol of .079 when he was tested on Elliott Avenue in Parkville , .029 over the legal limit .
The penalty for such an offence is $ 330 and a six - month driving ban .
" A Victoria Police senior sergeant who works in the VPC ( Victoria Police Centre ) was caught for driving while exceeding the prescribed blood alcohol concentration ( BAC ) limit , " a police spokesman said yesterday .
" A penalty notice was issued and he 'will face internal disciplinary action as per usual procedure .
The incident occurred on Elliott Avenue in Parkville on Melbourne Cup Day . "
The role of the Drug and Alcohol Strategy Unit is to co-ordinate the development and implementation of drug and alcohol policies , strategies and initiatives within Victoria Police .
( CNN ) -- Pakistani authorities have charged an American being held in Pakistan 's tribal region with illegal entry and illegal possession of a weapon , the State Department said Friday .
Juddi Kenan Mohamed was arrested Monday at a checkpoint in the northern district of Mohmand near Peshawar as he was trying to enter the area , said Husain Haqqani , Pakistan 's ambassador to the United States .
Mohamed was carrying a U.S. passport and said he was traveling to see a friend in the tribal area near the Afghanistan border , Haqqani said .
However , he was detained because all foreigners are required to have a permit to enter such areas .
There is no evidence Mohamed poses a security risk , Haqqani said .
Gordon Duguid , a State Department spokesman , said the U.S. consul general visited Mohamed in Islamabad on Tuesday and is seeking another visit .
The United States is providing " all possible assistance " to Mohamed , including helping him find a lawyer , Duguid said .

Citing privacy laws , Duguid could not explain why Mohamed was detained in Pakistan 's tribal region , which is largely controlled by Taliban and al Qaeda militants .
Haqqani said Mohamed is believed to hold dual citizenship in America and Pakistan , and also has a Pashtun name .
He said Mohamed 's mother has described the situation as a misunderstanding , and Pakistani security services are investigating .
Pakistan 's military is waging a bloody battle against Taliban and al Qaeda militants inside the lawless region along the border with Afghanistan .
U.S. forces based in Afghanistan have also targeted militants in Pakistan 's tribal region .
Last month , the U.S. military sent ground forces into South Waziristan -- also a tribal area -- without Islamabad 's permission , prompting an angry response from Islamabad over reported civilian casualties .
And media reports have said that several months ago , President Bush authorized U.S. special forces to carry out ground assaults inside Pakistan without seeking Islamabad 's permission .

NEW YORK( CNNMoney.com ) --
Seeking shelter amid a global credit crunch and consumer spending slowdown , American Express announced Monday it is becoming a bank .
The Federal Reserve , using emergency power to act swiftly , granted approval for AmEx and American Express Travel Related Services to become bank holding companies .
The move will give AmEx the ability to grow its deposits - a more stable form of funding - and provide it greater access to Fed funding and government rescue programs .
" Given the continued volatility in the financial markets , we want to be best positioned to take advantage of the various programs the federal government has introduced or may introduce to support U.S. financial institutions , " said Chief Executive Kenneth Chenault in a statement .
The company currently operates a small bank , American Express Centurion Bank , as well as a savings and loan , American Express Bank , which together have just over $ 50 billion in assets and $ 14.4 billion in deposits .
They offer mainly credit cards , loans and certificates of deposit , the company said .
" We will continue to build a larger deposit base to broaden our funding sources , " said Chenault .
" With Federal Reserve oversight we should gain greater access to the capital on offer under the current and any future government - sponsored programs . "
On Oct. 3 , the bank subsidiaries were given access to the Fed funding window , giving the company an alternate financing source , according to federal filings .
AmEx also said late last month it would issue short - term debt through the Fed 's Commercial Paper Funding Facility , which provides company with financing for its day - to - day operations .
It did not say whether it would seek access to capital injections from the federal government under the $ 700 billion financial institution rescue plan .
The shift will also subject it to increased regulation by the Fed .
As an independent specialty finance company , AmEx relied greatly on bundling its credit card loans into securities and selling them to investors .
But this securitization market has dried up in the wake of the mortgage meltdown .
Since it does n't have bank deposits as a cushion , AmEx is too vulnerable to funding disruptions , said Howard Shapiro , analyst at Fox - Pitt Cochran Caronia .
" It 's all because of funding concerns , " he said .
" It 's become prohibitively expensive to securitize .
This is a way of accessing cheaper forms of liquidity . "
Laying off 7,000 employees
The surprise announcement comes less than two weeks after the credit card issuer announced it was laying off 7,000 people after reporting a 24 % drop in quarterly profits .
AmEx also said it would cut overhead expenses , including spending on business consultants , travel and entertainment , as well as scale back spending on business development and streamline costs associated with some rewards programs .
Rating agencies and analysts voiced concerns about the company 's ability to withstand a prolonged , deep recession .
Moody 's downgraded the company last month on concerns that AmEx may not be able to weather this potentially severe consumer - led economic downturn as well as previous recessions .
Though it beat expectations for the quarter , executives said last month they anticipate the global economy to continue weakening well into 2009 .
AmEx also attempted to address shareholders ' liquidity concerns , stressing it could fund its business for at least a year and that it has access to various programs set up by the federal government to support businesses during these difficult times .
The Fed noted in its release that AmEx and its banks are well capitalized .
The shift , however , indicates deep problems at the company , said Red Gillen , senior analyst at Celent .
" They are clearly in trouble , " he said .
" I do n't know if we knew how bad things actually were even two weeks ago . "
AmEx ( AXP , Fortune 500 ) stock fell $ 1.45 to $ 22.52 in mid-day trading Tuesday , down from its previous close of $ 23.98 .
AmEx is the third financial company to convert to a bank holding company since the global credit crunch heightened in mid-September .
Goldman Sachs and Morgan Stanley , Wall Street 's last two remaining stand - alone investment banks , converted to bank holding companies a week after Lehman Brothers filed for bankruptcy .

Mrs Palin took part in a debate with Mr Halcro ( left ) in Alaska in 2006
Ask nearly anyone in Alaska , and they will tell you that Governor Sarah Palin is a great debater .
If anyone knows the challenge that lies ahead for Senator Joe Biden , it is Andrew Halcro , 44 , who took part in a handful of debates with Mrs Palin during the 2006 race to be Alaska 's governor .
" The one thing I found during the [ 2006 ] debates was no matter how knowledgeable her opponents were on the issues , it did n't matter , " Mr Halcro told BBC News .
" She has an amazing ability to turn a 45 - second answer into a folksy story ... she 's never been forced to know the issues . "
Mr Halcro said Mrs Palin 's biggest strength was her ability to " fill the room with her presence " .
Having studied at Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government and Harvard Business School , in addition to being an Alaskan and a lawmaker , Mr Halcro came to the debates armed with a wealth of knowledge and statistics .
Beyond statistics Mrs Palin even said Mr Halcro would make " the awesomest statistician " , when asked during a debate to which position she would appoint Mr Halcro if elected governor .
Governor Sarah Palin has performed well in previous debates Still , statistics were not enough to put even the smallest dent in Mrs Palin 's rising popularity .
" There were many times the third candidate and I would walk off stage and shake our heads , " Mr Halcro said .
" It was n't policy , it was populism . "
Whatever it was , Mrs Palin beat her opponents , garnering 48 % of the vote , while Democratic candidate Tony Knowles received 40 % and independent Halcro received 9 % .
" I do n't think anyone could have beat her , " Mr Halcro said .
" It was n't about how much she knew about the issues .
People did n't care about her experience , they just thought , ' This is the drink of water we need ' . "
Mr Halcro , and many others from Mrs Palin 's home state , will be watching to see whether she appears on stage this Thursday to similarly capture the hearts and votes of the rest of Americans in the " Lower 48 " states .
I think she has more to lose now .
Her ratio of importance to the Republican ticket was greater than Biden's to the Democratic ticket .
She carries more weight , so there 's the possibility for an equally large downside
Richard Parker Lecturer in Public Policy , Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government
But Richard Parker , a lecturer in public policy at Harvard 's Kennedy School of Government , said it might be tricky to transfer her immense success in Alaska on to the national stage .
" I think she plays to great advantage the small town hockey mom persona , " Mr Parker said .
" For Alaska that 's terrific .
But for states like Ohio and Pennsylvania , who are dealing with panic about the economy , who knows ? "
Balancing act Mr Parker said that at the height of Mrs Palin 's popularity honeymoon a couple of weeks ago , it had been Mr Biden who had most needed to put on a strong performance .
But with the downturn of the economy , the public 's dubious reaction to Mrs Palin 's recent interviews , and some conservative columnists calling on her to withdraw from the ticket due to her inexperience , Mr Parker said more focus will be on Mrs Palin .
" I think she has more to lose now , " Mr Parker said .
" Her ratio of importance to the Republican ticket was greater than Biden 's to the Democratic ticket .
She carries more weight , so there 's the possibility for an equally large downside . "
Nearly 55 million viewers tuned into the first presidential debate last Friday , and with unusually intense focus on the vice - presidential candidates in this election , Mr Biden and Mrs Palin can expect to have a lot of eyes watching them .
Senator Joe Biden , an experienced debater , says he will focus on policy Mr Halcro , a Republican still unsure who to vote for in November , said the key for Mr Biden was to focus on the policy issues and let the moderator ensure Mrs Palin answered the questions .
" He should n't be afraid to point out contradictions in a respectful manner , " Mr Halcro said .
" He needs to be congenial and not appear patronising or bully - like . "
Avoiding disaster Barack Obama 's chief strategist David Axelrod has praised Mrs Palin 's debating skills , recognising it would be a challenging debate .
" I would imagine that Biden and his counsellors are going to keep it as low key as possible and hope the questions she 's asked will do her more damage , " Mr Parker said .
" The last thing he can afford is a disaster . "
Mrs Palin , on the other hand , has the challenge of maintaining her impressive debating record and proving to the rest of the world that her readiness to lead is not in doubt .
" Ten days ago , if you asked how important the vice - presidential debate would be , I would say intensely important because of Palin 's attractiveness across party lines , " Mr Parker said .
" But now with what is going on on Wall Street , I do n't think that her inexperience is going to play well . "
The BBC will be streaming the Biden - Palin debate live on its website from 0100 GMT on 3 October , with live running commentary and further analysis from our correspondents in St Louis and Washington .

What are these ?
Add Bexar County to the growing list of Texas counties where voters say they are having trouble with touch - screen machines flipping their votes .
A computer security expert who works for the federal government said that his ES&S iVotronic paperless touch - screen machine in San Antonio flipped his vote from Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama to Republican presidential candidate John McCain and then from McCain to Libertarian presidential candidate Bob Barr .
Unlike voters in seven other Texas counties who were trying to cast a straight - party Democratic ballot when the flipping occurred , the Bexar County voter was not voting a straight - party ticket .
In this manner , his experience more closely matches voters in several West Virginia counties last week and a Tennesee County who also were not voting straight - party tickets when their ES&S machine flipped their vote from one presidential candidate to another .
The voter , who asked to remain anonymous because of his government job , is an unimpeachable source , making his claim all the more credible .
[ Note : For readers who took issue with my use of the word " unimpeachable " here , I 've addressed this in the comments posted below this post . ]
He described what occurred :
I voted today ( I 'll be out of town on TDY Tuesday ) .
We had touch screen machines .
I pressed the box next to Obama / Biden and McCain / Palin registered on the screen .
I figured I must have somehow missed the sensitive region and tried it again .
Same result .
So I tried voting for Barr .
Same thing .
I voted for McCain and Barr came up .
The third time I voted for Obama , it finally took .
I did n't have this problem with any of the other 11 screens of candidates / proposals ( although several of them were uncontested races ) .
I told the old guy acting as " hall monitor " and he just shrugged .
I have no reason to suspect there 's any deliberate rigging going on here , but I can't help wondering how many other people had this problem and did n't notice they 'd voted for someone other than the candidate of their intention .
Elsewhere , a machine in Adams County , Colorado , was taken out of commission after a voter complained that it flipped her vote from state Senate Democratic candidate Mary Hodge to Hodge 's Republican opponent .
The unidentified woman tried to vote for Hodge three times , then called an election judge over when it would n't work .
The judge tried the machine and it would n't work for him either , so the machine has been taken out of service , sealed up and stored in a bag .
Adams County uses touch - screen machines with a voter - verified paper trail that are made by Premier Election Solutions ( formerly Diebold ) .

In the last election , the Paul Martin liberals used the tried and true " hidden agenda " attack on the Stephen Harper Conservatives and were gobsmacked to find the smear did n't stick .
How could it ?
Announcements , Events & more from Tyee and select partners John Horton ’s Paintings Preserve History .
His Seamanship Saves Lives
Meet the fascinating Order of BC winner who also happens to be a Tyee supporter .
Harper had been in the public eye too long .
After years in Parliament , how hidden could anyone 's agenda be ?
If Harper really had kept an agenda under wraps all those years , he probably would have forgotten it .
Most of us can't even remember where we keep our car keys if we do n't drive every day .
The media tarred Martin for running on yesterday 's game plan , just as sports columnists blamed Leafs coach Pat Quinn for failing to adjust to the New NHL .
But that hindsight insight has n't stopped our favourite pundits from recycling slightly used storylines from the last two elections this time around .
So it is that the newspapers ' collected wisdom once again is that winning polls are Harper 's enemy , and that Harper himself will do all he can to downplay the Conservatives chances of forming a majority .
Which is strange , because if we look at another favourite media narrative , we might understand why this first one no longer holds true .
Minority mayhem ?
Pundits have long parroted the idea that Harper plays politics as a chess match , several moves ahead , yet they seem almost impotent in applying that wisdom to actual events .
In fact , while the opposition parties and media seem anxious to replay history , Harper has learned from it .
In the previous two elections , when polls showed Harper flirting with majority territory , his support vanished .
So , Harper understood he must make minority government itself unpalatable .
While the Harper communications cabal has shown itself tone - deaf in many instances , they have demonstrated one impressive ability : the understanding of how much the Canadian voters will retain from non-election political news .
They have taken advantage of this by stonewalling accusations from the in - and - out affair , Cadman , Julie Couillard , and other instances , knowing headlines will read : " Opposition attacks , Government denies . "
And they know that , without bending or admitting anything , that is all that Canadians will remember .
The example that is relevant here is the Harper efforts to turn minority Parliament into the dysfunctional House of Ill Repute .
With much of Harper 's famous priorities carried through Parliament early in their tenure , Canadians could easily have been convinced that minority parliaments can work .
We have the history to back that up , with much of the beloved Pearson 's headline accomplishments coming from a minority government : universal health care , the maple leaf flag , and the Canada Pension Plan .
Taking Parliament apart
Harper was getting things done in his minority , and , many Canadians thought , was forced to hold his party 's more radical influences in check .
Many Canadians liked the idea of forced restraint .
Minority government , Canadians might believe , was safe and efficient .
And so , Harper went about changing those psychological associations .
After covering the more straightforward side of his legislative slate , Harper went to the task of taking Parliament apart .
The Liberals were happy to play into his hands , and with the two sides equally up for the task , Parliament descended into the chaos and obnoxiousness of a schoolyard .
Committees devolved into circuses -- and Harper 's central office provided the carnival program , newly written How - To guides for disrupting committees .
All sides put their worst faces forward ; venom , mud and spit flew .
But voters , the Conservatives reasoned , would blame no party more or less than any other for the mess .
What they would remember was the mess .
Cynical , but effective
That is the association most Canadians have with minority government now .
Outside Toronto , Montreal and Vancouver , Canadians are no longer scared of a Harper majority .
Many are desperate for it to rescue Parliament from its embarrassing descent into the gutter .
It 's cynical , to be sure , but if we do n't see the near 40 per cent support for the Conservatives drop any time soon , it will indicate that the prime minister has been successful in destroying the bogeyman of Conservative majority by displacing it with instinctive repulsion for minority rule .

Tyee stories :
Jon Kyl , the second - ranking Republican in the U.S. Senate , warned president - elect Barack Obama that he would filibuster U.S. Supreme Court appointments if those nominees were too liberal .
Kyl , Arizona ’s junior senator , expects Obama to appoint judges in the mold of U.S Supreme Court Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg , David Souter and Stephen Breyer .
Those justices take a liberal view on cases related to social , law and order and business issues , Kyl said .
“ He believes in justices that have empathy , ” said Kyl , speaking at a Federalist Society meeting in Phoenix .
The attorneys group promotes conservative legal principles .
Kyl said if Obama goes with empathetic judges who do not base their decisions on the rule of law and legal precedents but instead the factors in each case , he would try to block those picks via filibuster .
I 've been wondering since last Tuesday what it will feel like to be on defense for the next four years with a Democratic president and Congress and I think Senator Jon Kyl ( R - AZ ) is letting us know way before Barack Obama even assumes the office and the 111th Congress convenes .
With thanks to my friends at Crooks and Liars for the tip , I find out today that Kyl is already making noise about how , with no Supreme Court seats open and nobody on Team Obama even remotely talking about possible future nominees , he 'll fight tooth and nail to see that President Obama 's nominees are not confirmed .
Here 's an excerpt from the Phoenix Business Journal Wow .
This may be the first time a new president 's " honeymoon " period with Congress ends in the Novemberinauguration .
With the Democratic caucus sitting at 57 seats before the Senate races in Minnesota , Georgia and Alaska are even decided and with the prospect of having to oppose what might be a very popular president , Kyl 's ludicrous comments have the empty ring of the chicken saying he is going to eat the fox .
But as one who has watched the Senate for many years , I will say that President - elect Obama should know that any hand he or Senate Democrats reach across the aisle will likely be bitten or urinated upon .
In other words , we have our feet on Congressional Republicans throats .
This kind of talk from Kyl should reinforce the need to step down harder way before giving in to any foolish urge to let up .
CHICAGO -- Kerry
Wood prepared himself mentally and emotionally last season , knowing it might be his last one with the Chicago Cubs .
Turned out , it was .
Wood wanted to stay with the only team he 's ever pitched for , but the economic realities of the game and the team 's needs in other areas prevented that from happening .
After recovering from serious shoulder problems and numerous injuries that have sidetracked his career as a starter , Wood became a top closer last season .
And now as a free agent , he can hit the market and command a multiyear contract that the Cubs were not willing to offer .
" It 's bittersweet .
Obviously this is my first choice .
I wanted to stay here and the best choice for me and my family .
...
But that 's part of baseball right now , " Wood said in a conference call Friday .
Wood 's comments came one day after the Cubs traded for Marlins reliever Kevin Gregg .
General manager Jim Hendry told reporters that the fair thing was for the team to let Wood get a deal he deserved .
The GM had already told Wood face - to - face what the Cubs were planning and that getting him a multiyear deal was not one of the top priorities .
On Friday , Wood lauded Hendry for his honesty .
Chicago hopes to bring back free agent starter Ryan Dempster -- the guy Wood replaced as closer last season -- and add some left - handed offensive punch .
But Wood is one of the most popular players in team history .
He pointed out that Cubs fans watched him grow up from a " pimply - faced 17 - year - old , and when my tenure is done I 'm leaving married with two kids . "
He 's also leaving with a bag full of memories -- a 20 - strikeout game against the Astros in 1998 in his fifth major league start when he went on to become the NL Rookie of the Year ; a 2003 season when he helped the Cubs reach Game 7 of the NLCS , where he started and lost despite hitting a home run .
" I choked , " he said the night of that defeat .
Wood said this season was one of the most gratifying he 's ever experienced .
After winning the closer 's role in spring training , he saved 34 of 40 games , his fastball blazing in the mid 90 - mph range again .
He pretty much reinvented his career with the impressive return .
That career appeared to be nearly over in 2007 as he battled shoulder problems for a third straight season .
But he made a stirring comeback in August that year after the pain in his shoulder mysteriously went away and pitched well in relief .
He 's made 12 trips to the disabled list and missed the entire 1999 season after elbow ligament replacement surgery .
" I would love to change that , but can't change that , " he said .
" I could n't change it at the time .
Those things happen .
I do n't think this year would have been as rewarding as it was , if I had n't gone through those things . "
He said he 'd given a great deal of thought to what it might be like to return to Wrigley Field and play against the Cubs in a different uniform
" It will be tough sitting on the other side , " he said .
Wood signed a three - year , $ 32.5 million deal in March of 2004 and when that expired after his rash of injuries , he got one - year deals in each of the last two seasons .
He said he would have been agreeable to another one - year deal .
" Yeah .
I think that avenue was kind of approached , but again like I said , they 've got some issues they 've got to take care of , " Wood said .
" It is what it is .
It did n't work out . "
Now Wood hopes to find a new job as quickly as possible , saying he wants to go to a team with a chance to win -- preferably in the National League -- and a place with a good atmosphere for his family .
He plans to keep a home in Chicago where he and his wife are involved in charity work .
In 10 seasons over 11 years with the Cubs , Wood compiled a 77 - 61 record with a 3.65 ERA and 1,407 strikeouts in 276 games .
Wood said the incessant talk of the 100 - year anniversary of the Cubs ' last World Series winner got old , but did n't really bother him this past season .
Chicago won the NL Central for the second straight year , only to be swept out for the second straight year in the first round .
And if the Cubs do finally make a run deep into the playoffs as they were expected to this season , it will be without their familiar No. 34 .
" I 'm disappointed I wo n't be on the team that does it , " Wood said .

MSNBC host Keith Olbermann perhaps went further than ever before last night in his special comment about the 9/11 anniversary , slamming the Bush administration for their “ criminal neglect ” in allowing the attacks to occur and identifying the continued exploitation of 9/11 “ sociological pornography ” as the only reason that Bush has n’t been impeached .
Olbermann said that the anniversary of the September 11 attacks had been turned into a brand name – “ 9/11 ™ ” and that such propaganda has “ sustained a President that long ago should have been dismissed or impeached . ”
Olbermann continued , identifying 9/11 has the only thing that has kept “ ( Bush ) and his gang of financial and constitutional crooks in office , ” while they escaped blame for the “ malfeasance and criminal neglect that allowed the attacks to occur . ”
Olbermann then scorned Rudy Giuliani , keynote speaker at the Republican National Convention , for taking no counter - terror measures in - between the first and second attacks on the World Trade Center and indeed moving his counter - terror bunker , which was housed inside WTC 7 , into the World Trade Center complex .
The anchor of Countdown then returned to the disgrace of the Republicans airing graphic video of people jumping from the towers and planes slamming into the building during the second night of the convention as a “ tribute ” to 9/11 victims .
“ The television networks were told that the convention would pause early in the evening , when children could still be watching , for a 9/11 tribute and they were encouraged to broadcast that tribute .
What we got was not a tribute for the dead of 9/11 or even a tribute to the responders ….
the Republicans instead gave us sociological pornography , a virtual snuff film . ”
Noting that TV networks had agreed to stop showing the most graphic images of 9/11 years ago , Olbermann said , “ Yet the Republicans , at their convention , having virtually seized control of the cable news operations , showed the worst of it … the actual collapse of the smoking towers , a fleeting image of what might have been a victim leaping to his death from a thousand feet up , and something new …. ground level perfectly framed images of the fireball created when the second plane hit the second tower , it was terrifying , after all the object was to terrify – not to commemorate , ” said Olbermann .
The host then poured scorn on attempts to conflate 9/11 with the 1979 Iranian hostage crisis “ to stoke the flames of paranoia about another middle eastern nation . ”
Olbermann concluded by slamming John McCain for advertising the fact that he knew how to capture Bin Laden , but only offering to share his plan if he won the election .
“ By holding out on your secret plan to catch Bin Laden , by searing those images into our collective wounded American psyche at your nomination last week , terrorists are not what you John McCain fight – terrorists are what you John McCain use , ” stated Olbermann .

Pictured :
The moment a tiny mouse turned the tables on a deadly snake and turned from hunted to hunter
Whiskers twitching , the mouse stares into the jaws of death - and then pounces on them .
The little fellow had no intention of being lunch for the deadly viper whose cage he had been thrown into .
During a vicious 30 - minute struggle the mouse tore at the serpent 's head with its tiny paws and jaws , finally killing it .
Face - off :
The snake and mouse stare each other down as battle commences
Open wide :
The mouse served up as lunch makes a counter - attack on the viper , leading to a 30 - minute fight to the death
The outcome amazed firemen in Nantou , Taiwan , who had rescued the footlong snake from a local home and taken it to their fire station as a pet .
Fireman Lan Sengqiu said the snake might have used up all its venom trying to bite them when they caught it , adding : ' The mouse barely had a scratch on him . '
Vipers have a pair of long hollow fangs , that are used to inject venom from glands at the back of the jaw .
During a strike the mouth can open to nearly 180 degrees , and jaws snap shut on impact .
Death is usually caused by a collapse in blood pressure from the venom .
But snakes do have enemies .
They can fall prey to large birds , wild boars , mongooses , raccoons , foxes , coyotes , other snakes .
. . and apparently mice .
AS THE effects of the financial crisis ripple out into the wider economy , businesses are struggling .
With access to credit all but choked off and global demand falling , firms are keen for any help they can get .
America 's big companies have a friend in John McCain , who says he will cut the top federal corporate tax rate from 35 % to 25 % .
Once state and local taxes are added , the combined rate amounts to an average 40 % of profits , the second highest in rich countries .
Over the past decade , corporate - tax rates have fallen considerably , especially in the countries of the European Union .

Curiosity serves the interest of those seeking knowledge and truth .
Discovery relies on initiation .
One decision can snowball into
revelation of either devastating or miraculous proportions .
The pursuit
of knowledge and foresight takes one step and becomes addicted .
And so it was that I discovered just how misinformed our country is .
In perusing Facebook
groups that my friends had recently joined , a distinct pattern
developed : Barack must be our president to avoid more Bush rhetoric ,
and McCain / Palin suffer from the puppetry of Karl Rove .
You 've heard it all .
But where were the McCain groups ?
I knew that the ' I Hate Barack Obama ' advocates were out in the digital world , fevently regurgitating the rhetoric they heard from Fox News and Sean Hannity .

I opened Pandora 's Box .
It only took one peek into one group
before I started messaging people that had posted particularly
malevolent and / or ill conceived comments .
One person wrote , at length ,
that if Senator Obama
were to be elected president , we would have our first Arab - American
president , not Black .
They went on to give detail about the senator's
heritage and how ' Baracka ' and ' Hussein ' are Arabic words .
My message
was respectful , but my tongue is sore from repeated biting .
I informed
her that she was partly right on the Arabic origins of his name , but
completely wrong on his heritage .
Courteously , like a teacher might
explain , I detailingly informed the individual that Senator Obama's
father was from Kenya and the national language
of that country is Swahili .
Swahili is a very unique language in that
it has shared trading routes with Arab speaking communities for
centuries .
Through language borrowing , Swahili
borrowed many words from Arabic for things the people of Swahili
speaking countries did not have .
In all , approximately 50 % of Swahili
is borrowed Arabic words , but the borrowings abide to Swahili grammar ,
not Arabic .

I then told her that an ' Arab ' is defined as someone with Arabic as
their first language and being from a nation with Arabic as its official
language .
It has nothing -- nothing -- to do with Islam , or being Muslim .
This confusion surprises me .
It 's no different than assuming that
Americans are evangelical .
Furthermore , I reminded her that a name is
hardly relevant to a candidates ability to preside .
If anything , it
highlights racist undertones .
So , my call is to you , the reader .
Stop these people by being the
voice needed .
And if you do so , do n't insult them .
Resist calling them
names .
That is typically their game and we can be better than that .
Inform the world with polite smiles throughout and their anger will
only reveal their vulnerability .
Please contact these people and let them know where they are wrong .
Provide them with links to websites where they can find referenced
data .
It is all our responsibility to run this nation .
It has never
just been up to one man .
The current turmoil rests on the shoulders of
the world .

The Washington Post devoted front - page space Sunday to a lengthy investigation of John McCain 's famous temper - starting with a shouting - and - shoving match McCain had with Sen.
Charles Grassley , R - Iowa , in early 1992 .
That reminded me of the first time I ever met McCain , in the fall of 1993 .
There was no shoving , but he definitely showed flashes of anger .
McCain was visiting Portland to speak at a political dinner , and he clearly was n't happy to be doing it .
Back in 1991 , McCain had agreed to help out a small conservative group , the Oregon Citizens Alliance , which had decided not to run a third - party candidate against then - Sen .
Bob Packwood , R - Ore .
In 1992 , however , the OCA ran an anti-gay ballot measure that attracted national attention and turned even many Republicans away from the group .
After McCain agreed to attend the 1993 fundraiser for the OCA , an Arizona newspaper columnist headlined it this way : " Hate group finds friend in McCain . "
Then - Sen. Mark O. Hatfield , R - Ore. , encouraged McCain to back out , but McCain felt he could n't .
In such a situation , many politicians would simply pour on the charm and the candor - smilingly telling reporters that this was an opportunity to encourage a conservative group to be open - hearted and tolerant .
McCain did n't do that .
He worked his way through a crowd of reporters as quickly as he could , sarcastically turning aside their questions .
When asked if he was concerned about speaking to a group like the OCA , McCain replied , " No , are you ? "
When asked if he was worried about being labeled anti-gay , he said , " I do n't think I need to respond to that stupid question . "
McCain was more diplomatic in front of the OCA members , delivering a carefully worded speech that reminded listeners that the U.S. is " not only a Christian nation " and that , " We must be careful to prevent the false perception that Republicans have constituted themselves as the private advocacy group of only some Americans , be they of one economic class , one race , one religion or of one particular character . ''
At the end , OCA Chairman Lon Mabon could say he found nothing to disagree with in the speech and McCain hustled back to the airport .
I 'll leave it to others to decide what to make of his OCA apperance ( I 'm including two old clips after the jump ; one of my coverage of the event and a later piece I wrote back when I did a Sunday analysis column , in the pre-internet days ) .
However , I do n't think there is any doubt that McCain 's temperament could be a major issue in the presidential race .
McCain himself noted in a 2002 memoir ( written after his 2000 presidential race ) that , " I have a temper , to state the obvious , which I have tried to control with varying degrees of success because it does not always serve my interest or the public's .
" ARIZONA SENATOR SPEAKS ON TOLERANCE AT OCA DINNER

Tuesday , August 31 , 1993
Arizona Sen . John McCain walked a fine political line Monday when he appeared at a fund - raising dinner for the Oregon Citizens Alliance .
He gently admonished the group to observe the ``essence of tolerance . ''
The Republican senator , under fire from gay activists back home for aiding the OCA , never directly addressed the group 's sponsorship of several anti-gay - rights ballot measures .
But McCain made it clear that , while he is a conservative , he has a different perspective on the issue .
`
` We must be careful to prevent the false perception that Republicans have constituted themselves as the private advocacy group of only some Americans , '' McCain said , ``be they of one economic class , one race , one religion or of one particular character . ''
About 30 gay - rights activists picketed McCain 's appearance at the Portland Airport Holiday Inn .
``For a Republican like McCain to help an organization that is the most divisive in the state and the most divisive in the Republican Party is a real slap in the face , '' said protestor Lee Coleman , a member of Log Cabin Oregon , a group of gay Republicans .
McCain , who spoke to about 350 OCA activists at the $ 30 - a- person dinner , turned aside any such criticism in brief interviews with reporters .
``I do n't think I need to respond to that stupid question , '' McCain said to one reporter who asked if he feared he would be labeled as anti-gay by his appearance .
McCain told another reporter that the Republican Party should be open to anyone -- including homosexuals -- ``who share the principles and philosophy of Abraham Lincoln . ''
McCain stuck to the text of a carefully written speech that seemed designed to avoid offending his hosts while answering critics who say the senator was aligning himself with the OCA 's agenda .
``Tolerance does not require us to approve or adopt or support all the various forms which the pursuit of happiness will take in a diverse population , '' McCain said .
The senator was recently active in crafting the ``do n't ask - do n't tell ' ' policy in regard to gays in the military but has otherwise largely stayed away from the issue during his political career .
McCain also noted that he was in the opposition when the Arizona Republican Party several years ago endorsed a resolution declaring the United States to be a Christian nation .
``I am a Christian , '' McCain said , ``and devotion to my faith is integral to my own pursuit of happiness .
But we are not only a Christian nation . ''
OCA Chairman Lon Mabon said he did n't see any criticism -- veiled or otherwise -- in McCain 's remarks .
``I took his comments as basic comments most American citizens would agree with , '' Mabon said .
Mabon , who said he hoped to raise at least $ 3,000 from the event , announced that the money would go toward strengthening the group 's legal expertise so it can ``take on the ACLU whenever they attack our values . ''
Mabon said the OCA would also focus next year on trying to elect more like - minded candidates to office .
``We are going to be prepared for the primaries in 1994 , '' he said .
McCain 's appearance came a year after he and other Senate Republican leaders met with OCA officials to discourage them from running a third - party candidate against Sen.
Bob Packwood , R - Ore .
Mabon said no deal was struck but the senators agreed to ``work with '' the OCA .
Mabon said McCain had told him during Monday 's visit that Sen.
Phil Gramm , R - Texas , had sent ``his best wishes to the OCA '' and would be coming out at a future time to address the group .

MCCAIN MET OBLIGATION , LEFT QUICKLY

Sunday , September 5 , 1993
You know the old moral about what a tangled web you weave when you practice to deceive .
The same is true in politics when you deliver on a deal that is n't supposed to be a deal .
Well , that 's what Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , must be thinking after his speech to the Oregon Citizens Alliance last week in Portland .
From start to go , the whole thing was n't any fun for for McCain .
Privately , some of his staffers took to calling it the ``invitation from hell , '' according to one well - placed source .
Of course , a lot of Republican politicians in Oregon have found that out when they 've tried to accommodate the OCA .
McCain first met OCA Chairman Lon Mabon and one of his sidekicks , former gubernatorial candidate Al Mobley , a year ago in Washington .
Mabon and Mobley were given an audience with several GOP senators to talk about the OCA 's threat to run a third - party candidate against Oregon Sen. Bob Packwood .
Who knows how serious Mabon was about a third - party race , but he managed to use his threat to wangle some serious face - time with a bevy of Republican senators .
Afterward , Mabon said the OCA would stay in the Republican Party but that no deal was cut .
Of course , no signed - in - blood deal needed to be made .
You can be more subtle than that in politics .
For their part , the senators promised that , sure , they'd be willing to help out after the election , come out to speak to your group .
Heck , that 's what politicians do , go around speaking to groups .
Of course , this meeting was before the OCA got its national reputation for last fall 's anti-gay ballot measure .
All of a sudden , the OCA was being demonized in no less than the pages of The New York Times .
According to one source who talked to McCain , the Arizona senator did n't realize the notoriety the OCA has attracted in the gay - rights community when he accepted the speaking invitation this spring .
Sen . Mark Hatfield , R - Ore. , who is himself an open critic of the OCA , tried to talk McCain out of it , but McCain said he could n't back out of it .
Clearly , McCain felt bound by the signals the Republican senators sent Mabon and Mobley in their D.C. meeting .
When the pending speech hit the Arizona news media , McCain was pilloried by gay - rights activists .
A McCain relative 's business was threatened with a boycott and one Arizona Republic column on the affair was headlined : ``Hate group finds friend in McCain . ''
The senator himself met with Arizona leaders of the NAACP and the American Jewish Committee to smooth things over and put out the word he would talk to the OCA about ``tolerance . ''
Thus , we find McCain taking a 1,200 - mile detour to Portland last Monday instead of going home to Phoenix after he had been with a U.S. delegation that met with Mexico 's president over the weekend .
In Portland , McCain was greeted by protesters at the airport and at the front of the Airport Holiday Inn .
When he reached the entrance , a reporter shoved a tape recorder at him and asked if he was concerned about speaking to a group with the OCA 's reputation .
`` No , are you ? '' growled McCain as he race - walked into the drab ballroom ahead of OCA Chairman Lon Mabon .
From the head table , McCain grudgingly took a few more questions from reporters , although he clearly did n't want to say much directly about the gay - rights issue that has made the OCA 's national reputation .
McCain quickly got a first - hand flavor for the OCA .
Marylin Shannon , the vice chairwoman of the Oregon GOP , had a spot on the program to give an opening prayer .
In short order , she praised the Grants Pass woman accused of shooting an abortion doctor in Wichita and thanked the Lord ``for Lon Mabon and the vision you put in his heart . ''
Once McCain got into his speech , he stuck to the text like a Talmudic scholar .
He told the OCA that Republicans have to be careful to not be seen as the ``private advocacy group of only some Americans ' ' and that they should observe the ``essence of tolerance . ''
You could read it as a message that the OCA should change its focus and be more tolerant of gays .
Or maybe not .
Mabon was able to say plausibly he did n't see anything critical in McCain 's remarks .
Instead , Mabon seemed as ebullient with reporters as McCain was testy .
He used the evening to issue a stream of new marching orders for the OCA .
He said the group would be a player in next year 's legislative races and promised that if Hatfield ran again in 1996 , ``I do n't think he 'll have a free and easy primary like he has had in the past . ''
Maybe McCain can take that message back to Mark and his other Senate colleagues .
Of course , McCain did n't seem to want to learn too much about the OCA 's varied projects .
While Mabon and McCain sat together at the head table , Mabon said they never did discuss the OCA 's initiatives on homosexuality .
They also apparently did n't talk about the OCA 's attempts to recall several Republican legislators .
McCain himself was n't available afterward .
He rushed out of the banquet at the end -- stiffing reporters ' questions -- to get the next flight out .
It must have felt good to slip between the sheets of his own bed when he finally made it back to Phoenix that night .
Man Torches Venue to Delay Wedding
Choosing the one you love and want to spend the rest of your life with can be difficult , especially when you are already married and have a date set for a second separate wedding .
Tatsuhiko Kawada , a 39 year - old married man , had been seeing a woman outside of his marriage for about 3 years .
Kawada has promised his girlfriend that he would marry her and even set the date , but found he could not decide whether or not he wanted to marry the girlfriend or stay with his wife .
The night before the ceremony was to take place , Kawada poured gasoline in an employee entrance hall and then set fire to it with his cigarette lighter .
Around 8 square meters of the hotel was burned and Kawada was arrested the following day on arson and trespassing charges .
‘‘ I started the fire because of circumstances that made it impossible for me to go through with the wedding . ” said Kawada to the police .
I am curious who he will call to have come and bail him out of jail though …

Let me just come out and say it : I hate the new iGoogle .
And I want my old home page back .
As you may know , I ’m generally fond of many of Google ’s offerings .
But this change is just godawful , and it ’s on a service that I ( and many others ) really depend on throughout the day .
And I ’m far from alone in my sentiment .
A Downgrade
The problem , to put it simply , is that the new iGoogle looks and functions like a downgrade from the last one .
Honestly , if someone just showed it to me with no context , I would have taken it for an old alpha version of the service .
There ’s suddenly a huge amount of clutter , wasted space , and missing features .
The new left navigation bar eats up valuable screen real estate and serves as a general annoyance .
If some people prefer that to the small top bar navigation that used to be there , fine — but how about a choice instead of a forced change ?
The new iGoogle also gets rid of the ability to show story headlines with the option to get an expanded summary within the widgets .
You used to be able to see the headlines alone , then click on a “ + ” to see a short summary of any given article .
Now , you are limited to the choice of headlines only — with no expansion capability — or a full summary for every headline on the page , which adds to the clutter problem .
The “ Advantage ”
The new configuration ’s only real “ advantage , ” if you want to call it that , is the fact that you can now view any widget in a full - page mode .
To me , that ’s absolutely not the purpose of this utility .
If I want to view something in a full - page mode , I can open it in another tab .
I use my iGoogle page to get a quick glimpse of content at an easy glance , then decide where to go .
If I want full - page in - window reading , I ’d go to Google Reader .
The Real Reason ?
But therein underscores what may be the ultimate reason for the change :
The now - unavoidable full - page mode allows providers to place ads or other revenue - generating material within their content , whereas the previous non -full - page widget with optional expansion did not .
It ’s a benefit for the advertisers at the expense of the users .
Come on , Google .
You guys are better than this .
Give me my goddamned home page back — or at least give me the option to choose between the two .
This is a downright downgrade from a user perspective , and you know it as well as I do .
i Google Update : Did Google Listen to the Complaints ?
The expanding program in Barcelona is typical of so - called third - generation programs , which rely heavily on technology .
( In its first generation , bike - sharing involved scattering old bikes around the streets , where they could be used for free ; second - generation programs accepted coins . )
Here , a customer buys a yearly membership for about $ 30 and is issued a smart card that allows the rider to remove a bike from a mechanized dock .
The first 30 minutes are free , with a charge of 30 cents per half - hour after that .
A bike must be returned to any bike rack in the network within two hours or the card may be deactivated .
Most programs in Germany and Austria work on a different system ; members receive cellphone text messages providing codes to unlock the bikes .
Copenhagen and Amsterdam have had devoted bicycling commuters for many years .
But the new programs have created the greatest transportation revolution in central and southern Europe , where warmer climates allow riders to ride comfortably year - round .
The shared bicycles in Barcelona , Lyon and Paris are heavily used , logging about 10 rides a day , according to officials in these cities .
In North America , issues like insurance liability , a stronger car culture , longer commutes and a preference for wearing helmets have slowed adoption of bicycle - sharing programs .
None of the European programs require helmets .
Still , Washington and Montreal are experimenting with small projects , and Chicago , Boston and New York are studying options .
Perhaps the best indication that bicycle - sharing has arrived is this : Shanghai , which 10 years ago was trying to eliminate bicycles from some of its boulevards to make way for cars , opened a pilot bike - sharing stand last month .
In most European cities , advertisers have been given contracts to set up and maintain bicycle - sharing programs in exchange for the rights to sell advertisements on city - owned structures like bus stations .
Below are the remarks of Craig Johnson on October 22 , 2008 , at the ACLU 's press conference on the U.S. " Constitution - free Zone . "
Good morning .
I am Craig Johnson .
I ’m an associate professor of music at Point Loma Nazarene University in San Diego , CA .
First , I want to thank you for allowing me to share my story with you .
Point Loma , I ’m proud to say , encourages its faculty and students to involve themselves in social justice and reconciliation issues .
And it was through my involvement in one such event that my story begins .
On June 1 of this year I was privileged to participate , along with my two oldest children , in a vigil sponsored by the San Diego Foundation for Change and supported by members of the Point Loma campus community at the Border Field State Park on the U. S. border with Mexico .
My involvement in this event was to demonstrate my opposition to the Federal government ’s proposed construction of a dual layer border fence through this park and the nationally protected estuary and research center that are part of the grounds .
One activity during the vigil was to have been what is known in some faith traditions as a “ love feast ” – it was to have been the sharing of food through the fence to demonstrate solidarity and hospitality between citizens of both countries .
That day , however , there was a much stronger presence of Border Patrol agents , a dozen or more , than is typical at events of this nature .
They informed us that if any food was passed through the fence , we would be arrested on violations of customs regulations .
We took them at their word and the love feast became a love lament , with only the US citizens eating while our Mexican neighbors looked on .
Incidentally , an article appeared in yesterday ’s New York Times about this park and the Border Patrol agents , and it seems that they have softened their position on this considerably .
While there was a strong presence of agents at the park itself , other officers were recording license plates of all the vehicles in the parking lot , which unfortunately was a mile and a half away .
In fact , one student ’s car was even towed for expired registration during the event .
Six days later , on June 7 , I went to Tijuana , Mexico to sing a benefit recital .
On my re-entry into the U.S. , I submitted my current passport to the Customs agent and was then told to freeze with both of my hands on the desk in front of me .
After being asked if I had any weapons on me , I was handcuffed by Customs agents and told that I was listed as “ armed and dangerous . ”
At that point I was escorted in front of literally hundreds of onlookers waiting to enter the U. S. and taken to a holding room where my suit coat , tie , outer shirt , belt , and shoes were removed , my pockets emptied and the contents confiscated and I was aggressively searched .
This was not your typical airport security pat - down .
Every inch and crack of my body was thoroughly pressed and probed .
I was in complete bewilderment .
I felt violated and frankly , I was embarrassed .
I could not believe what was happening .
After this I was questioned about my reasons for being in Mexico , my length of stay there , and where specifically I would be returning to the U. S. After about 45 minutes I was released to collect my belongings and rejoin my friends with whom I had been in line .
I normally travel to Mexico for any reason that presents itself – escorting visitors from out of town or just going down for the sights and sounds of the country .
I even worked regularly there in 2006 with Tijuana Opera and would cross the border several times per week .
Never before my June 7 experience had I encountered the slightest problem .
It took me four months to muster the courage to try crossing again .
I had hoped that this was a mistake and that I would be removed from “ armed and dangerous ” status .
On October 5 , I decided to go to Mexico to try re-entering in order put my mind to rest .
I was hoping for the best , but prepared for the worst , and once again I was subjected to the same treatment – arrest , searching , questioning , and detainment .
I do not own firearms .
I do not have a criminal record .
Yet when I think of the treatment that my own government shows to me , I am alarmed .
It ’s frightening enough knowing that my personal and private data are being accessed with unknown consequences , but when I know what some of those consequences are , I am even more disturbed .
It took me four months to return to Mexico after June 1 , not because I ’m afraid of travelling outside of my own country , but rather because I ’m afraid of returning home .
This should not be .
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - High definition Blu-ray disc players may be one of the holiday season ’s best sellers , but they will still fall short of expectations , due to the tough economy , the head of Sony ’s U.S. electronics unit said .
Sales of the next - generation movies players , developed by Sony and sold under brands including Panasonic and Samsung , could benefit from a late shopping spurt as budget conscious U.S. consumers find deals , Stan Glasgow told Reuters in an interview on Thursday .
But they will not meet the worldwide target of 5 million units , most of which had been expected to sell in the United States .
“ It ’s not that far off of it , ” he said .
“ Maybe 10 percent off of what we had thought .
It ’s truly one of the items that has performed well during this economic mess . ”
After the U.S. Thanksgiving holiday on November 27 , electronics retailers are expected to slash prices of Blu-ray players -- which originally sold for as high as $ 1,500 in 2006 , -- to as low as $ 150 per unit , experts said .
Sales of Blu-ray players , which promise higher quality video and audio to viewers with HD televisions , have been hampered by retail prices on movie discs , which can top $ 30 a piece .
Glasgow suggested that discounted prices for movies could jump - start player sales .
“ They ( movie studios ) need to make money , and the packaged media ( discs ) is a critical way for them to make money so I understand their problems also , ” he said .
“ But I ’d love to see those prices come down , as well as the price of Blu-ray players , to drive adoption . ”
While the new disc standard has enjoyed near exclusivity on electronics retailers shelves this year , after Toshiba Corp pulled the plug on its HD - DVD format earlier this year , Blu-ray still has a long way to go to match sales of standard DVD players .
Although the segment is in decline , global DVD player and recorder sales reached 142 million units in 2007 , according to research firm In - Stat .
The holiday shopping season is expected to be tough for the entire consumer electronics sector , with shoppers perhaps unwilling to spend after watching the turmoil in the banking , retail and automotive sectors .
Glasgow said earlier on Thursday he doubted that the gadget industry would reach the 3.5 percent growth forecasted by the Consumer Electronics Association for the fourth quarter .
That sluggishness is due in part a slowdown in sales of flat panel , high definition television , such as Sony ’s Bravia line .
“ We expected the TV industry to just skyrocket this holiday season .
It ’s going to grow , but its not skyrocketing , ” he said .
“ There are less consumers ... willing to spend money .
I believe 80 percent of that is just consumer confidence .
They do n’t feel as comfortable making a major investment in a television . ”
Still , Glasgow thinks that some companies like Sony , established multinational concerns with access to credit , will take advantage of developmental opportunities now that some of their competitors are struggling , in hopes of making more innovative products in the long run .
“ Its a good time to reevaluate .
I think Sony is in a good position to do that . ”
As many of you may or may not know , I have been around this old globe for 57 years now .
I am not bragging when I tell you I have just about seen everything there is to see this place can offer .
With that said , I ’ve had my share of relationships in my lifetime and I can tell you I now know of some tell - tale signs when a relationship has about run it ’s course .
I am going through this right now in my current relationship of 12 years .
Trust me I know it ’s about over , which led me to offer up at least 10 ways when a relationship is done .
Here we go :
1 ) When you have a heart attack , and your significant other drops you off at the emergency room .
I know it sounds cold - blooded , but hey , it ’s a cold world .
2 ) When you call your significant other , and she hangs up on you .
This is never a good sign , especially if she calls back and she sounds like she ’s in a well and she speaking in a whisper .
Sort of makes you wonder what the hotel room looks like .
3 ) When she makes sure that you have limited contact with her family .
Look , why would she want you to talk to them especially if things are over with ?
4 ) Oh I do n’t even need to talk about the sex thing do I ?
If she has n’t shaven for an entire month and also claims to have been on her period for 27 days of last month , that ’s a pretty good sign that she is in no mood to be touched by you at least .
5 ) If she has more fun at work than she does at home , that ’s a clear sign things are n’t good .
Today we went back to Central Standard Time from Daylight Savings Time and I thought my significant other was going to climb the walls at 6:30 PM .
She was extremely bored and i knew she could n’t wait to get to work with her friends .
6 ) If you and your significant other begin fighting over little things like , who will pass the salt , then yeah , it is pretty much over because communication begins to break down quickly .
7 ) If you start talking about splitting up the joint checking account , she needs to start buying her own insurance , and basically fending for herself ..it ’s over .
8 ) If you pass each other in the hallway and give each other a go to hell look , that ’s a pretty good sign to start looking for another place to live .
9 ) If when you touch her ( for some God unknown reason ) and she feels like the tip of an iceberg , life has gone from the relationship .
I am amazed when she asks “ What ’s wrong with you ? ”
Hahahaha like there ’s something wrong with me ????
10 ) If all three dogs that you have been feeding for ten years start to growl at you when they see you , she has probably turned even them against your sorry ass .
Take shelter ( different shelter ) soon !
I hope this helps you if you are in this situation .
Life is difficult enough , but I also know that life is precious .
If you are in a bad relationship , get out .
Life is too short , and who knows , there maybe someone else out there that shaves their legs !
10 Of The Most Bizarre Medical Practices And Theories
Urine therapy
Exactly what it says on the tin , this is therapy that involves urine and quite often your own .
Mmm …Delicious urine .
Urine has been used as a curative in both the medical and cosmetic world and in many cultures and eras , which have included the Romans , the Renaissance period , China , India and France and is still a predominant theory in Western culture to this day .
Its uses number in the many : teeth - whitening , skin protection , acne cure , strep throat and broken bones to name a few .
Sometimes the urine is ingested directly , whilst other times the urine is made into a poultice or directly placed on the skin .
Hilariously , a lot of “ insane ” medical theories and / or practices have since been discontinued or debunked , yet we still have people that believe in the positive and healing benefits bestowed upon them by drinking their own piss .
Children ’s soothing syrups
Do you have a particularly annoying and rambunctious child , or perhaps your child is experiencing problems during the teething stage ?
Never fear , Mrs. Winslow ’s Soothing Syrup is here !
Designed to calm and relax whoever – or whatever – it was given to , it left the parent free to carry on with their daily lives , uninterrupted by the incessant bawling of an upset child .
You ’re damn right it had better relax them , what you would have just given your child was a deadly cocktail that included morphine , cannabis , heroin , powdered opium and a mixture of other crazy substances .
Not only would it totally mellow out a child , but quite often said child would wind up dead .
Still , I guess dead = calm , so you could n’t sue for false advertising .
Mercury
“ I do n’t feel well … Better ingest some mercury .
Mmm… Mercury ” .
Sound like a particularly good advert for a cure - all ?
It might not now , but it certainly would have appealed in the past .
Mercury has even been found in Egyptian tombs dating as far back as 1500 BC .
Mercury was believed to cure ailments , heal wounds , prolong life and a whole bunch of other things .
One Chinese emperor - Qin Shi Huang - was so obsessed with seeking an elixir for eternal life , that he ingested a mercury compound that was given to him by his doctors and scientists .
Ironically , the very mixture that was designed to give him eternal life ended up killing him .
Heroin for coughs
Most of us understand that the drug heroin is indeed not very good for us , and for some of us ( not me ) it provides a decent income .
However , I ’m sure all of us will balk at the prospect of it being marketed as something to take for simple coughs and wheezes , whilst at the same time being said to be “ non-addictive ” .
But this is exactly what the German pharmaceutical company Bayer ( to this day , a very successful company ) did at the end of the 19 th century and for some of the 20 th century .
Got a cough ?
Here , indulge in some heroin , my dear .
Heroin was also marketed as something that could treat morphine addiction , but shortly afterwards the company faced slight embarrassment when it was found that heroin is metabolized into morphine in the human body , thus making their product a faster - acting form of morphine .
Electrical impotence cures
Back in the late 19 th century , inventors and medical practitioners alike simply loved to peddle their “ miracle cures ” and strange devices that would heal a whole host of commonplace problems ; male impotence being one of them .
Being great believers in the fact that electricity could bring a certain “ energy ” into the human body , they presumed it could work wonders for the impotence - afflicted man .
Designed to “ shock ” weak parts of the body back into life via the gentle application of electrical currents , I can imagine it now : “ Step right up , step right up , come and try the Magnificent Virility Belt !
You there , do n’t be shy !
I ’m even wearing one myself now , just watch as I turn it on and prepare to be amaz - OH MY GOD THE PAIN , MAKE IT STOP ! ”
Lobotomy
Similar to trepanation , lobotomies involved the insertion of objects into the head , namely 10 inch “ ice picks ” .
From the Greek lobos and tomos , meaning “ lobe ” and “ slice / cut ” respectively , you get an idea of what it involved … Brain slicing !
Essentially , it involved the insertion of the “ ice pick ” tool through the eye socket and into the prefrontal cortex of the brain .
When the pick was in the right place , the protruding end was struck with a hammer .
So basically , you stick a long piece of metal into your brain and hit it with a hammer .
Practitioners at the time just could n’t believe that such a method resulted in mental problems far worse than those that the lobotomy was supposed to cure .
That ’s correct , brain scrambling was supposed to help with many mental illnesses , yet has been declared as being “ one of the most barbaric mistakes ever perpetrated by mainstream medicine ” .
An interesting point to note is that John F. Kennedy ’s sister Rosemary underwent a lobotomy after their father complained of her moodiness .
Unfortunately , the procedure reduced her mind to that of an infant and she was never the same again .
Bloodletting
Much as it sounds , this was the process of letting / withdrawing vast quantities of blood from the body , specifically in order to cure … Well … Just about anything .
Syphilis ?
Let some blood .
Headache ?
Let some blood ?
Kids giving you hell ?
Let some blood .
Believed to be one of the older medical practices around , spanning some 2,000 years until the late 19 th century .
In retrospect , practically bleeding oneself to death does n’t seem like the greatest of pastimes , but in those days , the belief was the blood could be used up ; it did n’t circulate as we know it does today , but rather it would stagnate in certain parts of the body , causing illness .
The other key belief was that the body contained four substances ( called humours ) , which consisted of such tasty - sounding things as blood , black bile , yellow bile and phlegm .
An excess or shortage of any of these substances would result in illness .
So naturally , the best cure was to let some out if there was too much of any one humour .
Trepanning
Really just a fancy word for taking a drill to your head and seeing what happens , trepanation was de rigueur for head - related illnesses both mental and physical for an incredibly long time , as evidence suggests that such surgery has been performed for as long as there have been head / brain - related illness and injuries to treat .
Nowadays it would ( hopefully ) sound ludicrous to believe that literally drilling a hole in someone ’s head would think that it would “ let bad spirits out ” and thus cure the patient of their particular ailment .
Ear candles
Unfortunately , not the practice of turning someone ’s ears into candles for your own personal health benefits or amusement , but more the practice of sticking a long candle in your ear to clear it of wax , debris and crustaceans .
Apparently , the candle causes negative pressure and draws the wax , etc. out from the ear canal , thus making it a cleaner place .
Unsurprisingly , in actuality the candle does little to nothing and can even result in – surprise , surprise – wax from the candle entering the ear canal , doing more harm than good , as is what happened to the poor person that burnt to death when the candle set their house on fire .
Putting it bluntly , sticking candles in your ear and expecting it to do great things is something akin to a 2 year old finding a crayon on the floor and jamming it in their nose because it seemed like a good idea at the time .
Psychic surgery
Like most things relating to “ psychic ” or “ paranormal ” happenings , this practice has since been found to be utter rubbish and a ” total hoax ” .
Psychic surgery was first noticed in the Philippines and Brazil in the 1940s and 50s and garnering many US tabloid headlines when comedian Andy Kaufman underwent a six - week course of psychic surgery in March 1984 to help treat his lung cancer .
Shortly after , Kaufman died of lung cancer .
The idea behind the surgery was that the “ surgeon ” ( a man with no medical training ) would cut open the patient using his bare hands , merely tracing a line with a finger or hand and a wound would appear , painlessly .
The surgeon would then remove tumors and other assorted gore , claiming to have removed “ the illness ” , “ bad spirits ” or some other foolishness .
Do n’t get me wrong , but the idea of a man cutting me open WITH HIS HANDS and then removing stuff seemingly at random , does n’t put me at ease .
It was then discovered that psychic surgeons were basically magicians playing a confidence game with their patients , using sleight of hand to make people believe they were removing “ bad stuff ” when really they were just pretending to .
Kind of like dentists today … Maybe .

As the price of silver pulled back under $ 10 an ounce recently , I started loading up on the white metal .
Or , I should say , I tried to load up .
While I was easily able to buy silver coins with numismatic value , my first attempts to buy silver bullion coins met with frustration .
I think this says a lot about the silver market right now .
On paper , it �s cheap .
But in the real , physical market , silver is getting very precious indeed .
In fact , if you can buy silver bullion for under $ 10 an ounce , I recommend you grab it and run !
Hi -yo , Silver !
Maybe you have your own stories of the silver rush to share .
Here�s how things are going for me .
First , my success .
I was able to buy some 1921 Morgan Silver Dollars from Eastern Numismatics ( http://www.uscoins.com ) at a pretty good price .
I say that because I checked eBay , where 1921 Morgan Silver Dollars for VF and AU ( very fine and almost uncirculated quality ) were selling for higher prices .
But with silver under $ 10 , I knew that while numismatics ( rare ) coins were good , this was an even better time to buy bullion .
So , I checked a couple of my local favorite gold / silver shops .
At the first one , I was told that silver bullion coins ( I asked for silver Eagles ) were unavailable .
At the second one , I was told they were available , but �not at any price you�ll want to pay . �
How much was that ?
Oh , about 60 % more than I expected to pay .
� That �s outrageous ! �
I sputtered .
� Call me next week , � the dealer told me .
� Maybe we�ll have more then .�
So then I turned to the Internet .
I decided to buy some bullion coins straight from Pan American Silver ( PAAS ) .
This company has mines in Peru , Mexico and Bolivia , and development projects all over the place .
It also sells its coins and bars , minted at the Northwest Territorial Mint ( http://www.nwtmint.com ) .
While its coins may not be as well known as silver Eagles or Maple Leafs , I think most gold / silver dealers would recognize them pretty easily .
I called a couple of times , but couldn�t connect with anyone but a recorded message that said the mint was overwhelmed with call volume so no one was answering the phone .
In frustration , last Friday , I wrote an email to the Northwest Territorial Mint , asking how I could buy 1 - ounce silver rounds ( coins ) from them immediately .
Later that day , the mint wrote back .
The message said , in part : � We have been experiencing an unprecedented volume of sales , and we have been unable to answer each call in person as we would prefer .
We are adding to our bullion sales and customer service staff and upgrading our telephone systems to better respond to customer inquiries .
� When you reach one of our bullion sales representatives by phone , you can lock in your purchase at the current market price .
However , please note that most of the precious metal bullion products we produce currently have a 12 - to - 16 - week lead time before delivery . �
The email went on to say �
� Because the United States Mint and the Royal Canadian Mint have significantly curtailed distribution of their bullion products until 2009 , we are quoting delivery of new orders for American Eagle coins and Canadian Maple Leaf coins into March 2009 . �
A 12 - to - 16 week lead time for delivery ?
Un - freaking - real .
And while that may sound crazy , it pales compared to the lunacy of not being able to get American Eagles and Canadian Maple Leaf coins until March of next year !
And it�s not like it�s the mint�s fault � they �re working as hard as they can and adding staff .
Tell me again about the surplus of silver .
That �s a good one .
Physical Silver versus Paper Silver
Of course , there is a difference between minted silver rounds and 1 - or 10 - ounce bars on the one hand , and silver you can buy with a futures contract on the COMEX on the other hand .
A silver futures contract is for 5,000 ounces , or 1,000 ounces for a mini-contract .
While you can take delivery of a futures contract , who the heck would want to do that ?
Well , David Morgan , that �s who .
He�s an independent precious metals analyst and the founder of silver - investor.com .
He also writes a blog at http://silverblogspot.blogspot.com .
Silver coins and smaller bars may be harder to find right now , but certain forces are at work that may soon affect prices and availablility .
Morgan and I met on a tour of mines belonging to Endeavour Silver and Great Panther in Mexico , and I found him extremely knowledgeable about silver , its history and trends .
So , I called him up and asked him what he was seeing in the physical market .
And it turns out that what he�s seeing is making him more bullish � so bullish , he bought a 1,000 - ounce mini silver future contract and took delivery .
Morgan says he�s not the only one doing arbitrage between the paper and physical silver markets .
He said entrepreneurs could �take advantage of the discrepancy between physical and paper silver � these people could take gold and silver off the exchanges at the spot price and turn it into gold and silver coins and reap the large premium now available .�
Maybe that will ease the pressure in the physical silver market , and make coins and smaller bars readily available again .
The Bulls and the Bears
There are both bullish and bearish forces at work in the silver market right now .
The interesting thing is that the bearish forces seem to be at work in the paper ( futures ) market , and the bullish forces are at work in the physical market .
Let �s sum up some of those forces �
Bearish Forces �
1 ) Fear of a global slowdown .
Silver is an industrial metal as well as a precious metal .
And while the global economy was hot , silver demand soared .
Last year , industrial demand for silver jumped 7.2 % to a record of 455.3 million ounces .
But the global economy is slowing into recession , and that slowdown could last well into next year .
The International Monetary Fund forecasts a reduction in global growth to 3 % in 2009 from 5 % in 2007 .
If there is any single force that can send the price of silver lower , an economic slowdown is probably the one .
2 ) Mine production .
Before the global economy started to slump , global silver production was expected to grow by 6.5 % in 2008 , faster than last year�s increase of between 3.6 % and 4.1 % .
But that was then .
Now , thanks to the slowing global economy , mines are closing .
You see , two - thirds of the world�s silver is produced as a byproduct of other metals .
For example , Oz Minerals is cutting zinc production at its Golden Grove Mine Australia by 35 % .
But that mine also produced over 3.1 million ounces of silver in 2007 .
So , if the global economy worsens , we�re likely to see silver production go down , and perhaps sharply lower .
3 ) Selling by big funds .
As the global markets careen into the mother of all financial crises , hedge funds have been imploding one after another like overheated Christmas bulbs .
And it�s not just hedge funds � whole trading desks have disappeared .
This has removed a lot of the paper demand for silver .
And liquidation in silver futures has been a drag on prices .
On the bright side , hedge fund liquidation won�t go on forever .
Silver will find a new base , and use that to head higher .
Now let �s look at some bullish forces � Bullish Forces 1 ) Supply / Demand Squeeze .
Did I say there was an increase in silver mine supply ?
Well , that �s true .
But there�s also an increase in demand .
Goldfields Mineral Services recently estimated that current world silver bullion stocks of coins and silverware stand at a mere 400 million ounces .
That �s down from more than 2 billion ounces in the late 1980s .
2 ) Investor Demand is accelerating .
The iShares Silver Trust has already seen a massive increase of silver accumulation since 2006 � over 220 million ounces .
Take a look at this chart �
This and other silver ETFs in London and Zurich have made it easy for investors to move in and out of silver .
3 ) Silver is cheap compared to gold .
The price of gold recently traded at 82 times the price of silver .
This is about 36 % higher than the ratio over the past eight years , and looking back over history , the ratio is closer to 20 to 1 .
If we return closer to historical ratio , the price of gold would have to go way down , or silver would have to go way , way up .
Why is the gold - silver ratio out of historical whack ?
It goes back to silver as an industrial metal : Investors are terrified that a global economic slowdown will dampen demand for silver in batteries , superconductors and other electronic components , so they�ve dumped silver futures overboard .
But that conflicts with silver as a precious metal � the global economic crisis is causing more investors ( like me ) to buy physical silver as a refuge of safety .
After all , Central Banks around the world are flooding the financial system with trillions of dollars � a money deluge worthy of Noah � to try and douse the four - alarm financial fire that is the credit crisis .
Give them their due ; they�ve actually blunted the worst of the immediate threat .
The problem is this threat is ongoing , and it could get much worse from here .
And that makes physical gold AND silver look even better to me .
These two worlds � the paper world and the physical world � are going to collide .
While I think the shortage of physical silver coins and bars will ease down the road , I think the most bullish forces in silver are yet to come .
I think the physical world will win out over the paper world � and silver could go much higher .
The Best of Both Worlds Don�t worry about my quest for physical silver ; by the time you read this , I�ll have more locked up .
As for your own portfolio and investment needs , I think a little physical silver never hurts .
And there�s an investment that combines the best of physical and paper silver � the iShares Silver Trust ( SLV ) .
It owns physical silver and issues shares against its treasure hoard .
Sure , in this volatile market , it could go lower .
But if , like me , you think the price of silver is going higher in the longer term , then the SLV looks cheap right now .

Bill Clinton campaigns against GOP ' firewall ' in Georgia David Edwards
Published : Wednesday November 19 , 2008
Print This Email This Several thousand supporters showed up on a cold Georgia night to see former President Bill Clinton speak in support of Jim Martin .
Martin , the Democratic candidate for U.S. Senate , will go up against Republican incumbent Saxby Chambliss in a Dec. 2 runoff election .
Chambliss has warned that Republicans need control of the seat to block an " out of control " Democratic Congress .
Clinton argued that times call for unity instead of division .
" This country does n't need a firewall against the future .
It needs a bridge to the future , " he said .
" One of the problems that I had when I became president , " he added , " is that , over and over , we got a lot done in my first two years , but we could n't pass health care reform and could n't do one or two other things , because of the Republican filibuster in the Senate . "
Democrats moved closer to a filibuster - proof majority on Tuesday when Democrat and Anchorage mayor Mark Begich was declared the winner in his bid against Republican Sen .
Ted Stevens .
With the win in Alaska , Democrats have 58 seats .
60 votes are required to prevent a filibuster in the Senate .
" We do n't need a firewall , " Clinton said .
" We need a bridge .
Martin is the bridge and Chambliss is the firewall .
This is not rocket science .
You have to decide what you want . "
Chambliss won his Senate seat in 2002 when he defeated Max Cleland .
Democrats say that Chambliss ran a dishonest ad against Cleland , a Vietnam veteran and triple amputee , painting as him soft on terrorism .
The former president did n't seem willing to forget Cleland 's ad .
" I saw somebody wanting a Senate seat so bad , so bad they would say that [ Cleland ] endangered the national security of the country , " Clinton lamented .

UNPRECEDENTED RAPE OF THE AMERICAN PEOPLE UNDERWAY IN DC
PART 1 of 2
By : Devvy
November 13 , 2008
ï¿½ 2008 - NewsWithViews.com
Rape is an ugly word usually attributed to an attack on a woman .
It also means an act of plunder , violent seizure , or abuse ; despoliation ; violation : the rape of the countryside .
There is no other word to describe what has been happening in Washington , DC. , for the past two and a half months .
The so - called bail out of lending institutions and banks has turned into a free for all that is mind boggling , already running in the TRILLIONS with no end in sight .
As the layers have been unfolding over the past few weeks , only someone in complete denial can say with a straight face that this unconstitutional looting of the people 's labor has been anything but mass rape .
The Fed is thumbing their nose at Congress : Nov. 10 ( Bloomberg ) --
" The Federal Reserve is refusing to identify the recipients of almost $ 2 trillion of emergency loans from American taxpayers or the troubled assets the central bank is accepting as collateral .
Fed Chairman Ben S. Bernanke and Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson said in September they would comply with congressional demands for transparency in a $ 700 billion bailout of the banking system .
Two months later , as the Fed lends far more than that in separate rescue programs that did n't require approval by Congress , Americans have no idea where their money is going or what securities the banks are pledging in return . "
Congress foolishly gave the privately owned " FED " and Treasury total power with the bail out deal and now they 're getting their noses rubbed in it .
Lending institutions who received all this borrowed , worthless paper called a ' bail out ' or ' rescue plan ' are spending the sweat off your back like there 's no tomorrow on big bonuses and lavish events , while Congress sits around scratching their backsides .
Congress has let the genie out of the bottle and they 're now running around like the nitwits they are trying to shore up this disaster of their own making .
Congress never had the authority to to rob and plunder the people 's empty purse for what has turned into a never ending bail out bonanza .
Congress has no right to steal from you via heavier and heavier taxation to bail out , rescue or make loans to companies in the private sector .
Well , that is until Congress , with the blessing of Bush , simply decided a little over two months ago to finally burn Art. 1 , Section 8 of the U.S. Constitution .
They have become totally lawless with zero restraints on their actions .
Congress willfully violates the U.S. Constitution now as a matter of doing business .
These crooks , including Marxist Obama and Juan McCain , have simply rubber stamped the utter and complete bankruptcy of this country .
It 's foolish at this point to try and sugar coat reality .
The raw , hard numbers are there for anyone to see .
Desperate Americans are begging for the government to bail out their industries , so they care little for the Constitution .
All they want is their bacon saved .
What they are embracing is totalitarian government .
Congress did n't bail out ENRON .
They let the seventh largest corporation with a capitalization of $ 60 billion dollars go under .
I believe the reason is 9/11 , which I have covered in other columns .
However , as the mortgage melt down became epidemic , instead of letting the market correct itself , in steps a thieving government .
Now you are making your mortgage payment and your neighbors .
As tragic as the foreclosure epidemic is , to make those of us who meet our monthly mortgage obligations and then are fleeced to pay for someone 's else 's with borrowed money is indentured servitude .
We are being forced with a gun to our head to slave for someone else 's house payment .
But wait !
Headlines , November 12 , 2008 : Treasury Secretary Paulson - bail out money not to be used to buy toxic mortgages after all !
Did you not see this 0:26 second video of a woman cheering that Obama is going to pay her mortgage and gas ?
No , you will pay and the trap has already been sprung .
What you 're seeing is one of the most dangerous precedents being set since FDR's Nazi ' New Deal . '
As if that 's not enough , today you will go to work to pay legal fees for these mortgage execs who covered up the truth about the financial sustainability of their corporations as well as : 86 % of Bailout Money Used for Executive Bonuses .
The so - called bail out is already a massive failure except for the banking cartel who got total control of our banking and lending institutions once and for all .
As we the people are trying to fight off an illegitimate president getting sworn into office , the world banking vipers are getting ready to finish the final wiring of our monetary and banking system into a global system .
It is a death knell and soon you will hear the skeleton rattle clear across this land .
Bailouts :
The wound that will keep on hemorrhaging : " In recent columns I have reminded people about the bail out for Chrysler - a ' one time ' kiss from Congress back in 1981 .
Not so fast : " Aug. 22 2008 ( Bloomberg ) -- General Motors Corp. , Ford Motor Co. , Chrysler LLC and U.S. auto - parts makers are seeking $ 50 billion in government - backed loans , double their initial request , to develop and build more fuel - efficient vehicles ... "
Next year is going to be a make - or - break year in terms of survival , '' said Mirko Mikelic , senior portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management in Grand Rapids , Michigan , which oversees $ 22 billion in assets , including GM and Ford bonds .
" Any help like these government loans would be a huge boost . ''
As I write this column , these thieves in Congress are scurrying to put together unconstitutional loan packages for the auto makers .
They wo n't make it to next year .
Who was watching the books for those companies ?
These mega corporations sold out the American worker decades ago , kicked them into the unemployment lines and gave American jobs to foreign countries like commie China .
Now they want the sweat off your back to fund their mistakes .
These big auto makers have known for years their losses were in the tens of billions of dollars and could not be sustained .
That 's when they should have closed their foreign plants , down sized and employed Americans in what ever factories they could keep open here in America .
Of course it would help if the parking lots at GM and Ford were n't filled with employee cars made by Toyota and other foreign companies .
Now , they 're demanding you and I bail them out even though Congress has NO authority to be a loan operation for the private sector .
That 's not the big story .
A ton of this borrowed money will be to fund pensions .
125,000 for Chrysler and 500,000 for GM .
These corporations made these obligations living beyond their means to operate and now they want unconstitutional loans .
What a horrific mess created by greedy corporations who now want you , me and our children to bail out their greed .
Yes , the auto industry employs hundreds of thousands of people .
So does China Mart ( Wal Mart ) .
So does the health care industry .
Congress does not have the authority to bail out those industires , either .
How many more private sector industries will be lining up for hot checks from Congress ?
There 's NO money in the U.S. Treasury to loan .
Is anyone out there listening ?
Do n't look to Thanksgiving and Christmas sales to save retailers .
The last I looked at a CNN poll on November 11 , 2008 , a whopping 45 % of nearly 200,000 people said they would not be doing any Christmas shopping this year .
All the lay offs underway and still to come , along with the foreclosures and massive credit card defaults , there 's little money to put into the economy .
This drying up of spending will continue to drain states in unemployment benefits , shrinking tax revenues and medical treatment for those without insurance .
Do n't forget the MILLIONS of illegal aliens sucking off state resources .
The destruction to families all across the country is a true tragedy unfolding .
There is no ' lame duck '
Congress because there will be no " new " Congress sworn in come January to " fix " things .
It 's the same crooks with 17 " new " faces who will join in lockstep with their brethren .
Marxist Obama will bring no change because he 's putting together the same players responsible for the banking collapse as his advisors .
Obama is putting the wolves in the hen house .
That is a fact for those who support Barack Hussein Obama .
You have cut your own throat , you just have n't choked on your own blood yet .
If this sounds rather harsh , the American people are in for the shock of their lives ; the reality will begin to really settle in mid first quarter of next year .
The snow ball effect of job bleeding , no credit left for over extended Americans , continued foreclosures despite all the unconstitutional maneuvers by Congress and even bankrupt states , will slam this country in a few short months .
The links at the bottom are just a small number that tell the story .

The incompetent , Nancy Pelosi and fellow fools are actually contemplating another move that should finally scare the living hell out of the American people :
" Democrats in the U.S. House have been conducting hearings on proposals to confiscate workers ’ personal retirement accounts — including 401 ( k ) s and IRAs — and convert them to accounts managed by the Social Security Administration .
Triggered by the financial crisis the past two months , the hearings reportedly were meant to stem losses incurred by many workers and retirees whose 401 ( k ) and IRA balances have been shrinking rapidly .
" The testimony of Teresa Ghilarducci , professor of economic policy analysis at the New School for Social Research in New York , in hearings Oct. 7 drew the most attention and criticism .
Testifying for the House Committee on Education and Labor , Ghilarducci proposed that the government eliminate tax breaks for 401( k ) and similar retirement accounts , such as IRAs , and confiscate workers ’ retirement plan accounts and convert them to universal Guaranteed Retirement Accounts ( GRAs ) managed by the Social Security Administration . "
Social security is a tax that goes into the general fund of the treasury and is not ear marked for any specific spending purpose .
That is a fact .
To even suggest the $ 1 trillion dollars in retirement funds be transferred over to a government who can't balance a budget and continues to write hot checks for hundreds of billions of dollars every day of the week is the ultimate in lunacy .
Tens of millions of Americans are depending on those retirement accounts to be ready when they retire .
I cannot even put into words what will be the end result if such a dastardly deed is done by Congress .
Pelosi and Obama want a " new " stimulus package .
There is NO money in the treasury .
It is now overdrawn $ 10,622,223,198,682.54 as I write this column .
Our purse , the people 's treasury is over drawn $ 10.6 TRILLION and what these insane lunatics are proposing is writing more hot checks to stave off the inevitable : a major depression .
At the rate Washington is stealing us blind , $ 100 an hour will not be enough to live on and feed your family - if you have a job .
A heavy , progressive taxation is the second plank of the communist manifesto .
All this borrowing to give away to lending institutions and prop up failing industries has to come from some where : YOUR shrinking bank account and take home pay .
The tax man cometh
Congress refuses to stop the unlawful confiscation of your hard earned money by the IRS .
Americans are terrified of this American version of the Nazi Gestapo with very good reason .
However , millions of Americans know that domestic Americans are not subject to the federal income tax .
Congress will not come clean with the truth because they need this forced taxation against we the people to support their monstrous , unconstitutional looting of the treasury .
I have been in the trenches 19 years , full time , nearly seven days a week .
This nation is littered with tax guru 's ripping off desperate people who bought into the oldest or newest income tax scam ( straw man , UCC , redemption , etc ) .
The federal prisons are full of Americans who fell for these bogus arguments .
There are tens of thousands of people employed by organizations who need the income tax to stay a float .
They care nothing for the law or the truth .
The only way we the people will stop the unlawful taking of our labor is the same way prohibition ended : Enough people said enough .
Tommy Cryer is an attorney down in the lovely State of Louisiana .
He is a bull dog fighter who took on the IRS .
Tommy was indicted , went to trial and was acquitted .
We do n't want to see any more Americans go through such an ordeal as Tommy , Joseph Banister and so many others .
One thing that needs to be done is to stop supporting this cottage industry out there who claim they can get you out of the IRS system , when in fact , likely you 'll end up broke and in jail .
It 's time to unify .
Tommy 's organization is growing at a rapid rate .
What YOU need to do is get the facts .
Not the propaganda by U.S. Attorneys who have sold their soul for a paycheck or an IRS employee for the same reason , or the factually challenged vermin who serve in Congress and need to steal your money to continue writing hot checks .
Research takes time .
It does n't come in a shake - n- bake box with instructions .
Tommy has made it very simple for all of us to understand the misapplication of the Internal Revenue Code .
Truth Attack is the one organization in this country where everyone can become a participant .
In order to stop the plunder , you have to dry up the source of revenue being used .
For new readers to my column , take time this weekend to read these two columns of mine :
Why An Income Tax Is n't Necessary to Fund the Federal Government ( also available for free on audio ; listen on your computer or download to your IPod or a CD and listen on the train , in your tractor or in commute traffic ) ; and The Right Argument on Taxation .
Then , go to Tommy 's web site , click here .
This is where you will find what Congress and the media wo n't tell you about the federal income tax and how the IRS , deliberately and with malice , extorts the sweat of your labor with lies .
Do n't let someone else tell you what 's the truth , you do the research and become part of the solution .
To say the economic situation in this country is going to get much worse is the understatement of the century .
What Congress has been doing and what 's coming as a result of their treachery will put millions of Americans into shock .
My mail box is full everyday from Americans scared to death about what 's left in their 401 ( k ) s and what will happen with our currency becoming more worthless by the day .
My mail box is full of stories of people in pain as reality is coming home to roost .
It breaks my heart , but so many of us have tried our best to get the truth out while corporate media and their mouth pieces lie every day in their newspapers and on the tube .
Diversify some of your assets into gold .
Gold is not an ATM machine , it is a long term investment .
There are excellent buys out there if you talk to the right people .
As always , I recommend people I trust and have personally done business with : El Dorado Gold .
Astute investors will always tell you that owning gold is the only real money and a hedge against a monetary collapse and devaluation .
In my last column , I reinforced why it is critical the constitutional militia be reconstituted by the states .
One reader let me know that West Virginia should be included in the states to target because his state stands for freedom and has a lot of real patriots .
One quick follow up : Dr. Edwin Vieira has a good inventory of his Constitutional Militia book if you can't locate it on line ; some people have had a problem finding a copy .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
Online dating site eHarmony will create a service for same - sex matching in a settlement of a 2005 complaint that the company 's failure to offer such a service was discriminatory .
The new same - sex matching service from eHarmony , Compatible Partners , is set to debut by March 31 .
Under terms of the agreement with the New Jersey attorney general 's office , eHarmony Inc. will start the service , called Compatible Partners , by March 31 .
" With the launch of the Compatible Partners site , our policy is to welcome all single individuals who are genuinely seeking long - term relationships , " said Antone Johnson , eHarmony vice president of legal affairs .
The company and its founder , Neil Clark Warren , admit no wrongdoing or liability .
" Even though we believed that the complaint resulted from an unfair characterization of our business , we ultimately decided it was best to settle this case with the attorney general , since litigation outcomes can be unpredictable , " eHarmony attorney Theodore B. Olson said .
Under the settlement 's terms , eHarmony will post photos of successful same - sex couple matches on the company 's Web site and in promotional material .
The company has also agreed to revise statements on its Web sites , handbooks and other publications to indicate that it does not discriminate on the basis of sexual orientation .
The settlement also requires eHarmony to pay plaintiff Eric McKinley $ 5,000 and to pay the New Jersey Division on Civil Rights $ 50,000 to cover administrative expenses .
" I applaud the decision of eHarmony to settle this case and extend its matching services to those seeking same - sex relationships , " said Frank Vespa - Papaleo , director of the New Jersey Division on Civil Rights .
CNN was unable to reach McKinley for comment .
According to the company , on average , more than 236 heterosexual eHarmony members are married every day in the United States .

JAKARTA , Nov. 16 ( UPI ) -- Indonesia was shaken by a powerful earthquake Sunday that the U.S. Geological Survey measured at 7.5 on the Richter scale .
The quake was centered 84 miles northwest of Gorontalo in the Sulawesi region of Indonesia and was followed up by a 5.6 aftershock .
A tsunami warning issued immediately after the quake was later lifted .

Officials said there were no immediate reports of fatalities , Al Jazeera reported .
An Indian Ocean tsunami four years ago caused about 225,000 deaths in Indonesia and 10 other nations .
" This is a much smaller earthquake than the Sumatra earthquake of December 2004 , " Stuart Weinstein of the Pacific Tsunami Warning Center in Hawaii told Al Jazeera .
" It is not going to be anything remotely like that . "
Al Jazeera said the Indonesian state - run Antara news agency reported thousands of people fled their homes and hotel rooms in Gorontalo when the earthquake struck .
At least one person was injured and several buildings collapsed in Gorontalo , which is home to several hundred thousand people .
WASHINGTON  Representative Henry A. Waxman wrested the chairmanship of the powerful House Energy and Commerce Committee from Representative John D. Dingell on Thursday in a coup that is expected to accelerate passage of energy , climate and health legislation backed by President - elect Barack Obama .
Mr. Waxman , 69 , of California , who mounted a quiet but devastatingly effective two - week campaign against his longtime Democratic colleague , won the chairmanship with a 137 - to - 122 vote in the Democratic Caucus .
The vote was secret , but many allies of Speaker Nancy Pelosi backed Mr. Waxman ’s move , and several members said they had voted on the assumption that Ms. Pelosi had tacitly approved .
Democrats also read the signals coming from the president - elect ’s transition office , which this week announced the intention to name Philip Schiliro , a longtime aide to Mr. Waxman , as the White House director of Congressional relations .
The takeover marked the fall of a third long - serving member of Congress in the last two weeks .
Senator Ted Stevens , 85 , Republican of Alaska , lost his re-election bid after a federal fraud conviction .
Senator Robert C. Byrd , 91 , Democrat of West Virginia , stepped aside as chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee last week .
Australian ' Holocaust denier ' arrested at Heathrow claims he is victim of witch - hunt
Holocaust denier Dr Frederick Toben , who was arrested at Heathrow airport
A leading holocaust denier who runs a website insisting the Nazis did not murder millions of Jews will face an extradition hearing tomorrow after being arrested as he flew into Britain .
Dr Fredrick Toben was seized at Heathrow at the request of the German authorities for publishing ' anti-Semitic and / or revisionist ' material between 2000 and 2004 .
Dr Toben - who claims to be facing a ' witch - trial ' - has committed no crime in Britain , where Holocaust denial is not an offence .
But , under the terms of a European Arrest Warrant designed to fast - track extraditions , the Australian citizen can be held in the UK pending possible deportation to Germany - where he faces five years in prison .
Crown Prosecution Service lawyers will appear at City of Westminster Magistrates '
Court tomorrow to make a case on behalf of the German authorities that Dr Toben should be removed .
Appearing in court shortly after he was arrested at Heathrow on Wednesday , Dr Toben , 64 , claimed the ' Germans are out to get me ' , and said he was the victim of ' legal persecution ' .
Dr Toben said : ' It ’s a witch - trial mentality in Germany concerning this matter , which is not the case in England yet .
' You should let me go because this is persecution and you should not demean the court by accepting this application from [ the German court ] .
' The whole procedure is an abuse of process .
I see this matter as a legal ambush .
You would be subjecting me to a legal process you cannot defend yourself against . '
The charges against Dr Toben relate to material published between 2000 and 2004 .
He was arrested in transit from America to Dubai , the court was told .
Tina Whybraw , speaking on behalf of the German authorities , said that he was accused of committing the offences in Australia , Germany and other countries .
Opposing bail , she said : ' It is our assertion that this man would fail to surrender if you were to grant him bail . '
She said that , when police boarded the aircraft , Dr Toben had moved seats ' to avoid detection ' and told officers ' you ca n’t arrest me on British soil ' .
The German - born historian is the founder and director of the Adelaide Institute , a Holocaust denial group .
In a disclaimer on his website , he writes : ' If you wish to begin to doubt the Holocaust - Shoah narrative , you must be prepared for personal sacrifice , must be prepared for marriage and family break - up , loss of career , and go to prison . '
He spent seven months in a German prison in 1999 awaiting trial for charges under Holocaust law , which forbids incitement and ' insulting the memory of the dead ' .
After being found guilty and sentenced to ten months ’ jail , he was released a day later when a supporter posted bail , and fled the country .
Dr Toben also faces jail in Australia for breaching a Federal Court order in 2002 to remove material that it found ' vilified Jewish people ' .
In August , he denied 28 charges of contempt of court brought by the Council of Australian Jewry , which claimed that the website still contained ' virulent anti-Semitic ' material including that there were no homicidal gas chambers at Auschwitz and that the Holocaust was ' the world ’s filthiest blood libel ' .
The European Arrest Warrant , which came into force in 2004 , abolished the principle of ' dual criminality ' that existed under old extradition laws .
This allowed people to be extradited for something that is not a crime here , as long as it is a criminal offence in the country requesting removal .
Jimmy Carl Black , who has died of cancer aged 70 , was drummer and sometimes lead vocalist with Frank Zappa 's Mothers of Invention between 1965 and the group 's bitter break - up in 1970 .
The Mothers created concerts and albums that mixed pop-Dada , 1950s doo - wop , jazz , schmaltz , Stravinsky , Varèse and Webern .
Black was to the fore as Lonesome Cowboy Burt , a highlight of Zappa 's 200 Motels movie ( 1971 ) .
He was the man who introduced himself as " the Indian of the group " on the band 's album , We 're Only in It for the Money ( 1968 ) , and was a central figure in If We'd All Been Living in California , a dialogue on corporate finances on Uncle Meat ( 1969 ) .
Black , who inherited Cheyenne blood from his mother , was born in El Paso , Texas , but grew up in nearby Anthony on the New Mexican border .
He was a soloist in his high school band 's brass section , " but I realised that there was no chance in rock 'n ' roll for a trumpeter , after Elvis Presley appeared at El Paso Coliseum in 1955 .
When I saw the effect he had on those women , I thought , ' Man .
That 's what I want to do ! ' "
Though he could strum a guitar and had had piano lessons , Black bought a drum kit and practised by playing along mostly to black rhythm and blues records .
While serving in the US air force , he joined a country and western trio , Them Three Guys , and , following demobilisation in 1958 , played mainstream pop with the Surfs and then the Keys - with whom Black recorded Stretch Pants ( 1962 ) .
Two years later , he moved to Los Angeles , and formed the Soul Giants , who played LA dance halls .
When the guitarist was drafted into the army , he was replaced by Zappa , who told the band , according to Black , that " if you guys learn my music , I 'll make you rich and famous " .
" He took care of half of that promise , " said Black , " because I 'm damn sure I did n't get rich . "
Renamed the Mothers of Invention , the group followed Zappa 's masterplan to a qualified prosperity via concerts and , later , albums .
" Frank made me aware of modern classical stuff , " said Black , " and very patiently taught me all those complex rhythms and time signatures . "
But Black became increasingly unhappy about Zappa 's control .
He resented the enlistment of a second drummer , and Zappa claiming authorship of tracks such as If We 'd All Been Living in California .
" I never knew he'd taped it at a band meeting , " he complained .
" I was n't credited .
Everything was ' written , arranged and produced by Frank Zappa ' .
Then a week after a successful tour , he called us together and said , ' I 've decided to break up the band .
Your salaries have stopped as from last week . '
It was a big shock .
I had five kids to feed . "
Postscripts to Black 's tenure with Zappa embraced his role in 200 Motels , and an exhumation in 1981 of his character in it , Lonesome Cowboy Burt , for Harder Than Your Husband on Zappa 's You Are What You Is album .
In 1972 Black had success with two albums as leader of Geronimo Black , named after his youngest son .
But by 1974 a Melody Maker interview was conducted in Winebel 's Donuts , where he was , indeed , making doughnuts .
He then moved to Albuquerque , New Mexico , released a solo album , Clearly Classic , which achieved minimal circulation , and joined a Captain Beefheart and his Magic Band world tour .
Black then settled in Austin , Texas , where he established the Gentlemen of Colour , a building - and - decorating business with Arthur Brown , the English star of the 1960s Crazy World of Arthur Brown .
The firm flourished for 10 years - as did an artistic liaison which was to culminate in an album of R&B standards , Brown , Black and Blue ( 1980 ) .
Black was also performing with Eugene Chadbourne - " the free - est form guitar player I 've ever met " - and the Grandmothers , initially , former Mothers band members fronted by the Italian guitarist and Frank Zappa lookalike Sandro Oliva .
Their CDs included a concert recorded in 1998 at London 's Astoria theatre .
Increasing success in Europe led Black to move to Vicenza , Italy with his then wife , a schoolteacher with the US army .
After her death , he moved to Germany , home of his second wife Monika .
In 1995 he began playing with the Muffin Men , the best British interpreters of the work of Zappa and Beefheart .
Black was on the road with the group as recently as 2007 .
Assisted by Roddie Gilliard of the Muffin Men , he was working on an autobiography , For Mother 's Sake .
He is survived by Monika , three sons and two daughters .
• James Carl Inkanish Black , drummer and singer , born February 1 1938 ; died November 1 2008

If you are wondering to yourself , who is Joe the Plumber and why does John McCain seem obsessed with him , join the club .
Both candidates had a good debate performance , the difference is that Obama talked about the economy for the middle class while McCain talked about a guy who wants to buy a business .
The one thing we learned about John McCain tonight is that he can’t think on his feet .
Twice during the debate , McCain raised a question that Obama had just answered .
The first time was when Obama mentioned that offshore drilling was not an answer because America only has 3 % - 4 % of the world ’s oil , but we use 25 % of the world ’s oil .
McCain then made the case for America being able to provide its own supply of oil with offshore drilling .
The second situation occurred when McCain said that Obama ’s health care plan would mean that Joe the Plumber could not afford health care for his employees , but if Joe did n’t provide health care the Obama plan would fine him .
Obama explained that small businesses are exempt from the fine , and said that the fine would be nothing for Joe the Plumber .
McCain seemed surprised that there would be no fine .
It seems that he does n’t know the details of Obama ’s health plan .

McCain had a better night then in the previous two debates , but he still spent too much time talking about tax cuts , and not enough time talking about people who are hurting .
He mentioned them , but he did n’t really say how he would help them .
McCain took the bait on Ayers and ACORN and gave Obama a platform to give a full explanation .
McCain still seemed scattered and did not offer a coherent plan for the future .
I do n’t think that McCain did enough to change the momentum of this race .
The debate was entertaining and a bit nasty , but McCain still did not look as presidential as Obama .
I think Barack Obama had a slight edge tonight .
McCain tried to land some lines , but he could not make anything stick .
McCain made the big mistake of the night while talking about the abortion question .
Neither candidate blew the other one out , but even if you viewed this debate as a tie , the tie benefits Obama .
I do n’t think that McCain was able to score the big blow or reinvent himself tonight .
I think this race stays about where it has been .
Police drug dogs are trained to hunt the smell of drugs Retired sniffer dogs that have spent years on police patrol are now working in the private sector in the US - sniffing out teenagers ' bedrooms .
Parents can rent a dog and handler for $ 200 ( £ 125 ) an hour from Sniff Dogs , a firm operating in New Jersey and Ohio .
The dogs are highly trained and can detect illegal drugs .
The company says the animals can smell marijuana from up to 15 feet away ( 5 m ) and residue on clothing from drugs smoked two days earlier .
The dogs sit when they detect the drugs but they leave the final inspection to the parents .
Discreet service
The company was founded by a mother of two sons , who was surprised to find her oldest son smoking marijuana .
I trust my kids , but you only can trust them so far .
They 're kids , young adults , they 're going to make [ a ] mistake
Pat Winterstein , mother Sniff Dogs claims to offer a " discreet service " that avoids the confrontation that comes from drugs tests because the search can be carried out without the knowledge of their children .
The company cites statistics showing half of American schoolchildren have tried marijuana and that most drug taking takes place when they get home from school .
Pat Winterstein from Washington , New Jersey decided to use the service to search the bedrooms of her three children .
" I trust my kids , but you only can trust them so far .
They 're kids , young adults , they 're going to make ( a ) mistake , " she told ABC news .
Critics claim that the service could be invasive and may break down family trust .

Stanford professor leads Obama immigration team IMMIGRATION : Co-leader of team expected to bring broader perspective

Stanford law Professor Tino Cuéllar was named this week to lead President - elect Barack Obama 's transition working group on immigration , putting him among the many scholars from the Bay Area who are helping shape the next administration .
The team is one of seven policy groups Obama has convened to develop priorities for the first months of his presidency on topics ranging from education to the economy to national security .
The task of overhauling the nation 's immigration system stymied President Bush , who favored an approach combining tougher enforcement with legalization for the country 's estimated 12 million undocumented immigrants and a guest worker program to allow low - skilled foreign workers to enter legally in the future .
Congress twice hammered out " comprehensive " bills on the issue , but Bush lacked the political capital to get the measures passed .
Obama must not only navigate the choppy political waters surrounding an immigration reform bill , but also address many related issues - whether to back an electronic workplace verification system up for reauthorization , how to tackle the unwieldy bureaucracy at the citizenship agency and whether to continue the current immigration enforcement raids .
Through a law school spokeswoman , Cuéllar declined to be interviewed , but lawyers and immigration experts across the country praised him Friday for his intellect and his grasp of both regulatory minutiae and the big picture of American immigration policy .
" He 's brilliant beyond his years , " said John Trasviña , president of the Mexican American Legal Defense and Educational Fund , who met Cuéllar when he was a law student at Yale and encouraged him to go to work in Washington .
At 36 , Cuéllar already has an impressive resume .
Raised on the U.S. - Mexico border in Calexico ( Imperial County ) , he earned his bachelor 's degree at Harvard University before going to Yale Law School and finishing up with a doctorate in political science from Stanford , where he's now a full professor specializing in administrative law .
Along the way , he spent two years at the U.S. Treasury Department under President Bill Clinton , where he worked on fighting money - laundering operations .
Cuéllar has been described as a close adviser to Obama on immigration , and the American Bar Association recently suggested he could be on the short list to head the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services agency .
" He has considerable experience in the federal government , and his academic work has focused on analysis of complex organizations and the way they administer and devise public policy , " said Yale Law School Professor Peter H. Schuck , who was one of Cuéllar 's teachers and counts him as a friend .
" He 'll bring a very keen eye for organizational performance and a very innovative mind . "
Cuéllar will co-lead the immigration policy group with Georgetown University Law Center Dean T. Alexander Aleinikoff , who was second in command at the Immigration and Naturalization Service during the Clinton years .
While Aleinikoff 's background in immigration law is deep , Cuéllar brings a broader perspective , said Muzaffar Chishti , a senior staff member at the nonpartisan Migration Policy Institute in Washington .
The fact that Cuéllar grew up on the border may mean he has strong views about the border fence currently being expanded by the Department of Homeland Security , said Chishti .
" He also has ideas on how issues of trade and economic development ( in other countries ) implicate immigration movements , " he said .
" I think he will be very responsive to the concerns of American workers in the immigration debate . "
The Great White Space War of 2008 continues today as Bill Gates personally joins the last - minute lobbying effort over at the FCC .
Gates and Microsoft Chief Research and Strategy Officer Craig Mundie ( who have partnered on the issue before ) will lobby FCC Commissioner Robert McDowell today on the issue of unlicensed white space devices just weeks after Google cofounder Larry Page also made a rare trip to DC to lobby the FCC in favor of the plan .
The support of Gates and Page for white space devices extends far beyond personal interest ; both of their companies have devoted extensive work to the white space idea , and both have done so for the same reason : they like connectivity .
On a conference call with reporters today , Mundie said that Microsoft supports white space devices for the same reasons it supports WiFi : constant connectivity is good for Zunes , Windows Mobile , laptops running Windows , and the new generation of Windows Live web applications .
Google , likewise , knows that more connectivity means more potential users of its services , especially if that connectivity extends to entirely new users , such as rural residents who currently lack broadband access .
But in the wake of the recent FCC engineering report on various white space prototypes , the broadcasters have been fighting back .
They want an additional 70 - day comment cycle before any further action , while the white space backers ( and FCC Chair Kevin Martin ) are currently hoping for a November 4 vote .
In an FCC filing made Friday afternoon , white space backers derided the call for additional delay .
" After more than four years , multiple notice and comment periods , multiple rounds of lab and field testing , and over 30,000 filings by the public , broadcasters now accused the Commission of a rush to judgment on the white spaces , " said the filing .
" They do so on the thinnest of pretexts — that the Commission somehow has denied them a ' meaningful opportunity ' to review and comment on test data that they watched [ the Office of Engineering Technology ] collect , and about which they have already made no fewer than 16 oral and written presentations on the record . "
Mundie stressed the theme again today , arguing that there is " no justifiable reason " for further FCC delay on the matter .
The main reason given for this claim is the openness of the FCC testing , which Mundie called " the most open testing perceiving that the FCC has ever done . "
The testing schedule was made public and observers were welcome to attend ; in fact , the broadcasters had technical observers at most of the tests in question and they had " every opportunity to review the OET test results in real time as they unfolded . "
Getting Congress involved
As the vote nears , both sides are also dragging Congress into the matter .
John Dingell ( D - MI ) , who heads the House Committee on Energy and Commerce , sent a letter to the FCC last week in which he asked agency officials to respond to questions about accountability and peer review of the test data .
The letter does not appear to be particularly hostile ( it praises the " careful approach to the technical issues " taken by the FCC ) , but it does have questions about how the agency would handle interference concerns once white space devices are in the field , why the FCC declined to pursue a licensed approach to the spectrum in question , and why peer review of the recent testing results was apparently not done .
Senators have also involved themselves in the issue .
Last week , John Kerry ( D - MA ) and Maria Cantwell ( D - WA ) wrote a letter of their own to the FCC in which they urged the agency to " consider the benefit of allowing the unlicensed use of these airwaves " and to move forward with mobile , unlicensed white space devices .
Meanwhile , Google has stepped up its own efforts in what has become an increasingly political campaign .
The company posted a call to action on its Official Google Blog last Thursday , and it also sent an e-mail to supporters , asking them to enlist their friends in the effort .
The Google - backed FreeTheAirwaves.com , which hosts an online petition that will be sent to the FCC , has now attracted 20,000 signers .
Four years gone
The high - powered , election - style campaign ( coincidentally , the FCC vote is scheduled for Election Day in the US ) comes as white space backers badly want to close the deal they have spent four years negotiating .
Mundie made this point plainly today , noting that Microsoft believes in the issue so much , the company actually built prototype white space radios years ago , even though such work wo n't result in a commercial product from the company and even though Microsoft is n't in the radio business .
Microsoft 's busted prototype
Those prototypes famously " failed " in FCC testing in 2007 , though Mundie calls this characterization of those tests " pretty silly . "
The power supplies on early Microsoft prototypes did fail , but Mundie notes that the boxes had been built years before as a proof of concept , and he says that Microsoft engineers did n't think they would need to survive for years .
New , second - generation spectrum - sensing radios from vendors like Motorola were also included in the latest testing .
For broadcasters that oppose the white space effort ( or at least demand significant restrictions on the devices ) , four years of delay , debate , and FCC deliberation matter little ; as the debate rages , the broadcasters can simply continue about their business as usual .
For white space backers like Google and Microsoft , though , used to working quickly and iteratively on fast - moving projects , four years of engineering and lobbying work must feel an eternity ; that sense of Job - style long - suffering certainly came through in Mundie 's comments today .
His argument might best be summed up by the closing lines from last week 's FCC filing in which white space backers pleaded , " After four years of deliberation resulting in one of the most voluminous records in the Commission 's history , the Commission can and should proceed with the vote scheduled for its November meeting .
By doing so , the Commission will enable Coalition members and others to begin the process of creating a new market for innovative products and services that will benefit all Americans . "

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Democrat Barack Obama ’s lead over Republican rival John McCain held steady at 7 points as the race for the White House entered its final four days , according to a Reuters / C- SPAN / Zogby poll released on Friday .
Obama leads McCain by 50 percent to 43 percent among likely voters in the three - day national tracking poll , virtually unchanged from Thursday .
The telephone poll has a margin of error of 2.9 percentage points .
“ Essentially there is no difference in today ’s tracking , ” pollster John Zogby said .
“ Obama is holding firm and McCain is not making any gains . ”
It was the second consecutive day Obama ’s support has hit the 50 percent mark , and the eighth day out of the last 11 .
McCain ’s support has not surpassed 45 percent in more than three weeks of polling .
The Illinois senator held steady among several crucial blocs of swing voters in the Nov. 4 election , leading by 15 points among independents , 9 points among women , 5 points among men and 9 points among Catholics .
Obama led in every age group and among every income group except voters who make more than $ 100,000 .
McCain , a former Navy fighter pilot and Vietnam prisoner of war , trails among voters with a member of the military in their family .
Mccain , an Arizona senator , also was winning only 26 percent of Hispanics , a fast - growing group that gave Republican President George W. Bush more than 40 percent of their vote in 2004 .
“ If you are John McCain you want to see something start changing in this race , and right now it is not , ” Zogby said .
Obama has led McCain in every national opinion poll for weeks , and McCain also trails in many of the key battleground states including Ohio , Florida and Pennsylvania .
McCain was on a bus tour of Ohio and Obama was in Florida , Virginia and Missouri on Thursday , trying to drum up turnout and win over undecided voters in some of about a dozen states that will decide the race .
Independent Ralph Nader received 2 percent in the national survey , and Libertarian Bob Barr was at 1 percent .
About 2 percent of voters remain undecided .
The rolling tracking poll , taken Tuesday through Thursday , surveyed 1,201 likely voters in the presidential election .
In a tracking poll , the most recent day ’s results are added , while the oldest day ’s results are dropped to monitor changing momentum .
The U.S. president is determined by who wins the Electoral College , which has 538 members apportioned by population in each state and the District of Columbia .
Electoral votes are allotted on a winner - take - all basis in all but two states , which divide them by congressional district .
QUEBEC CITY–In just a few hours on Canadian soil , French President Nicolas Sarkozy managed to redefine his country 's once ambiguous take on the question of Quebec 's future within Canada , issuing an unequivocal call for unity .
Standing beside Prime Minister Stephen Harper inside the Governor General 's residence at the historic Citadelle fortress , Sarkozy said the relationship between France and Quebec is more like that of " brothers " while with Canada it is between " friends . "
" I do n't see how proof of fraternal , familial love for Quebec has to feed us proof of defiance toward Canada , " said Sarkozy , who was in Quebec City for a Canada - European Union summit with Harper and to attend the opening day of the Summit of la Francophonie , the international body of French - speaking nations .
The French president went further , in his blunt , animated style , invoking the economic crisis that has gripped the world .
" Frankly , " Sarkozy ventured , " if there 's someone who would tell me that the world today needs another division , then we do n't have the same read of the world . "
He said France is a country that joins , instead of divides .
" I know perfectly well that in Quebec there are francophones who are part of our family .
Francophones in my family do n't ask me not to consider Canada ... as a friend . "
Harper , clearly pleased with Sarkozy 's words , said that Canadian anglophones also " understand the special nature " of the Franco - Quebec relationship and " respect " it .
Harper said France and Canada remain allies and friends .
" It 's hard to imagine why we would want to have tension between France and Canada , when we have huge challenges in the world to solve together , " the prime minister said .
Sarkozy was expected to redefine the relationship , which sovereignists in Quebec have counted on for the last 30 years to be neutral , if not ambiguous .
It had been a doctrine of " non-interference , non- indifference " after former president Charles de Gaulle uttered his now infamous declaration in 1967 : " Vive le Québec libre ! "
( Long live a free Quebec . )
French politicians have over the years irritated Canada with direct exchanges and missions to Quebec , sometimes bypassing international protocol by ignoring Ottawa .
In a speech yesterday to the province 's National Assembly , a first for a French president , Sarkozy wowed the politicians and guests with soaring praise for Quebec .
He praised how quickly Quebec had emerged from its conservative religious past , its businesses , technologies , artists , and the " music " of Quebecers ' spoken French .
" The French people and the Québécois are like two brothers , separated by distance but reunited today by a common intent to develop their original vision of the world , in French , in a world where the real wealth is diversity , " he said .
He paraphrased de Gaulle : " Long live the friendship between Canada and France !
Long live the brotherhood between the French people and the Quebec people . "
Sovereignist leaders were n't commenting on Sarkozy 's plea for unity , but Parti Québécois Leader Pauline Marois said after the speech she did not interpret his speech as any change in protocol .
Bloc Québécois Leader Gilles Duceppe gave a practical assessment .
" When we speak of brotherhood , that we are brothers , that we have friendly relations with Canada , that 's fine with me , " Duceppe said .
" Now , we do n't choose for France ( and ) France does n't choose for us . "
Earlier this year Sarkozy surprised sovereignists with his remarks during a ceremony to mark the end of World War II .
Sarkozy gave an emotional speech thanking Canadians , wherever they came from , for their sacrifice in liberating France .
He said the future of France and Canada is of " two countries . "
After yesterday 's speech , Sarkozy and Quebec Premier Jean Charest signed a labour mobility agreement , which will make it much easier for certain professional or vocational qualifications to be recognized in each others ' jurisdiction .
It 's an unprecedented accord between a province and a foreign country , and reflects both Quebec 's and Charest 's desire to enhance Quebec 's own foreign relations .
Quebec government officials acknowledged the agreement makes it easier for workers from France to work in Quebec than it will be for Canadians from other provinces .
As of today , George W Bush has exactly 77 days left to put his CV in order , a difficult task complicated by the fact that whatever he 's done as president , he has n't done much of it lately .
There are n't many positions out there suited to a former world leader and professional lame duck , but a few high - profile vacancies have presented themselves in recent weeks , and more are bound to arise as the year draws to a close .
There must be some job the man can do competently .
He still has so much to give .
The new Doctor Who
Ever since David Tennant announced he was handing in his sonic screwdriver , speculation over his potential replacement has been rife .
But not one person - correct me if I 'm wrong - has so far suggested Bush for the role .
The surprise when Tennant morphed into the former president on Christmas Day would therefore be enormous , and huge ratings for the first two episodes would be guaranteed .
It 's hard to see him lasting long , but perhaps he 'll turn his inability to say " reverse the polarity of the neutron flow " into a charming character flaw .
Leader , North Korea
It 's just possible that this position will open up soon - if it has n't already .
Bush would no doubt enjoy the constant sabre - rattling that comes with being a key player in the axis of evil ( though he should bear in mind they do n't call it that ) , but he might have trouble adjusting to the unstinting adulation .
Presenter , Friday Night with Dubya
This would only be a temporary assignment while Jonathan Ross serves out his exile , but even a one - time leader of the free world would find the salary agreeable .
He 'd probably do it for half .
And Bush , for all his faults , does have a certain folksy plausibility when he 's one - on - one with people , which ought to come in handy when he 's interviewing Hollywood stars who hate him .
He 'd have to start right away , but he's not exactly busy at the moment , and Ross managed to present the show as a sideline to his many other projects for years .
Tour guide , presidential library
Yes , naming a library after George W Bush is like naming an outpatient clinic after Harold Shipman , but it 's a tradition in America to establish commemorative repositories in the home state of every former commander - in - chief , regardless of reading age or standing in the worst - presidents - of - all - time table .
Since this particular library is liable to be little more than a collection of cowboy hats and signed baseballs , Bush should have no trouble showing people around .
It would be highly irregular for him to walk up to the front desk and say , " Hello , my name is George Bush , this is my library , and I would like an application form , " but what are they gonna do ?
Say no ?
Manager , Watford FC
Adrian Boothroyd has just been sacked after taking his club from probable relegation from the Championship all the way to the Premiership and back to probable relegation from the Championship in just 176 games .
In his job interview Bush could point to eerie parallels with his own administration , except without the early success .
He probably does n't know much about football , but , frankly , how much does he have to know ?
Star , W : the Musical
This seemingly insane scenario is predicated on the twin suppositions that the Oliver Stone biopic will translate readily to the stage and that Bush can sing .
But lots of unlikely films have been turned into musicals , and if Bush turns out to be tone deaf he can always rap his way through like Rex Harrison did in My Fair Lady .
Still , it would be weird .
A bit like getting Jerry Springer to star in Jerry Springer : The Opera .
Actually , that is n't such a bad idea either .
Or maybe Bush could play Springer .
Think of the protests .
Host , MTV Awards
There are two positions to be filled here - Russell Brand already looks doubtful for next year , and Lindsay Lohan has just been fired from hosting the MTV World Music Awards , a slightly less glamorous appointment which does n't require much more than the ability to read from an autocue in a hesitant and uncomprehending manner .
He 's a shoo -in .
Interior minister , Iran
In the old days , the only qualification for the post was a fake degree from a made - up British institution - the previous incumbent , Ali Kordan , possessed a forged certificate for an honorary degree from " London Oxford University " - but Bush has two real degrees , a BA from Yale and an MBA from Harvard Business School ( I know - he wears it lightly , does n't he ? ) .
In fact this may be the first time Bush has gone for a job for which he is supremely overqualified , but he still has some hearts and minds to win in Tehran .
Paris Hilton 's new best friend
This has never been considered a job for life , or even long - term employment , but Paris is currently in the market for someone who is " hot , who can keep up with me , and most of all , who is real , and wo n't be a backstabber " .
She 's also looking in London , unfortunately .
But if he can do the accent well enough to fool Paris Hilton ( and how hard will that be , do you think ? ) , he might also be able to convince her that he is both hot and real .
And he's the former president of the United States of America , so it 's not as if she 'll recognise him .
Presenter , Top Gear
Bush is one of nature 's petrol - heads , and the sort of easy - going , rightwing regular guy voters used to say they 'd like to have a beer with .
A spot on the current presenting team could be about to open up , depending on how many letters the BBC receives over the course of the next week that begin " Dear Sirs : I have been a lorry driver for the last 18 years and in that time I have never murdered a single prostitute . "
Bush should send in an audition tape ( not the State of the Union address ) just in case .
Sarah Palin 's running mate , 2012
A Palin-Bush partnership could provide the Republicans with the ultimate " maverick - anti- maverick " ticket four years from now .
The 22nd amendment constitution prevents a two - term president from seeking the office again , but does the US constitution say anything about him becoming vice president and then acceding to the office through the sudden incapacitation of a phenomenally unpopular president ?
Actually it does - the 12th amendment states that " no person constitutionally ineligible to the office of President shall be eligible to that of Vice - President of the United States " - but does Sarah Palin know that ?
No .
Is she going to read about it in the Guardian ?
No .
Biographer , George Bush Sr
A thorough trashing of his father 's legacy could one day see Dubya become widely regarded as only the second - worst president of the US , but he 'll need someone to check his spelling .
BARACK Obama swept to victory last night as millions of Americans lapped up all that bullshit about change .
The Illinois senator made history as the first black American to become President and the 44th man to win the office with a lot of vague platitudes and an army of creepy spin doctors .
He told a crowd of 250,000 supporters in his home city of Chicago : “ Remember , change is something that happens in the middle of the night when we ’re all fast asleep and very often the next morning no - one can tell that anything has actually changed .
“ I promised you change you can believe in , I did not promise you change you can actually see . ”
He added : “ You believe in Jesus do n’t you ?
Right , but have you ever seen Jesus ?
Exactly .
Just making sure we ’re all on the same page . ”
Mr Obama said he would bring about change by working closely with the vast and terrifying multi-national corporations that had funded his campaign and pledged to end the war in Iraq in order to create a much bigger war in Afghanistan .
“ But instead of some middle - aged white guy doing it , it ’ll be me and I ’m half - Kenyan .
D’you see ? ”
Bill McKay , a college student from Denver , said : “ I ca n’t believe I now live in a country where an African American can be elected to the presidency after spending just $ 600 million on advertising . ”
He added : “ Give me a hug ! ”
Meanwhile , in the UK , thousands of people talked about staying up all night to watch the drama unfold , but then did n’t .
Martin Bishop , from Oxford , said : “ I was going to follow the coverage and have the significance of every result explained to me by Lord Dimbleby but then , at the last minute , I decided to go to bed because I do n’t care . ”
Denys Hatton , from Guildford , added : “ If your life is such that you ’re placing all your hopes in a politician , then may I humbly suggest you get yourself a crate of superlager and a cardboard box and stop wasting everyone ’s time . ”
DIGG THIS
Just about the only good thing to come out of the housing bubble is that many financial analysts are coming to see the virtue of the Austrian theory of the business cycle .
Specifically , though Greenspan did his best to blame deregulation and foreigners who saved too much , many people now think that the Maestro ’s ultra - low interest rates in the wake of the dot - com crash may very well have sowed the seeds for our current crisis .
Ironically , at the very moment of the free - market economists ’ intellectual victory , some in our camp want to take away the champagne .
Specifically , Tyler Cowen has repeatedly argued on his very popular blog that it was not the Fed but rather an increase in foreigners ’ savings and appetite for risk , that caused the boom .
And in a recent Cato paper , David Henderson and Jeffrey Rogers Hummel defend Greenspan ’s record , going so far as to say that " Alan Greenspan stands out as the most competent — and arguably the only competent — helmsman of United States monetary policy since the creation of the Federal Reserve System . "
Let me warn the reader that I am going to have nothing nice to say about this defense of Greenspan ; I think his policies caused or at least made possible the housing boom .
As I walk through the specifics of the Henderson and Hummel ( H&H ) defense , I conclude many of their statements are either misleading or outright falsehoods .
Because my critique will be so harsh , I want to stress that I actually know H&H personally , and acknowledge that they are both intelligent and very courageous advocates of economic liberty .
So all I can say regarding this particular Cato paper is that either they or I am suffering from a bout of temporary insanity — and the little green elf who hovers over my laptop assures me I ’m not the one who ’s crazy .
Many Austrians Were On to Greenspan For Years
Since their objective is to defend Greenspan ’s overall record , it is appropriate that H&H remind everyone that " two years ago , on leaving office , Greenspan was widely heralded as a financial wizard whose wise , discretionary macromanagement had brought an unprecedented two decades of low inflation , high prosperity , and infrequent and mild recessions . "
But then the fickle public turned on poor Alan — and all because of a pesky little financial crisis not seen since the Great Depression .
Now all of a sudden the Maestro is the bad guy !
H&H explain : " Recently converted critics are now charging Greenspan with having carried on an excessively expansionary monetary policy , particularly following the recession of 2001 and possibly during the dot - com boom that preceded it " ( emphasis added ) .

The two candidates could n’t differ more on any hot - button issue you toss in front of them .
Their positions on supporting American college students is also quite the contrast , as are their individual college experiences .
Obama attended Columbia and Harvard , and only recently paid off his student loan debt ; McCain attended the U.S. Naval Academy , which was free .
Amongst a crashing economy where college tuition support is harder to come by , and college tuition is skyrocketing faster than inflation , one candidate is in favor of the government lending support to college students , while the other thinks that you should cram in a night job between an 18 - hour class schedule - plus labs and study groups .
While they agree that college tuition is n’t affordable to most Americans and that the process to attain that aid is convuluted - the similarities part there .
“ McCain ’s message when it comes to increased tuition is , ‘ You ’re on your own , ’ ” says Michael Dannenberg , senior fellow with the New America Foundation and not a member of Obama ’s campaign .
“ Obama ’s message to families is , ‘ We ’ll give you more financial aid to help you with college costs , but your kids are going to have to help others . ' ”
Obama ’s plan is more detailed than McCains , albeit with a larger price tag .
His position is that it ’s the government ’s job to support college students persuing a degree .
He ’s not giving it away - in exchange for 100 hours of community service each year , the government will offer students a $ 4,000 tax break .
McCain has put focus on making the financial aid system more efficient , but does not intend to increase its breadth .
He wants parents to be more informed and says more money can be available if we eliminate wasteful spending .
Regarding Pell Grants , Obama has made a promise to fund them in a way that keeps up with the demands of tuition increases ( which the government is currently not able to do ) .
McCain ’s camp says they are n’t making any direct promises , but if a need arises and there ’s room in the budget , they ’ll consider increasing funds .
No matter which candidate is in office , to keep up , $ 6 billion will be needed next year to support demand .
McCain and Obama do not agree on how the $ 60 billion in student loan money from the government should be managed and distributed either .
Obama would like to see the current system of direct government aid and lending through subsidized banks eliminated , and instead have all student loans paid directly by the government .
McCain prefers the current system and those who support this idea say the government would have trouble managing it solely on its own .
Obama would also like to see the FAFSA eliminated ; and just this week Education Secretary Margaret Spellings presented a new form that eliminated 74 of the 100 questions on the current form .
Your vote does count – and if you want either of these or future candidates to hear your needs , casting a vote is one way to ensure you ’re heard .

When will " the literary establishment " start taking science fiction more seriously ?
Everybody from Michael Chabon to David Hartwell wants to know .
But would most readers really be happy if science fiction actually became more literary ?
Here 's our list of things that might change about science fiction if it took on more literary pretensions .
I actually find myself disagreeing with Michael Chabon , somewhat , when he claims there 's no real difference between literary and genre fiction .
I 've spent enough time in the literary scene ( well , a literary scene ) to get a sense that there is such a thing as literary writing .
It has its own set of clichés , its own expectations , and its own chosen subject matter .
You do n't pick up the New Yorker , much less a small lit journal whose name ends in " Review , " expecting to see the same kind of thing you 'd see in Asimov's .
You just do n't .
At the same time , there 's no one " literary establishment , " with a single viewpoint .
A couple of years ago , the New York Times Book Review polled 125 critics and authors to decide the best novels of the past 25 years .
The winner , Toni Morrison 's Beloved , got only 15 votes .
Most other selections got only a handful of votes , meaning that nobody could agree on the best works .
Not only that , but the list of winning books absolutely screams " lowest common denominator , " with an over - representation of boring hacks like John Updike .
( My hero Donald Hall spends a whole chapter in his seminal writing handbook Writing Well explaining , pitilessly and irrefutably , why John Updike really is a terrible writer , sentence by sentence . )
And that 's the thing : the most literary writing from the " literary world " never really attains much prominence outside of a cloistered scene that talks amongst itself .
There are tons of writers who are literary superstars in some context , but they 'll never get profiled in Entertainment Weekly or reviewed in the NYTBR , any more than any paperback scifi writer will .
In fact , the literary world is a lot like science fiction in that respect .
There are literary stars who never break out of the lit ghetto , and then there are some who cross over and become " mainstream . "
There are people who the Quinnipiac Review will fall over itself to publish , whom you 'll never in a million years hear of .
Which is the point , sort of — maybe at some point in the past the term " literary " referred to works , from whatever genre , that had stood the test of time and gained classic stauts .
But nowadays " literary " refers to a particular type of writing .
It 's a genre in its own right , just like science fiction .
" Literary " certainly does n't mean " good . "
It 's a description for one way in which writing can be good .
But something can be literary and not particularly good , and writing can be good without being particularly literary .

Let 's take a concrete example : I recently reviewed David Louis Edelman 's Multireal , and a while before that I reviewed The Stone Gods by former literary darling Jeanette Winterson .
There is no doubt in my mind that Edelman 's novel is a much better book than The Stone Gods , which is a severely flawed work .
But The Stone Gods is a thousand times more literary than Multireal .
Literary qualities that The Stone Gods possesses include a masterful , poetic prose style ; a clever experimentation with narrative form ; a heavy layer of irony over the main characters ' inner lives ; a story that jumps around in time and repeats the same motifs and characters across different settings .
Multireal , by contrast , tells a complicated story in a fairly straightforward way .
The earlier novel , Infoquake , has one big flashback that takes up a third of the book , and there are some dream sequences here and there .
But it 's not that arty .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
Certainly there are some SF writers writing today who are " literary . "
Kim Stanley Robinson comes to mind , as does Geoff Ryman .
Sarah Hall 's Carhullan Army / Daughters Of The North , which just won the Tiptree Award , is extremely literary .
Many lit snobs now talk about Samuel R. Delany with as much rapture as they reserve for Raymond Carver or Alice Munroe .
What would you get if science fiction novels and stories were more " literary " ?
It would n't necessarily make them better , or even help them gain respectability .
But here 's a random , and possibly wrong - headed , selection of what you might get if science fiction went more " lit . " : 1 ) More ambiguity .
A friend of mine used to joke that the New Yorker 's short stories always had to end with a " clarifying moment of ambiguity . "
We 're not sure what 's just happened , and nothing has actually been resolved , but we feel somehow better , or worse , about the whole business now that it 's over .
Oh , and here 's a teacup .
Is n't it shiny ?
So forget having everything explained — in fact , the less we understand about what just happened , the better .
2 ) Fancier word - play .
Most science fiction stories and novels use language as a tool to get the story across .
They 're usually written serviceably , but not sparklingly .
There are usually way too many adverbs , too many passive sentences , and too much use of the verb " to be . "
In literary writing , by contrast , there 's an obsession with prose style .
Every sentence must dapple , like sunlight through a babboon 's toes in the jungle .
A couple years ago , I got on the mailing list for a few of the biggest literary publishers and found myself receiving a couple dozen literary books a month .
I read as many of them as I could , and the writing was often quite lovely , even when the stories left no other impression on my mind .
MFA programs are exploding with people who have been drilled to create prose bonsai .
3 ) Paragraphs that start with numbers .
I have no idea where this fad came from — maybe poetry ? — but I still see it a lot , especially in short fiction .
It used to be lists , or fake memos , but I think those are out now .
But numbers are still around .
4 ) Heroes who are less heroic .
Look at it this way :
Why is Hamlet the most written about of Shakespeare 's plays ?
It 's not because it 's good .
Hamlet is actually a pretty weak play , lacking the cleverness of As You Like It or the heaviness of the Scottish play .
Several other Shakespeare plays , including The Tempest , have nicer writing .
Actors like Hamlet because the lead role gives them a chance to have fun grandstanding and Burbageing .
But critics love Hamlet because the main character is such a poor hero .
He could n't lace his boots without agonizing about it for hours , and he 's horrified by his own mortality in precisely the way that a hero is n't supposed to be .
So goodbye escapist science fiction heroes , hello angsty wanderers !
Advertisement
5 ) Tell us more about the teacup .
It 's chipped on one side , but somehow the friction from all those fingernails holding it steady has worn it down .
So the chipped area feels almost polished , as if the cup - maker chipped it herself , and then glazed it .
There 's a stain on its base that no amount of scrubbing with the wiry brush is ever equal to removing .
It has a pattern of flowers and baby 's breath , which you have n't noticed in years .
6 ) A fetishization of a certain kind of person .
People joke about the literary story revolving around suburban malaise , but it 's sort of true nonetheless .
During my year of reading piles of literary books , I read tons of near - identical stories of growing up with a nanny , or being a soccer mom , or being a business dad .
For some reason , a lot of literary novels start with a funeral , forcing a successful thirtysomething or fortysomething person to return to his / her family and uncover the buried secrets of his / her childhood .
( Think Sweet Home Alabama , but not quite as cute . )
In science fiction terms , this would mean more stories about middle managers , shuttling around below decks on the starcruiser and wondering if this is all there is to life .
7 ) Why do we feel bad ?
A lot of the most interesting literary fiction that I 've read lately has a kind of malaise running underneath it .
Angsty , or maybe angry .
I 'm thinking Gary Amdahl type stuff .
Stories about people who feel bad or pissed off for reasons they can't articulate , and which we understand even less well than they do .
Science fiction has come a long way since the days when it had to feature " happy , competent characters " with no emotional problems .
But it 's still the literature of problem - solving , not anhedonia .
So it 's a " be careful what you wish for " type of thing .
As I said earlier , some science fiction is genuinely literary , as much as anything in The New Yorker ever is , but I would n't want to see all science fiction writers making that their life 's goal .
I love literary fiction , for mostly different reasons than I love science fiction .
There are truths you can only tell by being playful with words , or by delving into intentional murkiness .
The best literary fiction is both clever and heart - throttling , making you confront the " boredom , the horror and the glory " of life by forcing you to see more clearly , or more murkily , than you 're accustomed to seeing .
The best science fiction , by contrast , is about exploring brilliant ideas , thought experiments , possible futures or just escapist fun .
And there 's nothing wrong with that .
This is a non-comprehensive list of papers and tools dealing with automated unpacking .
Please let me know if I ’ve missed another technique or if I misunderstood any of the techniques below .
Ring0 / Ring3 components , using manual unpacking and heuristics
OllyBonE :
OllyBonE ( Break on Execution ) uses a Windows driver to prevent memory pages from being executed , and an OllyDbg plugin communicating with the driver .
As such it is not an automatic unpacker and requires manual tagging of the pages in which the unpacked code is expected to be found .
Technology used : Windows driver to prevent memory page execution , debugger plugin
Handles unknown packers : no .
Drawbacks : requires a priori knowledge of the memory location of the unpacked code , vulnerable to anti-debugging techniques , modification of the integrity of the host operating system due to the driver .
Code Available : yes , http://www.joestewart.org/ollybone/.
Original Site
( Updated ) Dream of Every Reverser / Generic Unpacker :
It is a Windows driver used to hook ring 3 memory accesses .
It is used in a project called Generic Unpacker by the same author to find the original entrypoint .
The tool then tries to find all import references , dumps the file and fixes the imports .
It is reported to work against UPX , FSG and AsPack , but not against more complex packers .
Technology used : Windows driver to hook userland memory access
Handles unknown packers : no .
Drawbacks : requires a priori knowledge of the memory location of the unpacked code , modification of the integrity of the host operating system due to the driver .
Code Available : yes , http://deroko.phearless.org/GenericUnpacker.rar.
Original Site
( updated ) RL !
Depacker
No description for this one , however it looks similar to Dream of Every Reverser / Generic Unpacker .
Code Available : yes , http://ap0x.jezgra.net/RL!dePacker.rar.
Original Site
( updated ) QuickUnpack
Again , no real description , but it looks similar to RL !
Depacker and DOER / Generic Unpacker .
It is a scriptable engine using a debugging API .
It is reported to work against 60 + simple packers .
Code Available : yes , http://www.team-x.ru/guru-exe/?path=Tools/Unpackers/QuickUnpack/
Original Site ( in Russian )
Universal PE Unpacker :
This is an IDA Pro plugin , using the IDA Pro Debugger interface .
It waits for the packer to call GetProcAddress and then activates single - stepping mode until EIP is in a predefined range ( an estimate for the OEP ) .
It only works well against UPX , Morphine , Aspack , FSG and MEW ( according to the authors of Renovo ) .
Technology used : Debugging and heuristics .
Handles unknown packers : no , needs an approximation of the OEP and assumes that the unpacker will call GetProcAddress before calling the original code .
Drawbacks : not fully automatic , very vulnerable to debugger detection , does not necessarily work against all packers or self - modifying code .
Code Available : yes , since IDA Pro 4.9
Original Site
Instruction - level analysis , comparison between written addresses and executed addresses
Renovo :
Built on TEMU ( BitBlaze ) , it uses full system emulation to record memory writes ( and mark those memory locations as dirty ) .
Each time a new basic block is executed , if it contains a dirty memory location a hidden layer has been found .
Cost : 8 times slower than normal execution .
It seems to unpack everything correctly except Armadillon and Obsidium ( due to incorrect system emulation ? ) .
It seems to only obtain partial results against Themida with the VM option on .
Technology used : Full system emulation .
Handles unknown packers : yes .
Drawbacks : order of magnitude slowdown , detection of the emulation stage
Code Available : I could n’t find it .
Original Site , Local Copy
Azure :
Paul Royal ’s solution , named after BluePill because it is based on KVM , a Linux - based hypervisor .
It uses Intel ’s VT extension to trace the target process ( at the instruction - level ) , by setting the trap flag and intercepting the resulting exception .
The memory writes are then recorded and compared to the address of the current instruction .
According to the paper , it handles every packer correctly ( including Armadillo , Obsidium and Themida VM ) .
Technology used : Hardware assisted virtualization and virtual machine introspection .
Handles unknown packers : yes .
Drawbacks : detection of the hypervisor .
Slowdown ?
Code Available : yes , http://blackhat.com/presentations/bh-usa-08/Royal/Royal_Extras.zip.
Original Site , Local Copy
Saffron :
Developed by Danny Quist and Valsmith , a first version uses Intel PIN to dynamically instrument the analyzed code .
It actually inserts instructions in the code flow , allowing lightweight fine - grained control ( no need for emulation or virtualization ) , but it modifies the integrity of the packer .
A second version modifies the page fault handler of Windows and traps when a written memory page is executed .
It has mixed results with Molebox , Themida , Obsidium , and does n’t handle Armadillo correctly ( according to Paul Royal ) .
Technology used : Dynamic instrumentation , Pagefault handling ( with a kernel component in the host operating system ) .
Handles unknown packers : yes .
Drawbacks : modifies the integrity of the code ( with DI ) and of the host operating system .
It must not work in a virtual machine .
The dynamic instrumentation is very slow .
The memory monitoring of the pagefault handler is coarse - grained ( pages are aligned on a 4 k boundary ) , and therefore some memory access can go unnoticed .
Code Available : dynamic instrumentation available , what about the driver ?
Original Site , Local Copy
( updated ) OmniUnpack :
Uses a technique similar to the second version of Saffron : a Windows driver to enforce a W^X policy on memory pages .
Technology used : Pagefault handling and system call tracing ( with a kernel component in the host operating system )
Handles unknown packers : yes .
Drawbacks : modifies the integrity of the host operating system .
It must not work in a virtual machine .
The memory monitoring of the pagefault handler is coarse - grained , leading to spurious unpacking stages .
Code Available : ?

Pandora ’s Bochs :
Developed by Lutz Böhne , it is based on Bochs which is used to monitor memory writes and compare them with branch targets .
Interestingly , the assumptions about the program are stated explicitly ( which is a GOOD thing ) : the unpacking does not involve multiple processes , it does not happen in kernel mode , the unpacked code is reached through a branch instruction ( not a fall - through edge ) , etc …
Another interesting point in this approach is that it uses no component in the guest OS ( as opposed to Renovo for example ) , all the information is retrieved from outside the matrix ( as with Azure ) .
Technology used : Full system emulation based on Bochs .
Handles unknown packers : yes .
Drawbacks :
As stated in the paper the limitations are speed , compatibility ( not all packed samples seemed to run under Bochs ) , detection of OEP and reconstruction of imports sometimes failed .

Other techniques ( comparison with static disassembly or disk image )
Secure and Avanced Unpacking by Sebastien Josse :
The idea developed by Sebastien Josse is to use full system emulation ( based on QEMU ? ) and to compare the basic blocks that are going to be executed by the virtual CPU with the equivalent address in the file image of the executable .
If the memory and the disk version differ , it means that the code has been generated on the fly and therefore a hidden layer has been found .
Josse then proposes techniques to rebuild a fully functional executable based on the memory dump .
This technique seems to work well ( but sometimes requires human intervention ) against several packers , including Armadillo , ASProtect , PEtite , UPX , yC …
Technology used : Full system emulation , comparison between memory images and disk images .
Handles unknown packers : yes , manual intervention might be required in some cases .
Drawbacks : slowdown due to the full system emulation , full reconstruction of the unpacked program is not always possible .

PolyUnpack :
The idea behind PolyUnpack is to address the fundamental nature of unpacking , which is runtime code generation .
To identifiy code that has been generated at runtime , PolyUnpack uses a conceptually elegant technique : it first statically analyses the program to build a map of statically accessible code , and then traces the execution of the program .
The dynamically intercepted instructions are compared with the static disassembly , if they do not appear in the static disassembly then they have been generated at runtime .
Technology used : comparison between static disassembly and dynamic tracing .
The dynamic trace is extracted with single - step debugging APIs .
Handles unknown packers : yes .
Drawbacks : vulnerable to debugger detection .
Note that this is a limitation of the implementation , not of the concept .

AN AFGHAN asylum seeker rejected by Australia under the Howard government was tortured and beheaded by kidnappers less than four weeks ago in a province south of Kabul .
The man , Mohammed Hussain , was thrown down a well by gunmen , believed to be the Taliban .
Then in front of onlookers including members of his family , the killers threw a hand grenade down the well and he was decapitated .
Accounts of the killing were given to Phil Glendenning , director of the Edmund Rice Centre , this week .
He told the Herald he has verified the events with four different sources in Afghanistan .
Oregon Woman Loses $ 400,000 to Nigerian E-Mail Scam

SWEET HOME , Ore . —
Janella Spears of Sweet Home says she simply became curious when she received an e-mail promising her $ 20.5 million if she would only help out a long - lost relative identified as J.B. Spears with a little money up front .
Spears told KATU - TV about the scammers ' ability to identify her relative by name was persuasive .
" That 's what got me to believe it , " She said .
" So , why would n't you send over $ 100 ? "
• Click here to visit FOXNews.com 's Cybersecurity Center .
Spears , who is a nursing administrator and CPR teacher , said she mortgaged the house and took a lien out on the family car , and ran through her husband 's retirement account .
" The retirement he was dreaming of — cruising and going around and seeing America — is pretty much gone for him right now , " she said .
She estimates it will take two years to clear the debt that accumulated in the more than two years she spent sending money to con artists .
Her family and bank officials told her it was all a scam , she said , and begged her to stop , but she persisted because she became obsessed with getting paid .
The scheme is often called the " Nigerian scam " and it 's familiar to many people with e-mail accounts .
It still exists and it still works .
Spears first sent $ 100 through an untraceable wire service as directed by the scammers .
Then , more multimillion dollar promises followed so long as she sent more money .
The scammers sent Spears official - looking documents and certificates from the Bank of Nigeria and the United Nations .
President Bush and FBI Director Robert Mueller were also involved , the e-mails said , and needed her help .
They sent official - looking documents and certificates from the Bank of Nigeria and even from the United Nations , saying her payment was " guaranteed . "
But it was n't and now Spears is paying the price for her costly lesson .
" The hope is [ other people ] are not going to fall as hard as I fell , " Spears said .

Ben Macintyre introduces us to the term ‘ post - turtle ’ :
A 75 - year - old Texas rancher recently explained this term to a country doctor .
The conversation turned to the US election , and Sarah Palin ’s vice - presidential candidacy , and the old rancher observed : “ Well , ya know , Palin is a post - turtle . ”
The bemused doctor asked what a post - turtle was , and the old man replied : “ When you ’re driving down a country road and you come across a fence post with a turtle balanced on top , that ’s a post - turtle . ”
The rancher continued : “ You know she did n’t get up there by herself , she does n’t belong up there , she does n’t know what to do while she is up there , and you just wonder what kind of dumb ass put her up there to begin with . ”
I love the term , and I really should n’t quibble , but it falls short in one sense — this turtle wanted to be on that fence post .
Indeed , when it was asked to get up there , it did not blink — and now it wants to live up on the tallest fence post of all , in case Putin rears his head and all .
No real turtle would have such self - delusion .
And really , turtles are sweet little things , and protecting them from such cruel analogies is yet another good reason to not vote for Sarah Palin .
( Link via email from Vikram Chandrashekar .
More Palin : 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 . )
Update ( October 11 ) : Sanjeev emails to say that the analogy has been used earlier while talking about Barack Obama , George W Bush and Bill Clinton .
Maybe it applies to all politicians .
After all , as Don Boudreaux once asked , who ’s qualified to run a country ?
It ’s the ultimate argument , the final bastion against withdrawal , and over these last years , the Bush administration has made sure it would have plenty of heft .
Ironically , its strength lies in the fact that it has nothing to do with the vicissitudes of Iraqi politics , the relative power of Shiites or Sunnis , the influence of Iran , or even the riptides of war .
It really does n’t matter what Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki or oppositional cleric Muqtada al - Sadr think about it .
In fact , it ’s an argument that has nothing to do with Iraq and everything to do with us , with the American way of war ( and life ) , which makes it almost unassailable .
And this week Chairman of the Joint Chiefs Mike Mullen  the man President - elect Obama plans to call into the Oval Office as soon as he arrives  wheeled it into place and launched it like a missile aimed at the heart of Obama ’s 16 - month withdrawal plan for US combat troops in Iraq .
It may not sound like much , but believe me , it is .
The Chairman simply said , “ We have 150,000 troops in Iraq right now .
We have lots of bases .
We have an awful lot of equipment that ’s there .
And so we would have to look at all of that tied to , obviously , the conditions that are there , literally the security conditions ?
Clearly , we ’d want to be able to do it safely . ”
Getting it all out safely , he estimated , would take at least “ two to three years . ”
For those who needed further clarification , the Wall Street Journal ’s Yochi J. Dreazen spelled it out : “ In recent interviews , two high - ranking officers stated flatly that it would be logistically impossible to dismantle dozens of large US bases there and withdraw the 150,000 troops now in Iraq so quickly .
The officers said it would take close to three years for a full withdrawal and could take longer if the fighting resumed as American forces left the country . ”
As for the Obama plan , if the military top brass have anything to say about it , sayonara .
It ’s “ physically impossible , ” says “ a top officer involved in briefing the President - elect on US operations in Iraq , ” according to Time Magazine .
The Washington Post reports that , should Obama continue to push for his two brigades a month draw - down , a civilian - military “ conflict is inevitable , ” and might , as the Nation ’s Robert Dreyfuss suggests , even lead to an Obama “ showdown ” with the military high command in his first weeks in office .
In a nutshell , the Pentagon ’s argument could n’t be simpler or more red-bloodedly American :
We have too much stuff to leave Iraq any time soon .
In war , as in peace , we ’re trapped by our own profligacy .
We are the Neiman Marcus and the Wal - Mart of combat .
Where we go , our “ stuff ” goes with us  in such prodigious quantities that removing it is going to prove more daunting than invading in the first place .
After all , it took less than a year to put in place the 130,000 - plus invasion force , and all its equipment and support outfits from bases all around the world , as well as the air power and naval power to match .
Some have estimated , however , that simply getting each of the 14 combat brigades still stationed in Iraq on January 20 , 2009 , out with all their equipment might take up to 75 days per brigade .
( If you do the math , that ’s 36 months , and even that would n’t suffice if you wanted to remove everything else we now have in that California - sized country . )
Getting out ?
Do n’t dream of it .
Going to War with the Society You Have
Back in December 2004 , when a soldier at a base in Kuwait asked about the lack of armor on his unit ’s Humvees , Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld famously said , “ As you know , you have to go to war with the Army you have ? ”
Rumsfeld was then still focused on his much - ballyhooed “ transformation ” in warfare .
He was intent on creating a Military Lite  the most pared down , totally agile , completely networked , highest of all high - tech forces that was going to make the US the dominant power on the planet for eons .
As it turned out , that force was a mirage .
In reality , the US military in Iraq proved to be a Military Heavy .
In retrospect , Rumsfeld might have more accurately responded :
You have to go to war with the society you have .
In fact , the Bush administration did just that  with a passion .
After the attacks of 9/11 , the President famously pleaded with the American public to return to normal life by shopping , flying , and visiting Disney World .
( “ Take your families and enjoy life , the way we want it to be enjoyed . ” )
The administration and the Pentagon led the way .
As the Pentagon ’s budget soared , its civilians and the high command went on an imperial spending spree the likes of which may never have been seen on this planet .
For them , Iraq has been war as cornucopia , war as a consumer ’s paradise .
Arguably , on a per-soldier basis , no military has ever occupied a country with a bigger baggage train .
On taking Iraq , they promptly began constructing a series of gigantic military bases , American ziggurats meant to outlast them .
These were full - scale “ American towns , ” well guarded , 15 - 20 miles around , with multiple PXes , fitness clubs , brand fast - food outlets , traffic lights , the works .
( This , in a country where , for years after the invasion , nothing worked . )
To the tune of multi-billions of dollars , they continued to build these bases up , and then , in Baghdad , put the icing on the Iraqi cake by constructing an almost three - quarter - billion dollar embassy of embassies , a veritable citadel in the heart of the capital ’s American - controlled Green Zone , meant for 1,000 “ diplomats ” with its own pool , tennis courts , recreation center , post exchange / community center , commissary , retail and shopping areas , and restaurants  again , the works .
In other words , abroad , we were n’t the Spartans , we were the Athenians on steroids .
And then , of course , there was the “ equipment ” that Mullen referred to , the most expensive and extensive collection you could find .
As the Washington Times ’s Arnaud de Borchgrave wrote back in October 2007 : “ Watching them drive by at 30 miles per hour , would take 75 days .
Bumper - to - bumper , they would stretch from New York City to Denver .
That ’s how US Air Force logistical expert Lenny Richoux described the number of vehicles that would have to be shipped back from Iraq when the current deployment is over .
These include , among others , 10,000 flatbed trucks , 1,000 tanks and 20,000 Humvees . ”
And do n’t forget “ the 300,000 ‘ heavy ’ items that would have to be shipped back , such as ice - cream machines that churn out different flavors upon request at a dozen bases ? ”
As Dr. Seuss might have put it : and that is not all , oh no , that is not all .
In July 2007 , for instance , the Associated Press ’s Charles Hanley described US bases holding “ more than the thousands of tanks , other armored vehicles , artillery pieces and Humvees assigned to combat units .
They ’re also home to airfields laden with high - tech gear , complexes of offices filled with computers , furniture and air conditioners , systems of generators and water plants , PXs full of merchandise , gyms packed with equipment , big prefab latrines and ranks of small portable toilets , even Burger Kings and Subway sandwich shops . ”
And it does n’t stop there .
In mid-2007 , when the issue of our “ stuff ” first became part of the withdrawal news , Secretary of Defense Robert Gates pointed out : “ You ’re talking about not just US soldiers , but millions of tons of contractor equipment that belongs to the United States government , and a variety of other things ?
This is a massive logistical undertaking whenever it takes place . ”
So , one might ask , what about those many tens of thousands of private contractors in Iraq and all their materiel ?
Presumably , some of them , too , would have to withdraw , mainly through the bottleneck of Kuwait and its overburdened ports .
This would , as the military now portrays it , be an American Dunkirk stretching on for years .
The Argument of Last Resort
Now , back in the days when we had less experience fighting losing wars , Americans in retreat simply shoved those extra helicopters off the decks of aircraft carriers in chaos , burned free - floating cash in tin drums , and left tons of expensive equipment and massive bases behind for the enemy to turn into future industrial parks .
At the US Embassy in Saigon in April 1975 , while everything in sight was being burned or destroyed including precious advanced electronic equipment , money actually rained down from the Embassy incinerator on the roof upon amazed Vietnamese allies huddled below , waiting for a promised airlift to safety that , for most , never came .
Withdrawal then was unsightly , unseemly , and environmentally unsound .
But , as we know , the lessons of Vietnam were subsequently learned .
Today , the Pentagon and the military top command plan to be far more responsible consumers and far better environmentalists , however long it takes , and the Department of Agriculture ’s “ stringent requirements ” for the “ power - washing ”  this , in the desert , of course  of every object to be returned to the US will help ensure that this is so .
“ Ever since US authorities found plague - infected rats in cargo returning from the Vietnam War , ” the AP ’s Hanley has written , “ the decontamination process has been demanding : water blasting of equipment , treatment with insecticide and rodenticide , inspections , certifications . ”
And do n’t forget the shrink - wrapping of those helicopters  who knows how many  for that long , salt - free sea voyage home .
Think of this as a version of the Pottery Barn Rule that Secretary of State Colin Powell supposedly cited in warning President Bush on the dangers of invading Iraq : “ You break it , you own it . ”
For the departure from Iraq , this might be rewritten as : You bring it , you own it .
You might say that , in the end , Bush ’s secret plan for never withdrawing from Iraq was but an extension of his shop - till - you - drop response to 9/11 .
The idea was to put so much stuff in the country that we ’d have to stay .
And now , as the mission threatens to wind down , the top brass are evidently claiming that an Obama timeline for withdrawal would violate our property rights and squander a vast array of expensive equipment .
You ’ll hear no apologies from the military for traveling heavy , despite the fact that they are now arguing against a reasonable withdrawal timetable based on the need to enact a kind of 12 - step program for armed consumer sobriety .
Ever since the President ’s surge strategy was launched in January 2007 , this argument has been a background hum in the withdrawal debate .
Now , it ’s evidently about to come front and center .
A new president will be taking office .
His withdrawal plan  he spoke of it more accurately on CBS ’s 60 Minutes as “ a plan that draws down our troops ”  is a modest one .
After those American “ combat brigades ” are out , it ’s still possible , as one of his key security advisers , former Navy Secretary Richard Danzig , told National Public Radio last summer , that as many as 55,000 US troops might remain in an advisory capacity or as residual forces .
And yet , with the Iraqis urging us on , so many of the arguments against withdrawal have fallen away , which is why , when Barack Obama sits down in the Oval Office with his top commanders , he ’s going to hear about all that “ stuff . ”
For those who want to drag their feet on leaving Iraq , this is the argument of last resort .
As Donald Rumsfeld so classically said , in reference to the looting of Baghdad in April 2003 after American troops entered the city , “ stuff happens . ”
How true that turns out to be .
When it comes to withdrawal , the most militarily profligate administration in memory has seemingly ensured that the highest military priority in 2009 will be frugality  that is , saving all American “ stuff ” in Iraq .
Irony hardly covers this one .
The Bush administration may have succeeded in little else , but it did embed the US so deeply in that country that leaving can now be portrayed as the profligate thing to do .
By the way , in case anyone thinks that the soon - to - be - Bush - less Pentagon has drawn the obvious lessons from its experience in Iraq , think again .
It still seems eager to visit Disney World .
According to Wired Magazine ’s reliable Danger Room blog , military officials are now suggesting to the Obama transition team that the next Pentagon budget should come in at $ 581 billion , a staggering $ 67 billion more than the previous one ( and that ’s without almost all the costs of the Afghan and Iraq wars being included ) .
But like Rumsfeld ’s Military Lite , the Pentagon ’s Military Heavy plans are likely to prove a mirage in the economic future that awaits us .
Perhaps the US should indeed salvage every bit of its equipment in Iraq .
After all , one thing seems certain : Washington may continue in some fashion to garrison an economically desperate world , but it will never again have the money to occupy a country in the style of Iraq  largely because the Bush administration managed to squander the American imperial legacy in eight short years .
Someday , Iraq and all those massive bases , all that high - tech equipment , all those ice - cream machines and portajohns , will seem like part of an American dream life .
Money may never again rain from the sky .

Comcast says it will lend a helping hand to Vonage , the Internet phone company , to make sure the cable giant 's network management techniques do n't mess up Vonage 's phone service .
This is good news for Vonage , which is already fighting to keep its customers .
And it 's a nice bit of corporate image fluffing for Comcast , which looks like a better company for helping out its direct competitor .
But this is a dangerous precedent -- and one Comcast should re-think .
What exactly are the companies doing together ?
You 'd never know from the nonsensical press release the companies sent out yesterday .
But the WSJ uncovers some details today : Comcast and Vonage will have " a direct line of communications " between their network operations centers -- presumably a speed dial button on a bat phone somewhere .
And Vonage will participate in " testing the impact of Comcast 's network management techniques on its service . "
Sounds harmless , right ?
But what happens if Comcast finds out that some of its network management algorithms actually do affect Vonage 's phone service ?
What if they make changes to the way their system works to accommodate Vonage ?
If so , then Comcast is saying that they 'll tweak the way their networks work because of a business relationship with another company .
So will they make sure eBay 's ( EBAY )
Skype works , too ?
Google 's ( GOOG ) GrandCentral ?
T - Mobile 's @ Home phone service ?
Jajah ?
Apple 's ( AAPL ) iChat ?
Where does it end ?
Will they have to make sure YouTube works , or Hulu ?
If so , then the idea of net neutrality -- that every bit of information that goes across Comcast 's network gets treated the same -- is even more of a farce .
We do n't have an ideal solution for Comcast .
Obviously telecom companies need to somehow regulate the way their networks function .
And Vonage knew before it started that it would always be relying on other companies ' pipes for its lifeline .
But tweaking the way the Internet works based on a commercial relationship -- even for consumers ' thereotical benefit -- is a scary precedent .

Cloning from the grave : Scientists create new life from a mouse that has been frozen for 16 YEARS
Scientists have created clones of a mouse that had been dead and frozen for 16 years .
It is the first time they have been able to clone a frozen animal .
The Japanese researchers say their work will benefit mankind - and could be used to bring back extinct animals such as the woolly mammoth or sabre tooth tiger .
Breakthrough : Scientists have cloned a healthy brown mouse for the first time from an animal kept in the deep freeze for 16 years
But ethical watchdogs branded the experiment disturbing .
Critics say it brings the world closer to the day when people try to clone long - dead relatives stored in cryopreservation clinics .
It could even lead to a macabre new industry - in which people leave behind ' relics ' of their bodies in freezers in the hope that they could one day be cloned .
The gullible might be persuaded that they themselves could be brought back to life , complete with their memories , even though a clone would be a different person in almost everything except appearance .
The latest experiment comes more than 11 years after British scientists stunned the world with Dolly the cloned sheep .
Although scientists have since cloned a host of different animals , using genetic material from single cells , they have always used living cells .
It had been thought that ice crystals destroyed the DNA in frozen cells , making them unusable .
But the Japanese team used brain cells and believe the high fat content of brains and the protection of the skull reduced the damage .
Josephine Quintavalle , an expert on the ethics of fertility and reproduction , said the experiment pushed the boundaries of acceptable science even further .
She said : ' This kind of research raises disturbing questions about what happens to our bodies - and any tissue we leave for medical science - after we die .
' It means that tissue donated for medical research or stored in laboratories could be used many years later for cloning research .
Return of the dead :
The dead mouse from which the new mouse was cloned .
' It has never been more important that when people leave tissue for research , the consent should be very specific given the potential for all kinds of scientific developments in the future . '
But British scientists welcomed the breakthrough .
Professor Malcolm Alison , biologist at Barts and the London School of Medicine and Dentistry , said : " It is absolutely fascinating .
' The researchers obtained cell nuclei from mice that had been deep - frozen for 16 years and then generated new mice by the same technology that created Dolly .
' While 16 years is not a long time for cells to be frozen - IVF clinics often have viable sperm frozen for longer periods - there are no scientific reasons why extinct animals like mammoths could not be similarly generated . '
The research was carried out by Dr Teruhiko Wakayama and colleagues at the Centre for Developmental Biology in Kobe , Japan .
They took brain cells from ordinary dead male mice stored in a freezer for up to 16 years and removed their nuclei - the blobs in the centre of cells that contain DNA .
Each cell 's nucleus was injected into a hollowed - out egg cell from a female mouse .
When the egg was ' triggered ' with electricity , it began to divide and grow just like a newly - conceived embryo .
After a few days , the embryo clone was implanted into the womb of a surrogate mouse and three weeks later , the clone was born .
' These cloned mice did not show any abnormalities and grew to adulthood , ' the researchers report today in the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences today
Cells to be frozen are normally treated with chemicals called cryoprotectants - beforehand , to prevent - damage .
But this had not been done on the Japanese mice .
The researchers tried to clone mice from other parts of the body , but found that brain cells were the most successful .
Even using brain cells , however , the success rate was low .
More than 1,100 attempts produced just seven healthy clones .
More than 500 embryos died after being implanted into the wombs of the surrogate mothers .
Helen Wallace of Genewatch UK said : ' Cloning produces high failure rates because many eggs and foetuses do not develop normally .
' It would be extremely dangerous for both mothers and their babies to attempt this kind of experiment in humans . '
Critics warn that the advance could lead to the cloning of historical species such as mammoths and sabre toothed tigers
Dr Robin Lovell - Badge of the Medical Research Council 's National Institute for Medical Research in London said the breakthrough could help scientists researching diseases by producing more material to work on .
He said : ' It could be a valuable practical tool - not just for work on animals but on humans as well .
Extreme : Scientists could potentially create living clones of the ice man ' Oetzi ' , who was frozen 5,300 years ago
' There might be human material stored by laboratories that you could work on .
' If it came from people with genetic diseases , it could help explore the causes of those disease . '
However Dr Robin Lovell - Badge said he suspected the technique would have most use in the research on extinct animals , such as mammoths , whose bodies are preserved for thousands of year in ice or frozen tundra .
Frankenstein science :
The revelation conjures images of a world where people could be cloned and brought back from the dead .
In the 2003 film Multiplicity , Michael Keaton plays several cloned variations of himself
The Japanese scientists said the bodies of large animals like mammoths frozen under natural conditions would freeze more slowly , possibly reducing cell damage .
They also suggested that other sources of frozen nuclei , such as white blood cells , might be as useful for cloning as brain tissue .
They added : ' This would increase the chances of finding tissues in good condition ' .

Reverse HTTP is an experimental protocol which takes advantage of the HTTP / 1.1 Upgrade : header to turn one HTTP socket around .
When a client makes a request to a server with the Upgrade : PTTH /0.9 header , the server may respond with an Upgrade : PTTH / 1.0 header , after which point the server starts using the socket as a client , and the client starts using the socket as a server .
There is also a COMET - style protocol which will work with HTTP / 0.9 or 1.1 clients that do not know how to perform this upgrade .
March 2009 : Zero and Donovan submitted an Internet - Draft formally describing this .
Below is an example transcript using Reverse HTTP .
Lines on the left are traffic from the client to the server .
Lines on the right are traffic from the server to client .
Lines with a red background are HTTP requests .
Lines with a green background are HTTP responses .
The transcript was created by sniffing the traffic from running this script [ 1 ] .
Request Response
client -> server server -> client POST / HTTP /1.1 Host : localhost:9999 Accept - Encoding : identity Upgrade : PTTH/0.9 HTTP /1.1 101 Switching Protocols Content - type : text / plain Upgrade : PTTH/0.9 Date : Tue , 13 May 2008 20:14:45 GMT

Content - Length : 15 ! dlrow , olleH
COMET Fallback
If the client or server is incapable of upgrading from HTTP , a COMET - style protocol can be used instead .
The server can maintain an event queue and require that the client repeatedly POST to the queue 's resource to receive events .
Below is a protocol trace using JSON as the protocol encoding .
POST / HTTP /1.1 Host : localhost:9999 Accept - Encoding : identity HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content - type : application / json Date : Tue , 13 May 2008 20:14:45 GMT
Content - Length : 210 {'message -id ' : ' xxx ' , ' method ' : ' GET ' , ' request-uri ' : '/' , ' http-version ' : ' PTTH/0.9 ' , ' headers ' : [ [ ' Host ' , ' 127.0.0.1:65331 ' ] , [ ' Accept - Encoding ' , ' identity ' ] , [ ' Accept ' , 'text / plain;q=1,*/*;q=0 ' ] ] , ' body ' : } POST / HTTP /1.1 Host : localhost:9999 Accept - Encoding : identity Content - type : application / json Content - length : 193 {'message -id ' : ' xxx ' , ' http-version ' : ' PTTH/0.9 ' , ' status ' : 200 , ' reason ' : ' OK ' , ' headers ' : [ [ ' Content - type ' , ' text / plain ' ] , [ ' Date ' , ' Tue , 13 May 2008 20:14:45 GMT ' ] ] , ' body ' : '! dlrow , olleH'} HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content - type : application / json Date : Tue , 13 May 2008 20:14:45 GMT
Content - Length : 2 {}
A response of {} from the server means no server - side event occurred within some timeout , and that the client should poll again if it wants to keep receiving events .
Another idea is to use text / plain encoding instead of JSON , and just have the actual text of the HTTP request in the response , and the text of the response in the next request .
In this case , the message - id would be relayed in a header instead of in the body .
Perhaps the message id should always be relayed in a header and never in the body ?
Judge says UC can deny religious course credit CALIFORNIA University need not give credit for classes that omit , deny facts
A federal judge says the University of California can deny course credit to applicants from Christian high schools whose textbooks declare the Bible infallible and reject evolution .
Rejecting claims of religious discrimination and stifling of free expression , U.S. District Judge James Otero of Los Angeles said UC 's review committees cited legitimate reasons for rejecting the texts - not because they contained religious viewpoints , but because they omitted important topics in science and history and failed to teach critical thinking .
Otero 's ruling Friday , which focused on specific courses and texts , followed his decision in March that found no anti-religious bias in the university 's system of reviewing high school classes .
Now that the lawsuit has been dismissed , a group of Christian schools has appealed Otero 's rulings to the Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco .
" It appears the UC is attempting to secularize private religious schools , " attorney Jennifer Monk of Advocates for Faith and Freedom said Tuesday .
Her clients include the Association of Christian Schools International , two Southern California high schools and several students .
Charles Robinson , the university 's vice president for legal affairs , said the ruling " confirms that UC may apply the same admissions standards to all students and to all high schools without regard to their religious affiliations . "
What the plaintiffs seek , he said , is a " religious exemption from regular admissions standards . "
The suit , filed in 2005 , challenged UC 's review of high school courses taken by would - be applicants to the 10 - campus system .
Most students qualify by taking an approved set of college preparatory classes ; students whose courses lack UC approval can remain eligible by scoring well in those subjects on the Scholastic Assessment Test .
Christian schools in the suit accused the university of rejecting courses that include any religious viewpoint , " any instance of God 's guidance of history , or any alternative ... to evolution . "
But Otero said in March that the university has approved many courses containing religious material and viewpoints , including some that use such texts as " Chemistry for Christian Schools " and " Biology : God 's Living Creation , " or that include scientific discussions of creationism as well as evolution .
UC denies credit to courses that rely largely or entirely on material stressing supernatural over historic or scientific explanations , though it has approved such texts as supplemental reading , the judge said .
For example , in Friday 's ruling , he upheld the university 's rejection of a history course called Christianity 's Influence on America .
According to a UC professor on the course review committee , the primary text , published by Bob Jones University , " instructs that the Bible is the unerring source for analysis of historical events " and evaluates historical figures based on their religious motivations .
Another rejected text , " Biology for Christian Schools , " declares on the first page that " if ( scientific ) conclusions contradict the Word of God , the conclusions are wrong , " Otero said .
He also said the Christian schools presented no evidence that the university 's decisions were motivated by hostility to religion .
UC attorney Christopher Patti said Tuesday that the judge assessed the review process accurately .
" We evaluate the courses to see whether they prepare these kids to come to college at UC , " he said .
" There was no evidence that these students were in fact denied the ability to come to the university . "
But Monk , the plaintiffs ' lawyer , said Otero had used the wrong legal standard and had given the university too much deference .
" Science courses from a religious perspective are not approved , " she said .
" If it comes from certain publishers or from a religious perspective , UC simply denies them . "
The Navy wants a smarter bomb .
Not just a bomb that can land within a few meters of the bull 's eye — but a bomb that can do so , with just the right amount of blast .
On Monday , the Navy posted a request for information on possible concepts for " selectable output weapons . "
According to the description , this future weapon would have a variable blast radius , limiting the potential for civilian casualties , often referred to as " collateral damage . "
" Current cylindrical steel - cased blast fragmentation warheads distribute fragmentation radially in all directions from the detonation point .
Often , many fragments travel far beyond the intended target .
These fragments can create collateral damage hazards , " the Navy understates .
And that can lead , alas , to " restricted rules of engagement . "
Currently no technology has been proven to be available that can deliver variable damage radius from one build configuration .
Developing this sort of weapon could improve tactical flexibility and effectiveness by maximizing the number of kills per sortie and reducing the timeline necessary to prosecute a wider spectrum of targets . *
The American military has rarely been under greater pressure to keep noncombatants safe .
Every misfire in the U.S. air war over Afghanistan and Pakistan becomes another international incident — and a propaganda win for the Taliban .
The Navy has already deployed something called the Low Collateral Damage Bomb , which is essentially a 500 - pound JDAM with most of the explosive fill removed .
Designing a variable yield bomb is a bit more challenging — and you still have to deal with the problem of blast fragments from a steel casing .
This is not a formal competition , however .
At this point , the Navy is asking interested parties ( we assume that means everyone from garage tinkerers to defense contractors ) to submit idea papers : 12 - point type , single spaced , 10 pages max .

COMICS ?! [ Dec. 23rd , 2005 | 11:52 am ] found objects

My boyfriend inherited a stupidly huge collection of comic books , and mixed in with all the X - Men and Superman , we found something truly bizarre .
I do n't know how this was made , how its makers got permission , or how it got in there .
And I 'm posting Very Big Photos of this so you can read every bit of Very Brain - Numbing Text .
So let 's take a whirlwind ride along with Ziggy Stardust in his latest comic - book adventure ....
The cover .
It appears the entire point of this cover was to ensure that nobody in their right mind would want to be seen buying or reading this .
Fans this obsessed are not in their right minds , though .
I do n't know what 's with the bad grammar , and I do n't know why the second face from top looks like the evil chick from Ghostbusters .
Here we learn that David flies around the galaxy defeating badness .
But he does it as his alter ego , Ziggy Stardust , who is very real to everyone except Bowie who has no idea this all is happening .
Bowie - er , Ziggy - decides the best way to defeat the psychic fuckstick dragon is to get a good mid-air rogering from Ozzy Osbourne .
Oh no !
What is this ?!
The evil Elton John appears in his Biplane of Obviously Closeted Gayness !
Some other crap happens , and then wham bang boom , Ziggy turns into mild - mannered David once more .
All these acid trips psychic space journeys are where he gets his inspiration , you know .
But what is this ?!
Some random fangirl Kate Bush ( thanks , thegreatesthits
The Council of Superheroes .
I think I can see Mick Jagger , Batman , and Freddie Mercury .
I DO NOT UNDERSTAND , AND FURTHERMORE , I AM EMBARRASSED ON BEHALF OF EVERY POOR SCHMUCK WHO GOT PUT IN HERE .
It looks like a good kind of strange ...
Apparently none of these psychotic fans have ever actually SEEN David Bowie .
He 's all kinds of skinny and non-buff .
At the end of the adventure , life returns to normal , David returns to the cocaine , and nobody has any idea what really happened .
Much like his after - show parties , or so I 've heard .
And the back cover , because ... gawd .
The horribleness , it 's amazing .
Interestingly enough , they have other titles in this " series . "
About bands like KISS , Led Zeppelin , and ...
Motley Crue ?!
I do n't want to know what goes into a comic about 80s hairmetal bands .
I really do NOT want to know .
UPDATE : The Deal.com hears that $ 100 million of the $ 500 million offer was cash .
EARLIER : Facebook offered to buy Twitter for $ 500 million of overvalued Facebook stock , Kara Swisher says .
Twitter rejected the offer for several reasons :
At Facebook 's real valuation , $ 5 billion or so , the offer only amounted to $ 150 million ( not bad for two - year old company with no revenue , but a far cry from the billion - dollar dream )
( not bad for two - year old company with no revenue , but a far cry from the billion - dollar dream )
Twitter has high hopes for its own secret revenue model which will be announced next year .
Twitter 's investors are n't stupid :
They wanted cash .
Facebook presumably does n't have that much cash to spare .
Kara Swisher :
The $ 500 million offered was in an all - stock form , said sources on both sides , at the $ 15 billion valuation that came from the Microsoft investment in the company last October .
The Twitter side felt that figure was inflated and the shares should be valued at the lower figures that have also been reported for Facebook ’s true valuation , more in the $ 5 billion range .
That would have given the deal a $ 150 million price tag , which was seen as too low , especially since it was in Facebook stock and not cash .
In fact , Twitter wanted cash , which was not possible for Facebook , or Facebook stock at an even lower valuation that $ 5 billion .
But , said several sources close to Twitter , the primary reason for not selling was because its board simply did not want to yet or perhaps ever .
Said one source : “ The question is , is it really a good idea to sell on the first chance you get ? ” ...
“ It ’s more about timing , ” said one person familiar with Twitter ’s motivations .
“ There is a strong feeling that there is still an opportunity –even with the economic downturn –to blow this thing out . ”

That ’s the title of a new report from Jan Hatzius et al at Goldman Sachs ( not available online ) .
The Goldman guys , like me , come up with scary figures about the size of the gap in demand that needs to be filled — figures that suggest the need for a fiscal stimulus that ’s enormous by historical standards .
Their approach is different , and probably better than mine ; I ’ll get to that in a bit .
But I want to talk conceptual stuff for a moment .
It ’s a curious thing that even now , when we are clearly in a liquidity trap , we still have a lot of economists denying that such a thing is possible .
The argument seems to go like this : creating inflation is easy — birds do it , bees do it , Zimbabwe does it .
So it ca n’t really be a problem for competent countries like Japan or the United States .
This misses a key point that I and others tried to make for Japan in the 90s and are trying to make again now : creating inflation is easy if you ’re an irresponsible country .
It may not be easy at all if you are n’t .
A decade ago , when I tried to make sense of Japan ’s predicament , I used a simple , unrealistic model to ask what we really know about the relationship between the money supply and the price level .
We normally say that an increase in the money supply , other things equal , leads to an equal proportional increase in the price level : double M and you double the CPI .
But that ’s not actually right .
What a model with all the i’s dotted and t’s crossed actually says is that the CPI doubles if you double the current money supply and all future expected money supplies .
And how do you do that ?
No matter how much Japan increases the monetary base now , expectations of future money supplies wo n’t move if people believe that the Bank of Japan will move to stabilize the price level as soon as the economy recovers .
And once you realize that central banks may not be able to move expectations about future money supplies , it becomes a real possibility that the economy will be in a liquidity trap : if interest rates are near zero , money printed now just gets hoarded , and monetary policy has no traction on the real economy .
Zimbabwe would n’t have this problem : people believe that any money it prints will stay in circulation .
But the likes of Japan , or the United States , print money for policy purposes , not to pay their bills .
And that , perversely , is what makes them vulnerable to a liquidity trap .
Back in 1998 I argued that the Bank of Japan needed to find a way to “ credibly promise to be irresponsible . ”
That did n’t go down too well , but it was what sober , careful economic analysis prescribed .
Or as I said in the linked paper ,
The whole subject of the liquidity trap has a sort of Alice - through - the - looking - glass quality .
Virtues like saving , or a central bank known to be strongly committed to price stability , become vices ; to get out of the trap a country must loosen its belt , persuade its citizens to forget about the future , and convince the private sector that the government and central bank are n’t as serious and austere as they seem .
OK , so now back to Hatzius et al .
They emphasize the role of the disruption of credit markets in pushing us into a liquidity trap .
They then turn to an estimate of likely changes in the “ private sector balance ” — the difference between private sector saving and private sector investment .
And it ’s stunning :
The GS house price forecast combined with current equity prices and credit spreads implies a rise in the private sector balance from +1 % of GDP in the second quarter of 2008 to +10 % in the fourth quarter of 2009 — – a rise of 9 percentage points , or 6 points at an annual rate .
What ’s the answer ?
Huge fiscal stimulus , to fill the hole .
More aggressive GSE lending .
Maybe a “ pre-commitment ” by the Fed to keep rates low for an extended period — that ’s a more genteel version of my “ credibly promise to be irresponsible . ”
And maybe large - scale purchases of risky assets .
The main thing to realize is that for the time being we really are in an alternative universe , in which nothing would be more dangerous than an attempt by policy makers to play it safe .
In the wake of crushing defeats for Republicans in last week ’s national elections , Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger said Sunday that his party should regroup by moving away from some of its core conservative principles and embracing spending on programs that Americans want .
“ I think the important thing for the Republican Party is now to also look at other issues that are very important for this country and not to get stuck in ideology , ” the governor said in an interview broadcast on CNN .
“ Let ’s go and talk about healthcare reform .
Let ’s go and . . . fund programs if they ’re necessary programs and not get stuck just on the fiscal responsibility . ”
Schwarzenegger , a social moderate , long ago earned the enmity of many California Republicans who believe he abandoned some of the fiscally conservative views he espoused when running for office five years ago .
They cite , for instance , his failed plan to dramatically expand health insurance in the state .
Last week , Schwarzenegger further angered Republicans by proposing a statewide sales - tax increase to balance the budget .

But the governor has not previously been so openly critical of the approach of the conservative bloc that dominates his party on the national level .
He said that Republicans had “ a very good party ” and that he had no plans to leave it because he agrees with the GOP ’s push to reduce restrictions on business and remain tough on crime .
Schwarzenegger said , however , that the GOP should support greater investment to build roads and fix schools and fund other “ things that the American people want to have done . ”
Republicans should not “ always just say , ‘ This is spending .
We ca n’t do that , ’ ” the governor said .
“ No , do n’t get stuck with that .
We have heard that dialogue .
Let ’s move on . ”
Schwarzenegger told CNN ’s John King that he believed Sen .
John McCain would have won the presidency if not for the plunging stock market in the days leading up to the Nov. 4 election .

The governor deflected a question about whether McCain had displayed bad judgment in selecting Gov. Sarah Palin of Alaska as his running mate .
He also said that California First Lady Maria Shriver , a Democrat and a member of the Kennedy family , had been running around their house since Tuesday with a cardboard cutout of President - elect Barack Obama , gloating over his victory .
Schwarzenegger , who joked about Obama ’s “ scrawny ” physique while campaigning with McCain , said he was “ proud ” to see the American people elect their first African American president .
“ I was touched by it , ” he said .
“ Democrats and Republicans should do everything they can to help this man and his administration to be successful . ”

But he said rumors that he would leave his post as governor to work in the Obama administration were not valid .

Phoning home : Smokey 's owner said he was a " talkative bird " A missing cockatiel is now safe and sound at home after confirming its own name in a phone call to its owner .
Accountant Sue Hill , who found the bird in Wrexham , was put in touch with a possible owner by a local vet .
When she called the number she let the bird listen to the voice at the other end of the phone - at which point it chirped its own name : " Smokey . "
Mrs
Hill said it was the first time the bird had spoken , which convinced her she had found its owner .
Smokey the grey cockatiel went missing for two days after flying out of the door of David and Carole Edwards ' home in Wrexham .
My heart went when he flew away ... it was the worst feeling in the world .
David Edwards , Smokey 's owner Mrs Hill , who lives about two miles ( 3.2 km ) away , spotted him in a tree and he flew down to perch on her shoulder .
She said : " I did n't really know what to do , so I just carried on walking .
One man walked past with his dog and said , ' Why do n't you get a dog like everyone else ? '
" I must have looked really silly .
" I took him home because I did n't think he would survive , and it was a Sunday so there was nobody I could really contact .
" But the following morning I rang the local vet and amazingly , they had been contacted by someone that morning . "
The vet passed on a telephone number for the Edwards ' , and Mrs Hill set out to prove they were the real owners .
Mr Edwards said he was grateful to Mrs Hill for returning Smokey She said : " Rather than me asking Mrs Edwards to describe the bird - because they probably all look very similar - she shouted down the phone .
" It was so amusing .
When she shouted ' Smokey ' he just responded straight away .
It was hysterical , and there was no doubt in my mind they were the owners . "
After being reunited with Smokey , owner Mr Edwards , a retired taxi driver , said : " He 's a one - in - a - million bird .
" My heart went when he flew away .
I did n't sleep for two nights , it was the worst feeling in the world .
I do n't mind admitting I shed a few tears on my way to pick him up .
" I was so relieved to hear he was safe .
" He 's a very talkative bird , but he never talks when you want him too , just when he feels like it . "
Mr Edwards , who also owns another bird , said he looked after Smokey for his grandson Ryan .
He added : " We let them fly around the house , they 're not kept in cages all the time , and that 's why he managed to get out .
" We 're so grateful for Sue for returning him safely to us . "

Scientists claim blueberries activate learning and memory in the brain
Eating blueberries can reverse memory loss and may have implications in the treatment of diseases like Alzheimer 's , University of Reading scientists claim .
Scientists found adding foods like blueberries to a regular diet , resulted in improvements in memory .
The foods , known as flavonoids , were historically believed to act as antioxidants in human bodies .
But the study indicates they also activate the part of the brain which controls learning and memory .
Dr Jeremy Spencer , from the department of food biosciences at the university , said : " Scientists have known of the potential health benefits of diets rich in fresh fruits for a long time .
" Our research provides scientific evidence to show that blueberries are good for you and supports the idea that a diet - based approach could potentially be used to increase memory capacity .
" We will be taking these findings to the next level by investigating the effects of diets rich in flavonoids on individuals suffering from cognitive impairment and possibly Alzheimer 's disease . "
The research has been published in the Free Radical Biology and Medicine journal .
Introduction and Overview
When you think of a high - powered graphics workstation , the first thing which typically comes to mind is a huge , bulky tower chassis , packed to the brim with multiple processors , high - end graphics cards , and multiple hard disks .
For the most part , this assumption is still fairly accurate , as these are the components which designers and artists usually require , and they are n't available anywhere else .
Thus , artists have more or less been chained to their desks and their big , perfectly calibrated monitors .
This is n't to say that there are n't options for the mobile workstation user , however , they have never really been up to par with what you could accomplish with a full tower .
Almost every major notebook provider out there has a mobile workstation product , although for graphic artists , the only truly well respected product lineup has been Apple 's MacBook Pro series .
Even with the most high - end MacBook Pro , however , you 're limited to what you can physically stuff into such a small form factor .
The solution ?
Go bigger .
That 's just what Lenovo has done with their massively large ( and equally impressive ) Thinkpad W700 model - the first laptop we 've seen which not only meets , but surpasses what Apple 's MacBook Pro can offer to the graphics professional .
While Apple tends to target the style - conscious designer types , Lenovo is going the other direction , providing a no - frills , high - end laptop which is absolutely packed with high - end hardware .
This is n't to say that the Thinkpad W700 is un-attractive ( it has its rugged , industrial charm ) , but it 's clear here that style is not Lenovo 's primary focus .
So , what is Lenovo 's primary focus ?
Performance .
Lenovo is offering hardware options which Apple is n't close to touching with their new W700 .
With the Lenovo W700 , you can configure systems with quad - core processors , up to 8GB of memory , multiple hard drives in RAID , and Nvidia 's latest lineup of mobile QuadroFX graphics processors , none of which are available on the PowerMac lineup today .
Not only does the W700 offer what Apple can't , it also offers configuration options which are unique to the rest of the PC space as well .
Some may assume that Lenovo is taking a brute - force approach to the mobile workstation market , but this is clearly not the case with the W700 .
Helping to refine this model are options for ultra-high resolution displays , optional hardware display color calibration ( a Lenovo first ) , and an optional Wacom digitizer ( another Lenovo first ) , all of which clearly show that Lenovo has the right frame of mind when attacking the mobile workstation market .
In terms of its specification , the Thinkpad W700 looks very impressive - and we were lucky enough to get our hands on one of the first shipping models , which we will now analyze in great depth on the following pages .
Enjoy !

The Chicago Sun-Times newspaper claims that formerly married Whitney Houston and Bobby Brown seem to be on the road to reunion .
The newspaper ’s source has recently seen them on a romantic date .
The singer ’s friends also state that it is very likely that they will get back together .
Whitney Houston ’s spokesman said : “ Bobby and Whitney are divorced but maintain friendly relationship as their daughter ’s well - being comes first for both of them . ”
By the way , some rumors say that their daughter , the 15 - year - old Bobbi Kristina , dreams about her parents becoming a couple again .
Perhaps the two are willing to do this for their child ’s sake .
Bobby Brown and Whitney Houston met in 1989 and got married three years later .
This marriage surprised many people , while others even blamed Bobby Brown for having a bad influence on Whitney .
Indeed , by that time Bobby already had issues with the laws , he also had three children from three different women whom he did not pay alimony , while Whitney was a good girl from a religious family .
In 1993 Bobbi Kristina was born .
But having a new member in his family did not bring noticeably positive impact on Bobby .
Over and over again he was arrested for drunk driving , accused of sexual harassment , and even received another prison sentence in 1996 .
Some sources say that this was the year when Whitney started doing drugs .
Brown was imprisoned for beating up his wife in 2003 .
Patient Whitney Houston filed for divorce only in September 2006 .
The marriage was officially terminated in April 2007 .
Whitney received absolute custody over her daughter .
Brown appealed to court for restoration of his custody rights and requested alimony payments from his wife .
The court did not grant his claim .
Whitney tried to return into the show business after the divorce with the help of her longtime manager Clive Davis .
So far , unfortunately , those attempts saw little success .
Also the singer remains silent about her long - promised new album .

Recently there have been a number of interesting announcements from Google on their geo data plans .
Two weeks ago Google launched Mapmaker , a site that will let anyone edit the mapping data for a series of countries .
Last week Google signed a five year deal to share mapping data with Tele Atlas , the world ’s second largest navigation data provider and a recent acquisition of Tomtom ( Radar post ) .
These moves caused a flurry of posts about the future of Google ’s data , who will have access to it , and how this may affect open data project Open Street Map .
I did a phone call last week with Lior Ron and Larry Yu of the team .
Mapmaker is a new web - based tool that lets signed - in users add features to certain countries in Google Maps .
The countries are currently limited to ones that Google feels are poorly covered .
The 18 countries include the Netherlands Antilles , Iceland , and Jamaica .
If you go to these countries in Mapmaker you will notice in the bottom right - hand corner that the Map Data and the Imagery are owned by Google ( see image above )
Some of the countries use other data in Google Maps , but they really are quite limited .
Open Street Map ( OSM ) is a geo project that lets anyone update it .
People donate time and energy uploading GPS tracks , building supporting software , and editing the core data ( here ’s their full guide to Map Making ) .
OSM is growing quickly .
As an open data project , OSM makes its data freely available to anyone .
This enables custom mapping applications like the OSM Cycle Map .
It is also being used commercially by on real estate site Nestoria and by VC - funded startup Cloudmade .
I am sure that seeing Google enter the wiki -map space will help OSM data find its way into more deals .
Their data is currently licensed under CC - BY - SA 2.0 , something that they are considering changing .
Google Maps has coverage of the entire globe ( as do its competitors like Live Maps and Yahoo !
Maps ) .
Most of the data that is used by Google Maps and displayed comes from Tele Atlas and NAVTEQ ( currently being purchased by Nokia ) .
Several months ago Google released the ability to move addresses ( for example my house has always shown up a block away on Google Maps ) or add a new place .
With this feature any logged in user can make an edit ; you can even watch the edits in a realtime viewer .
If your change is accepted it will show up in Google Maps .
Road geometry and address changes derived from Tele Atlas data will be sent back to Tele Atlas to help improve its information .
I assume that this updated data will eventually make it into new - owner Tomtom ’s GPSs and potentially Google ’s competitors who also use Tele Atlas .
The data collected via MapMaker will not be shared with Tele Atlas .
At this point in time Google is keeping all of the MapMaker data for itself .
However this is not necessarily their final plan .
In the phone call I had with Lior and Larry they made it clear that this was the first step .
There was no commitment for future releases but they made it clear that they are interested in making this data as useful as possible .
I find it highly unlikely that the Mapmaker project will stop here unless it is deemed a failure .
The Open Street Map blog makes the point that right now Google is asking people to give geo data for free without that data being made freely available back to them .
I do n’t think that most consumers see it that way .
I think that consumers see Google giving away massive amounts of functionality in exchange for looking at some often - unclicked ads .
Under those circumstances I am sure many do not mind that the data they contribute is not readily available to them .
What does “ make the data as useful as possible ” mean ?
Google ’s Geo team has had a history of making incremental releases ( look to the step - by - step integration of KML into Google Maps as an example ) .
Mapmaker first reared its head as an internal Google tool used to create maps for Africa ( with partner Tracks4Africa ) , Burma ( as seen in this Mapplet ) , and India ( via Google - supplied GPS kits as referenced by Michael Jones last summer – Radar post ) .
Now Mapmaker is a consumer editing tool .
In the future I think that we can expect the following releases :
Mapmaker expanded to other countries ( Based on the initial set of countries it seems that Google needs to own satellite imagery I would assume all if Google is able to meet its own TOS around derivative work )
Mapmaker derived data available by an API ( not available ; really a no - brainer )
Stepping more out on a limb I think that there is a chance that we will see raw Mapmaker data available for reuse in select countries .
Under what license I do not know .
There are a lot of countries that do not have good geodata where Google could really make a difference .
Releasing this data will generate a lot of goodwill from open data projects like OSM and ( perhaps more importantly ) humanitarian projects .
Though Mapmaker is ultimately a for - profit endeavor once the project is mature this type of openness will be worthwhile .
Security guards at a Radiohead show on Monday night at the Hollywood Bowl in Los Angeles ( right ) apparently beat up videographers in plain view of policemen who pretended to see nothing .
What , did they think they were in Denver ?
From the LA Weekly 's account , we pick up the action as security guards attempt to confiscate a video of them choking another concertgoer .
They were running after him saying , " That 's the guy with thecamera , " recalls another witness .
Dawes watched as Reich made his way through the Highlandtraffic , get hit by a car , recover and continue to run away from hispursuers ... " ( Reich ) figured , there 's no way that the security guards are just going to assault this random dude in front of a cop . "
He was wrong .
Then it gets really interesting .
They try to play " keep away " with the tape for a while as guards tackle them , throw them into walls and on the floor , and smash their heads into the ground .
When they pleaded with law enforcement on the scene , one officer said that they " give event staff leeway . "
The full account has to be read to be believed .

This post is part four of the zip folding series inspired by Max Rabkin ’s Beautiful folding post .
I meant to write one little post , but one post turned into four .
When I sense that something can be made simpler / clearer , I ca n’t leave it be .
To review :
Part One related Max ’s data representation of left folds to type class morphisms , a pattern that ’s been steering me lately toward natural ( inevitable ) design of libraries .
Part
Two simplified that representation to help get to the essence of zipping , and in doing so lost the expressiveness necessary to define Functor and Applicative instaces .
and instaces .
Part
Three proved the suitability of the zipping definitions in Part Two .
This post shows how to restore the Functor and Applicative ( very useful composition tools ) to folds but does so in a way that leaves the zipping functionality untouched .
This new layer is independent of folding and can be layered onto any zippable type .
You can get the code described below .
Edits :
2009 -02 - 15 : Simplified WithCont , collapsing two type parameters into one .
Added functor comment about cfoldlc ' .
What ’s missing ?
Max ’s fold type packages up the first two arguments of foldl ' and adds on an post - fold step , as needed for fmap :
data Fold b c = forall a . F ( a -> b -> a ) a ( a -> c ) -- clever version
The simpler , less clever version just has the two foldl ' arguments , and no forall :
data Fold b a = F ( a -> b -> a ) a -- simple version
Removing Max ’s post - fold step gets to the essence of fold zipping but loses some useful composability .
In particular , we can no longer define Functor and Applicative instances .
The difference between the clever version and the simple one is a continuation and a forall , which we can write down as follows :
data WithCont z c = forall a. WC ( z a ) ( a -> c )
The clever version is equivalent to the following :
type FoldC b = WithCont ( Fold b )
Interpreting a FoldC just interprets the Fold and then applies the continuation :
cfoldlc :: FoldC b a -> [ b ] -> a cfoldlc ( WC f k ) = k .
cfoldl f
( In a more general setting , use fmap in place of (. ) to give meaning to WithCont . )
Add a copy of WithCont , for reasons explained later , and use it for strict folds .
data WithCont ' z c = forall a. WC ' ( z a ) ( a -> c ) type FoldC ' b = WithCont ' ( Fold b ) cfoldlc ' :: FoldC' b a -> [ b ] -> a cfoldlc ' ( WC ' f k ) = k . cfoldl ' f
From Zip to Functor and Applicative
It ’s now a simple matter to recover the lost Functor and Applicative instances , for both non-strict and strict zipping .
The Applicative instances rely on zippability :
instance Functor ( WithCont z ) where fmap g ( WC f k ) = WC f ( g . k ) instance Zip z =>
Applicative ( WithCont z ) where pure a = WC undefined ( const a ) WC hf hk <*>
WC xf xk = WC ( hf `zip` xf ) ( ( a , a ' ) -> ( hk a ) ( xk a ' ) ) instance Functor ( WithCont ' z ) where fmap g ( WC ' f k ) = WC ' f ( g . k ) instance Zip ' z =>
Applicative ( WithCont ' z ) where pure a = WC ' undefined ( const a ) WC ' hf hk <*> WC ' xf xk = WC ' ( hf `zip '` xf ) ( ( P a a ' ) -> ( hk a ) ( xk a ' ) )
Now the reason for the duplicate WithCont definition becomes apparent .
Instance selection in Haskell is based entirely on the “ head ” of an instance .
If both Applicative instances used WithCont , the compiler would consider them to overlap .
Morphism proofs
It remains to prove that our interpretation functions are Functor and Applicative morphisms .
I ’ll show the non -strict proofs .
The strict morphism proofs go through similarly .
Functor
The Functor morphism property for non-strict folding :
cfoldlc ( fmap g wc ) == fmap g ( cfoldlc wc )
Adding some structure :
cfoldlc ( fmap g ( WC f k ) ) == fmap g ( cfoldlc ( WC f k ) )
Proof :
cfoldlc ( fmap g ( WC f k ) ) == {- fmap on WithCont -} cfoldlc ( WC f ( g . k ) ) == {- cfoldlc def -} ( g . k ) .
cfoldl f == {- associativity of (. ) -} g . ( k . cfoldl f ) == {- cfoldl def -} g .
cfoldlc ( WC f k ) == {- fmap on functions -} fmap g ( cfoldlc ( WC f k ) )
Applicative
Applicative has two methods , so cfoldlc must satisfy two morphism properties .
One for pure :
cfoldlc ( pure a ) == pure a
Proof :
cfoldlc ( pure a ) == {- pure on WithCont -} cfoldlc ( WC undefined ( const a ) ) == {- cfoldlc def -} const a .
cfoldl undefined == {- property of const -} const a == {- pure on functions -} pure a
And one for ( <*> ) :
cfoldlc ( wch <*> wcx ) == cfoldlc wch <*> cfoldlc wcx
Adding structure :
cfoldlc ( ( WC hf hk ) <*> ( WC xf xk ) ) == cfoldlc ( WC hf hk ) <*> cfoldlc ( WC xf xk )
Proof :
cfoldlc ( ( WC hf hk ) <*> ( WC xf xk ) ) == {- ( <*> ) on WithCont -} cfoldlc ( WC ( hf `zip` xf ) ( ( a , a ' ) -> ( hk a ) ( xk a ' ) ) ) == {- cfoldlc def -} ( ( a , a ' ) -> ( hk a ) ( xk a ' ) ) .
cfoldl ( hf `zip` xf ) == {- Zip morphism law for Fold -} ( ( a , a ' ) -> ( hk a ) ( xk a ' ) ) .
( cfoldl hf `zip` cfoldl xf ) == {- zip def on functions -} ( ( a , a ' ) -> ( hk a ) ( xk a ' ) ) . bs -> ( cfoldl hf bs , cfoldl xf bs ) == {- (. ) def -} bs -> ( hk ( cfoldl hf bs ) ) ( xk ( cfoldl xf bs ) ) == {- ( <*> ) on functions -} ( hk . cfoldl hf bs ) <*> ( xk . cfoldl xf ) == {- cfoldlc def , twice -} cfoldlc ( WC hf hk ) <*> cfoldlc ( WC xf xk )
That ’s it .
I like that WithCont allows composing the morphism proofs , in addition to the implementations .
This post is part four of the zip folding series inspired by Max Rabkin ’s Beautiful folding post .
I meant to write one little post , but one post turned into four ....
The sun is sinking fast behind the trees of an olive grove on the outskirts of the West Bank village of Nilin .
After a day of confrontations between the Israeli army and the Palestinian villagers over Israel ’s building of its separation wall on Nilin ’s land , the soldiers appear finally to have gone .
Overlooked by the homes of the neighboring Jewish settlement of Hashmonaim , a handful of Nilin ’s braver teenagers finally come out to work .
Jamal and Abed are sweating from their efforts to beat both nightfall and the return of the army .
They stand proudly , the fronts of their T - shirts turned out to hold a bulging stash of used tear gas canisters and stun grenades .
Each is worth one shekel ( 25c ) in scrap value , and between them they have at least 50 canisters .
Nilin , midway between Jerusalem and Tel Aviv , is home to nearly 5,000 Palestinians .
Known as the " village of entrepreneurs " , it has more than its share of millionaires .
But that looks set to change .
Traditionally , Nilin has enjoyed the benefits not only of a thriving agricultural industry on its plentiful outlying lands , but also of four factories that supply goods ranging from cola to fuel to Palestinians across the Ramallah region .
But Jamal and Abed , who nervously laugh and refuse to answer when asked for their full names , appear to be the face of Nilin ’s future business prospects .
Encircled by half a dozen Jewish settlements like Hashmonaim  all illegal under international law  the village is slowly being sealed off in a fashion that may soon make its isolation almost as complete as Gaza’s .
Since May , Israel has begun building its separation barrier along one length of the village , cutting it off from 250 hectares , or 40 per cent , of its farmland .
The land will be effectively annexed to the neighboring settlements .
Copying the strategy of nearby Palestinian villages , the people of Nilin have begun a campaign of mainly nonviolent protests to delay the work in the hope that world opinion , or the Israeli courts , will win them a reprieve .
In the meantime , a series of violent incidents by the army have claimed several lives in the village .
The army has also experimented with new techniques to break up the demonstrations , including a foul - smelling liquid called Skunk which is sprayed on protesters .
After such clashes Jamal and Abed cash in  the Palestinian equivalent of poor children rifling through bins looking for used drinks cans .
The pair dodge through the trees each evening under cover of dusk collecting empty canisters left behind by the army .
If Nilin ’s farmers face the imminent demise of their livelihoods with the confiscation of their land , Nilin ’s businessmen may not be far behind .
B’Tselem , an Israeli human rights group , has seen plans drafted by the Israeli army to seal off the crossroads at the entrance to the village , the only access in and out of Nilin .
Currently it is controlled by an army checkpoint , the location where a bound Palestinian was shot in the foot in July by an Israeli soldier  a moment captured by Salam Amira , a Palestinian schoolgirl , on her video camera .
" Israel says it wants to prevent the inhabitants of Nilin using the road so that it can  secured ’ , " said Sarit Michaeli of B’Tselem .
" In practice that means the road will be reserved for settlers to reach settlements even deeper in the West Bank , on the far side of Nilin .
The road will be for Jews only . "
In place of the checkpoint , Israel is proposing that Nilin be turned into an enclave connected via a tunnel to another road leading to Palestinian villages in the area .
The villagers fear they will then be entirely dependent on the Israeli army ’s good will to come and go .
Other communities in the West Bank have suffered similar fates in the past .
Qalqilya , home to 50,000 Palestinians , was tightly encircled by the wall a few years ago .
Its many farmers , who rely on the army to let them pass through gates to their land , complain bitterly of restrictions that have made it all but impossible to make a living .
They say that the soldiers often do not show up or they open the gate for only a few minutes a day .
Reports suggest that Qalqilya has seen an exodus of about one - tenth of its population since the wall ’s completion .
Like Qalqilya , Nilin is close to the Green Line , the West Bank ’s pre-1967 border with Israel .
It is in such areas that Israel ’s wall has made the biggest inroads into Palestinian land .
Ms Michaeli pointed out the plans for Nilin and similar developments elsewhere in the West Bank mean that any hope of a contiguous Palestinian state  the goal of the US - sponsored road map  is being destroyed by Israel .
" The army can open and close the tunnel at will , " she said .
" And we have seen how unaccountably the army uses that kind of power in other places in the West Bank .
If they want to punish the village or bring pressure to bear , they simply seal the tunnel . "
The tunnel is likely to be the final straw for Nilin ’s struggling economy .
According to a report from the World Bank published last month , increasingly severe movement restrictions across the West Bank are choking business prospects .
Palestinian gross domestic product has fallen by 40 per cent during the intifada and investment has dropped to " precariously low levels . "
The report further notes that the land left to Palestinian communities has been " fragmented into a multitude of enclaves , with a regime of movement restrictions between them . "
Salah Hawaja , who leads the nonviolence campaign against the barrier , said the villagers wished to avoid such a fate for Nilin .
" The wall is the first stage of turning us into a ghetto , " he said .
" The tunnel and the army ’s control of it will make the factories on which so many people in Nilin depend for their living unviable .
No one can run a business not knowing from day to day whether he will be able to send out trucks or bring in supplies .
" We have no choice but to resist because the other option is that we watch our economy being slowly strangled to death .
Israel wants us to leave this land for the settlers , but we are not going anywhere .
We will continue struggling for our right to stay here . "
This article originally appeared in The National , published in Abu Dhabi .
With the U.S. Senate recount still incomplete , attorneys on both sides have already armored up for the next pitched battle : over whether to reexamine thousands of rejected absentee ballots .
With Republican U.S. Sen .
Norm Coleman clinging to a reed - thin lead over DFL challenger Al Franken -- 180 votes as of Saturday night -- the issue of how and when absentee ballots should be counted has election law experts everywhere closely tracking the Minnesota recount drama .
In a race this tight , the difference could come down to clerical errors on absentee ballots or even a challenge of Minnesota 's law governing such ballots .
" Campaigns over the years have challenged anything and everything , " said recount expert Timothy Downs , principal author of " The Recount Primer " who has been involved in most major recounts over the years , including the biggest : Gore vs. Bush in 2000 .
Downs ' co-author , Chris Sautter , hit the ground in Minneapolis last week as part of Franken 's recount team .
On Wednesday , both sides will face off at a state Canvassing Board hearing that could prove momentous , with discussion and perhaps a ruling on whether rejected absentee ballots are in or out .
Despite the mounting number of challenges being made to the regular ballots being recounted now -- more than 1,900 as of Saturday evening , almost evenly divided between the campaigns -- experts say that most of those disputes will be easily resolved by the five - member board .
As a result , the challenges may in the end make only modest changes .
But if the Canvassing Board decides to review rejected absentee ballots , many still unexamined votes could get thrown into the mix , adding far more uncertainty .
" Ultimately , if the number of rejected ballots start to make a large enough stack , it can cast some cloud over the regularly recounted ballots , " said Edward Foley , who directs the election law center at Ohio State University 's Mortiz Law College .
Foley said the race has already taken enough twists and turns to merit its own chapter in his upcoming book on the history of disputed elections .
A Star Tribune analysis of rejected absentee ballot lists collected from 25 of the state 's 87 counties shows that 2,066 would - be absentee voters were excluded from initial vote tallies in just those counties .
The total does not include Hennepin County , home to about one quarter of the state 's population , or several other metro counties .
More ballots , more errors
The reasons for rejecting absentee ballots vary .
Many voters failed to fill out voter registration cards or to sign the backs of absentee envelopes , as required by law .
Those ballots , Downs and others say , could be dispensed with quickly at a review hearing .
But other situations could require careful scrutiny .
And the sheer volume of absentee ballots this year has changed the conventional wisdom on what role they could play .
More than 288,000 Minnesotans cast absentee ballots this year -- nearly one voter in 10 -- essentially turning the state 's absentee system into a type of early voting .
Once an alternative for the infirm , affluent snowbirds and travelers , absentee balloting this year became a key element of Democratic voter turnout strategy .
" We had lines out the door for absentee voting , " said Ramsey County Elections Manager Joe Mansky .
" The lines had blacks , whites , Hispanics , immigrants , young , old -- everything , " Mansky said .
With increased numbers come increased errors , both by voters and administrators , said elections expert Robert Stein , a political science professor at Rice University , in Texas .
Stein 's class on elections and voting behavior spent Friday monitoring Minnesota news sites , examining every twist and turn of a race that has given election junkies one last rush .
" I do n't mean to be disrespectful , " Stein said , " but it 's been a hoot to watch .
Everybody thought this was the kind of thing that would happen in Florida or Texas . "
In Washington state 's protracted 2004 gubernatorial race , a hand recount found 561 administrative errors on what had been rejected absentee ballots in a contest where the winner had led by 129 votes at one point .
" You 're down to less than two thousandths of a percent difference , " Stein said on Friday , when fewer than 150 votes separated Coleman from Franken .
" That 's infinitesimal . "
Board vs. court
The vast majority of rejected votes will stay rejected even on close examination , Downs said .
" But in a race that could come down to a handful of votes , if even a fraction are found eligible , that could affect the outcome . "
Downs cautioned that no one should be too sure who it would favor .
" There is no profile of an absentee voter that holds up anymore , " he said .
" It used to tilt Republican , but it 's changing so much it 's not predictive . "
The Franken campaign has argued vigorously that rejected ballots should be reexamined immediately by the Canvassing Board , going so far as to present affidavits from voters whose absentee ballots were n't counted .
Coleman recount attorney Fritz Knaak said the Coleman campaign is basing its objection on the fact that the current recount is an administrative process rather than a judicial one .
An administrative recount , he said , echoing an opinion issued by the attorney general last week , is designed under Minnesota law to reexamine ballots already counted , not to scrutinize decisions made about the eligibility of voters or validity of ballots .
Those questions , Knaak said , would properly be considered by a court in an election contest brought by voters or campaigns .
But Raleigh Levine , an election law professor at William Mitchell College of Law , said boards elsewhere have decided otherwise .
" There definitely are other jurisdictions in which defective absentee ballots are examined by the canvassing board , " Levine said .
In Massachusetts , she noted , registrars are instructed to reexamine rejected absentee ballots as part of the administrative recount .
Stein , of Rice University , said that ultimately , Minnesota 's contest is unlikely to be determined by anything as mundane as an administrative recount .
Thanksgiving is next week , and President Bush could make it a really special holiday by resigning .
Seriously .
We have an economy that ’s crashing and a vacuum at the top .
Bush  who is currently on a trip to Peru to meet with Asian leaders who no longer care what he thinks  has n’t got the clout , or possibly even the energy , to do anything useful .
His most recent contribution to resolving the fiscal crisis was lecturing representatives of the world ’s most important economies on the glories of free - market capitalism .
Putting Barack Obama in charge immediately is n’t impossible .
Dick Cheney , obviously , would have to quit as well as Bush .
In fact , just to be on the safe side , the vice president ought to turn in his resignation first .
( We ’re desperate , but not crazy . )
Then House Speaker Nancy Pelosi would become president until Jan. 20 .
Obviously , she ’d defer to her party ’s incoming chief executive , and Barack Obama could begin governing .
As a bonus , the Pelosi presidency would put a woman in the White House this year after all .
On the downside , a few right - wing talk - show hosts might succumb to apoplexy .
That would , of course , be terrible , but I ’m afraid we might have to take the risk in the name of a greater good .
Can I see a show of hands ?
How many people want George W. out and Barack in ?
A great many Americans have been counting the days all year on their 2008 George W. Bush Out of Office Countdown calendars .
I know a lot of this has been going on because so many people congratulated me when the Feb .

Bush quote turned out to be from one of my old columns .
( “ I think we need not only to eliminate the tollbooth from the middle class , I think we should knock down the tollbooth . ” )
Thursday , we posted this warning from Markos :
The GOP is desperate .
Expect the worst of the worst to start hitting here soon .
Jeremiah Wright is overdue for his second act , as well as Ayers , the Muslim crap , and anything else desperate Republicans can fabricate .
At this point , they literally have nothing to lose .
As expected , the negative onslaught is on its way .
This is round two for the McCain and his campaign .
They spent July , August and early September in attack mode — aided and abetted by smarmy tactics from State Republican parties and a slew of outside groups .
But , from here on out , it ’s going to be nothing but negative , That is already true of McCain t.v. ads , which TPM Election Central reported are “ Nearly 100 Percent Devoted To Attack Ads . ”
Today ’s Washington Post reports :
Sen .
John McCain and his Republican allies are readying a newly aggressive assault on Sen. Barack Obama ’s character , believing that to win in November they must shift the conversation back to questions about the Democrat ’s judgment , honesty and personal associations , several top Republicans said .
With just a month to go until Election Day , McCain ’s team has decided that its emphasis on the senator ’s biography as a war hero , experienced lawmaker and straight - talking maverick is insufficient to close a growing gap with Obama .
The Arizonan ’s campaign is also eager to move the conversation away from the economy , an issue that strongly favors Obama and has helped him to a lead in many recent polls .
“ We ’re going to get a little tougher , ” a senior Republican operative said , indicating that a fresh batch of television ads is coming .
“ We ’ve got to question this guy ’s associations .
Very soon .
There ’s no question that we have to change the subject here , ” said the operative , who was not authorized to discuss strategy and spoke on the condition of anonymity .
Change the subject .
Of course McCain wants “ to move the conversation away from the economy .
But , one thing Team McCain does n’t grasp is that just about every family in America is having a conversation about the economy .
This year , the American people are actually paying attention to issues .
But , McCain is banking on the idea that negative attack ads will make us all forget that the economy is on the brink of disaster .
We ’ve seen the Obama campaign get tougher and much sharper over the past few weeks .
The candidate himself is on a roll .
They ’re not going to set back and take McCain ’s attacks .
The new “ John McCain raised taxes 477 times ” ad , which John posted last night , is a good example .
None of us will take it this time .
We ’re all going to have to fight back — and we will .
John McCain already sold his soul to Karl Rove .
These next few weeks are going to define him forever .

Introduction
Last week , the all - knowing Mako inspired me to give zsh a shot .
He started me off with a .zshrc file , and now a week later , I ’ve been spreading the word to as many people as I can .
But let ’s rewind a bit .
First off , the basics : I expect most of you to be familiar with what a shell is .
A command - line shell is a user interface to the operating system .
For all practical purposes , you know it as “ the thing that you type commands into ” .
There are many , many shells to choose from , and most * nix ’es come with different default shells too .
Arguably , the most popular shell in use today is the GNU Bourne Again Shell , better known as bash .
The other main family of shells is known as the C shells ( csh , tcsh ) — named after their C - like scripting syntax .
So what ’s zsh and why would I want it over my current shell ?
The shell I am raving about today is the Z - shell , or zsh .
Zsh is an expansion on the Korn shell ( ksh ) , which is an expansion on bash .
( UPDATE :
The previous statement , as pointed out by a lot of readers , is incorrect .
ksh existed before bash , and if anything bash was inspired by ksh .
I was merely going by the feature lists and noticing that modern ksh is a lot more capable than bash , and thereby assuming this relationship .
I will leave the statement there because changing it might “ look bad ” ) .
It is one of the most full - featured shells you can ask for , and I would go as far as to say that everyone has something to gain from using zsh .
Particularly if you have stuck with bash or your operating system ’s default shell , I strongly recommend you give zsh a shot !
What do I like about it ?
Acts extremely similar to bash .
You can use zsh exactly the way you use bash and not learn a single thing , and even then it ’s an improvement !
Compatibility with familiar shells is very important .
Switching from bash to zsh is not going to be like switching from GEdit to vim .
You ’ll be instantly at home in that all your bash shortcuts / commands will work as expected , but you ’ll also have access to zsh ’s goodies .
If you ’re a shell scripting addict , you ’ll be pleased to know that zsh ’s scripting syntax is mostly backwards - compatible with bash , too .
Typo correction .
How many times have you typed something like aptg-et or other mangled commands ?
Well , if I do that in zsh , I get a message asking : “ zsh : correct ' aptg - et ' to ' apt - get ' [ nyae ] ? “ .
Magical , is n’t it ?
This autocorrect also applies to any parameters or paths or filenames you type .
Phenomenally intelligent tab completion .
Wait … I hear what you ’re saying already .
“ Duh you idiot , bash does this too !
You just need to uncomment / install bash - completion . ”
No , that ’s not what I mean .
Can your bash : Present suggestions in a menu that you can browse by arrow keys ?
Complete the kill command by showing a menu of all your processes ?
Complete the aptitude or ls commands by showing a menu of relevant parameters and a short description of what they do ?
In addition to exact matches , show also near matches in a separate section ?
Pop up completion options even for complex commands virtually instanteously , without bash ’s dreaded “ UH OH I should ’ve typed a few more letters first ! ” delay ?
If you could say yes to any of these questions , then please let me know !
Because after 3 years of using bash , my bash sure does n’t !
Share history across sessions .
Multiple simultaneously running zsh sessions can share history with each other , rather than clobbering each other up .
One of the most frustrating things to a bash user is typing in a long command , then searching for it again the next day via Ctrl+r , only to find it nowhere in the history .
Built in pager .
I ’m a lazy person .
And I think you are , too .
zsh comes with a pager directly in the shell .
This means you can type things like < README and it is equivalent to less README or cat README | less More powerful globbing .
Globbing is the fancy term for “ wildcards on steroids ” — your matching expressions like “ *. c ” or “ * Office * S03E [ 0 - 2 ] [ 0 - 9 ] *.avi ” and so on .
As the zsh introduction shows , zsh gives you way more powerful globbing expressions .
You ’ll rarely find yourself forced to whip out the find command or a GUI search tool .
More bearable scripting language .
If you ’re not a shell scripter , you probably will have no idea what I ’m talking , but all you shell scripters out there :
Say goodbye to all those bash gotchas .
How many times have you been bitten by a statement like [ $ FOO = $ BAR ] erroring out because FOO or BAR were empty , and then having to resort to silly tricks like [ x$ FOO = x$ BAR ] .
Well , zsh has rescued you with its double - bracked comparisons .
[ [ $ FOO = $ BAR ] ] will always work , and [ [ $ FOO && $ BAR ] ] comes a lot more naturally than [ $ FOO - a $ BAR ] .
I ca n’t even begin to scratch the surface of zsh ’s programming capabilities , but I encourage you to give it a shot !
A lot more .
Remember , I ’m a beginner too .
I have just hit the tip of the iceberg myself .
Consult zsh ’s wonderful documentation ( which I will link to later ) for everything you want to know about zsh .
Ok , You Convinced Me. How Do I Start Using zsh ?
Excellent !
Glad you decided to give it a chance .
Unfortunately , zsh wo n’t do everything I just raved about when you install it .
In fact , by default it ’s quite bland .
I recall two years ago , I heard some buzz about zsh , so I installed it and fired it up , and thought to my self “ WTF is this crappy thing ?
It does n’t even have tab completion !
I ’m going back to bash . ”
To get zsh to do magical things , you need to configure it by a file called .zshrc .
This is the analog of bash ’s . bashrc or csh ’s .cshrc ( which is , by the way , not a city in Bosnia ) .
The way most people begin populating this file is by googling for zshrc and using someone else ’s as an example .
Well , I ’ve got some of my own zshrc files too , which I based off Mako ’s and various googled zshrc files , so I do not in any way claim any credit to these creations .
So , let ’s get started :
Install zsh from your distribution .
You should consult your distribution ’s package manager ( yum , apt - get , Synaptic , Portage , fink , you know the drill ) because they most likely have it packaged .
There are generally two packages , a zsh and a zsh - devel or zsh - beta package .
The beta package is newer and contains new features and enhancements , but may have bugs .
I personally use the betas and have yet to have a problem , but this choice is up to you .
Both work great .
Grab a zshrc file .
You can either google - and - build one you like , or start from my sample ones : Linux : This is the standard one I use on my Linux machines .
I run Ubuntu but I did n’t put anything distro-specific in there .
Mac OS X : This is almost identical to the Linux one , except it fixes the behavior of the delete / pgup / pgdn / home / end keys and has a prompt color scheme for black text on white background display schemes ( because personally I find that looks better on my Macbook )
This file should be saved at ~/.zshrc ; that is , a file called “ .zshrc ” in your home directory .
Enjoy , read documentations , tweak to your heart ’s content !
Please , go to zsh ’s homepage and look around the documentation for more tips and tricks .
I ’m a newbie to zsh — I ca n’t teach you much about it because I ’m learning as we speak .

I ’m still contemplating that in my zshrc ! )
The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that it had discovered the toxic chemical melamine in infant formula made by an American manufacturer , raising the possibility that the problem was more extensive in the United States than previously thought .
While few details were available late Tuesday , agency officials said they had discovered melamine at trace levels in a single sample of infant formula .
It was also discovered in several samples of dietary supplements that are made by some of the same manufacturers who make formula .
F.D.A. officials insisted that the levels of melamine were so low that they did not pose a health threat .
“ There ’s no cause for concern or no risk from these levels , ” said Judy Leon , an agency spokeswoman .
Ms. Leon said the contamination was most likely the result of food contact with something like a can liner , or from some other manufacturing problems , but not from deliberate adulteration .

Myths about Vegetarianism MYTH : " Humans were designed to eat meat . "
Fact : Human anatomy suggests otherwise .
We 're designed to be able to eat meat occasionally , as a survival mechanism , but our digestive systems are very similar to those of the other plant - eaters and totally unlike those of carnivores .
Also , the less meat someone eats , the less their risk of just about every major disease .
Finally , people who do n't eat meat have better physical performance , whether they 're athletes or not .
The argument that humans are carnivores because we possess " canine " teeth ignores the facts that other plant - eaters have these same so - called canine teeth , and that only plant - eaters have molar teeth .

MYTH : " Vegetarians get little protein . "
Fact : Plant foods offer abundant protein .
Vegetables are around 23 % protein on average , beans 28 % , grains 13 % , and even fruit has 5.5 % .
For comparison , human breast milk is only 6 % ( designed for the time in our lives when our protein needs are as high as they 'll ever be ) .
Professional recommendations for adults range from 2.5 % to 10 % , and plant foods supply that easily .

MYTH : " Beans are a good source of protein . "
Fact :
There is no such thing as a special " source of protein " because all foods -- even plants -- have plentiful protein .
You might as well say " Food is a good source of protein " .
In any event , beans ( 28 % ) do n't average much more protein per calorie than common vegetables ( 23 % ) .

MYTH : " Meat protein is better than plant protein .
You have to combine plant foods to make the protein just as good . "
Fact :
This myth was popularized in the 1971 book Diet for a Small Planet and has no basis in fact .
The author of the book admitted nearly thirty years ago that she made a mistake ( in the 1982 edition of the same book ) .

MYTH : " Vegetable oils are healthy . "
Fact : Dr. John McDougall says : " Sadly , the myth that vegetable oil is health food is n't true … choosing between dropping some butter or pouring some olive oil into your frying pan is , nutritionally speaking , like choosing whether you want to be shot or hanged .
Here 's why .
All fats -- saturated and unsaturated -- are involved in the growth of certain kinds of cancer cells .
Scientific research …has consistently shown that a higher consumption of fats will produce a higher incidence of cancer .
What 's worse , the unsaturated fats in such highly touted vegetable oils as corn oil , safflower oil , and olive oil , and the margarines made from them , are the fats that most promote the growth of cancer .
They 're much better at this double - crossing deal than are the saturated fats that are so bad for your arteries and heart . " -- The McDougall Program ; 1990 ; John A. McDougall , M.D. ; p. 41 - 42 .
McDougall goes on to explain that fatty foods ( including vegetable oils and tofu ) kill your energy level by making your blood cells stick together in clumps , can make the skin and hair oily , and are extremely fattening .
MYTH : " Tofu is a low - fat food . "
Fact : Tofu is 54 % fat , more than many meats , and way more than the 10 - 20 % of dietary calories from fat that most vegetarian authorities recommend .
McDougall again : " [ Soybeans ] contain far too much fat for regular use by most people …
Tofu …is even a little worse …
Obviously , tofu is a rich , high - fat , low - fiber food that should be used sparingly . "
MYTH : " Milk is necessary for strong bones . "
Fact : McDougall : " Where does a cow or an elephant get the calcium needed to grow its huge bones ?
From plants , of course .
Only plants .
…
People in Asia and Africa who consume no milk products after they 're weaned from their mother 's breast grow perfectly healthy skeletons in the normal size for their race .
A consistent conclusion published in the scientific literature is clear : Calcium deficiency of dietary origin is unknown in humans .
Dairy products contain large amounts of animal proteins .
This excess protein removes calcium from the body by way of the kidneys .
Knowing the physiological effects on calcium metabolism of eating excess protein explains why societies with the highest intakes of meat and dairy products -- the United States , England , Israel , Finland , and Sweden - - also show the highest rates of osteoporosis , the disease of bone - thinning . "
MYTH : " Carbs make you fat . "
Fact :
Not the carbs found in fruits and vegetables .
Refined carbs , like sugar and flour , can make you fat , because they 're calorically dense .
Fruits and veggies do n't have that problem .
You can lose weight even while eating copious amounts of potatoes ( as I have ) .
Dr. McDougall has run a health clinic for 25 years where his patients lose weight while eating unlimited amounts of buffet - style meals centered on starches like potatoes .
Carbs do n't make you fat , calorically - dense foods do .
These include sugar , flour , oil , milk , and meat .
MYTH : " Hitler was a vegetarian . "
Fact : No , he was n't .
Not in the traditional sense of the word , anyway .
Hitler occasionally reduced his meat consumption on doctor 's orders because of digestive problems , but he frequently cheated .
If you want to call that vegetarianism , you might as well say that all meat - eaters are vegetarian for the eight hours they 're asleep each not and not eating meat .
Of course , educated people will understand that it 's irrelevant that Hitler was vegetarian , but some non-vegetarians delight in repeating this myth as though they 've made some sort of point .

UPDATE :
Birth Center to Remain Open , but with Remote Monitoring and Lost Accreditation
Community Challenges Hospital to Do Better
Thanks to the efforts of the Campaign to Save the North Shore Birth Center , on December 15 , 2008 , the Board of Trustees of the Northeast Health Corporation voted against the proposed closure of the North Shore Birth Center ( NSBC ) .
However , as conditions of its continued operation , patients will no longer be permitted to receive the handheld , Doppler - based fetal monitoring that was previously in use at NSBC in accordance with national birth center accreditation guidelines .
Instead , despite their low - risk pregnancies , all NSBC patients will be subjected to remote electronic fetal monitoring ( EFM ) , a practice that leading medical journals agree is ineffective and frequently harmful .
Remote EFM will also result in a loss of NSBC ’s accreditation by the Commission for the Accreditation of Birth Centers ( CABC ) .
CABC accreditation is a strong indicator of exceptional quality of care , because it ensures the use of practices proven to be safe and effective in a birth center environment .
On December 18 , 2008 , six representatives of the Campaign to Save the North Shore Birth Center–Nicole Aliberte , Mira Clark , Rebecca Hains , Amy Kreydin , Sarah Shamel , and Christa Terry–met with Dr. Henry Ramini , President and CEO of Northeast Health System , and three other hospital administrators .
This meeting had been rescheduled by hospital officials twice , with the result that it did not take place until after the Trustees ’ December 15 vote .
At the meeting , Ramini unveiled to Campaign representatives details of the plan to change fetal monitoring practices .
These details are highly problematic and deeply troubling to members of the Campaign .
Ramini explained that by the end of March 2009 , patients will be monitored electronically for 20 minutes to establish a baseline upon arrival at the birth center .
Subsequently , every 30 minutes , another 5 - to 10 - minute electronic monitoring session will occur .
This electronic monitoring will be “ continuously transmitted to the hospital , ” where it will be remotely monitored by two hospital personnel .
Without even observing the patient in question , and despite the well - documented problems of misdiagnosis via electronic fetal monitoring , those personnel — NOT the midwives — will decide whether the patient should be transferred into the hospital .
Ramini added that , in the case of a disagreement , these two “ monitors ” would be able to override the midwives ’ professional judgment , with a preference toward “ erring on the side of overtreating the patient . ”
Furthermore , when asked whether patients would be able to opt out of electronic fetal monitoring at the birth center , Dr. Ramini said no , citing fears that if refusal were permitted , all patients would opt out .
However , informed refusal is a basic patient right in the state of Massachusetts and a civil right guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution , which protects patients from being subjected to medical procedures without their consent .
The Campaign to Save the North Shore Birth Center decries the hospital ’s legally invalid plan to routinely violate patients ’ rights .
When Campaign representatives at the meeting cited respected medical studies and reports that detail the unreliability and risks of using electronic fetal monitoring , Ramini said that he “ does n’t know if it ’s good or bad for patients , ” but that hospital lawyers advise its use purely for legal reasons , so that the hospital could use the monitor printout in case of a lawsuit .
The Campaign representatives provided Ramini with a large binder of evidence - based studies from established medical journals and offered a summary of key points .
The evidence we presented details that electronic fetal monitoring is an unacceptable medical practice for low - risk patients , because it often leads to unnecessary and dangerous interventions .
We also offered that electronic fetal monitoring can be used — and has been used , frequently and successfully — against hospitals in lawsuits , making them no less vulnerable to litigation .
The attitude of the Beverly Hospital representatives was essentially this :
Our minds are made up .
Do n’t confuse us with the facts .
The Campaign to Save the North Shore Birth Center rejects the hospital ’s plan to use remote fetal monitoring .
The proposed EFM plans prioritize the hospital lawyers ’ exaggerated straw - man fears of a lawsuit over maternal and fetal health and the legal rights of women to accept or reject this questionable intervention .
The Campaign to Save the North Shore Birth Center demands that hospital officials allow the North Shore Birth Center to continue practicing well - established evidence - based care , including the continued practice of bedside , non-remote fetal monitoring by a handheld doppler monitor , which is widely used state - of - the - art equipment .
Our stance may be summarized thus :
1 . To subject women and their babies to a form of fetal monitoring known to unnecessarily increase the c-section rate , when a more effective and safer form of fetal monitoring is already in place , is unacceptable .
2 . To have medical personnel who are in a separate building hundreds of yards away determine the fate of low - risk women and their healthy babies , overriding the professional judgment of our midwives , is unacceptable .
3 . To prioritize legal fears over maternal and fetal health is unacceptable .
4. To violate basic Massachusetts ’ patient rights and constitutional rights regarding informed consent and informed refusal is unacceptable .
5 . To institute a practice that will cause NSBC , which has held the gold standard of CABC accreditation for years , to lose its accreditation is unacceptable .
HELP US SAVE NSBC !
Here ’s what you can do to help save the North Shore Birth Center and its clients from the dangerous and unethical new protocols planned by the hospital :
1. Write letters to Beverly Hospital administrators and its Board of Trustees speaking out against these plans .
In our meeting with administrators on December 18 , they suggested that members of the community would not be troubled by these plans .
They said there has been a change in the culture regarding what patients want , and that because of this context , changes to birth center ’s long - standing practices would be acceptable to the community .
Let ’s flood them with letters again , sending the clear message that they ’re wrong !
In addition to the trustees ( whose contact information is available here ) , please copy your letters to the administrators who attended the December 18 meeting : Dr. Henry Ramini , President and CEO ; Chip Peyson , Vice President of External Affairs ; Pauline Pike , Chief Operating Officer ; and Heather Jones , Director of Community and Public Relations .
2 . Send letters to the editor of your local and regional newspapers .
Let them know about the Campaign ’s continuance and the reasons why we have to keep fighting .
In writing your letters , note that the hospital ’s December 15 statement to the media made it sound as though the practice of fetal monitoring would be new to the birth center .
( It stated : “ The Board recognizes the national trend of birth center closings due to rising costs and has decided to take a proactive approach and modify how care will be delivered at the Birth Center .
Patients delivering at the Birth Center will now receive fetal monitoring during their delivery . ” )
News articles appearing on this topic have presented this misleading statement as fact .
Correct them :
Let the media know that fetal monitoring was already in use at the birth center — appropriate bedside fetal monitoring with a handheld Doppler , which , in fact , you most likely experienced at your own NSBC birth — and that you prefer this safer , handheld fetal monitor to the remote electronic fetal monitor that the hospital is forcing NSBC to use , beginning this spring .
Useful tips for writing successful letters to the editor are available here .
3. Contact your legislators , both local and state .
Let them know that Beverly Hospital is planning to violate your rights as a patient in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts by denying you informed consent and informed refusal if you give birth at the birth center !
Ask them to intervene in any way possible .
Make sure you point out that birth center services using only handheld monitors are far less expensive than hospital services using costly and unnecessary technology .
This hospital will have to find the money to pay for these new remote monitors somehow .
The extra , unnecessary personnel supervising NSBC births from a separate building will increase costs , as well .
Should Massachusetts ’ new health plan be further strained by higher costs such as these ?
Tips for locating and writing to your legislators may be found here .
4 . Keep your focus where it belongs , on safety .
Our interest in maintaining birth center accreditation and appropriate monitoring methods is not because we merely want a “ nice experience ” at the birth center .
Hospital representatives at the December 18 meeting strongly implied that all the Campaign really cared about was the low - tech , gentler “ experience ” of birth center birth .
This paternalistic , condescending attitude has misread the basis for our concerns and could n’t be more wrong .
We are intelligent , educated women who understand the difference between real evidence - based safey measure and the hospital ’s defensive use of expensive and self - serving unnecessary interventions .
Together , we ’ve already won a major battle in the fight to save our birth center .
Let ’s not stop now–let ’s win a reversal of the hospital ’s plans to require remote fetal monitoring and violate patients ’ rights !

( CNN ) --
A jury awarded $ 2.5 million in damages on Friday to a Kentucky teenager who was severely beaten by members of a Ku Klux Klan group because the Klansmen mistakenly thought he was an illegal Latino immigrant , the Southern Poverty Law Center said .
Jordan Gruver , then 16 , was targeted and beaten by Klan members , his lawsuit alleged .
The jury found that the Imperial Klans of America and its founder wrongfully targeted 16 - year - old Jordan Gruver , an American citizen of Panamanian and Native - American descent .
The verdict included $ 1.5 million in compensatory damages and $ 1 million in punitive damages against " Imperial Wizard " Ron Edwards .
The law center said before the verdict that a large damage award could break the Klan group , allowing the teen and the law center to seize the group 's assets , including its headquarters , a 15 - acre compound in Dawson Springs , Kentucky .
" We look forward to collecting every dime that we can for our client and to putting the Imperial Klans of America out of business , " said law center founder and chief trial attorney Morris Dees , who tried the case .
Gruver , backed by the law center , filed the personal injury lawsuit last year seeking up to $ 6 million in damages from the Imperial Klans of America and two of its leaders -- Edwards and " Grand Titan " Jarred R. Hensley .
An all - white jury of seven men and seven women deliberated for five hours after three days of testimony .
The suit alleged that Edwards , Hensley , and the Imperial Klans of America as a whole incited its members to use violence against minorities .
" The people of Meade County , Kentucky , have spoken loudly and clearly .
And what they 've said is that ethnic violence has no place in our society , that those who promote hate and violence will be held accountable and made to pay a steep price , " Dees said .
According to testimony , three members of the Klan group confronted Gruver in July 2006 during a recruiting mission at the Meade County Fair in Brandenberg , Kentucky .
They taunted him with ethnic slurs -- inaccurate ones -- spat on him and doused him with alcohol .
Two of the men , including Hensley , knocked Gruver to the ground and repeatedly struck and kicked him .
Ku Klux Klan Founded as violent white supremacist movement by Confederate officers after the Civil War , lasted until the 1870s
Klan began again in 1915 , still active today
Most recent surge of activity came during civil rights movement of 1960s
Membership exceeded 4 million in 1920s ; now a few thousand members in splinter groups Source : Encyclopaedia Britannica Source : Encyclopaedia Britannica
" All I could see was a bunch of feet , " Gruver , now 19 , told the jury .
" As they were kicking me , I prayed to myself .
I said , ' God , just please let me go .
Please let me make it home . ' "
When the blows stopped , Gruver had a broken jaw , broken left forearm , two cracked ribs and cuts and bruises .
He testified that he has suffered permanent nerve damage and psychological trauma .
He does n't leave his house and rarely sleeps more than two hours at a time because he has nightmares , CNN affiliate WLKY reported .
Among the evidence the jury saw was a pair of red-laced , steel - toed boots .
A police witness testified that Hensley wore the boots the night he and another Klansman attacked Gruver .
Edwards acknowledged from the witness stand that the boots were the " weapon of choice " for skinheads and that the red laces carried special significance -- that " someone should shed blood for their race . "
Also revealed during testimony : An alleged Klan plot to kill Dees , the law center 's attorney .
Former Klansman Kale Kelly , once a member of Edwards ' inner circle , testified he was told to kill Dees because of the center 's lawsuit in Idaho against the Aryan Nations , a neo -Nazi supremacist organization .
The plot was thwarted by the FBI in 1999 , according to testimony .
Kelly , who since has left the group , cried on the witness stand during his testimony .
Other former Klansmen also testified that they were encouraged to use violence .
One said he was conditioned to kill .
Watch the former Klansmen testify »
Gruver 's assailants already have gone through the criminal courts , striking plea bargains and serving time in the Kentucky state prison system , according to court documents .
The case was not treated as a hate crime .
Dees alleged that on the night in question -- July 29 and 30 , 2006 -- Edwards " sent his agents out on a mission . "
During that mission , which included recruiting and distributing Klan literature at the fair , Gruver was beaten because the men mistakenly believed he was an illegal immigrant .
Edwards , who represented himself , told the jury he had nothing to do with the attack .
" I stay within the law .
I do n't break the law , " he said .
At an earlier court deposition , Edwards demonstrated his contempt for the law center and its lawsuit by tattooing a profane reference to it on his freshly shaved head .
On its Web site , the Imperial Klans of America refers to itself as a Christian organization exercising its rights of free speech and assembly under the U.S. Constitution .
The site carries this proviso : " If you are not of the White race , this Web site is not for the likes of YOU ! "
It then goes on to name the races and ethnicities it " hates , " adding , " This is our God - given right . "
The Web site disavows violence or any kind of criminal activity .
Edwards lives in a trailer on the Klan group 's heavily guarded , gated compound in rural Dawson Springs .
The compound is the site of the Klan 's annual white power rally and music festival , know as " Nordic Fest , " according to the suit .
It was at the compound , the suit alleges , that the Klan group incited its members to use violence against minorities .
The Klan seems to thrive during times of political and financial turmoil , according to organizations that monitor its activities .
The first incarnation of the Ku Klux Klan was founded by a group of Confederate generals at the end of the Civil War to promote a white supremacist agenda .
The Klan was driven underground , but re-formed after World War I. Klan activity increased during the civil rights movement of the 1960s , and has surged again since 2006 as a result of opposition to gay marriage and immigration .
There is no single , centralized Ku Klux Klan .
The Southern Poverty Law Center says the Imperial Klans of America is the second largest KKK group after the Brotherhood of Klans Knights , based in Marion , Ohio .
Booth Gunter , the law center 's spokesman , said there are 34 named Klan organizations across the country , with 155 separate chapters .
The Anti-Defamation League estimates there are more than 40 different Klan groups , with as many as 5,000 members in more than 100 chapters , or " klaverns , " across the country .
It is not the first time the Southern Poverty Law Center has taken a supremacist group to court and won .
In 2000 , for example , the law center won a $ 6.3 million jury verdict that forced Aryan Nations leader Richard Butler to give up the group 's Idaho compound .
In 1987 , a $ 7 million verdict in Mobile , Alabama , targeted the United Klans of America .

OSLO ( Reuters ) - Greenhouse gas emissions in many industrialised nations are still rising , especially in the former Soviet bloc , despite agreements to cut back , the U.N. Climate Change Secretariat said on Monday .
Emissions by 40 industrialized nations grew by 2.3 percent to the equivalent of 18.0 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide in 2006 from 17.6 billion in 2000 , it said .
They dipped 0.1 percent in 2006 compared with 2005 but underlying trends were still up .
“ Greenhouse gas emissions in industrialized countries continue to rise , ” the Secretariat said of the 2000 - 06 trend , in a statement on its annual official compilation of data used to assess compliance with U.N. treaties .
It said the biggest recent gains were by nations of the former Soviet bloc , whose emissions had risen 7.4 percent since 2000 to 3.7 billion tonnes after crashing in the early 1990s with the collapse of former smokestack industries .
It said the rising trends showed the need for the world ’s environment ministers to make progress on a new U.N. climate treaty , due to be agreed by the end of next year , at talks in Poznan , Poland , from December 1 to 12 .
“ The figures clearly underscore the urgency for the U.N. negotiating process to make good progress in Poznan and move forward quickly in designing a new agreement to respond to the challenge of climate change , ” said Yvo de Boer , head of the Secretariat .
The U.N. Climate Panel says global emissions should peak by 2015 and then fall , to avoid the worst of climate change that could bring water and food shortages by causing floods , heatwaves and more powerful storms .
U.S. DECLINE
The 2006 dip of 0.1 percent from 2005 was caused mainly by a fall in U.S. emissions to 7.0 billion tonnes from 7.1 billion tonnes in 2005 , helped by factors including rising oil prices and a mild winter that cut demand for heating .
A Reuters compilation of national data in September also showed that decline .
President George W. Bush , who has kept the United States out of the U.N. ’s Kyoto Protocol for curbing emissions , projects that U.S. emissions will peak only in 2025 .
President - elect Barack Obama wants far tougher action that would cut emissions by 80 percent from 1990 levels by 2050 .
He plans investments in a clean energy economy of up to $ 150 billion over 10 years .
Monday ’s data only covers industrialized nations -- developing nations face no obligation to cut or even report annual emissions .
Despite the rising trend since 2000 , emissions were down 4.7 percent from 1990 levels of 18.9 billion tonnes , caused mainly by the 1991 collapse of the Soviet Union .
Kyoto calls for average cuts of at least 5 percent below 1990 levels by 2008 - 12 .
Monday ’s report did not consider how far the 2008 global economic slowdown may affect emissions , which have grown worldwide by 70 percent since the 1970s .

Instead sensors and alarms will be used to guard the ships , with the ultimate aim being to do away with the need for any people at all .
Navy chiefs say the drastic measures are part of a plan to combat recruitment problems by creating a more family - friendly environment .
All local commanders have also been ordered to allow personnel affected by the ABC Learning child - care crisis more flexible working arrangements - and to work from home if necessary - until they have found alternative care .
Defence , like most of the public service , relies on ABC Learning for child - care services for its workers .
Hundreds of children of navy personnel have been affected by the collapse of the child - care giant .
Navy chiefs , in a communication to all local commanders , directed that " following the announcement that ABC child care has gone into receivership " , they must be " understanding of this stressful situation as the new working year approaches " .
" Local commanders are to make every effort to negotiate flexible working arrangements that allow families to manage their commitments at home and at work until the situation is resolved , " the directive says .
The stand - down period will run from December 3 to February 3 , and will be a permanent arrangement every year .
This Christmas 500 navy personnel will remain deployed overseas and in waters north of Australia .
If an emergency occurs , other personnel will be ordered back to work .
But thousands of sailors who might previously have been deployed on ships over December and January on exercises or training activities will not be this year , and will be able to take longer than usual holidays .
The extraordinary measures are a part of an initiative called " New Generation Navy " aimed at attracting and retaining more staff by changing the culture of the navy and improving the work - life balance of personnel .
The navy loses 11 per cent of its workforce every year and last financial year only achieved 73 per cent of its full - time recruitment targets .
The Chief of Navy , Vice Admiral Russ Crane , told the Herald " this program is about , where I can , providing an opportunity for our people to have a good break .
" This is about generating some space and taking advantage of an opportunity for [ personnel ] to be able to have a bit of time to spend with their families at home , a bit of time to spend with their mates . "
He added : " It 's about getting a culture in place that 's about working smarter not harder , and I think we owe that to our people .
" By doing that I believe we can significantly reduce some of the separation rates we 're seeing at the moment . "
Leading Seaman Christine van Lieshout is a mother of three whose husband is also in the navy .
She believes the new Christmas arrangements will be " fantastic " .
A reservist at navy headquarters at Russell in Canberra , Leading Seaman van Lieshout recalls spending Christmas in 2003 alone with her children because her husband , a chief petty officer , was on deployment to Christmas Island .
" That was pretty horrible , " she said .
" We were basically watching everyone else with their families … we received a phone call late in the afternoon from him and that was Christmas . "
This year Leading Seaman van Lieshout and her husband , Rodney , will both go on leave on December 19 , and will spend the holidays with their children Daniel , 16 , Ashley , 11 , and Stephanie , 13 .
Her husband has just returned from a six - month deployment in the Gulf , during which time he missed his children 's birthdays , Father 's Day and a confirmation .
" The children have not had an opportunity to see their dad very much , so having the opportunity to have Rodney home a lot longer is fantastic because it gives them bonding time and takes a bit of pressure off me . "
She said the initiatives were " fantastic for a lot of people " .

Here ’s a puzzle :
You and Bob are going to play a game which has the following steps .
Bob thinks of some function ( it ’s arbitrary : it does n’t have to be continuous or anything ) .
You pick an .
Bob reveals to you the table of values of his function on every input except the one you specified
You guess the value of Bob ’s secret function on the number that you picked in step 2 .
You win if you guess right , you lose if you guess wrong .
What ’s the best strategy you have ?
This initially seems completely hopeless : the values of on inputs have nothing to do with the value of on input , so how could you do any better then just making a wild guess ?
In fact , it turns out that if you , say , choose in Step 2 with uniform probability from , the axiom of choice implies that you have a strategy such that , whatever Bob picked , you will win the game with probability 1 !
The strategy is as follows :
Let be the equivalence relation on functions from to defined by iff for all but finitely many , .
Using the axiom of choice , pick a representative from each equivalence class .
In Step 2 , choose with uniform probability from .
When , in step 3 , Bob reveals , you know what equivalence class is in , because you know its values at all but one point .
Let be the representative of that equivalence class that you picked ahead of time .
Now , in step 4 , guess that is equal to .
What is the probability of success of this strategy ?
Well , whatever that Bob picks , the representative of its equivalence class will differ from it in only finitely many places .
You will win the game if , in Step 2 , you pick any number besides one of those finitely many numbers .
Thus , you win with probability 1 no matter what function Bob selects .
This puzzle originally had the following form :
Suppose that there are countably infinitely many prisoners : Prisoner 1 , Prisoner 2 , etc. , arranged so that Prisoner can see Prisoner iff .
A warden puts either a red hat or a blue hat on each prisoner ’s head , and asks each to guess the color of the hat on his own head .
Prove that the prisoners have a strategy of coordinating their guesses so that only finitely many of them will be wrong .
As before , let be the equivalence relation on functions defined by iff and differ on only finitely many places .
The prisoners ’ strategy will then be : Beforehand , pick a representative from each equivalence class .
Let be the color of the hat on Prisoner ‘s head .
Then , since each Prisoner can see the color of the hats on Prisoner for , each prisoner knows which equivalence class is in .
Suppose is the representative that they picked beforehand .
Then , for each , Prisoner will guess that he ’s wearing hat , and since , only finitely many of them will be wrong .
For some interesting comments on this puzzle , see Greg Muller ’s blog post on it here and Chris Hardin and Alan Taylor ’s paper An Introduction to Infinite Hat Problems .
After hearing this puzzle , Chris Hardin came up with a great generalization .
Instead of having a Prisoner for each and declare that Prisoner can see Prisoner iff , let be an arbitrary partial order and declare that for each , there is a Prisoner , and that Prisoner can see Prisoner iff .
Assuming again that red and blue hats are placed on all prisoners and that they must all guess the color of the hat on their own head , how many of them will be able to guess correctly ?
Call a partially ordered set reverse well - founded if there are no strictly increasing chains in it .
Chris Hardin and Alan Taylor showed in their paper A Peculiar Connection Between the Axiom of Choice and Predicting the Future that the prisoners have a strategy so that the set of prisoners who are wrong will be reverse well - founded .
In the case of the original prisoners problem , this implies that there will be only finitely many prisoners who are wrong , since there are no infinite reverse well - founded subsets of .
Suppose that there is a Prisoner for each and that Prisoner can see Prisoner iff .
Then , since all reverse well - founded subsets of are countable , at most countably many prisoners will be wrong under the Hardin - Taylor strategy .
Since all countable subsets of are measure zero , this gives another way to win the game against Bob with probability one .
In fact , it implies that you can do more :
You do n’t need Bob to tell you , just .
Hardin and Taylor express this by imagining that we represent the weather with respect to time as an arbitrary function .
Then , given that we can observe the past , there is an almost perfect weatherman who can predict the current weather with probability 1 .
They further show that the weatherman can almost surely get the weather right for some interval into the future .
What is the Hardin - Taylor strategy ?
What the prisoners do is that they first choose a well - ordering of the set of functions from to ( this uses the axiom of choice ) , and then for each , Prisoner simply guesses that his hat color is , where is the - least function consistent with what Prisoner sees .
Now , suppose that there is a sequence of prisoners who are wrong .
Since each Prisoner sees all the prisoners that Prisoner for sees , we must have that .
In fact , since for ( since by assumption Prisoner was wrong about his hat color , whereas Prisoner will be right about it , since he can see Prisoner ) , we have that , but this contradicts the fact that is a well - ordering .
Franken Gains in First Day of Counting , Media Play Fast and Loose with Numbers , GOP Prepares for the Worst ...
Brad Friedman Byon
11/19/2008 , 11:12 pm PT
We 've predicted since Election Day that Al Franken 's chances of winning the U.S. Senate seat in Minnesota are excellent .
News tonight , out of the state where a manual count of the paper ballots began today , may already be bearing out that prediction , though it 's far too early to know for sure .
Franken , so far , has gained about 30 votes on the incumbent Sen .
Norm Coleman on the first day of counting , bring the gap between the two to just 172 votes .
The race was previously determined , by the faulty and easily manipulated ES&S and Diebold ballot - scanning machines initially used to tabulate the paper ballots , to have given an edge of little more than 200 votes in favor of Coleman , out of nearly 3 million ballots cast .
That has n't stopped Coleman from desperately and prematurely declaring " victory " --- hey , it worked for Dubya in 2000 , and he was able to successfully take that to the Supreme Court , after all !
--- nor has it kept the GOP conspiracy theorists and potential sore - losers from declaring all manner of unsubstantiated claims of " fraud " and attempts to " steal the election . "
But as the hand count moves slowly forward --- and as I may be " off the grid , " or otherwise unable to keep up with every beat as quickly as usual over the next several weeks ---
I 'd ask that you folks keep a very close eye on a very important point likely to reveal itself ( to those who pay attention ) during this count ...
Back during the election contest hand - counts following this year 's New Hampshire Primary , officials in the state carried off some misleading sleight - of - hand that the mainstream corporate media were all too happy ( and lazy ) to report repeat to readers .
The scam worked like this :
If two precincts , for example , were hand - counted and in one it was found that Hillary Clinton actually had 10 more votes than the Diebold machines originally reported , and in the other Barrack Obama was found to have had 11 more votes than originally reported , state officials ( and the lazy media ) would report that : " Today 's recount found little change in the results , with Barrack Obama picking up just a single vote against Hillary Clinton . "
In truth , 21 votes had been miscounted in that scenario , but to officials and the public , it would become a nearly perfect count , off by only a single vote .
Had Obama gained 10 instead of 11 in that scenario , the media would have said " the hand count has revealed no errors from the original machine count . "
Misleading and deceptive ?
Of course .
Please watch for that happening in MN .
The machine miscounts in NH revealed , even in the limited number of ballots hand - counted there , an enormous error- rate , well in excess of that allowable by federal law .
But it was downplayed because some of the miscounts " evened each other out " and because states have a great self - interest in making their election systems look as good as possible to the public , no matter how bad they may be .
You can help counter that nonsense , if you pay close attention .
Today 's numbers ...
" The scoreboard reads 0 - 0 with 2.9 million to go , " Franken attorney Marc Elias correctly noted before today 's hand - count began .
" We do not know the winner ... until the completion of the process , " said MN's Sec. of State Mark Ritchie .
They were both correct , unlike Coleman , who had already declared victory .
" The only person who has declared Norm Coleman the winner of anything is Norm Coleman , " Franken spokesman Andy Barr noted , as reported in MinnPost.com 's excellent coverage of today 's proceedings .
The Minnesota Independent reported tonight 's results , noting Franken 's gains , after the first day of counting :
Al Franken closed his vote count gap with incumbent Norm Coleman to 172 on Wednesday , the first day of Minnesota ’s statewide U.S. Senate election recount .
Both candidates lost votes as officials recounted by hand slightly more than 15 percent of 2.9 million ballots cast — but Coleman lost 70 and Franken only 27 .
As mentioned above , the numbers " lost " by both candidates is somewhat misleading , e.g. , the Independent went on to report that " Hennepin County ’s manual recount of barely more than 1 percent of ballots cast had Coleman losing seven votes and Franken gaining one . "
In truth , a quick look tonight at the tiny number of ballots counted in Hennepin today show that Coleman actually lost seven votes , while Franken gained two but lost one from the original machine tally :
That 's a very minor example of what I was mentioning above , on a very small number of ballots , but you get the idea .
I can't comb through the numbers right now to search for more egregious examples , but I welcome you to do so .
Each day 's manual count numbers will be available after 8 pm CT via this link .
The Fraud Fraudsters ...
Finally , tonight , by way of preempting the cries of " voter fraud " that will come from the GOP when / if their man falls behind in the count ( they are already making such cries , but expect them to become increasingly louder and even more obnoxious ) , the Star - Tribune offers an excellent editorial today that begins this way :
Accusations about improper election procedures have been hurled with abandon by combatants in Minnesota ’s U.S. Senate battle , which enters its recount phase today .
But it ’s worth noting that neither the Al Franken nor Norm Coleman camps has accused election officials of allowing significant numbers of ineligible people to vote .
The two campaigns ’ close scrutiny of events on Nov. 4 apparently has found nothing notably defective in either the voter registration or sign - in that occurred at the polls .
That ’s the way it has been in every election since Minnesota began allowing voters to register at the polls in 1973 .
Ramsey County elections manager Joe Mansky said that , in his 24 years as a state and county elections administrator , the number of cases of orchestrated group efforts to subvert the law by registering improperly or voting multiple times has been “ exactly zero . ”
Imagine that , voters get to register at the polls on Election Day and there are " exactly zero " examples of improprieties .
By all means , let 's not do that in the rest of the country any time soon !
Bill Clinton used Fleetwood Mac's " Do n't Stop " as his theme for the 1992 presidential campaign .
If reports of strife between Sarah Palin and the McCain campaign hold water , then the Alaska Governor might want to tap into Fleetwood Mac 's library as well ( assuming she would n't get sued , which is a big assumption ) .
Her campaign song ?
" Go Your Own Way . "
As most polls show Barack Obama pulling away from John McCain , there are rumblings and perhaps signs that Palin is pulling away as well .
They 're not my staff
No , it does n't appear that the Republican vice presidential candidate has any problems with McCain himself .
But there are indications that she does n't necessarily like his staff or has any future intention of following them .
Perhaps she gave up on following them earlier .
Aides to McCain cite recent examples where Palin took things into her own hands .
In Colorado last week , she insisted on talking to reporters on a tarmac despite attempts by Palin staff to shut down the conversation .
She also denounced McCain robo-calls .
Before that , she was outspoken about her disappointment with the campaign decision to pull out of Michigan .
I 'm done with 'em
Supporters of Palin say she 's had it with the campaign staff .
" She 's lost confidence in most of the people on the [ campaign ] plane , " a Palin insider told Politico .
He says she would like to further ignore staff advice and do things her own way .
But CNN reports campaign aides say she 's a selfish renegade .
" She is a diva .
She takes no advice from anyone , " said this McCain adviser .
" She does not have any relationships of trust with any of us , her family , or anyone else . "
Bad introduction
Palin has let it be known that she 's not happy with the way she was introduced to the public following her speech at the Republican National Convention .
Her supporters say the real Sarah Palin is the one who electrified the crowd that night in early September .
Yes , she had a teleprompter at that event .
But they say she 's a natural and if she was able to interact with the media from the beginning instead of being quarantined from the press for nearly three weeks , the results would have been different .
Perhaps this is true .
The New York Times has a detailed story this morning that could back that -- or at least demonstrate that McCain aides were impressed with how she handled questions even on issues she was unfamiliar with .
The story , in discussing how Palin was selected as the running mate , recounts campaign manager Rick Davis 's reaction to how she dealt with the press .
One tape in particular struck Davis as arresting : an interview with Palin and Gov. Janet Napolitano , the Arizona Democrat , on “ The Charlie Rose Show ” that was shown in October 2007 .
Reviewing the tape , it did n’t concern Davis that Palin seemed out of her depth on health - care issues or that , when asked to name her favorite candidate among the Republican field , she said , “ I ’m undecided . ”
What he liked was how she stuck to her pet issues — energy independence and ethics reform — and thereby refused to let Rose manage the interview .
Not ready for prime time
The public , especially with her interview with CBS anchor Katie Couric , saw an uncomfortable , tightly scripted Palin who would - like a magnet - gravitate back to talking points instead of engaging in a real conversation .
The series of interviews were cringe - inducing and gave Saturday Night Live an abundance of material .
Sensing a sinking ship , reports are that some McCain staffers in attempts to save themselves from being blamed for a McCain - Palin loss are beginning to point fingers .
And in this case directly at the VP nominee , according to CNN .
" Her lack of fundamental understanding of some key issues was dramatic , " said another McCain source with direct knowledge of the process to prepare Palin after she was picked .
The source said it was probably the " hardest " to get her " up to speed than any candidate in history . "
She is ready
That 's not the Sarah Palin the Weekly Standard 's Fred Barnes knows .
" When I spent nearly two hours with Palin last year at the governor 's house in Juneau , I was struck by three things .
She 's very smart , brimming with self - confidence , and not intimidated by the media . "
Properly vetted or not ?
And further , if she is was as ill - prepared as some McCain staffers are saying , then it would suggest that she was never properly vetted -- something that was angrily taken off the table for discussion by the McCain team six weeks ago .
But they can't have it both ways .
Either she was properly vetted or not .
If she was properly vetted , then they knew what they were getting into .
If she was not properly vetted , then they can only blame themselves for the selection .
This morning 's New York Times article would suggest the vetting was not as thorough as the McCain team had implied .
The following night , after McCain ’s speech brought the convention to a close , one of the campaign ’s senior advisers stayed up late at the Hilton bar savoring the triumphant narrative arc .
I asked him a rather basic question : “ Leaving aside her actual experience , do you know how informed Governor Palin is about the issues of the day ?
” The senior adviser thought for a moment .
Then he looked up from his beer .
“ No , ” he said quietly .
“ I do n’t know . ”
She would have done fine
Even if she was n't up to speed on the issues , many believe she would have been fine without the handling overkill by the McCain staff .
Had she been able to interact with the media as she innately knows how to things would have been different .
At least Fred Barnes believes that .
" But [ campaign advisers ] simply did n't trust her to perform adequately in those settings .
She would need weeks of intense training and study .
They were wrong , and at Palin 's expense .
But they simply did n't trust her to perform adequately in those settings . "
$ 150,000
As far as the media now go , she may be the most accessible candidate of the four .
And controversy continues to follow her .
Every time the McCain team tries to create traction , another controversy emerges .
The $ 150,000 clothing tab is the latest misadventure to hit the campaign .
Speaking to Politico , an unknown supporter assigns blame to the campaign .
" It 's completely out - of - control operatives , " said the close ally outside the campaign .
" She has no responsibility for that .
It 's incredibly frustrating for us and for her . "
Regardless , she was n't afraid to bring it up this morning at a rally in Tampa .
In fact , she seemed to revel in it .
Comcast engineers have just released the first - ever real - world data on P4P technology — and it appears to be a massive success .
While only a trial , the results do show that P4P 's iTracker technology can increase P2P download speeds by 80 percent on ISP networks without materially increasing the network load .
P4P , which is being designed under the aegis of the Distributed Computing Industry Association , is meant to " localize " peer - to - peer transfers .
P2P users generally grab data from all around the world , putting tremendous cost and bandwidth pressure on ISP peering and transit links with other networks .
P4P uses an iTracker server to keep those transfers within an ISP 's own network when possible , with the goal of boosting speeds for users and lowering peering - point loads for ISPs .
( Note that P4P has little to do with network neutrality , though companies sometimes suggest that it does .
While it can decrease the financial hit ISPs take from sending traffic over transit links , P4P is n't designed to lower the total bandwidth on an ISP 's network .
In fact , by directing P2P users to " local " network sources , it might actually be expected to increase an ISP 's local network traffic .
More on that below . )
Comcast engineers have just filed the results of the first major P4P trial as an " Internet draft " with the IETF .
The trial involved Pando , Yale , three ( unnamed ) ISPs , and Comcast , and it took place over the summer .
It used a special , Pando - provided P2P client that is set up to check in with " iTracker " servers when searching for download locations in a BitTorrent swarm .
The test used a 21 MB video file ( which was " licensed , " in case you were worried ) , and measured the results of using the P2P client in order to see how the use of iTrackers affected uploads and downloads .
Data source : Comcast
Results were hugely positive .
Compared to a random swarm , the use of any iTracker provided substantial speed boosts to Comcast network users , ranging from 57 to 85 percent above default behavior .
For consumers , this would obviously be welcome news , but how does it affect Comcast ?
Not too much , it turns out .
" We did notice that download activity in our access network increased somewhat , from 56,030 MB for Random to 59,765 MB for P4P Generic Weight and 60,781MB for P4P Coarse Grained , " wrote the Comcast engineers .
That 's a small increase , especially given that it reduced Comcast 's " incoming Internet traffic by an average of 80 percent at peering points . "
But uploads proved even more surprising .
" It did not appear that P4P significantly increased upstream utilization in our access network , " note the engineers .
" In essence , uploading was already occurring no matter what and P4P in and of itself did not appear to materially increase uploading for this specific , licensed content . "
Further good news came from a close examination of the various iTrackers .
The fine - grained tracker provided detailed topology information about Comcast 's network , and it took significant time to set up .
" It was a detailed mapping of Comcast backbone - connected network Autonomous System Numbers ( ASN ) to IP Aggregates which were weighted based on priority and distance from each other , " says the report .
" Included in this design was a prioritization of all Peer and Internet transit connected ASNs to our backbone to ensure that P4P traffic would prefer settlement free and lower cost networks first , and then more expensive transit links . "
Sounds like a lot of work .
But Comcast found that it was n't even necessary ; simpler iTrackers provided even better results .
The best results came from the coarse - grained iTracker , which featured 22 iTracker node identifiers and " resulted in a 1,461 line configuration file . "
i Trackers can run on lightweight servers ; for good results , every ISP should run one .
While every network that deploys an iTracker will see good results , the system gets " dramatically " more impressive as more ISPs deploy it .
Comcast wants the iTracker mechanism made an IETF standard ; more impressively , it recognizes that iTrackers should be " opt - in " mechanisms that each user can control .
" The use of ISP - provided iTrackers should probably be an opt - in feature for P2P users , or at least a feature of which they are explicitly aware of and which has been enabled by default in a particular P2P client , " say the engineers .
" In this way , P2P users could choose to opt - in either explicitly or by their choice of P2P client in order to choose to use the iTracker to improve performance , which benefits both the user and the ISP at the same time . "
Win / win scenarios have n't been common in the P2P wars , and it 's important to note that this was only a preliminary test .
But if P4P shows the same promise in larger trials and if P2P clients start to embed the technology into their software , faster downloads and lower - traffic peering points could be had simply by running some inexpensive servers .
Britain ’s government has been warned that the country will enter into an “ agricultural disaster ” unless more money is put towards discovering what is killing the country ’s bees .
Protesters from the British Beekeepers Association ( BBKA ) , dressed in traditional , white beekeeper suits , delivered a petition signed by more than 140,000 people to Downing Street today , calling for £ 8 million funding research into causes of the bee decline .[ social_buttons ]
Over the past 12 months , one in three of Britain ’s honey bee colonies – amounting to nearly two billion bees , have been lost .
These losses are the greatest yet for the UK .
The causes of the massive die - off are unclear , and the apiarists fear there is nothing to prevent a similar devastation in the year to come .
The beekeepers claim that the Government is doing nothing to prevent it from happening .
It is thought that half of naturally occurring plants that birds and mammals depend upon bees for pollination .
The BBKA believes that agriculture will start to suffer from the loss of bees this spring when plants that have n’t been pollinated fail to bear fruit .
Tim Lovett , president of the BBKA , said the massive bee die - off would result in “ agricultural disaster and decline of wildlife ” .
“ All the time we lose bees we are putting at risk the pollination work force , ” he said .
“ Whilst we appear to have got away with it so far , we will reap the whirlwind of the pollination deficit eventually unless something is done . ”
One hundred years ago , the UK had around one million bee hives .
This number had reduced to 400,000 in the 1950s and more recently to the 274,000 beehives found in England today .
The Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs said it is developing a 10 - year bee health strategy , but as of yet they have committed no funds to the cause .

Somewhere in California -
At 8:30 PDT with the release of Snoopy Linux 2.1 and Goober Linux 1.0 , the number of Linux distributions finally surpassed the number of actual Linux users .
" We 've been expecting it for some time , " Merrill Lynch technology analyst Tom Shayes said , " but this is a little sooner than most expected .
We 've seen explosive growth in the number of Linux distributions , in fact my nephew just put out Little Tommy Linux 1.1 last week . "
Long time Linux guru Bob Tallman said , " This is great for the open source movement .
I have 7 different versions installed on my computer at home .
Some guys I know have over 30 . "
Microsoft CEO , Steve Ballmer said , " Microsoft will have to play catch up with the number of versions that Linux has , but we think we can do it .
With the break up of Microsoft imminent that will instantly double the number of Windows versions available . "
Microsoft also announced the release of Pocket PC for Workgroups , Windows GT special edition and Windows 2000 - the Director 's Cut with special code added by Bill Gates himself that was n't in the original release .

A suicide bomber has killed nine people and wounded 15 in an attack on a Shia mosque during Friday prayers , Iraqi police say .
Reports say the bombing took place in the town of Musayib , 80 km ( 50 miles ) south of the capital , Baghdad .
The attack comes a day after the Iraqi parliament backed a deal regulating the future presence of US troops .
Iraqi Shia cleric Moqtada Sadr has declared three days of mourning in response to the parliament 's decision .
Under the agreement , US troops will leave Iraqi streets by mid-2009 and quit Iraq entirely by the end of 2011 .
Levels of violence in Iraq have fallen to a four - year low , but bombings continue on an almost daily basis .
Mourning ceremonies Moqtada Sadr has the support of 30 MPs in the 275 member parliament and has thousands of gunmen under his command in his militia , the Mehdi Army .
We offer our condolences to the Iraqi people over this calamity that has fallen upon them with the signing of the agreement of humiliation and indignity
Statement by Moqtada Sadr
The militia is at present observing a ceasefire with the Iraqi government and US forces .
He has constantly opposed the US military presence and wants Iraq to expel American troops and end all negotiations with Washington .
In a statement he told his supporters to put up black flags , organise mourning ceremonies and hold peaceful demonstrations .
Some began in Sadrist controlled areas after Friday prayers .
Whilst Sadrists and their militia do control some areas of the country analysts believe their sway over the Shia community is reducing , BBC Baghdad correspondent Humphrey Hawksley reports .
It is widely thought Moqtada Sadr himself spends much of his time in Iran and that the major influence still lies with the Grand Ayatollah Ali Sistani .
He works in the holy city of Najaf and routinely holds talks with both Iraqi and foreign officials .
Ayatollah Sistani's influence was seen as key to the way the agreement with the US was approved , our correspondent says .
He insisted that the minority Sunni politicians were on board so it could be seen to encompass the interests of as many Iraqis as possible .

With the exception of what we ’re hearing from a few people like Jonathan Cohn , the rapidly congealing conventional wisdom of the Washington pundit class is that health care reform is a non-starter next year .
The assumption taking hold is that Barack Obama simply can’t afford to tackle it ; he ca n’t afford the money , and he ca n’t afford the political capital .
The way things generally work in Washington , the longer that idea stays out there , the more likely it is to become a reality .
That would be unfortunate , if recent history is any guide .
In 1993 , Bill Clinton decided to put off health care reform until his second year , focusing instead on putting some points on the board with his deficit - reduction plan and NAFTA .
The hope was that these victories would add momentum that would aid the health care effort .
The reality turned out to be the opposite :
By the time Clinton finally got around to health care in 1994 , his political capital had been drained and spent .
Will Obama make the same calculation ?
As Hillary Clinton told me in an interview shortly before Election Day this year : “ It ’s important to move simultaneously on several fronts , and I know how difficult that is .
But a new president has a honeymoon period . …
I hope that we ’re going to really make progress on health care , right off the bat , with a new Congress . …
I think the bottom line is that Americans are voting for change , and by that they mean they want to see a better life for themselves and their families and their country — and we ’re going to have to produce that . ”
That ’s why the 87 - page health care white paper that Senate Finance Committee Chairman Max Baucus released today –to much acclaim by unions and other groups interested in health care reform–could be so important .
The policy details are not all that significant ; the only real difference from Barack Obama ’s plan is that Baucus would put in a so - called “ individual mandate , ” which is a requirement that individuals who do not get coverage from their employers buy it on the open market .
Obama would make that decision voluntary , though his plan , like Baucus ’s , would strive to make it easier for people to afford it .
The key thing is that this is a signal from the chairman of the Finance Committee–one of the biggest hurdles for any effort –that he is intent on moving forward .
What remains to be seen is whether Congress and the new administration see health care reform as a priority that is secondary to an economic recovery , or one that is crucial making that recovery happen .
The germ - fighting power of bleach lies in its ability to unravel cellular proteins , according to a new study .
Researchers at the University of Michigan report that the active ingredient in bleach , hypochlorous acid , irreparably alters the three - dimensional structure of proteins in living cells — to fatal effect .
They also found that some bacteria possess a special protein that can somewhat counter the ravages of hypochlorous acid .
The findings clear up a hitherto murky understanding of how the common household cleaner does its job .
" Everyone knew that bleached worked , and that was enough , " says [ researcher Ursula Jacob ] .
" Few really cared how it worked " [ Nature News ] .
In fact , Jacob 's team did n't set out to answer that question either .
They were studying a bacterial protein known as heat shock protein 33 ( Hsp33 ) that helps other proteins maintain their proper shapes .
Hsp33 is activated in times of stress , such as when the bacteria is exposed to high temperatures .
" At high temperatures , proteins begin to lose their three - dimensional molecular structure and start to clump together and form large , insoluble aggregates , just like when you boil an egg , " said study lead author Jeannette Winter ...
Like a boiled egg , those proteins can never revert to their previous state , and the stressed cells eventually die [ LiveScience.com ] .
Jakob 's team figured out that bleach and high temperatures have very similar effects on proteins .
When they exposed the bacteria to bleach , the [ Hsp33 ] became active in an attempt to protect other proteins in the bacteria from losing their chemical structure [ Reuters ] .
When the researchers studied
But even bacteria with Hsp33 are typically no match for the protein - destroying effects of hypochlorous acid , the researchers report in

Bleach may have additional mechanisms of killing microbes , but the new understanding of hypochlorous acid 's role may have other implications beyond the toilet bowl .

It 's also believed that hypochlorous acid causes tissue damage in areas of chronic inflammation .

Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev welcomed Barack Obama 's victory in the US presidential election on Wednesday , saying he would bring " perestroika " to the United States , ITAR - TASS news agency reported .
" I am very happy .
Two or three years ago I said America needed perestroika , and this was greeted with cheers in the US , " Mr Gorbachev was quoted as saying , using the term for his 1980s liberal reforms that helped end the Cold War .
" It is no accident that the whole world followed these elections , including in Russia , where they were followed like never before .
This shows there is hope that the arrival of a new administration will bring changes , " he added .
Mr Gorbachev , a winner of the Nobel Peace Prize , added that the election of the United States ' first black president was a " lesson " for other countries and showed " a very strong side of America . "
Perestroika - a Russian word that translates roughly as " rebuilding " - was the name given to the liberal reforms Gorbachev introduced in the 1980s as he opened up the markets of the former Soviet Union .

President Bush on Tuesday signed into law a low - interest loan package to aid U.S. auto makers , but those struggling companies will still have to wait months to find out how and when they can tap the $ 25 billion designated to smooth their transition to building more fuel - efficient vehicles .
The loan package was approved last year as a way to help auto makers and their suppliers meet fuel - economy standards set by the federal government .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
An extensive federal report released Monday concludes that roughly one in four of the 697,000 U.S. veterans of the 1990 - 91 Gulf War suffer from Gulf War illness .
A U.S. soldier wears protection against chemical weapons during the Gulf War in a February 1991 photo .
That illness is a condition now identified as the likely consequence of exposure to toxic chemicals , including pesticides and a drug administered to protect troops against nerve gas .
The 452 - page report states that " scientific evidence leaves no question that Gulf War illness is a real condition with real causes and serious consequences for affected veterans . "
The report , compiled by a panel of scientific experts and veterans serving on the congressionally mandated Research Advisory Committee on Gulf War Veterans '
Illnesses , fails to identify any cure for the malady .
It also notes that few veterans afflicted with Gulf War illness have recovered over time .
" Today 's report brings to a close one of the darkest chapters in the legacy of the 1991 Gulf War , " said Anthony Hardie , a member of the committee and a member of the advocacy group Veterans of Modern Warfare .
" This is a bittersweet victory , [ because ] this is what Gulf War veterans have been saying all along , " Hardie said at a news conference in Washington .
" Years were squandered by the federal government ... trying to disprove that anything could be wrong with Gulf War veterans . "
The committee 's report , titled " Gulf War Illness and the Health of Gulf War Veterans , " was officially presented Monday to Secretary of Veterans Affairs James Peake .
Noting that overall funding for research into Gulf War illness has declined dramatically since 2001 , it calls for a " renewed federal research commitment " to " identify effective treatments for Gulf War illness and address other priority Gulf War health issues . "

Health Library MayoClinic.com : Health Library
According to the report , Gulf War illness is a " complex of multiple concurrent symptoms " that " typically includes persistent memory and concentration problems , chronic headaches , widespread pain , gastrointestinal problems , and other chronic abnormalities . "
The illness may also be potentially tied to higher rates of amyotrophic lateral sclerosis ( ALS ) -- more commonly known as Lou Gehrig 's Disease -- among Gulf War veterans than veterans of other conflicts .
The illness is identified as the consequence of multiple " biological alterations " affecting the brain and nervous system .
iReport.com : Do you know someone affected by Gulf War illness ?
While it is sometimes difficult to issue a specific diagnosis of the disease , it is , according to the report , no longer difficult to identify a cause .
The report identifies two Gulf War " neurotoxic " exposures that " are causally associated with Gulf War illness . "
The first is the ingestion of pyridostigmine bromide ( PB ) pills , given to protect troops from effects of nerve agents .
The second is exposure to dangerous pesticides used during the conflict .
The report does not rule out other possible contributors to Gulf War illness -- including low - level exposure to nerve agents and close proximity to oil well fires -- though it fails to establish any clear link .
The report concludes there is no clear link between the illness and a veteran 's exposure to factors such as depleted uranium or an anthrax vaccine administered at the time .
" Gulf War illness is n't some imaginary syndrome , " said Ken Robinson , the senior intelligence officer for the initial Department of Defense investigation into Gulf War illness in 1996 - 97 .
" This is real , and it has devastated families .
Now is the time to restore the funding cuts that have been made in the Veterans Administration .
Our mission has to be to ensure that these veterans get help and become whole again . "
Robinson noted that soldiers in the field today are not at risk for Gulf War illness , because the military is no longer using the PB pills or pesticides that led to the illness in 1990 and 1991 .
The report backs Robinson 's conclusion , noting that no problem similar to Gulf War illness has been discovered among veterans from the conflict in Bosnia in the 1990s or in the current engagements in Afghanistan and Iraq .
The committee report also backs Robinson 's call for more effective treatments among veterans suffering from Gulf War illness .
Noting that overall funding for research into Gulf War illness has declined dramatically since 2001 , it calls for a " renewed federal research commitment " to " identify effective treatments for Gulf War illness and address other priority Gulf War health issues . "
Specifically , the report calls for at least $ 60 million in new annual federal funding on research committed to improving the health of Gulf War veterans .

Hi all , Thx to the initiative of Scott and Steph we had an IRC discussion with several code developers .
The result is that we have decided to go with backslash as new separator for namespaces .
The IRC log that illustrates why we in the end decided to go with changing the separator and the final decision on backslash can be found on the wiki [ 1 ] .
Greg is working on a patch , however Dmitry said he will assist even though he was actually opposed to the decision we made in the end .
I very much appreciate Dmitry accepting this decision in such a professional manner .
At the same time I hope that all people that have participated in this discussion accept this decision as one that was made by a sufficiently large subset of the development community .
We did not take the decision lightly but we felt confident that this decision is for the best of PHP going forward .
As the patch is still under development it is yet unclear how this will affect the scheduling PHP 5.3 .

Teenager convinced her flat was haunted by previous tenant ' hanged herself during a vivid nightmare '
A teenager may have hanged herself while sleepwalking after becoming ‘ spooked ’ by stories of a recent suicide in her flat , an inquest heard .
Carissa Glenn , 18 , told her family she was having repeated nightmares about a woman who had apparently hanged herself in the rented apartment .
Miss Glen , who had a history of sleepwalking episodes in which she acted out her dreams , was found dead after hanging herself in her bathroom in the middle of the night .
Carissa Glenn : Regularly phoned her family believing her flat to have a ' presence '
Carissa ( right ) had a history of sleepwalking and feared that her flat was haunted by the ghost of a previous tenant
A coroner returned an open verdict because it was unclear whether she had deliberately hanged herself or did so accidentally in her sleep .
Yesterday , her mother Lusia Glenn , 59 , said : ‘ We think she was in a semi- conscious , dream - like state when it happened .
‘ Carissa had heard rumours of a woman who hanged herself in the flat and it really got to her .
She started saying she could feel her presence or sense her . ’
The teacher added : ‘ She would never do anything like this on purpose .
She must have sleepwalked and acted out her dream – she used to all the time .
Click enlarge to see full graphic
‘ She began having dreams about this woman .
She told me she was so spooked by it that she hated going back to her flat at night . ’
Miss Glenn moved from her home in Leeds to St Ives , Cornwall , after finishing her A - levels to be with friends she had met on family holidays .
She moved into the flat but soon after was told a previous female tenant had hanged herself there – a claim police later found to be untrue .
The week before she died in April , she rang her family three times complaining of a ‘ presence ’ in her flat , where she is thought to have lived alone .
Her family had pleaded with her to return home , and said they would pay any outstanding rent on the property .
Her sister Lara said : ‘ She was always spooked by the supernatural .
‘ She believed there was a presence in the flat and would mention it two or three times a week .
She was always talking about her dreams , they were vivid .
She must have been asleep or half - conscious when she died . ’
An inquest in Truro heard she was a ‘ happy young woman ’ who was popular with staff at the Sloop Inn where she worked as a barmaid .
The day before she died she worked a shift , had several drinks with friends and left in the early hours of the morning .
When she failed to turn up at the pub the next day , workmates broke into her flat and found her body .
A post -mortem examination showed the talented musician , who wanted to become a police officer , had twice the drink - drive limit of alcohol in her blood .
Deputy assistant coroner Dr Peter Blackwell - Smythe said : ‘ There was concern about a local rumour that someone had hanged themselves in the flat where she was living .
And then there was the matter of her vivid nightmares , which were a disturbance
for her .
‘ It appears she was a happy young woman who was vivacious .
I appreciate concerns about her sleepwalking and her nightmares .
‘ It would be reasonable to leave the verdict open , although I believe the evidence strongly suggests she did take her own life . ’
The court also heard that she had been upset by the death of a friend and learning that her ex-boyfriend was to marry .
A family statement read : ‘ She was a strikingly beautiful girl , intelligent and vivacious with everything to live for .
‘ Many who love her and feel very close to her are still shocked and mystified by her sudden death .
None who knew her will ever forget her . ’
Last May , an exhibit sponsored by the government of the Mexican state of Sinaloa compelled civic leaders in Culiacán , the capital , to denounce the artist Rosa María Robles and demand that the show be closed down .
Comments left in the visitors ’ book were n’t as harsh .
After wandering aghast through installations that featured bloodied toilets and suspended children ’s outfits pierced by dried cow tongues or long , knobby rubber penises , viewers wrote things like “ It gave me nausea , but it made me think ” and “ This was very hard ; it made me want to cry . ”
A few even thanked Robles for the exhibit .
Sometimes a black boot was displayed in the act of shattering an ostrich egg .
Not every viewer may have understood that this was the artist ’s way of critiquing the macho narcotraficante culture of her native state , which has brought with it uncounted acts of violence , including hundreds of murders each year .
But many did understand : people in Sinaloa know that los narcos actually wear those absurd boots — most fashionably made of ostrich leather — and in these hard times every day brings news of more lives they have shattered .
And even a clueless outsider could grasp the meaning of the exhibit ’s most controversial and memorable installation , referred to in the catalogue as “ Red Carpet . ”
It was pieced together from the heavy woollen blankets typical of the Sinaloa mountain region , which , in the exhibit , were stiff with dried blood .
Everyone in Sinaloa knows by now that in the wave of drug - related murders some of the most notorious victims have been the levantados , or pickups : cops or police chiefs or traffickers who are kidnapped , and whose mutilated corpses , wrapped in blankets , appear later .
Rosa María
Robles had somehow managed to obtain some of the blood - soaked blankets that had been used in such murders , but after the show opened state investigative police confiscated the blankets , on the ground that they are legal evidence .
Robles , a tiny , wiry , loquacious woman who wears tight jeans and clingy tops , has spent most of her life in Culiacán .
In the mid-nineties , she earned a respectable reputation crafting enormous , menhir - like monuments from tree trunks that fetched up on the banks of a river that runs through the city .
Her artistic concerns at the time , she told me , were mainly ecological .
In 2006 , her work took a different turn when , in a sort of trance , she began assembling the exhibit she called “ Navajas ” ( “ Razors ” ) .
The various installation pieces came together quickly “ and without stumbling , ” she said one afternoon in her home , a sparsely furnished rented house in a dusty neighborhood on the outskirts of the city .
“ They ask me why I want to give this negative image of Sinaloa , ” she said .
“ But I do n’t .
The image is already there .
‘ Razors ’ is about violence , but it calls for a reflection about the signs of decadence that surround us . ”
“ Razors ” is both raw and stagy , and overwhelming in a way that does not really play fair with the viewer .
Indeed , Robles could be accused of trafficking in the same kind of bloody one - upmanship that the drug trade is currently engaged in .
( When the authorities confiscated the bloody blankets , she cut one of her veins , collected the blood in a chamber pot , and painted a new set of blankets with it . )
But , in her messy response to the mayhem around her , Robles , like many Mexicans who watched indifferently as the drug terror developed over the decades , is only just learning how to react to it .
Sinaloa lies on the Pacific Ocean , six hundred and fifty miles south of the United States border .
There is a significant fishing industry , some tourism along the coast , a fertile valley around Culiacán ( in which a good portion of all the tomatoes , eggplants , and melons consumed in the United States is grown ) , and , east of this , a scraggly , steep , and serrated mountain range .
This is the Sierra Madre Occidental ; few paved roads wind along these mountains .
Cannabis grows widely in the region .
During the dry season , the sierra is parched ; when the rains come , it bursts into life long enough for a poppy crop to bloom , leaving behind fields of round green pods heavy with narcotic milk .
Spraying crops that grow at such a steep incline is difficult ; persuading smallholders to eradicate a crop that offers prosperity and has been a way of life for decades is almost always impossible .
Given the conditions , there is nothing surprising about the persistence of a clandestine drug trade in the region .
What is unusual , perhaps , is how wrong things had to go before anyone paid attention .
In Sinaloa , Javier Valdez Cárdenas , a reporter , columnist , and editor for the scrappy local newspaper Río Doce , is an exception to the general indifference .
Having for years made it his business to know a great deal about drug issues , he is a mandatory stop for Mexican and foreign journalists trying to figure out the Culiacán drug scene .
Valdez is about forty , stocky , swarthy , and graying , but there is something of the cocky teen - ager in his manner .
We had lunch on a scorching Culiacán afternoon , and he recited with studied weariness the stages of his home state ’s emergence as the crucible of Mexico ’s drug crisis .
It was in the late nineteenth century , he said , that the opium harvest first became visible , encouraged by the arrival of Chinese immigrants who had come to build a railroad .
There was , he added , the long - standing local use of marijuana , particularly by Mexican soldiers , who got through the useless hours of patrol and guard duty with the help of a spliff or two .
There was the almost certainly apocryphal — but nevertheless widely believed — story that during the Second World War the United States urged Sinaloa to boost its ( illegal ) production of opium in order to meet the medical needs of G.I.s wounded in combat .
There was , for real , the gigantic marijuana boom in the nineteen - sixties , fuelled by demand in the United States .
And , Valdez noted , there was the notable decline in illegal crop harvests in the late seventies , as the result of a series of violent and ambitious assaults on growers carried out by the Mexican federal police with the support of the Mexican Army , and with the energetic encouragement of the United States Drug Enforcement Administration .
“ That was when the drug trade really began to expand , ” Valdez said .
“ Because the few traffickers who remained here were killed , but all the rest of them emigrated .
Now they ’re all over the country . ”
Forty years after Operación Intercepción — which was followed by Operación Cooperación , Operación Cóndor , and other drug - war initiatives — as much as thirty per cent of Mexico ’s arable land is suspected of being under cultivation for clandestine crops , drug violence in Sinaloa has taken a quantitatively different turn , and the Sinaloa traffickers have generated entire dynasties of criminals who are at war in nearly every one of Mexico ’s thirty - one states , as well as Mexico City .
The exiles who left Sinaloa for Tijuana , Guadalajara , and Ciudad Juárez in the nineteen - seventies included members of the Arellano Félix family ; a bold operator called Joaquín Guzmán ; and a schemer with a talent for international relations , Amado Carrillo .
They and their elders spent the next two decades collaborating with Colombia ’s drug kings on clandestine routes for delivering cocaine and marijuana to the United States .
Beginning in the mid-nineties , after Pablo Escobar was killed and his main rivals were arrested , the Mexican associates assumed their rightful position in the global drug economy .
The main access points to what is by far the largest market for drugs in the world are , after all , in Mexico .
By the turn of the millennium , Mexico was exporting heroin and marijuana , transporting the majority of Colombian cocaine , and collaborating with Chinese traders in the production and export of methamphetamines .
The Sinaloa traffickers , who had not necessarily remained friends , controlled access to all the major border points , with the exception of the ones in the Gulf Coast state of Tamaulipas .
Those , the government believes , were the domain of Osiel Cárdenas , a particularly violent local trafficker .
With its key border cities of Nuevo Laredo ( on the other side of the Rio Grande from Laredo ) and Matamoros ( across from Brownsville ) , the state of Tamaulipas is a coveted prize that Osiel Cárdenas ’s former associates now control .
They are , for the most part , ex-members of an élite Army anti-narcotics unit , operating under the code name los Zetas , and they have drastically upped the ante on all forms of violence ; the practice of beheading their victims is one of their signal contributions to the drug trade .
Drug careers tend not to last very long : Osiel Cárdenas has been awaiting trial in the United States for nearly two years , since pleading innocent in February , 2007 .
Three of the Arellano Félix brothers , who operated out of Tijuana , are dead or in jail , and one was arrested last week .
The most skillful trafficker of them all , Amado Carrillo , who once had a fleet of jets to ferry his goods from his base in Ciudad Juárez , and who liked to be called the Lord of the Skies , is also gone .
In 1997 , having decided to move his business to South America and set up housekeeping in Buenos Aires , he went to Mexico City for radical liposuction and facial renovation .
He died in the recovery room , from a fatal mix of anesthetics and sleeping potion , according to newspapers at the time .
( His attending physicians died as well , discovered months later encased in cement . )
The most visible member of the exile generation of drug traffickers still at large is Joaquín Guzmán , commonly known as El Chapo ( a Sinaloan term for men who are short and built like refrigerators ) .
It is said by people in Sinaloa that , seven years after El Chapo escaped from prison in a laundry cart and rose to the top of law enforcers ’ most - wanted lists ( and an unspecified amount of time since he acquired a jet plane that , according to some reports , was once used by the C.I.A. for rendition flights ) , he still throws parties at his ranch in the Sinaloa hill country .
It is said that he recently closed down a restaurant in Culiacán , confiscating the other diners ’ cell phones until he and his friends had finished their meal ( and paid handsomely for the meals of his hostages as well ) , and that , at a wake in Culiacán in May , some of El Chapo ’s men showed up to ask if the bereaved family would move , at no further cost , to a more elegant parlor at another location .
When the family complied , the body of Joaquín Guzmán ’s hulking son , Edgar , who had been shot down outside a shopping mall , was brought in .
And it is said that the street was then closed off so that El Chapo could weep over his murdered child in privacy .
Those are the stories .
What is certain is that the campaign that has filled Mexican life with daily news of vicious crime — torture , kidnappings , beheadings — is being fought by Chapo Guzmán against his former allies .
These include , first of all , the Beltrán Leyva family , which allegedly ordered the murder of Edgar and which , it was reported last week , may have infiltrated the U.S. Embassy in Mexico .
But Guzmán is also locked in combat with the remaining members of the Arellano Félix drug clan , in Tijuana ; with the brother of the plastic - surgery victim Amado Carrillo ; and , above all , with the heirs of the Gulf Coast empire created by the extradited Osiel Cárdenas .
The fight is over drug routes , particularly those that end in Tamaulipas and serve as access points to the United States , and over profitable illicit local businesses like prostitution and the smuggling of illegal immigrants .
Included in the territorial bounty is the right to control an unknown number of the police and the military — cops and commanders both — who moonlight as the traffickers ’ henchmen .
Since Edgar ’s murder , there has been a surge in drug - related killings throughout the country .
Nearly four thousand people have died so far this year .
Sometimes the corpses are wrapped in the kinds of woollen blankets that Robles used for her “ Red Carpet . ”
Sometimes the victims are beheaded .
The bodies often show signs of torture .
Javier Valdez , the journalist who monitors these matters , notes that the murder of Guzmán ’s son signalled the beginning of a new type of war .
“ Before that death , they had n’t messed with each other ’s families , ” and killings were highly targeted , he said .
“ Ahora va a estar más cabrón ” ( “ Now the shit is going to hit the fan ” ) .
He suggested that I visit one of Culiacán ’s newest cemeteries .
“ I ’m sure they wo n’t be eating all the dog food . ”

The cemetery has grown at a staid pace during the past forty years , but it seemed to me that now it could hardly keep up with demand .
By eight o’clock that morning , earthmovers were digging up new sections .
Some workers were laying in a honeycomb of new graves ; others labored over an enormous new mausoleum .
A man who has known the cemetery over a long period of time , and proved to be gregarious and helpful in the local way , provided a statistic : thirty per cent of the graveyard ’s permanent residents had met a violent end .
By and large , he said , they were up - country farmers , who got rich very quickly and died suddenly .
The new mausoleums reflected the tension between the relatives ’ need to mourn and their Sinaloan impulse to show off .
No excess was too excessive , no preconceived notion of what a burying ground might contain stood in the way of creativity .
Next to a massive black marble monument , with carved - stone columns and a chapel large enough to accommodate several rows of plastic chairs , one might turn to face an orange two - story affair with a cupola , a bell tower , balconies , and aluminum - frame windows that handsomely achieved a Fiesta Inn effect .
Banners with portraits of the jowly , shirtsleeved deceased hung from the crenellated wall of another .
A child ’s shrine was covered with a mural of SpongeBob SquarePants .
A modernist structure was crowned with a Pei - like crystal pyramid , encasing for all eternity a silver heart - shaped helium balloon .
“ What the families want , ” the man said , “ is for their mausoleum to demonstrate the power they have over things . ”
Photographs of the departed showed bullish , thick - necked men in their mid-twenties or thirties , looking bored and dangerous , wearing bluejeans and extravagantly pointy ostrich - skin boots .
In this boastful arena , the pictures had also been carefully chosen to show the dead man at his best .
He frequently appeared on a chapel ’s altar , unsmiling and surrounded by many bottles of whiskey , or perhaps even more bottles of beer ; the implicit epitaph of the deceased was this : he could drink anybody under the table .
Felipe Calderón , a member by family tradition of the conservative Partido Acción Nacional ( PAN ) , took over as his party ’s second President of the current era in December of 2006 , following seventy years of uncontested rule by the Partido Revolucionario Institucional , or PRI .
Calderón ’s election was contested , and he was perceived by much of the electorate as a weak leader .
The need to overcome this impression may have been a factor in his decision , almost immediately upon taking office , to involve the military in renewed combat against the drug trade — a fight that his predecessor , Vicente Fox , had less visibly pursued .
The sight of troops patrolling the major arteries of cities like Ciudad Juárez and Morelia in armored cars has generated enormous local resentment , and offers vast opportunities for corruption in a military that , compared with the security forces , is not loathed , and remains — if only in the most relative terms — uncorrupt .
( Among the many exceptions is an Army general who was removed as drug czar some years ago , when it was discovered that he was actually working for the Juárez drug trade . )
Regardless , troops are now deployed across the country , resulting in mounting tension between the local security forces and the federal troops .
Quite a few high - level arrests have been made , but drug crimes have increased wherever the troops patrol , a consequence of what several people I talked to described as “ stirring up the chicken coop . ”
A certain nostalgia for the days when the PRI was in charge and the drug traffickers knew their place would have been unthinkable a couple of years ago , but it has encouraged old PRIistas to believe that the party can return to power in the 2012 elections .
In large part , though , it was the PRI ’s defeat — or , rather , the long - withheld recognition of its defeat — and the dawn of real electoral politics that led to what appears to be the drug trade ’s thorough infiltration of the political parties .
This last according to a PRIista whom I shall call Héctor , who enjoyed a long and successful national career before retiring to his home state .
In the old days , much of the money for what was essentially a ceremonial presentation of the candidate to his subjects came from the vast coffers of the one - party state .
Modern media campaigns put an end to all that .
“ Thanks to the television stations , our campaign needs multiplied , ” Héctor explained .
“ A congressman ’s electoral campaign can now run to sixteen , seventeen million dollars . ”
Where is such money to come from ?
Informed opinion has it that each of the major drug groups now has ties to significant numbers of politicians in its party of choice , if not to the party itself .
As for the current military offensive , Héctor gave a little snort of disgust .
“ When you see what amounts to a military parade in these towns , in which the Army is trooping along on the main avenue while on the side streets people are killing each other . . . when I see how these people ” — the traffickers — “ are climbing up right into the very beard of the state , I think , Holy fuck !
This country could really collapse ! ”
There are limits on the way the government can wage its war on drugs .
A government spokesman , Miguel Monterrubio , pointed out recently that when President Calderón came to office there were ten thousand federal law - enforcement agents in the entire country .
Today , the total has increased to nearly thirty thousand — still a small number in a country that has a hundred and ten million people and a raging crime problem .
“ That ’s why the government decided to involve the Army , ” Monterrubio told me over coffee one morning .
“ If not them , who ? ”
There remains the problem of corruption .
Several new vetting agencies , Monterrubio said , will conduct ongoing polygraph tests and background checks on all law - enforcement personnel .
In the old days , there was a de-facto agreement between the government and the traffickers that the traffickers would kill each other among themselves .
“ But now , ” Monterrubio said , “ the traffickers have realized that they can use the murders to send a message through the media .
It ’s narco - terror . ”
Calderón ’s policy , which the Bush Administration is supporting with a $ 1.4 - billion aid package , to be delivered beginning this year , is heavily weighted on the side of hardware and training for joint U.S. - Mexican operations along the border .
Some critics would prefer a program that placed more emphasis on treatment for drug addiction and less on shootouts , but the question of whether a battle against drug use can be won by deploying military force is not one that government officials are willing to ask at this juncture .
From the public ’s point of view , the government ’s crackdown has simply produced more violence .
“ In the end , it ’s all absurd , ” Froylán Enciso , a friend of mine who is a historian specializing in the drug trade , remarked the other day .
“ The class solidarity between the troops and the growers is far greater than the soldiers ’ need to obey orders .
They bargain : ‘ I need a statistic and you need to survive in this environment , so let ’s deal . ’
And the government gets its statistic , because every year they have to have a record - breaking figure for the press conference — more kilos of marijuana confiscated , more arrests made than ever before .
And the cost that does n’t get factored into the figures ” — how much a kilo of cocaine paste sells for at the point of manufacture versus its street value — “ is the cost of the narcocultura .
Because the logistics and the infrastructure and the narco - helicopters and narco - submarines are only a part of it .
The real value of the drugs is the cost incurred by traffickers , small and large , in steeling themselves against the risks involved in delivering the drugs to the final consumer .
The narcocultura — the mausoleums and the music and the baseball caps embroidered with marijuana leaves in Swarovski crystals — is the array of symbols they surround themselves with in order to ward off that fear . ”
On the first day of every month , at the Tepito metro stop in downtown Mexico City , a new breed of pilgrim can be observed inching his way on his knees out of the stop and down a filthy market street , and cradling in his arms , babylike , a plastic figure of Death — or Holy Death , La Santa Muerte , as the pilgrims refer to the robed skeleton , who carries , variously , a scythe , a sceptre , a set of scales , or a globe in her ( sometimes his ) hands .
There were dozens of these effigies , borne by crawling men in their teens or early twenties .
Tattooed and gaunt , they were dressed in black T - shirts with the sleeves ripped off and wore chains around their necks and silver skulls , like brass knuckles , on their fingers .
Their goal was some four blocks distant , in the heart of Tepito , a legendary neighborhood that in the centuries since the Spanish Conquest has remained stubbornly insubordinate .
Venders were everywhere along the pilgrims ’ path , hawking T - shirts and baseball caps and medals decorated with the Santa Muerte .
The shrine of the Holy Death is just blocks away from a compound of low - income housing where , in 2007 , Mexico City police conducted a full - scale assault in search of drugs , weapons , and other illegal goods .
Enriqueta Romero Romero , known as Queta , or Quetita , set up the shrine on this spot seven years ago after one of her sons , who was himself a devotee of La Santa , made her a gift of the skeleton .
The bewigged saint now stands in a glass case , elaborately robed and veiled according to Queta ’s inspiration — sometimes in rainbow gauze , sometimes in white lace .
Queta and her son also more or less invented the 8 P.M. “ Rosary ” that is held on the first of every month , and draws thousands of the faithful , including the skull - ringed young men who , at a guess , make a paltry living running many kinds of errands for the lords of Tepito .
Queta says the skeleton is feminine — the Niña Blanca , or White Girl - Child — and that those who say there is such a thing as a He - Death , and that one should have both on one ’s home altar , so the two can meet and marry , are charlatans .
Queta is small , sixtyish , and bustling ; she blows kisses at her Niña every other sentence and has a benevolent smile for everyone .
But her gaze can narrow with suspicion in an alarming fashion , and one has the sense that she can summon dangerous help to her side very quickly .
The Santa Muerte had been hanging around the fringes of popular belief in Tepito and other raffish neighborhoods for decades — Queta says that she learned to pray to her from her aunt — but thanks to Queta her cult now extends throughout Mexico City and far beyond .
There are , by Queta ’s count , two thousand shrines like hers in Mexico , and who knows if she is including the charlatans in her tally ?
( The cult is known for the drug traffickers ’ devotion to it , but it certainly embraces a far larger number of believers . )
Hers , at any rate , was the first public shrine , and it holds a cathedral - like status for worshippers like Felicitas Castillo , a young woman who for the past five years has travelled once a month from the city of Xalapa , two hundred miles away , in order to offer the “ Utmost Holy Death ” roses and a mariachi serenade .
On the day that I visited the shrine , the musicians played ranchera songs that are normally dedicated to the Virgin of Guadalupe , and Castillo provided an answer heard many times when I asked the faithful what they prayed for .
“ I do n’t ask for much , ” Castillo said .
“ Health for my family , work . ”
This is an answer recommended by Queta , who does n’t think that one should bargain with Death or be greedy .
But the following afternoon , as the time for the Rosary drew near and worshippers pressed more and more tightly into the narrow street where the shrine is situated , one crawling young man said that he was praying for his ex-girlfriend , who lived in another state , to let him see his five - month - old daughter .
A woman wanted the holy figure to help her get over the suicide , last year , of her fourteen - year - old son .
Most of those killed in the Lockerbie bombing were Americans Libya has paid $ 1.5 bn into a US compensation fund for relatives of victims of terror attacks blamed on Tripoli , the US state department says .
The fund was agreed in August to settle remaining lawsuits in the US .
The attacks include the 1988 Lockerbie bombing that killed 270 people and the 1986 bombing of a Berlin disco which killed three and wounded more than 200 .
Under the deal , Libya did not accept responsibility for the attacks , but agreed to compensate victims .
The BBC's Kim Ghattas in Washington says it is the final step in a long diplomatic process , which has seen Libya come back into the international fold .
No US taxpayer money
The first $ 300 m Libyan payment into the fund was made on 9 October , shortly after an historic visit to Tripoli by US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice .
Its second payment of $ 600 m was received on Thursday and a final instalment of $ 600 m was made on Friday , said David Welch , the US diplomat who negotiated the settlement .
In exchange , President Bush has signed an executive order restoring the Libyan government 's immunity from terror - related lawsuits and dismissing pending compensation cases in the US , the White House said .
Our correspondent says it is unclear why it took so long for the money to be paid into the fund .
She adds that there may have been contributions by American companies lured by business opportunities in Tripoli and keen to expedite the process of normalising ties .
The US and Libya agreed to the compensation deal in August The US State Department , however , has insisted that no money from the American taxpayer will be used for the US portion of the fund .
Libya has already paid the families of Lockerbie victims $ 8 m ( £ 4 m ) each , but it owes them $ 2 m more .
The fund will also be used to compensate relatives of seven Americans who died in the bombing of a French UTA airliner over Chad in 1989 .
In 2004 , Libya agreed to pay $ 35 m in compensation to non-US victims of the 1986 Berlin bombing .
In the same year , relatives of non-US victims of the UTA bombing accepted a payment of $ 1 m each from the Gaddafi International Foundation for Charity Associations .
Relations between Libya and the US improved in 2003 when Tripoli stopped working on weapons of mass destruction .
The decision led to the restoration of US diplomatic ties with Libya in 2006 .
In turn , it was removed from America 's list of countries sponsoring terrorism .

A valuable asset such as a vehicle is common on this loan .
The borrower may still keep the vehicle , but the lender will always have the right to sell the asset when payment defaults occur .
Rabin On The State Of Game AI
Pfeifer On AI In EA's LMNO
The Best Of The Rest
Conclusion - More Collaboration , Please ?
Late last month , international AI developers and researchers alike flocked to the annual Artificial Intelligence and Interactive Digital Entertainment Conference at Stanford University .
Led by researchers Michael Mateas offame and Chris Darken of the Naval Postgradual School , the AIIDE conference focused specifically on bringing AI game programmers together with AI academics to share findings and discuss future collaborations .
Thirty talks were given over three days covering topics ranging from NPC reasoning to designer tools to procedural dialogue creation .
The conference was best represented by Steve Rabin , Nintendo developer and AI Game Programming Wisdom editor , and Borut Pfeifer , Lead AI Programmer on EA LA'sRabin 's presentation was a great overview of where game AI has been , where it is going , and why this conference was important .
Citing originators such as , and Tamagotchi , he called out the work of several recent developers as signposts : with its universal speech recognition , and its enemy planning system , 's use of neural nets to drive cars , and 's interactive story and natural language processing .
This year , games continued to show AI as a core part of the industry 's future.used Euphoria to create procedural skeletons and generate procedural crowds , dynamically skinned and animated many - limbed creatures , andandcreated procedurally - driven experience managers .
Rabin talked about the challenges that future development is facing : costs are rising , risk is greater .
CPU power is improving , but we have n't found a strong AI use for it .
Middleware and shared AI architecture are still seeking their way .
Procedural content is becoming even more pervasive , and will continue to impact both audiences and developers .
But Rabin put forth his own challenge for the future : Despite all this , why is AI still allowed to suck ?
Because , in his view , sharp AI is just not required for many games , and game designers frequently do n't get what AI can do .
That was his challenge for this AIIDE -- to show others the potential , and necessity , of game AI , to find the problems that designers are trying to tackle , and solve them .
Pfeifer went right at one of these problems : believable human characters . , EA LA 's codenamed second collaboration with Steven Spielberg following , is exploring tech that brings " Spielbergness " to character AI .
Pfeifer is using Spielberg 's understanding of acting to construct a new AI framework built on clear player - AI communication .
He wants characters to be understandable as well as intelligent -- when players talk about " dumb " AI , they usually mean the AI 's motives are n't clear .
Pfeifer showed a number of Spielberg 's movie clips as examples -- E.T. and Elliott learning to communicate , the first murder in Munich , and the golden idol scene from Raiders of the Lost Ark .
He identified six key human qualities in each of these character clips the AI should express : conflicting motivations , reactions , attention , meaning , emotional simulation , and physicality .
But there were three recurring problems in his approach : control and feedback between the AI and animation layers , the mind - body communication problem , and the complexity explosion of assets .
According to Pfeifer , handling these common problems opens the gate to realistic characters .
While his work is still in progress , he did put forward some solutions : communicate AI failure upwards rather then handling it on lower levels ; do n't hesitate to abstract the surrounding environment and its motions for the general cases , so not every NPC gets details on everything ; think of your characters as always animating with adverbs ; and define contexts that give characters a larger comprehension of their situation and how to react .
For example , inside a classroom there would be one specific set of social norms if it 's full , a different set if it 's empty , and wholly unrelated reactions when being shot at .
Pfeifer believes that handling these contexts gives authors the ability to create meanings that can be translated into behaviors and more traditional AI , mentioning in the Q&A that " non-humans " are in some way the subject of the AI inSince the AIIDE conference took place , layoffs at Electronic Arts Los Angeles may have affected the development of , though EA has denied that it has been canceled . ]
Other presentations on the program went straight at game development challenges , as well .
For example :- John Reeder looked at using reinforcement learning to model and balance notoriously slippery MMO economies .-
An interesting proposal from John - Paul Kelly explored using planning to auto - craft AI scripts for - David Pizzi showed off his work forauto - generating walkthrough storyboards for designers . -
Jacob Schrum presented a novel nueroevolution approach to create bots that handle conflicting objectives . -
Mark J. Nelson proposed an exciting use of formal logic for design tools that could quickly test and balance design mechanics , providing a new sort of design - demonstrable .- M. Renee Jansen and Alejandro Isaza each demonstrated an interesting new approach for pathfinding .- Christina R. Strong laid out research towards true procedural dialogue .-
Anne Sullivan , Sherol Chen , and David
Thue all had exciting data showing that AI experience management created significantly better games .
From their work and others , it seems this new sort of AI will be a competitive requirement in many games in the next five years . -
Invited speaker and composer David Cope shared his insights on proceduralism from the last 30 years , generating beautiful new Rachmaninoff piano concertos in Eliza , another signpost in AI 's past .
Much of this work will likely find its way into game projects and GDC soon .
But there was a larger theme at the conference : AI research needs game designers to guide it .
There is fantastic research going on , and the conference is a big step towards getting it to development , but solving AI problems without considering common game design challenges has little utility .
And yet trying to predict the needs of game design without designers is paralyzing .
There were encouraging signs at the conference that the game designer - AI programmer - AI researcher relationship is improving .
The next big step for AIIDE is to truly integrate these designer 's perspectives and their game AI problems , and then to bring together AI researchers and developers to solve them .
Armed with extra money from a second job , help from two family members and research into flat - screen - TV sale prices , Ray Billburg had a shopping strategy .
The 20 - year - old Gilbert resident , with his brother and cousin , hit Circuit City at 5 a.m.
Friday , two hours before it opened .
The goal : Secure a 40 - inch , high - resolution , flat - screen TV .
Like many Valley shoppers constrained by economic conditions , they showed up early but targeted just one or two items and did n't spend on spur - of - the - moment purchases .
" The rent is due on Monday , so I ca n't get too crazy , " Billburg said .
As night turned to dawn , shoppers turned out throughout the Valley in numbers similar to past years .
The pre-holiday excitement was there , but shoppers uniformly said they were spending with caution .
Flat - panel TV and laptop deals , children 's toys , video games , practical housewares , and heavily discounted high - end clothing and accessories fared well , according to local and national reports .
Many shoppers said they were sticking to a budget and simply walked away when they did n't find low - priced goods .
Their frugality , analysts say , could hurt retailers and force them to make deeper discounts before Christmas .
After waiting to be among the first inside Circuit City , Billburg and his family raced to the TV section and commandeered two models .
But the mission was n't over .
Billburg said he planned to pay cash and would n't have the money until his bank opened at 9 a .m .
The younger relatives would have to stay at the store and guard the goods .
" They want the TV just as badly as me , " Billburg said .
Monitoring sales
The day after Thanksgiving is dubbed Black Friday , referring to the heavy sales volume that traditionally has put many stores " in the black , " or into profitability , for the year .
Economists will be watching the sales from this Black Friday more closely , hoping to see just how deeply consumers are taking the economic downturn to heart .
Estimates will be available early next week .
Although Friday 's steep price cuts , which were even more aggressive than the deep discounting offered throughout the month , are great for consumers , such moves are expected to depress sales and profits in a season that many believe could show a rare contraction in spending , according to Janet Hoffman , managing partner of the North American retail practice of Accenture .
" Everybody is feeling the crunch , " said Rachelle Williamson , 27 , a stay - at - home mom shopping at a north Scottsdale Walmart .
" I 'm looking for the good deals , but not just because it is a good deal .
We want good deals on stuff that we need . "
' Practical Christmas '
Black Friday is n't a predictor of sales for the season , because the bulk of holiday sales occurs in the final days before Dec. 25 .
But it does serve as a barometer for consumers ' willingness to spend .
Last year , the Thanksgiving weekend accounted for 10.1 percent of holiday sales .
Patricia Edwards , a national retail analyst for Seattle - based Storehouse Partners , said that discounters such as Walmart had heavy traffic on Friday while some upscale stores struggled .
Edwards said demand for expensive gaming systems dropped , but shoppers still bought video games .
" It 's very definitely going to be a practical Christmas , " Edwards said .
Expect bigger price cuts by Christmas if stores do n't see big sales this weekend , she said .
" There is a lot of inventory on the floors , " Edwards said .
" I have a feeling we will see more discounts . "
Retailers got some signals Friday that the shopping season wo n't be a total bust , because even a weak Black Friday coaxes some shoppers into spur - of - the moment purchases .
Donna Brown , 54 , a nurse from Cave Creek , browsed through watches with her husband , Art , at Kohl 's in Scottsdale .
They had already bought $ 10 sleeping bags at Sports Authority to donate to the homeless and a printer for themselves .
" We are not as frisky about spending , " Donna said .
America 's Research Group in Charleston , S.C. , surveyed shoppers across the country and found similar sentiment .
" It was clear they had special items they were going to buy , and they did n't buy anything else , " Chairman Britt Beemer said .
" If they could get that one item , they did .
If not , they walked out without it . "
Purchases of the doorbuster deals that retailers use to lure customers wo n't make a profitable season without impulse purchases , too , he said .
" We are not seeing consumers walk out with three or four bags , " he said .
" That is kind of scary . "
Brian Parks , 51 , a firefighter from Paradise Valley , was loading up on tools at Sears at Paradise Valley Mall .
" I just came out because there were specials on the tools I wanted , " Parks said .
" This is the only store I 'm going to , then I 'm going home to hide . "
' No money to shop '
Sale prices were n't low enough for many shoppers .
Jesus Abril , 51 , a Gilbert resident who lost his job in September after Bill Heard Chevrolet closed , was in and out of Circuit City with his wife and son in minutes .
" Last year , we would walk in and see something on sale and get it , " Abril said .
" We are not spending money frivolously . "
At Mervyn's at Superstition Springs Center in Mesa , morning shopping was so light that some cashiers milled around .
It is the last Black Friday for the store because it is closing , which some customers lamented .
" It 's kind of sad to see a store of this quality go under , " said Dave Ward of Queen Creek .
" It 's a sign of the times . "
The economy might weaken spending but not spirit , some shoppers said .
Thursday night , a crowd of about 30 people waited outside Best Buy on Southern Avenue and Alma School Road in Mesa with tents , blankets , chairs and even a barbecue grill .
First in line was Danielle Jackson , 30 , a single mom from Mesa , who had been waiting outside since Tuesday night .
" We did n't know each other before we came , but now we do , " Jackson said of the crowd .
" I even barbecued steaks and burgers for everyone .
We had our Thanksgiving dinner here . "
Nessa Nejat , 21 , of Mesa and a student at Arizona State University , said she was there just as company for a friend who was buying a computer .
" I have bills .
I have rent .
The economy is affecting me , " Nejat said .
" I have no money to shop . "

Florida State safety Myron Rolle was awarded a Rhodes scholarship Saturday .
He is the first major - college football player of his generation to win what is considered the world ’s most prestigious postgraduate academic scholarship .
He became the most prominent student - athlete to win the award since Bill Bradley at Princeton in 1965 .
Bradley was later a Knicks star , a senator and a presidential candidate .
Other winners have included Pat Haden ( U.S.C. and the Rams ) and Tom McMillen ( Maryland and the N.B.A. and Congress ) .
Rolle ’s quest to the win the Rhodes had received heavy attention from the news media because he chose to risk missing all or part of Florida State ’s pivotal game at Maryland on Saturday night to have the interview , which took place in Birmingham , Ala .
Rolle received the news about 5 p.m. ; he then received a police escort to a local airport , where a private plane waited to take him to the game .
He entered the game late in the second quarter of a 37 - 3 victory .
“ He is flying high , ” Sally Karioth , a Florida State nursing professor who accompanied Rolle to his interview , said before the game .
“ He was hopping .
He ’s usually real sedate . ”

John McCain has essentially claimed he 's savaged Obama because the Illinois senator would n't agree to the series of town hall meetings McCain proposed .
Why McCain is going so negative
It ’s hard to imagine a more unlikely perch for John McCain to be shamed for his increasingly hard - edged and truth - stretching campaign than the middle seat on “ The View . ”
Yet on Friday morning , there sat the Republican nominee — a politician who has built an all but saintly reputation for “ straight talk ” over the years — caught in a vise between Joy Behar and Barbara Walters and getting a lecture from each on honesty .
Advertisement
“ They ’re lies , ” Behar said of two recent lines of attack from the McCain campaign .
“ By the way , you yourself said the same thing about putting lipstick on a pig , ” Walters interjected as a defensive McCain struggled to respond .
The two daytime talk show hosts are hardly alone .
McCain ’s tactics are drawing the scorn of many in the media and organizations tasked with fact - checking the truthfulness of campaigns .
In recent weeks , Team McCain has been described as dishonorable , disingenuous and downright cynical .
A series of ads — including accusations that Barack Obama backed teaching sex education to Illinois kindergartners and charges that Obama called Sarah Palin a lipstick - wearing pig — have provoked a cascade of criticism of McCain ’s tactics .
The furor presents a breathtaking contrast to McCain ’s image as a kind of anti-politician who plays fair , disdains politics as usual and has never forgotten how his 2000 presidential campaign was incinerated by a series of loathsome dirty tricks in the South Carolina primary .
The defense from the candidate himself — heard only on “ The View ” because he has n’t held a news conference in more than a month — is to essentially assert that he ’s savaging Obama because the Illinois senator would n’t agree to the series of town hall meetings McCain proposed at the end of the Democratic primary season .
“ If we had done what I asked Sen . Obama to do , because I ’ve been in a lot of other campaigns where I have appeared with the opposition with the people and listened to their hopes and dreams and aspirations , I do n't think you ’d see the tenor of this campaign , ” he said .
That ’s the candidate ’s public answer — and one that a former adviser suggested that McCain may have convinced himself to believe is true .
Current campaign aides and other Republicans who ’ve closely watched the race , however , have a very different response to the media elites and good - government scolds :
We do n’t care what you think .
McCain seems to have made a choice that many politicians succumb to but that he had always promised to avoid — he appears ready to do whatever it takes to win , even it if soils his reputation .
“ We recognize it ’s not going to be 2000 again , ” McCain spokesman Brian Rogers said , alluding to the media ’s swooning coverage of McCain ’s ill - fated crusade against then - Gov. George W. Bush and the GOP establishment .
“ But he lost then .
We ’re running a campaign to win .
And we ’re not too concerned about what the media filter tries to say about it . ”
Rogers , who hung tough with McCain through the dark days of the primary and has lived through every high and low of this turbulent and unpredictable race , argues that they tried to run a high - ground campaign and sought to keep the candidate in front of the media in the fashion he enjoys .
His point :
No one paid any attention .
“ We ran a different kind of campaign and nobody cared about us .
They did n’t cover John McCain .
So now you ’ve got to be forward - leaning in everything , ” he said .
Rogers concedes that they were understandably overshadowed by the historic Democratic primary through June , but contends that even after the general election began they could get attention only when McCain committed a gaffe .
“ When he ’s sitting in back of a bus and getting questions about Viagra , I think we understand at that point you ’ve got to make some tactical adjustments , ” he said , recalling a particularly awkward gotcha - of - the - day moment on McCain ’s bus in early July .
A senior adviser to the campaign echoed Rogers ’ point : “ Some of the traditional tactics we did for a long time were n’t working , so we adjusted . ”
So instead of doing things the traditional McCain way , they tried out the Steve Schmidt way .
Turning to the playbook of a campaign manager who has been running take - no - prisoners campaigns for years brought immediate changes .
It meant ending McCain ’s anything - goes sessions with reporters on his bus that had become politically untenable in the Internet - and cable news - dominated , 24/7 modern media age .
And it meant embracing , rather than fighting , the notion that Obama was the star of the race .
When the August “ celebrity ” ads cut through the clutter and , for the first time in the campaign , put Obama on defense , McCain aides felt they ’d gotten their answer about whether tougher was smarter .
Similar affirmation came when Obama first suggested McCain would bring race into the campaign — and the Republican side smothered the tactic by countering that it was Obama who was playing the race card .
McCain strategists now have became even more sure of themselves after the picture - perfect reaction — in the GOP ’s view — to the decision to put Palin on the ticket .
The choice provoked derision from elites , jubilation among conservative voters long skeptical of McCain and uncertainty from Obama about how to respond .
If you are a McCain staffer , it does n’t get better than that — so who cares that the candidate had met her only once and her chief foreign policy credential seems to be that she lives closer to Russia than other Americans .
With polls moving in their direction and a unanimous view in the political world that the fundamentals of the race have changed dramatically in the past few weeks , McCain aides are n’t about to drop a flood - the - zone approach that they believe has worked .
“ Most people would have been afraid to have called him out on race , ” boasted an adviser .
“ And we ’re not going to let sexism or denigration of her go unchecked now . ”
On all three counts — their portrayal of Obama as a celebrity , outrage at his purported use of race and his flat - footedness and confusion on how to respond to Palin — McCain aides saw weakness and indecision .
It adds up to a campaign that is now unapologetically aggressive and aimed almost entirely at keeping Obama off - message , even if it means hitting him below the belt in the process .
“ Clearly we intend to stay on offense , ” Rogers said .
“ That ’s what we need to do because the campaign is fundamentally about him .
We feel comfortable about the ads we ’re running and arguments we ’re making . ”
And , given their surge in the polls and Obama ’s uncertainty about how to respond to the Palin phenomenon , they ’re going to keep it up .
“ Every day not talking about the economy , the war and how to fix a broken system is a victory for McCain , ” said John Weaver , a former top strategist to the nominee who left the campaign last year .
“ They ’re going to ride it as long as they can and as long as the mainstream media puts up every ridiculous charge . ”
The negative and often exaggerated or misleading claims being made about Obama and Delaware Sen .
Joe Biden , especially those playing on Palin ’s gender , are just too irresistible for the process - consumed online and cable news media that now drives the campaign conversation , Weaver said .
“ Unless there is a hurricane , they ’re going to cover it , ” he observed .
Added Terry Nelson , McCain ’s former campaign manager : “ It works in part because Obama responds to it . ”
The question now , though , is just how long McCain can keep riding the wave of process and Palin .
“ If they do n’t attack her , she ’s going to go back to being the vice presidential nominee , ” Nelson said of the Democrats .
“ And in the natural scheme of things , the focus will go back to McCain and Obama . ”
At that point , “ the biggest burden for the McCain campaign will be to convey a compelling , positive vision for the country ’s future . ”
A top McCain adviser said they ’re hoping to keep the still - flowing momentum from their convention going as long as they can .
“ But we ’ve always been planning to get back on the economy , jobs and energy , ” said this strategist .
And even if they were n’t , the campaign calendar would demand it .
McCain and Obama face off in three debates , beginning Sept. 26 at the University of Mississippi — events that will force a focus , at least temporarily , on issues rather than pigs and lipstick .

Luckily , a good number of America 's retailers are offering to reward you for exercising democracy with some free goods — coffee galore , chicken fingers and sandwiches , donuts , tacos , you name it .
We 've rounded up a few of the chains you might find on your way back from the polls and what they 're handing out to those who voted , or , in most cases , just say they did .
Read on to get in on deals you might not see for another four years .
Note : Pretty much all of the deals listed below are limited to one per customer , and most rely on that ever - present " participating locations " disclaimer .
We 've included details on how many stores are participating and what they " require " — even though it might be a violation of federal elections law to offer financial enticement for voting .
Of course , proof - showing requirements will vary from store to store ( and amongst over - worked cashiers ) .

We do n't have the will to list every regional chain or vote - friendly store that 's offering a deal or freebie today , but the SlickDeals forum has a pretty nice round - up to check out .
Know of a national or local deal your fellow rights - exercising readers might appreciate ?
Please drop it in the comments , and we 'll update the post with anything that goes beyond region - specific chains .
Now get out there , vote , and enjoy that free lunch of three cups of coffee , donut , chicken sandwich , taco , ice cream , chicken tenders ...
Constraints make us focus .
They force us to zero - in on a specific purpose .
The less material we have to work with , the more resourceful we must be .
Can you sum up your entire outlook on life in one sentence ?
Do you have a personal motto you live your life by ?
How about a maxim that perfectly summarizes your thoughts and beliefs , the very principles and values you uphold and apply on a daily basis ?
‘ You ’ in a Few Words
This is your inner dictum , the adage with which you conduct yourself .
Maybe you unconsciously put it together when you were young by watching a childhood hero , or perhaps you were inspired by someone you knew who struggled and succeeded against all odds .
Whether you call it a slogan , a motto , or a mission sentence , the idea is to use the advantage of constraints to capture ‘ you ’ and all that you stand for in as few words as possible .
What ’s the point ?
To construct a single sentence that embraces your aspirations , values , passions , and purpose .
All these points motivate us .
They shape who we are , the way we live , the choices we make , and the paths we follow .
They are extremely important to know because they impact our lives whether we are aware of them or not .
You have already been living according to your mission sentence even if you did n’t realize it .
You just have n’t consciously defined it yet .
Bear in mind , a mission sentence is worthless if it is n’t true to ‘ you ’ .
It should represent something you are , not something you are n’t , never have been , or never will be .
A Powerful Tool
When you define your mission sentence , you craft a powerful tool for yourself .
You create an abbreviation of all your goals , values , and passions … a guiding symbol of your life ’s story .
It does n’t necessarily have to be a phrase others will understand .
It ’s not for them or for promotional purposes .
It ’s for you .
Remember , words are not actually the things they represent .
You cannot eat the word “ delicious , ” “ Delicious ” is a just word that represents the sweet greatness of a tasty treat .
That ’s what your mission sentence is all about , a clear representation of the greatness that is you .
Look inside yourself .
What ’s your mission sentence ?
As for me , I ’ve lived by the same one for the last decade : “ Trying is my business . ”
Meet Mr Green Genes - the world 's first glow - in - the - dark cat
His eyes glow ghoulishly in the right light , just like any other cat 's - but so do his nostrils , gums and tongue .
Mr Green Genes of New Orleans in the U.S. is the country 's first ' glow in the dark ' ginger tom .
In daylight he looks normal , but put him in a darkened room and switch on an ultraviolet light , and his face will beam out a bright green .
Glowing : Mr Green
Genes glows green under fluorescent light
The six - month - old cat was created by scientists who are trying to combat a range of diseases such as cystic fibrosis .
They modified his DNA to see if a gene could be introduced harmlessly into an animal 's genetic sequence .
To track where the gene went , they decided to use one that glowed under ultraviolet light .
The particular gene in question , known as green fluorescence protein , is likely to express itself in mucous membranes - hence his freakish mouth and ears .
Outlines :
The tabby 's ears , nostrils , eyes and gums glow green the strongest
Betsy Dresser , at the Audubon Centre for Research of Endangered Species in New Orleans , said the gene that was added to Mr Genes has no effect on his health .
She said : ' Cats are ideal for this project because their genetic make - up is similar to that of humans .
' To show that the gene went where it was supposed to go , we settled on one that would glow . '
The long - term goal of this project is to develop what has been dubbed a ' knockout gene ' to combat the cystic fibrosis gene and other diseases .
The fluorescence gene will go alongside the cystic fibrosis gene and make it easier to spot for scientists .
The Nobel Prize in Chemistry was this month awarded to the three scientists who had discovered the glowing gene through working with jellyfish .
Experiment : A special gene was injected into the cat 's DNA using a technique that could help combat genetic diseases

People should tell the exit pollsters , whether from CNN , Edison - Mitofsky , ElectionIntegrity , or whoever , to track BY TYPE OF BALLOT CAST in all states .
This applies with particular strength where voters have choice ( as does n't appear to the be case in PA ) on what type of ballot to vote , because the ballot pools ( paper v. DRE or what have you ) will likely be demographically different .
One consequence : Election night projections do n't necessarily hold because the later - counted ballots will be demographically different than earlier - counted ballots .
It also means that one party , most likely the Republicans but it could be either party , will have a distorted lead based on polling place returns , but that situation will change as other returns come in ....

Hi Brad , I just heard your interview on Democracy Now and your instructions for people to try and take video of any voting machine problems .
I am an election judge in Boulder CO and here at least cell phones are not permitted to be used within the no-electioneering 100 ' limit -- any suggestions on what people should do in these situations ?
Of course , here in Boulder most everyone votes by paper ; each voting location only has one machine , and we 're trained to discourage people from using it !

Leia -
If your cell phone is in your pocket , and your vote flips in front of your face , it would be good to have video of that , as it would be a great service to the nation .
I 'd never advocate breaking any laws ( even if that rule about cell phones likely is n't a law , but a rule ) , but where service to the nation is helpful , I hope folks will do the right thing .
In CA , it 's allowed , as long as one does n't violate someone elses privacy by shooting their ballot .
And it was my cell phone video of my votes being flipped ( 4 out of 12 cast on my ballot ) during last June 's state primary that allowed the Registrar to figure out what had gone wrong .
Transparency is very important .
Hope those thoughts help .

" As we reported when the lawsuit was filed last week , state law allows county clerks to give out paper ballots if just one machine breaks down on Election Day , Cortes ' stunning decree , issued last month went unchallenged by both the DNC or the Barack Obama campaign ... "
It is sad when a judge 's decree that downgrades the previous condition as stated in state law is a victory for democracy .
This is truly Kafkaesque .
What happens when citizens contact their reps about the voting machine issue ?
Do they say nothing ?
Do they all stonewall it as mealy - mouthed Howard Dean did ?
There is Something Rotten In the United States
This smells so rotten , I can smell it here in Canada ( where I just cast a hand - marked paper ballot for a local elextion ) .
Why Do DNC and GOP Alike So Desperately Want to Let the Sleeping Dog Rest ?
Are some dirty rancid secrets festering in the lying dog --- is that why they 're doing their utmost not to arouse it ?
An ex-intelligence officer told me that , based on experiences in the field , that is the likely reason this issue is being stonewalled by the Democratic Party , Republican Party , and the Rovian fascist media in the United States .

Whatever the rules on video are in your state , I do n't see any evidence , in what I 've seen , that there has been the slightest consideration of , much less respect for , the first amendment .
Do n't even get me started on the fact that voters , acting as such , are acting in their sovereign capacity and , subject only to that required for basic order compelled by the awareness of the equal rights of all concerned , can't be ordered what around by the government like the rest of the year .

There are two statutes that MUST be considered ... together they make an important Case for emergency ballot process in PA which should be followed next Tuesday First , as noted , we have a LEGAL statute that states emergency paper ballots MAY be issued if machines inoperable etc
Then add the duties of the Judges of Election ...
PA LAW states that JOE 's must " maintain order " at the polls ( in / out ) which includes line control .
In this election , we have in most counties too few DREs - calculated on overly optimistic and incorrect estimates of capacity .
Worse , many counties used prior election turn - out in calculating need and did not take into account larger turn - out as well as new registrations .
Thus , if one machine goes down for a period of time or at a busy time , the likelihood of long lines forming and some citizens giving up is high .
In fact there were lines in the primary because of one machine down in a number of locations .
What will next Tuesday be like ?
Judges of Election must stand up to their sworn duty to maintain control ... and to their right to request emergency paper ballots if ONE machine is down and it is impacting lines and causing voters to leave .
Put law before a non-elected secretary of state directive - a directive does not rise to level of statute or law .. it is more of a guide .
SOS Cortes has repeatedly made decisions and issued directives which have harmed the voters of PA - including the infamous and misnamed " fleeing voter " which destroys votes if record button not pushed .
Remember many Pennsylvanians are used to levers .
They never had to push a vote record button plus it is easy to miss .
Cortes directed that if voters leaves and does n't push record vote , their entries are to be destroyed .
At least one county wisely ignored this directive and has a process to record while maintaining secrecy and security oversight .
No one should have the right to destroy a vote Mr. Cortes , not even at your direction !
Further , this hides machine problems for in over half the polls we 've examined , the number of sign - in versus machine count do not match .
Excuse ... oh. that 's fleeing voter .
No proof just opinion because of this ill advised directive .
In one very carefully monitored poll in the primary , there were no " fleeing voters " yet the machine count was five under the sign - in number .
Think 5 votes multiplied by all the polls in a township / county / state ...
That can swing many an election and that is just what was n't recorded ... who knows results of programming and other factors impacting the machine figures ?.
Who knows ?
No one !
Or do they ???
Getting back to the above court decision , it is better than all down though best is to make LAW the guide ... make it one down and emergency ballots if needed at that poll .

I volunteer to inspect any code that someones sends me .
Obviously , I cannot verify what machine it came from , but I can shout " fire " if it is obvious that something 's up .

You are inspirational .
Excellent work on both The Al Jazeera English and Democracy Now shows .
I get discouraged , often , by how fucked up things are , occasionally by both candidates ( although Obama 's TV thing tonight was rivetting and tears were streaming down my face ) , and by the lack of support / interest in election integrity from Democrats , Republicans , some of my friends , and the MSM .
But then I regroup and I realize I 'm trying to help with election integrity because it's what I think the vital issue is .
It 's what I ( would be italicizing / underlining the word " I " here and in the preceding sentence if I knew how to ) think the country really needs .
Looks like I 'm gonna get to help in NH with citizen exit polling .
Thanks for the continuing inspiration , babe .

Agree with Adam Fulford :

How about uniformity in the law ?
There should be no necessity for so - called ' emergency ' paper ballots based on whether or not an electronic DRE breaks down .
The fact that even one county of 67 PA counties uses a wholly accessibility - compliant and precinct paper ballot system ( Automark ) and about 6 of 67 use a dual voting system , a mix of paper ballot with optical scanners and the electronic DREs , should be enough for all counties to be legally enabled to provide a choice to the voter of a paper ballot ( with precinct scanners ) .
I 'd argue the precinct scanners are n't needed , the central scanners would be sufficient , but then the precinct paper ballot voter would not have the same opportunity to correct for errors which may disqualify or void the ballot .
It has been puzzling why the lawsuit did not demand such based on equality of voter access to a paper ballot voting system .
But now I 'm wondering about the use of the paper ballots in precincts which will NOT have voter access to a precinct scanner .
As an election judge in a county which employed a dual system for the first time this last Primary , individuals using the paper ballots made errors and they were afforded the opportunity for replacement ballots .
However , that will obviously not be the case in counties which do not have the optical scanners at the precinct .
So an outcome of this ruling could be voters whose ballot may contain disqualifying errors , no equal opportunity to correct for those errors before casting the paper ballot , and the potential for abuse or even mistakes at a central location which scans the paper ballots .
This is potentially more of problem than could ever have been expected .
This is by the way also a problem with the absentee ballots which in PA must be paper ballots .
The absentee voter who inadvertantly over - votes has no equal access to correct for errors .
In addition , with central scanners , the potential exists for stray marks to either be created ( creases in paper ) or to be read as over - votes .
The ballot will then be in the domain of unelected election officials to determine the ' intent ' of a voter outside the sight of the public .
At least with the provisional ballots , which also do not permit for precinct scanning , ( even in precincts with paper ballot / precinct scanners ) , there is a formal review of voter status by elected officials , and before a final decision on that status is made by the Election Board , the provisional ballot voter has an opportunity to testify to one 's eligibility status .
By law , a provisional ballot voter is afforded an opportunity to check the status of the ballot by phone number call and / or site visit .
A special code number is provided the provisional ballot voter .
No such provisions for the EPB voters .
An emergency paper ballot without the precinct scanner who may have a paper ballot disqualified at the central location has NO SUCH OPPORTUNITY for reddress and in fact may not ever know whether or not the ballot was voided for an over - vote !
The voter has of course , ultimate personal responsibility to check a paper ballot before sending it in to the election bureau or putting it into a ballot box at the precinct .
But it appears there is something gravely amiss .
I make these points in the interest of discussion , not discouragement .
Hopefully Mr. Bonifaz will address uniformity and how emergency paper ballots will be treated without precinct - based scanners .

36 states have early voting , why not in PA ?
If voter turnout is really heavy on election day why not allow people to use paper ballots rather than stand in line for hours even if all the machines are working ?
I read were some people GA had to wait up to 12 hrs to cast an early vote .
Is that reasonable ?

Luckily the judge applied common sense and cared more about the voters : " The evidence , not surprisingly , demonstrated that DRE [ direct - recording electronic ] voting machines , like all other machines , sometimes fail .
When that happens , time is of the essence , " Bartle wrote in a 28 - page ruling .
" The polls are open for one day and one day only and then for only 13 hours .
There is no rain date . "
" We would be blind to reality if we did not recognize that many individuals have a limited window of opportunity to go to the polls due to their jobs , child - care and family responsibilities , or other weighty commitments .
Life does not stop on Election Day . "
Bartle was not persuaded by defense arguments that voters could not be provided privacy to vote on paper .
Nor was he persuaded that poll workers lacked the training to administer paper ballots , as election administrators such as Montgomery County 's Joseph A. Passarella testified .

A matador on horseback is one of the most spectacular sights in Spain .
The dramatic face - off between man and beast becomes even more theatrical when the bullfighter confronts his prey from the saddle of a high - stepping thoroughbred , and the figure of the mounted matador – the rejoneador – has been immortalised in vivid ringside sketches by Francisco de Goya .
Anything to do with bulls or horses arouses fierce passions in Spain , but neither the taurine nor the equine world have witnessed anything to match the extraordinary crimes now being tried in a Toledo court .
Three rejoneadores are accused of hiring Colombian hitmen to firebomb a dozen horses belonging to the aristocratic Domecq dynasty .
A long - established Andalusian horse - and cattle - breeding family , as well as the founders of the renowned sherry empire , the Domecqs are doyens of the gentlemanly art of the rejoneo .
The three men on trial are accused of setting fire to 12 of their horses in June 2001 .
Six died instantly , six took years to recover from serious burns .

The arson attack meant the Domecqs ' hugely expensive horses , trained for years to perfect the intricate footwork and elaborate curvetting movements of rejoneo , were unable to take part in 60 mounted bullfights during the 2001 season , resulting in enormous financial losses for the owners and the bullfighters who would have ridden them .
But to complicate the intrigue , the Domecq horses – considered among the finest in Spain – were not the intended target .
The accused – Jose Miguel Callejon Martin , 30 , then a promising young competitor ; his father , Jose Antonio Callejon Amoros , and Manuel Buendía – allegedly contracted three Colombian hired assassins , or sicarios , to destroy horses belonging to another rejoneador – Sergio Galan , an up - and - coming rival .
By a bizarre twist of fate , the Colombians – who vanished after the act and whose whereabouts remain unknown – attacked the wrong horses .
On the day of the crime , Sergio Galan and the Domecq brothers , Luis and Antonio , had all taken part in a horseback bullfight at Las Ventas bullring in Madrid .
When each party set off for home with their horses in trailers , the Colombian hitmen chose the wrong lorry by mistake and followed the Domecq convoy , instead of that of Galan .
On their way home to the family estate in Jerez , the Domecqs stopped for dinner at a roadside inn at Ocana near Toledo .
According to prosectors , the sicarios , seizing their chance , allegedly pushed two petrol bombs through the vents in the horseboxes , which exploded with immediate and deadly effect .
Alerted by the explosions , the lorry driver and stable lads jumped from their dinner table and rushed outside to see the horse - box trailer in flames in the car park .
Only six horses were saved .
Police described the crime as unprecedented in the history of Spanish horseback bullfighting .
Prosecutors say they have tapped telephone conversations incriminating the Callejons – both father and son – in a plot to hire the hitmen .
Additional evidence proves their involvement in the crime , police say .
The Colombians chose a 17 - year - old to throw the firebomb – apparently to protect themselves since Spanish law is considered lenient to minors who commit violent crimes .
But the young man burnt his hand , and had to be taken to hospital to have the wound treated .
His presence in hospital was the first tip - off in a case whose details were eventually pieced together by detectives .
The Domecq family has apparently requested a sentence of three years ' jail for the culprits , plus compensation for the loss of the six horses and through not being able to take part in the 2001 competition season , according to local media reports .
" We are grieved at the memory of such a sad episode for our family ... but are filled with the hope that at last justice will be done .
We hope there will be a conviction , " the Domecq brothers said on the eve of the trial .
The lawyer for the Callejons insists his clients are innocent .
" They did not burn the horses , " he said .
Proceedings have now been adjourned until next April to allow for further investigation .
Rejoneo as a spectacle dates from the Middle Ages , possibly earlier .
Aristocrats on horseback – caballero in Spanish means both " horseman " and " gentleman " – turned the task of herding cattle on their estates with a lance into an art form and a military skill .
They were helped by men on foot , who used capes to lure bulls away from a fallen rider and subdue them with a sword .
As the centuries passed , the plebeians on foot developed their distinctive bullfighting style , and fanbase .
Far from dazzling in a sequinned suit of lights , the matador on horseback wears a functional short , tight jacket and trousers in muted colours , typical of Spanish country riding garb .
The clientele for the two kinds of bullfight also differs , because the skills are different .
Bullfight aficionados watch how the matador confronts the bull , judging his bravery and that of the bull .
Spectators of corridas de rejoneo – less frequent but usually packed events – assess the rider 's command of his horse , his elegance in the saddle and the horse 's skilful footwork .
Sergio Galan – the 28 - year - old who was supposed to have been the target of the original plot – has become a star on the mounted bullfight circuit in the intervening seven years , winning prizes and cutting ears in the smartest bullrings , according to Spain 's bullfighting magazine 6toros6 .
Jose Miguel Callejon , whose alleged spoiling operation against his fast - developing rival so spectacularly misfired , has also consolidated his name , albeit at a lower level .
But if the Domecqs ' court action succeeds , it is doubtful whether Callejon can hold his position in this courteous world of ancient chivalries .
Evolution is n't just for living organisms .
Scientists at the Carnegie Institution have found that the mineral kingdom co-evolved with life , and that up to two thirds of the more than 4,000 known types of minerals on Earth can be directly or indirectly linked to biological activity .
The finding , published in American Mineralogist , could aid scientists in the search for life on other planets .
Robert Hazen and Dominic Papineau of the Carnegie Institution 's Geophysical Laboratory , with six colleagues , reviewed the physical , chemical , and biological processes that gradually transformed about a dozen different primordial minerals in ancient interstellar dust grains to the thousands of mineral species on the present - day Earth .
( Unlike biological species , each mineral species is defined by its characteristic chemical makeup and crystal structure . )
" It 's a different way of looking at minerals from more traditional approaches , " says Hazen .
" Mineral evolution is obviously different from Darwinian evolution — minerals do n't mutate , reproduce or compete like living organisms .
But we found both the variety and relative abundances of minerals have changed dramatically over more than 4.5 billion years of Earth 's history . "
All the chemical elements were present from the start in the Solar Systems ' primordial dust , but they formed comparatively few minerals .
Only after large bodies such as the Sun and planets congealed did there exist the extremes of temperature and pressure required to forge a large diversity of mineral species .
Many elements were also too dispersed in the original dust clouds to be able to solidify into mineral crystals .
As the Solar System took shape through " gravitational clumping " of small , undifferentiated bodies — fragments of which are found today in the form of meteorites — about 60 different minerals made their appearance .
Larger , planet - sized bodies , especially those with volcanic activity and bearing significant amounts of water , could have given rise to several hundred new mineral species .
Mars and Venus , which Hazen and coworkers estimate to have at least 500 different mineral species in their surface rocks , appear to have reached this stage in their mineral evolution .
However , only on Earth — at least in our Solar System — did mineral evolution progress to the next stages .
A key factor was the churning of the planet 's interior by plate tectonics , the process that drives the slow shifting continents and ocean basins over geological time .
Unique to Earth , plate tectonics created new kinds of physical and chemical environments where minerals could form , and thereby boosted mineral diversity to more than a thousand types .
What ultimately had the biggest impact on mineral evolution , however , was the origin of life , approximately 4 billion years ago .
" Of the approximately 4,300 known mineral species on Earth , perhaps two thirds of them are biologically mediated , " says Hazen .
" This is principally a consequence of our oxygen - rich atmosphere , which is a product of photosynthesis by microscopic algae . "
Many important minerals are oxidized weathering products , including ores of iron , copper and many other metals .
Microorganisms and plants also accelerated the production of diverse clay minerals .
In the oceans , the evolution of organisms with shells and mineralized skeletons generated thick layered deposits of minerals such as calcite , which would be rare on a lifeless planet .
" For at least 2.5 billion years , and possibly since the emergence of life , Earth 's mineralogy has evolved in parallel with biology , " says Hazen .
" One implication of this finding is that remote observations of the mineralogy of other moons and planets may provide crucial evidence for biological influences beyond Earth . "
Stanford University geologist Gary Ernst called the study " breathtaking , " saying that " the unique perspective presented in this paper may revolutionize the way Earth scientists regard minerals . "
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Washington does not want to alter a draft security pact with Iraq , despite demands for change from Baghdad where the document failed to win support from Iraqi political leaders , U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates said on Tuesday .

After months of painstaking talks that ended last week , Iraq effectively called for reopening negotiations to address objections to the status of forces agreement ( SOFA ) draft that would require U.S. forces to leave Iraq by the end of 2011 .
But Gates told reporters at the Pentagon that the door to change was “ pretty far closed ” and warned that failure to reach a SOFA deal or renew the U.N. mandate for U.S. troops to remain in the country would mean suspension of U.S. operations .
“ There is great reluctance to engage further in the drafting process , ” the U.S. defense chief said .
“ This is not just kind of a paper exercise .
The consequences of not getting an agreement are very real , ” he added .
“ We basically ( would ) stop doing anything . ”
Objections by Iraqi political leaders appeared to be about details rather than the broad thrust of the pact , which is intended to replace the U.N. mandate that expires December 31 .
“ The cabinet has agreed that necessary amendments to the pact could make it nationally accepted , ” government spokesman Ali al - Dabbagh told Reuters after a cabinet meeting .
“ The cabinet will continue its meetings ( in coming days ) , in which ministers will give their opinions and consult and provide the amendments suggested .
Then this will be given to the American negotiating team . ”
LET IRAQI POLITICS PLAY OUT
Gates dismissed objections from Iraqi politicians , saying differing political opinions in Iraq would likely balance each other out and could lead to progress in the end .
“ We just have to let the Iraqi political process play out , ” Gates said .
The Iraqi announcement on Tuesday was an apparent reversal for Baghdad , which had previously described last week ’s draft as a final text and said as recently as Saturday that it was unlikely to be renegotiated .
The draft would require U.S. troops to leave Iraq after 2011 unless Baghdad asks them to stay and allow Iraqi courts try U.S. military service members accused of serious crimes while off duty .
It would mean that foreign troops , which now operate under a U.N. Security Council mandate , would function for the first time under the authority of the elected government in Baghdad .
Both sides call it a milestone for Iraqi sovereignty .
Some Iraqi politicians have expressed reservations over details such as the mechanism for trying of U.S. troops .
Only Kurdish groups have so far given the text full support .
Humam Hamoudi , a leading member of parliament from the Shi’ite alliance , said that among those voicing doubts in recent days was Prime Minister Nuri al - Maliki , who has yet to speak about the pact in public .
“ The prime minister said : what ( the Americans ) have given with the right hand they have taken away with the left hand , ” Hamoudi told a news conference .

Maliki’s Shi’ite rivals -- followers of cleric Moqtada al - Sadr -- strongly oppose the pact , as does the leadership of mainly Shi’ite Iran , which has influence among Iraqi Shi’ites .
A senior , non-Shi’ite government source said the delay was prompted by Shi’ite politicians under Iranian pressure .
“ It seems there was a ( Shi’ite ) alliance decision to reject it , ” he said .
“ I can only explain these Shi’ite delaying tactics by Iranian pressure .
There ’s no other explanation . ”
Gates said renewing the U.N. mandate was a less attractive option than the SOFA .
It would require a vote by the U.N. Security Council that could draw a veto from Russia .
“ What really needs to happen is for us to get this SOFA done .
It ’s a good agreement .
It ’s good for us .
It ’s good for them .
It really protects Iraqi sovereignty , ” he said .
Iraqi Foreign Minister Hoshiyar Zebari , a member of a Kurdish group that backs the draft , said the pact was unlikely to pass before the U.S. presidential election on November 4 .
SAN ANTONIO , Nov. 25 ( UPI ) --
The U.S. space program says it is undertaking an in - depth , unmanned exploration mission to Jupiter .
The Juno mission will be the first project in which a spacecraft is placed in a polar orbit around the solar system 's largest planet to understand its formation , evolution and structure , NASA officials said Monday .

" Jupiter is the archetype of giant planets in our solar system and formed very early , capturing most of the material left after the sun formed , " said Scott Bolton , Juno principal investigator from the Southwest Research Institute in San Antonio .
" Unlike Earth , Jupiter 's giant mass allowed it to hold onto its original composition , providing us with a way of tracing our solar system 's history . "
The spacecraft is to launch from Florida in August 2011 , and is expected to reach Jupiter in 2016 , the agency said .
The spacecraft is to orbit Jupiter 32 times about 3,000 miles over the planet 's cloud tops for about one year .
The mission will be the first solar - powered spacecraft designed to operate despite the great distance from the sun , Bolton said .
" Jupiter is more than ( 400 million miles ) from the sun or five times further than Earth , " Bolton said .
" Juno is engineered to be extremely energy efficient . "
Mr Dover quit his role as chief whip this summer A Conservative MEP is being expelled from the party after the EU Parliament told him to repay £ 500,000 in expenses paid to his family for office work .
Den Dover , a former chief whip who has denied any wrongdoing , was stripped of the party whip after an EU probe found him guilty of a conflict of interest .
The decision was taken after consultation with leader David Cameron .
The Lib Dems welcomed the move but one Labour MP said the Tories must " forfeit " any cash Mr Dover gave them .
' Significant sum ' Mr Dover , who represents the North West in the European Parliament and is a former MP for Chorley , has said he will repay all the money and has denied breaking any parliamentary rules .
He quit his position as chief whip this summer amid allegations about his conduct .
This is good for the European Parliament and trust in politics .
Chris Davies , Lib Dem MEP
He was accused of paying about £ 750,000 in staff and office allowances to a family owned firm HP Holdings , thus directly benefiting his wife and daughter .
It emerged on Wednesday that an investigation by the secretary general of the European Parliament concluded that Mr Dover 's behaviour had constituted a conflict of interest .
The case has been referred to the European Parliament 's fraud unit .
Philip Bushill - Matthews , the leader of the Conservative Party 's MEPs , said Mr Dover had informed him that he would be required to repay the Parliament a " significant six - figure sum " .
" On the basis of this information and after consulting David Cameron , I have instructed the MEP 's chief whip to withdraw the whip from Mr Dover with immediate effect .
" This , in turn , means that he will not be a Conservative candidate at the European elections in 2009 . "
The conduct of Tory MEPs has been under scrutiny recently after a number of allegations about their use of parliamentary expenses .
The previous leader of the Tories in Brussels , Giles Chichester , quit the role earlier this year amid claims that he had broken expenses rules by paying thousands of pounds in staff allowances to a firm of which he was a paid director .
However , he was subsequently cleared of any wrongdoing by a parliamentary investigation which concluded he had not gained personally from the arrangement nor had it in any way constituted a conflict of interest .
In response , Mr Cameron sent the party 's financial troubleshooter , Hugh Thomas , to Brussels to launch a clean - up of MEP expenses and to bring disclosure requirements into line with those for MPs .
' Welcome action ' Lib Dem MEP Chris Davies , who has lobbied for much tougher action over the abuse of parliamentary expenses , said it was vital that voters had faith in the integrity of their elected representatives .
" The European Parliament 's insistence that money inappropriately used be repaid has been backed up by firm and welcome action by the Conservative Party , " he said .
" This is good for the European Parliament and trust in politics . "
But Labour MP Denis MacShane , a former minister for Europe , said the Tories had to " get their house in order " .
" The Tories must immediately forfeit any money they have received from Den Dover or companies associated with him , " he said .

How to get good search engine rankings « Part 7 : Penalties Part 8 : Black Hat SEO Part 9 : Linking factors »
Google makes it clear that it disapproves of certain SEO tactics , such as hiding keywords with invisible text , or showing one page to Google 's spider and another to actual human visitors .
( See what Google recommends and what they do n't . )
Methods that conform to what the search engines like are called White Hat SEO , and disapproved methods are called Black Hat SEO .
There is a lot of controversy about whether Black Hat SEO is really " bad " in the ethical sense .
White Hatters say that Black Hatters are unfairly trying to manipulate the SERPs .
Black Hatters counter , " What constitutes ' fair ' ?
Is n't any change you make to your page for SEO purposes an attempt to influence rankings ?
Why is one method less pure than another when we 're all just trying to get our pages to rank higher ?
Further , if an engine is ranking a bunch of irrelevant sites above mine , what 's so wrong about using any method at my disposal to get my relevant site ranked above them ?
Doing so does n't benefit just me , it benefits the searchers because it gives them what they 're searching for .
And it also benefits the engine , because searchers will think better of the engine for giving them more relevant results than it would have otherwise . "
Adding to the controversy about Black Hat SEO is the fact Google does allow a certain select few sites to operate contrary to its own stated policies .
Danny Sullivan complains that Google 's cloaking policy is inconsistent ( more on cloaking below ) , and that the policy wording should be updated .
He further notes that the reason Google allows some cloaking is that it improves searching rather than hinders it , and that it 's therefore inappropriate to think of cloaking as synonymous with " bad " .
Personally I think that what 's good or bad is not the methods you use , but whether you 're trying to get a ranking you deserve .
If your site is really one of the best about , say , the history of baseball , then it does n't really matter to me how it gets to the top of the SERPs for a search on that phrase .
What 's annoying to me , and to millions of people around the world , is when a crappy , useless site tricks its way to the top of the SERPs , usually in an attempt to get more visitors to there so they 'll click on the ads there and make money for the webmaster .
So to me it 's not how you get to the top , but whether you should be at the top in the first place .
Whether you think Black Hat SEO is bad or not you should avoid it anway , because it can get you banned from the search engines , or at least reduce your ranking .
Google has been known to remove sites it felt were n't playing fair .
Granted , this is n't likely , but why take that risk ?
Also , much Black Hat SEO involves some fairly technical work .
If this article is your introduction to SEO , you likely do n't have the skills to be a successful Black Hatter anyway -- at least one who does n't get caught .
If you want to stay on Google 's good side , here are some things to avoid : Invisible text .
Do n't put white text on a white background .
In fact , do n't put even very light yellow on a white background .
The engines are n't stupid ; just because the colors are n't exactly the same does n't mean they can't figure out there 's no contrast .
Yes , there are clever ways to try to fool Google about what the background color actually is , but Google is probably aware of most of them anyway , and I wo n't cover them besides .

Cloaking .
Google knows what 's on your site because periodically its automated robot called Googlebot visits all the pages in its index , and grabs all the page content so it can analyze it later .
Cloaking means showing one page to Googlebot and a completely different page to real human visitors .
Google despises this aplenty .

Finding every place to cram your keywords onto your pages -- or worse , including a " paragraph " of nothing but keywords , especially if they 're repeated ad nauseum -- is a big no - no .
Do you consider pages with lists of keywords to be high quality ?
Neither does Google .

Doorway pages .
A doorway page is a page built specifically for the purpose of ranking well in the search engines and without any real content of its own , and which then links to the " real " destination page , or automatically redirects there .
Doorway pages are a popular choice of some SEO firms , although Google has cracked down on this and many webmasters saw their pages disappear from the index .
Some SEO firms call their doorway pages something else , in an effort to fool potential customers who know enough to know that they should avoid doorway pages .
But a doorway page is still a doorway page even if you call it something else .
Some engines may decide that an orphaned page is a doorway page , and if so then the page or the site might suffer a penalty .

Spam .
Spam has a special meaning with regards to SEO : worthless pages with no content , created specifically for the purpose of ranking well in the engines .
You think they have what you 're looking for , but when you get there it 's just a bunch of ads or listings of other sites .
The webmaster is either getting paid by the advertisers , or the page is a doorway page , with the webmaster hoping that you 'll click over to the page s/he really wants you to go to .
Penalties
It 's important to distinguish between the two punishments from search engines since they 're entirely different .
Being banned means your site is removed from the index completely .
This is pretty rare ; most people who think they 've been banned are actually still in the index .
It 's easy to tell whether you 've been banned by Google .
Assuming your site was in the index to begin with , search Google for site:yourdomain.com .
If you get any results , your site has n't been banned .
Being penalized means having your rank reduced .
Unfortunately I know of no way to test for this .
I do think that most of the time a webmaster thinks they 've been penalized they 're wrong .
Rankings change , sites drop -- it 's all part of the way the search engines work .
But often many people take it personally and feel they 're being victimized .
Webmaster World has a good checklist for dealing with a potentially dropped site .

A series of sexually charged allegations over the past year , including a recent claim by a prostitute that Chief U.S. District Judge Edward W. Nottingham Jr. had asked her to mislead judicial investigators about their weekly trysts , prompted Nottingham to resign his lifetime commission Tuesday .
“ He is deeply remorseful for his actions , ” Nottingham ’s lawyer wrote in a public statement that did n’t specify exactly what those actions were or whether any of the publicized anonymous claims are true .
“ He is also embarrassed and ashamed for any loss of confidence caused by those actions and attendant publicity and sincerely apologizes to the public and the judiciary . ”
Nottingham submitted his resignation to President Bush and said it had become clear that leaving the bench was the only way to put the matter behind both him and the court where he had worked for almost 19 years .
The resignation came as Chief Judge Robert Henry of the 10th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals was in the midst of investigating Nottingham for misconduct .
Henry , in a statement of his own , acknowledged for the first time the breadth of the investigation , which began last fall after a complaint arose from testimony in Nottingham ’s divorce case about how he spent thousands of dollars in one night at a Denver strip club .
Since that initial complaint , 9 News has reported that Nottingham ’s name emerged as a client in an investigation of a Denver prostitution ring and that a prostitute had complained to the 10th Circuit that Nottingham had asked her to mislead judicial investigators about their relationship .
The prostitute ’s identity remains secret .
“ The Judicial Council , through its appointed special committees , conducted a thorough and extensive investigation , interviewed many witnesses , considered voluminous documentation and conducted two hearings , ” Henry wrote in a statement issued Tuesday .
“ At this critical time in the investigation of these multiple complaints of misconduct , Judge Nottingham has stepped down , effective immediately , as chief judge of the district of Colorado , has ceased judicial duties and has resigned his commission as a United States district judge effective Wednesday , Oct. 29 , 2008 . ”
Nottingham left the bench last week , turning a drug trial over to another judge , and has not been in court this week .
Jeff Dorschner , spokesman for the U.S. attorney ’s office in Colorado , said he could not comment on whether a criminal investigation into Nottingham ’s conduct is underway .
Nottingham ’s resignation wo n’t have a serious impact on criminal cases pending before the court , though it could result in some minor delays , Dorsch ner said .
A statement from the U.S. District Court for Colorado said that Judge Wiley Y. Daniel would step up to become chief judge , overseeing the operation of the courthouse and the bench .
Daniel becomes the first African - American judge to be appointed chief judge at the U.S. District Court of Colorado .
In the statement on behalf of the court , Nottingham ’s colleagues lauded his leadership , particularly in advancing technology and including electronic courtroom evidence presentation and case filings .
“ Throughout his judicial career , Judge Nottingham worked tirelessly to ensure that his courtroom and case - management practices were premised on the law and applied fairly to all who appeared before him , ” the statement said .
After working as a judicial clerk , private attorney and a federal prosecutor , Nottingham was appointed to the bench Nov. 27 , 1989 , by President George H.W. Bush .
His resignation , which had been rumored since last week , was largely greeted with consternation in the courthouse Tuesday afternoon .
Senior U.S. District Judge John Kane Jr. , a Nottingham friend and one of just a handful of people willing to speak publicly after the resignation was announced , said he would continue to support him .
“ I think now is the time when he needs his friends the most , ” Kane said .
“ He was a hard - working , highly intelligent , dedicated judge .
From what I now know , I think he made the best decision for himself and for the court to resign .
I ’m very saddened .
It ’s the destruction of a highly capable judge .
But the court is an institution , not a group of individuals , and it will survive . ”
Even U.S. Sen. Ken Salazar , who had sought Nottingham ’s resignation , applauded his tenure on Tuesday .
“ On the bench , Chief Judge Edward Nottingham was one of the most skillful lawyers and jurists I have known , ” Salazar said .
“ I am saddened by the allegations and it is right that he resign .
He has done what is in the best interest of the United States District Court for Colorado . ”
Federal judgeships are lifetime appointments .
Judges leave the bench only through resignation , retirement , death or impeachment .
In the past five years , approximately 12 federal judges nationwide have resigned without retiring , none of them in the midst of scandal .
Almost all went into private practice or academia , typically for greater pay than the roughly $ 165,000 that district court judges earn .
Although two new judges were recently appointed by the president and confirmed by the Senate to replace other departed judges in Colorado , Nottingham ’s resignation will leave the local federal bench further shorthanded .
The next president will select a replacement .
Meanwhile ,
Henry suggested that he may have more to say next Wednesday when the resignation becomes official .
A report by an independent investigator hired by the 10th Circuit is said to be complete , though details remain secret .
Staff writer Mike McPhee and researcher Barbara Hudson contributed to this report .

After designing a website similar to that of Barack Obama , Likud Chairman Benjamin Netanyahu has now hired two of the US president - elect 's advisors to help him in his election campaign .
On Thursday the opposition leader finalized the employment of Bill Knapp and Josh Isay , who have worked in recent years with candidates of the Democratic Party in the United States , as well as former President Bill Clinton , Senator Joe Lieberman , New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg and president - elect Obama .
Copycat Netanyahu ?
Is Bibi imitating Obama ?
Adar Shalev Upgraded Netanyahu website suspiciously similar to Barack Obama 's website Is Bibi imitating Obama ?
Israel 's minister for economic affairs in Washington .
Knapp and Isay arrived in Israel several days ago and held a series of meetings with strategists Israel Bachar and Ron Dermer , as well as with Netanyahu himself .
On Thursday the two advisors agreed to work with the former prime minister and to close monitoring his election campaign in Israel .
The Likud chairman has hired American advisors in all of his election campaigns , the most famous one being Arthur Finkelstein , who is now working with Avigdor Lieberman 's Yisrael Beiteinu party .
According to estimates in the political arena , Netanyahu has completed the round of professional appointments for his election campaign .
The two American advisors will join the opposition leader 's team , which includes bureau chief Ari Harow , spokesman Yossi Levy , strategist Roni Rimon , advertiser Shaya Segal and political advisor Shalom Shlomo .
EU turns toward recession amid global financial crisis Agence France - Presse
Published : Monday November 3 , 2008
Print This Email This WASHINGTON ( AFP ) 
New data Monday showed the global financial crisis is pushing the European Union into recession , as South Korea unveiled a stimulus package and automakers reported a terrifying plunge in US vehicle sales .
The European Commission forecast a short but shallow recession for the 27 - nation EU , predicting its combined economy would shrink 0.1 percent in both the third and fourth quarters of 2008 .
" The economic horizon has now significantly darkened as the European Union economy is hit by the financial crisis that deepened during the autumn and is taking a toll on business and consumer confidence , " said EU Economic Affairs Commissioner Joaquin Almunia .
The forecast by the EU 's executive arm also said the economy of the 15 nations that use the euro shrank 0.2 in the second quarter and was set to contract by 0.1 percent in both the third and fourth quarters .
If confirmed , it would be the first time that the eurozone had slumped into recession -- broadly defined as two consecutive quarters of economic contraction -- since the single currency was introduced in 1999 .
In the face of sharply slowing growth , the commission forecast unemployment would return as a major headache after a steady decline in recent years .
It predicted that the unemployment rate in the eurozone would creep up from a low of 7.2 percent in March to 8.7 percent in 2010 .
The impact of the slowdown was highlighted by a year - on - year 7.3 percent fall in new car sales in France , according to official figures for October .

The 2008 Linux Kernel Summit was held September 15 and 16 in Portland , Oregon , immediately prior to the Linux Plumbers Conference .
At this invitation - only meeting , some 80 developers discussed a number of issues relevant to the kernel and its future development .
The following reports were written by Jonathan Corbet , who attended the event and was a member of its program committee .
This reporting was sponsored by LWN 's subscribers ; if you appreciate this kind of content , please consider subscribing to LWN and helping us create more of it .
Day 1
The sessions held on the first day were :
Day 2
Tracing .
A lengthy discussion on user requirements for kernel tracing and how those requirements might eventually be met .
Documentation .
We always want more and better documentation , but what documentation would be most useful to the development community ?
There was a brief bug - fixing session aimed at the top entries on the KernelOops.org .
Over the course of half an hour , the developers were able to fix 13 of the top 14 bugs .
It was widely agreed that this was a productive use of time which will probably be repeated at future events .
More minisummit reports covering virtualization , networking , and kernel bloat .
All about threads ; kernel thread pools and threaded interrupt handlers in particular .
Projects with large user - space components ; how can we make it easier for the direct rendering infrastructure project to work with the mainline kernel ?
Rafael Wysocki led a section on the new suspend / resume infrastructure .
Most of that talk was concerned with the API , which was covered here back in March , so it will not be written up again now .
Some changes will likely be made ; stay tuned to LWN for the details .
Linus did ask the crowd how many people were still unable to suspend their laptops .
The number of hands raised was quite small ; things have clearly gotten better in this area .
Fixing the Kernel Janitors Project .
How can we do a better job of bringing new developers into the kernel community ?
The closing party ( which was also the Linux Plumbers Conference opening party ) was the venue chosen for the annual election of members to the Linux Foundation 's Technical Advisory Board .
The move out of the regular kernel summit sessions was intended to allow a wider group of people to participate in the election .
It would appear to have been successful in that regard ; there were record numbers of both candidates and voters .
The board members elected this time around were James Bottomley , Kristen Carlson Accardi , Chris Mason , Dave Jones , Chris Wright , and Christoph Hellwig .
Christoph was elected to a one - year term ; all of the others will serve two - year terms .
Next year 's kernel summit is currently scheduled for October 18 to 20 in Tokyo , Japan .
Dallas Mavericks owner Mark Cuban is accused of insider trading .
Quick Vote
Which should be the Obama administration 's priority ?
Stimulating the economy
Reducing the budget deficit or View results
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Billionaire entrepreneur Mark Cuban , owner of the National Basketball Association 's Dallas Mavericks , was charged Monday by the Securities and Exchange Commission with insider trading .
The civil suit was filed by the SEC in a federal court in Dallas .
According to the SEC , Cuban sold 600,000 shares of Internet search company Mamma.com in June 2004 using non-public information .
Cuban is accused of calling his broker and instructing him to sell all of his stock from Mamma.com after receiving the confidential information from the company .
The SEC said Cuban learned that the company would raise money through a public offering , and he knew the stock price was about to fall .
When the offering was made public , the stock fell 9.3 % , and Cuban avoided losses in excess of $ 750,000 by selling stock the day before , the SEC report said .
" I am disappointed that the Commission chose to bring this case based upon its Enforcement staff 's win- at - any - cost ambitions , " said Cuban in a statement released by his legal counsel , Dewey & LeBoeuf .
" The staff 's process was result - oriented , facts be damned .
The government 's claims are false and they will be proven to be so . "
An SEC official said Cuban was given the public offering information from Mamma.com in confidence , and Cuban made illegal use of that knowledge .
" As we allege in the complaint , Mamma.com entrusted Mr. Cuban with nonpublic information after he promised to keep the information confidential , " Scott W. Friestad , Deputy Director of the SEC's Division of Enforcement , said in the report .
" Less than four hours later , Mr. Cuban betrayed that trust by placing an order to sell all of his shares . "
Mamma.com has since changed its name to Copernic Technologies ( CNIC ) , and now produces Internet search - advertising services in addition to search software .
Copernic 's stock currently trades for less than $ 1 per share .
According to Phillip Stern , a former SEC attorney and current lawyer at Neal , Gerber & Eisenberg , Cuban will likely face a fine of twice the losses he would have incurred , or about $ 1.5 million .
The SEC 's lawsuit is a civil case , and Cuban does not face any criminal charges .
Stern does not believe Cuban will have to divest his ownership stake in his other companies , including cable network HDNet .
In an ironic twist , Cuban is also the majority owner of Sharesleuth.com , an investigative blog designed to sniff out and expose securities fraud , according to site editor Christopher Carey .
Cuban has been identified as one of the bidders for Major League Baseball 's Chicago Cubs for about a year , after the team was put up for sale by owner Sam Zell , chief executive of the Tribune Co .
But baseball sources told the Chicago - Sun Times last week that Cuban is unlikely to get the league 's blessing despite his deep pockets .
" These allegations really say something about his integrity , " said Stern .
" Baseball was already concerned about him , and now it will be difficult to persuade them otherwise . "
Ayn Rand was a Russian - born American novelist , philosopher , playwright and screenwriter .
She is widely known for her best - selling novels The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged , and for developing a philosophical system called Objectivism .
Rand advocated rational individualism and laissez - faire capitalism , categorically rejecting socialism , altruism , and religion .
Her ideas remain both influential and controversial .

Advertisement Presidential candidate Barack Obama has reached out to US voters in a half - hour , prime - time advertisement on seven US TV channels six days before polling .
The broadcast came as the Democratic senator appeared with former president Bill Clinton at a rally in Florida .
Meanwhile Republican John McCain has launched an attack on Mr Obama 's economic and security abilities .
Mr McCain said he is not qualified to act as commander - in - chief and would raise taxes .
Senator Obama leads in national and most swing - state opinion polls .
' Not perfect ' Mr Obama 's half - hour TV spot was shown on CBS , Fox and NBC , at a cost of about $ 1 m ( £ 630,000 ) per network , as well as on Spanish language channel Univision , BET , MSNBC and TV One .
The advertisement featured interviews with Americans talking about difficulties in their lives , as well as clips of various political and business figures saying why they supported Mr Obama .
Bill Clinton joined Barack Obama on stage at a rally in Florida
It showed footage of Mr Obama on the campaign trail , outlining his policies and talking about his background .
There was no mention of Mr McCain or the Republican Party .
" I will not be a perfect president , " said Mr Obama .
" But I can promise you this - I will always tell you what I think and where I stand . "
The broadcast ended with Mr Obama speaking live from a rally in Florida , where he urged his supporters to continue to campaign on his behalf in the final days before the election .
The BBC's Justin Webb in Washington says that while it is not unheard of for American politicians to buy large chunks of television time - millionaire Ross Perot did it in 1992 - Mr Obama 's move is unprecedented in its scope .
Only one of the major TV networks , ABC , did not run the film - which has been weeks in the making - and Fox News decided not to broadcast its pre-game show ahead of the fifth game of the baseball World Series in order to accommodate it .
' Great threats '
Later on Wednesday , Mr Obama appeared at his first joint rally with former US President Bill Clinton .
The question is whether this is a man who has what it takes to protect America

He told supporters at the Florida rally they should not be complacent but try to persuade their friends and neighbours to vote for Mr Obama .
" We have so much promise and so much peril .
This man should be our president , " said Mr Clinton .
In a speech to supporters in Tampa , Mr McCain had questioned his rival 's security credentials , saying : " The question is whether this is a man who has what it takes to protect America from Osama bin Laden , al - Qaeda and the other great threats in the world . "
" He has given no reason to answer in the affirmative " .
Mr McCain 's assault on his opponent 's defence and security policies came after a meeting with a number of senior former military officials .

Andover law school dean convenes Bush War Crimes Conference Stephen C. Webster
Published : Saturday September 13 , 2008
Print This Email This Update : Massachusetts School of Law dean Lawrence Velvel tells RAW STORY that video of the conference will be available on the Internet by Friday , Sept. 19 , 2008 .
Saturday morning , the dean of Massachusetts School of Law at Andover will convene a two day planning session with a single focus :
To arrest , put to trial and carry out sentence on criminals in the Bush Administration .
The conference , arranged by Lawrence Velvel , cofounder of the Andover school , will focus on which of Bush 's officials and members of Congress could be charged with war crimes .
The plan also calls for " necessary organizational structures " to be established , with the purpose of pursuing the guilty " to the ends of the Earth . "
" For Bush , Richard Cheney , Donald Rumsfeld , and John Yoo to spend years in jail or go to the gallows for their crimes would be a powerful lesson to future American leaders , " Velvel said in a media advisory .
In a published document entitled " The Long Term View " ( PDF link ) , Vevel argues , at the very least , " there is no question " George W. Bush is guilty of conspiracy to commit torture , a war crime .
" He is a former drunk , was a serial failure in business who had to repeatedly be bailed out by daddy 's friends and wanna - be - friends , was unable to speak articulately despite the finest education (s ) that money and influence can buy , has a dislike of reading , so that 100 - page memos have to be boiled down to one page for him , is heedless of facts and evidence , and appears not even to know the meaning of truth , " said Velvel .
The conference will focus on :
# What international and domestic crimes were committed , which facts show crimes under which laws , and what punishments are possible .
# Which high level Executive officials -- and Federal judges and legislators as well , if any -- are chargeable with crimes .
# Which international tribunals , foreign tribunals and domestic tribunals ( if any ) can be used and how to begin cases and / or obtain prosecutions before them .
# The possibility of establishing a Chief Prosecutors Office such as the one at Nuremburg .
# An examination of cases already brought and their outcomes .
# Creating an umbrella Coordinating Committee with representatives from the increasing number of organizations involved in war crimes cases .
# Creating a Center to keep track of and organize compilations of relevant briefs , articles , books , opinions , and facts , etc. , on war crimes and prosecutions of war criminals .
And , addressing the conference will be :
# Famed former Los Angeles prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi , author of the best - selling " The Prosecution of George W. Bush For Murder " ( Vanguard ) .
# Phillippe Sands , Professor of Law and Director of the Centre of International Courts and Tribunals at University College , London .
He is the author of " Torture Team : Rumsfeld 's Memo and the Betrayal of American Values " ( Penguin / Palgrave Macmillan ) , among other works .
# Jordan Paust , Professor of Law at the University of Houston and author of " Beyond The Law . "
# Ann Wright , a former U.S. Army colonel and U.S. Foreign Service official who holds a State Department Award for Heroism and who taught the Geneva Conventions and the Law of Land Warfare at the Special Warfare Center at Ft. Bragg , N.C. She is the coauthor of " Dissent : Voices of Conscience . "
# Peter Weiss , Vice President of the Center For Constitutional Rights , which was recently involved with war crimes complaints filed in Germany and France against former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld and others .
# Benjamin Davis , Associate Professor at the University of Toledo College of Law and former American Legal Counsel for the Secretariat of the International Court of Arbitration .
# David Lindorff , journalist and co-author with Barbara Olshansky of " The Case for Impeachment : Legal Arguments for Removing President George W. Bush from Office " ( St. Martins Press ) .
# Colleen Costello of Human Rights USA .
# Christopher Pyle , a professor at Mt. Holyoke and author of several book on international matters .
# Lawrence Velvel , a leader in the field of law school education reform , who has written numerous internet articles on issues relevant to the conference .
Watch the Bush War Crimes Conference on Saturday , 9 a.m. EST - 5:15 p.m. , and Sunday 9 a.m. - 2:30 p.m. EST . in the embedded video below .
Live video by Ustream
You are watching a lot more video on the Internet , and you may start to pay your Internet provider more for it .
That was one of the conclusions I walked away with after spending Friday at the annual seminar of the Columbia Institute for Tele - Information at the business school of Columbia University .
The theme was “ The Dawning of the Ultra - Broadband Era , ” and it explored the implications of Internet service that is far faster than the current offerings over phone wires , cable and wireless connections .
One theme from the academics , telecom executives and regulators from around the world in attendance was that demand for data over broadband is rising fast .
Less clear is whether the supply of bandwidth is rising as fast as demand , and thus whether prices will go up or down for consumers .
Here are some of the more interesting exchanges :
File sharing has been usurped by legitimate video services .
Peer - to - peer networks , which are often used to trade illegal copies of music and movies , no longer generate the largest share of Internet traffic in the United States .
In a busy hour on AT&T ’s network , 31 percent of the bandwidth is used by streaming audio and video , said David Belanger , the chief scientist of AT&T Labs .
Other sorts of Web pages represent an even greater share .
( The slide he displayed did n’t have a caption , but it looked like the Web traffic was about 40 percent of the pie chart , and the P2P segment about 20 percent .
I ’ve e-mailed AT&T and I ’ll update with the exact numbers if they give them to me . )
“ Four years ago , peer - to - peer traffic would have been the largest slice of the pie , ” Mr. Belanger said .
“ The Web has overwhelmed P2P , ” he said , and audio and video streams are now larger as well .
Web pages and video are increasing at a pace of 76 percent a year , far faster than the overall 30 percent growth in bandwidth use per household served by AT&T .
In Germany , the trend is similar , but not quite as advanced , according to data presented by Matthias Kurth , the president of the Bundesnetzagentur , the German utility regulator .
This year , peer - to - peer file trading is the largest component of Internet traffic .
But by 2012 , if current trends continue , Internet - delivered video will use more than half of the bandwidth to homes .
The very heaviest users drive up network costs .
This surging use of bandwidth is requiring networks to expand their capacity .
In the days of Ma Bell , the cost of the phone network was determined by how many lines were needed to handle the calls on Mother ’s Day .
And in broadband networks , the biggest costs come from building the various network nodes and connections to handle peak usage .
This is even more true in wireless networks .
In New York City , for example , T - Mobile has had to add more than 1,000 cell sites , at a cost of $ 200,000 each , simply because its existing sites reached capacity , said Joe Mallahan , its vice president of corporate strategy .
And on data networks , a very small number of users account for a disproportionate amount of the bandwidth consumption .
Robert Pepper , a senior managing director of Cisco for technology policy , presented figures that cited statistics from Japan , which has much faster broadband service than the United States .
The top 1 percent of users consumed 225 gigabytes of data a month , compared to the bottom 50 percent of users who used 1 gigabyte of data or less .
Unlimited data plans may have a limited life .
Several executives from telecommunications companies argued that that this surge in data use , and the disproportionate nature of who uses it , would require an end to plans that offer unlimited data use .
“ We have light users subsidizing heavy users , ” said Maggie Wilderotter , the chief executive of Frontier Communications , a regional phone company .
“ We have to move to a model of consumption - based pricing . ”
In an interview after her talk , Ms. Wilderotter said Frontier was going to start displaying to customers a gauge that shows how much bandwidth they are using .
Then it will start imposing an additional fee for customers who use more than 5 gigabytes of data a month .
T- Mobile ’s wireless operation in the United States is looking to do the same thing , said Mr. Mallahan .
“ It ’s crazy , ” he said .
“ People who want moderate usage have to pay way too high prices . ”
Right now he said , wireless carriers do n’t really offer truly unlimited plans because they cancel the accounts of the very heaviest users .
“ Every one of the wireless carriers fires high - use data customers , ” Mr. Mallahan said .
He suggested that wireless data services offer a certain amount of bandwidth , with a “ moderate ” charge for additional use .
“ In voice , our overage charges are exorbitant , ” he said .
“ It ’s a legacy thing we ’re addicted to . ”
It ’s cheaper in Europe .
Broadband products and prices differ wildly around the world .
The conference did n’t have anyone speaking from Asia , which is enjoying a flood of bandwidth .
But several people from Europe discussed the broadband services available there at price points that are far better than those in the United States .
In Germany , for example , a bundle of voice and high - speed data service can cost 30 euros ( $ 38 ) , said Mr. Kurth , the German regulator .
In many countries the relative savings is even more for people who use pay - television services delivered over their Internet connections .
Deutche Telekom , for example , offers a bundle that includes 150 channels of pay TV , video on demand , data service and voice calling .
The cost is 60 euros ( $ 76 ) a month .
( Cable and phone companies are offering teaser rates of about $ 99 a month for this bundle in the United States , but the regular price is often $ 130 a month or more . )
( Newser ) – Scientists have succeeded in blanking selected memories from the brains of mice , Reuters reports .
After brain protein levels were manipulated , the mice lost the memory of an electric shock but did n't forget anything else .
The researchers said it was doubtful that it would be possible — or desirable — to do the same with the vastly more complex human brain .
" All memories , including the painful emotional memories , have their purposes , ” said the lead researcher , whose work is published in the journal Neuron .
" We learn great lessons from those memories or experiences so we can avoid making the same kinds of mistakes again . ”
Still , he added , he would n't be surprised if human memory wipes were developed in his lifetime .

Voice of Egypt is ashamed of Egyptian Lawyer Nagla Al Imam , the same lawyer who made Egyptians angry , for encouraging Arab men to sexually harass Israeli women during her interview on Al Arabia TV ( Ar ) .
The Egyptian blog says :
نجلاء الإمام المحامية و رئيسة جمعية لحقوق الإنسان تدعو الشباب العربي للتحرش بالإسرائيليات و اغتصابهم كنوع من المقاومة و بعد كده بنتسائل ليه الغرب بيتهمنا بالتخلف و الإرهاب أما تكون دي رئيسة جمعية لحقوق الإنسان هيفتكروا المواطن العادي شكله عامل ازاي؟ ؟
Nagla Al Imam , a lawyer and head of a human rights organization , invited Arab youth to sexually harass and rape Israeli women as a form of resistance … and then we wonder why the West accuses us of backwardness and terrorism … if this is how the head of an NGO thinks , then what would an average citizen be like ?
An Israeli blog , My Right Word , posted excerpts of the interview in English :
I have tried to have a psychological comparison of the users at digg and those at reddit .
These comparison are based on the stories submitted and comments by the users .
At first have a look at the level of Reddit users .
Many among the Reddit users are school kids
On the contrary , digg has most of its users as office workers or mature bloggers .
Similarly , each has its own way of expressing differnce of opinion .
Finally , the thought process is entirely different .
Have a look at the comments by reddit users and those by digg users .
I had always liked Digg because of its interface and the quality of news stories and because of the fact that i got my first two or three submissions popular .
While reddit on the other hand was not a successful thing for me as i never even got more than one point on my submissions .
Generally speaking , the news at reddit were more raw and simple .
The voting system at reddit is simply the simplest , you can not get it more simpler .
On the contrary , digg is slightly more biased and spammed .
If you disagree then have the luxury to comment .

WASHINGTON  Private health insurance plans , which serve nearly a fourth of all Medicare beneficiaries , have increased the cost and complexity of the program without any evidence of improving care , researchers say in studies to be published Monday .
The studies , questioning the value of some private plans for Medicare beneficiaries and taxpayers , were issued as President - elect Barack Obama and Congressional Democrats take aim at the plans and consider cutting the payments they receive .
Enrollment in private Medicare plans has nearly doubled in five years , to 10.1 million .
In one study , Marsha Gold , a senior fellow at Mathematica Policy Research , says that private Medicare Advantage plans “ are now widely available nationwide , ” even in rural areas , as Congress intended when it revamped the program in 2003 .
But the study , to be published in the journal Health Affairs , says that 48 percent of the additional enrollment comes from a type of plan that mimics traditional Medicare and generally does little to coordinate care .
Enrollment in these “ private fee - for - service plans ” has shot up to 2.3 million , from 26,000 in December 2003 .
Seventeen years ago , Ken Imhoff watched Cannonball Run and became so enamored with the Lamborghini Countach in the film , he hand - built his own , in his basement .
In what we imagine might be the most Jalopnik build ever undertaken , Ken designed and fabricated his own tig - welded frame , installed a thoroughly massaged 351 cubic inch V8 with a ZF - 25 5 - speed transmission , hand - formed the aluminum body over a meticulously measured and accurate body form , and finished it all off in a beautiful metallic gray .
It took Ken 10 years to complete the project , and the results — as you can see both in the gallery and in the video below the jump — are amazing .
There 's only one problem , when you build a car in a basement — how do you get it out ?
Find out below .
Ken went into the project fully aware of the problem of a getting the car out of his basement — it was your classic ship - in - a - bottle project problem .
When the faux Lambo was complete , he actually hired a contractor to knock out a part of the basement wall , build an earthen ramp , and then drag the car out of its subterranean workshop .
Firing It Up In The Basement , You Gotta Love It Mr. Imhoff , our hats are off to you sir .
You are an inspiration to us all , we want to be like you when we grow up .
Considering the quality of the work here , we 're fairly confident your car is actually better than factory , more reliable , better handling and faster , and you have the satisfaction of having built it yourself .
Congratulations sir , you are a grease monkey superhero .

But there 's one room at the very top of the house that has always been forbidden , and the more lee - way you are given elsewhere , the more stringently that rule is enforced .
In the end , they say , " You can go anywhere and do anything - apart from that room . "
And you accept this , because they seem so intent on it .
And you love them .
But you keep wondering : why that room ?
What is up there ?
What am I not allowed to experience or to see ?
And one day , you get up your courage and you wait till the adults are out and you gingerly make your way to that room you have never been in before .
And you go in , and look around , with some awe and burning curiosity .
And you look in the cupboards and the drawers and under the chairs , and finally you find , in one dusty old desk , what they never wanted you to find .
You find the legal papers , the deed , that proves that they own the house .
And you do n't .
However long you live , whatever you do , however you conduct yourself , this house will never be yours .
You can live in it - with their permission , and under their authority .
It is your home , because where else were you born and where else would you live - but only to rent , never to own .
It is your family , but you are always kept one critical step away from being fully part of it .
There is one fine line you will never be allowed to cross .
It is your country , but you are never fully a citizen .
You can live here , but you can't vote .
Your parents can die here , but you will never inherit this house .
We want to be citizens .
We want to be a full and equal part of our own homes and our own families and our own lives .
And some of us , having been in that room for a short while , know what it feels like .
And we will never , ever let it go .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Samsung has started producing 256GB ( SSDs ) for notebooks and Desktop PCs .
With a high speed drive up to sequential read rates of 220 MB/s , sequential write rates of 200MB /s and the delete rates of 100 GB / s. it offers now SSDs in 8 Gb , 16GB and 23 Gb for small designs and 64GB , 128GB and 256GB for the higher densities .
Sequential data transfers occur when PCs are booted or large files are copied , for example , Wong said .
However , because most PC tasks are random rather than sequential it makes more sense to use random performance as a measure , Wong said , adding that random performance tends to suffer if the SSD is set up to measure sequential performance .
Samsung could n’t immediately provide the measurements of the SSD ’s random read and write cycle
Jim Elliott , vice president , Samsung Semiconductor , is using 256GB SSD in a notebook which is simillar to have a 15,000 rpm drive .
The company said .
It can store 25 high - definition movies in just 21 minutes !

Piracy is a lucrative business with huge ransoms demanded India says it will send warships to the Gulf of Aden to protect its container vessels from pirates operating off the coast of Somalia .
A defence official said one warship would be deployed immediately and that the number could be increased later .
The announcement coincided with protests by families of 18 Indian sailors who have been held captive on a ship by Somali pirates since August .
There has been a recent surge in piracy off the coast of Somalia .
Somalia has not had a functioning national government since 1991 and has suffered continuing civil strife .
Warships from several countries are already patrolling the Gulf of Aden , which connects the Red Sea and the Indian Ocean , and is one of the world 's busiest shipping lanes .
Negotiations Eighteen of the 22 crew on the Japanese - owned merchant vessel held since August are Indian .
The wife of the captain told the BBC that she had been told that India would not be sending in naval warships immediately .
They are telling us that it takes about six to eight weeks to negotiate with the pirates
Seema Goyal , wife of the captain of highjacked ship
Life in Somalia 's pirate town Somalia : Special report Somali piracy costs $ 30 m Seema Goyal , who has been spearheading the protests by families of crew members , said : " I was told by federal shipping authorities that the warships would be send only after the resolution of the hijacking of this ship . "
She said the owners of the vessel had told the families of the crew that " negotiations with the pirates were in progress " .
" They are telling us that it takes about six to eight weeks to negotiate with the pirates .
We are already into the fifth week after the hijacking took place .
I really do n't know where we stand , " she said .
Piracy off the coast of Somalia is estimated to have cost up to $ 30 m ( £ 17 m ) in ransoms so far this year , according to a recent report by a UK think tank .
The Nato military alliance recently said it would send warships to help combat piracy off the coast of Somalia .

What are these ?
Python seems to keep growing on me .
By no means am I a Python master , nor am I a vim guru but I do prefer to use vim over a gui editor .
Sure there are some niceties with using a gui but getting comfortable using a tool that is almost always at your disposal has something to be said for it .
Adding a few things to your vim environment will make writing python much more pleasurable .
First there is the python indent plugin .
At the time of this writing the current version is 0.3 .
There is one annoying thing about it .
When commenting with hashes it un-indents .
Luckily Henry Prêcheu pointed out that its an easy one line fix .
setlocal indentkeys=!^F , o , O , <:>,0 ) , 0],0} , =elif , =except
should be changed to .
setlocal indentkeys=!^F , o , O , <:>,0 ) , 0],0} , =elif , =except,0 #
Here is the full updated version of the script .
Vim Python Indent 0.4_alpha1
Syntax Highlighting
Download http://www.vim.org/scripts/script.php?script_id=790 at the time of this writing the current version is 2.6.3 .
and place it in your .vim / syntax / directory ( if its not there you should create it ) .
This will add awesome highlighting to your python files .
But we can make it better !
We can add some simple error checking for things like missing colons .
These are the additions that I have added which I found provided by sontek aka John M. Anderson .
Do n’t forget to add syntax on to your .vimrc .
syn match pythonError " ^\s*def\s\+\w\ +(.*) \s*$ " display syn match pythonError " ^\s*class\s\+\w\+(.*) \s*$ " display syn match pythonError " ^\s*for\s . * [ ^ : ] $ " display syn match pythonError " ^\s*except\s * $ " display syn match pythonError " ^\s*finally\s * $ " display syn match pythonError " ^\s*try\s * $ " display syn match pythonError " ^\s*else\s * $ " display syn match pythonError " ^\s*else\s * [ ^ : ].* " display syn match pythonError " ^\s*if\s . *[ ^\ : ] $ " display syn match pythonError " ^\s*except\s . *[ ^\ : ] $ " display syn match pythonError " [ ; ] $ " display syn keyword pythonError do
We can take that a step further with the following additions to your .vimrc .
" Syntax checking entire file " Usage : : make ( check file ) " : clist ( view list of errors ) " : cn , : cp ( move around list of errors ) autocmd BufRead *. py set makeprg=python\ - c\ \ " import \ py_compile , sys ; \ sys.stderr=sys.stdout ;\ py_compile.compile(r ' % ' ) \ " autocmd BufRead *. py set efm=%C\ %. %# , %A\ \ File\ \ " %f \ " \\ , \ line \ % l % . % # , %Z % [ %^\ ] %\\@=%m
This will allow you to check the syntax ofyour entire file by typing : make .
you can the get a list of errors with : clist and move between the errors with : cn and : cp .
Execute block of code
Sometimes you want to check or execute a block of code .
Drop the python execute block vim script into your .vim / ftplugin/ directory .
With it you can visually select a block of code and execute it with Ctrl+h .
Debugging
So you are finding errors in your code and want to trace them ?
Drop this python ipdb vim script into your .vim/ftplugin/directory .
You can set break points with F7 and clear them with shift - F7 .
If your not familiar with ipdb you should look it up .
While we ’re at it lets add an easy way to run your current script .
map :!
python %
It was pointed out by fboender on reddit that there is a better way to do this .
Download the bexec plugin open it with vim using the full path to your vimball and then type : so % to source and install the vimball .
Now setup some maps for it .
nmap < silent > < unique > < F8 > : call Bexec ( ) < cr > vmap < silent > < unique > < F8 > : call BexecVisual ( ) < cr > map < silent > < unique < F9 > : call BexecCloseOut ( ) < cr >
in your .vimrc will cause F8 to run the file you currently have open .
Tabs
Who does n’t love tabs ?
You can have them in vim too ya know !
Add these lines to your .vimrc
map \t : tabnew < cr > map
: tabnext <cr > map \p : tabprevious <cr > map \c : tabclose<cr >
With these additions you can open a new tab with \t move right with
and move left with \p .
To close the tab simply enter \c .
Edit File Menu
You can add a handy menu when opening files with :e .
Its called the wildmenu .
Add the following lines to your .vimrc .
As a side note it will also give completion options for vim commands .
set wildmenu set wildignore +=*.pyc,*.zip,*.gz,*.bz,*.tar,*.jpg,*.png,*.gif,*.avi,*.wmv,*.ogg,*.mp3,*.mov
Code Snippets
The vim snippy plugin provides textmate like code snippets .
Its pretty darn cool .
Installing is hard .
Download the latest version from here .
Be sure to download both snippy_plugin.vba and snippy_bundles.vba as the plugin and snippets are now seperated .
Create a directory .vim / after / ftplugin and put both .vba files in there .
I installed them by opening them with vim using the full path to the .vba files and then typing : source % to source the file .
The vim ball script will install and you will be ready to go .
Open a .py file and type def .
You can tab through each < {} > and fill in the content to construct your function .
Extra functional goodness like block comment
Operating on blocks of code is handy .
Being able to comment out an entire section with a few keystrokes saves much time .
This vim script provides that functionality .
I download it and save it to .vim/ftplugin/python_fn.vim .
Then you can visually select a block of code with ] v and comment it out with ]c and move its indentation level with ]< and ] > as well as a few other things .
PEP8 Goodness
Adding the following to .vim/ftplugin/python_pep8.vim will help you with tab space and other such worries with pep8 .
setlocal tabstop=4 setlocal softtabstop=4 setlocal shiftwidth=4 setlocal textwidth=79 setlocal smarttab setlocal expandtab setlocal smartindent
One last note
Make sure indent and plugins are turned on in your .vimrc
filetype plugin indent on
In forwarding a résumé in 2006 from a lawyer who was working for the Federalist Society , Ms. Goodling sent an e-mail message to the head of the Office of Legal Counsel , Steven Bradbury , saying : “ Am attaching a résumé for a young , conservative female lawyer . ”
Ms. Goodling interviewed the woman and wrote in her notes such phrases as “ pro-God in public life , ” and “ pro-marriage , anti-civil union . ”
The woman was eventually hired as a career prosecutor .
Such consideration of political views would have been allowed in hiring candidates to political appointments , which make up a tiny part of the Justice Department ’s 110,000 employees , but it was clearly banned under both Civil Service law and the Justice Department ’s internal policies , the inspector general said .
The problem appears to have predated Ms. Goodling ’s rise at the Justice Department .
In one episode cited in 2004 , when John Ashcroft was attorney general , Ms. Goodling ’s predecessor as White House liaison , Susan Richmond , blocked the deputy attorney general ’s office from extending the stint of one lawyer because she felt that the job should be filled by a political appointee loyal to Mr. Bush , the report said .
Stuart Levey , an aide in the deputy attorney general ’s office , summed up his frustration in an e-mail message recounting his inability to keep the lawyer in his office .
“ I also probed whether there is something negative about him that I did not know , ” Mr. Levey wrote .
“ Turns out there is : he is a registered Democrat , ” he wrote , and Jan Williams , an official in the White House , “ thinks everyone in the leadership offices should have some demonstrated loyalty to the President .
She all but said that he should pack his bags and get out of Dodge by sunset . ”
Such political consideration grew even more rampant when Ms. Goodling became White House liason in 2006 .
Ms. Goodling , with the apparent backing of Mr. Gonzales ’ office , was able to override the wishes and recommendations of more experienced officials who far outranked her on paper .
And her political influence in hiring decisions became so well known within the department that it generated complaints from senior officials who believed it was improper , long before the issue became a public controversy in 2007 following the firings of nine United States attorneys .
The inspector general concluded that Ms. Goodling knew that questioning applicants to career positions about their political beliefs was improper .
In one case , for instance , Ms. Goodling slowed the hiring of a prosecutor in the United States attorney ’s office in Washington D.C. for a vacancy because she said she was concerned that he was a “ liberal Democrat . ”
After the United States attorney , Jeffrey Taylor , complained to her supervisors , he was allowed to hire the candidate anyway .
In another case , colleagues said that Ms. Goodling blocked the appointment of a female prosecutor in Washington because she believed the lawyer was involved in a lesbian relationship with her supervisor , according to the report .
Ms. Goodling had heard unfounded rumors that the lawyer , Leslie Hagan , was having a relationship with her boss , Margaret Chiara , who was the United States attorney for the western district of Michigan , according to Ms. Hagan ’s lawyer .
Ms. Chiara was one of the nine United States attorneys fired from their posts for reasons that were never made clear to them .
Some officials suggested that Ms. Chiara ’s link to the case and Ms. Goodling ’s objections may now explain her abrupt dismissal .
“ There was no romantic relationship , ” said Lisa Banks , the attorney for Ms. Hagan , “ but the rumors were pernicious and grew legs , and it cost her the job . ”
[ This article is available in Spanish : ` Que paguen los pobres del mundo La crisis económica y del Sur del glob ' . ]
By Adam Hanieh
November 22 , 2008 --
The current global economic crisis has all the earmarks of an epoch - defining event .
Mainstream economists – not usually known for their exaggerated language – now openly employ phrases like ``systemic meltdown '' and ``peering into the abyss ' ' .
On October 29 , for example , Martin Wolf , one of the top financial commentators of the Financial Times , warned that the crisis portends “ mass bankruptcy ” , “ soaring unemployment ” and a “ catastrophe ” that threatens “ the legitimacy of the open market economy itself ... the danger remains huge and time is short ” .
There is little doubt that this crisis is already having a devastating impact on heavily indebted American households .
But one of the striking characteristics of analysis to date – by both the left and the mainstream media – is the almost exclusive focus on the wealthy countries of North America , Europe and East Asia .
From foreclosures in California to the bankruptcy of Iceland , the impact of financial collapse is rarely examined beyond the advanced capitalist core .
The pattern of capitalist crisis over the last fifty years should alert us to the dangers of this approach .
Throughout its history , capitalism has functioned through geographical displacement of crisis – attempting to offload the worst impacts onto those outside the core .
This article presents a short survey of what this crisis might mean for the Global South .
World trade drops
This crisis hits a world economy that – for the first time in history – is truly global .
Of course exports and the control of raw materials have always been important to capitalism .
But up until the 1970s most capitalist production was organised nationally .
Throughout the 1980s and 1990s both production and consumption began to be organised at the international scale .
Today , all markets are dominated by a handful of large companies operating internationally through interconnected chains of production , sub - contracting and marketing .
Almost every product we consume has involved the labour of thousands of people scattered across the globe – from the production of raw material inputs , research and development ( R&D ) , assembly , transport , marketing and financing .
At one level this interconnectedness of production expresses the fact that human beings have become one social organism .
At the same time , it continually runs up against a system organised for the pursuit of individual , private profit .
This interconnectedness has taken a very particular form over the last couple of decades .
The world market has been structured around the consumption of the US ( and , to a lesser extent , European ) consumer .
Goods produced in low - wage production zones such as China and India – using raw materials mostly sourced from other countries in the South – are exported to the US where they ended up in the ever expanding homes of an overly indebted consumer .
Control of this global chain of production and consumption rests in the hands of large US , European and Japanese conglomerates .
This structure helped to fracture and roll - back national development projects across the globe .
Coupled with the debt crisis of the 1980s , export - oriented models of development were imposed by the International Monetary Fund and other financial institutions on most countries in the South .
Many of the elites of these countries bought into this development model as they gained ownership stakes in newly privatised companies and access to markets in the Global North .
The ever - expanding consumption of the US market was predicated on a massive rise in indebtedness .
US consumers were encouraged to take on vast levels of debt ( through credit cards , mortgages , ``zero - down '' financing , etc. ) in order to maintain the consumption levels that underpinned global demand .
The dollars that enabled this growth in debt came from financial instruments that were purchased by Asian central banks and others around the world .
These institutions lent dollars back to the US where they were channeled to consumers through banks and other mechanisms .
The US real estate market was just one of the financial bubbles that permitted this treadmill of increasing indebtedness to continue .
People could continually refinance their mortgages as real estate prices went up .
But with the collapse of this bubble global world demand is suddenly drying up .
Because of the interconnectedness of world trade , this will have a very severe impact on every country across the globe , particularly in the South .
One measure of this is shown by a relatively obscure economic indicator , the Baltic Dry Index ( BDI ) .
The BDI measures the cost of long - distance shipping for commodities such as coal , iron ore and steel .
From June–November 2008 , the BDI fell by 92 % , with rental rates for large cargo ships dropping from $ 234,000 a day to $ 7340 .
This massive drop reflects two factors : the reduction in world demand for raw materials and other commodities , and the inability of shippers to have their payments guaranteed by banks because of the credit crisis .
Falling commodity prices also demonstrate this drop - off in world trade .
Copper prices , for example , have fallen 23 per cent in the past two months .
Chinese consumption of the metal , critical to much industrial production , has fallen by more than half this year .
ArcelorMittal , the world 's largest steelmaker , stated on November 5 that its global output would decline by more than 30 per cent .
The World Bank ( which has consistently underestimated the severity of the current downturn ) is now predicting global trade volumes to shrink for the first time since 1982 .
Social dislocation
This drop in world trade will have a particularly devastating impact on those countries that have adopted ``export - oriented '' models of development .
This model was heavily promoted by the World Bank , the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) and most economists over the last couple of decades .
As global demand shrinks , countries reliant on exports will be faced with collapse of their core industries and potential mass unemployment .
This will place further pressure on wages as new labour reserves augment already large levels of unemployment .
Standard and Chartered estimate , for example , that Chinese exports could tumble to “ zero or even negative growth ” in 2009 .
JP Morgan Chase is predicting that Chinese exports will fall 5.7 per cent for every one percent drop in global economic growth .
This is not just a matter of getting by on smaller levels of still positive growth .
China needs to create 17 million jobs a year in order to deal with the large numbers of farmers moving from the countryside to urban areas .
This means that the country must maintain high rates of growth .
Even if growth drops from 11 - 12 % annually to 8 % the country faces potentially huge social dislocation .
Already , workers in China are protesting in the millions as their factories close and owners abscond with unpaid wages .
A collapse in world trade is not the only potentially devastating threat this crisis presents to the global periphery .
Like the 1997 Asian economic crisis , the rapid withdrawal of foreign funds from stock markets and other investments in the South could cause the meltdown of currencies and the collapse of industries already reeling from slowdowns in trade .
A quick survey of a few countries demonstrates the deadly mix of capital outflows , high inflation and drops in export earnings :
In Pakistan , foreign - currency reserves have dropped more than 74 per cent in the past year to about US $ 4.3 - billion .
The country is teetering on the edge of total collapse and urgently requires $ 6 billion in order to pay for imports and service its existing debt .
The dire situation of foreign outflows led the German foreign minister to state on October 28 that the “ world has just six days to save Pakistan ” ( at the time of writing it looks like Pakistan will get this money in the form of loans from the IMF and / or countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council ) .
Sri Lanka has lost nearly 25 % of its foreign reserves since the beginning of August as foreign investors repatriate their dollar holdings from the country .
Nearly 50 per cent of Sri Lanka 's textile and garments exports ( accounting for some 43 per cent of total foreign exchange earnings ) went to the US in 2007 , while another 45 per cent went to the EU .
These exports will likely be decimated by a generalised collapse in demand .
The weakening of the Sri Lankan rupee over the last few years has contributed to a 20 % increase in inflation , with high food prices hitting the poorest most heavily .
India has seen its foreign exchange reserves drop by 17 per cent since March 2008 .
Over $ 51 billion left India during the third week of October , the largest fall in eight years .
The Indian textile industry , which makes up the second largest component of the country 's labour force after agriculture , exports 70 % of its product to U.S. and European markets .
It is expected that textile and garment orders will decline by at least 25 % over winter and mass layoffs have already begun .
On October 29 , the Association of Chambers of Commerce and Industries predicted that companies in seven key industries ( steel , cement , finance , construction , real estate , aviation and information technology ) would need to cut 25 % of their workforce .
This at a time when the country struggles with an immense gap between rich and poor .
The wealth of the richest 53 people in India is equivalent to 31 percent of the country 's GDP , yet according to the World Bank 42 % of the population lives below the official poverty line of $ 1.25 a day .
These patterns are repeated across the globe .
Countries including Mexico , Turkey , Indonesia , Brazil , Argentina , South Korea as well as the poorer countries of eastern and southern Europe are faced with collapsing growth rates , capital flight and declines in the value of their currency .
In many cases , these problems have been exacerbated due to a proliferation of low - interest loans taken by individuals and companies that were denominated in foreign currency ( such as Swiss francs , euros and dollars ) .
These loans initially offered a better rate of interest than the domestic currency , but , as local currencies have dropped in value , the amount of money required to be repaid has increased dramatically .
Business
Week estimates that borrowers in so - called ``emerging markets '' owe some US $ 4.7 trillion in foreign - denominated debt , up 38 % over the past two years .
This is the reassertion of a debt crisis from the 1980s that never really went away , but only partially subsided .
The IMF returns
This unfolding social crisis has returned the IMF to centrestage .
Typically , the IMF lends to those countries facing potential collapse and , in return , demands the fulfillment of stringent economic conditions .
The scale of borrowing is already immense : Iceland ( $ 2.4 billion ) , Ukraine ( $ 16.5 billion ) , and Hungary ( $ 15.7 billion ) have been extended loans with Pakistan , Serbia , Belarus and Turkey likely candidates in the near future .
The conditions that come with this latest round of IMF lending have been particularly opaque .
The policies that Ukraine is expected to pass , for example , are not yet known despite the fact the country has essentially agreed to take a $ 16.5 billion loan from the IMF .
Hungary has agreed to cuts in welfare spending , a freeze in salaries and canceling bonuses for public - sector workers yet the final details have not been made public .
Iceland was required to raise interest rates to 18 % with the economy predicted to contract by 10 % and inflation reaching 20 % .
We can certainly expect that the conditions attached to loans in the poorer countries in the Global South will be much more stringent than those imposed on these European countries .
There is little doubt that these countries will face massive job losses , intense pressure to privatise public resources , and slashing of state spending on welfare , education and health in the name of ``balanced budgets ' ' .
Whether these attacks on the social fabric are successful , however , will ultimately depend on the level of resistance they face .
Authoritarian state
On October 11 , a meeting of progressive economists in Caracas , Venezuela , issued a statement warning that the dynamic of this crisis “ encourages new rounds of capital concentration and , if the people do not firmly oppose this , it is becoming perilously likely that restructuring will occur simply to save privileged sectors ” .
This is an important point to understand .
Capitalist crisis does n't automatically lead to the end of capitalism .
Without effective resistance and struggle , the crisis will eventually be resolved at the expense of working people – particularly those in the South .
This could be one of the most serious crises that capitalism has faced in living memory .
But we should not be fooled into thinking that the system will somehow be reformed or its contradictions solved through peaceful and orderly means .
The most likely immediate outcome is a hardened , more authoritarian state that seeks to restore profitability through ratcheting up repression and forcing people to accept the loss of jobs , housing and any kind of social support .
In the South , this will inevitably mean more war and military repression .
If this is not prevented then the system will utilise this crisis to restructure and continue business as usual .
This is why resistance – both at home and abroad – will be the single most important determinant to how this eventually plays out .
In Latin America , for example , attempts to restrict capital flight , place key economic sectors under popular control , and establish alternative currency and trade arrangements are important initiatives that point to the necessity of solutions beyond capitalism .
In the Middle East , popular resistance to the political and economic control of the region has undoubtedly checked the extension of US power .
Any displacement of crisis onto the South means playing different groups of people against one another .
For this reason , the ideological corollary of war and military repression abroad is likely an increasingly virulent racism in the North – directed at immigrants , people of colour and indigenous populations .
This means that for activists in North America and other rich countries the question of global solidarity and resistance to racism must be placed as a central priority of any effective fightback .
Any attempt to turn inwards , or dismiss international solidarity as less important in this phase , will be disastrous for all working people – across the globe .

From my own experience on expert panels , I know firsthand the pressures that people  might I say mavericks ?
 may feel when questioning the group consensus .
Image Credit ... David G. Klein
I was connected with the Federal Reserve System as a member the economic advisory panel of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York from 1990 until 2004 , when the New York bank ’s new president , Timothy F. Geithner , arrived .
That panel advises the president of the New York bank , who , in turn , is vice chairman of the Federal Open Market Committee , which sets interest rates .
In my position on the panel , I felt the need to use restraint .
While I warned about the bubbles I believed were developing in the stock and housing markets , I did so very gently , and felt vulnerable expressing such quirky views .
Deviating too far from consensus leaves one feeling potentially ostracized from the group , with the risk that one may be terminated .
Reading some of Mr. Geithner ’s speeches from around that time shows that he was concerned about systemic risks but concluded that the financial system was getting “ stronger ” and more “ resilient . ”
He was worried about the unsustainability of a low savings rate , government deficit and current account deficit , none of which caused our current crisis .
In 2005 , in the second edition of my book “ Irrational Exuberance , ” I stated clearly that a catastrophic collapse of the housing and stock markets could be on its way .
I wrote that “ significant further rises in these markets could lead , eventually , to even more significant declines , ” and that this might “ result in a substantial increase in the rate of personal bankruptcies , which could lead to a secondary string of bankruptcies of financial institutions as well , ” and said that this could result in “ another , possibly worldwide , recession . ”
I distinctly remember that , while writing this , I feared criticism for gratuitous alarmism .
And indeed , such criticism came .
I gave talks in 2005 at both the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency and at the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation , in which I argued that we were in the middle of a dangerous housing bubble .
I urged these mortgage regulators to impose suitability requirements on mortgage lenders , to assure that the loans were appropriate for the people taking them .
The reaction to this suggestion was roughly this : yes , some staff members had expressed such concerns , and yes , officials knew about the possibility that there was a bubble , but they were n’t taking any of us seriously .
By Ben Cohen
Bill O'Reilly expressed his fear that a Democratice White House , House and Senate , coupled with the ' liberal media ' would be terrible for America .
It 's funny that a Republican dominated government coupled with the Fox News mouth piece did n't trouble O'Reilly for 8 years .
O'Reilly was set straight by Juan Williams , but the loudmouthed pundit was n't having any of it .
Words cannot express how much joy this fills me with .
To have Republicans in a position of real weakness is perhaps the best thing that could happen to the United States , and it may force them to reevaluate their politics if they want to be taken seriously again .

Oct. 29 , 2008  --
In the waning days of the presidential race , Sen . Barack Obama has poured on the intensity , drawing huge crowds in crucial battleground states and flooding the airwaves with commercials purchased mainly with his seemingly bottomless pit of campaign cash .
During the day Wednesday , the Democratic presidential nominee campaigned in North Carolina and Florida , was interviewed by ABC News ' Charlie Gibson and CNN's Wolf Blitzer , and taped an appearance on " The Daily Show " with Jon Stewart .
Tonight was filled with even more Obama moments .
Across six television networks -- three broadcast , three cable -- Obama , D - Ill. , unveiled a much - anticipated , primetime , 30 - minute infomercial , delivering his closing argument as to why he should be elected president .
ABC News ' Chief Washington correspondent George Stephanopoulos said the infomercial , which cost more than $ 3 million , was worth " just about every penny . "
CLICK HERE for George Stephanopoulos ' full analysis .
" This was a very highly produced , technically incredibly competent half hour of television , " Stephanopoulos said , " all designed to get voters comfortable with Barack Obama in the Oval Office . "
Obama 's Ad : A Presidential Pitch
The ad traveled from scene to scene , weaving several personal stories into a carefully scripted and , at times , presidential - looking pitch .
When Obama appeared on camera , he stood in a well - lit faux oval office , looking stern in front of a large wooden desk .
An American flag stood just over his right shoulder .
The commercial also highlighted some of the most noteworthy moments of Obama 's political career , including a well - received line on education he used in one of his debates .
" Responsibility for our children 's success does n't start in Washington , " he said .
" It starts in our homes .
No education policy can replace a parent who 's involved in their child 's education from day one , who makes sure their children are in school on time , helps them with their homework and attends those parent - teacher conferences . "
" The campaign knows for a fact that when Obama said those lines during the debate , and they had voters hooked up to dial groups , it had the highest response of the entire debate , " said Stephanopoulos .
" So they repeated it tonight . "
This pattern continued throughout the ad .
From health care to the war in Iraq , Obama highlighted central issues , using language voters responded to .
" Every idea that Obama talked about is something campaign knows appeals to undecided voters , " said Stephanopoulos , " especially the economically distressed ones out there in the country right now . "
' Buyer Beware , ' Says McCain Campaign
But even before it aired , Obama 's advertisement had been widely panned by the Republican ticket .
Today , Sen. John McCain , R - Ariz. , criticized the infomercial to reporters calling it a " gauzy , feel - good commercial . "
He then added that the commercial was " paid for with broken promises , " referring to a pledge Obama made to accept public financing for his campaign .
And tonight , not long after the infomercial aired , McCain - Palin campaign spokesman Tucker Bounds delivered the campaign 's official response : " As anyone who has bought anything from an infomercial knows , the sales job is always better than the product .
Buyer beware . "
" That 's an implicit admission that they know the message worked , " said Stephanopoulos .
" They just hope that the messenger wo n't be trusted . "
Tonight 's half - hour ended with a bang : Obama , shown live from Kissimee , Fla. , delivered a fiery speech , with a raucous crowed cheering loudly .
" And now , to all of those who 've joined us from across this country , I say that , in six days , we can choose an economy that rewards work and creates new jobs and fuels our prosperity , starting with the middle class , " he said .
" In six days , we can come together as one nation and one people , and once more choose our better history . "
Voters who live on the West Coast will see an even bigger bang : Obama joined on stage with President Bill Clinton -- a symbolic passing of the torch .
Clinton and Obama : ' Cold War to Cool Peace '
For months after Obama secured the nomination , Clinton seemed reluctant to get fully behind Obama 's campaign -- reportedly telling friends he resented accusations from the Obama camp that he'd tried to play the " race card " in the primaries .
But tonight , all of that will be in the past .
" I think Clinton and Obama are moving from a cold war to a cool peace , " said Stephanopolous .
" President Clinton is out there campaigning in these final days in several states , not only Florida , but also Pennsylvania , Ohio and West Virginia .
" Barack Obama has been praising the Clinton record more and more in his speeches , something he had n't done before .
He is also reaching out to Clinton privately more and more .
He called him a couple of times during the financial crisis , " Stephanopoulos said .
" There is still some healing to be done , but the relationship is getting much better . "
With all his money and the crowds and Clinton , Obama may feel like he's on a roll .
With just six days until the election , today 's ABC News tracking poll shows Obama with an eight - point advantage over John McCain .
But McCain is still fighting , hoping that the estimated millions who saw tonight 's Obama commercial wo n't be swayed .

The USG Open Source Center translates an article from the Persian Afghan press alleging that French troops were at one point close to capturing Usamah Bin Ladin in Afghanistan , but that American forces stopped them from doing so .
It says that a forthcoming French documentary containing interviews with the French soldiers provides proof for the allegation .
The argument is that the Bush administration needed Bin Ladin to be at large in order to justify its military expansionism .
Afghan article says US Bin-Ladin hunt phoney

Afghan article says US Bin-Ladin hunt phoney
Text of article , “ Bin -Ladin on the run ?
The rumour which was fact ” , by Afghan independent secular daily newspaper Hasht-e Sobh on 29 September
So , the rumour was right : French soldiers trapped Usamah Bin-Ladin , but were not allowed by the Americans to arrest the apparent fugitive leader of Al - Qa`idah .
A Bin-Ladin documentary just released by French documentary cinema examines this issue , an issue which has led to heated debate in the French media .
This French documentary shows how the Americans are interested in continuing the game , a bloody and expensive game whose victims are only the unprotected and local people of our dry and dusty country .
It was last year that rumours spread about this report in Kabul , but it has not been taken seriously by the media .
But watching this revealing French documentary changes the rumours into disturbing facts .
“ Bin Laden , the failings of a manhunt ” , produced by Emmanuel Razavi and Eric de Lavarene , two French filmmakers and reporters , assesses and confirms the claims of French soldiers that they could have killed Usamah within two operations , but the American forces prevented them .
This film has not been broadcast publicly yet and is to be broadcast by Planet , a French network .
Even though French soldiers have insisted on this in the battlefield many times , the Elysees Palace in Paris and the White House in America have rejected this , and the Afghan leadership does not have any information about it yet !
The main question that arises is the extent to which the “ Bin Laden on the run ” project is a problem for America and Afghanistan .
Seven years of suicide bombing and explosions , blood and violence , unmanned fighter planes , and old vehicles full of explosives , all to catch a long - bearded Arab whom America apparently hates ?
And an Arab who worked for the CIA in the name of Allah , and who now , also in the name of that same Allah , has conducted a jihad against that same CIA ?
Facing the facts in this Usamah film is a bitter and disturbing experience and will make you nervous and wish that what it is that you are watching is just a baseless rumour , or a figment of Hollywood ’s imagination .
But it is not .
The pictures are real and you are facing a debate in documentary form .
The only justification for the bloody presence of America in Afghanistan is the ambiguous existence of Usamah Bin-Ladin and the Al - Qa ’idah terrorist network .
George Bush , with his “ war on terror ” project , has transformed the middle east and Afghanistan into an inflamed bomb ready to explode , but has not found out anything about his beloved lost Usamah Bin-Ladin so far .
What is seen , and the film also emphases this , is that all these slogans , this fighting and killing are a game , a painful and prolonged game whose end even the players do not know and which is running out of control .
Apparently , it is a game of cat and mouse , just like “ Tom and Jerry ” , the famous cartoon .
But it is a reality that the stubborn one from Texas does not want to catch the mouse – unlike credulous Tom – and that the long - bearded Wahhabi Arab does not want to hide – unlike the intelligent and roaming Jerry .
Their prolonged game has made not only the audiences tired but has also transformed the playground into a big pool of blood .
There have always been questions that neither the politicians have been willing to answer , nor the independent western media to raise .
If Usamah is not the lost one of the Americans , then who is ?
What are the Americans searching for in Afghanistan and who are they looking for ?
The main media in the West remained silent before the report of the Usamah Bin-Ladin arrest by French soldiers .
And , through a news boycott , they reduced a certain fact to a rumour .
Certainly , they will do the same before this film , too .
But instead they will try to complicate the scenario .
More painful than anything else is the political fair in Kabul , a poor fair where everyone offers his despicable commodity – a combination of generous western customers and thankful sellers of the country .
Everyone knows the fact , like “ an obvious secret ” , but no one wants to irritate the delicate minds of their nervous guests , guests who will be staying at home until the new year .
Politicians try to forget such news in Kabul , and this is the advice they give to the people .
Forgetting and ignoring such facts is possible , but how can we forget and ignore the bombs exploding next to our houses every day ?
Bombs which sometimes rise from the ground and sometimes descend from the air .

Matt Emerson , New Orleans , US :
It is unfortunate that Mr. McCain decided that he had to present himself as directed by the Karl Rove school of campaigning .
He is a sensible man with a more moderate outlook than most realize .
We had a choice between fairly high quality candidates for a change from recent contests .
Even though I voted for Mr. Obama , I was surprised by how much I was moved by his election .
I think he will make some improvements , but it is unlikely he can live up to the hype .

1058 Did you know that Brad Pitt was at Mr Obama 's victory rally in Chicago ?
I saw Oprah Winfrey and Jesse Jackson , but not the international film star .
It must have been a big event to get him off the TV .
Or did the camera operators not notice ?
Or was it just me ?
Strangely the father of Mr Pitt 's wife Angelina Jolie - Hollywood actor Jon Voight - is a McCain supporter .
1051 What next for Hillary Clinton ?
Will Mr Obama bring her onto his team , despite the intensity and bitterness of their rivalry during the Democratic primaries ?
It is rumoured that she might get a role in developing healthcare - some unfinished business for Mrs Clinton , who had a similar job when her husband Bill was in the White House .
Chris Cillizza in The Fix blog , Washington Post :
The keys to Obama 's victory are myriad but two factors stand out : the remarkable unpopularity of President George W Bush and the Democratic nominee 's massive fundraising edge ...
The keys to Obama 's victory are myriad but two factors stand out : the remarkable unpopularity of President George W Bush and the Democratic nominee 's massive fundraising edge ...
While McCain did his best to separate himself from the tarnished Bush brand , exit polling in key states showed he had not done enough .
In Pennsylvania , more than half of all voters said McCain would be a continuation of Bush policies and that bloc went for Obama by a 90 percent to 10 percent margin .

Until the last moment , most people here simply could not believe that the United States would ever vote for an African - American .
It 's widely believed here that President Ahmadinejad himself is looking for a reconciliation with the United States .
But there are many conflicting views amongst the Iranian ruling elite , and the president himself is known for an approach to diplomacy that is , to put it mildly , rather eccentric . "
Keelan Dennis in Springfield , Oregon says :
The election of President Elect Obama will have huge repercussions across the US .

We spoke with a loud voice , calling for change and stating that the person and their ideas are more important than race or gender .

1018 The party room for the McCain campaign in Phoenix , Arizona , still looks a mess .
There are bits of paper all over the place .
Hopefully the cleaners will give it a better go in the morning .
Perhaps they are too dejected about the local boy 's fate .
1008 I wonder how Mr McCain views his loss .
Is it easier to take than in 2000 , when he was beaten by George W Bush to the Republican nomination ?
The wisdom in football - or soccer , to our US readers - is that it is more disappointing to be eliminated from a competition at the semi-final stage than to lose the final .
At least Mr McCain 's name will appear in even the most basic historic accounts of this election .
At least his does n't have quite the same sense of " What if ? "
At least he has been to the " show " , not just the very public auditions .

It still seems that nothing could be finer than the result from North Carolina .
So far it looks like 49.8 % for Obama and 49.6 % for McCain .
There are several other issues on the ballot which could be delaying the count .
0957 Is it a double win ?
In Tuesday 's live text , we mentioned that two American bison - named John and Barack - were engaged in a popularity contest among staff at the UK's Whipsnade zoo .
Well , the law of the jungle - or is that the prairie ?
- dictated that only one beast could succeed .
A zoo spokeswoman says : " Barack won hoofs down , thanks to his friendly personality and hairy good looks .
He is currently munching on his carrot , triumphantly , while John watches from the sidelines .
Keepers have commiserated with him and he's had some hay to compensate . "
A bitter taste indeed , one imagines .

Well , with 11 weeks to go until Mr Obama is sworn in as president , John Podesta , a former chief of staff to President Bill Clinton , has been asked to oversee the White House transition for the Democrats .
The 538 electoral college votes provided by the 50 US states are not actually " cast " until 15 December , in what is a ceremonial but constitutionally necessary event .
A joint session of Congress on 6 January will count the votes , with Mr Obama inaugurated two weeks later .
Joan , Sheffield , UK : I think Obama is a very brave man but whether he can live up to the expectations that have been placed on him remains to be seen , never has a President carried with him the hopes and dreams of so many Americans .

Bridget Johnson in Pajamas Media : Neither you nor John McCain focused on much of anything south of the border during the campaign , but there are volatile situations that could blow up in your face very quickly .
In Mexico , you have a violent drug war buoyed by drug smuggling across our border and a methamphetamine market that has been cornered by Mexican cartels since we enacted pseudoephedrine restrictions .
In South America , you have a Venezuelan leader trying to rally others against " The Empire " ( us ) while cutting economic and military deals with Iran and Russia .

0913 A quick point for those of you who might be wondering why our total amount of electoral college votes declared for Mr McCain and Mr Obama ( 511 ) - when added to the 26 left for Missouri and North Carolina - comes to 537 , rather than the total of 538 .
Apparently Nebraska , which gives its five votes out district - by - district - rather than on a winner - takes - all basis - has only declared four of them so far .

There are those who believe that the Cylons were created by man .
Some believe that they were created by a race of highly advanced lizards who used them as foot soldiers in the war to exterminate humanity .
Well , it ’s time to bring the rampant speculation and flame - wars to an end .
Today , on the 30th anniversary of Battlestar Galactica , the true origins of everyone ’s favorite red-eyed , robotic menace will finally be revealed …
You want to know where the Cylons came from ?
They were created by this guy :
No , this is n’t a spoiler pic of some evil robot scientist from the upcoming Caprica , the person you see here is the real deal – the man who put ink to paper thirty years ago and fleshed out the look of Starbuck and Apollo ’s chrome - plated foes .
Ladies , gentlemen and daggits , I give you Andrew Probert – father / creator of the Cylons .
IN THE BEGINNING
I tracked down the famous designer / illustrator to see if I could cajole him into revealing the nuts and bolts ( har har ) of the Cylons ’ conceptual history , a request he was only too happy to oblige ( and it did n’t even take a Landram full of cubits ) .
Probert ’s thirty - year career has been wide and varied , although his greatest claim to fame stems from serving as Senior Illustrator for Star Trek : The Next Generation .
Do you get goosebumps when you see the Enterprise - D or feel your pulse rush at the sight of the updated Romulan Warbird ?
Thank this guy .
But before giving Starlfeet a facelift was even a twinkle in Andrew ’s eye , he was hard at work whipping the Cylons into shape .
Glen Larson had initially hired famed designer Ralph McQuarrie ( hot off the heels of Star Wars ’ success ) to create a series of illustrations to help sell Galactica to ABC .
Once the show was picked up and pre-production began in earnest , Probert was brought in to pick up the ball and evolve the look of the soon - to - be-robots .
“ My initial concepts emerged from Ralph McQuarrie ’s Cylons and the design for the show ’s ‘ Imperious Leader ’ , with it ’s step - down mouth area . ”
Probert explained .
“ Glen Larson wanted the helmet to have a skull - like appearance ( which is what I origi nally submitted ) but in the end , the final modeling skewed more toward Darth Vader .
Also , although it was eventually changed to chrome , my original colors were dark greens under a dark kind of bronze - copper metal . ”
“ After the prototype helmet was started , I was asked to provide concepts for the entire suit .
The one requirement was that it should have “ high - waisted ” proportions .
Starting with the front , where I echoed the helmet ’s ‘ mouth - area ’ horizontal slats , placed just under the chest ( those ‘ slats ’ , incidentally , were there originally to duplicate the Cylon Fighter cockpit windows , as a way of providing a subconscious visual unity ) . ”
UNDER THE INFLUENCE
Since the original series did n’t have the luxury of anything - you - want CGI , the Centurion design needed to take into account that people would have to be placed inside .
“ My first concern was getting the actors to see out of the helmets , ” explained Probert .
“ Very small holes were eventually added to provide visibility for them .
The remaining pieces were designed after researching historical suits of armor , observing how various elements were crafted to allow as much free movement as possible .
Starting with that as a basis , there was a bit of experimentation and fitting of prototype pieces until everything worked . ”
Many assume the Cylon Centurion was influenced by Roman Centurions , but Probert quickly dispelled this long - held belief .
“ I actually came up with the idea of modeling them after ancient Greek helmets , along with their top crest , playing on the idea that these “ ancient astronauts ” might have influenced our ancestors , ” he revealed .
“ Strengthening that similarity , I also added a skirt and short - sword .
Riding on that idea , I started sketching Galactica ’s pilot helmets with an Egyptian theme which were subsequently designed by Joe Johnston . ”
On the left , backpack details are worked out .
On the right , an alternate Centurion design , in keeping with the “ high waisted ” look the producers wanted
THE BIG QUESTION
Andrew was also able to finally settle a point of contention that has been argued since the show began – were the Centurions always supposed to be robots ? ”
“ Originally the Galactica motion picture ( for overseas distribution ) was filmed with dialog explaining that the Cylons were creatures , ” Probert confirmed .
“ They were blind and created helmet scanners to see .
That explains the helmets .
Then , since their suits could also allow them to survive in space , I provided a back - mounted support system .
Also , after several viewings of Star Wars , I did n’t want these bad guys dropping their weapons like the Stormtroopers did , so I included an arm - mounted weapon on their right wristband .
The giant hockey gloves that were added made those pretty useless and the Cylons ended up carrying ( and dropping ) guns after all . ”
“ The living Cylons were changed to robots for the TV series because of an hourly body - count limitation for prime - time television .
There was , however , no limit to how many robots could be ‘ killed ’ per hour so they became robots and dialog was revised to explain it all . ”
I asked Andrew how he might have designed the Cylons differently if not encumbered by the man - in - a - suit limitation .
“ I probably would have really gone after that skull - like appearance and proportions , assuming the ( then ) living creatures inside were some sort of alternately - evolved humanoid - types , ” he said .
“ If they ’d been robots from the beginning , I might have provided the lower portions with a mono wheel , allowing them to maneuver over any terrain , and their tops would have multiple appendages for a variety of evil grasping and / or shooting tasks . ”
What might the Cylons have looked like if Probert had a crack at them today ?
He sent me this never - before - seen sketch , explaining “ nine years ago , someone asked me what I thought the ‘ next generation ’ of Cylons might look like .
This was my first response . ”
Many thanks to Mr. Probert for taking time out to dig into his archives and share this rare glimpse into Cylon history .

News has leaked that New York Giants wide receiver Plaxico Burress accidentally shot himself in the leg Friday .
Now it begs the question as to why ?
We at Gunaxin have a couple of ideas :
10 .
His opponent in fantasy football was starting him this week and he decided to “ show ” him .
9 . He was snipe hunting .
8 . It was the first time all year he managed to find his way around a safety and he just got too excited .
7 . He ’s been watching too much 8 Mile and Cheddar Bob is his favorite character .
6 . The playoffs were coming and he felt he needed to even the playing field a little .
I mean he can still burn Ellis Hobbs on one leg .
5 . He wants to join the Oakland Raiders and thought this was a guaranteed in .
4 . He simply decided to shoot off something other than his mouth for once .
3 . He thought he was at the movies .
Just ask Chris Rock …
2 . He is involved in an ultimate game of one - upsmanship with Adam “ Pac - Man ” Jones .
Your move Pac - Man .
1. He was Keepin ’ It Real .
Warning :
The pre-budget report means more pain to come , for little gain today
As a saver whose income is modestly into the higher tax bracket , yesterday ’s pre-budget report was n’t great .
Here are the main measures designed to get Labour re-elected and stimulate the economy :
Spend now :
Temporary cut in VAT , from 17.5 % to 15 % ( until December 2009 )
Extra £ 60 to pensioners in January
Early increase in child tax credits
£ 120 basic rate tax rebate ( introduced after the 10 p farce ) made permanent , which will increase to £ 145 in April
Proposed rise in tax for small businesses from 21 p to 22 p is deferred
£ 3 billion in government spending to be brought forward
Sundry other minor fiddling designed to get headlines ( a green fund , phasing in changes on fuel duty )
Pay later :
Rise in income tax to 45 % for those earning over £ 150,000 ( April 2011 )
National insurance increase of 0.5 % for employers and employees ( April 2011 )
Cuts in the personal allowance for those earning over £ 100,000 ( April 2010 )
Government borrowing to rise to £ 118 billion in 2009 ( 8 % of GDP ! )
UK net debt as a share of GDP to rise to 57 % by 2011
Why it ’s a bad budget for me
Like many Monevator readers , I wo n’t benefit much from Gordon Brown ’s giveaway :
I do n’t benefit from the tax credit giveaways , since I do n’t have kids and I ’m not a pensioner .
Most years my income is modestly into the higher - rate tax bracket ( around £ 40,000 ) , which will mean higher taxes in a couple of years due to the National Insurance rise .
I save rather than spend , which means a VAT cut wo n’t help .
Long - term interest rates will rise because of all this borrowing , which means I ’ll pay higher interest rates when it finally makes sense to buy a house rather than rent .
On a brighter note , I ’ll see a small reduction in tax next year , due to the 10 p rebate going permanent
Since I know my bills and expenses are going to rise in the future , the rational thing for me to do ahead of the downturn to save more today .
This is the paradox of thrift , and it explains why I think the budget should have been aimed at getting money moving via infrastructural spending , rather than short - term VAT cuts .
Why it ’s not the best budget for the country
I freely admit I ’m not an economist , but the ‘ big idea ’ – the cut in VAT – does n’t look like the best use of £ 12 billion from a national point of view , either .
Prices are already plunging in the shops , so who is going to notice a 2.5 % reduction ?
Worse , retailers are going to have to spend money changing their signage and sticker prices .
More likely most wo n’t , which means it ’ll just bolster their margins .
( Perhaps avoiding retail bankruptcies is the real motivation ? )
I wrote before that I did n’t want the Government to cut my taxes , which is effectively what they ’ve done with the VAT fiddling .
Worse , Gordon Brown and Alistair Darling are actually putting taxes up for higher - rate earners , which might have some redistributive merit but is n’t going to raise much money and will only depress spending at the higher end .
On a more positive note , the Government is going to direct most money to the poor ( who will spend it , which is what you want from a stimulus ) and bring forward capital investment projects .
It should have done more such investment , targeting its spending to get lasting results as well as a stimulus .
President Elect Obama in the US is proposing to build thousands of wind turbines to create hundreds of thousands of jobs while reducing energy imports and carbon emmissions .
Encouraging us to buy more tat in the shops with a VAT cut seems pretty pathetic in comparison .
For individuals , it ’s best to ignore the VAT cuts .
Instead , get out of debt , save more , and watch your mortgage , as I outlined in my four steps to tackling the credit crunch .
The school charges A$ 16,000 a year in fees for final - year students
The entire graduating class at an exclusive Australian boys school has been suspended over " unacceptable " end - of - term antics .
Up to 100 of 250 Year 12 students at Xavier College , Melbourne , allegedly took part in the " muck - up day " trouble .
They ran through the school wearing only their school ties as G - strings , and set off fireworks at a nearby railway station , media reports say .
Classes have been cancelled until Wednesday , the scheduled final day .
Vehicles ' damaged '
The trouble began at lunchtime on Monday - " muck - up day " , an unofficial tradition of graduating students taking part in end - of - term pranks and other activities .
They were blind drunk and some of them could barely stand .
My kids have been through muck - up day , but I 've never seen anything like that
Local resident Police said they received numerous complaints relating to up to 100 students running rampage in the neighbourhood .
They were said to have harassed drivers and disrupted traffic , and there are also allegations that vehicles were damaged .
The students - aged 17 and 18 - are also accused of running semi-naked through the school grounds and setting off fireworks at the nearby Balaclava railway station .
One student was admitted to hospital with multiple fractures in his leg after a playground game reportedly got out of hand .
One neighbourhood resident wrote to The Age newspaper alleging the students were drunk and badly behaved .
" Their behaviour was disgraceful , " the man said .
" They were blind drunk and some of them could barely stand .
My kids have been through muck - up day , but I 've never seen anything like that . "
' Contravened boundaries '
In response the school has cancelled all classes until Wednesday , which would have been the final day of teaching .
Exams are due to begin at the end of the month for the Year 12 students , said to pay A$ 16,000 ( US $ 11,000 ; £ 6,500 ) a year in fees to attend the Roman Catholic school .
In a statement , the school said the boys had " contravened the boundaries of sensible behaviour " while playing a game , and that the " unacceptable " conduct had forced it to cancel remaining classes .
It did not refer to the trouble off - campus , but police have threatened criminal charges against the pupils involved .
BBC
News website readers have been sending in their comments :
What ever happened to a good wallop across the head !
That 's what these boys are lacking !
When I went to Catholic School ( graduate of 1995 ) we were taught respect , and were disciplined accordingly if having stepped out of line .
The problem is these little rich kids have never learnt respect for others , never learnt how to take responsibility for their actions and certainly have no idea on social etiquette .
Bring back the cane ! :-)
Cleve Rynehart , Melbourne , Australia I attended and enjoyed what seems to be a similar academic boys school in Canada .
We also had an unofficial " muck - up day " called " grub day " and the tradition ended in much the same way : behaviour and stunts taken too far so it was cancelled .
The consensus at the time was that an unsustainable , escalating pattern of one - upmanship , whereby each graduating class felt a need to make things more extreme and wilder than the previous year , was the problem .
Clever became vulgar , and fun became outrageous .
Jim Fuite , Edmonton , Canada Glad to see not much has changed since my departure from Xavier in 1968 .
Now , if only the Jesuits would bring back the 15 - inch strap ( with the two inlaid Aussie pennies at one end ) , all would be right with life .
Well done boys . . . you 've made some of us old timers proud .
Timothy Lynch , Los Angeles , CA USA
As a Xavier alumni , it is disappointing to hear that the actions of a minority of students taking things too far have tarnished the reputation of a great educational institution .
If indeed these allegations are true then they should be disciplined .
However , how did the residents know they were all Xavier students ?
At my muck - up day , everyone ( including students from other private schools in Kew , of which there are many ) took off their ties and blazers , so it would have been very difficult for onlookers to distinguish which school the students belonged to .
I think it might be another case of the media reporting everything it hears without actually checking the facts .
Peter C , London
It 's almost like a tradition in all boarding school facilities for final year and graduating students to do something really wild and crazy before leaving school .
We did it during my time by boycotting almost all regular school activities and had to sign an undertaking to be of good behaviour in the process .
It 's part of growing up ...

Countdown clocks began ticking down on Tuesday toward Friday ’s launch of the space shuttle Endeavour on a mission to outfit the International Space Station for an expanded live - aboard crew .
Lift - off is targeted for 1955 EST ( 0055 Saturday GMT ) from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida .
At a news conference on Tuesday , managers said the shuttle was in good shape for launch .
“ We have n’t had a launch for a while so we ’re really excited to be back in the saddle , ” said NASA ’s Jeff Spaulding , a manager overseeing preparations for shuttle Endeavour ’s flight .

Endeavour ’s mission , scheduled to last 15 days , is devoted to preparing the station for a permanent six - member crew – double the current size .
Among the new gear : a $ 250 million water recycling system that will enable the crew to turn urine and other wastewater into drinking water ; two new sleeping berths ; and perhaps most important , a second toilet .
“ Our family in space is growing , ” said Joe Delai , the NASA manager in charge of Endeavour ’s cargo .
“ Putting in that second bathroom becomes important . ”
Tidying up
NASA had planned to fly a mission last month to service the Hubble Space Telescope but postponed the flight to allow engineers time to assemble components to fix a new problem with one of the observatory ’s computers .
The final flight to Hubble was retargeted for May 2009 .
The delay returned NASA ’s attention to completing the construction and outfitting of the space station .
Nine more flights are expected before the space shuttles are retired in 2010 .
The space station crew , which includes newly arrived commander Michael Fincke , has been tidying up in preparation for the shuttle ’s visit .
Fincke beamed down television images of cluttered areas and asked flight controllers for help figuring out where to stash gear left over from previous spacewalks and other activities .
“ This is not how we were hoping to find things stowed , ” Fincke told flight controllers .
“ A place for everything and everything in its place . ”
Fincke and flight engineer Yury Lonchakov arrived at the station last month .
The third crew member , astronaut Gregory Chamitoff , will be replaced by Endeavour astronaut Sandra Magnus .
Chamitoff , who has been aboard the station since June , will return home on the shuttle .
Magnus and her crew mates – commander Chris Ferguson , pilot Eric Boe , Don Pettit and spacewalkers Heidemarie Stefanyshyn - Piper , Stephen Bowen and Shane Kimbrough – arrived at the Florida spaceport on Tuesday to prepare for Friday ’s lift - off .
Meteorologists predicted a 60 % chance the weather would be suitable for launch .
What would it take to stop you from gaming ?
If you said being bedridden , hooked up to various machines with limited use of your limbs , then you are a complete wuss .
Just ask PlayStation 3 forum poster KitsuneYume , who built a PS3 controller he works with his entire body , including his mouth .
While the setup wo n't win any product design awards , it allows Kitsune there access to 20 out of 25 possible controller functions using 16 switches and a joystick he controls with his tongue , all wired into a standard PS3 controller .
The main reason I put this on the PlayStation website was to show people that even the most limited person can still enjoy console gaming just as much ... anyone else .
the controller was pretty easy to make except for converting the analog signals into digital signals for when I use the various switches .
this took about two months to build and get working effectively .
Advertisement
So how does it play ?
Good enough to keep Kitsune gaming , and that 's all that really matters , is n't it ?
It works just as good as any other .
it was actually made with a PlayStation controller circuit board inside the box .
it is just as responsive when I use my tongue , but if I use a switch for a direction of one of the joysticks it 's like pushing it all the way one direction .
I was able to beat the demo of mirrors edge , heavenly sword , eternal sonata and just about every other demo on the PlayStation network .
the only games I have difficulty with are football games .... because I do n't have very good strategy when it comes to sports games lol but I am practicing so I can play some of my friends who are really into football : -)

Now if that does n't show what a powerful force of inspiration gaming can be , I do n't know what will .

The art of the toilet in Japan
Smart young women at Panasonic show off the latest wares Duncan Bartlett discovers how , when it comes to lavatories , Japan is a step ahead of the rest of the world .
No country takes toilets quite so seriously as Japan .
Machines with heated seats , built - in bidets and a dynamic range of flushing options are almost ubiquitous in homes and public buildings .
A poem recently published by a stressed - out salary man captured their comforting appeal with haiku - like brevity .
" The only warmth in my life is the toilet seat , " he mourned .
But lavatories here can do much more than keep you warm .
One even sends a tiny electrical charge through the user 's buttocks to check their body - fat ratio .
The master of the modern convenience is the Panasonic Corporation .
Booming market
At its Tokyo showroom , located in a skyscraper near the BBC 's office , a group of smart young women , dressed in uniforms resembling flight attendants , showed me the company 's latest wares .
The lids lifted up when I approached .
If I stood in front of one , it took a guess at my gender and lifted up the seat as well .
There was a loo that glowed in the dark and another that had built - in loudspeakers .
With manicured fingernails , the demonstrator pushed the control panel beside the seat and gentle light classical music began to play .
Pleasant enough , I thought , although I preferred a pastoral sound effect that provided the impression one was seated upon a white plastic throne surrounded by songbirds in a springtime meadow .
Japanese people do not see cleaning as a demeaning or shameful job Kyoko Ishii , who heads up the public relations department for Panasonic , explained to me that most of the people who choose luxury loos are older women , so this is a booming market in rapidly ageing Japan .
Kyoko says that for this core customer group , the emphasis now is less on the gadgetry and more on convenience and cleanliness .
A new flush has been invented which does away with the need for a tank and saves dramatically on water .
The device costs about £ 1,950 ( $ 3,000 ) including installation .
But it is not easy to sell outside Japan as bathrooms in other countries are rarely fitted with the right mixture of sophisticated plumbing and electronics .
Clean culture A visitor to Tokyo recently told me that he was surprised to find Japanese women rather than foreigners cleaning the toilets in his hotel .
Advertisements for toilets are screened on public transport
It is of course often immigrants who take on such jobs in rich countries .
But foreign - born workers are rare here as only about 1.5 % of the population are made up of non-native Japanese .
However , the low immigration level is only part of the explanation .
Japanese people do not see cleaning as a demeaning or shameful job .
School children are trained from a young age to sweep their classrooms and scour the playground for litter .
Lorry drivers wash their trucks at the end of every day .
No restaurant ever serves a meal without first offering the customer a cleansing towel .
Recently , I visited a small technology company in Osaka .
The president , Mr Sugimoto , is trying to inspire his staff to work harder as recession takes hold .
The Japanese - like the British - do not seem to mind too much when comedians sink into vulgarity and joke about scatological matters
He is noted for his drive and enthusiasm and that came across in a punchy presentation which he showed me on his laptop .
It included photographs of his staff on their knees scrubbing the urinals .
His point was that in preparation for a new project , the whole team had mucked in to clean up the workplace and this was clearly a source of pride to be included in the company 's publicity .
Source of comfort
But toilets can raise a smile , too .
Television comedies sometimes include scenes of pranksters luring people into loos whose walls then collapse , and the embarrassment this causes the victim is a source of great hilarity .
The toilet then appeared to give a welcoming robotic smile and its seat began to glow an inviting orange colour as it heated up , ready for action
The Japanese - like the British - do not seem to mind too much when comedians sink into vulgarity and joke about scatological matters .
But there is also a dark underground trade in DVDs filmed in ladies ' toilets by hidden cameras , and only last week a man was arrested for placing " spycams " in the lavatories of a girls ' school .
Most of the time , though , the Japanese are happy to think of a toilet as their comfort and their friend .
The other day , while catching a commuter train to work , I found myself transfixed by an advertisement which was being screened on a TV inside the carriage .
A young girl slowly walked towards a loo , which automatically raised its lid to greet her .
The toilet then appeared to give a welcoming robotic smile and its seat began to glow an inviting orange colour as it heated up , ready for action .
Fortunately , the advertisement ended there .
But not before a broad and appreciative smile broke out across the face of the girl .

Hate Groups Riled Up Over Prospect of President Obama Fringe groups to be watched even more closely if Obama wins .
 --
The prospect of a Black president has America 's bastions of hate in an uproar .
Leaders , including the wizard of the Imperial Klans of America , Ron Edwards , have long warned the white race is under attack and must be defended .
Federal authorities say web sites have featured ugly calls to target Senator Barack Obama .
And twice now since August , two sets of self - proclaimed neo - Nazi skinheads have been caught in what officials say were feeble but still troubling plots to assassinate Obama .
" If Obama is elected president , these people see the world as they know it to end , " said Morris Dees , co-founder of the Southern Poverty Law Center .
In the most recent case , federal agents say two men , Daniel Cowart and Paul Schlesselman , planned to go on a killing spree against more than a hundred African Americans and then , they told the Secret Service , go out in a blaze of glory , dressed in white tuxedos and top hats during the assassination attempt .
Cowart is described as the leader .
" His views are strongly Neo - Nazi , " said Dees , " which explains why he wants to kill black people and why he 's ultimately interested in the assassination of Sen. Obama . "
Cowart and Schlesselman told the Secret Service they met using the website of a new hate group , the Supreme White Alliance , a next generation of neo -Nazis and racist skin heads .
" We 're being discriminated against just because we believe in our white rights , " said Steven Edwards of Muhlenberg County , Kentucky , who is considered the leader of the Supreme White Alliance .
Like his father , the Klan wizard before him , Edwards represents yet another generation of Americans who find comfort in hate .
It is a fringe group , but one that will be even more closely watched if the country elects as President a mixed - race Black man who represents all they fear .
In an contentious interview with ABC News Chief Investigative Correspondent Brian Ross on Nightline Tuesday , Edwards said that the assassination plot alarmed him and he sought to portray his group as a social club , with no ties to two men under arrest .
( Click here to watch the Nightline report . )
Social Club or White Power Group ?
" We are a club , so we get together , socialize , more of a social type thing for people of the same views , " said Edwards .
" Do we hate ?
No we do n't hate .
We hate certain people and things that go on in the world . "
But Edwards sings a different tune , one of extreme hate , when he is with his followers .
He is a kind of rock star on the hate circuit for his song " No Mercy " , performed at what are called Nordic fests , a Woodstock for the Neo - Nazi , skinhead set .
" What about the Jews ?
No mercy ! , " Edwards is seen singing in a video from a concert three years ago .
" What about the spics No Mercy ?
What about the N*****s? No Mercy !
What about the Faggots ?
No mercy ?
What about the Traitors ?
No mercy ! "
But when asked about the song by ABC News , Edwards replied , " I did n't write that song . "
" They have what they call a public front , to tell you that hey , we 're not violent , we do n't promote violence , we 're just interested in getting our views across , representing white people 's interest and free speech , " said Dees .
" But they have a private side represented by the Dan Cowart and his associate , this individual in this case , these groups would certainly never never admit . "
Edwards says the man arrested in the Obama death plot , Daniel Cowart , was never a full member of the Supreme White Alliance , the SWA .
But Cowart is seen pictured at a SWA party this April to honor the birthday of Adolph Hitler .
Edwards say Obama , for his race , is a smart man , and that he is opposed to any effort to kill him , but he again tried to stop the interview when asked if he would call the police if a member of his group expressed any desire to harm Obama .
While most white supremacist groups have drawn the line at mentioning violence against Obama , a recent example shows that some long - kept quite feelings of hate groups are beginning to emerge , according to equality advocates .
Hate Beginning to Emerge ?
While most white power groups have drawn the line at mentioning violence against Obama , a recent example shows that some long - kept quiet feelings of hate groups are beginning to emerge , according to equality advocates .
" Most white supremacist groups are trying to figure out how they can make hay out of an Obama presidency , " said Southern Poverty Law Center director Mark Potok , who is in charge of the center 's Intelligence Project .
A prime example , said Potok , is Bill White , the self - described neo -Nazi and leader of the American National Socialist Workers Party who was indicted last week for allegedly soliciting injury to a member of a jury that convicted a white supremacist four years ago for soliciting the murder of a federal judge in Chicago .
The case revolves around White 's alleged posting of the juror 's home address and phone numbers to a website that officials have since taken down .
But there is an item marked as an exhibit inside the criminal complaint which stands out : a full - color magazine cover showing an image of Democratic Presidential candidate Sen .
Barack Obama waving to a crowd , targeted by a swastika and a rifle 's crosshairs .
Bold words read , " Kill This N*****? "
The complaint says the cover was posted on White 's website on Sept. 9 , 2008 , along with a comment which sought $ 10,000 to print 20,000 copies of it before the upcoming election .
As the historic race to the White House nears to an end , Deborah Lauter , civil rights director of the Anti-Defamation League , said tension is mounting and " everyone is on high alert . "
She said yesterday 's arrest of the two Tennessee men is of great concern .
" What it showed us is that white extremists who have a propensity to act out during a presidential campaign in fact were prepared to do that , " said Lauter , adding that the incident showed that " our fears unfortunately can be realized . "
The SWA said that while one of the men was affiliated with the SWA earlier this year , he has since been ousted , and the alliance has not been in contact with either Cowart or Schlesselman .
White is n't making any statements at this time , but his attorney , Bill Cleaveland , said " he is preparing to defend himself on the charge . "
White told the New York Times last month that he was planning to use an $ 8,000 donation from a Michigan supporter to print and distribute 20,000 copies of the magazine cover on the latest issue of The Nationalist Socialist to white working - class neighborhoods .
The Times article said White " said the cover was satirical and pointed to a subheading that read , " Negro Deification and the ' Obama Assassination ' Myth " . "
He gained notoriety for his extreme comments and internet postings , including one in which he essentially encouraged the lynching of the Jena 6 , according to the FBI .
This recent criminal complaint in White 's case says the web site that he maintained until the FBI recently shut it down contained editorial comments of concern , such as anti-Semitic rants and references to lynchings .
White , who lives in Roanoke , is currently jailed without bond in the Roanoke City Jail in the custody of the U.S. Marshals , while he awaits extradition to federal court in Chicago .
His attorney said
White will fight the transfer so that he can take care of his local rental properties and his wife and 8 - month old daughter .
The Illinois office of the U.S. Attorney says a tentative arraignment date for White in Chicago is set for Nov. 12 .

Feeling undervalued can cause stress Inconsiderate bosses not only make work stressful , they may also increase the risk of heart disease for their employees , experts believe .
A Swedish team found a strong link between poor leadership and the risk of serious heart disease and heart attacks among more than 3,000 employed men .
And the effect may be cumulative - the risk went up the longer an employee worked for the same company .
The study is published in Occupational and Environmental Medicine .
Stressful environment Experts said that feeling undervalued and unsupported at work can cause stress , which often fosters unhealthy behaviours , such as smoking , that can lead to heart disease .
Previous work has shown that unfair bosses can drive up their employees ' blood pressure , and persistent high blood pressure can increase heart disease risk .
For the latest study , researchers from the Karolinska Institute and Stockholm University tracked the heart health of the male employees , aged between 19 and 70 and working in the Stockholm area , over a period of nearly a decade .
During this time 74 cases of fatal and non-fatal heart attack or acute angina , or death from ischaemic heart disease , occurred .
All the participants were asked to rate the leadership style of their senior managers on competencies such as how clearly they set out goals for their staff and how good they were at communicating and giving feedback .
Feeling undervalued and unsupported can cause stress , which often leads to unhealthy behaviours ... adding to your risk of developing heart problems
Cathy Ross of the British Heart Foundation
The staff who deemed their senior managers to be the least competent had a 25 % higher risk of a serious heart problem .
And those working for what was classed as a long time - four years or more - had a 64 % higher risk .
The findings held true , regardless of educational attainment , social class , income , workload , lifestyle factors , such as smoking and exercise , and other risk factors for heart disease , such as high blood pressure and diabetes .
The researchers , which included experts from University College London in the UK and the Finnish Institute of Occupational Health , said that if a direct cause and effect was confirmed , then managers ' behaviour should be targeted in a bid to stave off serious heart disease among less senior employees .
They said managers should give employees clear work objectives and sufficient power in relation to their responsibilities .
Cathy Ross , cardiac nurse for the British Heart Foundation , said : " This limited , male - only study suggests that a good , clear working relationship with your manager may help to protect against heart disease .
" Feeling undervalued and unsupported can cause stress , which often leads to unhealthy behaviours such as smoking , eating a poor diet , drinking too much alcohol and not getting enough exercise - adding to your risk of developing heart problems .
" Being fit and active can give you the double benefit of busting work stress and boosting your heart health at the same time . "

The phenomenon of modern Islamic terrorism has forged an inchoate strategic alliance between the Israeli and Indian governments , while heightening the awareness of a common threat — the institution of jihad — among the civilian populations of these nations .
Rarely understood , let alone acknowledged , however , is the history of brutal jihad conquest , Muslim colonization , and the imposition of dhimmitude shared by the Jews of historical Palestine , and the Hindus of the Indian subcontinent .
Moreover , both peoples and nations also have in common , a subsequent , albeit much briefer British colonial legacy , which despite its own abuses , abrogated the system of dhimmitude ( permanently for Israel and India , if not , sadly , for their contemporary Muslim neighboring states ) , and created the nascent institutions upon which thriving democratic societies have been constructed .
Sir Jadunath Sarkar ( d. 1958 ) , the preeminent historian of Mughal India , wrote with admiration in 1950 of what the Jews of Palestine had accomplished once liberated from the yoke of dhimmitude .
The implication was clear that he harbored similar hopes for his own people .
Palestine , the holy land of the Jews , Christians and Islamites , had been turned into a desert haunted by ignorant poor diseased vermin rather than by human beings , as the result of six centuries of Muslim rule .
( See Kinglake 's graphic description ) .
Today Jewish rule has made this desert bloom into a garden , miles of sandy waste have been turned into smiling orchards of orange and citron , the chemical resources of the Dead Sea are being extracted and sold , and all the amenities of the modern civilised life have been made available in this little Oriental country .
Wise Arabs are eager to go there from the countries ruled by the Shariat .
This is the lesson for the living history . [ 1 ]
Earlier , I reviewed at length the legacy of Muslim jihad conquest and imposition of the Shari'a in historical Palestine .
The current essay provides a schematic overview of the same phenomena in India , focusing on the major periods of Muslim conquest , colonization , and rule .
A Millennium of Jihad and Dhimmitude on the Indian Subcontinent
The 570 year period between the initial Arab Muslim razzias ( ordered by Caliph Umar ) to pillage Thana ( on the West Indian coast near Maharashtra ) in 636— 637 C.E. , and the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate ( under Qutub — ud — din Aibak , a Turkish slave soldier ) , can be divided into four major epochs : ( I ) the conflict between the Arab invaders and the ( primarily ) Hindu resisters on the Western coast of India from 636— 713 C.E. ; ( II ) the Arab and Turkish Muslim onslaughts against the kingdom of Hindu Afghanistan during 636— 870 C.E. ; ( III ) repeated Turkish efforts to subdue the Punjab from 870 C.E. to 1030 C.E. C.E. highlighted by the devastating campaigns of Mahmud of Ghazni ( from 1000 — 1030 C.E. ) ; and finally ( IV ) Muhammad Ghauri 's conquest of northwestern India and the Gangetic valley between 1175 and 1206 C.E . [ 2 ]
This summary chronology necessarily overlooks the very determined and successful resistance that was offered by the Hindus to both the Arab ( in particular ) and Turkish invaders , for almost four centuries .
For example , despite the rapidity of Mahmud of Ghazni 's conquests — spurred by shock — tactics and the religious zealotry of Islamic jihad — his successors , for almost 150 years , could not extend their domain beyond the Punjab frontiers .
Even after the establishment of the Delhi Sultanate ( 1206 — 1526 ) , and the later Mughal Empire ( 1526 — 1707 ) , Muslim rulers failed to Islamize large swaths of Indian territory , and most of the populace . [ 3 ]
The first Mughal Emperor , Babur ( 1483 — 1530 ) , made these relevant observations upon establishing his rule in India : [ 4 ]
[ Hindustan ] is a different world ... once the water of Sindh is crossed , everything is in the Hindustan way — land , water , tree , rock , people , and horde , opinion and custom ... Most of the inhabitants of Hindustan are pagans ; they call a pagan a Hindu .
Buddhist civilization within India , in stark contrast , proved far less resilient .
Vincent Smith has described the devastating impact of the late 12th century jihad razzias against the Buddhist communities of northern India , centered around Bihar , based on Muslim sources , exclusively : [ 5 ]
The Muhammadan historian , indifferent to distinctions among idolators , states that the majority of the inhabitants were ' clean shaven Brahmans ' , who were all put to the sword .
He evidently means Buddhist monks , as he was informed that the whole city and fortress were considered to be a college , which the name Bihar signifies .
A great library was scattered .
When the victors desired to know what the books might be no man capable of explaining their contents had been left alive .
No doubt everything was burnt .
The multitude of images used in Medieval Buddhist worship always inflamed the fanaticism of Muslim warriors to such fury that no quarter was given to the idolators .
The ashes of the Buddhist sanctuaries at Sarnath near Benares still bear witness to the rage of the image breakers .
Many noble monuments of the ancient civilization of India were irretrievably wrecked in the course of the early Muhammadan invasions .
Those invasions were fatal to the existence of Buddhism as an organized religion in northern India , where its strength resided chiefly in Bihar and certain adjoining territories .
The monks who escaped massacre fled , and were scattered over Nepal , Tibet , and the south .
After A.D. 1200 the traces of Buddhism in upper India are faint and obscure .
Three major waves of jihad campaigns ( exclusive of the jihad conquest of Afghanistan ) which succeeded , ultimately , in establishing a permanent Muslim dominion within India , i.e. , the Delhi Sultanate , are summarized in the following discussion .
The imposition of dhimmitude upon the vanquished Hindu populations is also characterized , in brief .
The Muslim chroniclers al — Baladhuri ( in Kitab Futuh al — Buldan ) and al — Kufi ( in the Chachnama ) include enough isolated details to establish the overall nature of the conquest of Sindh by Muhammad b. Qasim in 712 C.E . [ 6 ]
These narratives , and the processes they describe , make clear that the Arab invaders intended from the outset to Islamize Sindh by conquest , colonization , and local conversion .
Baladhuri , for example , records that following the capture of Debal , Muhammad b. Qasim earmarked a section of the city exclusively for Muslims , constructed a mosque , and established four thousand colonists there . [ 7 ]
The conquest of Debal had been a brutal affair , as summarized from the Muslim sources by Majumdar . [ 8 ]
Despite appeals for mercy from the besieged Indians ( who opened their gates after the Muslims scaled the fort walls ) , Muhammad b. Qasim declared that he had no orders ( i.e. , from his superior al — Hajjaj , the Governor of Iraq ) to spare the inhabitants , and thus for three days a ruthless and indiscriminate slaughter ensued .
In the aftermath , the local temple was defiled , and ' 700 beautiful females who had sought for shelter there , were all captured ' .
The capture of Raor was accompanied by a similar tragic outcome . [ 9 ]
Muhammad massacred 6000 fighting men who were found in the fort , and their followers and dependents , as well as their women and children were taken prisoners .
Sixty thousand slaves , including 30 young ladies of royal blood , were sent to Hajjaj , along with the head of Dahar [ the Hindu ruler ] .
We can now well understand why the capture of a fort by the Muslim forces was followed by the terrible jauhar ceremony ( in which females threw themselves in fire kindled by themselves ) , the earliest recorded instance of which is found in the Chachnama .
Practical , expedient considerations lead Muhammad to desist from carrying out the strict injunctions of Islamic Law [ 10 ] and the wishes of al — Hajjaj [ 11 ] by massacring the ( pagan ) infidel Hindus of Sindh .
Instead , he imposed upon the vanquished Hindus the jizya and associated restrictive regulations of dhimmitude .
As a result , the Chachnama records , ' some [ Hindus ] resolved to live in their native land , but others took flight in order to maintain the faith of their ancestors , and their horses , domestics , and other property ' [ 12 ]
Thus a lasting pattern was set that would persist , as noted by Majumdar , until the Mughal Empire collapsed at the end of Aurangzeb 's reign ( in 1707 ) , [ 13 ]
... of Muslim policy towards the subject Hindus in subsequent ages .
Something no doubt depended upon individual rulers ; some of them adopted a more liberal , others a more cruel and intolerant attitude .
But on the whole the framework remained intact , for it was based on the fundamental principle of Islamic theocracy .
It recognized only one faith , one people , and one supreme authority , acting as the head of a religious trust .
The Hindus , being infidels or non —believers , could not claim the full rights of citizens .
At the very best , they could be tolerated as dhimmis , an insulting title which connoted political inferiority ... The Islamic State regarded all non —Muslims as enemies , to curb whose growth in power was conceived to be its main interest .
The ideal preached by even high officials was to exterminate them totally , but in actual practice they seem to have followed an alternative laid down in the Qur'an [ i.e. , Q9:29 ] which calls upon Muslims to fight the unbelievers till they pay the jizya with due humility .
This was the tax the Hindus had to pay for permission to live in their ancestral homes under a Muslim ruler .
Mahmud of Ghazni , according to the British historian Sir Henry Elliot , launched some seventeen jihad campaigns into India between 1000 and his death in 1030 C.E . [ 14 ]
Utbi , Mahmud 's court historian , viewed these expeditions to India as a jihad to propagate Islam and extirpate idolatry . [ 15 ]
K.S. Lal illustrates this religious zeal to Islamize by force , as manifested during a 23 year period between 1000 and 1023 C.E. : [ 16 ]
In his first attack of frontier towns in C.E. 1000 Mahmud appointed his own governors and converted some inhabitants .
In his attack on Waihind ( Peshawar ) in 1001 — 3 , Mahmud is reported to have captured the Hindu Shahiya King Jayapal and fifteen of his principal chiefs and relations some of whom like Sukhpal , were made Musalmans .
At Bhera all the inhabitants , except those who embraced Islam , were put to the sword .
At Multan too conversions took place in large numbers , for writing about the campaign against Nawasa Shah ( converted Sukhpal ) , Utbi says that this and the previous victory ( at Multan ) were ' witnesses to his exalted state of proselytism . '
In his campaign in the Kashmir Valley ( 1015 ) Mahmud ' converted many infidels to Muhammadanism , and having spread Islam in that country , returned to Ghazni . '
In the later campaign in Mathura , Baran and Kanauj , again , many conversions took place .
While describing ' the conquest of Kanauj , ' Utbi sums up the situation thus : ' The Sultan levelled to the ground every fort ... and the inhabitants of them either accepted Islam , or took up arms against him . '
In short , those who submitted were also converted to Islam .
In Baran ( Bulandshahr ) alone 10,000 persons were converted including the Raja .
During his fourteenth invasion in 1023 C.E. Kirat , Nur , Lohkot and Lahore were attacked .
The chief of Kirat accepted Islam , and many people followed his example .
These continuous jihad campaigns were accompanied by great destruction and acts of wanton cruelty .
Utbi describes the slaughter which transpired during the attacks on Thanesar and Sirsawa :
The chief of Thanesar was ... obstinate in his infidelity and denial of Allah , so the Sultan marched against him with his valiant warriors for the purpose of planting the standards of Islam and extirpating idolatry ...
The blood of the infidels flowed so copiously that the stream was discoloured , and people were unable to drink it ...
Praise be to Allah ... for the honour he bestows upon Islam and Musalmans . [ 17 ]
[ at Sirsawa ]
The Sultan summoned the most religiously disposed of his followers , and ordered them to attack the enemy immediately .
Many infidels were consequently slain or taken prisoners in this sudden attack , and the Musalmans paid no regard to the booty till they had satiated themselves with the slaughter of the infidels ...
The friends of Allah searched the bodies of the slain for three whole days , in order to obtain booty [ 18 ]
Mahmud 's final well — known expedition in Hindustan , to Somanath in 1025 C.E. , was similarly brutal , and destructive :
Mahmud captured the place [ Somanath ] without much difficulty and ordered a general slaughter in which more than 50,000 persons are said to have perished .
The idol of Somanath was broken to pieces which were sent to Ghazni , Mecca , and Medina and cast in streets and the staircases of chief mosques to be trodden by the Muslims going there for their prayers [ 19 ]
Over 900 years apart , remarkably concordant assessments of Mahmud 's devastating exploits have been written by the renowned 11th century Muslim scholar Alberuni ( a counselor to Mahmud ) , and the contemporary Indian historian A.L. Srivastava .
First Alberuni , from about 1030 C.E. : [ 20 ]
Mahmud utterly ruined the prosperity of the country ... by which the Hindus became like atoms of dust scattered in all directions , and like a tale of old in the mouth of the people .
Their scattered remains cherish of course the most inveterate aversion towards all Muslims .
This is the reason too why Hindu sciences have retired far away from those parts of the country conquered by us , and have fled to places which our hand cannot yet reach , to Kashmir , Benares , and other places .
Srivastava in 1950 , wrote : [ 21 ]
To the Indian world of his day Mahmud was a veritable devil incarnate — a daring bandit , an avaricious plunderer , and wanton destroyer of Art .
He plundered many dozens of ... flourishing cities ; he razed to the ground great temples which were wonderful works of art ; he carried thousands of innocent women and children into slavery ; he indulged in wanton massacre practically everywhere he went ; and ... he forcibly converted hundred of ... unwilling people to Islam .
A conqueror who leaves behind desolate towns and villages and dead bodies of innocent human beings cannot be remembered by posterity by any other title .
K.S. Lal believes that by the late 12th century , Muhammad Ghauri was consummately prepared for the conquest and rule of India .
Well — elaborated theological justifications for jihad , and comprehensive writings on India 's geography and sociopolitical culture were readily available to him , complementing his powerful army of Turks , Persians , and Afghans .
He now possessed Alberuni's India and Burhanuddin 's Hidayah , works which were not available to his predecessor invader .
Alberuni's enecyclopedic work provided to the Islamic world in the eleventh century all that was militarily advantageous to know about India .
Equally important was the Hidayah , the most authentic work on the laws of Islam compiled by Shaikh Burhanuddin Ali in the twelfth century .
These and similar works , and the military manuals like the Siyasat Nama and Adab — ul — Harb , made the Ghauris and their successors better equipped for the conquest and governance of non —Muslim India .
There need be no doubt that such works were made available , meticulously studied and constantly referred to by scholars attached to the courts of Muslim conquerors and kings . [ 22 ]
Muhammad Ghauri launched his first expeditions against Multan and Gujarat ( in 1175 and 1178 C.E. , respectively ) .
By 1191—92 C.E. , following Ghauri 's defeat of a Rajput confederation under Prithviraj Chauhan ( and Prithviraj Chauhan 's death ) ,
Sirsuti , Samana , Kuhram , and Hansi were captured in quick succession with ruthless slaughter and a general destruction of temples , and their replacement by mosques .
The Sultan then proceeded to Ajmer which too witnessed similar scenes .
In Delhi an army of occupation was stationed at Indraprastha under the command of Qutub — ud — din Aibak who was to act as Ghauri 's lieutenant in Hindustan .
Later on Aibak became the first Sultan of Delhi [ 23 ]
Qutub — ud — din Aibak 's accession in 1206 ( consistent with Muhammad Ghauri 's desires and plans ) , marks the founding of the Delhi Sultanate .
Finally , the imposition of Islamic law upon the Hindu populations of India , i.e. , their relegation to dhimmi status , beginning with the advent of Muslim rule in 8th century Sindh , had predictable consequences during both the Delhi Sultanate period ( 1206 — 1526 C.E. ) , and the Mughal Empire ( 1526 — 1707 C.E. ) .
A.L. Srivastava highlights these germane features of Hindu status during the Delhi Sultanate : [ 24 ]
Throughout the period of the Sultanate of Delhi , Islam was the religion of the State .
It was considered to be the duty of the Sultan and his government to defend and uphold the principles of this religion and to propagate them among the masses ... even the most enlightened among them [ the Sultans ] , like Muhammad bin Tughlaq , upheld the principles of their faith and refused permission to repair Hindu ( or Buddhist ) temples ... Thus even during the reign of the so — called liberal — minded Sultans , the Hindus had no permission to build new temples or to repair old ones .
Throughout the period , they were known as dhimmis , that is , people living under guarantee , and the guarantee was that they would enjoy restricted freedom in following their religion if they paid the jizya .
The dhimmis were not to celebrate their religious rites openly ... and never to do any propaganda on behalf of their religion .
A number of disabilities were imposed upon them in matters of State employment and enjoyment of civic rights ...
It was a practice with the Sultans to destroy the Hindu temples and images therein .
Firoz Tughlaq and Sikander Lodi prohibited Hindus from bathing at the ghats [ river bank steps for ritual bathers ] in the sacred rivers , and encouraged them in every possible way to embrace the Muslim religion .
The converts were exempted from the jizya and given posts in the State service and even granted rewards in cash , or by grant of land .
In short , there was not only no real freedom for the Hindus to follow their religion , but the state followed a policy of intolerance and persecution .
The contemporary Muslim chronicles abound in detailed descriptions of desecration of images and destruction of temples and of the conversion of hundreds and thousands of the Hindus .
[ Hindu ] religious buildings and places bear witness to the iconoclastic zeal of the Sultans and their followers .
One has only to visit Ajmer , Mathura , Ayodhya , Banaras and other holy cities to see the half broken temples and images of those times with their heads , faces , hands and feet defaced and demolished .
Majumdar sees a continuum between the Delhi Sultanate and the subsequent Mughal Empire , regarding the status of the Hindus : [ 25 ]
So far as the Hindus were concerned , there was no improvement either in their material and moral conditions or in their relations with the Muslims .
With the sole exception of Akbar , who sought to conciliate the Hindus by removing some of the glaring evils to which they were subjected , almost all other Mughal Emperors were notorious for their religious bigotry .
The Muslim law which imposed many disabilities and indignities upon the Hindus ... and thereby definitely gave them an inferior social and political status , as compared to the Muslims , was followed by these Mughal Emperors ( and other Muslim rulers ) with as much zeal as was displayed by their predecessors , the Sultans of Delhi .
The climax was reached during the reign of Aurangzeb , who deliberately pursued the policy of destroying and desecrating Hindu temples and idols with a thoroughness unknown before or since .
Majumdar also makes this interesting juxtaposition of Hindu cultural advancement under the lengthy period of Muslim colonial rule , compared to the much shorter interval of British colonial rule : [ 26 ]
Judged by a similar standard , the patronage and cultivation of Hindu learning by the Muslims , or their contribution to the development of Hindu culture during their rule ... pales into insignificance when compared with the achievements of the British rule ...
It is only by instituting such comparison that we can make an objective study of the condition of the Hindus under Muslim rule , and view it in its true perspective .

The popular notion that after the conquest of Muhammad Ghauri , India formed a Muslim Empire under various dynasties , is hardly borne out by facts ... barring the two very short lived empires under the Khaljis and Muhammad bin Tughlaq which lasted respectively , for less than twenty and ten years , there was no Turkish empire of India .
The Delhi Sultanate , as the symbol of this empire , continued in name throughout the period under review [ i.e. , 1206 — 1526 ] but , gradually shorn of power and prestige , it was reduced to a phantom by the invasion of Timur at the end of the fourteenth century A.D .

In the end , the bill sailed through its first reading in the Duma , passing by a vote of 388 to 58 .
Fifty - seven of those votes were from Communists , who unanimously opposed the change .
The measure must pass two more readings in the lower house , and also be approved by majorities in the upper house and Russia ’s regional parliaments .

Russians were taken by surprise last week when their new president , Dmitri A. Medvedev proposed the term extension , the first substantial amendment to Russia ’s Constitution since it was adopted in 1993 .
The longer presidential term would apply to Mr. Medvedev only if he were re-elected , and speculation abounded that he was paving the way for his powerful predecessor , Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin , to return to the presidency  perhaps before Mr. Medvedev ’s four years are up .
In an interview with the French newspaper Figaro this week , Mr. Medvedev was asked whether he might leave office before 2012 .
“ I am in the process of working right now , ” Mr. Medvedev answered .
“ Why are you pushing me into certain decisions ?
I can say only one thing for sure , and that is that the new terms will benefit only whoever is elected to the office of the president once the necessary amendments have entered into force . ”
Mr. Putin , still Russia ’s most popular politician , said that he supported the change and that it had “ no personality dimension . ”

This year saw the first commercial planting of genetically modified ( GM ) sugar beets in the United States , with that sugar to hit the food supply soon after .
Farmers across the country will soon be planting Monsanto 's Roundup Ready sugar beet , genetically engineered for resistance to Monsanto 's herbicide glyphosate ( marketed as Roundup ) .
John Schorr , agriculture manager for Amalgamated Sugar , estimates that 95 percent of the sugar beet crop in Idaho will be of the new GM variety in 2008 , or a total of 150,000 out of 167,000 acres .
Approximately 1.4 million acres of sugar beets are planted in the United States each year , primarily in Minnesota and North Dakota 's Red River Valley , as well as the Pacific Northwest , Great Plains and Great Lakes areas .
In response to the anticipated flood of GM sugar onto the food market , the consumer group Citizens for Health has launched an email campaign to pressure three major sugar and candy companies to refuse the new product .
In 2001 , American Crystal Sugar , Hershey 's and M&M Mars all promised that they would not use GM sugar ; Citizens for Health is asking consumers to email those companies from the group 's Web site and urge them to keep that promise .
" Since half of the granulated sugar in the U.S. comes from sugar beets , the infiltration of GE sugar beets represents a significant alteration of our food supply , " Citizens for Health says on its Web site .
" Unlike traditional breeding , genetic engineering creates new life forms that would never occur in nature , creating new and unpredictable health and environmental risks .
"
In 1999 , candy companies ' refusal to purchase GM sugar scuttled Monsanto 's first attempt to introduce Roundup Ready sugar beets
On another front , a coalition of farmer and environmental groups is seeking to block the planting of the GM beets through a federal lawsuit .
The plaintiffs in the case - the Center for Food Safety , High Mowing Organic Seeds , the Organic Seed Alliance and the Sierra Club - are represented by lawyers from the Center for Food Safety and Earthjustice .
In 2005 , the U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) changed the classification of Roundup Ready sugar beets from regulated to deregulated , meaning that the GM beets could be planted without a special permit .
But the lawsuit alleges that the USDA failed to properly conduct an environmental review into the impacts of this deregulation .
"
The law requires the government to take a hard look at the impact that deregulating Roundup Ready sugar beets will have on human health , agriculture and the environment , " said Greg Loarie of Earthjustice .
" The government cannot simply ignore the fact that deregulation will harm organic farmers and consumers , and exacerbate the growing epidemic of herbicide resistant weeds .
" Critics point out that Roundup Ready crops encourage increased chemical use , with dangerous effects on both human health and the environment .
In addition to contaminating soil and water , pesticides leave potentially dangerous residue on food plants themselves .
Citizens for Health says that this is a particular concern in light of the Environmental Protection Agency 's recent compliance with a Monsanto request to increase the allowable levels of glyphosate residue on sugar beet roots by 5000 percent .
" Sugar is extracted from the beet 's root , and the result is more glyphosate pesticide in our sugar , " the group said .
Another concern is that such plants encourage the development of " superweeds " that are resistant to Roundup .
" Just as overuse of antibiotics eventually breeds drug resistant bacteria , overuse of Roundup eventually breeds Roundup - resistant weeds , " said Kevin Golden of the Center for Food Safety .
" When that happens , farmers are forced to rely on even more toxic herbicides to control those weeds .
" USDA data reveals that in the 10 years after the 1994 introduction of Roundup Ready crops , herbicide use increased by 15 times .
This has led to a concurrent increase in superweeds .
While no cases of Roundup - resistant weeds were known in the U.S. corn belt in 2000 , this year the roster of such weeds includes marestail , common and giant ragweed , waterhemp , Palmer pigweed , Cocklebur , lambsquarters , morning glory and velvetleaf .
Ninety - nine percent of U.S. superweeds are resistant to Roundup .
GM crops may also cross - breed with non-GM plants of the same or closely related species .
The primary seed - growing region for sugar beets - the Willamette Valley of Oregon - is also a major seed - growing area for the closely related organic chard and table beets .
Since all these species are wind pollinated , the chances of contamination are very high .
" Contamination from genetically modified pollen is a major risk to both the conventional and organic seed farmers , who have a long history in the Willamette Valley , " said Matthew Dillon , director of advocacy for the Organic Seed Alliance .
" The economic impact of contamination affects not only these seed farmers , but the beet and chard farmers who rely on the genetic integrity of their varieties .
" Crops contaminated by cross-pollination with GM varieties can no longer be certified organic .
Since corn syrup is an even more widely used sweetener than sugar and the majority of corn grown in the United States is also Roundup Ready , food safety advocates note that nearly all sweetened food in the United States will soon be GM .
Because U.S. law does not require labeling of GM ingredients , consumers of products from candy to breakfast cereal will soon be unknowingly exposed to engineered sugar , with unknown health consequences .
" As a consumer , I 'm very concerned about genetically engineered sugar making its way into the products I eat , " Neil Carman of the Sierra Club said .

A year or two ago , if you 'd told me that Barack Obama would be leading John McCain by a seemingly comfortable margin with two weeks to go and asked me what , in their desperation , the Republicans would be talking about to try and scare my fellow Americans into voting against him , I 'd have said race .
After all , Republicans have race - baited in one form or other in most of our presidential contests since Richard Nixon 's time , so it would have seemed impossible to me that they 'd miss the chance to do so at a time when Democrats had actually gone to the trouble of nominating an African - American candidate .
It 's true that we 're hearing racial - code talk here and there .
But the main fear tactic being employed now is something else .
It 's that Obama and his associates - and for that matter his supporters and even the regions of the country that he 's destined to carry - are anti-American . '
Last Friday , in North Carolina , Sarah Palin told a rally that she was proud to be " with all of you hard - working , very patriotic , um , very , um , pro-America areas of this great nation " .
She means here of course that there are anti-American areas of America , and they are where the liberals live , and the people there are voting for Mr Anti-America .
This was especially interesting coming from a woman whose husband , Todd Palin , was until just six years ago an enrolled member of a rightwing fringe political party that wanted the state of Alaska to secede from the US .
But if you understand rightwing logic , then you 'd know that Mr Palin had no choice but to join the Alaska Independence party in 1995 , because by that time the America he thought he knew and loved had been brought to ruin by the liberals and socialists and America - haters .
See ?
Likewise , earlier this month , Joe McCain , the brother of John , said that Alexandria and Arlington , the two major cities in the northern Virginia suburbs that lie just across the Potomac River from Washington , were " communist country " as far as he was concerned .
His brother lives in Arlington when in the nation 's capital for work , and his brother 's campaign is headquartered there as well , but never mind .
A McCain spokeswoman offered a wan apology at the time , but lo and behold , just last Saturday a different McCain spokes - woman said on television that while Obama would perform well in northern Virginia , " the rest of the state - real Virginia if you will - I think will be very responsive to Senator McCain 's message " .
This did not seem a planned one - liner .
The spokeswoman made the fatal error of saying what she actually thinks .
Republican Virginia equals real Virginia .
Democratic Virginia is alien and impure .
Do you folks do this sort of thing in Britain ?
I know there 's something about the chap on the Clapham omnibus who 's supposed to represent some kind of middling everyman .
And I know you 've got your xenophobes just like we do .
But trust me .
You do n't have a right wing that 's anything like our right wing .
This point was proved most dramatically by a woman named Michele Bachmann , a member of Congress from Minnesota .
In an interview last Friday on Hardball , a leading US cable talk show , host Chris Matthews asked Bachmann whether Obama worried her .
" Absolutely .
I 'm very concerned that he may have anti-American views , " she said .
He asked her what she thought distinguished liberal from hard left from anti-American .
If she maintains such distinctions in her mind , she refused to acknowledge them .
Then , finally , Matthews - who deftly fed her the rope to hang herself - asked her how many members of the US Congress held , in her view , anti-American views .
It 's been almost a two - year campaign .
There have been moments we 've thought of as memorable , only to see the tide of events erase their mark from the sand .
Bachmann 's answer , however , will live imperishably : " What I would say - what I would say is that the news media should do a penetrating exposé and take a look .
I wish they would .
I wish the American media would take a great look at the views of the people in Congress and find out , are they pro-America or anti-America ?
I think people would love to see an exposé like that . "
Before we go any further - who is this Bachmann ?
She 's a first - term backbencher from exurban Minneapolis who says the Lord told her to run for Congress .
She declared herself " a fool for Christ " in 2006 when she announced her candidacy .
By all accounts she 's down with the whole rightwing Christian package : immigrants bring disease and pestilence , homosexuals want to indoctrinate straight children , and so on .
Republican leadership undoubtedly pushed her out on to television because she is , as you Brits say , a looker - at least by the standards of Congress .
The call for an investigation into the beliefs of every federal lawmaker , and an exposé of those found wanting in their patriotism , certainly takes us into deeply creepy territory .
I would not call Bachmann herself a fascist .
Odd as it sounds , to do so would be to grant her far too much credit .
For one to embrace an - ism , even a repugnant one , one needs to have read a certain amount of history and political philosophy .
Bachmann is just an idiot .
She would n't know Edmund Burke from Billie Burke ( she played the good witch in the Wizard of Oz ) , and she obviously has no idea that , in her rejection of the two bedrock American principles of separation of church and state and freedom of thought , she is the one who is as anti-American as they come .
But friends , all is not darkness .
Bachmann 's appearance caused a national uproar .
Colin Powell , in endorsing Obama yesterday , said of Bachmann 's comments that " we have got to stop this kind of nonsense and pull ourselves together " .
Her Democratic opponent raised nearly half a million dollars from around the country in just 24 hours , and he now has a chance of beating her .
That would be nice .
But let 's go back to the big contest .
With Bachmann , the lid came off the rightwing id .
It will happen many more times over these next two weeks .
McCain , now openly using the word " socialist " to describe Obama 's proposals ( the week after his friend George W Bush took federal control of nine major banks ! ) , and especially Palin have shown every sign of encouraging it .
Their goal is to scare Americans about Obama , but moderate , independent voters might well decide that Obama looks a lot less scary than they do .

Is reality that different up in Alaska ?
Sarah Palin said she did nothing wrong when she clearly violated ethics laws .
Now Ted Stevens says he was n’t convicted .
Huh ?
From the Anchorage Daily News :
With just four days before the election and Alaska Sen .
Ted Stevens insisting he ’s not a felon , the U.S. Senate race is white hot .
“ I ’ve not been convicted yet , ” Stevens said Thursday in a meeting with the editorial board of the Fairbanks Daily News - Miner .
“ There ’s not a black mark by my name yet , until the appeal is over and I am finally convicted , if that happens .
If that happens , of course I ’ll do what ’s right for Alaska and for the Senate . …
I do n’t anticipate it happening , and until it happens I do not have a black mark . ”
Stevens reiterated that position during a televised debate late Thursday night , declaring early in the give - and - take with Anchorage Mayor Mark Begich , “ I have not been convicted of anything . “
But wait , I thought Ted Stevens was convicted and even Republicans were asking him to resign ?
Seems that the Anchorage Daily News is living in the same world I am :
A Washington , D.C. , jury Monday convicted Stevens of seven felony counts of lying on financial disclosure forms about thousands of dollars of gifts and home renovations from Veco Corp .
…
Senate Republicans including minority leader McConnell have said Stevens should resign .
So has Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin , the Republican vice presidential nominee , and her running mate , John McCain .
Ted Stevens has completely lost it .
How can anyone in Alaska vote for a convicted felon ?
Help Mark Begich defeat Stevens and bring Alaska back into reality .
UPDATE : DailyKos has recent polling info from Alaska .
PITY poor irony .
Declared dead after 9/11 , it staged a strong rally beneath a “ Mission Accomplished ” banner , only to find itself in mortal danger once again .
Its ill health was noted by , among others , no less an ironist than Joan Didion , the nation ’s poet laureate of disillusion .
The week after the election , in a talk at the New York Public Library , Ms. Didion lamented that the United States in the era of Barack Obama had become an “ irony - free zone , ” a vast Kool - Aid tank where “ naïveté , translated into ‘ hope , ’ was now in ” and where “ innocence , even when it looked like ignorance , was now prized . ”
Who ’d want to live in a world like that ?
But are ironic sensibilities like Ms. Didion ’s — the detachment of mind , the appreciation of the folly of taking things at face value — really disappearing ?
Not according to the conservative humorist P. J. O’Rourke , who reported from his New Hampshire office on Wednesday that he was finishing a piece for The Weekly Standard with the working title , “ Is It Too Soon to Start Talking About the Failed Obama Presidency Just Because He Is n’t President Yet ? ”
A British father who raped his two daughters repeatedly for more than 25 years and had nine children by them has been sentenced to life in jail .
Sheffield crown court heard today how the 56 - year - old , who can not be named for legal reasons , " took pleasure " in knowing the harm he was doing to his two girls and threatened them with a " real hiding " if they refused to have sex with him .
The defendant , from Sheffield , admitted last month to 25 rapes and four indecent assaults .
He received 25 life sentences and will serve a minimum of 19 and a half years .
His elder daughter was pregnant seven times by him and gave birth to four of his children although two of them died on the day they were born .
He made his younger daughter pregnant 12 times .
She has five surviving children , the court heard .
The man , who called himself the " gaffer " , also had a son who lived with them until his teenage years .
The victims were too frightened to tell anyone , even their mother .
Judge Goldsack , passing the 25 life sentences , said said : " The phrase ' it is difficult to imagine a worse case ' is much overused and rarely , if ever , true .
I am not going to say no case of rape within a family situation will ever come to light .
" But I can say that in nearly 40 years of dealing with criminal cases and 14 as a family judge the combination of aggravating circumstances here is the worst I have come across . "
The two sisters started being abused at the age of eight but only realised the other was also being assaulted when they became pregnant some years later , the court heard .
Nicholas Campbell QC said : " All the defendant 's children spoke of his domination over their family life .
He was tall and strongly built .
" I quote him : he was ' the main gaffer ' , he called himself the gaffer and he liked to think that he was a hard man .
The court heard the daughters were raped every three days at times .
Mr Campbell said : " One sister would babysit the other children while the other was being raped .
" One of them did try to offer him £ 100 a month to stop and paid it from her child benefit .
That went on for two to three months . "
Apart from that the only time the defendant would stop raping his daughters was after they had either given birth or suffered a miscarriage or termination .
South Yorkshire police and Sheffield council said they were satisfied the offender has received the maximum possible punishment for his acts .
A spokesman for the police appealed for the public and media to respect the family and allow them to try to continue their lives after a trauma he " could not begin to imagine " .
During the hearing Campbell told the court : " All the family were frightened of him .
When they heard his car pulling up outside the house , the children and their mother ran to their respective rooms .
" His son described him as having a Jekyll and Hyde personality and that his dad had a one - second fuse and that he could flip and turn with the click of his fingers . "
Campbell said : " His younger daughter told of the frightening habit her father had of putting her head next to the flames of their gas fire and that when she struggled to get away on certain occasions she burnt her eyes .
" The sisters recall that they were kept from school when they bore physical injuries .
The defendant also ensured that his family were kept isolated and that there were very few visitors to the home .
" Rather than having babysitters , the children recall being locked in their rooms when their mother and father went out .
" Even then there was speculation and talk from the neighbours about the growing family but the lack of any other men apart from the man who called himself the grandfather . "
In 1988 the victims ' school became suspicious about their injuries but these were blamed on bullying .
In the early 1990s the defendant moved with his two daughters , wife and son from South Yorkshire to Lincolnshire where they lived in isolated small villages .
Shortly after the move his wife left him .
The father continued to share a council house with his two daughters and son but he made the teenage boy sleep on the landing outside the bedrooms he shared with his victims .
The court heard that one way the defendant prevented his children from alerting the police or social services was by telling them they would have their children taken from them .
He also threatened to kill them .
His younger daughter was kicked and punched during one incident in 1998 for meeting the son of one of her neighbours .
He then attacked his eldest daughter , holding a knife to her throat , before claiming : " It 's never going to end .
You have to do what you are told . "
The women then called Childline and asked for a guarantee that they could keep their children but when one was not offered they ended the call .
Whenever the sisters were challenged about the paternity of their children they did their best to cover it up , Campbell told the court .
He said : " They started taking the pill .
He said they should not be taking it and , just as they felt unable to avoid his sexual abuse , they obeyed .
" They spoke of his pleasure at fathering their children whilst at the same time they had fears for the welfare of these children and how they would cope . "
In 50 % of cases where a father and child or brother and sister have a baby , severe illness , premature death or learning disabilities will occur .
The court heard that on a number of occasions doctors advised the women to stop having children by the same father .
At one stage towards the end of the abuse , the defendant offered his younger daughter £ 500 to have another child with him .
The court heard that they tried to give their father as much whisky as he wanted so he would drink himself to death .
But it was not until last summer that the younger daughter managed to flee her father 's grasp .
The case is already being compared with the Austrian rapist Josef Fritzl , who kept his daughter locked in a dungeon for 24 years as he fathered seven children with her .
It 's a safe bet , dear reader , that the title of this column has caused you to either ( a ) roll your eyes and wonder , What century do you think we 're living in ?
or ( b ) scratch your head and ask , Yes , why do n't we ?
Wherever you come down , the question defines a fault line in the civilized world 's view about the latest encroachment of barbarism .
Year - to - date , Somalia - based pirates have attacked more than 90 ships , seized more than 35 , and currently hold 17 .
Some 280 crew members are being held hostage , and two have been killed ....
Note that some of these are explained in much more detail in the tutorial .
To get a rough overview of how to use the library you can see the following heavily commented examples : hello world - A program that just does a " Hello World " .
cat -
A program that just transfers information from stdin to stdout ... mmap( ) is never used .
nl - This does something similar to the Unix " nl " program .
Each input line is printed along with a number .
This uses the split functions to get each line .
hexdump -
An ASCII hexdump utility , it prints in the " programmer " format of 16 bytes per line with Hex first , and then ASCII .
High ASCII characters are printed , or not depending on a configuration .
This also uses mmap ( ) on the input files , if possible .
lookup_ip - A program that will change a DNS domain name ( Ie. www.and.org) into an IP v4 address ( or print an error ) .
This uses the std. custom formatter for printing IP v4 addresses .
gmp_factorials -
A program that will output each factorial leading upto a number supplied on the cmd line .
This creates a custom formatter for printing GMP mpz_t variables .
To get a better understanding , there are other example programs which are n't as heavily commented but should show how you can solve certain problems .
They are : rot13 - This does a rot13 transform ( or Caesar cipher ) on the input , and then outputs it .
This shows the different methods you can use for iterating through a string .
You can also use it to measure the differences between those methods .
yes -
This just shows text repeatedly , it does show the difference between the different methods of copying data between Vstr strings .
You can use this program to measure those copying affects .
One minor note is that it does allow you to use the string " - - version " as the output ... which the GNU version does n't ( as of fileutils - 2.0.12 ) .
csv -
This is a csv parser I wrote for a thread on comp.lang .c.
I 'll probably turn into a library function at some point , but for now it 's useful on it's own .
monitor copy -
This program will monitor a file as it gets bigger , and report Bytes per second etc. statistics .
This is done through Vstr string custom formatter API calls , and should show how much simpler you can make your code using those features .
slowcat ( this also requires the Timer_q library , and getopt_long ) -
This is like the cat program , except that you can specify a delay between blocks of output ... this is especially useful for ASCII art programs .
C to html converter - This program implements something similar to , but just for C , this is used to turn the tutorial examples into html .
Simple Server Side Includes processor -
This program implements something similar to Apache httpd SSI , but it only does the include statement .
I use this to generate some documentation .
HTTP /1.1 server - Serves static files over HTTP / 1.1 , this shows off Vstr how it was designed to be used ... as a non-blocking IO server .
Scatter gather comparison ( this also requires the OpenSSL library ) -
This program times the usage of the MD5 or SHA1 functions from OpenSSL , with a all of : A single chunk of data , an iovec list of the data at the default buffer size , and an iovec list of the data at a configured buffer size .
This was written to disprove the theory that iovec lists are always too slow to use , I believe I did this , assuming you have a chunk size that is n't tiny ( and the default chunk size is probably good enough ) .
Adding data to Vstr comparison -
This program times the overhead of adding data to a Vstr , in a few different ways .
Note that the hand optimized way depends on internals that are n't guaranteed by the API , however the hand iovec method is basically as fast and only uses the documented API ( this is n't surprising in my opinion , as the library was designed with the idea that the performance critical data would be comming in through iovecs ) .
All of the examples can be seen HERE .
For the truly adventurous the " make check " test suite root is HERE ( NOTE : the test suite is written to try and break the Vstr string library , so although it uses all of the APIs it may not be code you want to copy and paste into your programs / libraries -- however given that everything in the test suite works , you know that those uses do work ) .
However do note that a couple of the tests do use undocumentation members of structs etc. , and you still should n't use those .
There is also a " port " of the vsftpd FTP server to use the Vstr string library .
It can be found here .
This was mainly an experiment in how well / easily Vstr would work inside an application designed for a traditional String API model .
Well , now that the Republican governors have snubbed Sarah Palin when selecting their leadership group in Miami , it 's semi-official that the bloom has slightly faded from Palin 's rose -- and not a moment too soon .
Which means the GOP is going to start looking a little more seriously for leadership in the coming four years to help lift it out of the miasma in which it is now deservedly enveloped .
But look at that list :
South Carolina Gov. Mark Sanford was voted RGA chairman , taking over the top job from Texas Gov. Rick Perry who will now serve as finance chairman .
Mississippi Gov. Haley Barbour is vice - chairman , while Florida Gov. Charlie Crist will serve as chair for the annual RGA gala , and Georgia Gov. Sonny Perdue will head up the recruitment effort .
Well , as much as the South 's political power was diminished in the last election , it 's pretty plain that the GOP for the foreseeable future is the Party of the South .
Out of this group , Barbour 's name is perhaps the one we 've heard most frequently on the tips of right - wing talking - head tongues .
But Barbour has quite the checkered history :
He 's notorious for ardently promoting the Confederate flag and consorting with the white - supremacist Council of Conservative Citizens -- and he does so unapologetically .
So if Barbour does emerge a serious party leader , it will mean the GOP has thoroughly embraced its Cro-Magnon , neo -Confederate wing , and the dog - whistle rabble - rousing we saw from McCain and Palin in 2008 will look positively civil in comparison .
Another name not on this list , but frequently mentioned ( and yet another Southern governor ) is that of Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal .
Ezra Klein has a good piece at TAP about Jindal :
Chief among the prospects is Louisiana 's Bobby Jindal , a former Rhodes Scholar and health policy bureaucrat who 's taking a step into health care innovation today with a major proposal to reform how Louisian 's Medicaid system works .
There 's one problem with all this : Jindal 's actual record as governor , particularly as he 's tried to enact " conservative " reforms in education , health care , and housing , has been nothing short of disastrous , a classic case of the calamitous effects of conservative governance .
Isaiah Poole at FDL had the rundown earlier this year , describing how Jindal 's " reforms " have done nothing but deepen the misery of Katrina - struck Louisianans , particularly those in New Orleans :
The American Prospect 's Mori Dinauer uncovered this note of praise of Jindal from Rush Limbaugh : " Bobby Jindal , the new governor of Louisiana , is the next Ronald Reagan . "
The title fits , given Reagan 's disdain for the poor and for people of color .
( Though it 's unlikely that Reagan ever included performing exorcisms on his resume . )
Add Jindal 's unconditional opposition to abortion under any circumstances ( 15 years old and raped ?
Tough . ) , his support for teaching the doctrine of " intelligent design " in public schools and his opposition to civil rights protections for gay and lesbian people , and you have a perfect storm of ideological disaster for the New Orleans and the state .
But , like Reagan , Jindal can be smooth , charming and even disarming .
As the shock of Katrina recedes from the collective memory and as the recovery effort continues to boil in a murky stew of inertia , Jindal is well equipped to be the next great facade for conservatism — as long as no one is asking questions about what 's behind the front .
Sounds like the Republicans ' kind of guy .
NASA engineers have finally tested an " interplanetary Internet " that could be crucial for future communications with rovers and astronauts exploring the moon , Mars , or other planets .
NASA says the system would rely on probes and orbiters to serve as relay stations , or routers , to send communications around the solar system .
The space agency has been working for 10 years on the project with Vint Cerf , one of the Internet 's key inventors and now chief Internet evangelist for Google [ AP ] .
The protocols ( the language computers use to speak to each other ) used for our terrestrial Internet wo n't work for deep space , because they assume that the network 's nodes will be connected continuously , and that messages will travel swiftly .
But communication between objects in space are frequently disrupted by solar storms and obstructing planets , and sending a message from Earth to Mars can take up to 20 minutes .
So engineers at NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory worked with Cerf to come up with a new protocol , called Disruption - Tolerant Networking ( DTN ) .
With the new communications design , each network node is designed to hold onto data packets , instead of discard them , until a destination path can be found .
" The incentive to use Internet - like protocols over space links was to take advantage of automated routing , " [ said NASA 's Leigh Torgerson ] .
" With standard space - link communications , the ground sends commands to spacecraft to tell it what time and what data to send .
It 's very hands - on - intensive " [ Computerworld ] .
NASA team leader Adrian Hooke says engineers started out by testing the DTN system in earthly scenarios .
Hooke said the protocol has been used by Laplanders herding reindeer on snowmobiles , as well as cell - phone users on the bleeding edges of their coverage areas .
It 's even being deployed by the Pentagon for battlefield communications .
" There 's quite a community now , the happy band of delay - tolerant networkers , " Hooke told me [ MSNBC ] .
Then , this October , NASA tested the system using
the EPOXI spacecraft , currently on a two - year outbound cruise to a comet rendezvous .
The spacecraft is in communication , using DTN , with nine ground stations at the JPL , designed to simulate a Mars relay network with orbiters , landers , and earthbound nodes [ Ars Technica ] .
From 20 million miles away , the spacecraft sent back images without any hitches , officials say .

VERNON , Ala . —
Fear of the politician with the unusual name and look did not end with last Tuesday ’s vote in this rural red swatch where buck heads and rifles hang on the wall .
This corner of the Deep South still resonates with negative feelings about the race of President - elect Barack Obama .
What may have ended on Election Day , though , is the centrality of the South to national politics .
By voting so emphatically for Senator John McCain over Mr. Obama — supporting him in some areas in even greater numbers than they did President Bush — voters from Texas to South Carolina and Kentucky may have marginalized their region for some time to come , political experts say .
The region ’s absence from Mr. Obama ’s winning formula means it “ is becoming distinctly less important , ” said Wayne Parent , a political scientist at Louisiana State University .
“ The South has moved from being the center of the political universe to being an outside player in presidential politics . ”
One reason for that is that the South is no longer a solid voting bloc .
Along the Atlantic Coast , parts of the “ suburban South , ” notably Virginia and North Carolina , made history last week in breaking from their Confederate past and supporting Mr. Obama .
Those states have experienced an influx of better educated and more prosperous voters in recent years , pointing them in a different political direction than states farther west , like Alabama , Arkansas , Louisiana and Mississippi , and Appalachian sections of Kentucky and Tennessee .

The Nimitz - class aircraft carriers were the largest warships ever built until the commissioning of USS Gerald R Ford in 2017 .
With over 6,000 personnel ( crew and aircrew ) , the carrier has a displacement of 102,000t and a flight deck length of 332.9m .
All ten nuclear - powered Nimitz - class carriers were built by Huntington Ingalls Industries Newport News Shipbuilding ( now Northrop Grumman Ship Systems ) based in Virginia .
Tasked with a multi-mission attack / ASW role , the first of class , USS Nimitz , was commissioned in 1975 .
The last of the class , USS George HW Bush ( CVN 77 ) , was commissioned in January 2009 .
Nimitz - class carriers
Other hulls include USS Dwight D Eisenhower ( CVN 69 ) – October 1977 ; USS Carl Vinson ( CVN 70 ) – March 1982 ; USS Theodore Roosevelt ( CVN 71 ) – October 1986 ; USS Abraham Lincoln ( CVN 72 ) – November 1989 ; USS George Washington ( CVN 73 ) , July 1992 ; USS John C Stennis ( CVN 74 ) – December 1995 , USS Harry S Truman ( CVN 75 ) – July 1998 and USS Ronald Reagan ( CVN 76 ) – July 2003 .
USS Ronald Reagan ( CVN 76 ) made its first operational deployment between January and May 2006 , in support of Operation Iraqi Freedom and Enduring Freedom in the Arabian Gulf .
In September 2008 , USS George Washington ( CVN 73 ) arrived at its new homeport of Yokosuka , Japan .
It replaced USS Kitty Hawk , which was decommissioned in May 2009 , as the flagship of the US 7th fleet .
The keel for the tenth and last Nimitz - class , USS George HW Bush ( CVN 77 ) , was laid in September 2003 .
The carrier was christened in October 2006 and entered service in 2009 .
The vessel has a modernised island house with a new radar tower and transparent armour windows , as well as upgraded navigation and communications systems .
It has a new aircraft launch and recovery system and JP - 5 fuel system for improved storage and aircraft fuel handling .
It is the first transition ship to a new class of carriers , Gerald R Ford ( CVN 78 ) ( also known as CVN 21 and CVNX ) , commissioned in July 2017 .
Huntington Ingalls Industries Newport News Shipbuilding is the prime contractor for the programme and Raytheon is responsible for weapons system integration .
CVN 78 incorporates new technologies , including a new multi-function radar system , volume search radar and open architecture information network , providing a significantly reduced crew requirement and a new nuclear power plant .
Nimitz - class carrier design
The more recent Nimitz - class carriers ( CVN72 - CVN76 ) have a displacement of 102,000t when fully loaded .
They have a length of 317 m and beam of 40.8 m .
The carrier reaches a maximum speed of over 30 k and can accommodate 3,184 personnel ( with 203 officers ) , 2,800 aircrew ( with 366 officers ) and 70 flag ( with 25 officers ) .
Nimitz - class aircraft details
The 50 TACAIR air wing includes up to 82 aircraft .
Typically this would be 12 F / A - 18E / F Hornets , 36 F/ A - 18 Hornets , four E - 2C Hawkeyes and four EA - 6B Prowlers fixed - wing and helicopters , including four SH - 60 F and two HH - 60H Seahawks .
The carrier can also deploy S - 3B Viking aircraft , but these were phased out and replaced with the F / A - 18E / F Super Hornet .
The S - 3B Viking was finally decommissioned in January 2009 .
“ The Nimitz carrier reaches a maximum speed of over 30k . ”
The last operational deployment of the F - 14 , used in US carriers since 1972 , was in March 2006 .
The F - 14 was decommissioned in September 2006 .
Air wings can be customised according to the nature of the operation .
For example , in 1994 , 50 army helicopters replaced the usual air wing on the USS Dwight D Eisenhower during operations near Haiti .
The flight deck measures 333 m x 77 m and is equipped with four lifts , four steam - driven catapults and four arrester wires .
The carrier is capable of launching one aircraft every 20 seconds .
In April 2005 , the US Naval air systems command ( NAVAIR ) selected General Atomics Electromagnetic Systems for the system development and demonstration ( SDD ) phase of the advanced arresting gear ( AAG ) programme to provide a new arrestor system for USN carriers .
Nimitz - class missiles
The more recently built carriers are armed with three Raytheon GMLS mk29 eight - cell launchers for Nato Sea Sparrow surface - to - air missiles .
Sea Sparrow has a range of 14.5 km and semi-active radar terminal guidance .
The carriers are fitted with the Raytheon RAM ( rolling airframe missile ) system , which provides short - range defence against incoming anti-ship missiles , including sea-skimming missiles .
USS Stennis was fitted with RAM in 2005 and began firing trials of the system in June 2006 .
One Sea Sparrow mount and one Phalanx CIWS mount were removed to fit the RAM .
USS John C Stennis was the first carrier to fire the evolved Sea Sparrow missile ( ESSM ) in October 2008 .
Nimitz aircraft carrier weapons
There are four Raytheon / General Dynamics 20 mm
Phalanx six - barrelled
Mk 15 close - in weapon systems that have a firing rate of 3,000 rounds a minute and a range of 1.5 km .
Countermeasures
Decoys include four Sippican super rapid bloom off - board chaff ( SRBOC ) , six - barrelled mk36 decoy launchers , which deploy infrared flares and chaff , SSTDS torpedo defence system and AN / SLQ - 25 Nixie torpedo countermeasures system from Argon ST of Fairfax , Virginia .
The Raytheon AN / SLQ - 32 ( V ) electronic warfare system detects hostile radar emissions by two sets of antennae and the system analyses pulse repetition rate , scan mode , scan period and frequency .
The system identifies the threat and direction , provides a warning signal and interfaces to the ship ’s countermeasures systems .
Nimitz - class carrier combat systems
The carriers ’ combat data systems are based around the block 0 or 1 naval tactical and advanced combat direction system ( ACDS ) with communications links 4A , 11 , 14 and 16 .
Weapons control is managed by three mk91 mod 1 MFCS directors for the Sea Sparrow missile .
USS Nimitz , USS Ronald Reagan and USS John Stennis were fitted with the SSDS mk2 mod 0 ship self - defence system developed by Raytheon .
The SSDS will provide automated self - defence against anti-ship cruise missiles ( ASCMs ) by integrating and coordinating the ship ’s weapon and electronic warfare systems .
USS Nimitz was fitted with the Lockheed Martin TIS ( tactical input segment ) digital reconnaissance processing system , which can receive real - time imagery from airborne sensors .
Nimitz - class sensors and propulsion
Air search radars include the ITT SPS - 48E 3 - D , operating at E/F- band , Raytheon SPS49 ( V ) 5 , C/D- band and Raytheon mk23 TAS , D - band .
Surface search radar is the Northrop Grumman Norden Systems SPS - 67V , operating at G - band .
Four vessels in class , CVN 70 , CVN 73 , CVN 74 and CVN 76 , feature the AN / SPS - 74 ( V ) radar to enable tracking and detection of submarine periscopes .
The navy cancelled the programme and decided to procure AN / SPQ - 9B periscope detection capability radars for installation on the ten hulls .
The Nimitz class will also feature AN / SPY - 6 ( V ) 3 enterprise air surveillance radar ( EASR ) being developed by Raytheon .
The nuclear - powered carrier has two General Electric pressurised water reactors driving four turbines of 260,000 hp ( 194MW ) and four shafts .
There are four emergency diesels of 10,720 hp ( 8 MW ) .
Father 's fury after he is held in cells for smacking his seven - year - old son
Mark Frearson with his seven - year - old son Harry .
He said the police 's reaction was ' massively over - the - top '
A father is demanding an apology from police after he spent a night in a cell for smacking his son .
Mark Frearson , 47 , was arrested on suspicion of assault after he slapped his seven - year - old son Harry on the back of the legs .
Mr Frearson , a company director , punished his child for leaving his side and wandering off on his own in the dark .
A witness called the police and three hours after the incident , four police officers and a specialist child support officer arrived at Mr Frearson 's home in Plymouth , Devon , to question him and examine Harry for bruises .
They then drove the boy away in a police car and took his father to the station where they locked him up in a cell overnight .
Mr Frearson later found out that he should have been questioned immediately but was locked up because the ' witness ' was ' in no fit state ' to be interviewed .
He spent 12 hours in the cell but was released the next morning after the complainant withdrew the allegation .
Mr Frearson , a director of a parcel company , has now demanded an apology from police , claiming their response to the complaint was ' massively over - the - top ' .
He said : ' I appreciate the police 's concern but even if they felt they had to take Harry I am still angry and bewildered at the events .
' They seemed far too ready to presume me guilty and then cause distress to my son by taking him from me .
' I do n't understand why they felt it necessary to arrest me and lock me up before interviewing me or the witness .
' My son found himself being searched by police officer which was traumatic enough and then they took him away in a police car . '
The incident happened at 6 pm one evening last month while Harry , who usually lives with his mother Kate , 33 , was staying with his father during the half - term holiday .
They went to a local supermarket but the youngster wandered out of a shop on his own while his dad 's back was turned .
A frantic Mr Frearson found him ten minutes later in a nearby park where he smacked him once and told him never to wander off by himself .
Mr Frearson explained : ' He just disappeared from the shop .
After ten minutes walking up and down the aisles I left , to find my him outside in the dark .
A spokesman for The Parent Organization said : ' This is a classic case of police over - reacting to one complaint from some do - gooder who interfered without knowing the full picture .
( Posed by models )
' I was relieved but also angry .
I called him to me and smacked his bottom for leaving me , telling him never to do it again . '
A member of the public reported the smacking to police who later arrived at Mr Pearson 's home .
He recalled : ' There was a knock at the door and police officers asked if they could come in and could I confirm the car outside was mine , which I did .
' They then informed me they had received a report from a member of the public that a child had been assaulted .
' I told them the story of my son running off and that I had smacked him .
' They asked my son what had happened and he said ' Dad smacked me for being outside the shop ' .
' The police then examined my son for any marks and there were n't any as he had a only a smack . '
Mr Frearson said the officers examined his son by asking him to strip down to his underwear .
He said : ' They asked him to take of his shirt and trousers and looked over his body including his torso and legs .
' He 's a very shy boy and it was must have been very scary for him .
' One minute he was watching Cartoon Network and the next he was stripping in front of a policeman .
' They were clearly looking for marks but there were n't any because he'd only had a smacked bum . '
Harry Frearson 's mother yesterday described the boy 's arrest as ' outrageous ' .
Kate Frearson said of her ex-husband : ' Mark would never hurt Harry .
' He is a really good father and sees his son whenever he can .
' Harry dotes on his dad and Mark dotes on him .
I told police there was no chance Mark would ever harm him .
' Poor Harry was white as a sheet when the police turned up with him - absolutely terrified .
He could n't understand why they had taken him away from his dad . '
Following the search , two other officers arrived at his three - bedroom semi-detached house with a female civilian - believed to be a child protection officer .
Harry was examined and then taken to his mother 's home while his father arrested and taken to Charles Cross police station where he spent the night before being released without charge at 10 am .
He said : ' After an hour in a cold cell I was told I would be staying the night as the ' witness ' was not fit to make a statement that night .
' After a cold and miserable night I was interviewed at 10 am .
' The first words said to me were , " the witness has changed his statement " .
The witness had originally alleged I was kicking my son to the floor .
' My ex-wife told them the same night that the allegation was ridiculous but they proceeded regardless with their over - the - top reaction . '
Mr Frearson has now made a formal complaint to the Independent Police Complaints Commission .
He said : ' I want to know why the witness is n't being arrested for wasting police time - and mine .
Where is my apology ?
I have not received one . '
It is understood the police were initially told a child had been kicked , thrown to the ground and bundled into a car .
A police source said officers often delay any interviews after arrests made in ' unsociable hours ' .
A Devon and Cornwall Police spokesman said that because a formal complaint had been made they could not comment on the incident .
A spokesman for The Parent Organization , a pressure group which aims to ' champion the rights of parents ' , said : ' This is a classic case of police over - reacting to one complaint from some do - gooder who interfered without knowing the full picture .
' This level of over - reaction could have traumatised the child and left a father who cares for his son criminalised for behaving as any reasonable parent might have behaved . '
Until four years ago , parents had full rights to use corporal punishment under laws allowing ' reasonable chastisement ' .
Since the 2004 Children
Act it has only been legal to smack if there is no injury , which can be as slight as a bruise or ' psychological harm ' .
Last month the government was forced to quash a rebellion from backbenchers who
wanted to give youngsters the same protection against assault as adults .
The amendment , led by Labour 's Kevin Barron , called for ' the common law rules permitting the use of force for the purpose of punishing a child ' to be abolished .
MPs also voted on the issue in 2004 , when 47 Labour members rebelled and voted unsuccessfully for a ban .

Prominent 9/11 survivor Willie Rodriguez went on Sky News in the UK on Oct. 21 to call attention to the fact that Americans have been faced with ‘ seven years of fear ’ since 9/11 , and only the economic crisis has forced politicians to switch gears from fear mongering for the ‘ War on Terror ’ to other matters .
Rodriguez criticized the 9/11 grandstanding that convinced the public to initially support the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
He also relayed his experiences on the day of the attacks , pointing out that he witnessed multiple explosions in the basement .
The anchor seems rather unfazed by news of explosions in the basement ; perhaps she thought he was referring to the plane hitting the top of the towers .

Today 's
Web search engines are driven primarily by searching for text keywords .
This works fairly well when what you are searching for is words ; but it fails pretty miserably when you are searching for video .
Video search is almost entirely dependent on someone taking the time to manually ( and accurately ) add text tags to videos to make them searchable .
This is all about to change , however , if VideoSurf 's claims are true :
The company says it has developed a way to visually search videos for it content : " VideoSurf is a computer vision search engine that has created a new way for users to easily find , discover and watch the videos from across the Web .
Founded in 2006 by leading experts in computer vision and fast computation , VideoSurf has taught computers to ' see ' inside videos so that videos can now be analyzed and understood .
By offering a search and discovery experience powered by visual content , rather than text , VideoSurf 's search engine delivers more relevant results and provides better ways for users to discover videos online .
VideoSurf also allows consumers to visually navigate results to easily find the specific scenes , people or moments they most want to see , so users spend less time searching and more time being entertained .
VideoSurf aims to become the ultimate destination for consumers looking to search and discover video content on the Web . " VideoSurf was one of 50 recent start - up companies to demo its products at the TechCrunch50 conference in San Francisco this week .
According the Los Angeles Times , VideoSurf appears to have made a positive impression on those who have seen it in action .
Unfortunately , the list of those who have seen it working is still small .
The site is still in private beta and the L.A .
Times reports that company has not even made the site available to reporters yet .
The Times says that Allen Weiner , an analyst for Gartner , did get to see VideoSurf strut its stuff , and Weiner says that it is " extremely promising ...
If applied properly , it could yield extremely thorough and accurate information ...
I think it has the promise to be among the upper echelons in this space . "
The Times further reports that " analysts are predicting it could become an acquisition target for one of the large Internet players .
" VideoSurf claims that its search engine can actually analyze every frame of a video , understand its content , and perform face recognition to identify individuals and even characters in the video .
In the demo at TechCrunch50 ( see the video to the left ) , VideoSurf CEO , Lior Delgo , demonstrated how he could find a specific clip from the TV show , Entourage , just by searching for a specific scene .
When he found what he was looking for , he was able to view the clip with playback starting just before the scene he searched for , and he was n't force to watch the entire clip from the very beginning of the video .
The L.A. Times adds : " VideoSurf says it already has already indexed an impressive collection of videos , giving users access to content across the Web including YouTube , Hulu and major television networks such as Comedy Central and ESPN .
One of the key challenges facing VideoSurf will be to strike partnership deals to make available as much premium content as possible , analysts say .
"
If this technology works as advertised , it could represent a revolution in how video is consumed online .
As the searches take place on the VideoSurf site , the company should have the opportunity to generate sizable ad revenue once the site goes public .

The twins were born at University College Hospital , London
A woman has given birth to conjoined twins by Caesarean section .
Laura Williams , 18 , from Shrewsbury , Shropshire , gave birth to the girls , named Faith and Hope , at University College Hospital , London .
They are believed to be joined from their breastbone to their navel but have separate hearts .
A family spokesman said things were looking " fairly positive " for the girls , who have since been moved to London 's Great Ormond Street Hospital .
Conjoined twins are rare and figures range from one in about every 200,000 births to one in about 400,000 live births .
Abortion advice
Mrs Williams and her husband Aled , from Anglesey , were advised by doctors to have their daughters aborted .
But she told the Mail on Sunday they had never considered it .
Her neighbour Tracey Parker , who has known the family for about four years , said : " I think fair play to her - she 's giving the babies a chance .
" Laura was in bits to start off with but she 's a good mum .
She 's got an older daughter and she 's a good mum to her so I think she 'll be good to these .
" I 'm really pleased for her - I hope everything else goes alright . "
Masha and Dasha Krivoshlyapova , from Russia , were the oldest known surviving conjoined twins .
They died in April 2003 aged 53 .
A team of surgeons in Birmingham carried out a successful operation in 2001 to separate Eman and Sanchia Mowatt , who were joined at the spine .
Earlier this week , I had heard rumblings that American would be back on Kayak , and now it appears to have happened .
The two have apparently resolved their differences , and that can only be good for Kayak users .
I reached out to Kayak spokesperson Kellie Pelletier and she had the following to say :
Kayak.com is delighted to once again display schedules and fares directly from American Airlines on both Kayak.com and SideStep.com .
Users can now compare AA itineraries alongside those from hundreds of leading airlines .
Kayak.com remains committed to providing comprehensive and objective results to our millions of users .
They ’ll be spreading the word to AAdvantage members and Kayak users later today by tomorrow at the latest .
Naturally , the most important question was . . . how will the results be displayed ?
Sadly , I ’m not getting an answer to that one :
AA and Kayak.com have resolved their dispute and have entered into a new agreement .
I am unable to discuss the terms of this agreement .
Of course , it only takes a quick search to see that neither Orbitz nor CheapTickets are anywhere to be found on AA results .
So , it would appear that American won the battle to have their flights only shown from AA.com .
Is it as good as it used to be for Kayak users ?
Nope .
It ’s always better to have results from multiple sites .
But Kayak really needed to have AA results to make their comparisons worthwhile .
If all they can do is get AA.com , it ’s better than nothing .
Although many cultures have long recognized solitude as an opportunity to look inward , in our culture we sometimes think that spending time alone is unhealthy .
Some psychologists even argue that since we ’re social beings , meaning is found only through relationship with other people .
But we are more profoundly relational than that .
To be fully human we need relationships with other people , with the nonhuman world , and with our own inner depths .
In solitude we have the opportunity to explore all these domains of relationship .
We are also spiritual beings and may feel called into solitude to seek communion with a numinous Presence we can directly experience , but not clearly define .
Solitude offers an opportunity to explore the sense of alienation many of us live with and to realize that being alone is not the same as feeling isolated or lonely .
I ’ve been exploring solitude – sometimes during months alone in the wilderness – for forty years , and I ’ve learned that the core of my loneliness is not separation from other people , but feeling disconnected from myself .
Solitude provides a respite from the demands of social life and creates a space for personal healing .
Paradoxically , spending time alone can soften our sense of alienation from others .
Spending time in wilderness solitude is a fascinating adventure .
We have carried specialization to such an extreme in the service of efficient productivity that daily life can seem boringly repetitious .
Activities we used to enjoy when young are lost to the demands of adulthood .
Living alone in the wilderness requires that we learn to do everything required for survival .
The satisfaction of such self - reliance is deeply rewarding .
Not everyone agrees , and there has been a long and sometimes acrimonious argument about the value of solitude .
Perhaps the most common objection is that withdrawing from social engagement is self - indulgent and irresponsible .
But to say a solitary is shirking responsibility is to claim complete understanding of the world .
We can never really know what contribution we ’re making ; we can only be true to our deepest calling and trust that we ’re doing what we ’re meant to do .
I ’ve found that my desire to contribute to the lives of others deepens in solitude .
We each have a social identity , a persona held in place by our interactions with other people .
In solitude this persona begins to lose solidity and dissolve .
The process is sometimes terrifying and there are few easy escapes .
Solitude challenges us to face our inner darkness and to discover that we ’re not identical to the conception we often have of ourselves .
For me , deep wilderness solitude is profoundly meaningful , but I do n’t actually recommend it to others .
It can be painful and dangerous .
We must be called to it from within , and if we require external encouragement , we ’re not yet ready .
But I do think many of us can benefit from stepping out of our hectic daily activities to spend time alone .
Often when asked how we are , we reply , “ Busy . ”
This seems to refer to an on - going state of stress as well as to constant physical and mental activity .
We live with the sense that we do n’t have enough time to do what we believe we must do .
We tend to value activity above everything else , but all beings need to rest and recuperate .
The widespread occurrence of depression in our culture may be linked to our refusal to allow ourselves quiet time .
Feeling the need to be constantly busy can prevent us from turning inward .
When we are out of balance , our activity does n’t arise from a place of stillness and wisdom .
Much of our activity is ecologically destructive , and frequently our efforts to fix the problems we have caused only deepen the wounds .
If , though , we can relax our demands for material goods , the Earth might be able to heal herself .
Perhaps we can find fulfillment in nonmaterial terms and learn that what we seek we already have .
We are sometimes so focused on progress that we do n’t experience our lives as they are here and now .
Yet the world will always be exactly as it is in each moment – no matter how much time and energy we expend denying this simple fact .
If our plans for the future are not grounded in joy in this moment , our lives go unlived .
We frequently do n’t perceive ourselves to be biological beings in a living world .
Theoretically , we know we depend on the physical systems of Earth , but experientially we are alienated from those systems .
We treat the Earth as a stranger we should protect for pragmatic or ethical reasons , but until we begin to actually experience nonhuman creatures as family and the Earth as our home , we are unlikely to make the changes necessary for our survival .
Solitude has the power to catalyze shifts in perception .
The felt experience of belonging to the ecosphere is psychologically and spiritually healing and may have profound implications for changing our patterns of behavior .
Along with economic and legislative solutions , we need inner transformation .
Solitude evokes the spacious wonder of living in a sacred world .

LITHONIA , Ga. 
Just a few blocks off Max Cleland Boulevard , named for the Democrat defeated by Senator Saxby Chambliss in a bitter Congressional race six years ago , a line has formed that could be problematic for Mr. Chambliss ’s own re-election this year .
Hundreds of voters , most of them black residents of bedroom communities east of Atlanta , are waiting to cast early ballots , motivated by the candidacy of Senator Barack Obama but many also taking the opportunity to vote for Jim Martin , Mr. Chambliss ’s Democratic opponent .
“ I voted for Jim because I like what he is saying , not just because he is Democratic , ” Iris Epps said as she exited Lithonia Middle School after waiting about 90 minutes on Tuesday evening to cast her ballot .
She said the wait would have been even longer earlier in the day .
Like several other Senate and House candidates in North Carolina , Ohio and Connecticut , Mr. Chambliss finds himself in a tight race even though only months ago he was considered a cinch for re-election .
A significant part of his problem is the surging participation by African - American voters , their ranks bolstered by the newly registered , a group expected to vote overwhelmingly for Democrats this year .
Bite - Sized Bliss November 20 , 2008
I ’ve been intrigued by almond butter for a while and within about five seconds of screwing off the lid of the jar I bought for this recipe , I was half - a- spoonful in and ready for more .
That stuff is absolutely delicious .
Where have I been ?
It ’s grown - up peanut butter , basically , but I think you ’d be hard - pressed to find a kid who would turn the stuff away .
And it ’s addictive , too , so I ’m glad I had a recipe to fold almost the whole jar right into .
I am fully aware of the holiday - induced caloric uptick in my near future ; no need for a head start by way of almond butter straight from the jar .
Just like almond butter is a more grown - up take on peanut butter , these bars are very similar to — but a bit more sophisticated than — the peanut butter - chocolate chunk blondies that I completely love and previously thought could never be rivaled .
But swap out the peanuts ( in both nut butter and chopped form ) for almonds , and these new bars give the peanut butter blondies a run for their money .
The almond version is sweet and rich and dense and chewy , with a slightly salty edge .
In short , bite - sized bliss .
While I ’ll never truly forsake the peanut butter blondies , these bars also have the advantage of being easier to make .
Just whir the almond butter , sugar , butter and egg right in the food processor .
Fold in the chocolate and chopped almonds , press into a pan and bake .
That ’s it .
As we head into the ( holi ) days of elaborate food ( particularly in the dessert category ) , this recipe will be a welcome quick go - to .

The United States ' leading intelligence organisation has warned that the world is entering an increasingly unstable and unpredictable period in which the advance of western - style democracy is no longer assured , and some states are in danger of being " taken over and run by criminal networks " .
The global trends review , produced by the National Intelligence Council ( NIC ) every four years , represents sobering reading in Barack Obama 's intray as he prepares to take office in January .
The country he inherits , the report warns , will no longer be able to " call the shots " alone , as its power over an increasingly multipolar world begins to wane .
Looking ahead to 2025 , the NIC ( which coordinates analysis from all the US intelligence agencies ) , foresees a fragmented world , where conflict over scarce resources is on the rise , poorly contained by " ramshackle " international institutions , while nuclear proliferation , particularly in the Middle East , and even nuclear conflict grow more likely .
" Global Trends 2025 : A World Transformed " warns that the spread of western democratic capitalism cannot be taken for granted , as it was by George Bush and America 's neoconservatives .
" No single outcome seems preordained : the Western model of economic liberalism , democracy and secularism , for example , which many assumed to be inevitable , may lose its lustre – at least in the medium term , " the report warns .
It adds : " Today wealth is moving not just from West to East but is concentrating more under state control , " giving the examples of China and Russia .
" In the wake of the 2008 global financial crisis , the state 's role in the economy may be gaining more appeal throughout the world . "
At the same time , the US will become " less dominant " in the world – no longer the unrivalled superpower it has been since the end of the Cold War , but a " first among equals " in a more fluid and evenly balanced world , making the unilateralism of the Bush era no longer tenable .
The report predicts that over the next two decades " the multiplicity of influential actors and distrust of vast power means less room for the US to call the shots without the support of strong partnerships . "
It is a conclusion that meshes with president elect Obama 's stated preference for multilateralism , but the NIC findings suggest that as the years go by it could be harder for Washington to put together " coalitions of the willing " to pursue its agenda .
International organisations , like the UN , seem ill - prepared to fill the vacuum left by receding American power , at a time of multiple potential crises driven by climate change the increasing scarcity of resources like oil , food and water .
Those institutions " appear incapable of rising to the challenges without concerted efforts from their leaders " it says .
In an unusually graphic illustration of a possible future , the report presents an imaginary " presidential diary entry " from October 1 , 2020 , that recounts a devastating hurricane , fuelled by global warming , hitting New York in the middle of the UN 's annual general assembly .
" I guess we had it coming , but it was a rude shock , " the unnamed president writes .
" Some of the scenes were like the stuff from the World War II newsreels , only this time it was not Europe but Manhattan .
Those images of the US aircraft carriers and transport ships evacuating thousands in the wake of the flooding still stick in my mind . "
As he flies off for an improvised UN reception on board an aircraft carrier , the imaginary future president admits : " The cumulation of disasters , permafrost melting , lower agricultural yields , growing health problems , and the like are taking a terrible toll , much greater than we anticipated 20 years ago . "
The last time the NIC published its quadrennial glimpse into the future was December 2004 .
President Bush had just been re-elected and was preparing his triumphal second inauguration that was to mark the high - water mark for neoconservatism .
That report matched the mood of the times .
It was called Mapping the Global Future , and looked forward as far as 2020 when it projected " continued US dominance , positing that most major powers have forsaken the idea of balancing the US " .
That confidence is entirely lacking from this far more sober assessment .
Also gone is the belief that oil and gas supplies " in the ground " were " sufficient to meet global demand " .
The new report views a transition to cleaner fuels as inevitable .
It is just the speed that is in question .
The NIC believes it is most likely that technology will lag behind the depletion of oil and gas reserves .
A sudden transition , however , will bring problems of its own , creating instability in the Gulf and Russia .
While emerging economies like China , India and Brazil are likely to grow in influence at America 's expense , the same cannot be said of the European Union .
The NIC appears relatively certain the EU will be " losing clout " by 2025 .
Internal bickering and a " democracy gap " separating Brussels from European voters will leave the EU " a hobbled giant " , unable to translate its economic clout into global influence .
Disaster diary
An imaginary diary entry written by a future US president , produced to illustrate a climate - change disaster :
Those images of US aircraft carriers evacuating thousands in the wake of flooding stick in my mind .
Why must the hurricane season coincide with the UN general assembly in New York ?
It 's bad enough that this had to happen ; it was doubly embarrassing that half the world 's leaders were here to witness it .
I guess the problem is we had counted on this not happening , at least not yet .

Editor 's note : Maury Klein is professor emeritus of history at the University of Rhode Island .
He is the author of 15 books , including " Rainbow 's End : The Crash of 1929 " and most recently " The Power Makers : Steam , Electricity , and the Men Who Made Modern America . "
Historian Maury Klein says it 's important to remember that psychology plays a huge role in financial markets .
( CNN ) -- Friday marks the 79th anniversary of the day that launched the stock market crash of 1929 .
As an unprecedented wave of selling threw the floor of the New York Stock Exchange into pandemonium on a day that became known as Black Thursday , a show of organized support by a coterie of leading bankers halted the panic .
But on the following Monday , the market collapsed in a tsunami of selling .
Every intense convulsion of the stock market raises primal fears spawned by the Great Crash of 1929 and the ensuing Great Depression , which dragged on for a full decade and has haunted Americans ever since .
The Panic of 2008 is no exception .
In the past year , the market 's fall has at times rivaled that of 1929 .
Are there connections or similarities between those earlier national traumas and our current crisis ?
First some facts about that earlier experience .
The Great Crash and the Great Depression were two separate events .
The Crash was a financial panic , the Depression an economic downturn .
The one does not necessarily lead to the other ; the market has collapsed several times in American history without bringing on a depression .
Great Depression holds lessons for surviving a tough economy
The Crash began in October 1929 , and the worst of it was over in three weeks ; the Depression did not fasten itself on the nation for another year .
To this day , the connection between them remains unclear , which makes it difficult to draw lessons or analogies from them .
The Dow plunged 39 percent between October 23 and November 13 , 1929 , but it regained 74 percent of that loss by March 1930 .
Only when the economy failed to gain momentum in the spring did the market slip back .
By fall the country had slipped into a depression , and the market resumed a downward course that did not touch bottom until July 1932 .
It did not again return to the levels of 1929 until 1954 .
The Depression did not end until increased military spending revived the economy in the spring of 1940 .
The bull market of the 1920s was unique in that it marked the first time large numbers of ordinary people participated .
The market moved from Wall Street to Main Street and aroused intense interest even among people who were not active in it .
The new investors , or " fish " as the pros called them , were prone to panic when the market fell sharply .
Could it happen again ?
History never repeats itself , but historical patterns do -- though always in a new context .
Here are just a few of the similarities and differences between the earlier crisis and its modern version .
During the 1920s , the financial industry underwent a great expansion , bringing into the business many inexperienced people and new investment vehicles -- most notably the investment trust , the forerunner of the modern mutual fund .
Nobody knew what impact they would have on the market with their buying and selling on a large scale .
The business world hailed the 1920s as the " New Era , " one with new rules in which the old pattern of cyclical depressions would no longer occur and prosperity would be continuous .
Compare this delusion with the " New Economy " of the 1990s .
The 1920s marked the beginning of the consumer economy , and with it a broad expansion of credit .
Installment buying made its debut on a large scale .
Credit also was used to buy stocks on margin , greatly increasing the market 's volume and volatility .
The banking system was shaky throughout the 1920s , and failures escalated steadily after 1929 .
The Crash exposed many cases of fraud that led to investigations and passage of the most significant banking reform in American history .
The Glass - Steagall Act of 1933 created the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp. , or FDIC , gave rise to the Securities and Exchange Commission , or SEC , and separated investment banks from commercial banks .
The latter reform was repealed in 1999 , giving banks free rein to perform both activities once again .
Some differences between the eras are worth noting .
Prior to 1933 , the federal government played virtually no active role in relieving the banking crisis of the 1920s .
The stock market did not have giant institutional buyers moving huge blocks of stock .
Nor did it operate on a global scale , though it was deeply influenced by international events .
After the crash , the banks had plenty of money to lend but no takers , the opposite of today 's situation .
Deflation became the mortal enemy as people removed their cash from banks and hoarded it .
A familiar pattern emerged from these events .
Business and the Republican Party in the 1920s demanded and got a " free " market unrestrained by government .
Neither Wall Street nor the New York Stock Exchange was regulated by the government .
The resulting disaster prompted outraged demands that Washington " do something . "
Regulation was then forthcoming .
Later , as prosperity returned and the market began soaring , the restraints were gradually removed and the pattern of excess began anew until it collapsed once again in our own time .
With the fall comes renewed pleas for government to " do something . "
Finally , it is important to remember that psychology plays a huge role in financial markets .
Every panic has been at bottom a crisis of confidence .
So too with the economy .
As Frederick Lewis Allen observed , " Prosperity is more than an economic condition ; it is a state of mind . "
The trick is always to find out what exactly is needed to restore it .
We are still fishing for the answer to that riddle .

Police state Britain : MPs want protection after arrest of Tory for telling truths Labour did n't want you to know
MPs demanded protection from a ' police state ' last night after the heavy - handed arrest of a Tory frontbencher shocked Westminster .
Extraordinary details of four simultaneous raids on immigration spokesman Damian Green 's homes and offices raised urgent questions about the independence of Parliament .
The Oxford - educated father of two girls , who denies any wrongdoing , was fingerprinted and required to give a DNA sample before being released on bail after nine hours .
A police officer removes items from Damian Green 's constituency office in Bethersden , Kent , after his arrest
Police seized his mobile phone , his BlackBerry , bank statements , computers containing confidential details of constituents , and were only prevented from carrying off legal documents by his wife , a barrister .
Officers even leafed through the couple 's love letters .
The tactics of Scotland Yard investigating a series of leaks that had no bearing on national security and served only to embarrass Labour were compared to those used in Robert Mugabe 's Zimbabwe .
Last night , the row between police and Parliament was turning into a political crisis for Gordon Brown , who faced accusations of standing by while the rights of MPs were being trampled .
Ministers struggled to dispel suspicions that they knew in advance about the plan to arrest Mr Green , amid MPs ' fears that the case marked another step towards the politicisation of the police .
Damian Green leaves his home in Ealing , West London , having received bail after nine hours in police custody
The Tories issued a series of questions about the role of Home Secretary Jacqui Smith .
Shadow Home Secretary Dominic
Grieve said there were huge question marks over the claim that Mr Brown and Miss Smith had not been informed the arrest was about to take place .
He said : ' It would be an astounding breakdown in the system of governance , and the linchpin doctrine of Ministerial responsibility , if Ministers were not , at the bare minimum , kept informed . '
MPs also demanded assurances from Speaker Michael Martin that he would defend their interests after it emerged that he authorised an unprecedented police search of Mr Green 's office on Commons property .
One called on Mr Martin to quit .
Publicly , the Prime Minister said only that his chief objective was to uphold the independence of the police .
But his supporters accused the Tories of ' playing politics ' with a routine police matter , and even suggested the Yard had undisclosed reasons to seize Mr Green .
Thursday 's raids , involving some 20 officers , were carried out on Mr Green 's homes in west London and Kent , and his Commons and constituency offices .
The MP was detained in Kent on suspicion of ' conspiracy to commit misconduct in a public office ' and taken to London by Yard detectives ten days after a Home Office official was arrested on suspicion of leaking sensitive documents .
Green 's wife , Alicia Collinson , at their home after her husband 's arrest
Police are investigating Mr Green 's role in four leaks to the media over the past year - two of them to the Mail - that embarrassed the Home Office .
The operation was authorised by Met Assistant Commissioner Bob Quick , Britain 's most senior counter - terrorism officer .
The Crown Prosecution Service was also consulted .
Sources said Mr Green is suspected of actively seeking leaked information , not just receiving it .
Met Deputy Commissioner Sir Paul Stephenson , who has effectively been running the Met since Sir Ian Blair announced his resignation two months ago , was briefed by Mr Quick in advance .
Sir Ian , who officially stepped down yesterday , was not aware of the operation .
In the 30 minutes leading up to the raids , Sir Paul rang London Mayor Boris Johnson and Tory leader David Cameron .
He also notified Sir David Normington , the Home Office permanent secretary , who claimed he deliberately did not tell Home Secretary Jacqui Smith until after the arrest .
The news was relayed to Mr Brown about an hour later .
By last night , Mr Green 's ordeal had provoked outrage across the political spectrum , with all parties rallying to his defence .
Tory MPs threatened to disrupt Wednesday 's Queen 's Speech debate .
Veteran former Labour MP Tony Benn said the arrest of an MP amounted to a contempt of Parliament .
' Once the police can interfere with Parliament , we are into the police state , ' he said .
Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg said : ' This is something you might expect from a tin - pot dictatorship , not in a modern democracy . '
Gordon Brown insists ministers were not told in advance of the raids on Green 's home and office , pictured
Tory MPs contrasted the case with that of leaks of sensitive information to BBC business editor Robert Peston .
They raised suspicions that a ' mole ' inside Downing Street or the Treasury had passed Mr Peston a string of market - moving banking ' scoops ' .
Former Tory leader Michael Howard pointed to Mr Brown 's reputation for obtaining Government leaks when he was an Opposition MP .
' If this approach had been in place when Gordon Brown was in opposition , he'd have spent half his time under arrest , ' he said .
Miss Smith denied that ministers had been involved in any way in the arrest of Mr Green .

My valued colleague , Dr. Antonio Baines , recently invited me to speak for his graduate course in Toxicology .
Dr. Baines ’ course is one of the most highly - regarded graduate classes at North Carolina Central University for M.S. students in Biology and Pharmaceutical Sciences .
Antonio asked that I discuss the pharmacology and toxicology of herbal and non-botanical dietary supplements but pretty much gave me free reign as to the mechanism by which I would do so .
In the past , I have often introduced herbal supplements to students who already know a bit about drug and toxicant action by taking the example of the anticancer drug , taxol ( Note : Little “ t ” taxol was the name originally given to this chemical by its co-discovers but the corporate sponsor used it as a registered trademark for the brand name , big “ t ” Taxol , and the USAN proposed the use of the cumbersome paclitaxel as the generic name . ) .
As I noted in my previous post , taxol is an anticancer drug isolated from the bark of the Pacific yew tree , Taxus brevifolia , and was the first compound shown to kill cancer cells by promoting microtubule polymerization ( and preventing depolymerization ) .
As a teaching tool in demonstrating how far we ’ve come since Sertürner first isolated codeine and morphine from the opium poppy , I ask students to answer a rather simple , seemingly flippant , but highly informative question :
If taxol is an anticancer drug with known clinical activity against ovarian , lung , and breast cancer , why do n’t we prescribe Taxus bark for cancer ?
Similarly , why does n’t the dietary supplement industry promote ground Taxus bark as an oral dosage form , herbal remedy to promote well - being for cancer patients ?
These questions get to the heart of why we have come over 200 years from Sertürner ’s day : to purify and concentrate pharmacologically - active constituents from natural products :
1. Drug metabolism and lack of oral bioavailability : Orally adminstered drugs are subject to first - pass metabolism when absorbed in the gut .
The mesenteric blood supply collects into the hepatic portal vein and must get through the liver before being distributed to the rest of the body .
The primary Phase I drug oxidizing enzymes and Phase II drug conjugating enzymes are in their highest concentrations in the liver and many compounds are metabolized to inactive compounds before they even reach the systemic circulation .
( N.B. , The intestinal mucosa also contains some cytochrome P450 isozymes , so metabolism starts even earlier than that . )
As a result , many drugs , like taxol , must be given intravenously to preclude first - pass metabolism .
2. Influence of bark composition : Lignans and cellulosic compounds might interfere with the absorption of taxol by preventing its dissolution .
In fact , any change in the amount or composition of inactive excipients in a prescription drug can dramatically influence dissolution and drug absorption .
Other components of the bark might as as competitive inhibitors of taxol ’s binding to tubulin or , in a broader sense , have some other adverse influence on drug pharmacodynamics .
In addition , other components of the bark might enhance the metabolism of taxol .
This leads us into :
3 . What is the appropriate dose of bark ? :
This is a major stumbling point with herbal medicines .
Indeed , botanical products may contain physiologically - active compounds , but these may be at concentrations too low to achieve relevant plasma concentrations .
Taxus bark contains 0.05 to 0.005 % taxol .
Even if taxol were orally - active , the amount of bark one would have to ingest would be so large as to present a patient compliance issue ( or at least severe gastrointestinal discomfort ) .
4. Reproducibility : If a tumor response was observed , how would one know how much bark to give the patient for the next dose ?
The environment ( weather , soil composition , water , sun ) in which the trees are grown can all influence the abundance of secondary metabolites present in crude plant material .
Hence , there are significant lot - to - lot variations in the chemical composition of botanical products .
Even if all of the above issues were circumvented , the reproducibility of subsequent doses might have unpredictable biological effects .
5. Toxicological issues : Again related to growth environment , many plants are bioaccumulators of heavy metals from the soil , especially cadmium .
With many recent reports of heavy metal contamination of herbal remedies , companies are only now beginning to test their raw materials for heavy metals .
Plant materials could also be contaminated with pesticides , insecticides , or harmful microorganisms that would also be removed if the active principle were purified .
Moreover , there have been several cases of botanical products intentionally or accidentally adulterated with other prescription drugs ( called ‘ undeclared drugs ’ by the US FDA ) in the attempt to produce a biological effect that the plant medicine is incapable of having itself .
There are certainly more issues that readers are welcome to add in the comments .
The point of this exercise was to demonstrate to students the distinctions between the safety and efficacy of crude plant products relative to pure drugs isolated from such natural sources .
This discussion and list was compiled in a fraction of the time it took me to type it .

" Scandal is our growth industry .
Scandal , unpurged and unresolved , transcends political reality to become commercial fact .
1. Revelation :
2. Investigation :
3. Expiation :
relies on images of power , the press
the gatekeepers of our ignorance
Information is all .
people 's natural sense of the good
society 's inevitable cleansing .
Scandal offers an endless stream of what the business is after all supposed to be about : news .
As in : what is new .
" breaking news , "
Everything changes and nothing does .
" the people , "
" Now you have shown independence , commendable independence , "
" on some key issues — torture , for example . "
metamorphosed
" key issue . "
Something we can live with .
: a source of bottomless self - justification .
" war president . "
special mental atmosphere that a hierarchical society needs .
" smoking gun . "
Revelation of wrongdoing leads not to definitive investigation , punishment , and expiation but to more scandal .
Permanent scandal .
Frozen scandal .
The weapons of mass destruction that turned out not to exist .
The torture of detainees who remain forever detained .
The firing of prosecutors which is forever investigated .
These and other frozen scandals metastasize , ramify , self - replicate , clogging the cable news shows and the blogosphere and the bookstores .
The titillating story that never ends , the pundit gabfest that never ceases , the gift that never stops giving : what is indestructible , irresolvable , unexpiatable is too valuable not to be made into a source of profit .
We remember , many of us , a different time .
However cynically we look to our political past , it is there that we find our political Eden : Vietnam and its domestic denouement , Watergate — the climax of a different time of scandal that ended a war and brought down a president .
In retrospect those events unfold with the clear logic of utopian dream .
intrepid journalists exposing the gaudy , interlocking crimes of the Nixon administration .
not just by the press — for that was but precursor , the necessary condition — but by Congress and the courts .
Investigation , that is , by the polity , working through its institutions to construct a story of grim truth that citizens can in common accept .
the handing down of sentences , the politicians in shackles led off to jail , the orgy of public repentance .
The exorcism of shame , the purging of the political system , and the return to a state , however imperfect , of societal grace .
It is a myth , of course , but a lovely one .
It , and the people that fit our collective longing — for justice , for heroism , and for ultimate goodness residing in a people who , once alerted to wrongdoing , insist on its rectification .
The obstacle to this natural self - cleansing of our political life can only be the people 's ignorance .
For if they know , and the corruption and scandals persist — well , how can the people be good ?
No , what must be missing then — so the myth implies — is clarity , revelation .
What is missing iswhose duty it is to draw the curtain back from scandal and show the people everything , thereby starting the polity on the road to inexorable justice .
Information , together with theand the right , leads to expiation and Scandals , the more complicated and richer the plotlines the better , have above all to endure .
Scandals provide the fodder for on - air confrontation , the verbal slash and parry — which is what television , a terrible medium for conveying information of any complexity , does best , and does most cheaply .
Scandals provide subplots and minor characters and spin - offs .
They offer , to the post - Watergate , high - profile , well - coiffed , colleague - of - the - powerful journalist hero of today — could anything be further from the deeply irreverent working stiff cracking wise in Howard Hawks 's " His Girl Friday " - the true venue for the highest practice of his art , the television studio .
That art relies on , or anyway thrives on , scandal .
Scandal denotes success .
Scandal shows he is doing his job .
Scandal means pay dirt .
And scandal represents that media - age dream , the perpetual story .
Scandal can be rehashed , debated , photographed , from initial leak , to perp walk , to hearing , to trial , to appeal .
Scandal brings the heart - pumping , breath - gulping surge of stop - the - presses excitement , letting us know that into our fallen world the Gods of Great Events have finally come down from on high to intervene .
Scandal represents movement , the audible cracking of the ice .
And yet it is all an illusion , for beneath the rapidly moving train of gaudily hypedbeneath all the grave and breathless stand - ups before the inevitable pillars of public buildings , beneath the swirling , gyrating phantasmagoria of scandal lies a kind of dystopian stasis .
It is not information , it is politics .
If we have learned anything this past decade it is thatthat vaunted repository of public good — " the people always find out " — the people are willing and able to live with quite a lot .
They read , watch television , grunt a pox on all their houses , and turn back to their dinners .
Thanks to the efficiency of our age of scandal we now know as never before what the public is willing to live with .
Barack Obama said to John McCain in the third debate , Torture has , these past few years , from an execrable war crime to a From something forbidden by international treaty and condemned by domestic law to ... something to be debated .
Something one can stand on either side of .
What notes on scandal could be complete without mention of the presiding master - scandal of our age , The War .
One uses capitals to denote not a set of discrete events — a set of particular people being cut down or blown apart by particular violent actions at particular times — but a state of mind .
Threat becomes not only a political shield but what is in the end much more dangerousWhat is dangerous is not only that our leaders have endlessly maintained that they are right but that they believe they are .
George Bush , as he declared to the world in a proudly emphatic phrase , had been reborn as aGeorge Orwell has long since surveyed this ground , most famously in 1984 , in his perpetual war between Eastasia , Eurasia , and Oceania , a never - ending , shape - shifting struggle that , if we judge it by the standards of previous wars , is merely an imposture .
It is like the battles between certain ruminant animals whose horns are set at such an angle that they are incapable of hurting one another .
But though it is unreal it is not meaningless ....
It helps to preserve theHow will history choose to explain a war launched in the cause of ridding the world of weapons of mass destruction that turned out not to exist ?
It is a tantalizing question .
Will the Iraq
War take its place as a historical curiosity , alongside the Guano War of the nineteenth century or the Soccer War of the twentieth ?
And how interested will our descendants be in the response of our democratic polity : the investigations that , like dinosaurs slowly rousing themselves from the mudhole , ever so slowly got under way and then , after years of lumbering effort — hundreds of hours of testimony , thousands of documents examined — finally discovered ... What ...?

What is MOTHER 3 ?
An awesome RPG .
This video ( which , like any good trailer , contains some spoilers ! ) says it all :
The Backstory
Mother 3 is the sequel to EarthBound ( an epic Super Nintendo RPG released in 1995 ) which was in development for 12 years before it was released in Japan in April 2006 .
It soon became clear that Nintendo of America was uninterested in localizing the game , so in November 2006 the fans took matters into their own hands with the Do it Yourself Devotion project .
For two years a team of translators and hackers worked to produce an in - depth , professional translation and localization of MOTHER 3 .
In August 2007 the team began blogging about their progress , attracting the attention of the gaming industry , media , and more than half a million unique visitors .
On October 17 , 2008 , version 1.0 of the fan translation was released .
It was downloaded well over 100,000 times in the months which followed .
On July 19 , 2009 , version 1.1 was released , containing typo / grammar corrections and a series of bug fixes .
Good times .
The Republican party showed signs of disarray today over the prospect of a Barack Obama presidential victory being matched by sweeping gains on November 4 by the Democrats in Congress on a scale not witnessed since the 1930s .
Figures show the Democrats outspending the Republicans 4 - 1 in congressional races across the country .
Democrats are also being helped by huge turnouts of African - Americans and young voters in states where Obama is unlikely to win but where those in Congressional races stand to benefit .
Among indications of panic today , the National Republican Congressional Committee pulled $ 50,000 ( £ 31,000 ) in ads scheduled for broadcast from Monday for Michele Bachmann , a Republican congresswoman from Minnesota .
The party effectively disowned her over remarks she made on television on Friday in which she said Obama " may have anti-American views " .
The committee is also withdrawing funding from other congressional races seen as futile contests .
If Obama won the White House and the Democrats gained more seats in the House and Senate - and even reached the magic 60 seats in the Senate that would allow the Democrats to override any Republican attempts to filibuster legislation - he would potentially be in one of the strongest positions enjoyed by any Democratic president since Roosevelt in 1932 .
Tom Mann , a political analyst at the Brookings Institution , said today the Democrats could gain seven to 10 Senate seats and 20 to 30 in the House .
With polls showing Obama extending his lead in key states , John McCain fought today on a " Joe the plumber " platform , saying an Obama presidency would mean tax increases for the working and middle classes .
He also returned to the theme that Obama is too inexperienced to face an international crisis .
Obama , after a rally in Indianapolis , abandoned campaigning temporarily to visit his ailing grandmother , Madelyn Dunham , in Hawaii .
In a CBS interview , Obama said he did not want to repeat the mistake of not being at his mother 's bedside before she died .
He said of his grandmother : " We knew she was n't doing well , but you know , the diagnosis was such that we thought we had a little more time and we did n't . "
The Republican party is facing tight races across the country in congressional seats it would normally regard as safe .
Even Elizabeth Dole , a Republican senator from North Carolina , which has been Republican for 35 years , is on the defensive , with an ad warning voters that the Democrats should not be allowed total control of the White House and Congress .
The Democrats had struggled to find someone to stand against her , given she was regarded as unassailable , but the eventual candidate , Kay Hagan , now enjoys a narrow poll lead .
In Minnesota , Bachmann 's Democratic rival , Elwyn Tinklenberg , had also been regarded as a no -hoper .
But since Bachmann 's remarks about Obama , Tinklenberg has been the beneficiary of a backlash , taking in $ 1.3 m in donations since Friday .
The non-partisan Campaign Finance Institute reported yesterday that the Democratic Congressional Committee has spent $ 37 m since August on behalf of its congressional candidates , compared with the NRCC's $ 9.6 m .
Democrats are expected to make gains in the Senate in southern states such as Mississippi , Kentucky and Georgia , where there are big African - American populations , many of whom are set to turn out for the first time to vote for Obama .

I was watching CNBC today when I heard one of the guest today use the term “ socialize the losses ” when talking about bailing out the auto industry .
Of course we all know that he is right and that ’s what the US government has done with the Financial industry and are now looking towards the auto industry to do the same thing .
But he said it with such a negative connotation that it really caught my eye .
I know free market idealist have really been bashing the bailout and so have people on the other side such as writer Naomi Klein with her new article in Rolling Stone “ The new trough “ .
There is a good amount of people that believe that the bail out was ill conceived as well as not an ideal solution .
I agree with both of those premises but I also believe that it was the right thing to do for the short term , only implemented in the most bone headed way possible .
We have to worry about jobs and not just punishing mishandled corporations .
If we allow GM alone to go under they are predicting as much as 3 million jobs could be loss , from the corporation and it ’s subsidiaries , to the hot dog vendor on the corner .
That would be a disastrous hit on our economy and something that can not be allowed to happen .
This bail out could have gone so much better but so far has proven to be another wayward episode in the life of the Bush administration .
We had a model that has already proven to be a successful way to ease us into the bail out .
All we had to do was look at Britain and their bailing out of Northern Rock and other financial institutions .
They have one thing that was implemented that our federal governors failed to do , and that ’s hold these banks accountable .
The government is now members of the boards of the financial institutions that they helped bail out .
The most important business and mandate of these institutions is to pay back the tax payers , then the investors , and then the CEO ’s of the companies .
In America we have companies that have been bailed out billions of dollars still throwing lavish parties for the only reason , “ that they were planned beforehand ” .
This is ridiculous , our bail out money is buying us no leverage against these institutions .
We should be partial owners and controllers of these financial and automotive giants and if they do n’t like it then we will allow you to fail , it ’s the American way .
These companies need a serious spanking and Henry Paulson is not giving it to them .
Maybe he is to much of a buddy to the financial industry and does n’t want to risk not being invited to anymore social gatherings .
Whatever the case this buddy system that we have been doing with the bail out has to end and has to end now .
With our money comes accountability and if you do n’t like that , good luck with digging your company out a ditch .
JPMorgan Chase stands accused of allegedly precipitating the collapse Lehman Brothers Holdings by freezing Lehman assets days before it filed for bankruptcy protection .
Lehman creditors have accused JPMorgan of freezing $ 17 billion in cash and securities on Friday , Sept. 12 , according to a published report .
Lehman filed for bankruptcy the following Monday .
The news comes as the disgraced head of Lehman , Dick Fuld , tells Congress that banking regulators knew exactly how the company was pricing its distressed assets and about its liquidity in the montsh before its collapse .
For months while Lehman 's fortunes continued to sour , it continued to assure the investing
public it could survive .
Fuld held numerous conversations with JPMorgan CEO Jamie Dimon during this time .
Dimon 's capital markets chief Steve Black met with Fuld days before the firm 's bankruptcy .
Its
unclear what Fuld told these insiders , but it is clear they were increasingly worried about the Lehman 's future .
Rep. Henry Waxman , the Democratic chairman of the U.S. House of Representatives Committee on Oversight and Government Reform , has called Fuld and former chief executives of insurer American International Group to appear at hearings into the financial excesses that led to the collapse of the companies .
Here is a brief timeline of what happened to Lehman Brothers :
Early summer : JPMorgan is the clearing bank on behalf of clients who have exposure to Lehman trade .
These are money market fund and pension funds .
JPMorgan also makes intra day loans to Lehman
July :
The head of JPMorgan 's risk department begins asking for collateral from Lehman as it becomes clear that Lehman 's problems are n't going away and clients are getting nervous
JPMorgan asks for $ 5 billion in July , but does not receive it until August .
And it receives structured securities , which JPMorgan considers difficult to value .
When valued , JPMorgan feels they 're worth significantly less than $ 5 billion .
It is unclear why JPMorgan accepts these securities .
But it should be noted that Lehman has publicly stated at this time that it is looking for capital and that it wants to sell its investment management business .
Early September : Lehman still has not raised capital .
It has approached several banks about possible mergers .
Nothing happens .
It sets a course to sell its investment management division to raise capital .
But the firm 's prospects begin to dim considerably ; counterparties getting anxious ; credit default swaps spiking .
September 4 : Lehman is really teetering .
This time , JPMorgan asks for another $ 5 billion in collateral in cash .
JPMorgan 's internal analysis shows that the initial $ 5 billion tranche deteriorated significantly -- worth around $ 1 billion .
JPMorgan demands the money on behalf of money market fund clients who are demanding collateral on trades with Lehman .
The money does n't come in .
September 9 : Steve Black , head of capital markets , knowing that Lehman has not paid the $ 5 billion from the week before , asks for another $ 5 billion in cash .
He personally reaches out to Lehman CEO Dick Fuld .
Fuld obliges with $ 3 billion .
Black agrees , but JPMorgan is getting increasingly nervous :
It is worried that Lehman will go bankrupt if it does n't raise money .
That same day JPMorgan also finds out Lehman is going to preannounce its losses and plans to raise capital .
JPMorgan and Citigroup both call a meeting with Lehman 's head of capital markets .
Both ask Lehman not to go ahead with the announcement .
It will spook markets unless it raises significant capital -- the sale of the investment management division would not be enough .
Lehman said it was worth $ 8 billion but Street estimates were less than $ 3 billion .
The firm needed around $ 4 billion in capital .
However , nothing happens .
September 10 : Lehman does the pre-announcement and conference call to analysts .
They assure investors the firm is healthy despite all the problems the firm had delivering capital to JPMorgan .
Deutsche Bank analyst Mike Mayo asks the question about the need to raise $ 4 billion in capital .
Lehman 's CFO says it does n't need that much .
September 11 - 12 : JPMorgan discovers that its initial $ 5 billion was n't paid .
It demands $ 8 billion immediately .
Over those two days Lehman delivers the money .
September 12 : CNBC breaks the story that Lehman is selling itself
September 13 / 14 : The Fed tries to save Lehman through a private sector bailout , but this fails
September 15 : Lehman files for bankruptcy
In his testimony , Fuld said the SEC and the Fed conducted regular and at times daily oversight of Lehman 's business and balance sheet , Fuld said .
On Tuesday , the committee will take on former AIG CEOs Robert Willumstad , Martin Sullivan and Maurice " Hank " Greenberg .
More From CNBC.com
Waxman has a reputation for raking high - profile corporate executives over the coals as cameras roll .
Last month , Waxman asked the CEOs to provide internal documents and communications transmitted to and from the executive suites during a 180 - day period leading up to Sept. 16 , the day after Lehman , the 158 - year - old investment bank and Wall Street fixture , filed for bankruptcy .
Last week , lawmakers in Washington finally approved a $ 700 billion rescue package after much political wrangling , while European governments were forced to ride to the rescue of several major European banks .

Instructions & Additional Information
Practice Free with TrainEar.com :
Apparently there 's some kind of misconception from some saying guessing and checking on actual songs is better .
Training interval identification in a coordinated way lets you get this ability infinitely faster .
Associating intervals will be slower than guess and check only in the beginning .
If you want long term improvement ear training is the way to go .
Picking out a song by ear by guessing repeatedly is not the same thing as playing a melody out with little or no mistakes in real - time .
Finally , whistling or singing to replicate a note correctly is not perfect pitch .

I have recently been wanting to learn to play tunes by ear because it has always been said that the ear is important when it comes to music .
I have been using the ear to invent tunes , though .
jimmy made a video saying that his tutorials couldnt compete with the comedy videos on youtube so he compared the view of his tuts to the funniest shit on the internet .... jimmy thinks he should be so popular so ... he quit making videos .. because he didnt compare his videos to other tutorials ... how you make programs like that ?
04:55 xDDha haI am working on my musictheory , and I believe that that is important , but training your ear is just as important and this programm is genious for that .
I just favorited the programm in my browser .
DID HE DIE !?!?!?!?!?!??!?!
Best wishes Jimmy , hope all is well .
:) ear training is important .
If you can't hear the difference all the theory in the world wo n't fix that .... not to bash western civilized music theory that is .
Learning to play by ear helps develop relative pitch and learning the theory helps explain the whys and hows and music composition .
Just my two cents .
this is really retarded .

I have recently been wanting to learn to play tunes by ear because it has always been said that the ear is important when it comes to music .
I have been using the ear to invent tunes , though .
jimmy made a video saying that his tutorials couldnt compete with the comedy videos on youtube so he compared the view of his tuts to the funniest shit on the internet .... jimmy thinks he should be so popular so ... he quit making videos .. because he didnt compare his videos to other tutorials ... how you make programs like that ?
04:55 xDDha haI am working on my musictheory , and I believe that that is important , but training your ear is just as important and this programm is genious for that .
I just favorited the programm in my browser .
DID HE DIE !?!?!?!?!?!??!?!
Best wishes Jimmy , hope all is well .
:) ear training is important .
If you can't hear the difference all the theory in the world wo n't fix that .... not to bash western civilized music theory that is .
Learning to play by ear helps develop relative pitch and learning the theory helps explain the whys and hows and music composition .
Just my two cents .
this is really retarded .

jimmy made a video saying that his tutorials couldnt compete with the comedy videos on youtube so he compared the view of his tuts to the funniest shit on the internet .... jimmy thinks he should be so popular so ... he quit making videos .. because he didnt compare his videos to other tutorials ... how you make programs like that ?
04:55 xDDha haI am working on my musictheory , and I believe that that is important , but training your ear is just as important and this programm is genious for that .
I just favorited the programm in my browser .
DID HE DIE !?!?!?!?!?!??!?!
Best wishes Jimmy , hope all is well .
:) ear training is important .
If you can't hear the difference all the theory in the world wo n't fix that .... not to bash western civilized music theory that is .
Learning to play by ear helps develop relative pitch and learning the theory helps explain the whys and hows and music composition .
Just my two cents .
this is really retarded .
u need to learn music theoryWow the Closed Captions work on this video !

If you 're hear to brag then it 's not impressive at all ..O MY GOD !
Thank you so much !
I finally get what my bass teacher was trying to explain with the minor / major second , minor / major third .
perfect fourth etc. it is surprisingly simple !

Yoni Rabkin put together an elisp file of Common Lisp pitfalls .
It will display one at random when slime starts up .
Here are a few examples :
REMOVE - and DELETE - DUPLICATES keep the _later_ ( in the sequence ) of two matching items .
To keep the earlier items , use : FROM-END T. Remembering that : FROM-END exists may make it easier to remember the default behavior .
READ -FROM-STRING has some optional arguments before the keyword parameters .
If you want to supply some keyword arguments , you have to give all of the optional ones too .
Other functions with this property : WRITE - STRING , WRITE - LINE , PARSE - NAMESTRING .
Some Common lisp operators use EQ , rather than the usual EQL , in a way that cannot be overridden : CATCH , GET , GET - PROPERTIES , GETF , REMF , REMPROP , and THROW .
See table 5 - 11 on p 5 - 57 of the standard .
Many of these seem to be about having correct expectations .
For example , the wording in the standard is pretty clear that you should n't expect a particular initial element in arrays unless you provide one explicitly .
For a long time , I expected number - specialized arrays to be initialized to 0 and other arrays to be initialized to NIL .
I did n't have a good reason to expect that , it 's just what my implementation seemed always to do .
I learned the correct expectation after using an implementation that puts random garbage into arrays that are n't explicitly initialized .
I thought it might be a bug until I actually read the specification .
Take a look .
Can you suggest some more to add ?
Introduction
Malicious attacks against computers are on the rise .
Although fewer viruses have been written to attack GNU / Linux systems than Windows systems , GNU / Linux viruses do exist .
Furthermore , the amount of other types of malware that can infect a computer running Linux — as well as the sheer number of attacks — are growing .
Recently Wirenet . 1 attacked computers running Linux and Mac OS X .
The malware stole passwords and other information stored in the computer ’s Internet browser , email client , and instant messaging tool .
How myths about security grow
When mischief was the focus for malicious hackers , Windows systems were the primary target because they were easy to use and many novice users bought them .
Some attacks were motivated by the desire to bring negative publicity to Microsoft , which was perceived as not supporting the open source community .
These attacks fostered myths in computing circles that Windows security was weak .
Platform - independent environments such as OpenOffice.org , Perl , and Mozilla Firefox are not exempt .
For example , Dropper .
MsPMs , a malicious Java archive ( JAR ) file , was found on machines running Windows , Mac OS X , and Linux .
Some malware packages are written specifically for GNU / Linux .
A rootkit — a collection of tools that let an attacker gain access to the root ( administrator ) account on your computer — are part of the same software family as Trojan horses .
These malware packages go by different names such as tOrn and ARK .
Protecting against malware
Many factors determine how secure a system is , but the most important is how the system is configured .
This article addresses the configuration of the GNU / Linux desktop .
By taking the steps to configure your computer system properly , you can make sure it ’s secure .
The place to start is with anti-virus protection .
Install antivirus protection : ClamAV
ClamAV is an open source ( GPL ) antivirus engine designed for detecting Trojans , viruses , malware , and other malicious threats .
When installing it , you can specify whether you want to run the program manually or have it run continually by connecting it to a daemon .
For a desktop , running the program as a daemon is ideal because you still have the option of performing manual scans .
To install ClamAV as a continually running daemon , perform these steps :
Power up your computer and log in .
From the menu bar , click Applications >
Accessories > Terminal .
When the terminal is launched , enter the following command : sudo apt - get install clamav - daemon Show more Show more icon
When prompted , enter your password .
Doing so installs a package called clamav - freshclam , which is the updater package for the ClamAV application .
You now see a message indicating how much disk space will be used when you install the software .
Enter Y at the prompt to begin installation .
The installation process should take only a couple of minutes .
When it finishes , you see an alert indicating that your virus database is older than x days and that you should update it using the next series of steps .
At the prompt , run the command sudo freshclam .
Running freshclam updates your virus definitions to the latest release .
Keeping your definitions up - to - date is important , because this is how ClamAV identifies malware .
Virus definitions are patterns of code unique to malware programs .
Antivirus scanners compare the contents of your files to the code patterns in a virus definitions database .
If a match is found , the program alerts you that an infected file resides on your computer and prevents code in that file from executing .
If the definition for a particular piece of malware is n’t in your virus definitions database , the antivirus scanner wo n’t know it ’s malicious code and lets it run and do whatever damage it was programmed to do .
Update your definitions on a regular basis to provide the most comprehensive protection you can .
Starting ClamAV
ClamTk : A GUI for your antivirus application
If you do n’t like working from the terminal , you can opt to install a GUI for ClamAV called ClamTk .
This GUI is easy to install using the Add / Remove Applications tool in Ubuntu .
Once installed , run it by clicking Applications > System Tools > Virus Scanner .
Now that you ’ve updated your virus definitions , you ’re ready to start ClamAV .
To run a manual scan of your home folder , go to the terminal prompt and enter clamscan .
When the clamscan command finishes , you see a report of how many directories and files were scanned and how many infected files were found .
To run ClamAV as a daemon , go to the terminal prompt and enter clamdscan .
The clamdscan command creates a user named ClamAV .
You can then add this user to the group that owns the files you want to scan .
Protect against rootkits with rkhunter
Probably the most dangerous malware that GNU / Linux users face is the rootkit .
The Rootkit Hunter ( rkhunter ) and chkrootkit programs scan your desktop for suspicious files that an attacker may have installed to gain control of your computer .
To install rkhunter , one of the best programs for finding and removing rootkits , perform these steps :
To navigate back into the terminal , click Applications > Accessories > Terminal .
In the terminal shell , enter the following command : sudo aptitude install rkhunter Show more Show more icon
When you receive a message informing you of how much space the software will use , enter Y to begin installation .
When rkhunter has been installed , you can run it to check your desktop for exploits .
Go to the terminal prompt and enter sudo rkhunter -- check .
If rkhunter is running properly , you see a list of directories with the word OK or Warning next to them .
When started , rkhunter performs several types of scans .
After one scan finishes , begin the next by pressing Enter .
The types of scans are :
Directories
Exploits on the desktop
Ports that are commonly used for backdoor access
Startup files , groups and accounts , system configuration files , the file system
Applications
After all the scans are complete , rkhunter provides you with a report and creates a log file with the results .
As with ClamAV , you need to update rkhunter regularly so that it can detect the latest vulnerabilities and exploits :
From the terminal , enter sudo rkhunter -- update .
When prompted , enter your password .
Use Tiger to scan your system
In terms of security , establishing a baseline is one of the most important things you can do .
From there , you can tell if anything has been tampered with , because it alters the baseline .
If you install an office productivity suite , you also alter the baseline , but you approved that addition .
If a piece of malware is installed to your machine , a check against the baseline should reveal this , as well .
Most people do n’t have any idea how to manually create a baseline of their computer ’s configuration .
However , a program called Tiger audits the computer system to see whether anything has been altered .
If it has , the software provides an error code .
To install Tiger on your Ubuntu desktop , start by opening the terminal .
From there , run the following command :
sudo aptitude -y install tiger
Show more Show more icon
That command puts the software on your machine .
Now , you need to run it .
With the terminal still open , run sudo tiger to create a report of security issues , and save that report to / var / log / tiger .
The name of the file often contains the computer ’s hostname followed by the date and time — for example , security.report.hostname.121220-8:46 .
The name of the file is provided to you when the report is complete .
To view the report , run sudo gedit and include / var / log / tiger and the file name .
Using this example , the command is :
sudo gedit /var/ log/tiger/security.report.hostname.121220-8:46
Show more
Show more icon
The report then provides error codes for the problems it finds .
You can find the meaning of each error code online ( see Related topics ) .
Using a firewall
The next preventative step you should take is to use the firewall built into your operating system .
Ubuntu , by default , runs iptables as the firewall on every distribution .
Upon installation , the default settings for this firewall allow all incoming and outgoing traffic .
To make effective use of the firewall , you need to create rules to lock down your desktop .
You can configure iptables through the terminal , but you can also write firewall rules with a GUI called Gufw based on the Uncomplicated Firewall ( UFW ) program that comes with Ubuntu .
Install Gufw by opening the terminal and running the following command :
sudo apt - get install gufw Show more
Show more icon
When the installation is complete , you can access it from System > Administration > Firewall .
When opened , enable Gufw , which is disabled by default .
Under the heading Actual Status , click the Enabled check box to turn it on .
Doing so sets all incoming traffic to Deny .
Then click
Add to create rules according to how you want UFW to handle certain types of traffic based on the four available options :

The system denies entry traffic to a port and informs the requesting for connection system that it has been rejected .
Limit .
The system denies connections if an IP address has attempted to initiate six or more connections in the past 30 seconds .
When you click Add , a window appears with three tabs : Preconfigured , Simple , and Advanced .
The Preconfigured tab is the easiest way to create rules , because you select what you want to allow or deny from a drop - down list , as shown in Figure 1 :
Preconfigured rules
With the Simple tab , you can tell UFW whether you want to allow or deny something and then select the protocol / service and port number .
See Figure 2 :
Simple rules
You can fine - tune the rule even further with the Advanced tab .

Backing up and restoring desktop files
Another step in protecting your GNU / Linux desktop involves establishing a backup and recovery process .
At one time you had to install backup and recovery software in most Linux distributions .
However , the need to have a sound disaster recovery solution prompted many to include some sort of backup and recovery software in the installation .
Ubuntu relies on Duplicity , a program that uses rsync .
To make things even easier , Ubuntu comes with Deja Dup , a graphical front end to Duplicity .
To get started with Deja Dup , click System Settings from the gear icon .
In the System Settings window , click Backup .
Before you turn on automatic backups , click Storage to set the backup location .
You can use Ubuntu One ( a cloud storage option ) , send your backups to another server through FTP , save to a local folder , or set a custom location .
When you determine the best location for your backup files , click Folders to select what you want to back up .
You have two options here : Folders to back up and Folders to ignore .
You can add or delete any folders from either column .
Now , click Schedule to tell Deja Dup how often to run your backups and how long to keep them .
You can opt to back up daily , weekly , biweekly , or monthly , and these backups can be stored for at least one week to at least one year or even forever .
Now , go back to Overview and slide Automatic backups to On .
That ’s all it takes .
If you ever need to restore files , click Restore , and Deja Dup will ask you from where you want to restore , from what date , and to what location you would like to restore your files .
It ’s a good idea to make sure your backups are working properly by restoring files every now and again .
Many attacks against computers are launched when a malicious hacker finds a vulnerability in the operating system software or another piece of software .
Security experts look for these vulnerabilities and create software patches and updates to plug the holes .
Keep your software up to date .
Most operating systems have a built - in feature that informs you when updates are available , and many of the GNU / Linux distributions include this type of functionality .
Click the gear icon on the menu bar of the desktop , then click Software Up to Date to launch the Update Manager .
The Update Manager usually opens on its own when new updates are available .
In the Update Manager window , you can click Install Updates .
You can also choose how often and what software you want to update by clicking Settings .
The default options should be good as long as the Important security updates check box is selected and the When there are security updates option is set to Download and install automatically .
Password - protecting the bootloader
When you use GNU / Linux , you can boot the computer to change the root password without having to enter a password .
This is called single - user mode .
To password - protect this feature , you have two bootloader options : GRUB and LILO .
If you use GRUB , you can encrypt your password to make things even more secure .
Users of LILO do not have this option .
If you use GRUB , perform these steps :
Launch the terminal .
At the prompt , enter grub .
To make sure you do n’t store the password you ’re going to create in plain text , enter md5crypt .
At the prompt , enter the password you want to use for single - user mode .
You are then given an encrypted version of the password .
Do n’t close this terminal window — you ’ll need this encrypted password in the next steps .
Now , you need to edit the GRUB configuration file .
Of course , back it up first :
Enter the following command : sudo cp / boot / grub / menu.lst /boot/grub/menu.lst-backup
Show more
Show more icon
When prompted , enter your password .
Enter the following command : gedit / boot / grub / menu.lst
Show more
Show more icon
This takes you to the GRUB configuration file .
Locate the line in the file that reads password -- md5 and replace the existing password with the encrypted password you created earlier .
Listing 1 shows what your GRUB configuration file should look like when the password has been changed : GRUB configuration file , after the password change #
Set a timeout , in SEC seconds before automatically booting the default entry # ( normally the first entry defined ) .
timeout 3 ## hiddenmenu #
Hides the menu by default ( press ESC to see the menu ) hiddenmenu # Pretty colours # color cyan / blue while / blue ## password ['- - md5 ' ] passwd #

# password topsecret # # examples # # title Windows 95/98/NT/2000

Show more icon
Unlike GRUB , LILO does n’t allow for encrypted passwords .
If you ’re using the LILO bootloader , perform these steps :
Launch the terminal .
At the prompt , enter edit cat /etc/lilo.conf .
When the editor opens , search for the password section and create a new password there .
Conclusion
This article has introduced a few tools that can help you harden your GNU / Linux desktop .
Even if you install all the tools available to protect your computer and the data stored on it , ultimately , you ’re responsible for using those tools .
Bayern Munich have signed a MOU with the West Bengal government to create an academy to sell Bayern Munich shirts help nurture talent in India .
The Kolkata project will be the first Bayern Academy outside Germany and has Karl - Heinze Rummenigge really excited :
“ India is among the biggest countries in the world and I believe it is a good time now that such a country is ready to participate in a World Cup . ”
We ’ve previously covered Arsenal conducting football trials in India , Manchester United discuss the chances of going to India , Chelsea serve as a backdrop for an Indian movie and even Diego Maradona head to India in recent times .
Rummenigge is adamant that Bayern there to stay and not to make a quick buck – unlike , say , Bayern Munich who went to Malta to play a few games in order to bolster their 2006 World Cup bid ( source : Andrew Jennings ) .
Bayern Munich ladies and gentleman , coming soon to a city near you ( if you happen to live in India , that is ) .
If you were buying a new car and your primary goal was performance , or more specifically raw power – given the choice between a 4 cylinder and a 8 cylinder engine , the choice is obvious .
Bigger is better .
Generally when we look at computers the same applies , or at least that is how the products are marketed .
Thus a 64bit system should out - perform a 32 bit system , in the same way that a quad core system should be faster than a dual core .
Of course , what a lot of the world is only starting to understand is that more is n’t always better when it comes to computers .
When dealing with multiple CPUs , you ’ve got to find something useful for those extra processing units to do .
Sometimes your workload is fundamentally single - threaded and you have to let all those other cores sit idle .
The 32 bit vs. 64 bit distinction is a bit more subtle .
The x86 - 64 architecture adds not only bigger registers to the x86 architecture , but more registers .
Generally this translates to better performance in benchmarks ( as having more registers allows the compilers to create better machine code ) .
Unfortunately until recently , moving from a 32 bit java to a 64 bit java mean taking a performance hit .
When we go looking at java performance , there are really 2 areas of the runtime that matter : the JIT and the GC .
The job of the JIT is to make the code that is running execute as fast as possible .
The GC is designed to take as little time away from the executing of code as possible ( while still managing memory ) .
Thus java performance is all about making the JIT generate more optimal code ( more registers helps ) , and reducing the time the GC has to use to mange memory ( bigger pointers makes this harder ) .
J9 was originally designed for 32 bit systems and this influenced some of the early decisions we made in the code base .
Years earlier I had spent some time with a PowerPC system that ran in 64 bit mode trying to get our Smalltalk VM running on it , and had reached the conclusion that the most straight forward solution was simply to make all of the data structures ( objects ) twice as big to handle the 64bit pointers .
With J9 development ( circa 2001 ) , one of the first 64 bit systems we got our hands on was a Dec Alpha so we applied the straight forward ‘ fattening ’ solution , allowing a common code base to support both 32bits and 64bits .
A 64bit CPU will have a wide data bus , but recall that this same 64 bit CPU can run 32 bit code as well and it still has the big wide data bus to move things around with .
When we look at our 64 bit solution of allowing the data to be twice as big , we ’re actually at a disadvantage relative to 32 bits on the same hardware .
This is n’t a problem unique to J9 , or even Java – all 64 bit programs need to address this data expansion .
It turns out that the dynamics of the java language just tend to make this a more acute problem as java programs tend to be all about creating , and manipulating objects ( aka data structures ) .
The solution to this performance issue is to be smarter about the data structures .
This is exactly what we did in the IBM Java6 JDK with the compressed references feature .
We can play tricks ( and not get caught ) because the user ( java programmer ) does n’t know the internal representation of the java objects .
The trade off is that by storing less information in the object , we limit the total amount of memory that can be used by the JVM .
This is currently an acceptable solution , as computer memory sizes are nowhere near the full 64 bit address range .
We only use 32 bits to store pointers , and take advantage of 8 byte aligned objects to get a few free bits [ pointer << 3 ] .
Thus the IBM Java6 JDK using compressed references ( - Xcompressedrefs ) can address up to 32 Gb of heap .
We ’re not the only ones doing this trick , Oracle / BEA have the - XXcompressedRefs option and Sun has the - XX : +UseCompressedOops option .
Of course , each of the vendors implementations are slightly different with different limitations and levels of support .
Primarily you see these flags used in benchmarking , but as some of our customers are starting to run into heap size limitations on 32 bit operating systems they are looking to move to 64bit systems ( but would like to avoid giving up any performance ) .
There is a post on the websphere community blog that talks about the IBM JDK compressed references and has some pretty graphs showing the benefits .
And Billy Newport gives a nice summary of why this feature is exciting .

Mr Bush held talks with Mr Sarkozy and EU Commission head Manuel Barroso President George W Bush has invited world leaders to gather in the US by the end of the year to discuss reform of the global financial system .
The summit would be the first of a series announced after talks between Mr Bush , French President Nicolas Sarkozy and EU Commission chief Manuel Barroso .
But the agenda is unclear and differences are already emerging .
Mr Bush said any plan must not undermine free markets .
Mr Sarkozy said " hateful practices " must be abandoned .
Before he arrived at Camp David , the US presidential retreat in the state of Maryland , the French leader warned the world could not " continue to run the economy of the 21st Century with instruments of the economy of the 20th Century " .
Calls for action
After the meeting , Mr Bush said : " It is essential that we work together because we are in this crisis together . "
Together we will work to modernise and strengthen our nations ' financial systems so we can help ensure this crisis does n't happen again
US President George W Bush
He went on to invite world leaders to an economic summit after the US election in November , to discuss responses to the current financial crisis .
" Together we will work to modernise and strengthen our nations ' financial systems so we can help ensure this crisis does n't happen again , " he added .
But Mr Bush said any plan to rethink financial mechanisms should " preserve the foundations of democratic capitalism " and include " a commitment to free markets , free enterprise and free trade " .
' New order ' Mr Sarkozy said the crisis could offer a " great opportunity " to build the capitalism of the future and leave behind the " hateful practices " of the past .
We cannot continue along the same lines because the same problems will trigger the same disasters
French President Nicolas Sarkozy
" We cannot continue along the same lines because the same problems will trigger the same disasters , " he warned .
Mr Sarkozy said the hedge funds , tax havens and financial institutions operating without supervision should all be re-thought .
" This is no longer acceptable , " he added .
" This sort of capitalism is a betrayal of the sort of capitalism we believe in . "
European Commission President Manuel Barroso , who also took part in the talks , said : " We need a new global financial order . "
Details of the summits are still to be worked out , but White House spokesman Tony Fratto said the first was likely to be held in November .
He added that Mr Sarkozy had recommended New York as a location .
UN Secretary General Ban Ki-moon has proposed using the organisation 's headquarters there as a venue .
A global summit would echo the Bretton Woods conference in 1944
That summit would seek to " review progress being made to address the current crisis and to seek agreement on principles of reform needed to avoid a repetition , " the leaders said in their statement .
" Later summits would be designed to implement agreement on specific steps to be taken to meet those principles , " it added .
Other world leaders are to be consulted over the plan .
Correspondents say such meetings would echo the Bretton Woods conference of 44 nations after World War II , which established many of the institutions and monetary systems that are now under threat .

What are these ?
Niger has frequently suffered food crises and malnutrition Medical charity Medecins Sans Frontieres ( MSF ) has rebutted claims that it exaggerated the number of malnourished children in Niger .
The charity has appealed to be allowed to resume work in the region of Maradi , where Niger 's government ordered it to stop operating in July .
MSF said some 8,000 children had since been deprived of treatment .
The BBC's Idy Baraou reports from Niger that there are fears of a malnutrition epidemic in coming months .
Human rights groups report that government hospitals are not adequately equipped to deal with the challenge , he says .
The situation is critical
Marie - Pierre Allie
MSF president But Niger 's Health Minister Issa Lamine told state radio at the weekend that the situation in Maradi was " not dramatic " and that the local health authorities could handle it .
Niger 's government has accused MSF of working illegally , inventing numbers for malnourished children , and conducting propaganda about famine in order to raise money .
However , MSF President Marie - Pierre Allie said her organisation had been using figures provided by Niger 's health ministry .
" Saying that MSF is forging numbers to collect money is unacceptable , " she told the BBC's Focus on Africa programme .
" MSF is communicating to report on the situation , what 's happening to the population we 're serving , and not to collect money . "
" The situation is critical .
There is a high number of malnourished kids waiting for care in the hospitals , in the health centres , and there are many , many kids not even coming to these structures , " she said .
" What I 've been hearing in Maradi from the health staff is that they cannot face the situation today - that too many kids were in need of care . "

A while ago I started development of special branch of PulseAudio which is called glitch - free .
In a few days I will merge it back to PulseAudio trunk , and eventually release it as 0.9.11 .
I think it 's time to explain a little what all this " glitch - freeness " is about , what made it so tricky to implement , and why this is totally awesome technology .
So , here we go :
Traditional Playback Model
Traditionally on most operating systems audio is scheduled via sound card interrupts ( IRQs ) .
When an application opens a sound card for playback it configures it for a fixed size playback buffer .
Then it fills this buffer with digital PCM sample data .
And after that it tells the hardware to start playback .
Then , the hardware reads the samples from the buffer , one at a time , and passes it on to the DAC so that eventually it reaches the speakers .
After a certain number of samples played the sound hardware generates an interrupt .
This interrupt is forwarded to the application .
On Linux / Unix this is done via poll ( ) / select ( ) , which the application uses to sleep on the sound card file descriptor .
When the application is notified via this interrupt it overwrites the samples that were just played by the hardware with new data and goes to sleep again .
When the next interrupt arrives the next block of samples is overwritten , and so on and so on .
When the hardware reaches the end of the hardware buffer it starts from its beginning again , in a true ring buffer fashion .
This goes on and on and on .
The number of samples after which an interrupt is generated is usually called a fragment ( ALSA likes to call the same thing a period for some reason ) .
The number of fragments the entire playback buffer is split into is usually integral and usually a power of two , 2 and 4 being the most frequently used values .
Image 1 : Schematic overview of the playback buffer in the traditional playback model , in the best way the author can visualize this with his limited drawing abilities .
If the application is not quick enough to fill up the hardware buffer again after an interrupt we get a buffer underrun ( " drop - out " ) .
An underrun is clearly hearable by the user as a discontinuity in audio which is something we clearly do n't want .
We thus have to carefully make sure that the buffer and fragment sizes are chosen in a way that the software has enough time to calculate the data that needs to be played , and the OS has enough time to forward the interrupt from the hardware to the userspace software and the write request back to the hardware .
Depending on the requirements of the application the size of the playback buffer is chosen .
It can be as small as 4ms for low - latency applications ( such as music synthesizers ) , or as long as 2s for applications where latency does n't matter ( such as music players ) .
The hardware buffer size directly translates to the latency that the playback adds to the system .
The smaller the fragment sizes the application configures , the more time the application has to fill up the playback buffer again .
Let 's formalize this a bit : Let BUF_SIZE be the size of the hardware playback buffer in samples , FRAG_SIZE the size of one fragment in samples , and NFRAGS the number of fragments the buffer is split into ( equivalent to BUF_SIZE divided by FRAG_SIZE ) , RATE the sampling rate in samples per second .
Then , the overall latency is identical to BUF_SIZE / RATE .
An interrupt is generated every FRAG_SIZE / RATE .
Every time one of those interrupts is generated the application should fill up one fragment again , if it missed one interrupt this might become more than one .
If it does n't miss any interrupt it has ( NFRAGS -1 ) * FRAG_SIZE / RATE time to fulfill the request .
If it needs more time than this we 'll get an underrun .
The fill level of the playback buffer should thus usually oscillate between BUF_SIZE and ( NFRAGS -1 ) * FRAG_SIZE .
In case of missed interrupts it might however fall considerably lower , in the worst case to 0 which is , again , an underrun .
It is difficult to choose the buffer and fragment sizes in an optimal way for an application :
The buffer size should be as large as possible to minimize the risk of drop - outs .
The buffer size should be as small as possible to guarantee minimal latencies .
The fragment size should be as large as possible to minimize the number of interrupts , and thus the required CPU time used , to maximize the time the CPU can sleep for between interrupts and thus the battery lifetime ( i.e. the fewer interrupts are generated the lower your audio app will show up in powertop , and that 's what all is about , right ? )
The fragment size should be as small as possible to give the application as much time as possible to fill up the playback buffer , to minimize drop - outs .
As you can easily see it is impossible to choose buffering metrics in a way that they are optimal on all four requirements .
This traditional model has major drawbacks :
The buffering metrics are highly dependant on what the sound hardware can provide .
Portable software needs to be able to deal with hardware that can only provide a very limited set of buffer and fragment sizes .
The buffer metrics are configured only once , when the device is opened , they usually cannot be reconfigured during playback without major discontinuities in audio .
This is problematic if more than one application wants to output audio at the same time via a sound server ( or dmix ) and they have different requirements on latency .
For these sound servers / dmix the fragment metrics are configured statically in a configuration file , and are the same during the whole lifetime .
If a client connects that needs lower latencies , it basically lost .
If a client connects that does n't need as low latencies , we will continouisly burn more CPU / battery than necessary .
) and they have different requirements on latency .

If a client connects that needs lower latencies , it basically lost .
If a client connects that does n't need as low latencies , we will continouisly burn more CPU / battery than necessary .
It is practically impossible to choose the buffer metrics optimal for your application -- there are too many variables in the equation : you can't know anything about the IRQ / scheduling latencies of the OS / machine your software will be running on ; you cannot know how much time it will actually take to produce the audio data that shall be pushed to the audio device ( unless you start counting cycles , which is a good way to make your code unportable ) ; the scheduling latencies are hugely dependant on the system load on most current OSes ( unless you have an RT system , which we generally do not have ) .
As said , for sound servers / dmix it is impossible to know in advance what the requirements on latency are that the applications that might eventually connect will have .
Since the number of fragments is integral and at least 2 on almost all existing hardware we will generate at least two interrupts on each buffer iteration .
If we fix the buffer size to 2s then we will generate an interrupt at least every 1s .
We 'd then have 1s to fill up the buffer again -- on all modern systems this is far more than we 'd ever need .
It would be much better if we could fix the fragment size to 1.9s , which still gives us 100 ms to fill up the playback buffer again , still more than necessary on most systems .
Due to the limitations of this model most current ( Linux / Unix ) software uses buffer metrics that turned out to " work most of the time " , very often they are chosen without much thinking , by copying other people 's code , or totally at random .
PulseAudio <= 0.9.10 uses a fragment size of 25 ms by default , with four fragments .
That means that right now , unless you reconfigure your PulseAudio manually clients will not get latencies lower than 100ms whatever you try , and as long as music is playing you will get 40 interrupts / s . ( The relevant configuration options for PulseAudio are default - fragments = and default - fragment - size - msec= in daemon.conf )
dmix uses 16 fragments by default with a size of 21 ms each ( on my system at least -- this varies , depending on your hardware ) .
You can't get less than 47 interrupts / s. ( You can change the parameters in .asoundrc )
So much about the traditional model and its limitations .
Now , we 'll have a peek on how the new glitch - free branch of PulseAudio does its things .
The technology is not really new .
It 's inspired by what Vista does these days and what Apple CoreAudio has already been doing for quite a while .
However , on Linux this technology is new , we have been lagging behind quite a bit .
Also I claim that what PA does now goes beyond what Vista / MacOS does in many ways , though of course , they provide much more than we provide in many other ways .
The name glitch - free is inspired by the term Microsoft uses to call this model , however I must admit that I am not sure that my definition of this term and theirs actually is the same .
Glitch - Free Playback Model
The first basic idea of the glitch - free playback model ( a better , less marketingy name is probably timer - based audio scheduling which is the term I internally use in the PA codebase ) is to no longer depend on sound card interrupts to schedule audio but use system timers instead .
System timers are far more flexible then the fragment - based sound card timers .
They can be reconfigured at any time , and have a granularity that is independant from any buffer metrics of the sound card .
The second basic idea is to use playback buffers that are as large as possible , up to a limit of 2s or 5s .
The third basic idea is to allow rewriting of the hardware buffer at any time .
This allows instant reaction on user - input ( i.e. pause / seek requests in your music player , or instant event sounds ) although the huge latency imposed by the hardware playback buffer would suggest otherwise .
PA configures the audio hardware to the largest playback buffer size possible , up to 2s .
The sound card interrupts are disabled as far as possible ( most of the time this means to simply lower NFRAGS to the minimal value supported by the hardware .
It would be great if ALSA would allow us to disable sound card interrupts entirely ) .
Then , PA constantly determines what the minimal latency requirement of all connected clients is .
If no client specified any requirements we fill up the whole buffer all the time , i.e. have an actual latency of 2s .
However , if some applications specified requirements , we take the lowest one and only use as much of the configured hardware buffer as this value allows us .
In practice , this means we only partially fill the buffer each time we wake up .
Then , we configure a system timer to wake us up 10 ms before the buffer would run empty and fill it up again then .
If the overall latency is configured to less than 10ms we wakeup after half the latency requested .
If the sleep time turns out to be too long ( i.e. it took more than 10 ms to fill up the hardware buffer ) we will get an underrun .
If this happens we can double the time we wake up before the buffer would run empty , to 20ms , and so on .
If we notice that we only used much less than the time we estimated , we can halve this value again .
This adaptive scheme makes sure that in the unlikely event of a buffer underrun it will happen most likely only once and never again .
When a new client connects or an existing client disconnects , or when a client wants to rewrite what it already wrote , or the user wants to change the volume of one of the streams , then PA will resample its data passed by the client , convert it to the proper hardware sample type , and remix it with the data of the other clients .
This of course makes it necessary to keep a " history " of data of all clients around so that if one client requests a rewrite we have the necessary data around to remix what already was mixed before .
The benefits of this model are manyfold :
We minimize the overall number of interrupts , down to what the latency requirements of the connected clients allow us .
i.e. we save power , do n't show up in powertop anymore for normal music playback .
We maximize drop - out safety , because we buffer up to 2s in the usual cases .
Only with operating systems which have scheduling latencies >
2s we can still get drop - outs .
Thankfully no operating system is that bad .
In the event of an underrun we do n't get stuck in it , but instead are able to recover quickly and can make sure it does n't happen again .
We provide " zero- latency " .
Each client can rewrite its playback buffer at any time , and this is forwarded to the hardware , even if this means that the sample currently being played needs to be rewritten .
This means much quicker reaction to user input , a more responsive user experience .
We become much less dependant on what the sound hardware provides us with .
We can configure wakeup times that are independant from the fragment settings that the hardware actually supports .
We can provide almost any latency a client might request , dynamically without reconfiguration , without discontinuities in audio .
Of course , this scheme also comes with major complications :
System timers and sound card timers deviate .
On many sound cards by quite a bit .
Also , not all sound cards allow the user to query the playback frame index at any time , but only shortly after each IRQ .
To compensate for this deviation PA contains a non-trivial algorithm which tries to estimate and follow the deviation over time .
If this does n't work properly it might happen that an underrun happens much earlier than we expected .
System timers on Unix are not very high precision .
On traditional Linux with HZ=100 sleep times for timers are rounded up to multiples of 10 ms .
Only very recent Linux kernels with hrtimers can provide something better , but only on x86 and x86 - 64 until now .
This makes the whole scheme unusable for low latency setups unless you run the very latest Linux .
Also , hrtimers are not ( yet ) exposed in poll ( ) / select ( ) .
It requires major jumping through loops to work around this limitation .

It requires major jumping through loops to work around this limitation .
We need to keep a history of sample data for each stream around , thus increasing the memory footprint and potentially increased cache pressure .
PA tries to work against the increased memory footprint and cache pressure this might cause by doing zero - copy memory management .
We 're still dependant on the maximum playback buffer size the sound hardware supports .
Many sound cards do n't even support 2s , but only 300 ms or suchlike .
The rewriting of the client buffers causing rewriting of the hardware buffer complicates the resampling / converting step immensly .
In general the code to implement this model is more complex than for the traditional model .
Also , ALSA has not really been designed with this design in mind , which makes some things very hard to get right and suboptimal .
Generally , this works reliably only on newest ALSA , newest kernel , newest everything .
It has pretty steep requirements on software and sometimes even on hardware .
To stay comptible with systems that do n't fulfill these requirements we need to carry around code for the traditional playback model as well , increasing the code base by far .
The advantages of the scheme clearly outweigh the complexities it causes .
Especially the power - saving features of glitch - free PA should be enough reason for the embedded Linux people to adopt it quickly .
Make PA disappear from powertop even if you play music !
The code in the glitch - free is still rough and sometimes incomplete .
I will merge it shortly into trunk and then upload a snapshot to Rawhide .
I hope this text also explains to the few remaining PA haters a little better why PA is a good thing , and why everyone should have it on his Linux desktop .
Of course these changes are not visible on the surface , my hope with this blog story is to explain a bit better why infrastructure matters , and counter misconceptions what PA actually is and what it gives you on top of ALSA .
There are many different takes on if a mirror should be in a bedroom .
Some believe that a mirror should not be in the bedroom because at night your energy and soul rises , which could get stuck in the mirror and not return to your body .
Another logical reason is that having a mirror can make the room very yang due to the reflection of light .
So if you sleep in a room with a lot of mirrors , the morning sun may be reflected and provide a poor quality of sleep .
This does not mean you can't have mirrors in the bedroom , you just may want to limit the size or number of mirrors .
I personally do n't see a problem with having mirrors in the bedroom unless you are older and in poor health .
Many times , having a mirror in the bedroom can actually enhance and improve a relationship .
John McCain ’s campaign suffered another setback last night when his running mate and the official Republican candidate for Vice President announced that she had decided she would be voting for Senator Obama on November 4th .
‘ I do n’t really know much about this whole politics thing , but it just seems to me that Obama is not just for change but change we can believe in , ’ said the Alaskan governor sporting her new Obama / Biden lapel badge .
‘ Also I heard he chose someone really dumb to be his running mate , and that sounds kinda dumb ’ she added looking pleased that she seemed to have made the Press Corps laugh .
Sarah Palin represents the latest in a series of high profile Republicans who have come out for the Democratic candidate .
John McCain refused to accept that having his running mate vote for his opponent represented any sort of a set - back and claimed that many people would be switching their allegiance back and forth over the next week or so .
‘ But I still believe that my wife and I will be on our way to the White House by next Tuesday , ’ he declared .
At this point Cindy McCain leaned forward to interject , announcing that in fact she had decided to vote for Obama as well .
Although she did n’t know the Democratic candidate as well as her own husband , she admitted , she felt he offered the kind of optimism and fresh start that America needed right now .
‘ And he is n’t going to drop dead after a year in office and let that mad woman take over the United States either . ’
In another blow to the Republican ticket , President George W. Bush also said that McCain was too closely associated with the disastrous policies of the last eight years , and that somebody had to do something about the terrible mess out there in Iraq .
McCain had also rather been counting on the vote of the Grand Master of the Ku Klux Klan , but the White Supremacist also confessed that he had been won over by the charismatic Illinois Senator .
‘ Sure race is an issue , but we have to look at it in context of a whole lot of other factors .
Some say many southerners will switch back to McCain at the last minute as voters suddenly pander to racism .
But we ’re all really hoping America will pander to ageism instead . ’

Quantum key distribution ( QKD ) has been touted as the ultimate solution for obtaining technological communications security .
It ca n't secure people against their own foibles , but it is supposed to ensure that a network can securely distribute a series of one - time cyphers for later use in normal communications .
Unfortunately , as demonstrated by a recent hack of a commercial QKD system , this might prove to be a pipe dream .
QKD obtains security by using the fundamental laws of quantum mechanics to determine that there is no third party ( commonly called Eve ) listening in on data transfered between two parties , usually referred to as Alice and Bob .
The basic process involves Alice sending both herself and Bob a set of random numbers encoded in the quantum properties of light .
Bob and Alice both measure these properties , obtaining two different strings of random numbers .
Alice then tells
Bob how she made her measurements , while Bob tells Alice how he made his measurements .
They then look for coincidences where they both made the same measurement , and use those parts of the string to create a fully private key to encrypt their data .
If Eve should decide to try to listen in , she will , in some manner , make measurements as if she were Bob .
In doing so , she alters the quantum properties of the data stream , and Bob , Alice , and Eve all end up with different strings .
When Bob and Alice look for coincidences , they find fewer than expected and conclude that Eve is hanging about ; they can then abandon the key and try again .
There are a number of ways to attack this system , but they are all pretty impractical , as they rely on making measurements we do n't know how to make yet , or the possibility that Bob would n't notice that his detectors are all simultaneously clicking at a constant rate .
The point is , theoretical attacks exist , but practical ones do n't : QKD 1 , real world 0 .
The real point of weakness in a QKD system is the public communications that are required for Bob and Alice to tell each other how they made their measurements .
In principle , you can learn nothing beyond the number of bits sent , and which bit positions can be used to generate a secret key unless , two conditions are met :
Eve must control the arrival time of the bits at Bob 's detectors , and Bob 's detectors must not be identical .
The first condition is easily met if you insert switches and rolls of fiber optic cable and a few other optic devices to keep the optical pulse length right — actually , making it shorter is even better , and this is possible also .
The second condition is always met .
No two detectors are ever exactly identical .
The idea behind the detectors is that a sensitive material absorbs a photon and produces some electrons in response , giving Bob an electronic click .
But not every photon will trigger a click , and the ratio of success to failure depends on the exact properties of the absorbing material .
In this way , detectors are always different because , for instance , the exact level of impurity doping will be different .
One consequence of this plays out in the detector 's recovery time .
After detecting a photon , the detector is rendered insensitive for a certain time , and that time will not be identical for both detectors .
If Eve knows the exact mismatch of Bob 's detectors , then she can insert an appropriate delay and know that there is a higher probability that a particular detector will click and can make an educated guess regarding the bit value it clicks with .
Eve faces a problem though : what delay is appropriate ?
She can figure that out by trying different delay values and listening to Alice and Bob 's classical communications .
As the ratios of ones and zeros change , she can figure out how long each detector takes to recover and what their detection efficiencies are for each delay .
With this information , Eve can choose two delays that give the highest probability that Bob either gets a click on one detector or another .
From Bob and Alice 's communication , Eve might get the whole key , or at least enough of it so that a brute force attack can succeed .
The researchers themselves were quite surprised at how effective their attack was .
The tone of their paper makes it clear that they expected to fail ( in practical terms anyway ) .
They make the point that the hypothetical Eve in security papers is usually far more powerful than their Eve , yet their Eve succeeds because one cannot build a system that is invulnerable .
In fact , the detector mismatch problem will never go away , and the only thing device designers can do to minimize the chance of a successful attack against this weakness is to devise ever more complicated protocols .

MSNBC ' votes for four more years ' of Olbermann RAW STORY
Published : Monday November 10 , 2008
Print This Email This Firebrand MSNBC host Keith Olbermann will be hosting Countdown for at another four years , the network announced Monday .
Network president Phil Griffin called Olbermann " the core of MSNBC 's current success . "
The anchor 's impassioned rants aimed at President Bush , John McCain and Republicans in general coincided with a significant uptick in the third - place cable network 's ratings .
" I 'm delighted that we can continue to lock Countdown into the nation 's political dialogue through at least the next election , " Olbermann said in a news release .
" Personally , I noticed that as of about six weeks ago , I 'd been doing this show longer than I did SportsCenter , so it 's delightful to have a true home . "
The deal comes just two years into Olbermann 's existing four - year contract with the network .
MSNBC outlined Countdown 's ratings gains in a news release Monday .
In October 2008 , " Countdown with Keith Olbermann " had its best month ever in the key Adults 25 - 54 demographic , and is up a tremendous 170 percent in A25 - 54 from Oct. 2007 and up 180 percent in total viewers .
" Countdown " continued its dominance over CNN at 8 p.m. , out - rating " Campbell Brown " by 35 percent in A25 - 54 and 41 percent in total viewers .
Excluding coverage of the presidential debates , " Countdown " is the # 3 top- rated show in cable news in A25 - 54 .
" Countdown " is also the # 1 cable news show among young viewers , Adults 18 - 34 .
Since the last presidential election in 2004 , " Countdown " has seen
dramatic ratings increases , up a huge 238 percent among Adults 25 - 54 and 206 percent in total viewers .
Eine vom Deutschen Instituts für Wirtschaftsforschung ( DIW ) im Auftrage der von Microsoft initiierten IT - Fitness - Initiative durchgeführte Studie kommt zu dem Schluss , dass deutschen Unternehmen durch fehlende Weiterbildung ihrer Mitarbeiter jährlich 4,5 Milliarden Euro verloren gehen .
Während der Computereinsatz in den Unternehmen in den letzten Jahren enorm zugenommen habe , sei der Kenntnisstand über die Arbeit am Computer nicht im gleichen Maße gewachsen .
75 Prozent der Produktivitätssteigerungen am Arbeitsplatz entstünden demnach durch die Informationstechnik , die jedoch durch fehlende Weiterbildung im Bereich Computer und Internet gebremst würde .
In der momentanen Krise sehen die Autoren der Studie die Chance , durch Investitionen im Personalbereich den Grundstein für künftige Wettbewerbsvorteile zu legen .
Die Initiative " IT - Fitness " wurde von Microsoft Deutschland und Partnern , darunter der Zentralverband des Deutschen Handwerks ( ZDH ) und der Netzwerkhersteller Cisco , im November 2006 ins Leben gerufen .
Ziel der Initiative ist es , die Wettbewerbsfähigkeit von Auszubildenden aus Industrie und Handwerk durch eine Optimierung ihrer IT - Kompetenz zu verbessern .
Bis zum Jahr 2010 sollen auf diesem
Wege vier Millionen Menschen in Deutschland fit für den Umgang mit Informationstechnologie im Berufsleben gemacht werden .
Die DIW - Studie soll der Öffentlichkeit morgen in voller Länge vorgestellt werden .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) -
The global financial crisis may make it easier to restrict the money supply for terrorism , but there are also risks banks could skimp on monitoring suspicious cash flows , U.S. experts said on Monday .
The authors of a new report on terrorist financing said an increased attention to financial regulation and more caution over risk in general could help identify and prevent suspect transactions .
However , hard times affecting the financial industry could also reduce budgets at banks and other institutions for monitoring and reporting , they said at a seminar on terrorist financing sponsored by the Washington Institute for Near East Policy .
“ What this financial meltdown has created is even more attention and sensitivity to risk , ” Matt Levitt , a former senior intelligence official at the U.S. Treasury Department , said “ I think it ’s going to end up being a net plus , for trying to make the international financial system more secure . ”
Levitt and Michael Jacobson , a fellow Treasury veteran and Washington Institute researcher , wrote a report for the institute that sought to counter what they called doubts over the value of cracking down on militant financing and recommended new steps to make the efforts more effective .
Jacobson noted that the September 11 attacks cost a relatively low $ 500,000 and later strikes even less .
“ As these figures keep coming out about how cheap terrorist attacks are to carry out , there is a growing skepticism about why are we even doing this , ” he said .
But the report argues that fighting terrorists through their wallets -- using measures including freezing assets of suspected terrorism financiers , tracking money flows and prosecuting individuals for material support -- remains a vital tool .
“ While there is evidence that the al Qaeda core is resurgent , funding difficulties may prevent it from growing even stronger , ” it said .
The report cited widely disseminated contribution pleas from al Qaeda leaders and public complaints of a lack of funds .
It said planned attacks were scrapped in the Philippines and elsewhere due to funding shortfalls , and finance - related intelligence helped authorities foil other planned operations , including a 2006 plot in Britain to blow up planes with liquid explosives .
The Washington Institute ’s report recommends new steps for the next U.S. president -- Barack Obama -- to make the financial war on terrorism more effective .
These include seeking more international cooperation to strengthen a strained system of terrorist blacklists , and aid to help poor countries enforce financial sanctions .
Last week , Republican vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin declared that she was willing to go to war against Russia on behalf of Georgia .
Palin was n’t talking about launching World War III on behalf of our Georgia–you know , the adorable Southern state famous for its peaches , June bugs and KKK marches–but rather for a tiny mountainous country that few Americans even knew existed before last month , and still could n’t locate on a map if their lives depended on it–even though their lives now do depend on it .
If the polls are correct , then come this January , Palin will find herself one melanoma growth away from the presidency .
So when she says she ’s ready to go to war with Russia on behalf of Georgia , we better take it seriously .
What ’s even more frightening is that Palin ’s comments were n’t some amateurish slip - up but rather the culmination of a neocon campaign to avenge Russia ’s crushing defeat of US - backed Georgian forces in August .
What the neocons and McCainites want is another war–this time one in which Russia loses .
And they have another brilliant plan to make it happen : transform picturesque little Georgia into the bloodiest hellhole on earth … and if that does n’t work , then hand the button to Palin and let her bring on The Rapture .
On August 14 , just as the Georgians and Russians signed their ceasefire , the pro-McCain neocon rag The Weekly Standard published an article “ The Pain Game : A military response to Russia ’s aggression ? ” calling for the Pentagon to refit Georgian forces to fight a protracted , Chechnya - style guerrilla war against Russia .
The author , an old cold war goon named Stuart Koehl , admitted that pushing Georgia into a Chechnya - style guerrilla struggle against Russia would result in a “ long and difficult war ” and would be “ messy , ” because the Russians “ will probably respond to this as they did to the bloodletting in both Afghanistan and Chechnya ” –in other words , by killing tens or hundreds of thousands of Georgians .
But that ’s no skin off this neocon ’s back , because if Georgia managed to hang in as long as it takes for such a war , victory over Russia could be achieved “ in a way that would not directly involve US or NATO forces . ”
In other words , Koehl and the rest of the neocons are ready to fight Russia to the last Georgian .
And that might literally mean the last Georgian , if you look at what the Russians did to Chechnya .
The idea seems to be gaining traction , as an anonymous defense analyst told a military reporter a couple of weeks ago that America should convert the Georgian armed forces into a “ Hezbollah ” guerrilla force for the same purpose–bleed the Russians into defeat , while we sit back and chant “ Hoo-ah ! ”
Lost in all of these apocalyptic plans for “ helping ” Georgia is what the Georgian people themselves might think .
How do they feel about the McCainites ’ plans for turning their ancient , charming country into one of the world ’s bloodiest hellholes –Chechnya meets South Lebanon by way of Afghanistan , according to the neocons ’ own words .
As the popular war blogger Gary Brecher explained : “ Starting a guerrilla war means sentencing most of the people in your address book to a very nasty death . ”
Do Georgians really want that ?
Last Friday , after hearing Palin say she was ready for war with Russia , I got on the phone and called some leading Georgian figures .
Right away , it became clear to me why the neocons and Sarah Palin do n’t want you to know what the Georgians think about their plans for Georgia .
“ If America goes to war against Russia , that would mean nuclear war , ” said a bewildered Alexander Rondeli , president of the Georgian Foundation for Strategic and International Studies , a think - tank closely tied to the government of President Mikheil Saakashvili .
“ As for Georgia becoming like Chechnya , Chechnya is a disaster .
What the Russians have done there is a genocide , so Chechnya is not a good scenario for us .
We Georgians want to live normally .
No , our country is not in favor of starting an insurgency . ”
Manana Kochladze , who founded Green Alternative , a leading NGO backed by the US Embassy , the European Commission and others , agreed : “ Maybe there is some crazy Georgian–like my president –who would support this , just to save his seat in power .
But this would be a disaster .
It would n’t just be about Georgia and Russia and the US , but it would be about a Third World War .
I hope your citizens understand that . ”
She added , “ I really hope that John McCain wo n’t win the elections .
We understand all the problems we have in Georgia that have come from the Republican Party . ”
In our conversation , Kochladze raised the most important issue that no one in America will talk about : Georgia ’s president , Mikheil Saakashvili ’s anti-democratic credentials .
The false spin on Saakashvili as the Jefferson of the Caucasus has driven the hysterical talk of going to war with Russia .
Maintaining this false image of Saakashvili has also been key to McCain ’s candidacy , given McCain ’s tight relationship with the controversial Georgian strongman .
Jefferson he is not .
A former senior US diplomat who served in the former Soviet Union and the Balkans told me , “ What Saakashvili has done since coming to power –controlling the television media , rigging elections , attacking opposition protesters and driving his opponents out of the country and now launching a war against an ethnic minority –I ’ve seen this before .
Saakashvili is just another Milosevic .
He ’s the kind of guy who will do anything to stay in power for life . ”
It ’s not like Saakashvili ’s authoritarian credentials are the world ’s biggest secret .
Freedom
House this year downgraded Georgia ’s freedom rating to the lower end of the “ partly free ” category , placing it on par with such beacons of democracy as Venezuela–yes , that ’s right , Hugo Chávez ’s Venezuela–and Guinea Bissau .
Georgia ’s freedom index dropped below even such basketcases as Sierra Leone and Papau New Guinea , where nearly a third of the registered voters for last year ’s heavily - criticized elections were found to have been long deceased .
What ’s more , Georgia ’s slide towards authoritarianism has only gotten worse , as Freedom House reports :
Georgia ’s political rights rating declined from 3 to 4 due to the restrictions placed on political opposition following the November 2007 emergency declaration , and the civil liberties rating declined from 3 to 4 due to the circumscription of media and expression in the aftermath of the November protests .
Georgians took to the streets to oppose President Mikheil Saakashvili in October and November 2007 , turning out in the largest numbers since the 2003 “ Rose Revolution , ” which swept Saakashvili to power .
The authorities violently dispersed the demonstrators , causing hundreds of injuries , and imposed a state of emergency on November 7 .
The next day , Saakashvili called a snap presidential election for January 5 , 2008 .
The state of emergency , which remained in place until November 16 , banned all news broadcasts except state - controlled television and restricted public assembly .
Also in 2007 , former defense minister Irakli Okruashvili , a onetime Saakashvili ally who subsequently emerged as a principal political rival , was charged with corruption , jailed , and then quickly released .
That report came out a few months ago .
Since then , things have deteriorated even further .
The OSCE ’s election monitoring arm just released a damning report about May ’s parliamentary elections .
As Reuters reported last week :
Ballot - box stuffing , beatings of opposition activists , biased news coverage and government officials campaigning for President Mikheil Saakashvili ’s party tainted Georgia ’s parliamentary elections this year , Europe ’s main election watchdog said on Tuesday .
And yet McCain , whose top foreign policy adviser , Randy Scheunemann , was paid nearly one million dollars by Saakashvili to lobby his interests , described Georgia last month as a “ tiny little democracy . ”
Saakashvili , meanwhile , bragged that he speaks to McCain “ several times a day . ”
One wonders , what do they speak about ?
Do they avoid touchy issues like the recent Reporters Without Borders report denouncing Saakashvili for stomping on the media and restricting access to the internet ?
Almost all of the Georgian TV stations support President Mikhail Saakashvili and the only opposition station , Kavkasia , is having difficulty broadcasting .
One person who knows all too well how seriously Saakashvili has undermined Georgia ’s democracy is David Usupashvili , leader of the Georgian Republican Party .
Usupashvili used to be an ally of Saakashvili ’s until his strongman tactics pushed him into opposition .
Last October , Usupashvili was in Washington meeting with government officials , warning them about Saakashvili .
Shortly after he returned to Tbilisi , Saakashvili sent his troops on protesters and declared martial law .
“ This man is very dangerous for Georgia and for the world , ” said Usapashvili , whose party is pro-American and supports Georgia ’s entry into NATO .
“ Any aid packages from the US and EU for Georgia should be accompanied by strict conditions for democratization in our country : that means opening up the electronic media to all sides , increasing the parliament ’s power [ Georgia ’s constitution gives even more power to Saakashvili than Russia gives to its president , he says ] , and organizing parliamentary elections under very close observation by the OSCE .
Unfortunately , the situation with Georgian democracy is so bad that we need the OSCE to administer the elections , just as we had to do in 2003 . ”
The Freedom House report goes further , decrying Saakashvili ’s total control over the judiciary , a brutal prison system and trafficking in women .
As Kochladze notes , Saakashvili ’s Georgia looks disturbingly similar to Vladimir Putin ’s Russia .
Even Saakashvili ’s closest allies have turned against him .
Nino Burjanadze , a major figure in Georgian politics who led the Rose Revolution with Saakashvili , quit his party this past May , criticizing his democracy credentials .
Last week , Burjanadze dropped a bombshell when she called for an investigation into how last month ’s war really started –sharply implying that Saakashvili was at least as responsible as Putin for launching the war , and letting it be known that she is considering running against her former ally .
“ I consider it very important to hold a serious investigation into what led to those events , ” Nino Burjanadze told a news conference .
“ The time to ask questions has come . ”
McCain , however , is so deep in bed with the increasingly unpopular Georgian strongman that he will do whatever it takes to keep word of Saakashvili ’s Putin - like record a big secret .
Usupashvili recounted a disturbing and revealing episode from McCain ’s famous trip to Georgia in August , 2006 , which shows just how blind–willfully or otherwise–McCain is to Saakashvili ’s authoritarian nature .
That year , Georgia ’s local elections were to be held in December .
But on the day that McCain arrived in late August , Saakashvili signed a secret presidential decree calling for local elections in forty days .
According to the Georgian election laws , the decree should be published immediately , since parties only have two days to submit their candidate list .
“ Instead , Saakashvili kept the decree in his pocket , without telling anyone , including McCain , ” said Usupashvili .
“ Saakashvili introduced McCain as ‘ the next president of the United States , ’ while McCain praised Georgian democracy .
Meanwhile , he kept the presidential decree in his pocket for two days , which is against the law .
We were only able to register our candidates at the very last second , thanks to help from people I knew in some ministries who kept the door open for us . ”
I asked Usupashvili if he ’d ever met McCain or Scheunemann ; he only indicated that he once met Scheunemann at a party .
It was clear that McCain has intentionally avoided contact with Georgia ’s pro-democracy opposition .
That ’s what one million dollars in lobbying fees will get you .
Given this spin - free account of the real Mikheil Saakashvili , what we have is one of the most absurd apocalypse scenarios imaginable : McCain and Palin are ready launch World War III and turn us all into moose burgers in order to support a Mini - Me version of Vladimir Putin against the real Vladimir Putin .
Because you know , Mini - Me is just so darned cute !
So who benefits from this ( besides Randy Scheunemann ’s client ) ?
The same old sleazy goons as always .
This year , Big Oil companies have donated three times as much money to McCain ’s campaign as they have to Obama’s .
And as for the lipstick - glossed drill - ‘n - kill pitbull , according to Carl Pope , executive director of the Sierra Club , “ No one is closer to the oil industry than Governor Palin . ”
The issue of “ conflict of interest ” takes on a new and apocalyptic meaning when you consider the role of energy giant BP in all of this .
Palin ’s husband has spent most of his adult life , eighteen years , working for BP .
The company is even more important to his wife , as BP owns Alaska ’s ( and America ’s ) largest gas and oil fields .
BP hates Russia at least as much as their tools Palin and McCain : the company has been locked in a nasty battle over its 50 percent stake in Russian energy giant TNK–BP ’s stake in that company is key to BP ’s stock price .
If BP loses TNK to Putin ’s goons , then billions could be wiped off the stock price .
That ’s something to go to war for .
Meantime , BP all but controls Georgia thanks to the Baku - Ceyhan pipeline , in which BP is the largest stakeholder .
As Manana Kochladze explained , the pipeline was supposed to bring in huge benefits to average Georgians , raising the country out of its dire economic straits .
Instead , “ very little if any of those revenues have gone to social programs or environmental protection .
Instead , the military budget has massively increased to 25 percent of the state budget .
The BP pipeline has militarized the country . ”
One provision of Georgia ’s agreement to allow the BTC pipeline to pass through its territory was that Georgia is obligated to protect and secure the pipeline–which , Georgians allege , was bombed by Russian pilots during the August conflict .
“ From the beginning , we said that Georgia would pay more defending this pipeline than we ’ve received , and now look at our situation , ” Kochladze lamented .
Another figure tied to BP is , surprise surprise , Randy Scheunemann .
He earned handsome fees lobbying for BP in 1999 - 2000 , during McCain ’s first run for President .
More recently , Scheunemann lobbied for the Caspian Alliance , which represents one of the oil majors that pumps oil into BP ’s pipeline .
From BP ’s perspective , things look very grim .
It ’s in danger of losing its largest source of booked reserves via its stake in Russia ’s TNK .
And now with the war , investors are worried about the BTC pipeline .
What better way to kill two birds with one stone than by fomenting a war that would bleed Putin ’s Russia until the regime finally collapsed –thereby securing BP ’s position in both countries .
No wonder Big Oil is throwing its weight behind the McCain - Palin ticket .
Those two understand the meaning of “ Better dead than having BP in the red . ”

Transportation Security Administration baggage screener Pythias Brown is the reason you hate flying with expensive gear in your bag , especially if you ever flew out of Newark airport .
Over the last few years , he stole at least $ 200,000 worth of electronics .
Not just a camcorder here , a laptop there , or an Xbox 360 or two , either .
No , this guy had balls .
Among his biggest hauls — literally — was an HBO employee 's $ 47,900 camera .
And the TSA was totally clueless about it .
He was finally caught after CNN found a camera he had stolen from them up for sale on eBay .
When the USPS and local police tracked him down and raided his place , they found they found 66 cameras , 31 laptops , jewelry , camera lenses , GPS devices and more .
So yeah , how does a TSA screener systematically walk out of the airport with more gadgets than Best Buy — hell , with some gear you can't even buy there — without a single agent ever noticing ?
I guess if you ever check anything actually valuable , you might want avoid Newark ( not that there are n't a million more reasons to avoid Newark ) .

The Pequot War , a 17th century conflict between English settlers and the Pequot tribe in Connecticut Colony , is the focus of a new comprehensive study by a team of UConn researchers .
Kevin McBride , associate professor of anthropology , says the war , which took place from 1636 to 1638 in southern New England , remains one of the most misinterpreted and least understood events in the history of early America .
Also working on the project re CT State Historian Walter Woodward , State Archaeologist Nick Bellantoni , and the Mashantucket Pequot Museum and Research Center .
Funded by the National Park Service American Battlefield Protection Program , the project aims to identify and preserve battlefields and historical sites associated with the Pequot War .
“ The English wanted to eliminate the powerful Pequot , ” says McBride .
“ It was the first time a policy of cultural genocide was perpetuated upon a native people in North America .
The English justified what they did through a variety of means , including vilifying the Pequot ” and portraying them as evil .
But although the English tried to wipe out the tribe , two communities survived and are known today as the Mashantucket Pequot and the Eastern Pawcatuck Pequot tribes .
Lasting for more than two years , there were several major battles and skirmishes that extended over what is now southwestern Rhode Island , coastal Connecticut , the Connecticut River Valley , northeastern Connecticut , and parts of eastern New York .

ART OF MONEY GETTING
In the United States , where we have more land than people , it is not at all difficult for persons in good health to make money .
In this comparatively new field there are so many avenues of success open , so many vocations which are not crowded , that any person of either sex who is willing , at least for the time being , to engage in any respectable occupation that offers , may find lucrative employment .
Those who really desire to attain an independence , have only to set their minds upon it , and adopt the proper means , as they do in regard to any other object which they wish to accomplish , and the thing is easily done .
But however easy it may be found to make money , I have no doubt many of my hearers will agree it is the most difficult thing in the world to keep it .
The road to wealth is , as Dr. Franklin truly says , “ as plain as the road to the mill . ”
It consists simply in expending less than we earn ; that seems to be a very simple problem .
Mr. Micawber , one of those happy creations of the genial Dickens , puts the case in a strong light when he says that to have an income of twenty pounds per annum , and spend twenty pounds and sixpence , is to be the most miserable of men ; whereas , to have an income of only twenty pounds , and spend but nineteen pounds and sixpence is to be the happiest of mortals .
Many of my readers may say , “ we understand this ; this is economy , and we know economy is wealth ; we know we can't eat our cake and keep it also . ”
Yet I beg to say that perhaps more cases of failure arise from mistakes on this point than almost any other .
The fact is , many people think they understand economy when they really do not .
True economy is misapprehended , and people go through life without properly comprehending what that principle is .
One says , “ I have an income of so much and here is my neighbor who has the same ; yet every year he gets something ahead and I fall short ; why is it ?
I know all about economy . ”
He thinks he does , but he does not .
There are many who think that economy consists in saving cheese - parings and candle - ends , in cutting off two pence from the laundress ' bill and doing all sorts of little , mean , dirty things .
Economy is not meanness .
The misfortune is , also , that this class of persons let their economy apply in only one direction .
They fancy they are so wonderfully economical in saving a half - penny where they ought to spend two pence , that they think they can afford to squander in other directions .
A few years ago , before kerosene oil was discovered or thought of , one might stop overnight at almost any farmer 's house in the agricultural districts and get a very good supper , but after supper he might attempt to read in the sitting - room , and would find it impossible with the inefficient light of one candle .
The hostess , seeing his dilemma , would say : “ It is rather difficult to read here evenings ; the proverb says ‘ you must have a ship at sea in order to be able to burn two candles at once ; ’ we never have an extra candle except on extra occasions . ”
These extra occasions occur , perhaps , twice a year .
In this way the good woman saves five , six , or ten dollars in that time ; but the information which might be derived from having the extra light would , of course , far outweigh a ton of candles .
But the trouble does not end here .
Feeling that she is so economical in tallow candles , she thinks she can afford to go frequently to the village and spend twenty or thirty dollars for ribbons and furbelows , many of which are not necessary .
This false economy may frequently be seen in men of business , and in those instances it often runs to writing - paper .
You find good business men who save all the old envelopes , and scraps , and would not tear a new sheet of paper , if they could avoid it , for the world .
This is all very well ; they may in this way save five or ten dollars a year , but being so economical ( only in note paper ) , they think they can afford to waste time ; to have expensive parties , and to drive their carriages .
This is an illustration of Dr. Franklin's “ saving at the spigot and wasting at the bung - hole ; ” “ penny wise and pound foolish . ”
Punch in speaking of this “ one idea ” class of people says “ they are like the man who bought a penny herring for his family 's dinner and then hired a coach and four to take it home . ”
I never knew a man to succeed by practising this kind of economy .
True economy consists in always making the income exceed the out - go .
Wear the old clothes a little longer if necessary ; dispense with the new pair of gloves ; mend the old dress ; live on plainer food if need be ; so that , under all circumstances , unless some unforeseen accident occurs , there will be a margin in favor of the income .
A penny here , and a dollar there , placed at interest , goes on accumulating , and in this way the desired result is attained .
It requires some training , perhaps , to accomplish this economy , but when once used to it , you will find there is more satisfaction in rational saving , than in irrational spending .
Here is a recipe which I recommend ; I have found it to work an excellent cure for extravagance , and especially for mistaken economy :
When you find that you have no surplus at the end of the year , and yet have a good income , I advise you to take a few sheets of paper and form them into a book and mark down every item of expenditure .
Post it every day or week in two columns , one headed “ necessaries ” or even “ comforts , ” and the other headed “ luxuries , ” and you will find that the latter column will be double , treble , and frequently ten times greater than the former .
The real comforts of life cost but a small portion of what most of us can earn .
Dr. Franklin says “ it is the eyes of others and not our own eyes which ruin us .
If all the world were blind except myself I should not care for fine clothes or furniture . ”
It is the fear of what Mrs. Grundy may say that keeps the noses of many worthy families to the grindstone .
In America many persons like to repeat “ we are all free and equal , ” but it is a great mistake in more senses than one .
That we are born “ free and equal ” is a glorious truth in one sense , yet we are not all born equally rich , and we never shall be .
One may say , “ there is a man who has an income of fifty thousand dollars per annum , while I have but one thousand dollars ; I knew that fellow when he was poor like myself , now he is rich and thinks he is better than I am ; I will show him that I am as good as he is ; I will go and buy a horse and buggy ; no , I can not do that , but I will go and hire one and ride this afternoon on the same road that he does , and thus prove to him that I am as good as he is . ”
My friend , you need not take that trouble ; you can easily prove that you are “ as good as he is ; ” you have only to behave as well as he does ; but you cannot make anybody believe that you are rich as he is .
Besides , if you put on these “ airs , ” and waste your time and spend your money , your poor wife will be obliged to scrub her fingers off at home , and buy her tea two ounces at a time , and everything else in proportion , in order that you may keep up “ appearances , ” and , after all , deceive nobody .
On the other hand , Mrs. Smith may say that her next - door neighbor married Johnson for his money , and “ everybody says so . ”
She has a nice one thousand dollar camel 's hair shawl , and she will make Smith get her an imitation one , and she will sit in a pew right next to her neighbor in church , in order to prove that she is her equal .
My good woman , you will not get ahead in the world , if your vanity and envy thus take the lead .
In this country , where we believe the majority ought to rule , we ignore that principle in regard to fashion , and let a handful of people , calling themselves the aristocracy , run up a false standard of perfection , and in endeavoring to rise to that standard , we constantly keep ourselves poor ; all the time digging away for the sake of outside appearances .
How much wiser to be a “ law unto ourselves ” and say , “ we will regulate our out - go by our income , and lay up something for a rainy day . ”
People ought to be as sensible on the subject of money - getting as on any other subject .
Like causes produces like effects .
You cannot accumulate a fortune by taking the road that leads to poverty .
It needs no prophet to tell us that those who live fully up to their means , without any thought of a reverse in this life , can never attain a pecuniary independence .
Men and women accustomed to gratify every whim and caprice , will find it hard , at first , to cut down their various unnecessary expenses , and will feel it a great self - denial to live in a smaller house than they have been accustomed to , with less expensive furniture , less company , less costly clothing , fewer servants , a less number of balls , parties , theater - goings , carriage - ridings , pleasure excursions , cigar - smokings , liquor - drinkings , and other extravagances ; but , after all , if they will try the plan of laying by a “ nest- egg , ” or , in other words , a small sum of money , at interest or judiciously invested in land , they will be surprised at the pleasure to be derived from constantly adding to their little “ pile , ” as well as from all the economical habits which are engendered by this course .
The old suit of clothes , and the old bonnet and dress , will answer for another season ; the Croton or spring water will taste better than champagne ; a cold bath and a brisk walk will prove more exhilarating than a ride in the finest coach ; a social chat , an evening 's reading in the family circle , or an hour 's play of “ hunt the slipper ” and “ blind man 's buff , ” will be far more pleasant than a fifty or five hundred dollar party , when the reflection on the difference in cost is indulged in by those who begin to know the pleasures of saving .
Thousands of men are kept poor , and tens of thousands are made so after they have acquired quite sufficient to support them well through life , in consequence of laying their plans of living on too broad a platform .
Some families expend twenty thousand dollars per annum , and some much more , and would scarcely know how to live on less , while others secure more solid enjoyment frequently on a twentieth part of that amount .
Prosperity is a more severe ordeal than adversity , especially sudden prosperity .
“ Easy come , easy go , ” is an old and true proverb .
A spirit of pride and vanity , when permitted to have full sway , is the undying canker - worm which gnaws the very vitals of a man 's worldly possessions , let them be small or great , hundreds or millions .
Many persons , as they begin to prosper , immediately expand their ideas and commence expending for luxuries , until in a short time their expenses swallow up their income , and they become ruined in their ridiculous attempts to keep up appearances , and make a “ sensation . ”
I know a gentleman of fortune who says , that when he first began to prosper , his wife would have a new and elegant sofa .
“ That sofa , ” he says , “ cost me thirty thousand dollars ! ”
When the sofa reached the house , it was found necessary to get chairs to match ; then side - boards , carpets and tables “ to correspond ” with them , and so on through the entire stock of furniture ; when at last it was found that the house itself was quite too small and old - fashioned for the furniture , and a new one was built to correspond with the new purchases ; “ thus , ” added my friend , “ summing up an outlay of thirty thousand dollars , caused by that single sofa , and saddling on me , in the shape of servants , equipage , and the necessary expenses attendant upon keeping up a fine ‘ establishment , ’ a yearly outlay of eleven thousand dollars , and a tight pinch at that ; whereas , ten years ago , we lived with much more real comfort , because with much less care , on as many hundreds .
The truth is , ” he continued , “ that sofa would have brought me to inevitable bankruptcy , had not a most unexampled tide of prosperity kept me above it , and had I not checked the natural desire to ‘ cut a dash . ’ ”
The foundation of success in life is good health ; that is the substratum of fortune ; it is also the basis of happiness .
A person cannot accumulate a fortune very well when he is sick .
He has no ambition ; no incentive ; no force .
Of course , there are those who have bad health and cannot help it ; you cannot expect that such persons can accumulate wealth ; but there are a great many in poor health who need not be so .
If , then , sound health is the foundation of success and happiness in life , how important it is that we should study the laws of health , which is but another expression for the laws of nature !
The closer we keep to the laws of nature , the nearer we are to good health , and yet how many persons there are who pay no attention to natural laws , but absolutely transgress them , even against their own natural inclination .
We ought to know that the “ sin of ignorance ” is never winked at in regard to the violation of nature 's laws ; their infraction always brings the penalty .
A child may thrust its finger into the flames without knowing it will burn , and so suffers , repentance , even , will not stop the smart .
Many of our ancestors knew very little about the principle of ventilation .
They did now know much about oxygen , whatever other “ gin ” they might have been acquainted with ; and consequently , they built their houses with little seven - by - nine feet bedrooms , and these good old pious Puritans would lock themselves up in one of these cells , say their prayers and go to bed .
In the morning they would devoutly return thanks for the “ preservation of their lives , ” during the night , and nobody had better reason to be thankful .
Probably some big crack in the window , or in the door , let in a little fresh air , and thus saved them .
Many persons knowingly violate the laws of nature against their better impulses , for the sake of fashion .
For instance , there is one thing that nothing living except a vile worm ever naturally loved , and that is tobacco ; yet how many persons there are who deliberately train an unnatural appetite , and overcome this implanted aversion for tobacco , to such a degree that they get to love it .
They have got hold of a poisonous , filthy weed , or rather that takes a firm hold of them .
Here are married men who run about spitting tobacco juice on the carpet and floors , and sometimes even upon their wives besides .
They do not kick their wives out of doors like drunken men , but their wives , I have no doubt , often wish they were outside of the house .
Another perilous feature is that this artificial appetite , like jealousy , “ grows by what it feeds on ; ” when you love that which is unnatural , a stronger appetite is created for the hurtful thing than the natural desire for what is harmless .
There is an old proverb which says that “ habit is second nature , ” but an artificial habit is stronger than nature .
Take for instance , an old tobacco - chewer ; his love for the “ quid ” is stronger than his love for any particular kind of food .
He can give up roast beef easier than give up the weed .
Young lads regret that they are not men ; they would like to go to bed boys and wake up men ; and to accomplish this they copy the bad habits of their seniors .
Little Tommy and Johnny see their fathers or uncles smoke a pipe , and they say , “ If I could only do that , I would be a man too ; uncle John has gone out and left his pipe of tobacco , let us try it . ”
They take a match and light it , and then puff away .
“ We will learn to smoke ; do you like it Johnny ? ”
That lad dolefully replies : “ Not very much ; it tastes bitter ; ” by and by he grows pale , but he persists and he soon offers up a sacrifice on the altar of fashion ; but the boys stick to it and persevere until at last they conquer their natural appetites and become the victims of acquired tastes .
I speak “ by the book , ” for I have noticed its effects on myself , having gone so far as to smoke ten or fifteen cigars a day , although I have not used the weed during the last fourteen years , and never shall again .
The more a man smokes , the more he craves smoking ; the last cigar smoked simply excites the desire for another , and so on incessantly .
Take the tobacco - chewer .
In the morning , when he gets up , he puts a quid in his mouth and keeps it there all day , never taking it out except to exchange it for a fresh one , or when he is going to eat ; oh ! yes , at intervals during the day and evening , many a chewer takes out the quid and holds it in his hand long enough to take a drink , and then pop it goes back again .
This simply proves that the appetite for rum is even stronger than that for tobacco .
When the tobacco - chewer goes to your country seat and you show him your grapery and fruit house , and the beauties of your garden , when you offer him some fresh , ripe fruit , and say , “ My friend , I have got here the most delicious apples , and pears , and peaches , and apricots ; I have imported them from Spain , France and Italy — just see those luscious grapes ; there is nothing more delicious nor more healthy than ripe fruit , so help yourself ; I want to see you delight yourself with these things ; ” he will roll the dear quid under his tongue and answer , “ No , I thank you , I have got tobacco in my mouth . ”
His palate has become narcotized by the noxious weed , and he has lost , in a great measure , the delicate and enviable taste for fruits .
This shows what expensive , useless and injurious habits men will get into .
I speak from experience .
I have smoked until I trembled like an aspen leaf , the blood rushed to my head , and I had a palpitation of the heart which I thought was heart disease , till I was almost killed with fright .
When I consulted my physician , he said “ break off tobacco using . ”
I was not only injuring my health and spending a great deal of money , but I was setting a bad example .
I obeyed his counsel .
No young man in the world ever looked so beautiful , as he thought he did , behind a fifteen cent cigar or a meerschaum !
These remarks apply with tenfold force to the use of intoxicating drinks .
To make money , requires a clear brain .
A man has got to see that two and two make four ; he must lay all his plans with reflection and forethought , and closely examine all the details and the ins and outs of business .
As no man can succeed in business unless he has a brain to enable him to lay his plans , and reason to guide him in their execution , so , no matter how bountifully a man may be blessed with intelligence , if the brain is muddled , and his judgment warped by intoxicating drinks , it is impossible for him to carry on business successfully .
How many good opportunities have passed , never to return , while a man was sipping a “ social glass , ” with his friend !
How many foolish bargains have been made under the influence of the “ nervine , ” which temporarily makes its victim think he is rich .
How many important chances have been put off until to - morrow , and then forever , because the wine cup has thrown the system into a state of lassitude , neutralizing the energies so essential to success in business .
Verily , “ wine is a mocker . ”
The use of intoxicating drinks as a beverage , is as much an infatuation , as is the smoking of opium by the Chinese , and the former is quite as destructive to the success of the business man as the latter .
It is an unmitigated evil , utterly indefensible in the light of philosophy , religion or good sense .
It is the parent of nearly every other evil in our country .

MOSCOW , Russia ( CNN ) --
A jet carrying 88 people crashed early Sunday morning in western Russia , killing everyone on board , an airline spokesman said .
Several foreigners were on the flight , including passport - holders from Abkhazia , Germany , France and Ukraine , said Lev Koshlyakov , spokesman for flight operator Aeroflot Nord .
Authorities are trying to confirm the presence of an American on board , Koshlyakov said .
The Boeing 737 was en route to Perm from Moscow when the pilots lost communication with air traffic control just before landing about 3:10 a.m. ( 2110 GMT ) , Koshlyakov said .
He described the weather at the time as " mediocre . "
Eighty - two passengers -- including seven children -- were on board , in addition to six crew members .
The cause of the crash was not immediately known and is under investigation , Koshlyakov said .
Rescue teams were on the scene .
Other opposition candidates have backed Mohamed Nasheed The people of the Maldives have voted in the run-off of the country 's first democratic presidential election .
Asia 's longest - serving leader , President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom , is facing former political prisoner and pro-democracy leader Mohamed Nasheed .
President Gayoom won the first round earlier this month , but failed to secure the 50 % needed for outright victory over Mr Nasheed .
Both candidates say they are confident of victory .
The BBC's Roland Buerk in Male says that a preliminary result in the vote is expected on Wednesday - but it may take up to a week before the election commission completely verifies it .
Polling has now closed .
Our correspondent says that there is an atmosphere of excitement in the cramped island capital of Male - a jumble of concrete apartment blocks - and on outlying atolls scattered across the deep blue sea .
' Big disparity '
The campaigning was noisy with rallies late into Sunday night and parades of trucks and taxis in the narrow streets of Male as the people of the Maldives enjoyed what for them is a new experience .
Opposition candidates who were knocked out are now supporting Mr Nasheed , known as Anni .
" There is a very big disparity between the rich and the poor , the gap is very , very wide .
There is a very big housing shortage .
There 's an acute drug problem .
Inflation is rampant , " he told the BBC .
" This form of government has reached its capacity in delivering .
We really need to change .
This is a very rich country .
We have a lot of natural resources .
Fish is abundant .
Tourism is excellent .
So we should be able to have a better life here . "
President Gayoom has ruled the Maldives since 1978 and claims credit for making the country South Asia 's most prosperous , largely thanks to tourists who come for the white sandy beaches and turquoise lagoons .
He began a reform programme following international criticism of his suppression of street protests in 2004 .
Reasons to win
This is the first time President Gayoom has allowed competition in an election .
Mohamed Nasheed has said he is a dictator and a has - been sultan , and that the Maldives needs change .
President Gayoom hopes a win will vindicate his years in power
When asked how it felt , to be standing , potentially , on the brink of power after years spent in the pro-democracy struggle , Mr Nasheed said it was " heart lifting " , especially after he had been tortured twice and spent numerous days in solitary confinement .
But President Gayoom remains confident of victory too .
" I need five more years for one thing to complete my reform agenda .
I want it to be my legacy to the country that the country enjoys a full democratic system , " he said while campaigning in the far north of the archipelago .
Both men going into this election have deep personal reasons for wanting to win .
Our correspondent says that winning the presidency of the Maldives would be the culmination of Mohamed Nasheed 's long campaign for democracy .
For President Gayoom victory would be a vindication of his decades in power .

What are these ?
President Chavez says the vote is vital to his social spending programmes Venezuelans have voted in elections to choose new state governors and more than 300 mayors across the country .
The polls are being seen as a critical test for President Hugo Chavez , whose allies won in all but two of the country 's 23 states in 2004 .
Such a margin of victory is unlikely this time , correspondents say .
Last year Mr Chavez suffered his first electoral defeat in almost 10 years , losing a referendum that would have let presidents seek indefinite re-election .
The opposition is looking to build on that victory .
Mr Chavez enjoys popular support for spending oil wealth on schools , clinics and subsidised food , but needs a resounding win to silence his critics , says the BBC's Will Grant in Caracas .
His government 's failure to control crime and inflation are voters ' main concerns .
The gloomy outlook for the price of oil - which makes up more than 50 % of government income - is also causing concern , while the country has one of the world 's highest murder rates and the continent 's worst inflation .
Opinion polls suggest Mr Chavez ' United Socialist Party of Venezuela ( PSUV ) is likely to hold most states and cities , but may lose some posts as voters also express concern over corruption and inefficiency .
' Punch in the stomach '
Our correspondent says long queues formed outside polling stations across the country as voting took place in 22 states .
An estimated 140,000 troops were deployed to maintain security , and some 130 international election observers were on hand to help ensure the vote was free and fair .
KEY ELECTION BATTLEGROUNDS
Caracas : Chavez supporter Aristobulo Isturiz against anti-Chavez politician Antonio Ledezma Zulia state : currently governed by Chavez rival Manuel Rosales Miranda state : current governor Chavez aide Diosdado Cabello up for re-election Barinas state : President Chavez 's home state .
His father , the current governor , is stepping down .
His brother Adan standing for the governorship but faces tough election battle
Local elections test Chavez support Polls closed at 1625 ( 2055 GMT ) but voters already in line were allowed to cast their ballots .
Analysts on both sides of the political divide say opposition candidates or so - called left - wing " dissidents " , opposed to Mr Chavez , may win in a number of states .
Among them are the oil - rich state of Zulia , on the border with Colombia , and the states of Carabobo and Sucre .
Even the president 's home state of Barinas - where his brother is the socialist candidate - is in doubt , prompting Mr Chavez to remark that losing in Barinas would be like a " punch in the stomach " .
Many people will also be watching the tight battle for the powerful position of Mayor of Caracas .
President Chavez has told voters that a win for what he calls " his candidates " is vital for the future of his popular social spending programmes .
The opposition has tried to counter this by stressing that the vote is not about national projects but local municipalities , in particular the growing problem of civil insecurity and crime .
About 17 million Venezuelans were eligible to vote for 22 governors , 328 mayors and 233 heads of regional councils for four - year terms .

CEPR Statement for the Next Administration
Prices of flat panels have been dropping quite steadily ever since they first came to market , but apparently , they could ’ve dropped a whole lot lower if it was n’t for those pesky flat panel manufacturers .
Three flat panel makers , LG Display , Sharp , and Chunghwa Picture Tubes ( tubes … ? ) have pleaded guilty to engaging in price fixing schemes to the US Department of Justice , and agreed to a shared USD 585 million fine .
Flat panels are being used in almost every device these days , from water boilers to refridgerators , and usually , they constitute a large part of a computer ’s or laptop ’s total price .
“ In the last six months alone , the price of a 15.4 - inch panel for a notebook PC has dropped to USD 63 , from USD 97 , and a 32 - inch LCD for a television has gone to USD 223 , from USD 321 , according to iSuppli , a market research firm , ” The New York Times claims .
As most of us remember the day when we first opened that box for a 15 ″ 1024×768 LCD panel for our desktops , we will also feel the pain in our chest where the salesman took out our rib .
The case is not over with the fine , however .
The three manufacturers have agreed to cooperate with the US Department of Justice to further the investigation , which is being conducted together with governments in the EU and Asia .
The US DOJ states that among other companies , Dell , Apple , and Motorola were negatively affected by the price fixing scheme .
They might have a base for a private suit against the three panel makers .
Ask the experts , and they ’ll say the current financial crisis was a long time in coming .
It started with the subprime mortgage crisis , when lenders routinely issued variable - rate mortgages to homeowners without confirming their ability to pay .
When interest rates rose and homeowners defaulted on their mortgages in record numbers , it had profound effects not only in the American mortgage market but also in the wider financial world .
In a simplified explanation , the mortgage meltdown was the root cause of the financial crisis .
But the truth is more complex .
In reality , a combination of increased housing speculation leading to a housing bubble , high - risk lending practices , lax government regulation , the failures of several large lending firms as a result of risky lending , and a variety of other factors coincided in September of 2008 to cause a drastic drop in the stock market and forced many key financial institutions to their knees .
The government responded by passing a $ 700 billion bailout bill intended to save financial institutions and keep the economy moving .

Trouble for Parents and College Students
It still too early to tell how the bailout will really impact the financial situation long term .
In meantime students should be cautious about taking on any more debt and seeking the best terms for any college loans .
Parents and students have already seen the effects of the stock market crash in their college savings accounts .
Many parents invested in 529 plans that allowed them to accumulate tax - deductible savings and invest the funds in a mixture of stocks and bonds to promote growth .
Depending on how aggressively the funds were invested , many college savings accounts were drastically damaged in September ’s stock market crash .
This has a profound effect on students — from limiting their college choices to greatly increasing their debt burden after college .
After the trouble caused by risky lending practices in the past , lenders are tightening requirements for new loans .
Many students and recent graduates have large amounts of college debt and no credit record , making it difficult for them to secure loans in a more tightly restrictive environment .
The bailout money may make lenders a little more willing to offer loans to students — but it still wo n’t be as easy to secure funding as it was in decades past .
Initial Warning Signs
The larger financial meltdown was exacerbated by the downfall of the commercial paper market .
The commercial paper market provides a way for companies to borrow from one another to secure cash quickly for big initiatives — to build a new factory , start new product research , or fund the purchase of new equipment , for example .
Established companies often issue commercial paper to other companies because they have the cash and can profit from the interest .
All companies benefit , because borrowing in this way is less costly than borrowing from a bank .
In September , however , the market crashed to a halt .
In the wider economy , this could be catastrophic — it means that no company would be able to advance unless it had accumulated the capital to do so .
If a large company wants to open a new store , for example , it will have to wait years to accumulate the funds to do it rather than borrowing to do it sooner .
This affects economic progress , and it also affects jobs — new jobs wo n’t be produced as quickly , and companies will cut back on payroll to save for necessary investments .
Potentially , the commercial paper crash could boost unemployment to catastrophic rates .
What the Bailout will " Hopefully " Accomplish
Part of the bailout is aimed at the commercial paper market , and it ’s intended to alleviate these problems .
If it goes according to plan , a major drop in employment will be avoided .
The job market is still tough for recent grads , but the bailout will hopefully keep it from getting significantly worse .
It ’s still a bit early to tell how the bailout will affect students in the long run .
Hopefully , it will keep the economic crisis from getting worse than it is — and lay the foundation for future prosperity .
As a potential student , your best bet is to avoid accumulating debt as much as possible — especially expensive private debt .
Look into ways to pay off your debt while in college , and you may be able to come out ahead when you graduate — no matter the economic situation .
