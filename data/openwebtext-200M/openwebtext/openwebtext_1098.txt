Your brain is like a pile of sand , but do n’t worry : that ’s why it has such remarkable powers ( Image : Phanie Agency / Rex Features )
HAVE you ever experienced that eerie feeling of a thought popping into your head as if from nowhere , with no clue as to why you had that particular idea at that particular time ?
You may think that such fleeting thoughts , however random they seem , must be the product of predictable and rational processes .
After all , the brain cannot be random , can it ?
Surely it processes information using ordered , logical operations , like a powerful computer ?
Actually , no .
In reality , your brain operates on the edge of chaos .
Though much of the time it runs in an orderly and stable way , every now and again it suddenly and unpredictably lurches into a blizzard of noise .
Neuroscientists have long suspected as much .
Only recently , however , have they come up with proof that brains work this way .
Now they are trying to work out why .
Some believe that near - chaotic states may be crucial to memory , and could explain why some people are smarter than others .
In technical terms , systems on the edge of chaos are said to be in a state of “ self - organised criticality ” .
These systems are right on the boundary between stable , orderly behaviour – such as a swinging pendulum – and the unpredictable world of chaos , as exemplified by turbulence .
The quintessential example of self - organised criticality is a growing sand pile .
As grains build up , the pile grows in a predictable way until , suddenly and without warning , it hits a critical point and collapses .

I 'm outraged that the Obama administration is supporting the RIAA on the case against Jammie Thomas , a single mother of four who has to pay them $ 1.92 million for downloading songs .
That 's more expensive than murder and six other crimes :

• Child abduction : Fine of $ 25,000 and up to three years in prison , which can be accounted as $ 50,233 per year ( that was the median household income in 2007 , probably down because of the economic crisis ) .
Total : $ 175,699 .
• Steal the CDs : A total of $ 275,000 , $ 52,500 fine for the CDs .
• Steal a lawnmower from your neighbour : A total of $ 375,000 .
• Burn someone 's house while playing The Doors : Another $ 375,000 .
• Stalk a Gizmodo editor ( yes , you know who you are ) : A Class 4 felony that will result in just $ 175,000 .

• Start a dogfighting ring : $ 50,000 .
• Murder someone on the second degree , a Class 1 felony : $ 778,495 , which accounts for a $ 25,000 fine and four to 15 years in prison .
Heck , you can do all these crimes , and the total amount will be only $ 2.2 million .
Of course , you can't really quantify years spent in prison using dollars , but I do n't care .
The case of Jammie — and many like hers — is still absolutely outrageous .
Ms. Thomas got fined $ 1.92 million for downloading 1700 songs songs .
For some reason , a popular jury thought that was fair .
That 's ok .
There are mentally disturbed people everywhere .
But I do n't care if it 's 1700 or 17000 songs , nobody can be punished like this for downloading songs .
It may follow a draconian law to the last comma and period , but that does n't make the verdict just .
The law is what is at fault here , with a punishment that is not proportional to the magnitude of the " crime . "
This goes against the most basic sense of justice .

I know that el Señor Presidente has more serious issues to worry about that this case , but something needs to be done about it .
Something drastic .
Unfortunately , nothing will happen , given the " class " of people now at the Department of Justice :

Mr. Munroe said he had been contacted by large publishers , particularly those that specialize in comics and graphic novels .
“ The traditional model is they send us a royalty , and they handle getting it sold , ” he said .
“ We figure that most of our audience is people who know us from the Internet  normal publishers were n’t as interested . ”
Image Credit ... xkcd.com
Naturally , without an established publisher and with a devoted fan base online , the book will not be promoted through traditional publicity .
Rather , the plan is to rely on word - of - keyboard .
Such online recommendations , Mr. Ohanian said , were how he discovered xkcd .
“ The first time xkcd showed up on reddit  it was just good , ” he said .
“ The Internet really facilitates good stuff being read . ”
Will there be review copies sent to newspapers and magazines ?
Good question , Mr. Ohanian said .
There ’s no reason why not , he quickly concluded .
While Mr. Munroe conceded a nostalgic love of books , remembering how he devoured books of a favorite comic strip , Calvin & Hobbes , he said he is now a committed Kindle 2 user , preferring it to print .
Still , he said : “ I have this urge .
You want to print them out and put them up on places .
There is something good about collecting them together . ”
Publishing a book is an extension of the selling of items like T - shirts and posters , which pays the bills , he said , to a “ free culture ” mind - set about the cartoons themselves .
“ We have been encouraging people to share things , saying that it is a good business decision , ” he said .
“ Instead of trying to convince people , why not make a bunch of money ? ”
The book will have 150 to 200 of strips out of more than 500 so far published online and is expected to sell for $ 19 .
The selection was made by a fan who is also doing the layout for breadpig .
“ I took a few off and added a few others , ” he said .
MacUser provides an in - depth look at one useful new feature in Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard : Wake On Demand .
[ Wake On Demand ] is Apple 's name for a new networking feature that lets a Snow Leopard Mac go to sleep while a networked base station continues to broadcast Bonjour messages about the services the sleeping computer offers .
The base station essentially acts as a proxy for the slumbering Mac. Advertised Bonjour services includes file sharing , screen sharing , iTunes library sharing , and printer sharing among others .
Prior to Snow Leopard , you would have to make your Mac never go to sleep if you wanted it to provide file or print sharing services at any time .
This new feature will wake your Mac over Ethernet or even Wi -Fi networks .
There is a specific combination of hardware that is required to accomplish these tasks , however .
Apple says you need an AirPort Extreme Base Station ( 2007 or more recent ) or Time Capsule ( 2008 or more recent ) with the latest firmware .
MacUser found that in order to wake your Mac by Wi-Fi alone , you would need a 2009 Mac .
To see if your Mac supports this ' Wake on Wireless ' option , you can look at your System Profiler .
Apple details how this could be used to offer full - time support for iTunes Sharing , Printer Sharing , Back to My Mac , and more .
Mac OS X 10.6 Snow Leopard was officially launched today .
Update : Readers are finding the requirements are less strict than thought .
There has been success with older Macs for the Wireless Wake feature and the use of an Airport Express .
Update 2 : To clear up some confusion surrounding the Wake on Demand feature , readers should note that computers running earlier Mac OS X versions and connected via Ethernet can be awakened remotely using such third - party utilities as WakeOnLan , but Snow Leopard builds that functionality into the operating system and extends that ability to computers connected via Wi -Fi .
While the simple " Wake on Wireless " functionality appears to be available with any wireless router for compatible machines running Snow Leopard and can be triggered using utilities such as WakeOnLan , the Bonjour Sleep Proxy feature needed for the advanced functionalities of broadcasting information about the sleeping machine requires the use of an Apple AirPort or Time Capsule base station running firmware 7.4.2 or later .

Poland currently has some 2,000 troops serving in Afghanistan
The head of the Polish army has resigned after a dispute in which he accused the government of failing to properly equip troops in Afghanistan .
Lt Gen Waldemar Skrzypczak also said ministry officials ' knowledge of war was limited to the movies .
He made his comments after the death of a Polish officer earlier this month in an ambush in Afghanistan .
Poland has 2,000 troops in the country as part of the Nato - led International Security Assistance Force .
The dispute involving Gen Skrzypczak became public following this month 's battle between Polish troops and insurgents .
Four soldiers were wounded in the clash .
Initial inquiries found that the unit had not received prompt back - up owing to equipment shortages .
Gen Skrzypczak publicly accused the defence ministry of incompetence and failing to provide his troops with modern helicopters and other military hardware .
He resigned after the defence minister , Bogdan Klich , told a news conference that the general had admitted his criticisms were a mistake .
Gen Skrzypczak said he stood by his remarks .
He said his only mistake was to go public as the body of the dead officer was being flown home .
October is National Kitchen & Bath Month , and this year , homeowners have a great reason to celebrate .
Inspired by the success of the " Cash for Clunkers " program , the U.S. Department of Energy will launch a " Cash for Appliances " program this fall .
The program will provide nearly $ 300 million in stimulus funds from the American Recovery and Reinvestment
Act to consumers who buy new , energy - efficient kitchen appliances .
" These rebates will help families make the transition to more efficient appliances , making purchases that will directly stimulate the economy and create jobs , " Energy Secretary Steven Chu says .
This new rebate program is in addition to a number of U.S. tax credits on energy - efficient products for homes introduced earlier this year .
This includes many gas , oil , electric and solar water heaters , which are reimbursed at 30 percent of their purchase price up to $ 1,500 .
Many energy - efficient windows , skylights , exterior doors , insulation and HVAC systems are also eligible for a 30 percent tax credit , up to $ 1,500 per home .
( This $ 1,500 limit is the total for all credits applied to the home across all categories of eligible products ) .

Overall changes in food imports , production and availability
Average tariffs in Central America declined from 45 % in 1985 to around 6 % in 2000 .
In line with this , total food imports into the Central American countries more than doubled between 1990 / 92–2003/05 from 4.5 to 9.6 million tonnes [ 19 ] .
Honduras and Costa Rica registered the highest rates of growth , followed by Guatemala and El Salvador ( Figure 1 , Table 1 ) .
Food imports into Central America from the United States alone almost tripled since 1990 [ 17 ] .

Note : " Food " includes animal meat ( bovine , swine , sheep , poultry ) ; fish ; animal products ( e.g. dairy products , eggs ) ; vegetables ; fruit ; cereal grains ; flours ; raw nuts & seeds ; fats & oils ( some appear to be for industrial use , but are not split out for this spreadsheet ) ; processed meats ; sugar ; cocoa beans & derivatives ; cereal foods ( processed ) ; preserved foods ( esp. vegetables ) ; food preparations ; non-alcoholic beverages .
It excludes : live animals ; inedible animal products ( e.g. hair ) ; plants , cut flowers etc ; coffee , tea , spices ; seeds definitely for planting etc ; gums & saps ; vegetable material ( inedible ) ; vegetable waxes & residues ; alcohol & alcoholic drinks .

Between 1990 and 2005 , the increase in the amount of food imported was relatively greater than the increase in production , indicating that imports became a more important source of foods consumed in the region ( Table 1 ) .
Food available for consumption increased by less than the combined increase of production and imports , reflecting the fact that a greater proportion of the food supply is exported ( 90 % increase between 1990 and 2005 ) or used as animal feed ( 75 % increase ) .
While these trends reflect the overall situation in Central America , there is a great deal of variation between the different food groups and countries , which are discussed below in relation to changing trade policies in the region .
Staple grains
The United States is the leading source of imports of the three major grains , corn , rice , and wheat , into Central America .
By volume , these grains comprise over 80 % of all food imported from the United States [ 17 ] , and imports have grown significantly since 1990 , particularly of rice ( Table 2 ) .
Table 2 Imports of the three major grains into Central America from the United States , 1990/91 and 2005/06 Full size table
As rice imports have increased , domestic production has declined .
However , the rise in imports has been greater than the decline of production , resulting in a greater overall level of supply , with rice availability increasing in all countries ( Figure 2 ) .
In 1990 , 39 % of rice available for consumption in Central America was imported ; the figure now stands at 69 % .
Over 90 % of these imports are of rough rice ( which needs to be milled before consumption ) .
Figure 2 Production , imports and consumption of rice in Central America , 1990 – 2005 .
Source [ 15 ] .
Full size image
Since rice is an important crop for domestic producers , it has historically been subject to high levels of protection and high tariffs remain in place ( 30–60 % ) .
Nevertheless trade policies for rough rice have been liberalized through alternate means : the removal of import licensing systems , the elimination of price banding mechanisms , the introduction of tariff - rate quotas , and the relaxation of phytosanitary requirements .
These new trade policies have had a clear impact on imports .
In Honduras , for example , the replacement of the system of import licensing and administrative permits by a quota system in 1994 and relaxation of phytosanitary restrictions in 1997 were followed by a steady increase of rice imports [ 20 – 22 ] .
In 1999 , the government lowered the import tariff to 1 % , further stimulating imports .
In contrast , Nicaragua has had the smallest increase of rice imports in the region .
Again , this reflects trade policies .
In 1992 , the government implemented a price band mechanism for rice , which directly restricted rice imports from the US and since then policies have remained restrictive .
Notably , as a means of protecting the local rice milling industry – and in response to extensive lobbying by this industry – the market for milled rice has hardly been liberalized at all and imports have remained extremely low .
Trade policies have , then , facilitated greater availability of rice in the region , but with variation between countries due to policy differences .
The situation for corn is a little more complex because there are two types of corn : yellow ( animal feed ) and white ( human consumption ) .
While corn imports into Central America have increased , this is overwhelmingly the result of increasing imports of yellow corn for animal feed ( discussed in the next section ) ( Table 2 ) .
Imports of staple grain used for human consumption , white corn , remain limited due to high import barriers in place designed to protect domestic producers .
These barriers continue under CAFTA implementation .
Meat and animal feed
The United States is the leading exporter of meat into Central America , and since 1990 , meat exports have grown significantly ( Figure 3 ) .
This largely reflects increasing exports of poultry and pork : poultry imports into Central America increased from 22 % to 71 % of total meat imports between 1990 and 2006 , and pork imports from 6 – 18 % ( previously , imports were dominated by offal and preserved meat ) ( Figure 3 ) .
The steep increase of poultry imports is largely due to frozen poultry cuts , which now form 30 % of all meat imports from the United States .
Eighty - eight percent of these cuts are frozen chicken leg quarters , a by - product of chicken breast production in the United States [ 23 ] .
Figure 3 Meat imports from the United States into Central America , 1989 –2006 .

Full size image
Guatemala receives 90 % of all poultry imported from the United States [ 17 ] , and 58 % of all chicken imports into the region [ 19 ] .
In 2005 , imported poultry from the United States represented approximately 30 % of local consumption in Guatemala [ 24 ] .
Imports of frozen chicken leg quarters into Guatemala grew particularly fast after 1997 , a change that reflects the liberalization of trade policy , which progressed after the signing of the Peace Accords in 1996 [ 25 ] .
Up until to 1997 ( from at least 1995 ) , there was a 3600 MT / year quota with a 20 % in - quota tariff and 50 % out - of - quota tariff , which created a strong disincentive to exporters [ 26 ] .
However , in October 1996 , the government announced a new poultry import policy that doubled the annual TRQ , and reduced the in-quota tariff to 15 % [ 27 ] .
Imports started to rise immediately ( Figure 4 ) .
Reinforcing this policy , the TRQ was increased to 39,452 MT in 2005 with an in -quota applied tariff of 5 % .
According to analysis by the USDA " This greatly stimulated U.S. exports , and by 2005 poultry exports reached the highest value ever reported ( $ 44.8 million ) " [ 28 ] .
As a result of the policy changes , " the growth in consumption is likely to have been picked up by US imports , leaving insignificant production growth " [ 29 ] .

Rising chicken imports into Guatemala have had a discernible impact on total chicken availability in the region ( Figure 5 ) .
Reflecting much more restrictive import policies , imports into other countries have increased by a smaller amount .
However , the limited import liberalization that did occur in the other Central American countries also boosted imports .
For example , for most of the 1990s , Honduras implemented a 100 % tariff on poultry meat and phytosanitary requirements restricted imports .
In 1999 , Honduras ' tariff binding for poultry meat declined to 50 % , and the country loosened its zoosanitary import requirements for poultry in an effort to comply with its WTO commitments [ 30 , 31 ] .
Subsequently , poultry imports have increased by 20 % per year and Honduras has emerged as the second largest chicken importer in the region [ 32 ] .

* The graph includes all chicken imports into the region , but the change since 1997 reflects imports from the United States .
Full size image
Trade liberalization policies in Central America have clearly had an impact on chicken availability .
However , the vast majority of increasing availability has been a result of increased domestic production ( Figure 5 ) .
Yet this , too , partly reflects the impact of trade liberalization , since trade policies have stimulated the import of one of the major inputs into chicken production : yellow corn .
Imports of yellow corn into Central America from the United States increased by 283 % between 1990 and 2006 .
During the same time period , most countries implemented limited but consistent measures to open up their market for yellow corn .
In 1997 , Guatemala , the leading corn importer in the region , opened up the TRQ for yellow corn imports , at a 5 % in - tariff quota and a 55 % out - of - quota tariff [ 33 ] .
The quota was subsequently increased , reaching 100,000 MT by 2000 [ 34 ] and 501,820 MT in 2001 ( 5 % in - tariff quota and out - of - quota tariff of 35 % ) [ 35 ] .
The result has been increased availability of yellow corn for animal feed in the region ( Figure 6 ) .
The increase cannot be explained by rising domestic production , since this is almost exclusively of white corn for human consumption .
It is worth pointing out that the main user of yellow corn , the poultry sector , lobbied strongly for declines on import barriers for yellow corn .
The reduction in the tariff on yellow corn implemented in El Salvador in 1995 was , for example , " mostly a result of pressure brought to bear on the government by poultry producers " [ 36 ] .

Dairy
In contrast to other commodities , the United States is not the leading dairy exporter into Central America : Europe and Australasia are important exporters , and there is considerable intra-regional trade .
But between 1990/91 and 2004 /06 , imports of dairy products from the United States into Central America increased by 949 % , and the United States became the leading exporter of two products : processed cheese and whey .
Between 1990/91 and 2004 /06 , imports of processed cheese – such as cheese slices , sold in supermarkets and used by fast food outlets [ 37 ] – rose 3215 % to comprise 37 % of all cheese imports from the US [ 17 ] .
It is notable that the two leading importers of processed cheese , Guatemala and Honduras , had significantly lower tariffs than the other countries : less than 20 % compared with 35 – 66 % in 2003 [ 38 ] .
That these relatively high tariffs have clearly not been completely prohibitive , is likely to be because processed cheeses are predominantly sold to the fast food industry , or wealthier consumers able to afford higher prices in supermarkets .
The second product in which the United States dominates is whey – the liquid byproduct of cheese production – which formed 24.4 % of all dairy product imports in 2004 / 06 , an increase of 719 % since 1989 / 91 .
The United States is the leading producer and exporter of whey in the world [ 39 ] .
Whey and its derivatives are used in animal feed , pet foods , and as an ingredient in many processed foods [ 40 ] .
The increase in imports is unlikely to have been directly affected by changing trade policies , since tariffs on whey in Central America have been consistently low ; in 2003 , tariffs were 0 – 1 % for all countries [ 38 ] .
Rather , increased imports reflect increased demand from the growing food processing industry in the region and extensive marketing by US whey exporters , with imports responding in the absence of trade barriers .
Fresh and processed fruits and vegetables ( including potatoes )
Imports of fresh fruits and processed fruits and vegetables from all countries into Central America have risen significantly since 1990 , while imports of fresh vegetables have declined .
Fresh fruit imports are largely ( 77 % ) of apples and grapes , of which the United States , alongside Chile , is the leading source of imports [ 18 ] .
Although apples and grapes make up just 5 % of total fruit consumption in the region , that they are consumed at all is a direct result of imports , since domestic production is low ( Figure 7 ) .
In turn , increased imports have been associated with reduced trade barriers .
Imports of apples into the regions ' largest importing country , Guatemala , began to rise steeply in 1996 , coinciding directly with the liberalization of the import market for apples through implementation of a TRQ and reduced in - quota tariff ( 12 % ) .
The new policy also eliminated the import licensing requirement for apples and allowed apple imports all year round [ 41 ] .
Imports in 1996 filled the set quota ; subsequent increases in imports reflect the higher TRQ of 10,000 – 15,000 MT set the following year [ 42 ] .

With regard to processed products , the most significant trend is the rise of imports of French fries , particularly post -2000 ( Figure 8 ) .
French fries formed 23 % of all imports of fruits and vegetables in 2004 / 06 .
The amount imported varies between countries : Guatemala led with 35 % in 2006 , compared to Costa Rica at 5 % .
The United States and Canada are the leading exporters of frozen potatoes to the region [ 18 ] .
Figure 8 Imports of french fries ( frozen ) into the Central American countries from the United States .
Source [ 16 ] .
Full size image
There are no data on availability of French fries in Central America , but if information from Costa Rica is illustrative , it is likely that all frozen French fries are imported , since domestic producers do not grow the specific type of potato required by the industry [ 43 ] .
Thus imports are 100 % responsible for availability .
Sales of frozen French fries are largely to fast food outlets , restaurants and hotels .
In Costa Rica , 75 % of all frozen French fries enter this market , with the remaining 25 % being sold by supermarkets [ 43 ] .
In Guatemala , sales from supermarkets are apparently negligible , so it is likely that all imports are sold by the food service industry [ 37 , 44 ] .
Tariffs on frozen French fries are not particularly high for four of the countries - 15 % – but it is notable that the country with the lowest amount of imports , Costa Rica , has a tariff of 41 % .
While imports into Costa Rica rose during the 1990s , fuelled by demand from fast food restaurants and the tourism industry , in the 2000s , imports from Canada grew rapidly to the detriment of other importers ( Table 3 ) .
This was the direct result of policies arising from the Canadian - Costa Rica trade agreement , implemented in 2003 .
In the agreement , Costa Rica implemented a TRQ with a zero in - quota tariff for imports of Canadian French fries , with the 41 % out - of - quota tariff phased out over eight years .
Table 3 Export Volume of Frozen French Fries to Costa Rica ( 2001 –2005 ) ( Metric Tons )

No information could be obtained about trade policies specific to frozen French fries for the other countries .
It is likely that increased imports stems from increased demand from the spread of the fast food industry in the region and the lack of a punitive tariff [ 45 ] .
Snacks
Snacks are defined by the USDA FAS data system as chocolate confectionary , sugar confectionary , chewing gum , cookies and pastries ( sweet snacks ) and popcorn , potato chips and other chips ( savoury snacks ) .
Imports of all snacks into Central America – as well as intra-regional trade – increased during the 1990s ( Figure 9 ) .
Figure 9 Pastry , biscuit and confectionary imports into Central America , 1990 – 2004 .

Full size image
Specifically , imports of chocolate , candy , cookies and pastries and popcorn from the United States into Central America grew in the early 1990s , and of potato and other chips in the late 1990s ( Figure 10 ) .
As of 2006 , the largest snack categories imported by weight were confectionary ( chewing gum , sugar - based candy and chocolate ) and popcorn .
Figure 10 Snack imports from the United States into Central America , 1989 –2006 .

Full size image
There are no data on total availability of snacks in the countries , but expenditure data in two of the largest importing countries , Costa Rica and Guatemala , suggests that consumption is rising .
In these two countries , sales of chips , popcorn , chocolate , confectionary and cookies all show a markedly increasing trend [ 37 , 44 ] .
Tariffs on snacks into Central America are not notably high – all are under 20 % with the exception of potato chips into Costa Rica , which faced a 41 % tariff in 2003 [ 38 ] .
Specific trade policy changes affecting snacks could not be identified from the available literature but trade barriers were reduced across the board in many Central American countries during the 1990s [ 46 ] .
In addition , the growth of large supermarkets in the region – itself encouraged through the liberalization of investment policies – is likely to have increased the incentives for manufacturers to export into the region , particularly for commodities with low trade barriers [ 47 – 49 ] .
Many of these supermarkets have established relationships with American processed food suppliers , and because of their size , capital base , economies of scale in storage and distribution and technological advancements in supply logistics , are able to make available a far wider range of snack foods relative to small stores [ 4 ] .
It is also noteworthy that during the 1990s , the growth in processed food sales by US affiliates in Guatemala and Costa Rica significantly outstripped growth in sales of US exports [ 50 ] .
Indeed , much of the market for chips in Guatemala is dominated by U.S. companies which have invested in the region .
In 2005 , PepsiCo had a 60 % share of the market for sweet and savoury snacks [ 44 ] .
US companies ( Kraft , Mars , Hershey ) also dominate the market for chocolate confectionary in both Costa Rica and Guatemala [ 37 , 44 ]
This suggests that much of the market for snack foods from the United States is the result of foreign direct investment ( FDI ) into Central America by the food industry , rather than direct exports .
American companies do , however , face significant domestic competition from leading snack food companies like Diana in El Salvador and Señorial in Guatemala .
In cookies , for example , local companies have a greater market share than the U.S. - based Nabisco [ 44 ] .
Ecological niche models ( ENMs ) and species distribution models have become increasingly popular tools for predicting the geographic ranges of species and have been important for conservation ( Kremen et al. , 2007 ) , for predicting changes in distribution from past or future climatic events ( Hijmans & Graham , 2006 ) , and for investigating patterns of speciation and niche divergence ( Wiens & Graham , 2005 ; Carstens & Richards , 2007 ; Warren et al. , 2008 ) .
The basic premise of the ENM approach is to predict the occurrence of species on a landscape from georeferenced site locality data and sets of spatially explicit environmental data layers that are assumed to correlate with the species ’ range .
In many cases , models are based on researchers ’ own collection data and on detailed knowledge of the taxa being studied , making predictions reasonable depictions of species occurrences given the current modelling technology .
However , the increasing availability of locality data in online literature , museum databases and online data portals [ e.g. GBIF ( http://data.gbif.org/)] is providing unprecedented access to biodiversity data and allowing researchers to greatly expand the deployment of species distribution models and / or ENMs .
While the value of publicly available sample locality data is not questioned , the consequent introduction of errors in the accuracy of specimen identity and georeferencing could be problematic for developing ENMs from public data sources ( Graham et al. , 2004 ; Soberón & Peterson , 2004 ) .
Although georeferencing inaccuracies can be identified in databases from qualitative or quantitative accuracy thresholds ( e.g. http://manisnet.org/GeorefGuide.html), poor taxonomy and / or misidentification may be less detectable .
This issue may be particularly problematic , for example , with cryptic species or subspecies that are morphologically similar but may have very distinct ecological requirements and geographic distributions , or for those data sources that contain indirect observations rather than references only to physical specimens .
In our own attempts at implementing ENMs we have encountered probable misidentifications in biodiversity records for a number of species , and expect that many researchers have had similar issues .
To demonstrate the potential for generating dubious yet visually convincing distributions from publicly available data we use ENMs to predict the range not of misidentified cryptic species , but of a crypto‐zoological species – the North American Sasquatch , or Bigfoot .
Supposedly , Sasquatch belongs to a large primate lineage descended from the extinct Asian species Gigantopithicus blacki , but see Milinkovich et al. ( 2004 ) and Coltman & Davis ( 2005 ) for phylogenetic analyses indicating possible membership in the ungulate clade .
Sasquatch is regularly reported in forested lands of western North America , as well as being considered a significant indigenous American and western North American folk legend ( Meldrum , 2007 ) , however the existence of this creature has never been verified with a typed specimen .
We present ENMs for Bigfoot in western North America based on a repository of ( 1 ) putative sightings and auditory detections ( n = 551 ) , and ( 2 ) footprint measurements ( n = 95 ) collected from 1944 to 2005 ( Fig. 1 ) .
This data set was taken from a collection of reported Bigfoot encounters archived by the Bigfoot Field Researchers Organization ( BFRO ; http://www.bfro.net/news/google_earth.asp).
The reports generally consisted of a description of the event and where it occurred .
The reports used were filtered to eliminate spurious points by carefully examining event descriptions prior to incorporation in the present study .
The events were assigned geographic coordinates by matching descriptions of event locations to actual locations on USGS quad maps and commercially available atlases .
Figure 1 Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Map of Bigfoot encounters from Washington , Oregon and California used in the analyses .
Points represent visual / auditory detection , and foot symbols represent coordinates where footprint data were available .
Shading indicates topography , with lighter values representing lower elevations .
ENMs were constructed using the maximum entropy niche modelling approach implemented in the software maxent v3.1 ( Phillips et al. , 2006 ) , with 80 % of the data used in training and 20 % retained as test points .
Environmental data layers were constructed for the 19 BIOCLIM variables ( at 5 ‐arcminute resolution ) in the WORLDCLIM data set ( Hijmans et al. , 2005 ) .
To reduce the number of bioclimatic variables in order to minimize model overfitting , we extracted climate data for 5000 random points sampled from the geographic extent of our study and calculated correlations between each variable for these points .
For pairs with a correlation coefficient > | 0.80| , one variable was selected .
This resulted in a set of nine variables : ( 1 ) annual mean temperature , ( 2 ) mean diurnal range , ( 3 ) isothermality , ( 4 ) temperature annual range , ( 5 ) mean temperature of wettest quarter , ( 6 ) mean temperature of driest quarter , ( 7 ) precipitation seasonality , ( 8 ) precipitation of warmest quarter , and ( 9 ) precipitation of coldest quarter .
maxent appeared to perform well in our analysis , according to the area under the receiver operating characteristic curve ( AUC ) and threshold ‐based evaluation methods ( Phillips et al. , 2006 ) .
The ENM had an AUC of 0.983 and strongly rejected the hypothesis that test points are predicted no better than by a random prediction for all thresholds implemented in maxent .
No locality points fell outside the predicted distribution , with the exception of a single observation from Imperial , California .
In general , the ENM shows that Bigfoot should be broadly distributed in western North America , with a range comprising western North American mountain ranges such as the Sierra Nevada Mountains , the Cascades , the Blue Mountains , the southern Selkirk Mountains , and the Coastal Range of the Pacific Northwest .
Based on jackknife analyses for models including each variable alone , ‘ precipitation of the coldest quarter ’ was the bioclimatic variable that contributed most to the ENM , followed by ‘ temperature annual range ’ , ‘ mean temperature of the wettest quarter ’ , and ‘ mean temperature of the driest quarter ’ .
An ENM produced using footprint data alone was highly similar to that for all sighting data ( not shown ) .
It is expected that species distributions are likely to be altered under global warming , and a number of studies have used environmental layers derived from climate ‐change models to project contemporary distributions into the future using ENMs ( Hijmans & Graham , 2006 ; Pearson et al. , 2006 ; Loarie et al. , 2008 ) .
Despite potential weaknesses in such approaches ( Pearson et al. , 2006 ) , we were interested in examining the potential ramifications of climate change on hypothetical remnant Sasquatch populations and to predict how the frequency of sightings might change in the future .
We projected ENMs generated from the WORLDCLIM data onto bioclimatic layers simulated for a doubling of atmospheric CO 2 ( http://www.diva‐gis.org/climate.htm ) .
As expected for montane organisms , the model predicts Bigfoot to abandon lower altitudes and also to lose habitat in coastal regions ( Fig. 2b , c ) .
However , this loss of habitat should be compensated by a large potential gain in the northern part of the Sasquatch range and in several other montane areas ( e.g. Arizona , Nevada , Utah ) , should such areas remain undisturbed by human activity in the near future ( Fig. 2 c ) .
Thus , given our model and available data , we might expect Bigfoot sightings to increase in frequency in northern latitudes and at higher elevations over the coming years .
Figure 2
Open in figure viewer PowerPoint Predicted distributions of Bigfoot constructed from all available encounter data using maxent ( a ) for the present climate and ( b ) under a possible climate ‐change scenario involving a doubling of atmospheric CO 2 levels .
Results are presented for logistic probabilities of occurrence ranging continuously from low ( white ) to high ( black ) .
Differences between ( a ) and ( b ) are shown in ( c ) , with whiter values reflecting a decline in logistic probability of occurrence under climate change , darker values reflecting a gain , and grey reflecting no change .
A predicted distribution of Ursus americanus in western North America under a present ‐day climate is also shown ( d ) .
White points indicate sampling localities in California , Oregon and Washington taken from GBIF ( n = 113 for training , 28 for testing ; compare with Fig. 1 ) used for the maxent model with shading as in ( a ) and ( b ) ; black points indicate additional known records not included in the model .
Notably , the predicted distribution of Sasquatch ( Fig. 2a ) appears similar to that which might be expected for other large mammals of western North America , including the American black bear ( Ursus americanus Pallas , 1780 ) , sightings of which are thought to be sometimes confused as Bigfoot encounters ( Meldrum , 2007 ) .
We sampled records of U. americanus from the same states as considered for Bigfoot ( California , Oregon and Washington ) from GBIF .
We selected records for which physical specimens were available , allowing us to reasonably assume that black bears were not misidentified , and for which site localities could be georeferenced to a named place at minimum .
Although this level of geographical accuracy may not be ideal for many ENM applications , it should be sufficient for our purposes here .
We performed maxent runs as described above ( present climate only ) .
The model ( Fig. 2d ) performed well according to AUC ( both test and training AUC > 0.98 ) and all threshold statistics ( all P < 10 −47 ) .
However , visualizing all black bear records from GBIF reveals that limiting model training to locations within California , Oregon and Washington leads to an under‐prediction of the known distribution of U. americanus , particularly in New Mexico , Colorado , and parts of Canada and Mexico ( Fig. 2d ) .
Although this suggests some methodological limitations for the distribution models as implemented here , these other locality points may belong to different subspecies that experience unique environmental conditions in inland regions relative to the more coastally distributed specimens used in our analysis ( Larivière , 2001 ) .
Our ENM prediction does in fact appear quite similar to the distributions of the subspecies U. a. altifrontalis and U. a. californiensis ( Larivière , 2001 ) , supporting this possibility .
In any event , for our comparisons here , any under‐prediction should have little consequence since we expect such limitations to be shared by the Sasquatch model , given the similar distribution of locality points .
The general similarities between distributions of the two ‘ species ’ are clear ( Fig. 2a , d ) , despite the much smaller number of available black bear coordinates .
Furthermore , the exact same bioclimatic variables ( see above ) contributed most to the ENM when evaluated using maxent ’s variable jackknifing procedure .
We used the I‐statistic ( Warren et al. , 2008 ) to quantify the degree of similarity between the two ENMs using the program ENMTools .
The observed value of I = 0.849 indeed indicates a high degree of overlap , and falls well within the null distribution generated from maxent runs for 100 randomizations of Bigfoot and black bear coordinates ( Fig. 3 ; P < observed = 0.32 ) .
Thus , the two ‘ species ’ do not demonstrate significant niche differentiation with respect to the selected bioclimatic variables .
Although it is possible that Sasquatch and U. americanus share such remarkably similar bioclimatic requirements , we nonetheless suspect that many Bigfoot sightings are , in fact , of black bears .
Набирает ход скандал с хоккеистом юниорской сборно й России по хоккею Кириллом Кабановым , который в прошлом сезоне выступал за столичный « Спартак » , а ныне еще не заключил договор с « Салаватом Юлаевым » .
Уфимский клуб и отец игрока обменялись мнениями в разговоре с корреспондентом « Газеты .
Ru » .
И позиции сторон , мягко говоря , разделились .
Реклама
По словам генерального менеджера « Салавата Юлаева » Олега Гросса , если нападающи й Кирилл Кабанов не приедет в клуб , то он поставит под угрозу свою карьеру в России .
« Знаю о том , что отец игрока заявляет , что у них нет подписанного контракта с клубом , — заявил Гросс . —
Но это не проблема , ведь « Спартак » уступил нам свои права на игрока , так что Кабанов обязан подписать бумаги согласно регламенту .
И лига на этот счет свою позицию озвучила .
Так что если завтра он не прибудет в расположение команды , то мы оповестим всех об этом .
И будем требовать дисквалификации .
В таком случае в
России он вряд ли будет играть .
Что касается его иска к « Спартаку » , то это никак не влияет на то , что игрок должен заключить контракт с нами .
Права его принадлежат нам , а судиться с бывшей командой он может сколько угодно .
Пункт об отъезде в НХЛ и вовсе незаконный .
И у « Спартака » на то было соответствующее решение КХЛ .
Мы требование об отъезде в НХЛ вносить никуда не собираемся » .
Отец Кирилла Кабанова Сергей так прокомментировал новость об угрозе дисквалификации .
« Контракт а как такового с уфимцами мы не подписывали , — сказал он . – Потому что то , что нам предложили подписать , не соответствует договору , который был со « Спартаком » .
И худшие условия мы принимать не собираемся .
Так что или наши , или никаких .
Во вторник мы вообще подаем в суд на « Спартак » , который не до конца выполнил условия контракта .
Нам остались должны за прошлый сезон .
И договор с красно - белыми может быть расторгнут , а мой сын станет свободным агентом .
Да он вообще не имел права его подписывать , так как не входит в профсоюз .
Да и есть закон , согласно которому ребенок может сменить город жительства только с согласия родителей .
Мы просто хотим , чтоб ы Кирилл смог участвовать в драфте НХЛ , а также мог покинуть клуб в случае отъезда за океан .
Поверьте , это совсем не говорит о том , что уже летом сын уедет .
Если он не будет готов , то год - два еще сыграет в России .
Мы же могли перебраться за океан и раньш е … А вот то , что пишут про номер – ерунда .
Мы в контракте не требуем никакого номера !
Это неправда .
А вот насчет НХЛ мы требуем , чтобы контракт был такой же , который у нас был со « Спартаком » .
Там был этот пункт , значит , он должен быть и теперь » .
По слова м Кабанова - старшего , если его сын по результатам суда получит статус свободного агента , то тогда придется подбирать клуб в высшей лиге или же перебираться в Северную Америку .
« О КХЛ в таком случае придется забыть » , — сказал он .
« Я хочу , чтобы моему сыну просто не мешали играть , — сказал отец игрока .
– Никаких денег у
Уфы мы не брали , даже на медицинское обследование приезжали и уезжали на свои .
Заявление о приеме на работу он не писал , подпись под приказом не ставил , а его трудовая книжка и вовсе находится до сих пор в « Спартаке » .
Представители же красно - белых новость о судебном иске оставили без комментария .
Тем временем новички « Спартака » определились с номерами , под которыми они будут выступать в наступающем сезоне .
Алексей Яхин взял № 50 , Евгений Болякин – № 18 , Александр Бутурлин – № 15 , Алексей Заварухин – № 19 , Илья Каблуков – № 29 , Игорь Мусатов – № 21 , Илья Малюшкин – № 35 , Ярослав Обшут – № 43 , Мартин Цибак – № 8 .
Задрафтованные нынешним летом молодые нападающие выбрали следующие номера : Сергей Чистяков – № 16 , Александр Гоголев – № 71 , Артём Воронин – № 91 .
Кроме того , сменил игровой номер Александр Рыбаков .
Теперь на его свитере будет цифр а

WASHINGTON  Senator John Ensign ’s wealthy parents gave almost $ 100,000 to his former lover and her family , ostensibly out of concern for their welfare and as part of a “ pattern of generosity , ” his lawyer disclosed Thursday .
A statement by his lawyer , Paul Coggins , on behalf of the Mr. Ensign , a Republican from Nevada , said that in April 2008 the senator ’s parents each gave $ 12,000 apiece to Cindy Hampton , her husband , Doug , and two of their children in the form of a single check for $ 96,000 .
“ The payments were made as gifts , accepted as gifts and complied with tax rules governing gifts , ” the statement read .
Under federal tax regulations , $ 12,000 is the most that a person can give as a gift without having to declare or pay taxes on it .
But despite the assertion that the gifts were above - board , the latest revelation concerning Mr. Ensign ’s indiscretion  his first public confirmation that gifts were made to his former lover  is sure to provide grist for political detractors .

Are you ready for the next challenge ?
Implement some brain fuck interpreter using the game of life .
It 's turing complete after all ;-)
I could probably do that , but it would take a long time .
It ’s a simple language after all .
Caveat : Input will be a royal pain .
Still , wo n’t be doing it anytime soon .
To give you an idea of how it will look , it will look a little like the Spartan Universal Computer Constructor or the Life Pi Calculator .

Also , it will be incredibly huge , far beyond the capabilities of that poor BrainF program that I call , “ The Life Play Button ” .
It will require a fairly efficient implementation of HashLife , likely beyond anything that can realistically be written in BrainF , at least without “ obsessive optimization ” .
Worse , you probably wo n’t even get a pattern download anytime soon .
Even worse , when you do manage to find the download link ( in the future ) , you will likely still be frustrated by the notable lack of speed and the difficulty of making it “ faster ” , despite some instructions given in the ZIP file .
So , not very good .
And , by the way , there are Game of Life interpreters in the Game of Life .
They are just incredibly huge , slow , and laggy , just like what I think my interpreter would be like .
Let ’s end it at that .
Bye !

The Portable Brainfuck Interpreter ( by Urban Mueller , who also created the language ) has an undocumented feature : Because the program and its data are kept in the same array , it is possible to write .
Regard this simple Quine :
I admit it , I 'm a geek .
When I first started making cards like these , I was in highschool , and during the course of the two years I spent there ( before ditching it and jumping straight into college early ) I put together about a thousand .
Why the discontinued Star Wars CCG ?
I like the system ... and it was popular among the nerdy types during my high school years .
Without a doubt , these cards are some of the best .
I mean , what game ( or movie ) is n't made a million times better if evil Nazis appear suddenly and must be dealt with harshly and quickly ?
Imagine the look on your opponent 's face when you slap down " SPAM , " or when Darth Vader goes cruising across the Dagobah Swamp in the Redneck Express .
Terrify your nerdy friends who have a special place in their heart for Final Fantasy ( or Star Trek ) with the Summoner Worna card , and watch as the SDF - 1 and the Blue Valkyrie take on a fleet of Imperial Star Destroyers ... and win ( okay , maybe not against a fleet , but against one , they 'd probably do okay . )
But the sweetest thing ?
Probably a duel to the death with lightsabers between Yoda and Pope Benedict !
( You 've got to admit , it 's much cooler to be able to play the pope against a rebel opponent than to just throw any old Darth Vader or Emperor Palpatine out there . )
Also :
These cards are fan - made , which means they are n't official and that I have no affiliation whatsoever with either Decipher ( Makers of the original SW : CCG these are modeled after ) or the people who are awesome enough to create and bring us the shows , movies , etc. that some of the images come from ( Cute Face is my Stepbrother ! ) but I 've still made them look as awesome as possible so you can enjoy them and even mix them right into your deck if you choose !
The report by USDA 's Center for Nutrition Policy and Promotion notes that family income affects child rearing costs .
A family earning less than $ 56,870 per year can expect to spend a total of $ 159,870 ( in 2008 dollars ) on a child from birth through high school .
Similarly , parents with an income between $ 56,870 and $ 98,470 can expect to spend $ 221,190 ; and a family earning more than $ 98,470 can expect to spend $ 366,660 .
In 1960 , a middle - income family could have expected to spend $ 25,230 ( $ 183,509 in 2008 dollars ) to raise a child through age seventeen .
The U.S. Department of Agriculture , which is apparently concerned with more than raising crops , has announced that the estimated cost of raising a child born in 2008 from birth to age 18 is $ 221,190 .
If you adjust for expected inflation before the child reaches adulthood , that figure is $ 291,570 .
Your mileage may vary .
When you consider the income levels in these calculations , it does n't seem all that bad .
Many families spend more than that on a house .
Then again , the child 's shelter expense is the biggest item on the total bill , comprising 32 % of the total .

The BBC's Asian Network was at the centre of a fresh race row last night after Sikhs accused the digital radio station of being insensitive towards their religion .
BBC bosses were forced to remove a show by the popular Muslim presenter Adil Ray from their website after the morning show DJ received threats from angry Sikh listeners who accused him of denigrating an important religious symbol .
The Birmingham - based network , which was set up eight years ago after the BBC's then director general Greg Dyke described his own organisation as " hideously white " , has strongly denied the accusations or any suggestion that Ray meant to mock Sikhism .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But the anger from the Sikh community has nonetheless raised fresh questions over whether the digital network is serving its Asian listeners .
Earlier this year , the BBC Trust told the network that it needed to attract more listeners after its audience fell from half a million to 405,000 in a year .
The complaints revolve around a show broadcast on Thursday 6 August in which Ray discussed the cancellation of a Punjabi music concert in Canada where police had banned a number of Sikhs who refused to remove their " kirpan " dagger – one of five ceremonial symbols that baptised Sikhs are expected to wear at all times .
A number of listeners believed that Ray had been disparaging about whether Sikhs really needed to carry their kirpans and began making complaints and threats against him .
This is not the first time the network has found itself facing anger from within the Asian community .
The Labour peer Lord Ahmed last year accused the network of being biased against Muslims in favour of Sikhs and Hindus , although an internal investigation by the BBC later exonerated it .
The Sikh Media Monitoring Group has written to the BBC asking for a full transcript of Adil Ray 's show and accused the station of being insensitive towards Sikh listeners .
" We should not be paying a licence fee for promoting the ignorance - based ramblings of those bent on self - promotion who sneer at Asian religion and culture , " said Hardeep Singh , a spokesman for the group .
Indarjit Singh , veteran Sikh journalist and head of the Network of Sikh Organisations , said Britain 's Asian communities should move away from stations aimed at a small demographic .
" Stations like BBC Asian Network do little to encourage integration and social cohesion because they allow communities to ghettoise themselves , " he said .
" Twenty or 30 years ago , when immigrants came to the country and were often surrounded by hostile communities , it was important to have these sorts of networks but , nowadays , I feel there is less need for them . "
Supporters of the Asian Network , however , say the radio station provides a vital voice for Britain 's Asians in the otherwise white - dominated industries of media and broadcasting .
Sunny Hundal , the Sikh - born editor of Asians in Media magazine , said yesterday : " The Beeb already bends over backwards to these groups who are simply trying to promote their own agenda . "
A spokesman for the Asian Network defended its morning presenter .
" Adil Ray did not make any judgement about people 's faith or the rights and wrongs of wearing the kirpan .
We welcome the fact that Adil has listeners of all faiths who enjoy his humour and presentation . "
This week , Mel Martinez accepted a lobbying gig less than two weeks after resigning from the Senate .
Martinez heads straight to K Street
It used to be that lawmakers were coy about any ideas they had about heading for K Street , waiting until their terms ended before announcing they were beginning a more lucrative career .
But in recent years , members of Congress planning to become lobbyists have not been able to wait .
In fact , when Florida Republican Mel Martinez this week accepted a position with the mega - lobbying and law firm DLA Piper — less than two weeks after resigning from the Senate — it brought to five the number of former lawmakers since 2007 who have abandoned their constituents midterm and almost immediately resurfaced with lobbying firms , according to data provided by the nonpartisan Center for Responsive Politics .
Advertisement
“ This used to be considered unacceptable , but it really is a growing phenomenon , ” said Meredith McGehee , who lobbies for stricter lobbying and ethics regulations for the nonpartisan Campaign Legal Center .
“ The reality is that the money has gotten so big and so tempting these days , that I think a lot of these members are saying , ‘ I do n’t think I ’ll go back into political office , first of all , and , the money is just too big to turn down . ’ ”
Martinez was traveling in Brazil and could not be reached for comment , but in February , his office insisted he would serve until the end of his term in January 2011 before retiring from Congress to spend more time with his family .
Last month , though , he reversed course , announcing he would step down as soon as Florida Gov. Charlie Crist appointed a successor .
That prompted some quick recruitment outreach by DLA partner Ignacio Sanchez , who has been active in Republican politics and knew Martinez — a former trial lawyer , Orange County , Fla. , mayor , secretary of Housing and Urban Development and Republican National Committee chairman — from Florida legal circles and their shared interest in Cuban - American issues .
“ When he announced he was going to retire and let the governor appoint someone to finish out the term , I immediately talked to him and said , ‘ You really ought to consider looking at our firm .
I think you would really do well , and we would love to have you , ’” Sanchez told the Blog of LegalTimes .
Sanchez , who was traveling with Martinez and also could not be reached , told the BLT that
Martinez met with folks from DLA before he formally stepped down from the Senate but stressed that the firm extended “ no financial terms , no offer , no details ” to Martinez until after he resigned Sept.
9 .
“ We did n’t have any discussions with him until he decided to leave the Senate , and we did n’t conduct any negotiations with him of any sort until he had left the Senate , ” said John Merrigan , a DLA partner .
Merrigan pointed out that DLA has employed many former members of Congress , including former House Majority Leaders Dick Gephardt and Dick Armey , and employs ethics experts to ensure compliance with congressional rules and restrictions .
A 2007 law requires members of Congress to disclose negotiations with prospective employers .
The Secretary of the Senate ’s office , which would be the repository for such disclosures , had not received one from Martinez as of Thursday .
But Sanchez ’s outreach would not have invoked the rules , said Brett Kappel , a lobbying lawyer , though Craig Holman , who lobbies for stricter disclosure requirements for the nonpartisan group Public Citizen , said the rules leave wiggle room .
The pre-employment negotiation provision was prompted partly by former Louisiana Rep. Billy Tauzin ’s acceptance of a job heading the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers of America in 2005 , a year after he helped write a law that expanded Medicare payments for prescription drug , which redounded to Big Pharma ’s benefit .
Tauzin , a Republican , waited until after his term expired to take the PhRMA job , which reportedly paid him $ 2.5 million a year .
But in December 2007 , then - Sen . Trent Lott ( R - Miss . ) left Congress with years left in his term to create a lobbying firm , while Rep. Dennis Hastert ( R - Ill . ) stepped down in November 2007 , only to accept a position in 2008 with the lobbying firm Dickstein Shapiro .
In 2008 , Rep. Al Wynn ( D - Md. ) , who was defeated in a primary , and Rep. Richard Baker ( R - La . ) left before their terms expired to take lobbying jobs — Baker with the Managed Funds Association : and Wynn with Dickstein Shapiro .
Lobbyists ’ salaries are not public information , but last year , Martinez ’s new firm DLA , which registered nearly 50 lobbyists , reported more than $ 11.8 million in lobbying revenue , which does n’t include legal and consultation fees unrelated to lobbying .
Martinez , who is barred from lobbying his former colleagues for two years , will advise clients on government affairs , litigation , financial services , real estate , energy , defense , infrastructure development and other matters , according to a DLA press release announcing his arrival .
In the release , DLA ’s Global Chairman Francis B. Burch Jr. , boasted of Martinez ’s clout “ on both Capitol Hill and in his home state of Florida , ” as well as his “ significant network of international contacts , particularly in Spain and in Latin America , which will be a major area of growth and expansion for DLA Piper over the next year . ”
According to the firm , DLA has an office in Tampa , and Martinez will spend the bulk of his time working from Florida .

The FIA is to launch an investigation into the events at last year 's Singapore Grand Prix , where Renault 's Fernando Alonso claimed victory on the back of a crash by his team - mate Nelson Piquet .
Alonso 's success was sealed by the timing of a safety car in the early stages of the inaugural event - which had been called out when Piquet crashed into the wall shortly after his team - mate stopped for fuel .
The timing of Piquet 's crash prompted wild conspiracy theories that the Brazilian had been ordered to deliberately spin to help Renault take its first victory of the year .
Piquet himself insisted at the time that the accident had been caused by him simply trying too hard .
" It was my mistake , " said Piquet .
" We tried two extreme strategies with Fernando quite short and me quite long in the hope of getting a safety car .
If I had n't crashed I would have been lucky with the safety car later in the race because I was very happy .
" We 're always scraping the walls , and once you 've touched the wall a little too much and lose control that 's it . "
It is understood , however , that fresh evidence about the events that took place in the race have now come to light - which has prompted the FIA to step in .
Piquet was dropped by Renault after this year 's Hungarian Grand Prix , and has been outspoken in his criticisms of the outfit - and in particular team principal Flavio Briatore .
It is not clear if the Brazilian himself has been a catalyst for the investigation , or if the evidence has come from elsewhere .
The FIA has not elaborated on the details of its inquiry , but a spokesperson confirmed to AUTOSPORT that an investigation was under way .
" The FIA can confirm that an investigation is underway regarding alleged events at a previous world championship race , " said the spokesperson .
Should the FIA investigation suggest there is any evidence of foul play involved , then the governing body could call a hearing of the World Motor Sport Council to discuss the matter .
THIS summer the unvarying male uniform in the precincts of Brooklyn cool has been a pair of shorts cut at knickers length , a V - neck Hanes T - shirt , a pair of generic slip - on sneakers and a straw fedora .
Add a leather cuff bracelet if the coolster is gay .
In truth this get - up was pretty much the unvarying male uniform last summer also , but this year an unexpected element has been added to the look , and that is a burgeoning potbelly one might term the Ralph Kramden .
Too pronounced to be blamed on the slouchy cut of a T - shirt , too modest in size to be termed a proper beer gut , developed too young to come under the heading of a paunch , the Ralph Kramden is everywhere to be seen lately , or at least it is in the vicinity of the Brooklyn Flea in Fort Greene , the McCarren Park Greenmarket and pretty much any place one is apt to encounter fans of Grizzly Bear .
What the trucker cap and wallet chain were to hipsters of a moment ago , the Kramden is to what my colleague Mike Albo refers to as the “ coolios ” of now .
Leading with a belly is a male privilege of long standing , of course , a symbol of prosperity in most cultures and of freedom from anxieties about body image that have plagued women since Eve .
Who Ya Gunna Call ?
by David ' Hades ' Becker [ Monday , 6th of July 2009 - 04:38 PM ]
So we all knew it was inevitable .
With the new BluRay and video game out for the Ghostbusters franchise .
Now they are invading the LittleBigPlanet world .
Well at least we can assume that with the below image from the PlayStation Blog .
No official word has been given about it yet , the blog post is just the image and the phrase " Who Ya Gunna Call ? " on it .
But it is probably safe to assume that we will be getting the close to racist looking Sack Boy in our LBP sometime in the not to distant future .
I 'm sure there will be more details following shortly once the internet explodes with comments and questions about all of this .
Not a bad way to generate excitement for a game that has been out for almost a year now .
Call me crazy , but drugging and raping a 13 year old is kind of a bad thing .
It ’s kind of like …well , DRUGGING THEN RAPING A 13 YEAR OLD .
There ’s a lot of misinformation and urban legends surrounding Roman Polanski , but one thing is certain : he ’s admitted to drugging and then raping a 13 year old .
Sure , Roman Polanski has had a hard life .
His wife was murdered , and he grew up in Warsaw during the Second World War .
He has had some bad circumstances in which to live .
This is n’t lost on me — that ’s a shitty hand to be dealt .
What I also understand is that he has n’t been in trouble since drugging and raping that 13 year old girl .
That ’s quite an achievement for someone who drugged then raped a 13 year old girl .
One thing about the drugging rape of the 13 year old girl that I used to believe was that the girl lied about her age .
Hey , you know , it happens .
So then Roman Polanski should n’t be punished for drugging and raping a 13 year old girl , he should be punished for drugging and raping a…. wait a minute !
That ’s kind of bad no matter how you put it .
The kicker to the whole “ she lied about her age ” defense is that Roman Polanski asked the girl ’s mother for permission to photograph her .
So , unless we ’re talking about a man who drugs and rapes 13 year old girls , but has maintained some kind of Victorian ethos about asking the mother for permission to photograph an adult daughter , Roman Polanski knew damn well that the girl he drugged and then raped was a minor .
Another urban legend out there is that Roman Polanski served his time , but a vicious , vengeful judge wanted to make an example of a celebrity who drugged and raped a 13 year old girl .
It is true that Polanski served some time for the rape .
He put in a solid 42 days of a 90 day psych evaluation for the rape , then once released from the psychiatric evaluation , he fled the country .
According to a Washington Post article ( September 20 , 1977 ) , Polanski “ … was ordered imprisoned for a 90 - day psychiatric study to help the judge decide his sentence . ”
That was n’t his sentence , that was an evaluation .
Polanski fled not because of an overzealous judge , but because his actual sentencing was coming up ( for drugging , then raping a 13 year old girl ) .
Now that Polanski is in custody , there are going to be articles of support for him , and articles decrying his actions .
There is going to be a lot of revisionist attitudes , and those old ‘ Roman Polanski was the real victim ’ bullshit arguments .
One has already been put up on HuffPost .
John Farr ( some unknown hack who reviews movies for a living ) wrote a piece calling for leniency for Polanski because he ’s been ‘ rehabilitated ’ .
If by that he means living in the lap of luxury and completely avoiding being punished for drugging and raping a 13 year old , then yeah , he ’s completely rehabilitated .
Please , for all that ’s right in the world , think about this case .
Think about a 13 year old girl being fed champagne and quaaludes by a 44 year old man .
Think about how he led her to a bed , refused to stop when she repeatedly said “ No ! ” , performed oral and anal acts upon her person , and think about his complete lack of spine .
Think about how he fled the country to live in luxury .
Think about it all .
Say it with me :
He drugged and raped a 13 year - old girl .
Cultivation : Tulips need a dormant , quasi - hibernating stage in a cool climate and hence temperate climate of mountainous zones suit it rather well .
At places where summers hit the town early and spring last longer than usual belting out zephyrs , tulips tend to grow better .
Bulbs are planted during the fag end of summer and commencement of autumn .
In porous soil , the bulbs are planted about 10 to 20 centimeters deep .
Also , in those places where there are climactic variations , the plants settle for one bulb a year rather than myriad non-blooming ones .
This way , the plants can be lively for a longer duration in warmer belts .
Propagation : Micro propagation , seeding and offsetting are the principal methods of propagating tulips .
The first method uses plant tissue culture and ensures arithmetic multiplication of stocks thereby creating a large number of progenies .
Through this method , propagation results in creation of adequate amount of plantlets from stock plant .
Plants raised via seeds are unique in terms of their variation .
Single early , double early , single late , triumph and Darwin are a few of the groups used for tulips .
Those who run via the offsetting method need to pour in a little more time as a year is required before the plants are big enough to flower .
Varieties : Tulip has many variations and is resplendent in all its varieties .
Single early tulips known for forcing and bedding have large blooms and are big .
Double tulips are bi-petalled with long enduring blooms .
Darwin tulips are longest and come in great many colors .
There are many more varieties too .
Lily flower tulips , vridiflora tulips , triumph , parrot and cottage tulips are a few more among the tulip diaspora .
Greigii , fosteriana and kaufmanniana also present an illustrious fare .
Double daffodils are also known to sparkle the tulip shows .
Disease and Cure : Botritis tulipae is a fungal disorder that is consequential in the rotting and decay of this beautiful flower .
Tulip also suffers from black and blue molds , mushy decays , bacterial decay , blight and anthracnose .
A Potyvirus in the Dutchland that was attributed to bestowing a wide array of colors to tulips also caused rotting in the flower .
Variegation and multicoloring are also sometimes the result of some kind of disease in tulips .
Often the diseases are caused owing to high volumes of production and also negative tolerance towards environmental debilities .
Charring the infected plants and sterilizing the adjoining areas can be among the best solutions for curing tulip disease .
Outright prevention is hardly possible .
Removal of foliage and abstaining form planting tulips in the same spot for a minimum of three years is also among the very best methods .

I recently chanced onto a conceptual framework to describe the development of version control systems that I have seen nowhere else .
It came out of a job far bigger than anticipated at the outset : an innocent edit to a a wiki article that ended up stretching across 4 days , in the course of which I would add relevant points , only to discover some new structure trying to emerge , which as I was rearranging and rewriting to bring out would remind me of yet more relevant points .
By the end I was quite tired and wanting to be done , but the effort also ended up thoroughly crystallising my conceptualisation of version control systems .
So I thought I should also give it the additonal exposure of my weblog .
Note that these individual points are all well known ; I have long been aware of them .
But it was only during this work that I came to understand their relations systematically .
Remember too that getting from each step to the next in this sequence took a long time , both because it took time to realise that there was a problem in the first place , and because the respective right solution was not clear from foresight – trivially obvious as it may all seem when you see it laid out like here .
1+1 : One Repository , One Working Copy
The design of the earliest systems revolved around versioning a single working copy , directly edited by all users .
To prevent attempts at simultaneous modification of a single file , editing was not allowed without checking files out , which only one user at a time could do for any given file .
Having to give each user access to the same machine and file system in order to work on code was natural at the time these systems were designed , in the mainframe era , but today would obviously be a problem .
Also , the requirement to check files out was a cause of friction even at the time , since everyone has to wait on one another – not to mention that someone might forget to check a file back in before leaving on vacation .
1+n : One Repository , Many Working Copies
The next evolutionary step was to decouple the repository from the working copy , so that there may then be many working copies .
The exemplar in this class of systems , known as centralised VCS s , is CVS .
It lifts the obvious restrictions of earlier systems with a design in which the repository is mediated by a server .
Multiple users can collaborate by each checking out a private working copy of the project .
Note that in CVS , “ checking out ” no longer implies locking .
( In other centralised VCS s , it may ; e.g. Visual SourceSafe .
In some , such as Perforce , it is optional . )
Checking in changes is simply blocked if someone else has already checked in other changes in the meantime .
Before the latecomer is allowed to check in their own changes , they have to update their working copy with the upstream changes , resolving any conflicts manually .
This works reasonably well .
CVS ended up as the de facto standard for a decade .
However , its single - repository nature , subsequently adopted by most following major systems , perpetuates problems harking back to the earlier model – and adds new ones :
Checking in changes under such a system requires a network connection , as do most operations related to the project history .
Besides the fact that this makes offline work nearly impossible , it also imposes a major performance penalty , since networked operations are inescapably slow .
Some systems , like Subversion , try to selectively speed up some of these operations by keeping more data in the working copy , but the benefit of this is uneven across operations .
Further , high traffic repositories may require rather beefy servers and connections to sustain .
Anything checked in is always public ; this means one has to be very careful about the state of commits .
It also makes it impossible to touch up history ( e.g. to fix common mistakes like forgetting to include a new file in a commit ) .
Branches become a big deal : all commits are publicly visible , no matter how experimental .
Also , branch names are forced into a global namespace so a lot of thought has to be given to choosing them .
Branching is problematic for more reasons too .
Most of these systems do not support branch merging very well : after you do it once , the changes from the merged - in branch are mixed in without any tracking , so later attempts to merge the same branch will result in lots of artificial conflicts .
This makes it very difficult to keep branches in synch .
But the longer branches go without merging , the more effort it takes to merge them .
All this adds up to a large barrier , psychological and otherwise , against branching .
The single - repository nature means that anyone who wants the safety of revision control needs to have write access to the same repository .
And since branching is badly supported , everyone with access to the repository is generally going to be working on the same trunk .
This means write access has to be given out selectively , to competent people only , resulting in political headaches within projects , while outsiders are forced to create their patches in an unversioned ghetto .
n+n : Many Working Copies , Paired With Equally Many Repositories
The solution to all this was to not only give each collaborator a separate working copy , but a separate repository also .
This class of system , whose pioneering solid implementation was BitKeeper , is known as distributed version control systems .
The technical basis that allows this is algorithmic merging : 3 - way merging ( in the simplest case ) allows combining non-overlapping changes automatically , and merge point tracking allows repeatedly merging branches without unnecessary conflicts .
Since each collaborator has their own repository and can make commits , the effect is that everyone has their own private branch , with full versioning for local changes , and these branches can be published at the discretion of their author and can be merged by others easily .
Actually , each collaborator often has several local branches – since merging is easy and branches never “ need ” be published , it is painless to create short - lived branches for experiments or tests , to use them as a general workflow aspect ( e.g. start a new branch for every separate bug fix ) , or for any other purpose , whether intended for public consumption or not .
Everyone has full offline access to the project history , and all repository operations ( except pushing or pulling changes , obviously ) take place at full local disk speed .
All this immensely accelerates collaborative development and removes the political headaches surrounding commit access .

Fox News has hopped on the latest right wing conspiracy theory that congressional districts that supported Barack Obama are getting more federal stimulus money that those that supported McCain .
Fox News ’ Stuart Varney opened his piece with , “ It ’s not who you know , but who you voted for … ”
Of course , FNC ignored the obvious explanation for the imbalance .
Here is the video courtesy of Think Progress :

Republican pollster Chris Wilson claimed that there was a cause and effect relationship between supporting Obama and federal stimulus money .
Wilson said , “ For the past election cycle if you live in a county that voted for Barack Obama you got $ 69 distributed to you .
If you live in a county that voted for John McCain you only get $ 34 distributed to you , but the challenging part of this is that ’s not where it stops .
You can look into the future and the state that gets the most money per person is actually New Jersey .
It ’s getting $ 172 , and guess what the Democratic governor of New Jersey is down anywhere from 6 to 8 points in the recent polling , but they are doing their best to make sure there is enough money in the state to win that election for them . ”
Republicans are getting their data from a USA Today analysis which tracked the first $ 17 billion in stimulus spending .
However the analysis itself , refutes this conspiracy theory , “ Not all of the money favors places that supported Obama .
About a third of the $ 17 billion , or $ 5.5 billion , in contracts that the federal government has signed for projects ranging from repaving runways to cleaning up nuclear waste has gone overwhelmingly to counties that supported McCain …
The imbalance did n’t start with the stimulus .
From 2005 through 2007 , the counties that later voted for Obama collected about 50 % more government aid than those that supported McCain , according to spending reports from the U.S. Census Bureau . ”
Instead of this being some vast Obama conspiracy , what is really going on here is that the people who were hardest hit by the economic crisis did n’t vote for the guy who said that the fundamentals of the economy were strong .
If many of the same counties also got extra federal funding from 2005 - 2007 under Republican President Bush , does n’t that undercut the notion that Obama is using the stimulus as political payola ?
It does n’t take a rocket scientist to read the whole USA Today analysis , but apparently that would be too much to ask of Republicans who are so busy trying to earn political points that they ca n’t be bothered with facts .
No one should be surprised that FNC ran with this , because they are the same network that ran with the auto dealership conspiracy too .
Useless FACT
Over 800 Wildlife Species Died Out and 17,000 on the Edge of Extinction
Added by viorel on Jul 06 , 2009 | Visited by 4895 | Voted by 61 persons
According to the International Union for Conservation of Nature , during the past five hundred years over 800 animal and plant species disappeared and almost 17,000 currently face extinction .
By analyzing these huge numbers it may become obvious that the international community will not be able to achieve its 2010 goal of boosting the biodiversity and preserving a lot of different life forms on the planet .
It is worth mentioning that in 2002 the majority of world governments made a commitment to take care of the endangered species and it seems like they failed .
The latest analysis carried out by IUCN is based on information unveiled in 2008 in the Red List of the union .
According to Jean - Christophe Vie , the editor of the report about extinct and to be extinct species , the new analysis of the International Union for Conservation of Nature was released to carry on with the goal for 2010 and focus on the link between environmental and financial crises .
\ " We do n\'t want to make a choice between nature and the economy ; we just want to bring nature to the same level when you have to take a decision .
Jobs are important but not jobs to the detriment of nature .
We have done that too much and look where we have arrived , \ " said Vie .
Figures in the new analysis show that 869 species died out since 1500 and today about 290 more species are considered extinct or seriously endangered .
The report shows that 16,928 species face extinction , among them 30 percent are amphibians , 25 percent are mammals and one eighth are birds .
In 2004 Red List had 784 extinctions , which means that over the past five years about 85 species died out .
The report also mentions that the list is still not full , having just 2.7 percent out of 1.8 million species studied .
Its authors wrote that the number of species that are threatened by extinction is \ " a gross underestimate but it does provide a useful snapshot of what is happening to all forms of life on Earth . \ "
It is worth mentioning that one of the critically endangered species is the Amur tiger with a population of less than 35 individuals .
More Serious than Economic Crisis
Vie said that this problem is much more serious than the economic and bank crisis .
He mentioned that one can go bankrupt and then rebuild a business or create a new one but in nature , once something is lost it can not be brought back or replaced .
The editor of the report says that the notion of biodiversity is considered to be secondary to economic stability by countries in North America and Europe , where there is little connection to natural products .
He says that in less developed regions people are closely connected to biodiversity which has a direct link with human prosperity .
According to Vie , in most of the world \'s nations the major problem is not related to finding a job , but to surviving everyday during the food crisis , finding food , which is African nations , for example is in short supply .
He also said that \" in most places this comes from biodiversity , from nature , from fish and plants . \"
The main problem linked with land - based species , is that people destroy them through farming , logging and development .
Currently climate change does not represent the number one threat , but things may change soon .
The report says that 17,000 species of birds , amphibians and reef - building corals are very vulnerable to climate change ; these include 30 percent of birds , 51 percent of corals and 41 percent of amphibians that at the moment do not face extinction .
The Amur Tiger
It is the largest cat in the world .
The latest research showed that despite the fact that up to 500 tigers managed to survive in the wild , the effective population is calculated in terms of their genetic diversity .
Amur tigers are considered to be the rarest species of tiger and at the beginning of the 20th century 9 subspecies of the Amur tiger and a population of 100,000 individuals worldwide was known .
Since then the impact of humans on the environment led to the extinction of 3 subspecies including the Javan tiger , Bali tiger and Caspian tiger .
In addition , humans cut the number of tigers on the planet down to 3,000 .
For many years the Amur tiger , also known as the Siberian tiger , lived over a large territory of northern China , the Korean peninsula , as well as on the territory of the farthest south areas of far east Russia .
With the human expansion throughout the 20th century the Amur tiger almost died out , with about 90 percent losing its habitat .
During the 1940s between 20 and 30 Amur tigers remained in the wild .
A recovery of the tiger began after a ban on hunting was established and specific conservation steps were made .
Of all the knots used to tie two ropes together the Zeppelin Bend is the best bar none .
And chances are you have never heard of it !
In this Survival Topic we will discuss one of the best knots of all time and explore its interesting history and usage in the days before you were born .
The Zeppelin Bend knot , also known as the Rosendahl Bend knot , is interesting for a number of reasons .
First and foremost is it an easy knot to tie , very secure , and jam proof ; which cannot be said of the other bend knots people typically tie and risk their lives on .
Another interesting facet of the Zeppelin knot story is that it has , inexplicably , become virtually lost to the world .
Even if you regularly use knots , and for wilderness survival enthusiasts knots are very important , you are likely to have never tied a Zeppelin knot .
This oversight has important ramifications ; it is likely you are not using Zeppelin knots to tie two ropes together and therefore your very survival could be at stake .
The “ Bend ” in Zeppelin
What exactly is the meaning of the word “ Bend ” in the phrase “ Zeppelin Bend ” ?
A bend refers to any knot that is used to tie two pieces of rope together or make a loop from one piece of rope .
Many of you are no doubt familiar with the common sheetbend knot , one of the most common knots used to tie two ropes together .
Perhaps you even stake your survival on sheetbend knots or similar variants while participating in adventure sports such as rock climbing , or building rope bridges , mooring water craft , and off - road travel by vehicle .
Other common bend knots include the water knot , fisherman ’s knot , double fisherman ’s knot , carrick bend , and the rigger ’s or hunter ’s bend .
There are many more knots in this category and everybody has a favorite knot they use for anything from towing vehicles , to mooring boats and setting up clotheslines .
Sometimes these knots hold , sometimes they fail .
Use the Zeppelin Bend and you can rest assured the two ropes you tied together will not separate .
What ’s more , the knot does not jam and you can easily undo the knot even after tremendous force has been applied to it .
After reading this article and trying the Zeppelin Bend for yourself , you are likely to replace your old bend knot with this lost knot from yesteryear .
History of the Zeppelin Bend Knot
As I mentioned earlier , the Zeppelin Bend is a forgotten knot with an interesting history .
A knot that needs resurrection as one of the best knots of all time and a knot that is important for you to learn and use as a student of wilderness survival .
As I mentioned earlier , the Zeppelin Bend is a forgotten knot with an interesting history .
A knot that needs resurrection as one of the best knots of all time and a knot that is important for you to learn and use as a student of wilderness survival .
As you may have guessed from the name of the knot , the Zeppelin Bend gets its moniker from its association with the great lighter than air ships , or dirigibles , of the 1920’s .
These were commonly called “ Zeppelins ” in honor of Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin who was an early pioneer and advocate of these behemoths .
Of immense size and filled with hydrogen or helium , Zeppelins had a huge lifting capacity ; which also meant the knots used to tie them to the earth had to be completely secure , take massive strain , yet remain easy to untie when – and only when – wanted .
A tall order when mooring what is essentially a 160 meters long balloon bobbing in the wind and carrying a load of 10 tons ( 20,000 pounds ) !
The qualifying knot used to fasten Zeppelins to the earth ?
You guessed it , the Zeppelin Knot .
Charles Rosendahl , commander of the dirigible Los Angeles during the 1920′s would only allow one knot to be used for mooring his zeppelin , which is how the Zeppelin Bend know also came to be known as the “ Rosendahl Bend ” .
How to Make a Zeppelin Knot
Making a Zeppelin knot is quite easy and as with many things worth learning the telling is far more difficult than the actual doing .
My method for making a Zeppelin Bend knot is to first take a short bight from two ends of rope and place them adjacent to each other .
Form them into a “ ” 69 ” , which many Survival Topics readers are no doubt familiar with , so that the circle part of the “ 6 ” goes under itself and the circle part of the “ 9 ” goes over .
Next place the “ 6 ” on top of the “ 9 ” as shown so that the tails are opposite one another , forming a central ring of rope .
Wrap the tail of the six completely through the ring and then do likewise for the “ 9 ” , leading out the opposite sides of the knot .
Dress the knot by tightening up so that it makes a neat symmetrical bump .
Features of the Zeppelin Bend Knot
Easy to tie
Easy to untie even after heavy loads
Strong and secure
Jerk resistant
Jam resistant
Perfectly symmetric
Sounds like a knot to learn !
So the next time you need a dependable knot for tying two pieces of rope together or for making a secure loop , use the Zeppelin Bend .
It may very well save your life .

Police allege that no licences were produced for the seized weapons Police in Pakistan say they have raided the offices of a private security firm hired by the US embassy in Islamabad .
The offices of the Inter - Risk company were entered and around 70 weapons were seized and two personnel arrested .
Officials in Pakistan allege that the haul of 61 assault riffles , nine pistols and ammunition were unlicensed .
It follows allegations that the US is using the security firm once known as Blackwater .
The US embassy in Islamabad denies it has any contract with them .
The media in Pakistan have reported that the US embassy in Islamabad was involved in hiring the firm
Xe services , formerly known as Blackwater , a company which was embroiled in allegations of civilian killings while hired to protect US diplomats in Iraq .
A spokesman for the US embassy , Rick Snelsire , has confirmed a contract with Inter - Risk exists and said that " It is our understanding they [ Inter - Risk ] obtained licenses [ for ] whatever they brought into the country to meet their contractual needs . "
The US has denied it uses Xe services in Pakistan .
A senior police official , Rana Akram , said that two Inter - Risk employees were detained and are being questioned .
They were now seeking the company 's owner , a retired Pakistani army captain , the official added .
Police have denied any connection between the raid on Inter - Risk and the US embassy , but said they were working to protect foreigners living in the Islamabad and increasing vigilance ahead of the Muslim feast which marks the end of Ramadan .

Siobhan Gorman reports on intelligence .
Seven former Central Intelligence Agency directors lined up against Attorney General Eric Holder , who launched a criminal investigation into alleged abuses in the CIA ’s interrogation program .
In a letter to President Barack Obama , the seven — Michael Hayden and Porter Goss , who served under President George W. Bush ; George Tenet ( Bush and Clinton administrations ) ; John Deutch and R. James Woolsey ( Clinton administration ) ; William Webster ( Reagan and George H.W. Bush administrations ) , and James R. Schlesinger ( Nixon administration ) – asked that the investigation be dropped .
“ Those men and women who undertake difficult intelligence assignments in the aftermath of an attack such as September 11 must believe there is permanence in the legal rules that govern their actions , ” they wrote .
The current CIA director , Leon Panetta , earlier voiced similar opposition to Holder ’s probe .
Holder launched a preliminary investigation last month into fewer than 20 cases of potential criminal behavior that had been reviewed during the Bush administration .
The former CIA directors told Obama that reopening the cases “ creates an atmosphere of continuous jeopardy . ”
Besides requiring CIA officers to obtain lawyers , the new investigation will make them less willing to take risks and will damage relationships with foreign spy agencies , they said .
But the CIA officials are n’t likely to be happy .
The White House said it does n’t make decisions on investigations .
The letter was not shared ahead of time with Defense Secretary Robert Gates , who served as CIA director in the first Bush administration , or former president and CIA director George H.W. Bush out of respect for their current and former posts , said Jennifer Millerwise Dyck , spokeswoman for Goss .
Some 15 million people a year visit Venice
A hotel near Venice has accepted that its rooms were mistakenly advertised online at a mere one - hundredth of a euro instead of up to 150 euros ( £ 129 ) .
Nearly 230 people took advantage of the offer , booking on average more than six nights per person at the Crowne Plaza .
It is 20 km from central Venice , one of Italy 's main tourist destinations .
The hotel is run by the Intercontinental Hotels Group ( IHG ) which says it will honour bookings made while the mistake was online .
The company says the mistake was made at the offices of IHG in Atlanta , Georgia in the United States .
" Although a pricing error , IHG is committed to honouring the 1 - cent rate for guests who have a valid confirmation , " the hotel group 's Monica Smith said .
The wrong pricing for 1,400 room nights could cost the company up to 90,000 euros ( £ 77,800 ) .
Venice depends on tourism , attracting 15 million visitors a year .
Washington City Paper
- With crack and marijuana stashed in his pocket , Kenneth Millard and some friends scattered when an unmarked police car rolled into the parking lot outside his apartment building in Southeast .
The cops were looking for someone else , but Millard fell into the trap .
After bolting through a cut in the woods and stumbling down a steep hill , Millard bounced off the side of another police car blocking his escape route .
He dodged and weaved down Jasper Road SE until two officers tackled and cuffed him on the pavement .
Police said a Colt .22 handgun , loaded with 11 rounds , flew out of Millard 's waistband during the chase and landed near a manhole .
When officers caught Millard that February night in 2005 , they found 10 plastic bags filled with crack cocaine and marijuana in the right front pocket of his coveralls , according to court records .
Millard 's lengthy rap sheet was growing longer , and he was heading back to jail .
At his trial in 2006 , the jury convicted Millard on five drug and firearm charges , and the judge sentenced him to four - and - a - half years in prison .
But he just caught a break .
The D.C. Court of Appeals has reversed all of Millard 's convictions , wiping them off his record with a unanimous decision in March .
After overturning one of its own earlier precedents , the highest court in the District has reversed convictions in at least 14 cases involving drug dealers and others caught with drugs .
The reversals hinge on an important constitutional issue stemming from eight words tucked in the Sixth Amendment known as the Confrontation Clause .
In all criminal prosecutions , the accused has the right " to be confronted with the witnesses against him .
"
In Millard 's case , the " missing " witness was a chemist from the Drug Enforcement Administration whose drug analysis report stated that the baggies in Millard 's pocket contained cocaine and marijuana .
Because the analyst did n't appear in court , Millard 's drug convictions were reversed , but the firearm convictions were tossed out , too , because of weak evidence and their connection to the drug case .
The legal fight playing out in D.C. will be spreading across the nation after a Supreme Court decision in June in a case with striking similarities to Millard's .
The 5 - 4 ruling in Melendez - Diaz v. Massachusetts could result in thousands of reversed convictions and dismissed drug , drunken - driving , and other charges , creating the potential for chaos in the justice system .
Dear Straight Dope :
We tried both NASCAR and your own lovely message board -- but no such luck finding any answer to this question .
How do NASCAR drivers relieve themselves if the urge comes during the races ?
Is there a device in the driver suit or do they wait till the end of the race .
Thanks for any info you may have .

Ian replies :
L , these people are professional athletes , and you want to know when they make wee - wee ?
Does Major League Baseball get asked questions like this ?
First of all , drivers have the salaried equivalent of your mom telling you to go before you got in the car .
Crews are paid to prepare not only the cars , but the drivers , for races , and one of the duties of the crew is to monitor the driver ’s pre-race routine .
Hank Rogers , from R&H Motorsports , described it this way : “ If all goes well , Chris [ Hayes , on the NASCAR circuit ] will eat a meal of his choice around 10 pm , no later than 11 pm the night before a race .
If Mother Nature is doing her job , he will pass this meal 8 to 10 hours later , thereby hopefully eliminating the urge to use the race car as a restroom .
If we can catch Chris in the morning , we will try , and I say try to get him to eat a bowl of hot cereal before his ‘ well rounded pit stop ’
[ Hank explains that this pit stop takes place about an hour before the race ] , with the intention of reminding him that he may have other things to do before the race . ”
What about unplanned stops , right before the race ?
David Schenk , from the Sadler Racing Team , told me , “ Just prior to a race , you will see all of the drivers hitting the bathroom .
Last year on pit road at Talladega just before the race , I went into a Porta - Potty right after Bill Elliott , and when I came out , Jeff Gordon was waiting to use it . ”
I ’d like to be sure I was sitting on the pole for that particular contest , let me tell you .
A driver typically has a much more serious problem with dehydration than with overhydration , as it were .
The tracks get intensely hot ( 130 degrees plus , by some accounts ) , and the suits insulate the drivers quite efficiently .
Most drivers report a weight loss of 5 to 10 pounds of fluids over the course of a race .
Oh , and in those superinsulated suits , there is no specially adapted device for handling liquid waste .
Nor , according to the people I talked to , do drivers wear adult diapers , just in case .
However , I may have uncovered the racers ’ equivalent of an urban legend .
No one will admit to just going in the car , or to having any personal knowledge of such an incident , but everyone told me that they think it ’s happened , EVEN THOUGH I DIDN ’T ASK !!!
David Schenk ’s comment : “ I think I even remember one driver a couple of years back having to go so bad , he just wet his pants . ”
As a Straight Dope reader , you start to recognize these “ friend of a friend ” type stories right away .
I even crossed over to some open - wheel teams for the question .
A nice lady named Maryann at the Galles Racing Team tells it this way : “ However , if the urge strikes , it ’s up to the driver to basically ‘ wet his own diaper ’ as it were .
Believe it or not , it has happened !
I bet the crew gets pretty ugly after the races though . “
I can imagine .
Finally , there is another aspect to ‘ ” relieving oneself ” that it pains me to consider .
Here ’s a quote from a source that wanted to remain anonymous : “ If [ our driver ] has been ill , or has eaten something that has given him diarrhea , we will try and plug him up with Immodium AD , and needless to say , up til now , this has worked for us so far .
No accidents so far that I know of . “
I think they ’d know , do n’t you ?

The overriding principle of our project is that , contrary to current wisdom , it is possible to design and build a Formula One car in the United States ( rather than in Europe , where all the current teams build their cars ) .
Why would we want to do that ?
There are a number of good reasons :
Much of the current Formula One technology originates in the United States .
It is much more cost - efficient to design and build in the United States than in Europe ( as such car companies as BMW , Mercedes , Honda and Toyota have proven over the years ) .
Europe is crowded .
It ’s fine for Ferrari in Italy or McLaren in England , but for all other Formula One teams , it is a case of playing catch - up or paying prices at a premium , particularly when it comes to recruitment and supply .
The Formula One calendar is now based at least 50 percent outside Europe .
Never has the sport been so “ global . ”
By basing ourselves in the United States , we would have the “ pick of the bunch ” from all the key suppliers , most of whom have been a part of Anderson ’s world for the past 20 years .
As a national team , we would start from a unique marketing base .
We would plan to race American drivers in the medium term and to build a conduit for them , from grassroots racing to Formula One .
The large majority of our staff would be American .
We would give talented American engineers and technicians a chance to work on a world stage to which they have not had access in recent decades .
On the car ’s nose would be marked , “ Made in America . ”
From the start , we had no doubts about the technical base of the team .
The obvious first move was to base it near the Windshear tunnel .
We found a building with not a little motor sports history : the original “ Hall of Fame ” race team ’s headquarters , where such Nascar stars as Kyle Busch started their careers .
The logistics , of course , were another matter .
We would have to pay for all the travel to and from Europe , but , even so , the figures made sense .
We could have our cars and team personnel back in Charlotte after a race like the Spanish Grand Prix faster than the average British - based team would have its trucks back in England , and for virtually no increase in cost .
We would join the other Formula One teams for the “ flyaway ” race logistics — and we would treat the European double - headers just like any other team :
We would simply truck our cars to the next race .
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - A decision by the U.S. attorney general to probe deeper into alleged CIA abuse of captured terrorism suspects may not land anyone in jail , and it could just produce more headaches for President Barack Obama who wants to move on .
The logo of the U.S. Central Intelligence Agency is shown in the lobby of the CIA headquarters in Langley , Virginia March 3 , 2005 .

A report issued by the Central Intelligence Agency ’s inspector general this week offered a possible road map for building cases .
It gave graphic details about interrogations going beyond approved techniques , recounting threats to kill prisoners ’ families , a fake execution , a use of a power drill to scare a prisoner and the fact that accused September 11 mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was “ waterboarded ” 183 times .
But legal experts say special prosecutor John Durham , named by Attorney General Eric Holder to lead the investigation , will face high hurdles to sending anyone to jail .
“ I think it ’s going to be pretty challenging because if you look at the torture statute it is very narrowly drafted , ” said Thomas McDonnell , a law professor at Pace University in New York .
“ Even using the drill as a threat , according to the torture statute , there was no physical harm so there has to be severe mental harm .
But the statute then defines as it having to be prolonged mental harm , ” he said .
“ So unless you can show that it produced severe and long mental harm , it may not even fit . ”
The American Civil Liberties Union sued for the CIA report to be made public in the hopes of showing that the Bush administration engaged in torture to coerce information from terrorism suspects in violation of U.S. and international law .
The group has pushed for the prosecution of interrogators and those who authorized the techniques .
But regardless of whether charges are filed or not , Obama will likely face criticism from more liberal Democratic supporters who want former Bush officials prosecuted .
Republicans , including former Vice President Dick Cheney , have criticized the investigation as undermining national security .
POLITICAL HEADACHE AHEAD
“ It ’s almost a no - win , ” said Larry Sabato , a political science professor at the University of Virginia .
“ This is bound to be a moderate - sized to massive controversy depending on what the recommendations are . ”
He said that when Obama was trying to push through his top legislative priorities like overhauling the $ 2.5 trillion healthcare system , “ you do n’t need additional controversies . ”
Another legal complication in the prisoner abuse cases is that some of the interrogations were done outside the United States , and many were done years ago which raises questions of whether they can still be prosecuted .
Glen Donath , a former federal prosecutor and now a partner at the law firm Sonnenschein Nath and Rosenthal , said that the prisoners would also have a motive to complain after being held for so long under such conditions .
“ All of these things would be firing off against wanting to prosecute this unless the evidence was compelling , ” Donath said , adding that it would have to be along the lines of an interrogator trying to kill someone or trying to inflict harm “ with no motive of gathering intelligence . ”
ALCU officials counter that there is a mountain of evidence that U.S. government agents used torture methods and there should be prosecutions .
“ These are heavily documented crimes ... there are tens of thousands of pages that have been produced related to the CIA ’s rendition , detention and interrogation program and it ’s not a context in which there are disputes about crucial facts , ” said Jameel Jaffer , director of ACLU ’s National Security Project .
One of the biggest hurdles Durham likely faces is that Bush Justice Department lawyers wrote lengthy memos authorizing the CIA to use coercive techniques .
Interrogators could use those memos as a defense .
The ACLU has also called for prosecuting the attorneys who offered extensive legal backing for the techniques , Steven Bradbury , Jay Bybee and John Yoo .
But that too poses problems for Durham .
“ I think it ’s pretty much close to impossible to prove that in their minds and heart of hearts they understood that the law provided otherwise but they were just doing what their masters wanted , ” Donath said .
Universal health insurance is on the American policy agenda for the fifth time since World War II .
In the 1960s , the U.S. chose public coverage for only the elderly and the very poor , while Canada opted for a universal program for hospitals and physicians ’ services .
As a policy analyst , I know there are lessons to be learned from studying the effect of different approaches in similar jurisdictions .
But , as a Canadian with lots of American friends and relatives , I am saddened that Americans seem incapable of learning them .
Our countries are joined at the hip .
We peacefully share a continent , a British heritage of representative government and now ownership of GM .
And , until 50 years ago , we had similar health systems , healthcare costs and vital statistics .
The U.S. ’ and Canada ’s different health insurance decisions make up the world ’s largest health policy experiment .
And the results ?
On coverage , all Canadians have insurance for hospital and physician services .
There are no deductibles or co-pays .
Most provinces also provide coverage for programs for home care , long - term care , pharmaceuticals and durable medical equipment , although there are co-pays .
Advertisement
On the U.S. side , 46 million people have no insurance , millions are underinsured and healthcare bills bankrupt more than 1 million Americans every year .
Lesson No. 1 : A single - payer system would eliminate most U.S. coverage problems .
On costs , Canada spends 10 % of its economy on healthcare ; the U.S. spends 16 % .
The extra 6 % of GDP amounts to more than $ 800 billion per year .
The spending gap between the two nations is almost entirely because of higher overhead .
Canadians do n’t need thousands of actuaries to set premiums or thousands of lawyers to deny care .
Even the U.S. Medicare program has 80 % to 90 % lower administrative costs than private Medicare Advantage policies .
And providers and suppliers can’t charge as much when they have to deal with a single payer .
Lessons No. 2 and 3 : Single - payer systems reduce duplicative administrative costs and can negotiate lower prices .

Because most of the difference in spending is for non-patient care , Canadians actually get more of most services .
We see the doctor more often and take more drugs .
We even have more lung transplant surgery .
We do get less heart surgery , but not so much less that we are any more likely to die of heart attacks .
And we now live nearly three years longer , and our infant mortality is 20 % lower .
Lesson No. 4 : Single - payer plans can deliver the goods because their funding goes to services , not overhead .
The Canadian system does have its problems , and these also provide important lessons .
Notwithstanding a few well - publicized and misleading cases , Canadians needing urgent care get immediate treatment .
But we do wait too long for much elective care , including appointments with family doctors and specialists and selected surgical procedures .
We also do a poor job managing chronic disease .
However , according to the New York - based Commonwealth Fund , both the American and the Canadian systems fare badly in these areas .
In fact , an April U.S. Government Accountability Office report noted that U.S. emergency room wait times have increased , and patients who should be seen immediately are now waiting an average of 28 minutes .
The GAO has also raised concerns about two - to four - month waiting times for mammograms .

On closer examination , most of these problems have little to do with public insurance or even overall resources .
Despite the delays , the GAO said there is enough mammogram capacity .
These problems are largely caused by our shared politico - cultural barriers to quality of care .
In 19th century North America , doctors waged a campaign against quacks and snake - oil salesmen and attained a legislative monopoly on medical practice .
In return , they promised to set and enforce standards of practice .
By and large , it did n’t happen .
And perverse incentives like fee - for - service make things even worse .
Using techniques like those championed by the Boston - based Institute for Healthcare Improvement , providers can eliminate most delays .
In Hamilton , Ontario , 17 psychiatrists have linked up with 100 family doctors and 80 social workers to offer some of the world ’s best access to mental health services .
And in Toronto , simple process improvements mean you can now get your hip assessed in one week and get a new one , if you need it , within a month .
Lesson No. 5 : Canadian healthcare delivery problems have nothing to do with our single - payer system and can be fixed by re-engineering for quality .

U.S. health policy would be miles ahead if policymakers could learn these lessons .
But they seem less interested in Canada ’s , or any other nation ’s , experience than ever .
Why ?
American democracy runs on money .
Pharmaceutical and insurance companies have the fuel .
Analysts see hundreds of billions of premiums wasted on overhead that could fund care for the uninsured .
But industry executives and shareholders see bonuses and dividends .
Compounding the confusion is traditional American ignorance of what happens north of the border , which makes it easy to mislead people .
Boilerplate anti-government rhetoric does the same .
The U.S. media , legislators and even presidents have claimed that our “ socialized ” system does n’t let us choose our own doctors .
In fact , Canadians have free choice of physicians .
It ’s Americans these days who are restricted to “ in - plan ” doctors .
Unfortunately , many Americans wo n’t get to hear the straight goods because vested interests are promoting a caricature of the Canadian experience .
Since the beginning of the war , the German portable flame thrower has undergone a number of modifications .
Each successive model has represented an attempt to provide a less cumbersome weapon without decreasing its effective range .
The various models are discussed in the following paragraphs .
1. MODEL 35
The German portable flame thrower , Model 35 , which was in use at the start of the present war , is a modified version of the 1918 German flame thrower .
The fuel container is a commercial - type pressure cylinder which also holds the compressed nitrogen used to propel the jet of fuel .
Fuel ejection and ignition are controlled by a trigger lever on top of the flame gun .
This weapon weighs 79 pounds .
It has a fuel capacity of 2.6 gallons and a flame range of 25 yards .
2. MODEL 40
This so - called " Lifebuoy Type " portable flame thrower has a fuel unit consisting of two concentric ring - shaped containers , which are carried flat on the operator 's back .
The total weight of this flame thrower is 47 pounds .
Its fuel capacity is only 1.5 gallons .
The flame range is approximately the same as that of the Model 35 .
3. MODEL 41
The German portable flame thrower , Model 41 , introduced about August 1942 , and its later modification , the portable flame thrower , Model 42 , are equipped with flame guns of two different types .
The rest of the equipment is the same for both models and can be used with either type of flame gun .
Figure 1 illustrates the Model 41 , and figure 2 illustrates the Model 42 .
Fuel capacity , weight , and flame range of the two most recent models do not differ much from those of the Model 40 .
The following table supplies basic information .
Model 41 Model 42 Maximum range 25 yd 25 yd Total weight , charged approx 47 lb 40 1/2 lb Total weight , empty 32.2 lb 29 lb Fuel capacity 1 1/2 gal 1 1/2 gal Fuel pressure 368 lb/sq in 368 lb/sq in Nitrogen capacity 218 cu in 218 cu in Hydrogen capacity 28 1/2 cu in _ _ _ _ _
The flame gun of the Model 41 is the same as that used in the earlier types of German portable flame throwers .
The jet of fuel is ignited by a hydrogen flame , which itself is ignited by a battery - actuated electric device .
The hydrogen cylinder , 16 inches long and 1 1 / 2 inches in diameter , is mounted on the flame gun .
The rubber fuel hose , which has an inside diameter of approximately 1 inch , is wire - braided on the outside .
The fuel tank and the pressure cylinder , each charged with compressed nitrogen , are 13 inches long , their diameters being 7 inches and 5 inches , respectively .
Both containers are carried on the operator 's back , in a horizontal position and with the pressure cylinder placed above the fuel tank .
The fuel valve , which controls the flow of fuel to the flame gun , is so placed that the operator can rotate the hand wheel with his left hand .
The tank carrier consists of a fabric - covered quadrangular frame , fitted with two metal cradles .
Each cradle consists of a horizontal bar with a semicircular metal strip at each end .
The fuel tank and the pressure cylinder are held on the cradles by a metal band fitted with a quick - release clasp and cotter pin .
The tank carrier is provided with two shoulder straps .
4. MODEL 42
Except for the flame gun , this equipment is the same as the Model 41 .
Although shorter , the flame gun of the Model 42 is otherwise similar in appearance to that of the Model 41 .
The essential difference between the two models is in the ignition method .
In the Model 42 flame gun , the fuel jet is ignited by the flash from a blank cartridge , instead of by a hydrogen flame .
The principal parts of the flame gun are a fuel tube with a fuel - discharge valve at the rear , an ignition device , and a removable protective cover for the ignition .
The fuel - discharge valve is controlled by a trigger lever , which can be folded flat when not in use .
The protective dust cover is a steel tube , 1 1/2 inches in diameter , and constitutes the forward outside part of the flame gun .
Removal of this cover discloses the ignition device .
This consists essentially of a tubular spring - loaded cartridge magazine , mounted above , and parallel with , the fuel tube .
The breech and the firing rod cartridge - ejection mechanisms are at the forward end .
The magazine holds 10 blank 9 - mm ( 0.35 - inch ) rimless cartridges .
The normal position of the breech is such that the mouth of the cartridge is about 0.4 inch from the fuel jet and inclines at an angle to it , so that the flash is directed into the fuel jet .
The firing mechanism is operated by the same trigger lever that controls the fuel - discharge valve .
When this trigger is moved to the rear , the fuel discharge valve begins to open .
At the same time , the breech of the firing mechanism swings back into line with the magazine .
Ejection of the spent cartridge takes place , a fresh cartridge is inserted by spring pressure , and the striker pin is withdrawn , thereby allowing the breech to swing forward into an inclined position .
Percussion takes place with the fuel valve wide open .
When the trigger is released , the fuel - discharge valve closes , and the firing mechanism is again ready .
The Model 42 flame gun weighs 5 1/2 pounds , or about 2 1/2 pounds less than the Model 41 .
It is cleverly designed , but is very complex and requires a number of expensive small parts .
5. HOW THE GERMANS USE THEM
Only the engineers carry and employ flame throwers .
However , the engineers in the German army are regarded as combat troops , and engineer elements are frequently attached to small infantry units , down to the smallest assault detachments .
These elements may be anything from an engineer platoon attached to an advance guard [ 1 ] to two engineers with a flame thrower supporting a raiding party .
Flame throwers are used only against static targets , preferably in inclosed spaces .
They are used most of all against pillboxes .
In such instances the flame - throwing detachment begins the final assault on the pillbox itself by engaging the embrasures at close range after infantry detachments have cut any communication wire .
( The flame throwers usually advance to within effective range under cover of smoke or of fire from machine guns , antitank guns , or single tanks . )

( CNN ) -- Les Paul , whose innovations with the electric guitar and studio technology made him one of the most important figures in recorded music , has died , according to a statement from his publicists .
Paul was 94 .
Les Paul , whose innovations helped give rise to modern pop music , played guitar into his 90s .
Paul died in White Plains , New York , from complications of severe pneumonia , according to the statement .
Paul was a guitar and electronics mastermind whose creations -- such as multitrack recording , tape delay and the solid - body guitar that bears his name , the Gibson Les Paul -- helped give rise to modern popular music , including rock ' n ' roll .
No slouch on the guitar himself , he continued playing at clubs into his 90s despite being hampered by arthritis .
" If you only have two fingers [ to work with ] , you have to think , how will you play that chord ? " he told CNN.com in a 2002 phone interview .
" So you think of how to replace that chord with several notes , and it gives the illusion of sounding like a chord . "
iReport.com : Do you play a Les Paul guitar ?
Guitarists mourned the loss Thursday .
" Les Paul was truly a ' one of a kind . '
We owe many of his inventions that made the rock 'n roll sound of today to him , and he was the founding father of modern music , " B.B. King said in a statement .
" This is a huge loss to the music community and the world .
I am honored to have known him . "
Joe Satriani said in a statement : " Les Paul set a standard for musicianship and innovation that remains unsurpassed .
He was the original guitar hero and the kindest of souls .
Last October
I joined him onstage at the Iridium club in [ New York ] , and he was still shredding .
He was and still is an inspiration to us all . "
In a statement , Slash said , " Les Paul was a shining example of how full one 's life can be ; he was so vibrant and full of positive energy . "

Lester William Polfuss was born in Waukesha , Wisconsin , on June 9 , 1915 .
Even as a child he showed an aptitude for tinkering , taking apart electric appliances to see what made them tick .
Watch Paul dazzle on his guitar »
" I had to build it , make it and perfect it , " Paul said in 2002 .
He was nicknamed the " Wizard of Waukesha . "
In the 1930s and ' 40s , he played with the bandleader Fred Waring and several big band singers , including Bing Crosby , Frank Sinatra and the Andrews Sisters , as well as with his own Les Paul Trio .
In the early 1950s , he had a handful of huge hits with his then - wife , Mary Ford , such as " How High the Moon " and " Vaya Con Dios . "
His guitar style , heavily influenced by jazzman Django Reinhardt , featured lightning - quick runs and double - time rhythms .
In 1948 , after being involved in a severe car accident , he asked the doctor to set his arm permanently in a guitar - playing position .
Paul also credited Crosby for teaching him about timing , phrasing and preparation .
Crosby " did n't say it , he did it -- one time only .
Unless he blew the lyrics , he did one take . "
Paul never stopped tinkering with electronics , and after Crosby gave him an early audiotape recorder , Paul went to work changing it .
It eventually led to multitrack recording ; on Paul and Ford 's hits , he plays many of the guitar parts , and Ford harmonizes with herself .
Multitrack recording is now the industry standard .
But Paul likely will be best remembered for the Gibson Les Paul , a variation on the solid - body guitar he built in the early 1940s -- " The Log " -- and offered to the guitar company .
" For 10 years , I was a laugh , " he told CNN in an interview .
" [ But I ] kept pounding at them and pounding at them saying hey , here 's where it 's at .
Here 's where tomorrow , this is it .
You can drown out anybody with it .
And you can make all these different sounds that you can't do with a regular guitar . "
Gibson , spurred by rival Fender , finally took Paul up on his offer and introduced the model in 1952 .
It has since become the go - to guitar for such performers as Jimmy Page .
" The world has lost a truly innovative and exceptional human being today .
I cannot imagine life without Les Paul , " said Henry Juszkiewicz , chairman and CEO of Gibson Guitar , in a statement .
" He would walk into a room and put a smile on anyone 's face .
His musical charm was extraordinary and his techniques unmatched anywhere in the world . "
Paul is enshrined in the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame , the Grammy Hall of Fame , the Inventors Hall of Fame and the Songwriters Hall of Fame .
He is survived by three sons , a daughter , five grandchildren and five great - grandchildren .
Until recently he had a standing gig at New York 's Iridium Jazz Club , where he would play with a who 's who of famed musicians .
He admired the places guitarists and engineers took his inventions , but he said there was nothing to replace good , old - fashioned elbow grease and soul .
" I learned a long time ago that one note can go a long way if it's the right one , " he said in 2002 , " and it will probably whip the guy with 20 notes . "

A DJ has been sacked as a judge on television 's Australian Idol and his radio job is in jeopardy after an on - air stunt resulted in a teenage girl revealing she had been raped .
Australia 's Network
Ten announced yesterday that Kyle Sandilands would no longer work with the TV talent show , which he had judged for four years .
Sandilands has been under fire since last Wednesday , when on his popular morning radio program , The Kyle and Jackie O Show , a 14 - year - old girl was hooked up to a lie detector and asked about her sexual history , at her mother 's request .
When the girl revealed she had been raped when she was 12 , Sandilands responded , " Is that the only experience you 've had ? "
Sandilands ' reaction to the girl 's admission caused an immediate furore that led to him issuing several apologies to the girl and to the public .

From 1918 until 1933 Germany had a democratic constitution .
It had very high standards when it came to personal liberties and free speech , even if the words were wielded to harm and ultimately destroy the first functioning Republic in Germany .
Enemies of any democratic order started to throw doubts on the legitimacy of the Government right at the beginning .
Eschewing policy discussions , they used taunts , false allegations and ridicule to demean the Republic ’s representatives , institutions and symbols , thus shattering the already weak support for the Republic .
Add to that the economic woes of the 1930 ’s and you see the foundation for the dictatorship that followed and the loss of any civil liberties Germans has had before .
What I have seen in your blogs and newspapers lately leaves me concerned for the prospects of the Obama Presidency .
It is not mainly the ever loonier ravings of the clueless .
There are absolutely inane and insane claims out there , from the birth certificate to the death panels to the indoctrination of your children .
Some of the screaming mob of the right are hardly eloquent enough to order a one course meal in one sentence .
Some are more than a few cards shy of a full deck , like Glenn Beck or Ann Coulter .
Their pathetic appearances tend to make us cringe or laugh or both .
However , we should never underestimate the power of their vile propaganda .
Grain by grain the very fabric of your President ’s standing will erode .
All criticism from the right aims at discrediting the person and not his policies , thereby destroying the trust in the office of President .
What concerns me most is the institutionalized disrespect for your President .
The heckling during President Obama ’s speech is only one indication for that .
Officials from Congressmen to school district supervisors are working hard to show that they neither respect Barack Obama as a President nor respect him as a man .
They pick up the blathering of the crazies and disguise it in a more acceptable language to be made more palatable for the middle classes .
Let us not , due to intellectual disdain for the clearly anti-intellectual , underestimate the danger they pose .
Many German intellectuals did it during the Weimar Republic and paid a very high price for it .
Just sayin’ .

Chinese researchers are poised to find out for sure whether gravity fluctuates during a total eclipse ( Image : Sean Mahoney / Rex Features )
From remote observatories on the Tibetan plateau to a cave in a Shanghai suburb , Chinese researchers are poised to conduct an audacious once - in - a- century experiment .
The plan is to test a controversial theory : the possibility that gravity drops slightly during a total eclipse .
Geophysicists from the Chinese Academy of Sciences are preparing an unprecedented array of highly sensitive instruments at six sites across the country to take gravity readings during the total eclipse due to pass over southern China on 22 July .
The results , which will be analysed in the coming months , could confirm once and for all that anomalous fluctuations observed during past eclipses are real .
“ It sounds like what is really necessary to break the uncertainty , ” says Chris Duif of Delft University of Technology in The Netherlands .
“ I ’m not really convinced the anomaly exists , but it would be revolutionary if it turned out to be true , ” he says .

Pendulum anomaly
The first sign that gravity fluctuates during an eclipse was in 1954 .
French economist and physicist Maurice Allais noticed erratic behaviour in a swinging pendulum when an eclipse passed over Paris .
Pendulums typically swing back and forth as a result of gravity and the rotation of the Earth .
At the start of the eclipse , however , the pendulum ’s swing direction shifted violently ( see diagram ) , suggesting a sudden change in gravitational pull .
Fluctuations have since been measured during around 20 total solar eclipses , but the results still remain inconclusive .
Relative doubt
Most physicists doubt the anomaly ’s existence , because it would challenge our ideas about how gravity works .
As a result , a number of conventional explanations have been suggested .
“ There could be different reasons : atmospheric changes in temperature or air pressure , people suddenly moving or not moving , or other sudden changes , ” says C. S. Unnikrishnan of Tata Institute of Fundamental Research in Mumbai , India .
However , in 2004 , Duif posted a theory online concluding that none of the suggested external factors could account for the magnitude and timing of observed anomalies ( see www.arxiv.org/abs/0408023).
Best chance
In the run up to July ’s eclipse , Chinese researchers have prepared eight gravimeters and two pendulums spread across six monitoring sites .
The team hopes that the vast distance between the sites ( roughly 3000 kilometres ( 1864 miles ) between the most easterly and westerly stations ) , as well as the number and diversity of instruments used , will eliminate the chance of instrument error or local atmospheric disturbances .
“ If our equipment operates correctly , I believe we have a chance to say the anomaly is true beyond all doubt , ” says Tang Keyun , a geophysicist at the Chinese Academy of Sciences .
The opportunity wo n’t come again soon .
At over five minutes , the event will be the longest total solar eclipse predicted for this century .
What ’s more , the event will occur when the sun is high in the sky ; a time when , according to Tang , any potential gravitational anomaly should be greatest .
I ’ve recently been looking into some JavaScript unit testing frameworks .
There are many alternatives , and while many of them seem good , very few of them actually matched my requirements :
Must be able to run tests from the commend - line
Tests should be relatively easy to write
Some alternatives
There ’s a multitude of JavaScript testing frameworks , ranging from xUnit style ones like JsUnit to more unique ones like jQunit , jsspec and such .
However , many share a major flaw :
You ca n’t run tests from the command line .
Easily that is .
Why do I want to run tests from the command - line you ask ?
Afterall , it ’s JavaScript …
Well because it ’s much simple to just hit up arrow and enter to run the testsuite , rather than having to open the browser , change the tab , change the URL and reload the page .
And not only that .
Various testing libraries that run in the browser require you to fill your tests with cruft that set up a nice HTML document , include the script files , etc. etc .
Out of the various libraries available , Berlios JsUnit , Dojo Object Harness ( D.O.H. ) and JsTestDriver seemed like the best choices to try out , as they each provided a xUnit ’ish feel and allowed command line running .
Berlios JsUnit
While this library seemed okay at first , their documentation was a bit scant .
I found some examples about tests and running them from the command line , but it seemed a bit labor intensive to load various files manually , and the examples used ActiveX FileSystemObject , so I was n’t sure whether it would be a good idea to use the library if it was n’t able to load the scripts without that …
Thus , I left the library on the “ backup plan ” position in case the two others would n’t work out .
Dojo Object Harness
D.O.H. seemed like the most complete JavaScript unit testing tool .
It had it all : Browser tests , command - line tests , even automated user - interface testing was possible with it !
That is , until I read the documentation .
The documentation that did n’t exist .
I had forgotten how poorly documented Dojo was , and was quickly reminded of it .
Now , there are some articles around the web regarding D.O.H. , and Dojo ’s site has some documentation as well .
However , I found them totally unhelpful .
Despite this , I decided to try and get the tests running , and to my surprise , the command - line test runner actually ran on the first try .
The problems started when I wanted to get my own code loaded into it and tested .
Since my code did n’t follow Dojo ’s coding style , it seemed next to impossible to get the test runner to figure out where the files were and how to load them .
While the Dojo testing library seems very good , I gave up after a few hours of fighting it and trying to figure out what ’s wrong by reading their source code .
As usual , nobody on Dojo ’s IRC channel had any idea why it did n’t work .
Free tip :
Are you making a code library ?
Do you want it to be popular and widely adopted ?
Write .
Good .
Docs .
JsTestDriver
This was the late - comer to my testing framework list .
I randomly spotted it on Miško Hevery ’s blog , which is something you must read if you have n’t heard of him .
Full of excellent advice on making code testable and various best practices type things .
JsTestDriver seems to be a tool written by Miško and some others , and while it looks simpler than some other alternatives , this is the tool I went with .
Why is JsTestDriver better than the others available ?
It ’s almost perfect , that ’s why .
First , it does n’t get much easier than this to do JavaScript testing , as the tool is very easy to configure .
You do n’t need to manually load the script files you are testing , or your unit test files .
JsTestDriver takes care of it for you .
Second , it runs on the command - line perfectly fine .
Third , you can run tests in multiple browsers at once .
But I said I did n’t want to run tests in browsers .
Yes , I do n’t want to manually go into the browser and refresh the page to run the tests .
The great part about JsTestDriver is that I can open a new tab in the browser , navigate to JsTestDriver ’s URL ( it has a small server that you run ) , and simply make the tab a “ slave ” for testing .
After this , I can just forget the browser or use its other tabs for whatever else I want .
When I want to run the tests , I simply run the JsTestDriver test runner and it runs my tests in the slave - tab , displaying the results in the command - line .
In closing
So while there are many alternatives if you ’re not picky about things like command - line running , you ’re hopelessly out of luck if you are .
I ’m glad I managed to spot JsTestDriver since it ’s a great tool , but seems it is n’t very widely known .
For great comparisons of various JS unit testing frameworks , I recommend visiting James Carr ’s blog .
He has written comparisons about many of JS testing tools , and is planning on writing even more .
Have you tried using unit testing tools with JavaScript ?
I ’m interested in hearing your experiences , especially if you managed to get Dojo ’s tool to run command - line tests for code not written in Dojo - style .
In the days ahead , managers and employees of the Hyatt hotel chain will be doing favors for some of their customers .
Maybe they always did them , but these favors will be different : they will be what Hyatt Hotels ’ C.E.O. , Mark Hoplamazian , has called “ random acts of generosity , ” like unexpectedly picking up the tab for your hotel - bar drinks or hotel - spa massage .
“ Random ” seems slightly off as a description , in that Hoplamazian announced this pending outburst of hospitality , and the months of consumer research that preceded it , in a guest post on a USA Today business - travel blog .
But the idea is that the unexpected nature of the gifts will leave the customer not just pleased but also grateful .
Gratitude is a powerful , and potentially quite profitable , emotion to inspire .
A coming paper in the Journal of Marketing addresses that very subject .
Building on past research on the role of gratitude in human relationships , it argues that a customer who is made to feel grateful most likely becomes enduringly loyal as a result .
Gratitude , as the paper bluntly puts it , can “ increase purchase intentions , sales growth and share of wallet . ”
Robert Palmatier , an associate professor of marketing at the University of Washington and an author of the paper , says that making a customer feel truly grateful toward a business is harder than it might sound .
And the hard - wired feelings of reciprocity that can trigger gratitude can just as easily trigger the sense that you ’re being treated unfairly .
The most familiar form of “ relationship marketing ” ( that subset of selling tactics that revolve around maintaining repeat business from regular customers ) is probably the so - called loyalty program .
Frequent - flier miles , for instance .
Hyatt , like many big hotel chains , already has such a program : Hyatt Gold Passport members who rack up enough “ points ” by staying at its properties can get a free night in a hotel .
Nobody feels gratitude in this setup ; in fact , points and miles are invariably referred to as something you earn .
Image Credit ... Evan Sung for The New York Times ( top )
While Palmatier says there has been a lot of research on the psychology of gratitude in the past five or six years , he points to an older study that ’s now considered a classic .
Participants waiting for an experiment to begin were treated in one of two ways :
Some were unexpectedly given a soft drink by an assistant posing as another participant , and others were not .
This seemed like an act of pure generosity on the part of a fellow participant , but it was actually part of the experiment .
When the same assistant later asked subjects to buy raffle tickets , those who had been given a soda were far more likely to do so — and on average bought twice as many tickets as those who did n’t get a soda .
This says something about the human animal , and Palmatier adds that other studies have found that we feel pleasure from reciprocating out of gratitude , and guilt when we do n’t .
This , he adds , is something a business can use to its advantage or , depending on how you look at it , exploit .
Neonicotinoid Insecticides Trigger Neurodegeneration and Can Blind Insects at Low Doses ( Beyond Pesticides , September 30 , 2020 ) Low doses of neonicotinoid ( neonic ) insecticides are known to disrupt insect learning and behavior , but new science is providing a better understanding of how these effects manifest at a cellular level .
Published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , this study finds that the neonic imidacloprid binds to brain receptors , triggering oxidative stress , reducing energy levels , and causing neurodegeneration .
“ Although many studies have shown that low doses of insecticides can affect insect behavior , they have not uncovered whether insecticides trigger changes at the cellular and molecular levels , ” said lead author Felipe Martelli , PhD , of Monash University in Melbourne , Australia .
“ The goal of this work was to have a better understanding of the effects of low doses of the common insecticide imidacloprid at the cellular , physiological and behavioral levels . ”
Researchers used the fruit fly Drosophilia melanogaster , a common experimental organism , as it contains a number of nicotinic acetylchloline receptors , the primary site of action for imidaclorpid .
The neonic binds to these receptors , which regulate a number of physiological processes , such muscle contraction .
Binding closes these channels , leading to the range of harm researchers observed through their study .

Biological Management Has Added Billions in Benefits to Agricultural Economies ( Beyond Pesticides , September 29 , 2020 ) While the green revolution is often heralded in conventional agriculture circles as the key agricultural innovation of the last century , new research finds that biological controls likely had a bigger beneficial impact on world crop production .
The study , Ecological Pest Control Fortifies Agricultural Growth in Asia–Pacific Economies , published in Nature Ecology and Evolution , makes the case that the introduction of predators to manage non-native pest species was just as important as the introduction of new cereal grain varieties .
“ Our work constitutes an empirical demonstration of how insect biological control helped solidify the agrarian foundation of several Asia - Pacific economies and , in doing so , places biological control on an equal footing with other biological innovations such as Green Revolution germplasm , ” said study co-author Michael Furlong , PhD , of the University of Queensland , Australia .
The study , focusing in on the Asia - Pacific region between 1918 - 2018 , relied primarily on the BIOCAT database , a record cataloging “ classical biological control ” introductions .
Of 252 unique interventions reviewed within individual countries , pest predators established themselves in 96 .

Tell USDA to Strengthen Organic Enforcement and Allow More Time for Public Comment ( Beyond Pesticides , September 28 , 2020 ) These comments are due by October 5 at 11:59 pm EDT .
Separate comments to the National Organic Standards Board are due October 1 at 11:59 EDT .
After hearing for years about inadequate enforcement of the rules governing organic production , USDA has issued a massive draft rule on strengthening organic enforcement ( SOE ) .
The draft rule presented to the public constitutes an impressive and far - reaching rewrite of the regulations implementing the Organic Foods Production Act ( OFPA ) .
However , unlike the process by which the initial regulations were established in 2002 , the National Organic Standards Board ( NOSB ) was only consulted on a portion of the elements in this draft rule .
Public engagement was , thus , also limited .
USDA ’s National Organic Program ( NOP ) is accepting comments on its draft rule via Regulations.gov .
Please use this opportunity to remind USDA of the proper public process while commenting on the proposed rule itself .
Please join us in asking for an extension of the pubic comment to facilitate fuller public scrutiny .
Tell USDA that strengthening organic enforcement starts with the National Organic Standards Board .
USDA must involve the NOSB and public as required by law .

Where Do Pesticides Banned in Europe Go? Mostly to Poorer Countries , While Two - Thirds of Those Sent to Richer Counties Head for the U.S. ( Beyond Pesticides , September 25 , 2020 ) An investigation has revealed that companies in the United Kingdom ( UK ) , as well as in some European Union ( EU ) countries , are exporting massive amounts of pesticides — banned in their own jurisdictions — to poorer countries .
More than 89,000 ( U.S. ) tons of such pesticides were exported in 2018 , largely to countries where toxic pesticide use poses the greatest risks .
The UK has been the largest exporter ( 15,000 + tons , or 40 % of the total in 2018 ) ; other significant exporters include the Netherlands , France , Spain , German , Switzerland , and Belgium .
Among the countries receiving the bulk of these dangerous pesticides are Brazil , South Africa , Mexico , Indonesia , and Ukraine .
Despite a flurry of attention to this problem in the U.S. in the early 2000s , little has changed , worldwide , to stop this practice of selling domestically banned pesticide products to parts of the world that continue to allow their use .
This is an unethical practice that compounds the risks to workers in developing countries , who already endure heighted threats to health and local ecosystems .
The investigation was conducted by Unearthed , a Greenpeace UK journalism arm , and Public Eye , a Swiss NGO ( non-governmental organization ) that investigates human rights . . .

U.S. Geological Survey Finds Mixtures of Pesticides Are Widespread in U.S. Rivers and Streams ( Beyond Pesticides , September 24 , 2020 ) A new report by the U.S. Geological Survey ( USGS ) , National Water - Quality Assessment ( NAWQA ) Project , reveals the presence of pesticides is widespread in U.S. rivers and streams , with over almost 90 percent of water samples containing at least five or more different pesticides .
Pesticide contamination in waterways is historically commonplace as a 1998 USGS analysis revealed pesticides are commonly found in all U.S. waterways , with at least one pesticide detectable .
Thousands of tons of pesticides enter rivers and streams around the U.S. from agricultural and nonagricultural sources , which contaminate essential drinking water sources , such as surface water and groundwater .
As the number of pesticides in waterways increases , it has detrimental impacts on aquatic ecosystem health , especially as some pesticides work synergistically with others to increase the severity of the effect .
Reports like these are a significant tool in determining appropriate regulatory action to protect human , animal , and environmental health .
USGS concludes , “ Identification of primary contributors to toxicity could aid efforts to improve the quality of rivers and streams to support aquatic life . ”
Water is the most abundant and important chemical compound on earth , essential to survival and the main component of all living . . .

Bayer Coordinated with U.S. Government on Pressure Campaign to Stop Thailand from Banning Glyphosate ( Beyond Pesticides , September 23 , 2020 ) Multinational agrichemical corporation Bayer coordinated with the U.S. government to pressure Thailand to drop plans to ban glyphosate use , according to documents obtained by the Center for Biological Diversity ( CBD ) .
CBD is now suing the Trump Administration after it refused to release additional documents pertaining to the pressure campaign .
The incident is the latest example of an administration that has allowed corporate interests to dictate American governmental action on toxic pesticides .
The documents reveal that the October 2019 letter that U.S. Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) Undersecretary Ted McKinney sent to Thailand ’s Prime Minister Prayuth Chan - ocha pushing back on the country ’s plan to ban glyphosate came shortly after emails Bayer sent to U.S. officials .
In September and October 2019 , Bayer ’s Jim Travis asked the U.S. to act on its behalf in defense of the company ’s glyphosate products .
Emails reveal that Mr. Travis also collected intelligence on the personal motivations of Thailand ’s deputy agriculture minister , including whether she was “ a diehard advocate of organic food ; and / or staunch environmentalist who eschews all synthetic chemical applications . ”
Reports indicate that the U.S. government brought up the issue of glyphosate during trade talks in the context . . .

EPA Reapproves Toxic Weedkiller Atrazine with Fewer Protections for Children ’s Health ( Beyond Pesticides , September 22 , 2020 ) Use of the highly hazardous , endocrine disrupting weed killer atrazine is likely to expand following a decision made earlier this month by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency ( EPA ) .
Under the guise of “ regulatory certainty , ” the agency is reapproving use of this notorious herbicide , as well as its cousins simazine and propazine in the triazine family of chemicals , with fewer safeguards for public health , particularly young children .
Advocates are incensed by the decision and vow to continue to put pressure on the agency .
“ Use of this extremely dangerous pesticide should be banned , not expanded , ” Nathan Donley , PhD , a senior scientist at the Center for Biological Diversity said in a press release .
“ This disgusting decision directly endangers the health of millions of Americans . ”
Beyond Pesticides has long argued against the continued use of the triazine herbicides , which includes atrazine .
Triazines are well known to interfere with the body ’s endocrine , or hormonal system .
Disruptions within this delicately balanced process in the body can result in a range of ill health effects , including cancer , reproductive dysfunction , and developmental harm .
These weedkillers interfere with the pituitary gland ’s release of luteinizing hormones , which regulate the function of female ovaries and male gonads .

Please Submit Comments : Organic Can Prevent Ecological Collapse with Our Help ( Beyond Pesticides , September 21 , 2020 ) The National Organic Standards Board ( NOSB ) meets online October 28 - 30 to debate issues — after hearing public comment October 20 and 22 — concerning how organic food is produced .
Written comments are due October 1 .
They must be submitted through Regulations.gov .
Everywhere we look , we see signs of ecological collapse — wildfires , the insect apocalypse , crashing populations of marine organisms , organisms large and small entangled in plastic , more and more species at risk , rising global temperatures , unusual weather patterns , horrific storms , and pandemics .
As we focus on one of the most blatant examples of environmental abuse — the dispersal of toxic chemicals across the landscape — it is important to seek a solution .
Organic can be a big part of the solution , but only if it does n’t stray from its core values and practices .
Tell the National Organic Standards Board to support core organic values .
From its very beginnings , the organic sector has been driven by an alliance of farmers and consumers who defined the organic standards as a holistic approach to protecting health and the environment , with a deep conviction that food production could operate in sync with nature and be mindful of its interrelationship with the natural . . .

Consumer Reports Study Rates Foods with Pesticide Residues ; Does n’t Include Worker , Environmental Justice , Biodiversity Impacts ( Beyond Pesticides , September 18 , 2020 ) In late August , Consumer Reports magazine ( CR ) issued a report titled , “ Stop Eating Pesticides , ” which offers consumers a rating system CR developed and employed to help them “ get the health benefits from fruits and vegetables while minimizing [ the ] risk from toxic chemicals . ”
In addition to providing its analysis and ratings of the pesticide risk of a variety of produce items , CR recommends eating organically grown and raised foods whenever possible .
It also makes a host of recommendations on federal pesticide policies and emphasizes the importance of maintaining the integrity of the National Organic Standards ( of the USDA - housed National Organic Program ) .
Beyond Pesticides appreciates that this mainstream publication has arrived at many shared , science - based assessments of the risks of pesticides .
That said , a wholesale transition to organic and regenerative agriculture — rather than making the public figure out which fruits and vegetables are “ safer ” or “ less safe ” — is the real answer to the health risks of pesticides in the food supply , according to Beyond Pesticides .
The CR analysis used data from the U.S. Department of Agriculture ’s ( USDA ’s ) Pesticide Data Program for 2014 –2018 .
Those pesticide residue data were compiled from tests of . . .

Fashion Killer : Report Finds that the Apparel Industry is a Major Contributor to Biodiversity Loss ( Beyond Pesticides , September 17 , 2020 ) The apparel industry becomes the latest contributor to global biodiversity loss , directly linking soil degradation , natural ecosystems destruction , and environmental pollution with apparel supply chains , according to the report , “ Biodiversity :
The next frontier in sustainable fashion , ” by McKinsey & Company .
Although there are many studies on the fashion industry ’s impact on climate change , much less research discusses the impact the industry has on biodiversity .
The globe is currently going through the Holocene Extinction , Earth ’s 6th mass extinction , with one million species of plants and animals at risk of extinction .
With the increasing rate of biodiversity loss , advocates say it is essential for government agencies to hold the fashion industry accountable for the direct ( i.e. , excessive agrochemical use , water consumption ) and indirect ( i.e. , water pollution from run- off ) impacts on the environment , not only to protect the well - being of animals , but humans , as well .
Researchers in the study note , “ We expect biodiversity to become an even greater concern for consumers and investors in the coming years .
Covid - 19 , instead of slowing the trend , has accelerated it — perhaps because people now understand more deeply that human and animal ecosystems are interdependent .
It ’s time for the apparel . . .

The Way Humans Alter the Environment Increases the Prevalence of Disease Carrying Mosquitoes ( Beyond Pesticides , September 16 , 2020 ) Disease carrying mosquitoes are more likely to flourish in areas being altered by human activities , according to new research published by scientists at Oregon State University .
With climate change facilitating the spread of mosquitoes into new regions throughout the world , it is critical to understand the drivers of mosquito - borne disease in order to establish effective mitigation measures .
“ People care a lot about what environment a lion needs to succeed in ; we ’ve researched that extensively .
But people do n’t do that with mosquitoes .
We do n’t understand them as a group of species and how their ecology differs between species , ” said study co-author Brianna Beechler , PhD , a disease ecologist and assistant professor of research in Oregon State University ’s Carlson College of Veterinary Medicine .
Authors of the study note that most mosquito collection occurs opportunistically , with samples taken at known mosquito breeding sites .
To better understand mosquito spatial ecology , scientists conducted paired sampling at locations inside and outside South Africa ’s Kruger National Park , the largest nature preserve in the country .
Each sample location inside the park was paired with another sample from a similar location ( in terms of landscape and climatic conditions ) . . .

Primates , Both Wild and Captive , Are Being Exposed to Toxic Pesticides and Flame Retardants ( Beyond Pesticides , September 15 , 2020 ) Both wild and captive primates are being exposed to hazardous pesticides and flame retardants , according to research published this month in the journal Environmental Science and Technology .
This is the first study to look at the threat anthropogenic ( man- made ) chemicals may present for this important order of animals .
“ We think a lot about habitat disturbance , logging , and hunting as threats to these species , while pollution has been overlooked , ” study co-author Michael Wasserman , told Environmental Health News ( EHN ) .
Scientists conducted their research by first obtaining fecal samples from three distinct primate populations : captive baboons from an Indiana zoo , wild howler monkeys from a research station in Costa Rica , and wild chimpanzees , red - tailed monkeys , and red colobus monkeys from a Ugandan national park .
Samples were then tested for a range of chemicals , including 50 pesticides , and nearly 70 flame retardants .
Scientists discovered legacy pesticides ( such as heptachlor , DDT , hexachlorohexane , chlordane , and related compounds ) in every species tested , with the highest levels found in red colobus and red- tailed monkeys .
In particular , DDT and its related compounds ( DDD and DDE ) were found to be widespread , with red colobus monkeys . . .

Ask Congress to Help Farmers of Color and Small and Medium - Sized Farms Selling in Local Food Markets ( Beyond Pesticides , September 14 , 2020 ) As Congress returns to Washington this week , it is overdue to pass critical pandemic aid for families and communities , including helping small and mid-scale farms and ranches , farmers markets , and local food businesses address the impacts of the Covid - 19 pandemic .
The Local and Regional Farmer and Market Support Act ( H.R. 8096 ) , introduced by Rep. Alma Adams of North Carolina , will help meet the needs of farmers who have been left out .
Please urge your Congressional Representative co-sponsor this bill .
While farmers struggle to feed their communities during the ongoing coronavirus pandemic , many have not received support for critical safety and technology needs .
Billions in federal aid through the Coronavirus Food Assistance Program ( CFAP ) has gone out , but failed to reach all farmers — particularly direct marketing farmers and ranchers , diversified farmers , and folks who are Black , Indigenous , and people of color .
Local and regional food enterprises have worked to supply food through farmers markets , food hubs , CSAs , and more , but have not received the support given to larger enterprises .

Black Farmers Association Sues Bayer / Monsanto for Failure to Warn on Glyphosate / Roundup Hazards and Disproportionate Risk ; Seeks Chemical ’s Removal from Market ( Beyond Pesticides , September 11 , 2020 ) In late August , the National Black Farmers Association filed suit against the chemical company Bayer / Monsanto , seeking to stop the sale of its ubiquitous , glyphosate - based herbicide , Roundup .
According to the Midwest Center for Investigative Reporting , the lawsuit argues that Black farmers are , essentially , forced to use Roundup and incur the risks of developing non-Hodgkin Lymphoma or other cancers ( or health impacts ) because of the exigencies of the pesticide and biotech industry “ grip ” on agriculture in the U.S .
The suit maintains that Bayer ( which owns Monsanto , the original manufacturer of Roundup ) knowingly failed , and continues to fail , to warn farmers adequately about the dangers of the pesticide .
In a Labor Day Daily News post , Beyond Pesticides noted that current pesticide laws result in disproportionate impacts on workers , including agricultural workers of color .
Beyond Pesticides is committed to addressing the conditions that give rise to disproportionate harm and to working in broad coalitions to correct them .
Many countries have banned use of Roundup , largely because of glyphosate ’s strong links to many health issues , including cancer , endocrine disruption , Parkinson ’s Disease , and reproductive and immunological anomalies .

Pesticides and Heavy Metals Found in Blunt ( Cigar ) Wrappers , Cellulose - Based Rolling Papers , and other Plant - based Rolling Paper Products ( Beyond Pesticides , September 10 , 2020 ) A new analysis by Science of Cannabis Laboratories Inc. ( SC Labs ) finds detectable concentrations of pesticides and heavy metals in rolling papers , with hemp / blunt wraps and cellulose - based rolling papers containing the highest levels of contaminants .
The analysis follows a SC Labs ’ finding of high levels of chlorpyrifos — a neurotoxic , organophosphate insecticide — in the rolling paper of pre-rolled cannabis , which was undergoing compliance testing .
Although the rolling paper regulations generally track standards for toxic tobacco products ( which means there is very little meaningful regulation ) , the rolling paper use with cannabis may add an addition layer of scrutiny since some statewide cannabis regulations and independent certifications adhere to stricter guidelines similar to organic practices .
Researchers note the goals of the experiment “ were to assess the exposure risks to the consumer as well as identify any potential liabilities for cannabis producers who use these products to make their pre-roll products . ”
This report , and others like it , are significant as cannabis use expands in in the U.S. and around the world , and given that one of the most popular ways to consume cannabis product is as a rolled cigarette .

California Legislature Votes to Ban Highly Hazardous Rodenticides ( Beyond Pesticides , September 9 , 2020 ) Late last month the California legislature voted to ban , with limited exceptions , the use of highly toxic rat poisons .
The California Ecosystems Protection
Act of 2020 , AB 1788 , was passed after over a year of advocacy by groups and individuals concerned about the impact of second - generation anticoagulant rodenticides ( SGAR ) on state and local wildlife .
Proponents of the legislation are advocating that lawmakers in other states follow California ’s lead by passing similar legislation .
The bill must be signed by Governor Gavin Newsom or allow the bill to become a law without his signature by September 30 , 2020 .
The legislation hones in on the use of SGARs , specifically the chemicals brodifacoum , bromadiolone , difenacoum , and difethialone , which present significant hazards to non-target wildlife .
Unlike the first generation of blood thinning rodenticides on the market ( such as chlorophacinone , warfarin , and diphacinone , which present their own hazards ) , SGARs cannot be quickly excreted by the body and can deal a lethal dose to rodents in a single feeding .
However , SGAR - poisoned rodents do not die immediately , and are often left lethargic and exposed to the elements .
This makes them easy prey for birds and mammals .

Take Action by Sept. 13 : Tell Canada to Ban Horrifically Hazardous Wood Preservative Pentachlorophenol ( Beyond Pesticides , September 8 , 2020 ) Canada should be in accordance with international treaty to eliminate persistent pollutants .
Canada is considering the elimination of one of the worst persistent pollutants — pentachlorophenol ( penta ) — that dot our landscape in utility poles and railroad ties .
This wood preservative — a cancer - causing chemical with dioxin , furans , and hexachlorobenzene that causes health and environmental degradation — has no place in society as we struggle with shared global challenges of public and worker health threats , the climate crisis , and biodiversity decline .
We have a chance to urge Canada to move ahead with a pentachlorophenol ban , joining with Mexico to show leadership in the protection of health and the environment — something the U.S. has not done .
Tell Canada to ban pentachlorophenol .
Canada ’s Pest Management Regulatory Agency ( PMRA ) is accepting comments on a proposal to ban the all uses of penta in Canada .
Comments are due September 13 .
Canada is a signatory to the Stockholm Convention on Persistent Organic Pollutants , which voted 90 - 2 to ban penta in 2015 .
The United States is not a signatory to the Stockholm Convention and still allows the use of penta on utility poles and other “ wood that is subject to decay or insect infestation , . . .

Commentary : Let ’s Do More Than Thank Workers on This Labor Day ; Let ’s Commit to Abolishing Pesticide Laws that Institutionalize Disproportionate Risk ( Beyond Pesticides , September 7 , 2020 ) On Labor Day during this coronavirus pandemic , it is especially appropriate that we thank all essential workers — but thanks are not enough .
We must redouble our efforts to eliminate the racial and economic inequities in our society that contribute to disproportionate risk to the health and well - being of workers , especially people of color .
As the commentary in New York Magazine by Sarah Jones states , “ [ T ] okens of appreciation are just that : tokens , which signal nothing deeper than gratitude .
That does n’t pay anyone ’s rent . ”
And , all our gratitude does not protect anyone ’s health .
Nobody should have to risk their health for a job .
As we as a nation recognize that systemic change is needed to fight racial and economic injustice , we are faced with questions that go to the core of our society — the distribution of wealth , a livable wage , investment in and access to education and health care , and an environment that sustains life .
It could be said that an environmental organization , like Beyond Pesticides , that works on environmental , health , and agriculture and land management issues should “ stay in its lane ” and not delve into broader issues that address our social and . . .

Pesticide Drift from Greenhouses Adversely Affects Children Living Nearby ( Beyond Pesticides , September 4 , 2020 )
When pesticide drift is investigated , it is most often drift from agricultural fields that is examined .
A new study shows that off - target drift of pesticides from greenhouses is also a reality .
This research deduced such drift of organophosphate and carbamate pesticides from crop applications done in Ecuadoran floriculture greenhouses by evaluating the acetylcholinesterase enzyme ( AChE ) activity , necessary to the transmission of nerve impulses , in children residing nearby .
The team finds that children living in homes near greenhouses in which these insecticides ( widely recognized as cholinesterase inhibitors ) are used exhibit reduced activity of this enzyme and abnormal functioning of the nervous system .
Beyond Pesticides has monitored the pesticide drift issue intensively , and has long advocated for far better protections for farmworkers .
This new information connects those issues , and expands the “ drift ” concerns to include risks to people working in greenhouses , and to those , especially children , who happen to live near greenhouse - type structures in which these toxic chemicals are used .
The study evaluates data during three separate periods ( 2008 , April 2016 , and July – October 2016 ) on 623 children , aged 4 – 17 , living in floricultural communities in Ecuador .
The research is part of the study . . .

Work - Related Exposure to Pollutants Increases the Risk of Developing Heart Defects in among Hispanic / Latinx Communities ( Beyond Pesticides , September 3 , 2020 ) Occupational exposure to pollutants including , those from wood burning , pesticides , metals , and vehicle combustion , increases the risk of developing heart abnormalities among Latinx individuals , according to new research published in the Journal of the American Heart Association .
Although previous research focuses on the impact of pollutants on human health from occupational or residential exposure , this study highlights the risk chemical exposure can have on communities , especially for those underrepresented in conventional occupational health studies , such as those with Hispanic or Latinx backgrounds .
People of color communities are already at greater risk of exposure to environmental and health harms , such as pesticide pollution , which has been identified as environmental racism .
Additionally , not only are people of color at risk of developing various , serious health issues associated with additional or cumulative pesticide exposure , they disproportionately face an elevated risk from Covid - 19 as essential workers or family members of those workers .
According to the researchers , “ The objective of this study was to assess the relationship between occupational exposure to hazardous substances and cardiac structure and function in Hispanic / Latino participants in ECHO ‐SOL ( Echocardiographic Study of Latinos ) . ”

Monarch Massacre : Hundreds of Monarch Butterflies Die After Aerial Mosquito Spraying in North Dakota ( Beyond Pesticides , September 2 , 2020 )
It ’s being called the Monarch Massacre — hundreds of monarch butterflies found dead after the Vector Control Department of Cass County , North Dakota aerially sprayed the county for mosquito control .
This incident occurred during a moment in history that is seeing monarchs at the edge of extinction , with the number of monarch butterflies overwintering in Mexico having declined 53 % from last year , according to a count conducted by World Wildlife Fund ( WWF ) Mexico .
This tragedy happened as the nation and the world are experiencing an insect apocalypse and severe biodiversity decline , threatening the web of life .
( See Study Predicts Demise of Insects within Decades if Pesticide Dependence Continues . )
While it is critical that steps be taken by communities nationwide to protect their local ecology , the incident generated a response from Cass County that claims that the insecticides used are “ the lowest toxicity products on the market for mosquito control , ” and points to the “ monarch migration [ that ] is a sporadic event that unfortunately occurred during the latest adult mosquito control application . ”
The County justifies the spraying because of nuisance mosquitoes and a finding in the “ surrounding communities ” of mosquitoes carrying West Nile virus . . .

As CBD Market Grows Exponentially , Misleading Organic Claims Abound and Group Calls for Enforcement Against Fraudulent Claims ( Beyond Pesticides , September 1 , 2020 )
In its new report , industry watchdog OrganicEye , a project of Beyond Pesticides , examines the rapidly expanding CBD market , uncovering numerous examples of gross violations flying under the radar .
In its report , Spotting the Hackers of Hemp : The Value of Authentic Certified Organic CBD Products , OrganicEye offers examples of companies claiming organic status without going through the rigorous third - party inspection and auditing process required by federal law .
As with food , organic CBD , produced from hemp / cannabis , eliminates the risks and hazards of environmentally dangerous farming practices , including the use of synthetic fertilizers , pesticides , sewage sludge , and genetically modified organisms ( GMOs ) .
Organics also shuns toxic food ingredients and food processing substances like volatile solvents .
Since Congress charged USDA with protecting organic stakeholders from fraudulent practices , illegal organic marketing claims have been the most common violations reported to the agency .
“ In addition to representing conventional hemp products as organic , marketers have engaged in illegal subterfuge , including creating their own ‘ organic ’ logos because they ca n’t use the official USDA seal and using the word ‘ organic ’ in their brand names when the products do not qualify for organic labeling , ” said Mark A.

C Title : Pregnesia
Author : Carla Cassidy
Publication Info : Harlequin 2009
ISBN : 037369413X
Genre : Romantic Suspense
The following guest review was written by SB Nonnie , who appears sporadically , mostly waving her arms in excitement and causing everyone in a 3 mile vicinity to break themselves laughing .
Without further ado : Nonnie .
26 Reasons PREGNESIA is the Best Book in the History of Pregnant Amnesiac Romance
Before I get to my list , I must say that I am no good at reviews .
I am , however , pretty good at lists , so I am going with what I know .
Besides , there are so many awesome vignettes and moments in this story , there ’s no way I could formulate all of it into a cohesive whole .
So a list it is .
It should probably go without saying that spoilers abound in this , so consider this your official warning .
Also , even though I do a pretty good summary of the plot here – take my word for it , the true glory of PREGNESIA must be experienced firsthand .
So without further ado , my top 26 reasons PREGNESIA by Carla Cassidy is the best book in the history of pregnant amnesiac romance .
#1 : The book is flipping entitled PREGNESIA .
PREG - EFFING -NESIA .
This is a level of genius previously unheard of anywhere , even at Harlequin .
Now I highly doubt Ms. Cassidy had anything to do with this title – I know how they roll at Harlequin – and yet she had the grace , the wisdom , and the awesomeness to embrace it .
Or at least not to bitch and cry to the internets with it .
Kudos to you , Ms. Cassidy .
# 2 : The hero of this book , Lucas , is a former Navy SEAL , who , along with 2 other former Navy SEALs , opened a repo company called Recovery , Inc .
At first glance , this seems rather …lame .
But this is no normal repo agency , bitches .
They repo airplanes , yachts , and mother - effing PEOPLE ( from terrorists ) , yo .
They are a serious bizness repo agency .
Navy SEAL style .
I would have known this had I read the first two books in this series , but as they were entitled INTERROGATING THE BRIDE and HEIRESS RECON instead of , I do n’t know , SHEIKTASIA and COWBOYTOPIA , I did n’t read them .
This book stands alone well enough though , and since from what I can gather it seems the heroine of book two was a tragically misunderstood Paris Hilton - heiress type , it ’s probably for the best .
# 3 : The heroine of this story is pregnant .
And she has amnesia .
A pregnant amnesiac .
YES .
She has taken shelter in a car the hero is repossessing .
But do n’t worry , the hero is quick to assure the bloody and battered heroine he is n’t a skeezy repo man – he usually only repos expensive crap like planes .
And millionaires .
He is also quite quick to inform the heroine he is a former Navy SEAL .
Because simply saying he was formerly in the military would not be cocky enough .
[ PLEASE NOTE – THE REST OF THE REVIEW CAN BE A LITTLE SPOILER -Y – READ AT YOUR OWN PERIL . ]
# 4 : Despite being a former military man , Lucas is fine with not involving the police in this matter , and chooses to take “ Jane ” to his sister , who happens to be a nurse , for patching up .
Because she got her clothes bloody , the next day he takes her to the Wal - Mart to pick up some clothes and essentials .
A ( crazily ) smiling white haired old lady seems to be trailing them through the store .
Good thing she ’s nothing to worry about , huh , Lucas ?
During this trip he UNIRONICALLY points to a pale pink t- shirt emblazoned with BABY ON BOARD and tells “ Jane ” to buy it .
Party like its 1988 , Lucas !
# 5 : Leaving the Wal - Mart ahead of Lucas , “ Jane ” is almost kidnapped by two men in a dark van .
OH NOES !
It happens so fast that they are unable to get a plate number – which is actually understandable in this moment – but Lucas does spy some sort of logo in the back window of the van .
This logo is , and I shit you not with this , a triangle with an all seeing eye in the center .
This is some ALIAS bullcrap , fo’ reals !
And later , this logo is revealed to belong to a mysterious , cult - like church .
Filled with brainless criminals , apparently , because I know when I want to kidnap someone on the down - low , I hop in my van PLASTERED WITH MY CHURCH LOGO in order to do it .
# 6 : About this time , Lucas starts getting all tingly in his boy parts when he catches sight of “ Jane ” , because ladies , we all know how effing sexy an 8 months pregnant woman can be , right ?
Luckily , as the hero observes , “ Jane ” is still a sexy little piece , and the baby is simply a “ ball ” at the front of her stomach .
No heartburn , no double chin , no hemorrhoids , no waddle , no ass spread .
“ Jane ” can totes sense the heat , too .
She knows Lucas is warm for her form , and she does n’t think it is creepy .
AT ALL .
# 7 : Two chapters after unironically encouraging the heroine to buy the pink “ baby on board ” t- shirt , the heroine unironically wears it .
With some snug fittin ’ maternity jeans .
Mmmmm . Sex - AY .
The hero unironically pitches a tent .
# 8 : The hero wants to drive the heroine around where he found her to “ jiggle her memory ” .
Jiggle her memory ?
Is n’t it “ jog her memory ” ?
Or am I insane ?
Regardless , the idea of this alpha hero using the phrase “ jiggle her memory ” aloud , is AWESOME .
Also awesome ?
This phrase is used several times over the course of the book .
That ’s an awful lot of jiggling .
# 9 : After a long day of tracking clues to “ Jane ’s ” past , Lucas kisses her and understandably freaks out .
“ Jane ” encourages him to offer her more sweet lovin ’ , but he ( very reasonably ) points out that she more than likely has a man in her life , judging by her advanced state of baby making .
She blithely replies that she has a feeling she was alone with this , and that she just “ knows ” that there ’s no one in her life .
Because a woman suffering from amnesia always knows what her relationship status is , and can be trusted when she theorizes upon it .
# 10 : Lucas returns home that evening to discover his apartment has been searched .
He knows it ’s only a matter of time before they track Jane to his sister ’s apartment and decides to get her out of there .
As she packs her stuff to leave , Lucas ’s sister wisely asks if she may be in danger and Lucas is all “ Naw .
They were obviously trying to be stealthy when they searched mah place .
YOU’LL BE ALL RIGHT . ” OMGWTFBBQ !!ELEVENTY !!11 !!1! Seriously ?
The amnesiac pregnant woman rates a trip to a safe house , but your own sister can deal with people willing to publicly kidnap and break and enter to trace her .
YOU .
ARE .
AWESOME .
Also , why not call the police and report the break in ?
“ Jane ” never stayed at his apartment , so the cops would n’t need to know about her , and this was a chance to have people dust for prints , etc .
# 11 : Lucas wants no long term connections ( excepting his younger sister , who was his lone support as a child ) because his father beat him , and his mother actively let it happen .
He does n’t want to be a father , for fear of repeating his past .
This seems pretty reasonable to me , but as he ’s already more than half in love with Prego McMemory - Loss , he ’s going to have to get over it quick .
# 12 : A few days after retreating to the “ safe house ” Lucas leaves “ Jane ” alone ALL DAY in order to run some errands .
No other precautions have been taken , other than locking the door .
He used his same ( traceable ) car the entire time they were at the house , and had it parked in front .
Those Navy SEALs .
Always stealthy , always planning ahead .
He does at least finally verify his sister is still alive .
So that ’s one thing , I guess .
Sister helps point out that should someone come forward to claim “ Jane ” , perhaps she should n’t go with them , seeing as how she was bloody , battered , and fleeing when Lucas encountered her .
Lucas ’s sister is awesome .
Lucas is unhappy to be slapped in the face with common sense , and chooses to ignore it .
# 13 : Lucas finally starts to take things somewhat seriously , yay !
After gaining a tail , shaking it , and returning to the safehouse , he parks the car in the garage ( FINALLY ) , and arranges for a rental car ( DOUBLE FINALLY ) .
Better late than never , I guess .
# 14 : Also , “ Jane ” has a morbid fear of getting the police involved in any of this .
Lucas knows this , and yet , since he is “ buddies ” with the Chief of Police he has already enquired about missing pregnant women and asked him to run the license plate number of one of his tails .
Additionally , the Chief is one of only 8 people that know the location of the safe house .
I am placing my bets now .
Chances that his buddy the Chief is NOT involved in this in any way , shape , or form ?
Approximately 0.0 % ( Having now finished the book , I was pleasantly surprised and totally wrong about this .
Way to make me guess , Ms. Cassidy ! )
# 15 : “ Jane ” has a totally understandable pity party because it ’s been a week and no one has reported her missing .
Although , since she is being chased by maniacs , why would she want to take the chance on someone who reported her missing ?
Whatever , it ’s the hormones !
And her aching back .
Because she has a constant backache because she is mega- preggers .
Lucas gives her a tender back rub .
And pops a tent while doing it , of course .
# 16 : I like this heroine !
She is totes putting the moves on Lucas .
He ’s adorably awkward and all “ you ’re preggers ! ” and she ’s all “ kiss me , you fool ! ”
She is also not stupid enough to think they can have wild sexxors when she ’s in her last month of pregnancy .
So what ’s a girl to do ?
HAND JOB .
He acts like a shy debutante .
“ What are you doing ?
I do declare … Lawks - a- mercy ! ” AMAZING .
Oh , Pregnesia , where have you been all my life ?
# 17 : Things are awkward the next morning , and Lucas is in major retreat mode .
Having gotten a name from the car that was tailing him the day before , Lucas and Jane set out to see if the guy is familiar to her .
To his credit , Lucas is opposed to this boneheaded idea , but the power of the hand job has left him helpless to Jane ’s crazy logic .
Although , I must say , he quite wisely has Jane stay in the car while he confronts the guy .
Unwisely , he reveals Jane has lost her memory .
So basically , he breaks even between cleverness and stupidity .
And no knowledge is gained on his part .
But now their potential enemy knows conclusively that Jane is with him and has amnesia , so that ’s something , I guess ?
# 18 : The next day Jane is on the news .
Her real name seems to be Julie and “ concerned family members ” are looking for her .
Yay !
Good thing it finally happened after Lucas told a total stranger who was tailing him that she has amnesia and therefore can’t remember anything about people who may or may not have attacked her !
W00T !
But see , this is the genius of this book – just when someone does something totally ricockulous , they redeem themselves with cleverness .
Lucas determines that he is going to run a check on the people who reported her missing , to make sure they ’re on the up and up before they turn her in .
Yay for using your big head , Lucas !
But part of him is also super relieved she ’s leaving , because he do n’t want love and commitment , yo .
# 19 : Poor Jane / Julie !
Her husband is dead as a doornail .
Apparently he died approximately 5 minutes after the sperm reached the egg .
Only , she does n’t remember him , so that ’s cool , I guess .
I wonder if her baby stands to inherit something significant …
I wonder …
# 20 : Oh , poor Julie , poor Lucas .
They both want to stay together , yet neither one is brave enough to express their feelings !
And Julie ’s brother - in - law and his wife are there to collect her .
They seem so normal and kind .
Surely they only want what ’s best for her ?
Surely !
But where are they going ?
OH NOES !
# 21 : The All Seeing Eye has Julie , and damned if her memory does n’t wait to come back until after she is in their clutches .
God must really hate her .
Or her baby .
Or both of them .
And they wo n’t let Lucas in to see her .
And they wo n’t let the Chief of Police in either .
But they will let one particular officer in to see her .
That is n’t suspicious at all , right ?
NOPE .
NOT AT ALL .
# 22 : Okay , honestly , I cannot fully express the crazy that happens next .
Suffice it to say , it is WACKADOO .
Part of what makes PREGNESIA so awesome , I guess .
BUY THIS BOOK , GUYS .
SERIOUSLY .
CAPS LOCK SERIOUSLY .
Suffice it to say , Julie – the relatively level - headed and competent Julie – loses her ever - loving mind and fails to see a gigantic plot hole right in front of her face .
She is flipping breathtaking in her boneheadedness and inability to see the flaws in the villain ’s reasoning .
I ’m not going to lie , this part made me laugh my ass off .
In a wonderful way .
# 23 : Thank goodness Lucas and friends are ex-Navy SEALs .
Because they get their stealth on in a major way .
I would hate for that knowledge to be wasted – it ’s only a shame the villains did n’t live in an underwater fortress so they could truly use all their training .
# 24 : Hahahahaaaa !
The crazy again .
Seriously guys , the last 50 pages are such cash money gold .
I implore everyone to buy this book .
It will give you literal LOLs .
Suffice it to say , the villain wants her baybeeeeee .
BAD .
But at the same time threatens to put a bullet in her brain .
A lot .
So which does he want ?
Her baby or her corpse ?
Because I is confused .
And I think Julie is too .
# 25 : Heartfelt confession of love time !
And yay for Julie ’s initiative , although in all fairness she has known Lucas for one week , shared two kisses and a hand job .
But I guess when it ’s right , it ’s right .
Too bad Lucas is askeerd to be a husband and daddy .
DENIED .
# 26 : And now it ’s baby time !
Seriously , a book entitled PREGNESIA could not fail to deliver ( har har ) on the baby promise implicit in the title .
But will Lucas stay away ?
Will Julie be all alone ?
Um .
No and no .
Yay , Lucas , yay , Julie , yay , baby Luke !
And those are the top 26 reasons why PREGNESIA is the greatest pregnant amnesiac romance EVAH .
If you had to pin me down to a letter grade for this book , I would have to split it into two distinct grades – for actual story cohesion , plot , etc , it ’s a C .
For entertainment value ?
A+ all the way , baby .
Thank you , Carla Cassidy .
Thank you .

Lost in all the discussion about healthcare reform is the oddly American notion that our teeth are not connected to the rest of our bodies , and have nothing to do with health .
So am I surprised that 2000 people stood in line to get free dental care in America yesterday ?
Hell , no :
BRIGHTON —
The doors to a free dental clinic in Brighton opened at 5:00 this morning to a throng of anxious people .
The first person in line was Robin Kelley , 59 , of Westminster , who got in line last night at 5 p.m .
We only have one car , " she explained , " and my husband works at night , so he dropped me off . "
Like others in line , she had a blanket and camped out on the sidewalk .
" The company was warm and great , " she said .
At 6:15 organizers gave out 808 tickets for services , then ended the line because they felt that was the number of patients that could be seen today .
The free clinic continues tomorrow .
David Hathaway , 49 , of Arvada was second in line .
He is unemployed with no insurance .
He heard about the opportunity for free dental care at 3:30 Thursday afternoon and said to himself , " I gotta get out there , " he related .
This morning he has already had two root canals and expects to leave with a cleaning , as well .
This is " a godsend , " he said .
" I think it 's great what they are offering . "
Earlier this week , Molly Pereira , associate executive director of the Colorado Dental Association , had predicted " a humongous turnout .
Rep. Judy Solano , D - Brighton , sent an automated call to 20,000 constituents , letting them know about the clinic .
Solano reported that a Thornton woman called her to say , " This must be an answer to our prayers . "
The woman said her husband and son need dental treatment , but the family can't afford it because of medical bills for their child with special needs .
The two - day clinic is not taking appointments , Pereira said .
It is treating people on a first - come , first - served basis .
Dentists , dental hygienists and other medical professionals are volunteering their services for the event , called the Colorado Mission of Mercy .
It 's the first COMOM clinic in the metro area and the first since the economy slid into a recession .
" I think we are going to get patients from all walks of life , " Pereira said .
I have a lot of “ someday ” dreams .
I ’m sure you have some , too .
They ’re not “ bucket list ” type dreams – something to do once and scratch it off the list for ...
8 years ago
The phrase “ spoke on condition of anonymity ” has appeared in about 160 Washington Post stories this year , says Post ombud Andy Alexander .
Since Jan.
1 , The New York Times has used the phrase 240 times , says its public editor .
The Post knows better , Mr. Alexander writes :
The Post has strict rules on the use of anonymous sources .
They ’re spelled out in detail — more than 3,000 words — in its internal stylebook .
But some of those lofty standards are routinely ignored .
Others are unevenly applied .
Anonymous sources have their place in news gathering .
Whistleblowers who make charges of malfeasance against governments or corporations need protection against reprisal .
Victims of sexual assault similarly have been granted anonymity to protect against reprisal or demonizing .
Sources in crucial national security stories may need protection .
Sometimes , the grant of anonymity is the only way to obtain information that will serve the public interest .
“ Anonymous sources are critical to newsgathering — and to informing readers , ” writes Mr. Anderson .
“ Without a guarantee of confidentiality , many sources would n’t share sensitive information on corruption or misconduct . ”
But far too many journalists and their editors use anonymous sources routinely without more critical assessment of the consequences .
So should such journalists be surprised at the erosion of their credibility ?
You know anonymice when you see them :
• said one of the FBI agents involved with the case who spoke to The Times on condition of anonymity because the investigation is continuing .
• said a senior Pentagon official , who requested anonymity when discussing internal decision - making .
• said one Democratic strategist who spoke on condition of anonymity because the Obama campaign has banned any comments on the selection process .
• The advisers — who , along with the diplomatic official , spoke on condition of anonymity —
• a former Countrywide executive said , speaking on condition of anonymity because he had not been authorized to discuss the program .
• said the sources , who spoke on condition of anonymity because the investigation is ongoing .
• The official , who spoke on condition of anonymity because of the delicacy of the issue
• said a member of local union bargaining team , who insisted on anonymity because union officials said they would not negotiate in the news media .
• according to two sources close to the negotiations .
These anonymice were published last year in The New York Times , the Post , the Los Angeles Times or the Wall Street Journal .
Slate ’s Jack Shafer and intern Kara Hadge collected them and placed them in a database — complete with a five - point ranking system of the merit of the mice .
( Oh , it ’s fun .
Go read more of these . )
Some anonymice have merit .
Here ’s one of Mr. Shafer ’s examples from the Post :
Several EPA officials , speaking on the condition of anonymity , said that throughout the process , White House officials instructed the agency to change their calculations with the aim of reducing the “ social cost of carbon , ” a regulatory term that reflects the economic burdens stemming from greenhouse gas emissions .
Mr. Shafer rates this as creditable : “ Do n’t you love it when bureaucracies battle one another ?
This anonymouse is worth the bother . ”
His sarcasm aside , EPA officials needed protection from a White House that undercut and misrepresented the work of EPA scientists , adversely affecting public policy .
Mr. Shafer says , “ Often a journalist has no alternative to attributing his information to an anonymouse when reporting , say , a criminal investigation or from a war zone .
Likewise , many national - security stories cannot be reported without citing unnamed sources .
The NSA story , the CIA prison story , and the torture story could not have been undertaken without anonymous sources . ”
As an example of appropriate use of anonymice , he cites the Dana Priest rules .
( Ms. Priest is a national - security reporter for the Post . )
The best reporters , Mr. Shafer argues , dig for detail from anonymice :
They ’re disciplined about their use of anonymous sources , and give more credence to whistleblowers than blowhards .
They present multiple sources , increasing the likelihood that the information is accurate .
They serve their readers , not their sources ’ agendas .
And the information they publish is remarkably specific — proving dates , locations , events , circumstances , participants , quantities , and the like … [ emphasis added ]
Clark Hoyt , the Times ‘ public editor , writes that the newspaper ’s policy says anonymice should be “ a last resort when the story is of compelling public interest and the information is not available any other way . ” [ emphasis added ]
True , many stories of public interest relating to crime and national security may need anonymice .
Anonymous sources led to reporting by Lance Williams and Mark Fainaru - Wada on the BALCO steroids scandal for the San Francisco Chronicle .
( Then again , some of the sources proved a tad shady , raising some old questions about anonymice . )
The Post and most large news organizations have policies regarding use of anonymous sources .
But are they properly adhered to ?
The Times ‘ Mr. Hoyt writes that the newspaper ’s policy forbids some uses — but that does n’t prevent them from appearing in the newspaper :
The policy says the newspaper will not allow personal or partisan attacks from behind a mask of anonymity .
Yet an anonymous Yankees official could trash Alex Rodriguez ( “ His legacy , now , is gone ” ) , and an anonymous Jets official could say that the team did not want to sign Terrell Owens because he would have poisoned it and torn up the locker room .
A competitor of an Internet start - up was allowed to slam its business model without his name being attached to his belittling quotes .
[ emphasis added ]
Anonymous sources , used properly and improperly , are here to stay .
And it ’s not just traditional media anymore .
Blogs have become notorious for abuse of anonymity .
So have other social media .
So what do readers ( and viewers ; TV does it , too ) do when confronted by an anonymous source in a news story — or blog post ?
Just ask one question .
Cui bono ?
Who benefits from the anonymity ?
Slate ’s Mr. Shafer includes that information in his database .
If the perceived benefit is not for the reader , then the anonymouse is , well , probably bogus .
Over the past few years , I think the benefit of anonymice has shifted even further to the source .
Anonymice float trial balloons on policy .
They goad opponents behind anonymity .
They belittle , undercut and lie about someone or something , all to the anonymouse ’s advantage .
The advantage increasingly goes to the source because reporters and editors allow it .
So why do reporters continue to use such cunning , deceitful anonymice ?
Two reasons .
First , overwork .
There are simply fewer reporters these days .
The revenue crisis in the newspaper industry has seen thousands of reporters laid off or bought out , especially those with years , even decades , of experience .
The talent pool is shallower .
Fewer reporters with lesser experience feel the pressure to do more stories — stretching their professionalism , perhaps , too far .
Second , preservation of access .
Reporters working beats may have to use an anonymouse against their better judgment — to make sure the anonymouse does n’t shut them out of future stories .
Sometimes , the public interest is well served by use of anonymous sources .
But , as two reader representatives of major newspapers write , anonymice have become more a vice than a virtue .
Readers are the losers in this framing game .
Because of Kanye West ( about whom Sady has said most everything that need be said ) there is some current bizarre preoccupation with the " lack of decency " in America today .
As if in response , the FCC announced this week that it intended to reopen the investigation into the famous Timberlake / Jackson " wardrobe malfunction " at the 2004 Super Bowl .
Adrift in the sea of flat - out crazy and disgusting that is American public discourse lately , there was barely an eyelash aflutter at this news .
We have more pressing things to worry about , one supposes .
Fair enough .
But how shameful is it , how absolutely insane is it , that the major discussion about " standards " for broadcast television today always takes place in the context of " indecency " – and in particular , that women 's bodies are " indecent " ?
I mean , I do n't know about you , but the only think I found shocking about Janet Jackson 's breast - exposure on live television was that metal thing she had on her nipple .
Christ , would n't that hurt ?
My point is that I do n't think the half - second or so of nipplage has done nearly as much damage to " the children " ( always so undefined ) as the notion that crazy people who think Barack Obama is a secret Muslim are deserving of more than two seconds of derisive airtime on cable and network news .
Back in the day when the Super Bowl event happened we could sort of brush all this off as the craziness of living in Bush America : the inmates were running the asylum , what can one do when sanity is unrepresented in government , etc etc .
This is , happily , no longer the case , and yet , here we are , still stuck on whether the real indication that something is " desperately wrong " is that egotistical jerk artists are behaving like egotistical jerk artists .
I 'm actually no free speech absolutist – I come from another political culture , yadda yadda yadda , and I think there is value to having limits on what should and should not be okay to broadcast on national television .
I am perfectly well aware , as a feminist , that I have to be wary of state regulation , because the state is not my own – living in the world , talking to all the Men Who Explain Things ( like the First Amendment , as though its value were far too abstract and majestic for my poor lady brain to wrap itself around ) , has taught me that well enough .
I just think that if there is some value in federal broadcast regulation in an albeit imperfect democracy – and there probably is – it resides in its ability to spark national conversation about what kinds of speech are valuable and relevant , and what are not .
That is not , of course , what the FCC is doing .
The FCC wants to make some idiotic top - down ruling about the trauma inflicted on children by seeing a tit .
( Does this make all nakedness child abuse ? )
I 'd just like for this conversation about the limits of decency to center on stopping people from getting to broadcast their flat - out stupid and hateful views to millions of people .
I 'd like for it to be about building a sense that the dehumanization of entire swaths of the population is n't just contributing to the marketplace of ideas – it's mocking the very notion of ideas themselves .
It 's valuing ignorance at the expense of that marketplace , because it 's handing people megaphones who hardly deserve them .
And at the end of the day , it 's my respect for pop culture as a liberatory practice , in television as a medium in which one does learn things , that suggests to me we all have a stake in better rearranging it to promote certain public goods .
Like , you know , civic responsibility .
But then I always have been something of a dreamer .
Google 's displayed traffic information for major interstates and freeways for years , but starting today , the popular web - based mapping application adds traffic conditions for arterial roads — that is , heavily trafficked roads .
Even better :
It works with Google Maps on your cellphone .

Google Maps traffic information Google Maps has just rolled out an exciting new traffic feature , that provides traffic data for …

( Click the image above for a closer look . )
In fact , it not only displays traffic overlays for major roads on a GPS - enabled Google Maps for mobile ; if you 've got Google Maps with My Location enabled , Google crowdsources your data :
When you choose to enable Google Maps with My Location , your phone sends anonymous bits of data back to Google describing how fast you 're moving .
When we combine your speed with the speed of other phones on the road , across thousands of phones moving around a city at any given time , we can get a pretty good picture of live traffic conditions .
We continuously combine this data and send it back to you for free in the Google Maps traffic layers .
It takes almost zero effort on your part - just turn on Google Maps for mobile before starting your car - and the more people that participate , the better the resulting traffic reports get for everybody .

This is a fantastic feature ( assuming you do n't mind the anonymous usage statistics going to Google ) , and one that 's actually available in some GPS devices already .
The drawback on some devices — the iPhone , for example — is that you 'd need to use Google Maps in place of another GPS application , and since the iPhone now features turn - by - turn GPS navigation applications , it 's a bit of a sacrifice .
Still , if Google were to go the extra mile and turn Google Maps into a turn - by - turn GPS app ( something that seems well within reason , considering how much map data they 've already got ) , then they 'd really be on to something that a lot of us would potentially use .
To display traffic overlays on a map ( where available ) , simply click the Traffic button in the top right of Google Maps in your browser or find the Traffic toggle on your cellphone ( on the iPhone , you 've got a Show / Hide Traffic toggle when you tap the button in the bottom right corner ) .
Traffic information here in Los Angeles appears to cover most major roads , and though I have n't road - tested against what the traffic data shows , it looks about right for what I 'd expect this time of day .
If you give it a try , let 's hear how accurate it seems for your daily commute in the comments .

One exabyte is a billion gigabytes .
It 's one quintillion bytes .
And yes , " quintillion " is a number so large , it almost seems made - up .
But that 's how much online video will be consumed by 2017 , according to new reports from U.K. - based research firm Coda .
Actually , to be precise , they 're claiming that mobile broadband users accessing the net via laptops and netbooks will consume 1.8 exabytes of video .
Per month .
Mobile Broadband Video Forecast
In the company 's latest report ( sample ) " Mobile Broadband Traffic Across Regions 2009 - 2017 , " they 've determined that this increase will account for nearly three quarters of all global traffic via mobile broadband portables .
The top region for video consumption will be Asia Pacific which will account for over half ( 53 % ) of the traffic .
That will be followed by Europe ( 26 % ) and then North America ( 14 % ) .
The reason why Asia Pacific comes in so high is because , in many countries , mobile broadband is often the sole option for internet connectivity .
Another forecast states that two - thirds of the global traffic will be via LTE ( Long Term Evolution ) , a 4G wireless technology , where Asia Pacific will consume just under half ( 45 % ) of LTE traffic .
In Europe , 80 % of traffic will be LTE - based and in North America , 75 % .
It Will Get Worse Before it Gets Better
According to Steve Smith , founder of Coda Research Consultancy , " the sheer amount of traffic people will consume worldwide will put pressure on operator revenues and network capacity , necessitating radical efficiency drives . "
He also notes that , in the short term , end user frustration with bandwidth and speed will increase .
To illustrate this point , he mentions that today as many as three - quarters of Europeans are dissatisfied with the speeds they currently receive .
That 's an interesting comment , especially considering all the grumbling we hear about AT&T in the U.S. and their general failure to deliver on the promise of high - speed internet for iPhone users .
( In many urban areas , they can't even consistently deliver a signal ! )
Although this report did n't focus specifically on smartphones , it 's somewhat comforting to know that overseas users are experiencing the same struggles as we do here in the U.S .
However , once mobile broadband operators complete their build - outs and upgrades to this high - speed data network of the future , the resulting impact it will have on the internet as a whole will be mind - blowing .
One could even argue that bandwidth speeds have accounted for many of the major revolutions the internet has seen over time - since the invention of the hypertext protocol and the web browser , that is .
The Next Revolution for the Net : Extremely Fast , Lots of Bandwidth
In the early days , slow dial - up speeds left us with simplistic , HTML - coded web pages where the most action to be had was an animated GIF .
As bandwidth and speeds increased , pages became more robust , too .
This change led to sites like Amazon and eBay , both of which launched in 1995 , allowing people to shop from home using their PCs .
By 2001 , the usefulness of the net encouraged enough people to come online to make sites like the crowd - sourced Wikipedia possible .
By 2003 , the still - increasing speeds meant users could now download music from the newly launched iTunes store , customize ( and overload ! ) their online profiles on MySpace , and play in online virtual worlds like Second Life .
The following year , online photo - sharing prepared to go mainstream thanks to the launch of Flickr .
Facebook , too , launched this year and eventually became the largest photo - sharing site in the world only three years later when they announced how they hosted over 10 billion photos on their site .
Also in 2005 , the abundance of high - speed data connections made video - sharing site YouTube a hit among a new generation of user - generated content producers .
By 2007 , broadcasters banded together to launch Hulu , a video - streaming site for commercial content in an effort to compete with pirated peer - to - peer downloads as well as iTunes , which by now was serving up TV shows and full - length movies .
In Europe , the BBC iPlayer was doing much of the same .
In 2008 , the launch of the 3G iPhone brought the high - speed internet to the handheld and revolutionized the mobile phone industry .
This year , the handset 's hardware was upgraded to record video , too .
As you can see , many of these changes were either directly or indirectly impacted by the increasing speeds and bandwidth provided by both mobile operators and ISPs .
But currently , it 's the mobile broadband networks which having more of an impact on the latest trends .
Even with all their struggles ( cough AT&T cough ) , without the bandwidth provided , phones like the iPhone would n't even be possible and the smartphone revolution would n't be underway as it is now .
So what will the world look like by 2017 ?
It 's almost hard to imagine .
But the promise of 4G could deliver things like live streaming HDTV , real - time updates from a variety of services , video chat , abundant use of MiFi , mobile cloud computing , streaming via iTunes instead of downloading ( we like that ! ) , and much more .
In other words , the high - speed net that you use at home could go with you everywhere via your netbook , tablet , smartphone , or some other device in between .
What will that mean for the world of online applications and cloud computing ?
Only that the next big shift for the internet as a whole is underway and we 're privileged to be watching it happen now .

“ To Kill a Mockingbird ” is worth 15 points .
Librarians and teachers report that students will almost always refuse to read a book not on the Accelerated Reader list , because they wo n’t receive points .
They base their reading choices not on something they think looks interesting , but by how many points they will get .
The passion and serendipity of choosing a book at the library based on the subject or the cover or the first page is nearly gone , as well as the excitement of reading a book simply for pleasure .
This is not all the fault of Renaissance Learning , which I believe is trying to help schools encourage students to read .
Defenders of the program say the problem is n’t with Accelerated Reader itself , but with how it is often implemented , with the emphasis on point - gathering above all else .
But when I looked at Renaissance Learning ’s Web site again this summer , I noticed the tag line under the company name : “ Advanced Technology for Data - Driven Schools . ”
That constant drive for data is all too typical in the age of No Child Left Behind , helping to replace a freely discovered love of language and story with a more rigid way of reading .
Not long ago , I went back and re-reread three of my own favorite books of all time , books that made me into a writer .
They introduced me to my heroines , girls who grew up in real hardship in vibrantly rendered landscapes that I had never seen before .
Anne , in “ Anne of Green Gables , ” made me understand friendship and “ kindred spirits ” and imagination .
Francie , in “ A Tree Grows in Brooklyn , ” made me ache at the injustice of having a charming alcoholic father ( his suit drying green after he falls into the bay while fishing ) and a mother who cannot love her as much as she loves her more handsome brother .
And Nel , the quieter half of the inimitable pair of friends in “ Sula , ” made me feel the way girls love each other intensely in childhood , captured in the precise and lovely language of lines like this :
“ We were two throats and one eye and we had no price . ”
Total points for my three favorite books : 49 .
Many teachers say Accelerated Reader has increased reading among students , who like the process of collecting points and the prizes schools sometimes give to students who collect the most .
I have certainly seen the excitement at my daughter ’s former elementary school when winners were announced .
But as a writer and mother of three girls who love novels , I find the idea that we can apply a numerical formula to reading a bit insulting to literature .
I ’m not against all quantifying .
But as Renaissance Learning itself emphasizes , Accelerated Reader ’s formula cannot measure “ literary merit for individual readers . ”
It cannot consider emotion and landscape and character , and certainly can’t identify what makes even some of the simplest - seeming sentences so complex and lovely and painful .
How can we really measure this passage about Helen Burns , the companion in “ Jane Eyre ” who will shortly die of tuberculosis ? “. . . a beauty neither of fine color , nor long eyelash , nor penciled brow , but of meaning , of movement , of radiance .
Then her soul sat on her lips , and language flowed . ”
“ Jane Eyre ” is worth 33 points .
And nothing can measure how a young life can be changed by literature .
It can be a small change — like understanding more about someone from a different race or period or culture — or a complete change , as happened to me when I read the stories of Anne , Francie and Sula and decided I could be a writer , so that people would know my own world .

The Iranian authorities have been accused by UN experts and the opposition of torturing jailed protesters of the June 12 presidential election results .
Mehdi Karoubi , an opposition leader and former Speaker of Iran 's parliement , claimed that both male and female detainees have been raped in the Evin and Kahrizak prisons in Tehran , and that political prisoners are being tortured to death .
Rape and torture are not a new phenomenon in Iran 's prisons , but the recent events have focused more attention on the prisons of the Islamic Regime .
Iranian civil society activists , including Reza Allamehzadeh , a leading film director , have been using citizen media to highlight testimonies about the Iranian tragedy .
A former political prisoner recounts the experience of being imprisoned , tortured and raped in an Iranian prison in the 1980s .
She was only 17 years old at the time , and did not know why she had been arrested .
More than 84,000 people have watched her testimony on YouTube .
Kahrizak
Thousands of protesters , including some who were injured , were arrested during the July demonstrations and hundreds were sent either to prison or a torture house called Kahrizak .
Here is a testimony from one of the survivors that has been published on several blogs :
They took us with tens of others to Kahrizak camp .
At least in that room that I were held there were another 200 people , all were injured beaten by batons .
you could hear people crying everywhere ….
the plaincloth guards came into room … beat whom they could .
they did for half an hour …after that they put a flash light in our faces and say if you make a noise with put these batons in your asses … . to prevent us dying of hunger , everyday they give us a bag of leftover food .
In this interview , a survivor explains how prisoners at Kahrizak were forced to lick water from the floor .
Ayathollah Ali Khamenei , Iran 's Supreme Leader , has ordered the closure of Kahrizak .
MPs have said that 12 officers and judges were prosecuted over the Kahrizak incidents .
Beaten with a cable , no questions asked
Iran 's torture houses have been in existence for 30 years , however , and Kharizak is not the only one .
Here is another testimony from an Iranian citizen arrested and tortured at Evin prison simply for having been near the site where a demonstration took place .
Construction on what would become the world 's longest marine causeway , connecting Qatar and Bahrain , is due to begin next year , and what a project it is :
We 're talking about a bridge more than 13 miles long , costing around $ 3 billion .
Advertisement
Somewhat adorably named the Qatar - Bahrain Friendship Causeway , this massive bridge is expected to take around 4.5 years to complete and cost somewhere between $ 2.3 and $ 3 billion , but should be a great help for travel between Qatar and Bahrain .
The trip currently takes more than four hours and will be reduced to 30 minutes on the bridge , and those in charge expect 10,000 to 20,000 vehicles per day to use it .

For a sense of scale , here 's a chart that compares the bridge to other very large things .
Of course , I need a scale chart to tell how big a blue whale is , which sort of defeats the purpose of measuring this bridge in blue whales , but still :
This is one large bridge .

But , this time it 's not just her saying it !
People agree with her , totally .
In her facebook posting , Sarah Palin quotes renowned expert in the batshit arts Michelle Bachmann as a source for her concern .
Rep . Michele Bachmann highlighted the Orwellian thinking of the president 's health care advisor , Dr. Ezekiel Emanuel , the brother of the White House chief of staff , in a floor speech to the House of Representatives .
I commend her for being a voice for the most precious members of our society , our children and our seniors .
The media has a problem here of their own making .
The crazy are truly ruling the asylum over in the elephant party .
It 's either time to call their bullshit , get them the medications they deserve , or call up a witch doctor and get the evil spirits out of their body .
I would love for Trig Palin to get annual check ups , top notch health care , even if his mom is insane .
I am tolerant that way .
But I guess I do n't get to be on the death panel then .
Update : I have a special needs child and I struggle with medical insurance issues big time .
This latest offensive spew from Palin really hits home .
Is she suggesting that my support of reform can be classified as a desire for infanticide ?
She can go to hell .

Call from the National Front against the Coup d'Etat in Honduras to the worldwide working class
August 3 , 2009 -- Tegucigalpa -- June 28 of the this year when the Honduran population was preparing to participate in a popular opinion poll on ... whether or not to convoke a Constitutional Assembly , thousands of soldiers kidnapped the constitutional president of the republic , Manuel Zelaya Rosales , and they expelled him to the neighbouring country of Costa Rica ; they occupied the Presidential House ; they violently closed all of the independent radio and television stations ; they persecuted all the functionaries of the government and they implanted a state of siege in the whole country .
In that way a coup d'etat took place , which hours later was " legalised " by the National Congress ( legislative assembly ) , putting into the presidency Roberto Micheletti Bain , leader of President Zelaya 's own political party , [ using ] ridiculous arguments that the deposed president has " resigned " .
That was denied by President Zelaya himself , in addition to the fact that the National Congress does not have the constitutional authority to separate him from his role .
At the same time , it was argued that there was an order of arrest without the president having faced a judge where he could defend himself from the accusations made towards him .
Behind the coup is the business leadership , the four political parties of the bourgeoisie ( the Liberal Party , the National Party , the Christian Democratic Party and the Party of Social Democratic Innovation and Unity ) , the leadership of the Catholic and evangelical churches , as well as the main owners of the mass media .
All of them made a counter - revolutionary alliance for fear that the popular poll of the June 28 would give power to the people and especially to the working class and poor peasantry to start the construction of a new society , where the privileges of the bourgeois class and the landowners would be eliminated .
It is also necessary to say that behind this coup d'etat is the hand of North American imperialism and the Latin American ultra-right , who are seeing it as an opportunity to stop the advance of the left in the Central American region and the influence of the Venezuelan revolution , after the recent electoral triumphs of the Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front ( FMLN ) in El Salvador and the Sandinista Front in Nicaragua .
Nonetheless , the answer of the Honduran people did not wait even for the first hour of the coup .
The popular masses flooded into the streets to take over the public plazas and to protest in the Presidential House ( headquarters of the government ) against thousands of military troops , armed with tanks , helicopters , planes and heavy artillery .
Ever since , the popular masses have come out EVERY DAY to the streets for a month , to protest , to carry out pressure to defeat the usurper government , carrying out massive mobilisations , highway takeovers , takeovers of public buildings , etc. making use of Article 3 of our Political Constitution that gives the right to popular insurrection in the case of the imposition of a government by armed force .
Although this struggle has cost the lives of various Hondurans , assassinated by the military , thanks to this resistance the usurper government has not been able to control the situation , nor to defeat the masses and hence
has not been able to consolidate itself as a government .
The maximum organised expression of the popular resistance is the National Front against the Coup d'Etat , which unites all of the social and political expressions of the popular movement and is driving the national movement towards the defeat of the dictatorship .
This front is made up of workers ' , peasants ' and other people 's organisations , as well as by the left and centre parties and movements who have declared themselves against the coup d'etat .
The international reaction was forceful from a diplomatic point of view .
Except for the Zionist regime of Israel , no other country in the world dared to recognise the military - business dictatorship imposed in Honduras .
Both the Organization of American States , the United Nations General Assembly , the Río Group , the countries associated with the Bolivarian Alternative of the Americas , among others , condemned the coup d'etat , because they correctly recognise that it is about the first coup against the limited bourgeois democracies that exist in Latin America , and that , if it consolidates , would set a disastrous precedent to allow the un-doing of the social and democratic liberties that have been achieved by the peoples and workers and would probably be imitated by the most reactionary forces in other countries of the region and world .
Nonetheless , this reaction has not yet gone past the point of diplomatic declarations which , while useful , are not sufficient to hurt the dictatorship economically or militarily .
The only government that always had an ambiguous policy towards the usurping government was the United States government led by President Barack Obama .
While it declared recognition of the government of President Manuel Zelaya as the only president , it gave visas to the emissaries of the coup makers so that they could come into North American territory to lobby in favour of the coup ; it has not suspended the main programs of economic and military aid to Honduras , it has not applied a commercial boycott like it has done against Cuba , and it refuses to declare that this is a coup d'etat .
Instead it has promoted negotiations between the legitimate president of Honduras , Manuel Zelaya , with the dictator Micheletti , through a mediator , Costa Rica 's President Oscar Arias .
For the National Front Against the Coup d'Etat , the mediation of President Arias is a strategy of the US State Department to achieve some level of international recognition for the dictator Micheletti , delaying the time for the end of the conflict so that the resistance movement is worn out , and to submit President Zelaya to unacceptable conditions before his inevitable re-installation in power , with the goal of making him abandon the political demands that have motivated the popular mobilisations , such as the struggle for a Constitutional Assembly and for the punishment of those responsible for the coup .
Consequently , the National Front Against the Coup d'Etat only accepts the immediate , safe and unconditional reinstatement of President Zelaya to his post .
The Honduran working class , which since the beginning actively responded to the popular resistance , organised in the third week following the coup a unified mobilisation through its own methods of struggle : a general strike and the takeover of work centres , starting with a 48 - hour stoppage by the three central unions of the country -- the Unitary Confederation of Honduran Workers ( CUTH ) , General Workers Central ( CGT ) and Confederation of Honduran Workers ( CTH ) -- on July 23 - 24 , which was repeated again on July 30 - 31 .
In solidarity , friends from the popular organisations of El Salvador and Nicaragua [ blocked ] the entrance and exit of merchandise from Honduras .
Immediately the business associations of Honduras and Central America , who are in solidarity with the usurpers , screamed to the sky because that boycott implied losses of millions for their companies .
This means that the strike and the commercial boycott are effective weapons to wear out the economic base of the coup makers , more than formal declarations .
Because of all of this , the National Front Against the Coup d'Etat makes a call to working - class organisations of the wide to organise and carry out militant solidarity with the working class and the people of Honduras , carrying out boycott actions of all products that enter or come out of Honduran ports , with the goal of economically asphyxiating the dictatorship ; hold protests against the dictatorship in front of the US and Honduran embassies , organise political and cultural actions in solidarity with the struggle of the Honduran people , and carry out action that strengthen the struggle of the Honduran people and its working class to get us out of this oppressive regime and reach a new society .
ONLY WORLD WIDE UNITY OF THE WORKING CLASS WILL DEFEAT THE FASCIST EXPERIMENT IN HONDURAS !

Honduran workers fight for return of democracy
August 5 , 2009 -- Honduras 's three principal labour centrals , the Unitary Confederation of Honduran Workers ( CUTH ) , General Workers Central ( CGT ) and Confederation of Honduran Workers ( CTH ) have called for a national strike tomorrow , August 6 , 2009 .
Here is their statement :
The three workers Confederations of Honduras , CUTH , CGT and CTH address the critical political situation that prevails in our country as product of the coup d'état that threw out of the presidency Mr. Manuel Zelaya Rosales , legitimately elected by the Honduran people in free elections that took place in November 2005 .
This not a personal problem , it 's about the business sector and the vested interests who have generated a struggle between classes because of the social measures sponsored by the deposed government .
Facing this situation , our organizations condemn these facts and we do not recognize the so - called authorities of a dictatorial and de facto government .
We demand of all the governments of the world , the World Bank , the Interamerican Development Bank , the Central American Bank for Economic Integration and of USAID to withdraw all the official support and to freeze loans and projects to this coup government , imposed by the arms , which has created an atmosphere of repression and violence .
We make an exception with regard to that support which goes directly to the people and organisations .
We also demand of the OAS , the UN to maintain and strengthen the resolutions to repudiate this fascist government , product of the force of the arms , and to withdraw all support .
We ask that the government of the United States proceed in cancelling the bank accounts and visas to all those persons involved in the coup , to freeze planned support and to withdraw diplomatic representation , for as long as institutional order is not re-established with the return of Jose Manuel Zelaya to the presidency of the republic .
For all the above - mentioned , the CUTH , the CGT and the CTH call all their organisations to an open - ended national strike beginning on Thursday August 6 , 2009 , until the restitution of institutional order and the return of Jose Manuel Zelaya to the presidency of the republic .
Our organisations must remain on alert and support the patriotic march to the cities of San Pedro Sula and Tegucigalpa .
DEMANDS
1 . The reestablishment of the democratic institutional order
2 . The return of Mr. Jose Manuel Zelaya Rosales to the presidency of the Republic .
3 . The installation in Honduras of a Constituent National Assembly
4 . That the repression against the Honduran people be ended .

Global action day for Honduras on August 11 , 2009
By Henry Saragih , international coordinator of Via Campesina
To the sisters and brothers of all the regions of Via Campesina .
To the sisters and brothers of all social movements .
To all the people of the world .
Since the military coup -- after more than 38 days of untiring efforts by thousands of farmers , women , indigenous people , teachers , students , unionists , and ordinary citizens of the cities and the countryside to revert it and to recover democracy and dignity -- the repression by the coup participants has not notched the fighting spirit of the heroic Honduran people .
This struggle has now entered a crucial phase as the farmers ' movement and the National Front of Resistance Against the Coup d'Etat have summoned the social , union and democratic movements to a national march that begins on August 5 and will culminate on August 11 in Tegucigalpa and San Pedro Sula .
In support of this national march and our sister and brother farmers and all the Honduran people , Via Campesina calls you to participate in a " Global Day of Action for Honduras " , which will take place on August 11 , 2009 .
We seek to support strong solidarity efforts in carrying out political and cultural mobilisation , concrete actions and political pressure and lobbying , as well as any and all possible activities that help advance the Honduran popular resistance in defeating this military coup .
We ask you to inform us about your plans of action and work for the " Day of Global Action for Honduras " as soon as possible .
GLOBALISE THE HOPE !
GLOBALISE THE STRUGGLE !

Is the Roberts Court " Anti-Environment " ?
Recent articles in the National Law Journal , Daily Jorunal , and New York Times , highlight the Roberts Court 's record in environmental cases during the October 2008 term .
All three articles note that the side favored by environmentalist groups lost in all five environmental cases heard by the Supreme Court this past term .
This fact has also been the subject of discussion on the Environmental Law Profs e-mail listserv .
0 - 5 is certainly a poor record , but what does it mean ?
First , it 's important to put the five cases in context .
These are just five cases , and results from just a single term .
It 's also notable that only one of the five cases was decided 5 - 4 , and four of the five cases came from -- and reversed -- the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit .
This latter fact could just as easily suggest that the Ninth Circuit is environmentally extreme as that the Supreme Court is hostile to environmental protection or particularly " pro-business " in environmental cases .
The Roberts Court 's record in environmental cases is but one piece of the larger narrative that the Court has become significantly more conservative with the confirmations of Chief Justice Roberts and Justice Alito .
I 've addressed this claim at length before ( most recently here ) , so I wo n't dwell on it at length .
I will note , however , that there is no evidence -- not even from this term -- that Roberts and Alito have made the Court particularly more conservative or pro-business on environmental issues .
The NYT story quotes Temple law prof Amy Sinden saying that the cases this term " could all have come out very differently if we still had O'Connor on the court . "
This strikes me as absurd .
Only one of the five cases , Summer v. Earth Island Institute , was decided 5 - 4 .
While it is plausible to argue that Justice O'Connor might have voted in favor to confer standing on the environmentalist plaintiffs in this case , it 's hardly a sure thing .
She dissented in Lujan v. Defenders of Wildlife , but she joined the majority opinion in the earlier case of Lujan v. National Wildlife Federation and wrote a restrictive standing opinion in Allen v. Wright .
I also think that it 's highly unlikely that her vote would have differed from Justice Alito's in the remaining environmental cases -- and even then it might not have changed the outcome .
So what should we make of the Roberts Court 's record in environmental cases ?
This past spring I contributed a paper to the Santa Clara Law Review symposium on business and the Roberts Court focusing on environmental cases .
In this paper , which was published before the end of the October 2008 term , I noted that if one looks at all of the environmental cases decided by the Roberts Court thus far , there is no reason to conclude that the Court is particularly " pro-business " in these cases -- at least not yet .
My article stresses that this is a only a preliminary assessment , and that over time evidence in support of the " pro-business " or " anti-environment " charge may well emerge , but it has not yet .
If one wants to categorize the Roberts Court 's record on environmental cases thus far , it seems to me there is a stronger case that the Roberts Court 's environmental decisions are more " pro-government " than " pro-business . "
Since John Roberts became Chief Justice , the Court has decided 10 of its 18 environmental cases in a " pro-business " way .
At the same time , the federal government 's position has prevailed in 10 of the 15 cases in which it took a position , and government positions prevailed against private challenges in 11 of 16 cases .
Further , one of the government 's biggest losses was also the biggest business loss -- Massachusetts v. EPA - and that decision will also result in a substantial increase in government regulation .
Eighteen cases is still a very small sample .
But if we look at the substance of the individual cases , so as to provide a " qualitative " and not merely quantitative assessment , I think the case for calling the Court more " pro-government " than " pro-business " only becomes stronger .
most of the business wins maintained the status quo or affected a very small change in the law .
( This term 's Superfund decision on " arranger " liability is the notable exception . )
The same cannot be said for some of the environmentalist victories .
Massachusetts v. EPA is a more substantial environmental victory than the five environmental decisions combined were a loss for environmentalists .
One interesting fact is that the Roberts Court does appear to be more aggressive in accepting cert on environmental cases than one might expect , particularly given the smaller size of the docket .
As Georgetown 's Richard Lazarus has observed , the Court took several cases in which the Solicitor General 's office argued against it ( and , in some of those cases , the federal government had lost below ) .
This could be part of the larger move toward taking more business and regulatory cases generally , or something else .
I am not sure , but it will be worth watching to see if this trend continues .
A few more qualifications are in order .
First , labels like " anti-environment " or " pro-business " are overly simplistic descriptions and tell us little if anything about the legal merits of individual cases .
Even a " pro-environment " court may rule against the environmentalist position if their legal case is weak .
Second , given the small number of environmental cases heard by the Roberts Court , any assessment is preliminary and subject to revision as the Court hears and decides more cases .
If my assessment that the Court is more " pro-government " than " pro-business " in its environmental cases , than the change in Presidential administration should have an effect .
Specifically , if my analysis is correct , then we should see the Court begin to issue more " pro-environment " or " anti-business " decisions as the position of the various agencies and the Justice Department become less business friendly .
This is what I would predict based on what we 've seen thus far , but we 'll have to see .
Indeed , now that the Court has taken a potentially significant takings case for next term , and could well take another , I would be happy to see my hypothesis proven wrong , but I wo n't hold my breath .
A new strain of HIV has jumped from gorillas to humans .
So far , only one person , a 62 - year - old French woman from Cameroon , has been found to be infected with the virus , which closely resembles strains of simian immunodeficiency virus ( SIV ) recently discovered in western gorillas in the wild .
“ It would be surprising if there are n’t some more ” human cases , says David Robertson , a bioinformaticist at the University of Manchester , UK who analysed the virus ’s DNA along with colleagues in France .
“ We do n’t think this is a direct gorilla - to - human transmission . ”
Drug hope
Until 2004 , the infected woman lived in a suburb of Cameroon ’s capital city Yaoundé , where she did n’t come into contact with apes or eat their meat – SIV ’s primary route to humans .
This means that she probably acquired the infection from another human , likely through sexual contact .
The woman has n’t yet shown any sign of a compromised immune system – the hallmark of AIDS – but tests on laboratory - cultured human cells suggest that the virus can replicate in the same white blood cells as other strains of HIV .
However , the new virus should be susceptible to anti-retroviral drugs that slow the growth of other strains of HIV , Robertson says .
Advertisement
Based on its genetic sequence , the virus appears most closely related to a number of SIV strains collected recently in gorilla faecal samples from forests in Cameroon .
These viruses also resemble “ group O ” strains of HIV , which infect far fewer people than other strains of HIV , most of them in Cameroon .
Original source
The discovery of a gorilla virus in humans could suggest that some of these group O viruses came from gorillas , Robertson says , but it ’s also possible that the virus originated chimpanzees and was transmitted independently to gorillas and to humans .
“ Until we do more sampling we ’re also guessing a little bit , ” Robertson concedes .
Moreover , the virus ’s discovery adds to growing evidence that new HIV strains may regularly emerge from other primates , says Martine Peeters , a virologist at the University of Montpellier , who led the team that identified the first gorilla SIV strains .
“ It is just an additional demonstration that these viruses have jumped several times from apes to humans . ”
Virologists could be missing many of these transmissions because existing HIV tests are biased to identify already circulating strains of the virus .
“ We ’re very good at detecting HIV , so unless you do these other more in depth tests , you would n’t necessarily detect these very divergent viruses , ” Robertson says .

Ahmad Vahidi , nominated Thursday by President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad to serve as Iran ’s defense minister , is a suspected international terrorist sought by Interpol in connection with a deadly 1994 attack on a Jewish community center in Argentina .
Mr. Vahidi , a former commander of the elite unit of the Revolutionary Guard known as the Quds Force , was one of 15 men and three women named to Cabinet posts by Mr. Ahmadinejad as he begins his second term in office .
The choice is likely to further chill relations between Iran and the international community , especially Israel .
Interpol , the international police agency based in Lyon , France , placed Mr. Vahidi and four other Iranian officials on its most - wanted list in 2007 at the request of Argentine prosecutors , who say the men played a role in planning the July 1994 attack on the seven - story community center in Buenos Aires .
The bombing , which killed 85 people , is thought to have been carried out by members of Hezbollah , a Lebanese militia and political party with close links to Iran .
Kenneth Katzman , a senior analyst on Iraq and Iran at the Congressional Research Service , said that Mr. Vahidi is also suspected of having played a role in a 1996 attack on the U.S. Air Force barracks in Saudi Arabia known as Khobar Towers .
Mr. Vahidi is not the first prominent Iranian to be wanted in connection with terrorist attacks .
Presidential candidate Mohsen Rezai , a former revolutionary guard commander , was among the five Iranians identified by Interpol in 2007 , as was former President Hashemi Rafsanjani .
But Mr. Vahidi ’s ascension to the high - profile post of defense minister suggests that Mr. Ahmadinejad will continue his policy of defiance toward the West .
“ This sends a signal that the Iranians are unconcerned with anybody ’s sensibilities about the regime ’s prior record of terrorism , ” said Kenneth Piernick , a former chief of the FBI ’s Iran - Hezbollah unit .
“ His reputed intimate involvement in various acts of terrorism , particularly against Argentina and the United States , makes his selection especially flagrant .
This does not look like an unclenched fist . ”
Mehdi Khalaji , a senior fellow at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy , said , “ In general it does not seem Ahmadinejad ’s policy has been changed in terms of domestic and foreign policy .
These people involved in the Quds Force or people who come from the Revolutionary Guard , they have been in previous governments and this government as well . ”
Indeed , Mr. Vahidi served as deputy defense minister during Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s first term .
Mr. Khalaji did say , however , that the Interpol warrant would make it difficult for Mr. Vahidi to travel abroad .
While analysts pored over Thursday ’s Cabinet choices for clues to Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s intentions , Mr. Katzman of the CRS said it was the selection of Mr. Vahidi that stood out for him .
“ Vahidi was commander of the Quds Force during the late 1980s to early 1990s , and his choice certainly sends a very strong signal that Ahmadinejad plans to continue , and maybe even accelerate , Iran ’s material support for pro-Iranian parties and militias in the region , ” Mr. Katzman said .
Mr. Ahmadinejad ’s election has been protested by hundreds of thousands of Iranians , who poured into the streets after the state - run media and later Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said Mr. Ahmadinejad had won nearly two - thirds of the June 12 vote .
Protests against the government have continued throughout the summer , though many protest leaders and leading reformist politicians are now facing trial on charges of inciting a “ velvet revolution . ”
Meanwhile , many Iran analysts say , the Revolutionary Guard has effectively taken control of the country .
Mr. Ahmadinejad began installing former associates from the guard in Iran ’s civil service after he won his first election in 2005 .
The Quds Force , named for the Arab word for Jerusalem , helped facilitate attacks on U.S. and coalition forces in Iraq in recent years by aiding , equipping and funding the Shi’ite militias involved .
Interference from the Quds Force became so intense that the Bush administration in its final months in office designated the organization a foreign terrorist entity , a designation that President Obama has not lifted .
Malcolm Hoenlein , vice chairman of the Conference of Presidents of Major Jewish Organizations , said the elevation of Mr. Vahidi “ is reflective of the hard - line nature of the new Cabinet . ”
“ This should heighten concerns about Iran ’s pursuit of nuclear weapons .
There is still an outstanding warrant for those men , including Vahidi , who are responsible for the bloody and brutal attack on the Jewish community center and Israeli Embassy in Buenos Aires , ” he said .

The Hasidic community has been upset over bike lanes in their South Williamsburg for months , what with the immodest apparel of female bicyclists and the lanes taking up street space .
Previously , the Hasidim announced they would use private buses to intentionally block bike lanes ; now a reader tells us about her ride today :
Things have gotten pretty terrible in the saga of the Kent Ave .
bike lane , at least for me .
Today I had to ride between North Williamsburg and Fort Greene .
On my way there , an older Hasidic man stepped right off the empty sidewalk and into the bike lane right in front of me as I was riding by Shaffaer 's Landing .
He seriously tried to play a game of chicken with me and stepped in that lane when I was a good 10 yards back so I would have to swerve around him .
On my way back around 4 p.m. things got a bit worse .
As I was making a left from Wallabout onto Kent to go under the BQE ( not the best route , I know , but I wanted to get home quickly ) a bus drive by a Hasidic man ( no other people on it ) sped up to make the right onto Kent in front of me even though there was no room for him to make the turn .
I know this is hard to explain in an email , but he made it impossible for me to access the far right side of the street .
I had to turn in between two lanes of traffic .
There was no space for me to get over until I got closer to the light , which had by that time changed .
I tried to pull up into the gas station on that corner , but a huge truck with a crane started backing out .
I had to swerve back into traffic where I hit a huge crack and bit it .
My head almost got run over by a car .
Fortunately , I got away with a scraped knee and the creeps .
Of course , by the time I finally made it back to the start of the bike lane again on the other side of the BQE there was a guy driving his minivan down it ... IN REVERSE !
Can't wait to bring this up at the Community Board meeting .
It ’s finally here !!!!!
That ’s right the first NFL Training Camp begins this Friday with the Cleveland Browns .
Come on , admit it you know you ’re excited .
With that being said I think it ’s time to break down what teams have the best camps for fans , and I ’m not just talking about what takes place on the field .
The best camps for fans are the ones that are family friendly environments .
The fathers and older sons only care about the football , but what if you have a kid who ’s eight ?
What if you ’re already on a family vacation conveniently planned at the same time and place as your favorite teams ’ camp ?
In those cases you need something that ’s going to appeal to the whole family , or at least have attractions nearby for them .
So here ’s what I ’m going to do , I ’m ranking the Top 10 NFL Training Camps for Fans .
These are places that have a good mix of football , family fun and tradition .
I will of course give more weight to the football .
# 10 – Indianapolis Colts
First practices is scheduled for August 2nd @ Rose - Hulman Institute of Technology
The highlight of Colts training camp is n’t Peyton Manning , its Colts City .
Colts
City is an interactive area but not just for the kids !!!
It ’s for all ages !
Colts City includes all the typical inflatable toys like the Quarterback Throw , Football Bouncer and Mountain Slide .
They ’ve also got a rock climbing wall .
Most importantly they ’ve got the Colts cheerleaders and that ’s what the non-kids will be looking forward to .
# 9 – Dallas Cowboys
First practice is scheduled for July 29th at the Alamodome in San Antonio , Texas .
In my eyes there is n’t anything really special about the Cowboys training camp but it is “ America ’s Team ” so you know they have to do something special to get attention .
How do they do that ?
They have a special kickoff concert the night before the first practice .
On Tuesday , July 28th they ’ve got a concert by Intocable and the Randy Rogers Band .
Couple country bands that obviously only the Cowboys fans would care about .
But regardless its Jerry Jones and he ’s got to do something big .
In my opinion the two best things about Cowboys practice is that it ’s indoors ( perfect for summer weather in Texas ) and the Cowboys Cheerleaders !
Those girls alone would be enough to get me to show up .
# 8 – New York Jets
First practice is scheduled for Friday , July 31 @ SUNY Cortland .
The first thing that stands out about Jets training camp is the locations .
That ’s right locations .
They take the show on the road and practice at three different locations over the month .
The main location is SUNY Cortland located in Central NY but they also have a couple practices at their former home of Hofstra University , located in Long Island .
Starting in late August they move camp to their normal training facilities at Florham Park in New Jersey .
Another thing that stands out to me is the inclusion of sports talk radio to their practices .
Most teams let their local station broadcast from camp , but the Jets actually advertise this on their website that ESPN NY will be there on select dates .
And we all know how important sports talk radio is to the New York fan , so yea its something they should promote .
The Jets also have the usual things you ’ll see at most camps in the league , i.e. Blood Drive , Kids Zones , etc .
The Jets label their kid zone “ Generation Jets Fest ” which includes a theme park , rides for the kids , skill challenges and special autograph sections .
# 7 – Cleveland Browns
First practice is scheduled for July 24th at Berea , Ohio
The Browns practices are exactly what you would expect , loud and rowdy .
What do you expect from the Dawg Pound right ?
You ’ll get a lot of barking and yelling , with even more barking if there is a big hit or huge play .
The family friendly aspect comes in when you consider the teams annual Family Night and the local attractions .
Downtown Cleveland is only about 20 miles away where there is no shortage of things for the family to do .
# 6 – Kansas City Chiefs
First practice is scheduled for August 1st at the University of Wisconsin
Chiefs camp is one held a good ways from their home but still filled with plenty of its local fans .
It ’s the Midwest so you know those KC fans will travel and best part ?
You know they ’ll be bringing that damn good barbeque with them .
Unfortunately the Chiefs do n’t have daily activities for the kids thou , but they do have two days set aside August 5th and 12th where there will be kid fun zones set up , included discounted concessions .
August 1st is also a Punt , Pass , Kick competition .
The highlight of their camp like most others is Family Fun Night scheduled for August 8th , which is also the one day families will have to pay for entry .
# 5 – Minnesota Vikings
First practice is scheduled for July 31st at Minnesota State University
The Vikings really reach out to their fans during training camp .
After their first practice on July 31st they hold a team introduction event where the players and coaching staff , well introduce themselves and also toss autographed footballs to the crowd .
On August 7th the team holds a night practice that ’s followed by fireworks , always a huge draw .
Then just a few days later , August 12th they hold Fan Appreciation Day where the Vikings Cheerleaders roam the crowds giving out prizes .
Want even more ?
They have the Kids Zone open daily .
They also have a cheerleading clinic , the punt , pass , and kick competition AND three Gatorade Jr Training Camps .
That ’s a pretty stacked camp for the families there .
# 4 – Atlanta Falcons
First practice is scheduled for August 1st in Flowery Branch , GA
The Falcons have all your typical family friendly activities but there are two specific weekends that really impressed me and had them jump to near top of the list .
Youth Weekend – August 1st and 2nd – This event includes autograph sessions with the Falcons cheerleaders ( teenage boys are going to love that ) and opportunity to try on authentic equipment used by the Falcons players .
There are tons of giveaways to including autographed memorabilia and tickets to the home opener against the Miami Dolphins .
All - State All - Access Weekend – August 7th and 8th – On Saturday the 8th , the team hosts “ Rome the Dome ” at the Georgia Dome which features a mock game .
It ’s not much different then your usual family night scrimmage but nice that they bring it to the home of the Falcons .
What really got my attention is what happens on the Friday night before .
The Falcons take it old school and host a “ Friday Night Lights ” practice .
The most impressive part is they take it to a local high school ’s field , Brookwood in Seneca , GA .
Not many teams do that so that is pretty unique .
# 3 – Chicago Bears
First practice is scheduled for July 31st at Olivet Nazarene University
The Bears are at the top of this list because of the shear amount of activities and themes they have .
First , I ’ll say they ’ve got all the usual stuff , kid ’s zones , Gatorade Jr camps , kid autograph sessions and plenty of giveaways .
The impressive thing thou is they have theme days much like baseball teams have their themed nights .
These days included Comcast Hispanic Day , Run With Staley ( mascot ) , Safety Service Day ( with members of local fire , police , medical ) and a very very popular Armed Forces Day .
In addition they ’ve also got the Family Night at the practice facility and a Family Day at Soldier Field .
Did I mention they ’ve also got a beer garden !!!!
One of few teams that actually allow real beverages .
What makes it even more enjoyable for the fans is the team that hosts all of that is DA BEARS !
# 2 – Philadelphia Eagles
First practice is scheduled for July 27th at Lehigh University
What makes the Eagles camp one of the best for fans is well , the fans .
They ’ve got some of the rowdiest and most loyal fans in the league .
Starting July 27th the Phillies will almost be put on the backburner in the city because it ’s now Eagles time .
( Personally , I think that ’s obnoxious its jumps and they are the PHUCKING CHAMPS ! )
Many people save their family vacations for August .
They do n’t go to the shore , they go to the country to watch their Eagles .
All the parents and kids want to do is go up to Bethlehem and watch B - West make a great cut and be off to the races .
Watch # 5 throw the deep bomb to DeSean for six .
All while chanting E - A - G - L - E-S .
After all that is said and done they want to take their chance at getting that big autograph .
The Eagles autograph sessions after practice is one of the biggest highlights of camp for people .
Like I said it ’s a loyal fan base and they want to add that to their living room shrines .
One of the most popular events of the past , The Eagles Carnival and Auction will no longer be taking place .
After 14 years the organization thought it was best to retire it for something better , “ Eagles Flight Night ” .
The Eagles will head home to the Linc for a night practice on August 2nd .
Unfortunately it ’s a high priced event but their faithful will be there .
To start practice the team will hold player introductions like it was a regular season game , something that will be sure to fire the fans up .
During practice you can expect the hot Eagles cheerleaders and Swoop to be all over the stadium .
After its all said and done they ’ll be a fireworks show .
Most Eagles fans will be mad their camp is number one .
They want to be the best in everything .
But just like the Super Bowl they tend to fall just short .
( Sorry had to take one shot at ya guys ! )
# 1 – Green Bay Packers
First practice is scheduled for August 1st in Green Bay .
The Packers are here not just because of activities but because of tradition .
The Packers have long been known to have one of the best training camps and some fans leave with amazing stories to tell .
One tradition included kids giving their bikes to players who would then ride the bike to practice with the kid either on the handle bar or his back .
Another highlight of the Packers camp is its proximity to Lambeau field .
It ’s closeness to the field allow the fans to venture over to the venue and check out things like the Packers Hall of Fame or even take a tour of the stadium .
They ’ve also got the Tundra Tailgate Zone ( air conditioned ) and Curly Pub / Game Zone to stop and eat and drink , in between or after practices .
Another team allowing booze , I like it !
These are all things that make the Packers camp number one in my book .
They take all the typical kid friendly things you see at other camps and involve their team ’s rich history in to it .
For a team like the Packers that is big considering they have one of the most storied pasts in NFL history .
So there you go , those are the Top 10 NFL Training Camp Locations in my book .
Have you been to an NFL Camp and think they belong ?
Think one is ranked too high or too low ?

[ TYPES ] Constructive Law of Excluded Middle
Continuing the discussion of teaching constructive proofs by contradiction , we show how to program with the law of excluded middle .
We specifically avoid call / cc , which is overrated .
Proofs by contradiction are not exclusive to classical logic .
For example , weak reductio -- proving the negation of a proposition A by assuming A and exhibiting a contradiction -- is intuitionistically justified .
Constructively , to prove the negation of A one has to build a witness of the type A-> F where F is a distinguished type with no constructors .
Strong reductio -- proving
A by contradiction with the assumption of NOT A -- is equivalent to the implication NOT NOT A -> A , or (( A -> F ) ->F ) ->
A . This implication is equivalent to the law of excluded middle ( LEM ) ( which can be shown by negating the law of contradiction ) and is certainly not intuitionistically or constructively justified .
It might be surprising therefore that one can still write a non-divergent Haskell term whose type is isomorphic to forall a .
((a-> F ) - F ) -> a
To be precise , the type is forall a. ( forall m. Monad m => ( ( a -> m F ) -> m F ) ) -> a
We will argue how all this is n't quite the double - negation translation and how call / cc and the related Cont monad can be avoided .
In fact , call / cc is an overkill for the computational version of LEM .
But first , a few preliminaries .
> {-# LANGUAGE EmptyDataDecls , Rank2 Types #-} > module LEM where > import Control .
Monad .
Identity > > data F -- no constructors
We should justify that a function of the type forall m. Monad m => t1 -> m t2 is just as pure as the function t1 -> t2 . ( Meta - variable t denotes some type ) .
The key is the universal quantification over m.
Informally , a term of the type ( forall m. Monad m => m t ) cannot have any effect because types of that form can only be introduced by `return ' .
More precisely , forall m. Monad m => m t is isomorphic to t forall m. Monad m => t1 -> m t2 is isomorphic to t1 -> t2 , etc .
One direction of the isomorphism is easy to show , for example > purify :: ( forall m. Monad m => ( ( a -> m b ) -> m b ) ) -> ((a->b )->b ) > purify f = \k -> runIdentity ( f ( return . k ) )
To show the other direction , we traverse a term , inserting return before each constant or variable and replacing applications with flip bind , aka ( = << ) .
Thus , if a proof term for the proposition ( NOTNOT a ) is n't already in the form ( forall m. Monad m => ( ( a -> m F ) -> m F ) ) , we can always make it so .
As the second preliminary , we introduce a Sum type and make it an instance of Monad .
We could have used the built - in Either type ( however , its MonadError instance needs an Error constraint , which gets in the way ) .
> data
Sum a b = L a | R b > instance Monad ( Sum e ) where > return = R > R x >>= f = f x > L x >>= f = L x
We are now ready to demonstrate the proof term for the proposition ( NOT NOT a -> a ) . > h :: ( forall m. Monad m => ( ( a -> m F ) -> m F ) ) -> a > h g = case g ( \x -> L x ) of > R x -> error " Not reachable " > L x -> x
One may be concerned about the `error ' function ( which can be replaced by any divergent term , e.g. , undefined ) .
We can prove however that the case R x is never taken , and so no divergence actually occurs .
If the function g ever invokes its argument , an `exception ' ( the L alternative of Sum ) is raised , which propagates up .
The function g , whose type is polymorphic over m , has no way to intercept the exception .
Hence , the L case will be taken in the function h .
The R case can only be taken if g can return a value without invoking its argument .
That is not possible however since no value of the type F can be constructed .
We will demonstrate the strong reductio later ; for now we show a simple illustration .
First , we introduce > --
A proof term for a -> NOT NOT a > lift :: forall a m. Monad m => a -> (( a -> m F ) -> m F ) > lift x = \k -> k x
Then * LEM > h $ lift " forty - two " " forty - two "
In fact , we can show that h ( lift x ) evaluates to x for all x .
One may ask if our constructive strong reductio works only for atomic proposition or for all propositions .
If the proposition is an implication , one could try to be clever , defining > t3 k = k ( \ ( ) -> k return >> return ( ) )
Note the non -linear use of k .
The evaluation h t3 will bind k to ( \x -> L x ) and so the `exception ' L will `leak out ' of h .
Fortunately , this clever cheating does not work , again because of the polymorphism over m .
The inferred type of t3 is t3 :: ( Monad m ) => ( (( ) -> m ( ) ) -> m a ) -> m a and hence the application h t3 is ill - typed because ` Quantified type variable `m ' escapes ' .
The type system ensures that the result of h has a pure type ( or isomorphic to a pure type ) , and so does indeed denote a proposition .
We now show how to obtain a proof term that represents LEM directly .
We represent the disjunction in LEM in its elimination form ( that is , Church - encoded ) .
We show two versions , without or with currying : > lem :: ( forall m. Monad m => ( a -> m w , ( a -> m F ) -> m w ) ) -> w > lem sum = case neg ( \x -> L x ) of > R y -> y > L y -> case pos y of > R z -> z > L _ -> error " unreachable " > where ( pos , neg ) = sum > lem1 :: ( forall m. Monad m => ( a -> m w ) ) -> > ( forall m. Monad m => ( a -> m F ) -> m w ) -> w > lem1 pos neg = case neg ( \x -> L x ) of > R y -> y > L y -> runIdentity $ pos y
No matter what 'a ' is , we can always produce either it or its negation .
Here is a more interesting illustration : > ex_falso_quodlibet :: F -> a > ex_falso_quodlibet falsum = h ( \k -> return falsum ) > tlem = lem ( return , \k -> ex_falso_quodlibet =<< k 42 ) > -- 42 > tlem1 = lem1 return ( \k -> ex_falso_quodlibet =<< k 42 ) > -- 42
We have just proven the existence of 42 by contradiction , using strong reductio .
Our terms lem and lem1 are not in the image of the double - negation translation of ( A + NOT A ) .
Indeed , the double - negation translation of the latter is NOTNOT ( NOT A + NOT NOT A ) , which is ( ( Either ( a -> F , ( a-> F ) ->F ) ) ->F )->F
This is different from the type of our lem and lem1 .
Applying Glivenko theorem directly to ( A + NOT A ) gives NOT ( NOT a & NOTNOT a ) , or ( a-> F , ( a-> F ) ->F ) ->
F which is again different from the type of our lem and lem1 .
Furthermore , although our terms h and lem have `classical ' types , we remain within constructive logic .
The term h is total , but the function g may not necessarily be so .
We know that if g ever invokes its argument ( that is , it constructed an object of the type a ) , then ( h g ) does produce that object .
NOTNOT
A does imply A in this case .
The function g cannot return without invoking its argument .
But the function g may diverge before invoking its argument .
We have thus confirmed the old result that LEM is intuitionistically justified for decidable propositions .
We stress that we have never used the continuation monad .
Our monad Sum is much weaker : it does not permit one to restart an exception , let alone restart the exception multiple times .
It seems we can do a lot without call / cc .
This subject is elaborated in Limit - Computable Mathematics ( LCM ) .
According to the leaders of the Left 4 Dead 2 boycott — who recently enjoyed a trip to Valve — there 's more downloadable content already in the works for the original Left 4 Dead , stuff beyond the already announced " Crash Course " episode .

According to on and off Left 4 Dead fan Walking_Target , Valve is planning something for release for the original , but would n't specify exactly what that was .
It could be " a new Special Infected , a new Campaign or new Weapon ( s ) . "
Vague enough for you ?
" It 's definitely one of the three , perhaps more , " he writes , if that helps .

Walking_Target also indicates that Valve has plans to address some of the issues that plague the original , like stacking and camping in corners .
Should Valve find a way to introduce one or more of Left 4 Dead 2's Special Infected — all seemingly designed to break up tightly guarded groups — that would certainly introduce a new dynamic to the game .
With " Crash Course " planned for a September release and Left 4 Dead 2 for November , we'd be surprised if the developer can sneak in more content for the original this year , especially when factoring in Valve Time .
But they 've surprised us before ...

You think you 're All That , but you 're not !
I have long been interested in term rewriting systems , and one of my long - term goals is to implement the Knuth - Bendix completion algorithm , described by Knuth and Bendix in their famous paper " Word Problems in Universal Algebras " .
This paper grabbed my attention around 1988 ; I found it in an anthology edited by John Leech ( of Leech lattice fame ) that I was probably looking into because it also contained an enumeration by J.H. Conway of all knots with at most eleven crossings .
I found the Knuth - Bendix paper very hard to read , but the examples at the end were extremely compelling .
I still find the paper very hard to read , but fortunately better explanations are now available .
( For example , this one by A.J.J. Dick . )
One of the also - ran topics for Higher - Order Perl was a structured drawing system based on Wm Leler 's " Bertrand " term - rewriting system .
So I was delighted to discover that there was a new book out called Term Rewriting and All That .
The " ... and All That " suffix is a reference to the tongue - in - cheek classic of British history , 1066 and All That , and promised a casual , accessible , and possibly humorous treatment .
Unfortunately the promise was not kept .
The book is very good , but it is not casual or humorous .
Nor is it especially accessible .
It is a solid slab of term rewriting , one of those books that make me think " I would not want to drop it on my foot . "
That is not a bad thing ; the Barendregt book is superb , an enormous superb slab of lambda calculus that you would not want to drop on your foot .
But it is not titled " Lambda Calculus and All That " .
So why the title ?
I do n't know .
The authors are Germans , so perhaps they do n't understand the joke ?
[ Addendum :
There 's exactly one review of this book on Amazon , and it says the same thing I do .
It begins : " My main criticism of this book is its title . " ]

Oh bye gum !
Shane MacGowan FINALLY gets a full set of new teeth
He is infamous for his shabby looks and gummy smile .
But all that 's in the past now for Shane MacGowan .
The Pogues singer has been spotted in Malaga with a new set of gnashers .
Fairytale smile : Shane MacGowan has been in Malaga getting his teeth fixed MacGowan has reportedly spent the last month in Spain having extensive dental work to repair the acute damage to his mouth caused by decades of hard partying .
During one all - day drinking session in Limerick , Ireland , he fell over a wall , smashing his teeth on a pile of bricks .
Mind the gap : MacGowan in 1994
The 51 - year - old became renowned for his dishevelled appearance and his terrible teeth , which eventually became his trademark .
But it was n't popular with everyone .
One American record company airbrushed some teeth onto him on an album cover so as not to put off U.S. fans .
MacGowan had recently talked about getting his teeth fixed to stop his face ' falling apart ' .
We think the dentally - discerning Yanks would approve of his pegs now ...
Is There Anything Sarah Palin Can't Polarize ?
Greg Sargent rounds up some other Republicans who have been supporters of adding end - of - life counseling to Medicare .
He 's got Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski on the list , but should also add Richard Lugar , who co-sponsored the 2007 Medicare End - of - Life Care Planning Act .
That said , I 'm uncomfortable hunting down every Republican who ever supported sensible end - of - life counseling policies and demanding they denounce Sarah Palin .
This is one of those aspects of health - care policy that should not be a partisan football .
When Johnny Isakson offered his amendment in the Senate HELP Committee , it passed on an unanimous voice vote .
Not a single Democrat dissented .
It is testament to Palin 's talents as a polarizing force that she 's managed to make this issue controversial .
And I 'm sympathetic to Sargent 's argument that principled Republicans should denounce her demagoguery .
But it 'll be a real shame if a sensible policy encouraging end - of - life counseling becomes a casualty of Palin 's political style .
I fear it would be difficult for Isakson to argue today , as he did in April of 2008 , that " you ought to be required to execute a durable power of attorney when you become eligible [ for Medicare ] . "
But that was the right policy then then and it's the right policy now .
Encouraging individuals to set down their end - of - life treatment wishes when they 're of sound mind and body is not a liberal idea or a conservative idea .
It 's simply a responsible idea .
And that 's why responsible members of both parties have advocated it .

Where to Put 'em is the Fantasy Football Nerd 's look at the best and worst matchups for the week .
Decisions are based upon the FFN rankings and matchup analysis .
Given the known conditions , these matchups are the ones to watch and / or avoid .
Put 'em In The Game : Eli Manning
Plaxico who ?
Eli did n't need Plax last week against the Cowboys where he threw for 330 yards and 2 TD's .
This week he faces the Buccaneers who rank 27th against the pass and 31st in points allowed .
His FFN rank is # 7 among QB's and he should produce 240 - 260 yards and 2 TD 's against Tampa Bay .

Put 'em In The Game : Ben Roethlisberger
Aaron Rodgers could n't do it , but Big Ben should put up good numbers against the Bengals .
The Steelers have been known for their run game and defense .
Passing has not been their strength , but what a difference a year makes .
Pittsburgh is the 8th best passing team this year and rank near the end in rushing .
Look for Roethlisberger to find Hines Ward and Santonio Holmes and continue his aerial assault .

Put 'em In The Game : Matt Forte
Matt Forte has yet to find the endzone , but that should change this week .
Most experts believe he 'll post double digit points this week .
While his deviation is pretty high , his projections put him in at # 5 among RB's .
The Seahawks have a good defense this year , but they 're 26th against the run .
Frank
Gore went off against them last week and I 'm expecting Forte to go over the century mark as well .

Marion Barber has said that he 'll play , but his status is questionable .
If he can't go , Felix Jones becomes an even better option against Carolina who ranks 28th against the run .

Steve Smith ( the one from New York ) and Mario Manningham claim the # 10 and # 11 spots this week in the FFN WR Rankings .
Tampa Bay is 27th against the pass and 31st in points allowed .
You picked up these guys on the waiver wire so here 's your chance to use them .

Never before has Greg Jennings been held to 0 receptions until last week .
That should not happen against a St Louis defense that ranks 25th against the pass .

Philip Rivers is running wild and Vincent Jackson is hauling in the yards .
Jackson torched a strong Raven 's defense for 141 yards and a TD .
Miami ranks 23rd against the pass .

Put 'em In The Game : Dustin Keller
Mark Sanchez has looked brilliant in his first two outings and Dustin Keller has been an awesome target .
The normally stout Titans defense has dropped to 32nd against the pass .
FFN ranks him at # 11 among TE's this week and with good reason .
Expect somewhere around 7 points this week in non-ppr leagues .

Expect a healthy dose of the Chris Cooley show against the Lions .
In the first 2 games of the season , Detroit has allowed 3 TD's to tight ends .
Cooley has been the most consistent performer in the Washington offense so expect that to continue this week .

Put 'em In The Game : Neil Rackers
I normally do n't care to offer predictions on kickers because they can be inconsistent and low - scoring , but Neil Rackers is a good option this week against the Colts who have given up the 2nd most points to kickers through two games this season .
His # 2 FFN ranking has a lower standard deviation than most of the other kickers and I like that !

Put 'em On The Bench : Brett Favre
Favre did alright last week with 2 TD's , but his role has been defined more as an elder and clock manager .
Nobody will doubt his ability to hand off to AP , but it looks like the Favre from 2 retirements ago is long gone .
It 's time to retire him to your bench this week .

Put 'em On The Bench : Jay Cutler
I know I might catch some heat for putting Cutler on the bench after his performance last week , but he has n't inspired any confidence in me after the first 2 weeks .
He goes up against a Seattle defense that is 2nd against the pass but has n't really earned that spot because they 've played against the Rams and the 49ers .
I could be wrong here and Cutler could turn in a strong performance , but play a safer option if you have it .
Let 's see what Week 3 brings first .

Put 'em On The Bench : Thomas Jones
Sit Thomas Jones ?
Seriously ?
Yes .
As good as TJ is , he 's got a ridiculously difficult job this weekend .
His # 30 ranking among RB 's this week is due to the Titan 's 2nd best rush defense in the NFL .
The Titans allow an average of 49.5 yards on the ground and that just does n't add up to any significant points .

Cedric Benson was a monster last week against the Packers , but do n't expect that same Benson to show up this week .
The Steeler 's 9th ranked rush defense will have something to say about that .

Brandon Marshall was a stud last year , but the loss of Jay Cutler and his poor attitude has turned this fantasy play maker into a dud .
Nnamdi Asomugha will be all over him this weekend and Marshall is still sitting in the dog house .
Given his # 52 ranking this week , there are much better options out there .

There were some very high hopes for Bernard Berrian prior to the start of the season .
Unfortunately , Favre has n't been his old gun-slinging self and San Francisco ranks 4th in the league against points scored .

After a strong
Week 1 performance where he hauled in 4 receptions for 135 yards and a score , Patrick Crayton was held to just 1 reception for 4 yards last week .
Carolina is 3rd against the pass and Crayton is just too inconsistent .

Greg Olsen was supposed to be a major benefactor of the Jay Cutler acquisition , but it just has n't panned out .
Whether it's a lack of targets or his inability to hold onto the ball , Olsen has become one of the worst scoring TE 's in the league .
Put him on the bench until he proves himself .

When you have one of the worst NFL quarterbacks throwing to you , you know you 've got an uphill climb .
Denver was n't known for their defense last year , but believe it or not , they 're ranked # 10 against the pass in 2009 .
I hate to say it , but perhaps Miller should get used to the bench .

Governments are regaining control of the internet ( Image : Frederic J. Brown / AFP / Getty )
WHEN thousands of protestors took to the streets in Iran following this year ’s disputed presidential election , Twitter messages sent by activists let the world know about the brutal policing that followed .
A few months earlier , campaigners in Moldova used Facebook to organise protests against the country ’s communist government , and elsewhere too the internet is playing an increasing role in political dissent .
Now governments are trying to regain control .
By reinforcing their efforts to monitor activity online , they hope to deprive dissenters of information and the ability to communicate .

This diary offers a colloquially worded straightforward brief introduction to benefits , that I 've observed as an expatriate American living in the E.U. , which are typically received by Western European workers , even what would be considered in the US low paid unskilled service jobs .
It is the hope of this diary to promote a thoughtful discussion as to why working people in the US do n't receive these same type of benefits from the barebones American social system .
Concurrently it is the hope of this diary that people who have international experience living in countries that provide the type of social benefits described in this diary , would consent to extending themselves to comment .
Having said that we all recognize that everyone has the ability to comment , and everyone 's comments and questions are equally valued and welcome .
Why do workers across Western Europe receive 20 to 30 days paid vacation ?
We 've all heard the stories that American workers receive about half of the paid vacation as their European counterparts .
For me this however is n't an abstract idea , it 's a reality as an American expat that I see every single day .
Did you know that even American companies operating throughout Western Europe are required by law to provide 20 days paid vacation to all employees .
How is it that these American companies can do this in Western Europe and show a profit , but if they do it in the States they will become insolvent .
The short answer can be described in one word - which is sophistry .
The U.S. government , of course , guarantees precisely zero days of paid vacation for those employed in the private sector .
For those Americans not working for government agencies , then , the amount of time off they get is a matter of negotiation with their employer and , usually , the number of years at a given firm .
As a result , " Americans work two weeks longer than the work - till - you - drop Japanese , and two months longer than the Germans , who sometimes receive up to 15 weeks paid vacation each year , according to the Hay Group , a human resource consulting firm . " Indeed , " The U.S. is second from the bottom with 10 days , tied with both Canada and Japan .
Only Mexico , with a piddly six days , offers employees less vacation time . "

Statutory minimum annual paid vacation days by country : Austria - 25 paid vacation days
Belgium - 20 paid vacation days
Denmark - 25 paid vacation days
Finland - 20 paid vacation days
France - 25 paid vacation days
Germany - 20 paid vacation days
Greece - 20 paid vacation days

Portugal - 22 paid vacation days
Spain - 22 paid vacation days
Sweden - 25 paid vacation days
United Kingdom - 20 paid vacation days
United States - Zero paid vacation days
http://www.acus.org/...
Nearly one - fourth of American workers have no paid vacation or holidays , according to a recent study from the Washington , D.C. - based Center for Economic and Policy Research , and nearly half of all private - sector workers have no paid sick days .
http://www.illinoistimes.com/...
Not all but many countries in Western Europe offer up to a year 's paid sick leave or more if you have a physician 's certificate of medical disability .
For most Americans living in the US this would be actually impossible to imagine .
There are systems in place to prevent abuse of paid sick leave and while the paid sick leave benefit system will vary from one country to the next within the European Union .
The amazing thing is there is no job protected paid sick leave system required by law in the USA in accordance with any national uniform standard for all employees , unlike in EU countries .

Parent 's Maternity Leave :
Did you know that the US virtually speaking is the only industrialized nation in the world that does n't have job protected paid maternity leave by right of law ?
[ Please note the Family and Medical Leave Act in the US only provides for unpaid leave ] .
By contrast virtually all countries in Western Europe have some type of mandatory job protected paid maternity leave by right of law available to working parents .
These systems can vary from about 5 months to up to 2 years paid maternity leave depending on the country within the European Union .
Again American companies operating in Europe are required by law in the European Union unlike in the US , to provide paid maternity benefits to all working parents irrespective of the type of job or position they hold .

In Norway we have a choice between 46 weeks ( with 100 % pay ) or 56 weeks ( with 80 % pay ) parental leave .
Six weeks are reserved for the mother , 10 weeks reserved for the father ( plus the 2 weeks off they get at the time of the birth ) , and the rest can be shared .
Next year , the fathers 10 weeks will be increased to 12 weeks .

Medical benefits are provided to all persons in the European Union irrespective of employment status .
As an American expat in Europe I have seen that all persons who are residents in the European Union , irrespective of the type of job they hold
or the length of their employment , receive complete medical benefits for themselves and their families .
Excluding people for medical coverage for pre-existing conditions is virtually unheard of in the EU .
Unemployment compensation :
Most Western European countries have unemployment compensation systems , wherein when your regular unemployment insurance runs out you receive some type of unemployment insurance assistance social benefit payments , which never run out in most Western European countries .
As such this also provides for medical care for the unemployed worker and their families .
When I first found out about this I was truly shocked , and my friends and family back in the States actually refused to believe it when I explained it to them .
Maybe that 's because the corporate owned mainstream media is n't interested in explaining these benefits to us on the 6 o'clock news Stateside .
I wonder why that is ?

European benefits also tend to last longer .
In Belgium , jobless benefits have no time limit at all .
In Denmark , the state replaces up to 90 % of lost wages and invests over 4 % of gross domestic product every year in supporting and retraining the jobless .
Jobless benefits vary around Europe , just as they can vary state - by - state in the U.S.
But in most Western European countries , the state replaces 60 % to 80 % of the average worker 's lost salary , compared with just over half on average in the U.S. , according to the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development .

A 2008 study by the CESifo Group , a European research group , shows that many public universities in Europe do not charge their students any tuition fees at all .
This is , for instance , the case in France , Ireland , Poland , the Czech Republic , Slovakia , Malta and all of the Scandinavian countries , according to the CESifo study .
http://media.www.theeagleonline.com/...
University tuition in the EU compared to the US is very progressive .
Most countries in continental Europe have no tuition except for modest registration fees , when compared to the US tuition system , which forces students from working families to take on large student loans , therein creating a new class of indentured servants .
A de facto form of economic slavery if you will , wherein student loan monthly repayments are on their way to becoming as much as most people 's modest mortgage payments .
Let 's add to that the fact that graduate students , as graduate students are not eligible for Pell grants , are now actually running over the Stafford student lifetime loan limit of $ 135,000 which has not been increased since 1992 for a period of some 17 years , because the GOP has no interest in seeing American students from working class families enter the ranks of leadership in govt or industry .
By contrast in the EU modest registration fees can vary from country to country .
In Germany for example registration fees are around 500 Euros per semester , plus you have to buy your own books in the EU .
In England they do have tuition but unless you make over a threshold amount you do n't have to repay your student loans .
In France for example there is no tuition as such whatsoever .
It just does n't exist .
Therefore people from working families can go to college or university and rise to management and leadership level in govt and industry much more easily .
Is n't that one more reason why France is more socially progressive than the US ?
Yet another civilized fact of life in the European Union countries is the fact that people who are on long term sick leave while on sick leave according to the European Union high court must be given the right to accumulate paid vacation days while on mandatory sick leave , as a human rights imperative and issue in equity .
To that end I offer the quote below :
Employees on long - term sick leave are still entitled to paid holiday , EU judges have said .
It means that staff can take their annual leave built up while at home as soon as they return to work .
In addition , any worker who is sacked or who leaves a firm while off ill must be financially compensated for the holidays not taken .
The European Court of Justice verdict takes effect immediately and cannot be appealed against .

In conclusion can we ask ourselves why does n't the corporate owned media inform the American people of the social safety net available in the European Union , Canada , Australia , Japan , New Zealand to name but a few .
I think the answer is obvious do n't you , when we consider who owns the commercial corporate mainstream American media .
Therefore it 's up to us that is to say political progressives to get the word out , to therefore invite all readers to comment on this diary .
I 'd also like to issue a special appeal to the Kossacks who have international experience living under the type of social safety net described in this diary to please consider extending yourselves to offer firsthand account that reflects your own empirical experiences attendant upon this subject matter .
As the Republicans have wrecked the American economy with their unregulated , vulgar robber baron Wall St capitalism , can we agree that after Wall Street has been bailed out it is now time for Main Street to be bailed out by a strengthened American social safety net , wherein not everything has to be ran for - profit .
As our politicians and journalists can no longer be relied upon to tell us the truth , in the ancient tradition only the court jester could be relied upon through satire to tell the truth .
It is in that vein that this diary offers a link to a modern day progressive court jester Bill Maher who in this video which ends this diary on a humorous note , reminds us there was a time in America when certain things were n't ran for profit , such as the health care system and the American prison system , both of which due to the profit motive have become infinitely worse .
Is n't it the truth that it 's a lot cheaper to pay for a strong American social safety net than it is to pay for an American prison system on steroids !
Also please note that the top five cities in the world to live in , none of them are in the United States .
Three of them are in Europe .

Archbishop Denis Hart .
Credit : Joe Armao Court documents confirm the archbishop 's outburst after he was granted an intervention order against the woman , who had pursued him over her abuse by priest Barry Whelan in 2001 .
The magistrate said that a ' 'very , very angry ' ' Archbishop
Hart had told the woman to '' go to hell bitch ' ' after she knocked on his door at 1.20 am in March , 2004 .
The woman was the subject of an earlier intervention order after she had thrown stones through a window of the archbishop 's house and hassled him and his staff .
Delivering her findings in June 2004 , Magistrate Goldsborough said : " Archbishop Hart has apologised for this appalling and ungracious act directly from the witness box in my presence . "
The magistrate said she " did not consider he [ Archbishop Hart ] was fearful or had any apprehension for himself or others " when he found the woman on his doorstep - but also described her conduct as unacceptable .
The magistrate found that the archbishop was angry that his privacy had been significantly breached as a result of the early morning visit .
But Ms Goldsborough rejected the archbishop 's lawyer 's claim that the victim 's abuse was not a relevant factor in the intervention order court case .
'' I am assured … by the archbishop himself that [ he ] … has a good understanding of the complex set of circumstances in which [ the victim ] finds herself at least in part caused by her … abuse by former father Barry Whelan . ''
In her findings , the magistrate also said that after attending the archbishop 's house , the woman had later asked for an apology from the archbishop over his comments and told his staff over the phone that she wanted to kill him .
Ms Goldsborough found that the woman '' had no intention to carry out this threat ' ' , but said it was '' threatening and alarming ' ' . '' [ The victim ] says all of the behaviour illustrated in her phone conversations is borne out of her hurt and frustration , '' Ms Goldsborough found .
'' While that may be entirely understandable in one sense it is absolutely unacceptable behaviour in all other senses . ''
Whelan abused the woman in 2001 after his suspension as a priest in the 1990s for abusing another woman had been overturned .
Over several decades , five women have accused Whelan of sexually abusing them , including a woman who was 13 at the time of the alleged abuse and a woman who claims to have had Whelan 's son .
The church reached a confidential settlement in 2006 with the woman involved in the 2004 court case .
While being unable to recall his comments to the woman and his dressing down by the magistrate , Archbishop Hart yesterday detailed some of the events that led to the court case .
'' I put my cassock on , I went down to the door and I was very annoyed … [ she was ] ringing and ringing and ringing , I had just got to sleep , I was very tired , I was about to go off to Rome and I went down and I am sure I would have spoken strongly , but what I said I do n't recall . ''
The Age reported yesterday that a St Patrick 's Cathedral newsletter last month named Barry Whelan as a ' ' living treasure ' ' , despite the church 's own investigator finding that he had abused several woman .
The archdiocese has said this was a mistake and has apologised .
The Age investigation into the Melbourne Catholic Church 's handling of sexual abuse claims has also reported :
?
That a priest accused of abusing a minor was told by a church investigator that he was the subject of a covert police probe .
Archbishop
Hart said yesterday he had accepted Peter O'Callaghan 's denial that he was told not to tell the priest about the police inquiry .
Loading ?
Comments from Melbourne Vicar General Les Tomlinson that there is a church sex abuse '' victims ' industry '' that seeks to exploit victims to make money - which the Archbishop yesterday said '' were n't helpful ' ' . ?
Calls from a victims collective , who are backed by two interstate bishops , to review the Melbourne archdiocese 's handling of complaints .
Archbishop
Hart said there was no need to review the system .
'' I would much rather concentrate on the compassion that we need to show to victims …
They are people who should have expected more from priests and it is a tremendous suffering to be let down by people they trusted . ''

IT IS the ultimate cosmic villain : space and time come to an abrupt end in its presence and the laws of physics break down .
Now it seems a “ naked ” black hole may yet emerge in our universe , after spinning away its event horizon .
In 1969 , physicist Roger Penrose postulated that every singularity , or black hole , must be shrouded by an event horizon from which nothing , including light , can escape .
His Cosmic Censorship Conjecture has it that singularities are always hidden .

SAN DIEGO ( Reuters ) - Sci -fi film “ District 9 ” is expected to lure huge crowds to U.S. theaters when it debuts on Friday after drawing throngs of fanboys to previews at last month ’s Comic - Con pop culture convention in San Diego .
Director Peter Jackson arrives at the 63rd Annual Golden Globe Awards in Beverly Hills , California January 16 , 2006 .
REUTERS / Lucy Nicholson
The movie , about aliens on Earth who possess powerful weapons that humans want to control , was co-written and directed by Neill Blomkamp and produced by Oscar - winning “ Lord of the Rings ” director Peter Jackson .
Jackson spoke to Reuters about making movies and adapting books like J.R.R. Tolkien ’s “ The Lord of the Rings ” trilogy and the upcoming “ The Lovely Bones ” and “ The Hobbit ” for film :
Q : Tell us about your creative process for making movies .
A : “ It starts and finishes with the screenplay because I just believe totally in the script and the need for the script to be solid and secure and to be structured and to be the blueprint that you build the whole film around .
Once the script ’s written , the going out and shooting the movie becomes a process of interpreting the script and working with terrific actors to make it come to life .
“ The script is the time I have the most creative freedom .
You do n’t have to worry about the budget , not initially .
You do n’t have to worry about the weather , you do n’t have to worry if you ’ve got your shot schedule that day .
You can write , and take as long as you need .
It has less pressure and it has the most creativity .
It ’s a fun part of the process . ”
Q : How was your process with “ District 9 ” different from what you were used to ?
A : “ ” District 9 ” was the first time I had ever worked with a degree of improvisation .
Normally , we write the dialogue and the actors say the dialogue .
And we very carefully fine - tune it .
But because Neill wanted “ District 9 ” to have a degree of reality , he wanted it to be almost like a spontaneous , unrehearsed feel .
We decided that we were going to have to use actors that improvise a little of the dialogue . ”
Q : How did this impact casting ?
A : “ We cast Sharlto Copley , an old school friend of Neill’s .
Neill thought that Sharlto would do a fantastic job in the film , which he ultimately was actually right .
What we did with “ District 9 ” was structured the screenplay and got the storyline right .
Every scene was written in terms of what the scene had to achieve and what had to happen , but we never wrote the actual dialogue . ”
Q : How creative can you be when adapting a film based on a literary product ?
A : “ It ’s a slightly different vibe .
There ’s a difference between an original screenplay and an adapted screenplay .
They both have to be structured in a very formal way .
But once you have a structure in place , an original screenplay is fun because you ’re able to ... create a world in your mind .
You have to create the rules of that world , the characters that are inhabited it , the time , the events ...
Whereas , with an adaptation , you ’re basing it more on your personal experience of reading that book . ”
Q : You had huge success with the “ Rings ” movies and you have two more adaptations with “ The Lovely Bones ” and “ The Hobbit . ”
How do you decide what to bring to the big screen ?
A : “ Often when I read books , I ’m imagining a movie .
It ’s just the way my brain works .
So I imagine camera angles and my brain is sort of assembling the film as I read the book .
Sometimes I read a book and I get very excited and I think , “ Wow , this would make a terrific film . ” ”
Q : What role does technology play in your creativity ?
A : “ Technology is interesting because it advances with time .
What is happening with technology at the moment is everything is getting cheaper and the quality is improving .
And I think that ’s really terrific from the point of view of filmmaking becoming less elitist .
“ You know , in the old days it was very difficult to make movies ‘ cause you had to have 35 millimeter cameras , which were phenomenally expensive .
Or you had to have rich parents that could send you to film school .
Nowadays , anybody , any kid or young person with a desire to make films ... ( has ) access to this equipment .
You have great video cameras and the quality ’s fantastic .
You can make soundtracks and do visual effects .
You can do very competent computer effects quite easily . ”
Q : What impact do you see this having on Hollywood ?
A : “ There are no excuses anymore .
If people really want to make movies , they can go out and do it .
And I think we ’re going see in the next 20 or 30 years a real influx of creativity to the world of entertainment because I believe a lot in the young generation coming along ... the pop culture generation who now can grab these cameras and go make films with them . ”

Free will is a necessary delusion .
The big bang happened , and then we do things .
If true randomness does exist it might rule out absolute determinism , but it still would n’t give us any more control over our decisions than if true determinism did exist .
Nature + nurture + stimuli = outcome .
However , this view , while true , cannot form the basis of a society .
The punishment of criminals and adoration of heroes requires the concept of personal responsibly .
Therefore , we must conduct ourselves , and society , as if free will does exist–even though we know it does n’t .
The way our true knowledge of free will comes into play is in our social policies , i.e. since we know that nature + nurture + stimuli results in an outcome , then we need to create social policy that prevents this combination from resulting in humans suffering , and effect change that modifies these variables to bring about happiness instead .
As such , a secular humanist worldview is , in my opinion , best suited for this approach .
On a side note , here ’s an interesting question to ask yourself about free will ( if you believe in it ) :
At what point does physics stop and free will start ?
If the answer is nowhere , then the conclusion is that despite what perception we have , all outcomes came from physical inputs .
The fact that we are one of those inputs does n’t mean we have any control over them .
The act of “ making a decision ” does not inject anything into the system other than another physical variable , which could only have come with the proper pre-existing , physical conditions .
In other words , outcomes move through us , and we participate by foolishly thinking we made something called a “ decision ” at some point or another in the process .
But in reality , every single input that resulted in our current state , came from a point outside of us , and the decision process now appears to be little more than a pre-action glimpse of what was going to happen anyway .
1
There is only one escape from this deterministic model , and that is if our decision process injects a variable from outside of physics , i.e. if free will comes from the supernatural .
Barring that , we have no true free will .
But let ’s keep pretending , because we go on if we did n’t . ::

( CNN ) --
A ransom has been demanded for a missing Russian cargo ship which vanished two weeks ago after being involved in a suspected hijacking off the coast of Sweden last month , Finnish police told CNN Saturday .
The last known contact with the Arctic Sea was July 31 .
Mystery surrounds its movements and the fate of its crew .
Authorities said the ransom demand might be from a second group of hijackers who targeted the ship after it was first allegedly hijacked for 12 hours off the coast of Sweden .
" There has been a demand for ransom and the subject is the shipping company , Solchart Management , " Jan Olof Nyholm with the Finnish police told CNN .
An international criminal investigation is under way into the alleged hijacking of the vessel , the Arctic Sea .
The last known communication with the vessel was July 31 .
The probe , involving Interpol , is being handled by Swedish , Maltese and Finnish authorities in cooperation with authorities from another 20 countries , the Malta Maritime Authority said in a statement Saturday .
Finnish police would not say how much ransom had been demanded , or what else they know about the vessel .
" At this point I can't comment on whether we know the whereabouts of the ship .
Our top priority is the threat to life and health , so I can't release any more details , " Nyholm said .
" The investigation has more details , but I can't say any more . "
The Arctic Sea , which sails under a Maltese flag , was carrying a 6,500 - ton cargo of timber from Finland to Algeria when it reported trouble on July 24 .
Its 15 - member crew told authorities that eight to 12 people armed with guns and pistols boarded the vessel about 3 a.m. that day , masked and wearing uniforms with the word " police " written on them , the Malta Maritime Authority said .
" During ( the attackers ' ) stay onboard , the members of the crew were allegedly assaulted , tied , gagged , and blindfolded and some of them were seriously injured , " the maritime authority said in a written statement .
" All crew members were ' hard ' questioned for a considerable amount of time .
The questioning was related to drug trafficking .
Later all crew members were released from their bindings but were locked within cabins until the alleged police rummaged the vessel thoroughly . "
The attackers left after 12 hours on the same black rubber boat on which they had arrived , which bore the word " police , " the maritime authority said .
The vessel 's radar and satellite systems were off - line for two hours during the reported hijacking , during which it was witnessed performing " extreme maneuvers , " said Maria Lonegard , a spokeswoman for the Swedish police .
The Finnish shipping company in charge of the ship reported the case to the Finnish police , who referred it to the Swedish police , the Maltese Maritime Authority said .
In the meantime , the ship sailed through the English Channel .
Three days later , on July 31 , Swedish police reached the ship by phone and spoke with someone they believed to be the captain , Lonegard said .
The crew provided photos of their injuries and written statements about the alleged hijacking , Swedish police said .
Despite that evidence , however , authorities have been unable to confirm the alleged hijacking .
Swedish police say they have spoken to a number of witnesses who saw the ship making strange movements , but no one saw the black rubber boat approaching or leaving the Arctic Sea .
The ship has not been heard from since July 31 .
It did not arrive in North Africa as scheduled August 4 .
Authorities have had no explanation for the ship 's disappearance until Saturday , when Swedish police said they believe the Arctic Sea has been hijacked a second time .
Track reports of the ship 's journey »
" It appears that we are now dealing with two separate incidents -- the alleged hijacking off the Swedish coast and now the alleged hijacking with a demand for ransom , " Lonegard told CNN on Saturday .
" The incident in the Swedish waters appeared over when we spoke to the crew and shipping company on the 31st of July .
So it appears the ship has been hijacked twice . "
Police do n't know the location of those demanding the ransom , she said .
An international criminal investigation is under way into the alleged hijacking , led by the Swedish , Maltese and Finnish authorities in cooperation with authorities from another 20 countries , the Malta Maritime Authority said in a statement Saturday .
Interpol and Europol are also involved .
The ship was reported Friday to be in international waters north of Cape Verde , an island nation a few hundred miles from the coast of western Africa .
The news came from Portugal 's state news agency , which quoted Cape Verde 's defense director , Pedro Reis .
The U.S. military also had a report this week that the ship was seen a few hundred miles from Cape Verde , two military sources told CNN , but the United States had no independent verification of those reports .
The U.S. military is not involved in the search .
Russia 's ambassador to Cape Verde , however , denied that the Arctic Sea had been spotted near the island .
The Russian military has been searching for days for the Arctic Sea , with naval vessels authorized to use force , Russia said this week .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev instructed Defense Minister Anatoly Serdyukov to " take all necessary measures to locate , monitor and , if necessary , to free the missing vessel , " a statement issued by the president 's office said .
Experts say maritime crime is rare in heavily policed European waters and more common around areas , such as Somalia , where governments have little or no control over their ports .
" Attacks on ships are extremely rare ; basically they do n't happen , " said Jeremy Harrison of the British Chamber of Shipping .
A spokesman for the Swedish Coast Guard said the last known hijacking of a vessel in Swedish waters occurred in the 16th century .
" The only way a ship can disappear is if someone has actually turned off the ship 's beacon , " said Natasha Brown with the United Nations ' International Maritime Organization .
" But if this is done , you could only find the ship if you actively searched for it with a plane or helicopter . "
CNN 's Per Nyberg in London , England , contributed to this report .

ROTTERDAM , the Netherlands 
When two inspectors swung open the doors of a battered red shipping container here , they confronted a graveyard of Europe ’s electronic waste  old wires , electricity meters , circuit boards  mixed with remnants of cardboard and plastic .
“ This is supposed to be going to China , but it is n’t going anywhere , ” said Arno Vink , an inspector from the Dutch environment ministry who impounded the container because of Europe ’s strict new laws that place restrictions on all types of waste exports , from dirty pipes to broken computers to household trash .
Exporting waste illegally to poor countries has become a vast and growing international business , as companies try to minimize the costs of new environmental laws , like those here , that tax waste or require that it be recycled or otherwise disposed of in an environmentally responsible way .
Rotterdam , the busiest port in Europe , has unwittingly become Europe ’s main external garbage chute , a gateway for trash bound for places like China , Indonesia , India and Africa .
There , electronic waste and construction debris containing toxic chemicals are often dismantled by children at great cost to their health .
Other garbage that is supposed to be recycled according to European law may be simply burned or left to rot , polluting air and water and releasing the heat - trapping gases linked to global warming .

" Did you make disease , and the diamond blue ?
Did you make mankind , after we made you ?
and the Devil too ? "
- Dear God , XTC
I just finished reading god is not Great by Christopher Hitchens .
He 's given us another powerful work in the vein of Sam Harris ( The End of Faith ) , Richard Dawkins ( The God Delusion ) , and Bill Maher ( Religulous ) .
Team Rationality is ushering in a long - overdue examination of religion in the modern world .
They make a strong case that religion is sick and dehumanizing .
I would say more specifically , sick religion is dehumanizing .
And we do have a global pandemic of sick religion : billions of believers stuck in low levels of consciousness , riddled with pathologies .
'S called Samsara where I 'm from .
However , reading these best - sellers has inspired me to make a wish - list .
Here are five things rational religion - haters should know :
1 , There are levels of religion .
I keep noticing that what many rational types detest is not religion per se , but its least - evolved expressions .
Over and over I hear atheists say " religion " when they are actually describing low levels of religion .
That confusion is not helping .
Eliminating religion will not eliminate low levels of development .
And that 's the real threat to humanity : Low levels of development in high positions of power .
Saying " Religion " is the problem does n't mean anything .
What level of Religion is being referred to ?
For example , here are five distinct levels of religious expression , from lowest to highest :
Magical - Animistic : Recently in Tanzania , religious figures have murdered over fifty innocent human beings because they happened to be albino .
The victims are killed so that their organs can be used in religious rituals that are supposed to create wealth .
That 's one of the things we get from a Magical mode of religion .
Blood sacrifice .
Mythic :
After the massacre of 3,000 Americans on 9/11 , Pat Robertson and Jerry Falwell claimed it was god taking revenge on our society for homosexuality and abortion .
Mythic religion is that old - school religion of supra-natural allegory .
Virgin births , raising the dead , walking on water , and the rapture .
Except mythic believers do n't consider their stories to be metaphoric symbols , they regard them as literal & real .
Mythic religion guided George Bush through eight years as President of the United States , and coincidentally also guided the terrorists to commit mass murder .
Rational : Francis Collins , one of the World 's most accomplished Scientists , calls his faith BioLogos , or theistic evolution .
He sees Science , and the empirical method , as a form of worship .
He rejects intelligent design .
Believe it or not , there are plenty of rational people who have believe in a Divinity of some kind .
Pluralistic :
For a taste of pluralistic Christianity , check out The Christian Pluralist by William C. Buffie , M.D. John R. Charles .
They even incorporate psychology in their faith , exploring shadow / projection in the realm of religion .
They embrace the Bible " as a story , not a weapon . "
Jimmy Carter has also demonstrated a strong pluralistic Christianity .
He even taught Sunday School in a Southern Baptist church while President .
Integrative :
In my opinion one of the most spiritually evolved Christians on the planet , Father Thomas Keating teaches a form of contemplative practice called Centering Prayer , which he describes as
" . . . a journey into the unknown .
It is a call to follow Jesus out of all the structures , security blankets , and even spiritual practices that serve as props .
They are all left behind insofar as they are part of the false self system . . .
The false self is an illusion .
Humility is the forgetfulness of self . "
These are five very distinct levels of the same religion , in this case Christianity , but it applies to any religion .
( I forgot to list the highest level of Christianity , which is Buddhism .
Kidding ! ) .
The point is , religion should not be regarded as horizontal & homogenous .
All belief systems include a vertical chain of development .
The ' answer ' to fundamentalism is not to get rid of Religion , but to get religion to evolve .
How can we help Pat Robertson discover his hidden Father Thomas Keating ?
Will Francis Collins agree to mentor Sarah Palin ?
I 'm kidding .
But I 'm not .
The answer to low levels of religion is higher levels of religion .
The real work ahead of us is religious development , not just embarrassing people into forfeiting their belief system ( they will just trade it for an equivalent one anyway ) .
If tomorrow , all the religions in the World magically vanished , we 'd face the same dangers of low levels of consciousness in high positions of power .
2 , There are healthy & pathological versions of every level .
A religious person can be healthy or sick at any stage of development .
The answer to sick religion is healthy religion .
While Pat Robertson told us 9/11 was God 's revenge for homosexuality , millions of other Christians - at the same mythic developmental level - were organizing their communities to offer help and healing .
Because that is what healthy mythic Christians do ( and they do it better than just about anybody ) .
For every sick fundamentalist there are many healthy believers contributing to society in a positive way .
3 , The more people evolve , the less religious ( fundamentalist ) they are .
One definition of ' religion ' is a partition between the saved and the damned , a boundary that separates ' us ' and ' them ' .
When people grow , they include more and exclude less .
As we live into higher development levels , our circle gets bigger .
Evolving means a bigger experience of ' We ' .
Also known as Love ;-)
As the self evolves , it recognizes more people ( and plants , and animals , and things ) as part of its own identity .
That 's why development creates security for everyone , it transforms ' them ' into 'us ' .
4 , At its higher levels , Religion resonates with science and rationality .
That 's because at its higher levels , religion becomes spiritual .
I define religion as a belief system used to interpret Reality .
I define spirituality as the direct experience of Reality .
No beliefs are required for spiritual practice .
( In Zen there is a saying : All beliefs are false . )
Spiritual experience can often undo religious belief .
Religion provides filters , and depends upon intermediaries and externally located salvation .
Spirituality removes ( or improves ) filters through direct access to our intrinsic nature .
Spiritual practices are empirical in this sense :
You want to know something ( like , what is Reality ) so you conduct an experiment .
For instance , you may spend a few decades making your Subject an Object of awareness .
You share your data ( gathered through direct experience ) to a group of qualified peers who have repeated that same experiment for centuries .
They verify or falsify your findings , and you proceed with further experimentation .
You do n't have to ' believe ' anything about it , before , during , or after .
In this way , the contemplative traditions have evolved over millennia .
They are in harmony with rationality and science , and generally welcome any methodology that might increase our knowledge of the visible & invisible Kosmos .
5 , Everybody starts at the bottom .
Even if everyone in the World became Mensa - level enlightened today , every baby born tomorrow would have to begin at square one , and develop the old fashioned way .
So far , we have n't figured out a way to skip developmental levels .
However , we move through them faster than we used to .
For instance , John Ashcroft may be a poster child for the low - level of Mythic religion , but a mere 100,000 years ago there WAS NO Mythic level of religion .
It had n't even emerged yet .
Even 3,000 years ago , George Bush Jr. would have been one of the most evolved people on the planet .
Not so much now .
Now Mythic Religion is like , totally a crappy low level of consciousness , and most nine year olds or U.S. Presidents have access to it , thanks to recapitulation .
Recapitulation ?
When we 're born , we basically get a free pass to evolve up to the prevailing center of consciousness in the population .
The level of consciousness we are immersed in ( in the family we are born into , in the culture we live in , etc ) exerts a developmental gravity .
And that gravity pulls us up to it .
But , when you try to evolve beyond it , to higher altitudes of consciousness , then that same center of gravity drags you back down to it .
If you are below it , it lifts you up .
Rise above , it will try to pull you back down .
That 's why Mythic religious peeps are freaking out .
Their World ( view ) is vanishing like millions of species God gave them Reign over .
Eventually ( if they do n't destroy humanity first , with their lust for an apocalypse ) , mythic religion will become about as important to future generations as magic is to us .
Magic should be used in Harry Potter movies , not for the religious murder of Tanzanian Albinos .
Mythic religion should be a history lesson , not the guiding belief of a U.S. President .
That 's why Bill Maher 's movie Religulous is funny :
It 's pointing out the fact that there are a LOT of people living with a World View that went out of style in 1637 ( thanks , Descartes ! ) .
Bill Maher is hilariously pointing out the fact that religion is literally retarded , because it is developmentally arrested .
I mean , it would be hilarious , if it were n't so appallingly true .
Evidence indicates 70 % of the world is at a Mythic ( or lower ) level of development .
And they are religious !
If we get these five simple points into the debate about religion , I think it would help eliminate some confusion .
A new investigative piece from Fortune describes how Manhattan resident Dina Wein Reis allegedly pulled a fast one on dozens of consumer product giants , including Procter & Gamble , Unilever , and Hershey , in " exquisitely orchestrated scams " that netted as much as $ 15 million a year .
The story came out last year , but now we know much more about how the alleged fraud went down .
Wein Reis , a self - described businesswoman , film producer , and philanthropist , was a " diverter , " a player in " the little - known but large gray market in which consumer goods are bought and sold in channels unauthorized by manufacturers .
Diversion is not necessarily illegal .
But the way Wein Reis did it was fraud , prosecutors allege . "
Here 's how it worked : Wein Reis would cold - call middle - and upper - level marketing executives with a high - paying job offer to replace her as the head of her conglomerate .
After flying them to New York to discuss , she 'd also persuade them to sell her their company 's merchandise at huge discounts , promising to give the products to schools , senior centers , Native American reservations , or military bases as part of a " sampling program . "
She would then resell the goods to other middle - men .
Wein Reis also told the sellers that if the program were successful , the companies would gain exclusive access to these hard - to - reach markets through her " National Distribution Program , " which did n't exist .
Some of those duped were Roche , who says Wein Reis bilked it out of $ 10 million of diabetes - testing equipment ; Unilever , which put its losses at $ 2.23 million in a deal involving detergent ; and Procter & Gamble says it handed over several million dollars ' worth of shampoo .
Some juicy details :
The feds have uncovered more than 100 bank accounts , some overseas .
She used multiple aliases to run more than 100 shell companies .
FBI agents carted off scores of necklaces and watches , a pair of Louis XVI footstools , two Bugatti throne chairs , a pair of Empire sleigh beds , and a 1920s cast - iron vanity from Reis ' six - story Beaux Arts townhouse on the Upper West Side .
She has luxurious homes in Westhampton Beach , N.Y. , Bal Harbor , Fla. , and Jerusalem .
Her Manhattan townhouse was featured in Architectural Digest .
She cultivated friendships in New York society , hosting lavish parties for the Whitney Museum of American Art .
It 's not quite on the scale as Madoff or Stanford , but the scheme appears just as brazen .

School - lunch chef Ann Cooper ( watch her talk from EG’07 ) has been touring the US this summer , asking locals to change their approach to food in schools .
Her own revolutionary school lunch program , in which kids eat local produce and fresh bread , has taken hold in Berkeley , California ; Cooper just moved to Boulder , Colorado , to revamp that lunch system .
To help other school systems transform their own meal programs , she just launched a beta version of The Lunch Box , a website from her nonprofit F3 : Food Family Farming Foundation .
Inside The Lunch Box are budget models , menus and lots of recipes — enter the number of servings you need , and the recipe page calculates how much of each ingredient you ’ll need .
( Meatloaf for 600 , anyone ? )
On Sept. 24 in Houston , Cooper will talk about the project at the Tinsley Elementary School .
Watch Ann Cooper below and catch her enthusiasm for feeding kids good food :
Renate Matzke - Karasz from Ludwig- Maximilians - Universität Munich has led an international team of scientists who are studying sperm specimens from the London Natural History Museum ’s collections .
Their research has revealed fossilized evidence for reproduction using giant sperm in a group of small aquatic crustaceans , called ostracods , dating back to 100 million years ago .
The international team analyzed Harbinia micropapillosa specimens from the Cretaceous Period that had remains of the soft body intact .
These fossils had been collected , investigated and then donated to the Natural History Museum in 2000 by Robin Smith , now at the Lake Biwa Museum , Japan , a member of the research team .
Eight years later , the same specimens were analyzed using synchrotron X - ray holotomography at the European Synchrotron Radiation Facility ( ESRF ) in Grenoble , through collaboration with Paul Tafforeau , a palaeontologist at the ESRF .
This method is currently the most powerful and sensitive way to investigate in three dimensions and at a microscopic scale , the internal anatomy of exceptional fossils without damaging them .
Synchrotron holotomography represents a virtual longitudinal section through the 100 million - year - old fossil ostracod Harbinia micropapillosa .
The left arrow shows the preserved inner part of the oesophagus , while the right arrow points to the two seminal receptacles , where this female stored the giant sperm cells after mating .
Credit and copyright : R. Matzke - KaraszMatzke - Karasz said , " In these microfossils , we detected organs that are required for transferring giant spermatozoa .
Since modern ostracods still produce giant sperm and manoeuvre them with the same organs as 100 million years ago , it ’s safe to say this distinctive feature evolved only once in this group .
It seems to be an evolutionarily successful reproduction strategy , even though it comes at an exceedingly high price for both genders , as a lot of energy is invested in producing and carrying such enormous sperm . "
“ Holotomography is a non-destructive imaging technique like computer tomography ( CT ) , but we use powerful and coherent synchrotron X - rays leading to a sensitivity thousand times higher , ” explains Paul Tafforeau of ESRF .
“ It is since very recently that palaeontologists use this technique to image fossils , but the results achieved so far show that this technique will surely lead to many important discoveries on fossils , ” he adds .
The X - ray examination of the fossilized ostracods revealed direct parallels with the complex reproductive apparatus of modern relatives of these Cretaceous fossils .
The team also came across something of a surprise : two of the female specimens had inflated cavities that only occur in modern ostracods that have recently mated , meaning fossil evidence for an insemination had been uncovered .
Although the Cretaceous Santana Formation in Brazil is famous for its exceptionally preserved fish , it also yields ostracod fossils with preserved softparts – a very rare occurrence .
The species Harbinia micropapillosa , here depicted as a scanning electron micrograph , reveals stunning details of the appendages .
Now , a synchrotron holotomographic investigation showed that even internal organs can still be identified .
The investigated fossils are housed by the Natural History Museum in London .
Copyright : NHM , London .
The team was completed by Radka Symonová , scientist at the Charles University in Prague and Giles Miller , Micropalaeontology Curator at the Natural History Museum .
A human sperm would have to be over 17 meters long in order to measure up against one group of modern ostracods , whose sperm are up to ten times as big as the animals themselves .
Roughly 34,000 of the 50 micron - long human sperm would have to line up to match the body length of a man ( of 1,70 m ) .
The next stage of the research from the international team is to understand why and how reproduction with giant sperm has persisted for so long .
The research was led by Ludwig - Maximilians - Universität Munich and received funding from the ESRF ( Grenoble ) , the European Union in the scope of the Marie Curie RT Network SEXASEX and the Lake Biwa Museum , Japan . •
Twenty - one specimens from the Natural History Museum ’s micropalaeontology collection were used for the research and five of the specimens showed internal evidence of sexual organs •

Modern animals that reproduce with giant sperm include featherwing beetles , several frogs , moths and backswimmer species , ostracods and fruit flies , such as Drosophila bifurca , whose sperm measures around six centimetres while the fly is only a few millimetres in length .
One of the most violent but beautiful reminders that we live on a geologically restless planet are volcanic eruptions .
Around 550 volcanoes have erupted at least once in historic times , and around 50 or 60 are active each year .
On any given day , as many as 10 volcanoes may be spewing ash or lava somewhere on Earth .
Some volcanoes , such as Mount Etna in Italy , erupt almost constantly for years on end .
Others , like Mount St. Helens , erupt rarely and sometimes extremely destructively .
Like Etna and Mount St. Helens , many of the most dangerous and explosive erupters are stratovolcanoes , which are made of layers of ash and lava from previous eruptions .
They tend to be steep - sided cone - shaped volcanoes and often rise strikingly above the surrounding landscape .
Many of the stunning images of eruptions captured from space are of violent stratovolcanoes , such as the one above of Kliuchevskoi , the most active volcano on Russia ’s Kamchatka peninsula .
The image above was taken by astronauts on the space shuttle Endeavour in 1994 , as an eruption was just getting underway .
The ash plume reached as high as 50,000 feet .

Augustine Volcano is a 4,100 - foot - tall , 7 - mile - wide stratovolcano .
This eruption was captured by NASA ’s Terra satellite in 2006 .
Augustine ’s dome collapsed in 1883 , during its largest historical eruption .
It has been erupting for at least 40,000 years .
The island ’s jagged edges were created by massive avalanches .
Augustine lies in the Cook Inlet at the eastern end of the Aleutian trench which marks the northernmost portion of the Pacific Ring of Fire .
Volcanic activity here is caused by the subduction of the Pacific plate beneath the North American plate .
As the wet ocean crust descends into the molten mantle below , superheated water is squeezed out and rises up to melt the bottom of the continental crust , creating magma that drives the volcanic eruptions .

Astronauts aboard the International Space Station caught a lucky glimpse of the start of this eruption of Sarychev Volcano in the Kuril Islands , northeast of Japan , on June 12 , 2009 .
This was the volcano ’s first eruption in 30 years .
The smooth white cloud , known as a pileus cloud , topping the eruption column may be made of water condensation caused by rising and cooling of the air above .
In contrast , a dark gray cloud of ash near the ground is probably an avalanche of hot ash and rock known as a pyroclastic flow .
This photo sparked a debate among scientists about what caused the hole in the clouds above the eruption .
Three possible options came up :
It could have nothing to do with the eruption and simply be caused by the contrast in temperatures between the ocean and the island .
A shockwave from the eruption could have blown a hole in the cloud deck .
As the plume rose , air flowed downward along the sides and became warmer and evaporated the clouds .

Alaska ’s Redoubt Volcano erupted five times in one night this year after almost three decades of relative quiet .
It continued erupting on and off for weeks afterward .
This image was taken by the commercial satellite GeoEye - 1 on March 30 when the ash reached heights of 27,000 feet .
The volcano ’s alert level is still “ advisory , ” and the aviation color code is yellow .
Redoubt is a 10,200 - foot tall stratovolcano 100 miles southwest of Anchorage in the Aleutian Range , west of the Cook Inlet .

Mount Etna is the second tallest volcano in Europe , at almost 11,000 feet .
It is one of the most active volcanoes in the world and is erupting nearly continuously .
It is no surprise that there are many great photos of this volcano erupting , including this one captured by astronauts on the International Space Station in 2002 .
The lighter colored plumes of smoke on the slope of the volcano in this picture are from forest fires ignited by lava .
Etna is a stratovolcano located on the island of Sicily .
It is one of the most studied volcanoes in the world and .
at 500,000 years old , it may also be the oldest - known active volcano .

A NASA astronaut spotted this eruption of Cleveland Volcano from the International Space Station in 2006 .
The volcano is 5,700 feet high and claimed the only known eruption - related death in Alaska ’s Aleutian Islands in 1944 .
Its symmetrical , cone shape is typical of stratovolcanoes .

Popocatépetl , which means “ smoking mountain ” in the Aztec language , is a very active volcano just 44 miles outside Mexico City .
The second highest peak in Mexico at 17,800 feet , this glacier - covered stratovolcano has erupted at least 20 times in the last 500 years and has caused multiple evacuations of the city .
This eruption in 2001 was caught by astronauts on the International Space Station , near the end of a seven - year period of frequent activity .
The plume reached heights of around 30,000 feet .

This eruption of Chaitén caldera in Chile was photographed from the International Space Station in May 2008 .
Volcanism along the west coast of South America is the result of subduction of the oceanic Nazca plate beneath the South American plate .
Chaitén was last active more than 9,000 years ago .
The violent 2008 eruption inundated the small coastal town of Chaitén with ash , pyroclastic flows and volcanic mudflows called lahars .
The caldera is relatively small at less than two miles wide , and sits on the flank of the larger Michinmahuida volcano .

This image of the Sierra Negra volcano in the Galapagos Islands was taken by NASA ’s Terra satellite in 2006 .
Sierra Negra is a shield volcano , which are made mostly of previous lava flows and tend to be broad and gently sloping .
The Galapagos are part of an island chain formed by a hot spot where a plume of hot mantle rises up and melts the base of the ocean crust .
As the Pacific plate moves over the relatively stationary hot spot , volcanoes are formed .
The Hawaiian Islands were formed — and continue forming — the same way .

One argument some Xbox 360 owners have against the DualShock 3 is the lack of “ triggers ” for the lower shoulder buttons .
Gioteck has remedied this issue nicely and any shooter fan should not be without RealTriggers .
The installation procedure for RealTriggers could not be simpler .
Just clip them on your R2 and L2 buttons and you are done .
Generally they stay securely fashioned , but on occasion they will pop off .
Be careful , it could be a choke hazard for a little one roaming your domicile .
After using the RealTriggers for a few months there are few games that do not benefit from it .
Shooters are an immediate great fit and driving games benefit quite nicely from the extended reach .
Some games that require us of both R1 and R2 or L1 and L2 at similar times may not provide the same benefits .
Killzone 2 and Resistance 2 are two games that the real triggers both give immediate benefits to .
Warhawk , on the other hand , was n’t as good as an experience when piloting .
It ’s nice to have the option to take them off when necessary .
They are priced right at only $ 4.99 .

SULTAN , Wash . --
A big public utility is on the cusp of building a hydroelectric - power plant on a picture - perfect stream in the Pacific Northwest , but the plan has yet to draw the usual opposition .
That is in part because the approved project , which involves building a dam on a tributary called Youngs Creek , is so small and remote that it has attracted little notice .
It will generate only about 7.5 megawatts of power at its peak , enough electricity to power between 3,500 and 7,500 homes .
By contrast , the much bigger Henry ...
I consider I 've been pretty lucky in the genetic lottery .
Sure , I 'm as near to ovoid as an erect hominid can physically manage but , while my parents gifted me with male pattern baldness , the capacious eyebags of a dolorous spaniel and a two - inch lateral scoliosis , I also have a resonant baritone singing voice and an excellent memory for trivia .
Best of all I seem to have missed out two traits that trouble normal mortals : I do n't do guilt and I 've yet to find a food that disgusts me .
This is good news for a food writer - pretty much anything from Japanese natto to recently smothered ortolans are going to be fair game .
Which is why I was so sanguine when Guardian Films asked me to eat snails .
C'mon guys .
Try harder .
I 've done the lot .
Mum says I ate them raw in the garden at two ; I can hoik down a couple of dozen petits gris without pausing to suck the garlic butter out of my moustache ; hell I 've even foraged my own garden snails and fed them to my daughter .
Ah yes , said the director , but what if they weighed about a kilo each and were as big as two clenched fists ?
Have you tried Giant African Land Snails ?
I suppose the most remarkable thing about African Land Snails is how much they resemble the rest of the family .
Physiologically they appear identical , just , frankly , sodding huge .
The ' foot ' , the rubbery appendage with which your average garden snail can cling to a rock or , we are told , slide unharmed along the edge of a razor is at least as big as the palm of your hand .
This is important because this is the bit that , according to my expert guide Abiodun Olawunmi of the admirable A2 Delicious restaurant in London 's glittering Catford , was the only part we were going to eat .
I 'd gladly fill you in on the whole process of shell smashing , guts removal , washing with alum rocks and boiling for ages but you'd be better off watching the video above for the full , rather astonishing effect .
So the final and most important question is , how did it taste ?
Well it did n't , exactly .
Like whelks , boulets , garden snails and pretty much the rest of the edible gastropodia , there 's not a chance that any evanescent snailish essence could survive the rigmarole of desliming and rendering edible - but that 's not the point .
The remaining texture was utterly unlike anything else I 've ever put in my mouth .
Abi's hot pepper sauce was a gently brewed assault of flavours that would have converted a well - worn espadrille into a worthwhile meal .
In fact I 'll go on record saying that I 'm prepared to eat a McDonald 's hashbrown thingy if Abi 's sauce is to hand , but the snail 's foot adds a textural matrix somewhere between an undercooked artichoke heart and the cartilage from a premiership footballer 's knee - with just a tad more disquieting crunch .
Did I enjoy it ?
Hell yes .
It 's rare to find a totally new combination of flavour and texture and it was privilege to be shown how to prepare it properly .
Will I be knocking up land snail at my next dinner party ?
I 'm ashamed to say , no .
I 'm not sure I could find anyone to share it , but do try Abi 's sauce with a less challenging protein - I did chicken thighs last night - and I guarantee you wo n't be disappointed .
For two decades he was considered to be above the petty political squabbles , a cautious elder contemplating questions of faith and Islam while guiding his nation into the future .
But Ayatollah Ali Khamenei , whose title of supreme leader makes him Iran ’s ultimate authority , has gotten his hands dirty .
His decision in recent weeks to so stridently support the nation ’s controversial president after a disputed election has dramatically changed his image among his people , setting in motion an unpredictable series of events that could fundamentally change the Islamic Republic .
“ Public respect for him has been significantly damaged , ” said one analyst , speaking on condition of anonymity .
“ Opposing him is no longer the same as opposing God . ”
The venerated Khamenei has even become the target of public jokes and criticism .
Advertisement
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad “ commits crimes , and the leader supports him , ” was a popular slogan during the riots of June 20 , the day after Khamenei delivered a blistering Friday sermon in which he said that the election a week earlier had been won by Ahmadinejad .
At July 9 demonstrations , protesters mocked the ayatollah ’s son , Mojtaba , who many believe hopes to succeed his father .
‘ Khamenei - jad ’
In seeking to fill the robes of the Islamic Republic ’s late founder , Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini , Khamenei has never been deemed to have the same level of religious credentials or oratorical skills .
Over the last two decades , he has invested more in building up support among the nationalistic leaderships of the Revolutionary Guard , security apparatus and militias than in cultivating a clerical establishment that increasingly reflects the values and aspirations of modern Iran .
Advertisement
But his decision to tilt heavily toward raw force rather than the power of the turban has exposed a dilemma .
His right to rule is based on Khomeini ’s theological concept of velayat-e faqih , guardianship of religious jurists , which places him as a spiritual guide hovering above the political structure .
Now , for many , Khamenei has lost his aura of infallibility and is seen as just one more political infighter -- “ Khamenei - jad , ” as one commentator in the capital joked , combining his name and that of his controversial protege .
“ It ’s gotten so bad that people stare at me on the street thinking because I ’m a cleric I must be an Ahmadinejad supporter , until I hold up my two fingers and show my support for [ opposition candidate Mir- Hossein ] Mousavi , and the people become happy , ” Ayatollah Hadi Ghaffari , a reformist cleric , told a giggling crowd in a popular audiotape distributed around the Internet and on YouTube .
“ Mr. Khamenei , you ’re making a mistake .
I am committed to guardianship of the jurisprudent more than Khamenei . . . but I might have something to say to the guardian at the time , ” he said .
Another reformist cleric , Mohsen Kadivar , told Germany ’s Der Spiegel magazine that Khamenei ’s decision to tie his fate to Ahmadinejad ’s disputed election win was “ a great moral , but also political , mistake . ”
Advertisement
Reformist journalist Issa Saharkhiz , who was recently jailed , wrote that Khamenei “ has chosen the path of tyranny which the people of Iran and the world have already thrown into the waste bin of history several times . ”
Few believe the Islamic Republic is on the verge of collapse or revolution .
The military , numerous high - ranking clerics and segments of the population continue to support the absolute power of the leader .
But recent developments might make it difficult for Ahmadinejad to govern , much less implement the hard - line agenda he shares with Khamenei of tightening social restrictions and confronting the West .
“ Khamenei has always ruled from a position of insecurity vis-a - vis his clerical contemporaries and also the population , ” said Karim Sadjadpour , an Iran analyst at the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace who has studied much of Khamenei ’s writings .
“ Now he ’s in a situation where not only is he disliked , but he no longer elicits the same fear that he did before the election . ”
Advertisement
Broader opposition
The threats to Khamenei no longer come from just the reformists .
Even some staunch Ahmadinejad supporters said they were disheartened by Khamenei ’s decision to play such a key role in blessing the controversial election results .
One Iranian conservative , who spoke on condition of anonymity , said that “ it diminished the office ” of the House of the Leader , the supreme leader ’s headquarters , meant to be revered by Shiite Muslims .
“ He has lost a remarkable number of his own religious and traditional walks of people who had traditionally been supporters of the Islamic system in Iran , ” said Bizhan Bidabad , an Iranian intellectual in Tehran .
As Khamenei ’s credibility and powers of persuasion with moderates have collapsed , so has his ability to keep protesters under control without the truncheons and tear gas of the security forces .
With Khamenei ’s golden halo gone , the Revolutionary Guard and its allied radicals might figure he no longer serves a purpose , said one political analyst .
Advertisement
“ I think that Khamenei is finished as a politician , ” he said , speaking on condition of anonymity .
“ He has always played the role of a balancer .
Now that he ’s removing one part of the balancing act , the remaining actors might decide at some point that they are better off without him . ”
Portions of the Iranian population have long quietly resented Khamenei because they opposed the Islamic Republic ’s theocratic constrictions , but for the better part of two decades his political views remained ambiguous , even nebulous .
That changed after the election , when he blessed the vote even before it was officially ratified and delivered a momentous speech in which he personally stood up for Ahmadinejad , who won amid fraud charges , and described the president ’s views as “ closer ” to his .
“ It was not the right decision to congratulate the current president prior to the ratification of the election result , ” said Mohammad - Ali Dadkhah , a human rights lawyer , days before he was jailed .
“ The supreme leader made a prejudgment , not a judgment . ”
The president ’s opponents took on his challenge and continued questioning the vote , damaging the supreme leader ’s personal credibility by forcing him and his adjutants to make further defenses of the election results .
Advertisement
“ For nearly two decades Khamenei has wielded power without accountability , ” Sadjadpour said .
“ Those days are over .
Formerly sacred red lines have been crossed .
For the first time , people have begun openly questioning whether Emperor Khamenei has any clothes on . ”
While direct anger at Khamenei has been rare over the years , people are now shouting slogans against him from rooftops .
One political cartoon making its way around the Internet shows him riding double on a motorcycle with a club - wielding Ahmadinejad , likening the pair to the Basiji militiamen who have stormed crowds of demonstrators .
Pondering next step
Khamenei ’s allies seem at a loss over whether to bandage his hemorrhaging legitimacy by singing his praises or utilizing the blunt instruments of state .
Despite jailings and beatings , Iranian authorities have yet to squelch vocal defiance of Khamenei ’s order to end debates and protests over the election .
Notably , it has been mostly military officials and not clerics who have rushed to the system ’s defense , denouncing Mousavi ’s green - bedecked supporters as subversives .

“ The green movement was intent on piling pressure on supreme leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and the Islamic establishment , ” Gen. Yadollah Javani , a hard - line commander of the Revolutionary Guard , said this month .
“ The sedition ’s eye was injured but it was not blinded .
Now we have to blind it totally before gouging it out . ”

Political reporter , BBC News , Lib Dem conference
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
Liberal Democrat leader Nick Clegg has rejected an appeal from his Tory counterpart David Cameron for their two parties to work together .
Mr Cameron urged the Lib Dems to join the Tories in a new " national movement " claiming there was " barely a cigarette paper " between them on many issues .
But Mr Clegg insisted in an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr the Tories were totally different from his party .
Mr Clegg said the Lib Dems were the true " progressives " in UK politics .
But he refused to discuss whether he would enter coalition talks with either Labour or the Tories in the event of a hung Parliament after the next general election .
In an article for The Observer , Mr Cameron said the two parties shared the same views in areas like civil liberties , education and climate change .
But Mr Clegg , who stepped up his attacks on Mr Cameron at the start of his party 's annual conference in Bournemouth , calling him a " conman " and a " phoney " , rejected the Tory leader 's overtures .
He questioned Mr Cameron 's commitment to environmental issues , accusing him of joining forces with " climate change deniers " in the European Parliament .
And on civil liberties , he said : " There is a profound hypocrisy to say ' we 're all liberal now ' on civil liberties , when they want to actually destroy one of the cornerstones that protects British liberties in the Human Rights Act . "
Mr Clegg has angered left - wingers in his party by calling for " savage " spending cuts and saying he is considering dropping the party 's commitment to scrap university tuition fees in order to save £ 2.5 bn .
Former leader Charles Kennedy told the Andrew Marr programme it could lose the party votes from young people and blunt its attack against Labour .
And Evan Harris , a member of the party 's Federal Policy Committee , which has the final say on what goes in the manifesto , said the party would not accept any move to drop the tuition fee pledge .
" Leaders of the Liberal Democrats do n't always get their way , " he told the BBC News channel .
' Life chances '
But Mr Clegg said that although he thought tuition fees were " pernicious " , scrapping them may not be affordable in the current climate - though he stressed that the overall education budget would not be cut under the Lib Dems .
And he described proposals by the Schools Secretary , Ed Balls , to cut senior staff jobs in schools to save up to £ 2bn as " extraordinary " .
He said it would be " absolute madness to blight the life chances of the young " .
Mr Clegg also confirmed that his party wanted to cut the number of MPs from nearly 646 to 500 , and to close what he called huge tax loopholes so as to stop ordinary taxpayers " subsidising the wealthy " .
The Lib Dem leader has been setting out plans to " cut the cost of politics " by nearly £ 2bn , including closing 10 government departments and 90 quangos , axing spin doctors and no longer paying the Opposition leader 's wages out of the public purse .
The savings would be enough to renovate 200 schools a year , he said .
Quangos Cutting the cost of politics is one of David Cameron 's key themes .
The Tory leader has said he would cut ministerial salaries and reduce the number of MPs , as well as slashing quangos .
Labour has also vowed to squeeze Whitehall spending .
Mr Clegg says he would freeze ministers ' salaries and cut the number of them on the government payroll from more than 100 to 73 .
He would also halve the number of departmental spin doctors .
He told BBC News : " We could save billions by scrapping entire government departments and culling quangos .
" Doing politics differently and saving money means dismantling Labour 's spin machine by halving the number of government press officers and making political parties pay for their own special advisers . "
The Liberal Democrats went into the 2005 election promising to close eight government departments , including what was then the Department of Trade and Industry , but the latest proposals go slightly further .
Mr Clegg says he wants to cut the number of government departments from 24 to 14 .
Quangos he wants to see culled include regional development agencies - a long - standing policy commitment - but also less well - known bodies such as the School Food Trust , Teachers TV , the Independent Advisory Group on Teenage Pregnancy , the Civil Nuclear Constabulary and the Covent Garden Market Authority .
The document also proposes a reduction in the budget of the Serious and Organised Crime Agency .

On Monday 3rd August the government outlined its new proposals for a ‘ points system ’ through which immigrants to the United Kingdom can seek citizenship .
The ‘ points system ’ will see migrants ‘ earning ’ their citizenship in a ‘ probation ’ period following a five - year stay , as opposed to the current set - up whereby five years of working in the country automatically entitles them to apply .
The system will reward those who can fill in gaps in skilled jobs and who are willing to move to areas with labour shortages – a blatant display of the business imperatives behind the use of immigration controls , shepherding the workforce – as well as extending the usual demands on immigrants to pass an exam on the UK ’s history and constitution and the use of the English language ( this despite the huge cuts in English for Speakers of Other Languages provision ) .
One particularly worrying new development , however , is that the new measures will see immigrants subject to state approval of their political activities , with bonus points for “ playing a role in the democratic life of the country ” via “ membership of political parties and trade unions ” and minus points for what the government deems “ bad behaviour ” , which may include even legal protests and activism .
On Radio 4 ’s Today programme , Immigration Minister Phil Woolas explained : “ It ’s right to say if we are asking the new citizen to have an oath of allegiance to that country , that it ’s right to try to define in some objective terms what that means .
Clearly an acceptance of the democratic rule of law and the principle behind that we think is important , and we think it ’s fair to ask that . ”
When probed by interviewer Sarah Montague : “ Are you effectively saying to people who want to have a British passport , ‘ You can have one , and when you ’ve got one you can demonstrate as much as you like , but until then do n’t ’ ? ”
Mr Woolas clarified : “ In essence , yes . ”
Commenting on the story the Guardian , Times and the free London papers all carried the rather anonymous line that “ it has been suggested that immigrants who took part in anti-war demonstrations could jeopardise their chances of qualifying for citizenship ” : a ‘ suggestion ’ clearly briefed by the Labour government itself .
The idea that even legal anti-war demonstrations could be deemed “ bad behaviour ” on the grounds that they show a lack of allegiance to the United Kingdom can only mean that similar punishment would be levied on those whose “ membership of political parties and trade unions ” does not meet the Home Office ’s approval .
This is the reality of modern establishment ‘ anti-racism ’ : hard - working , loyal immigrants who do n’t speak out of turn are welcome to come and be trampled on by bosses , and maybe even have their cultural sensitivities tolerated or patronised to a certain degree via the tribune of community leaders cosy with the Labour Party : but anyone who wants to be not just ‘ tolerated ’ , but treated as an equal , can go back where they came from .
After the recent police raids and deportations of migrant cleaning workers at SOAS and at the Willis building in the City of London ( who ISS and Mitie , respectively , had willingly employed illegally at low wages up to the point where their union activity began to put the squeeze on profits ) , it is quite clear that the state and its border controls are totally at the service of management .
The ‘ points system ’ will certainly discriminate against ‘ troublemakers ’ , that is to say , anyone who engages in effective class - struggle organising , standing up for themselves rather than meekly lobbying the great and good ( what Labour thinks “ democratic life ” means ) .
Government discrimination against ‘ troublemakers ’ but rewards for loyal business - unionism could wreak havoc within the labour movement and attempts at migrant - worker organising , in particular those willing to take action to defend themselves even without union bureaucrats ’ backing .
While the Tories condemned the measures as soft on illegal immigrants , the Liberal Democrats ’ Chris Huhne argued that “ There should be no question of barring people because they criticise government policy .
Democratic values must come first ” : but what does he have to say about the constant police raids and deportations used by the ruling class terrify illegal immigrants into submission , and which already deny them their democratic rights every single day ?
In a typical display of the hollowness of ruling class liberalism , Huhne qualified his comments with the claim that the government has “ no idea how to deal with the hundreds of thousands of illegal immigrants living here ” as if they were some abstract social malaise to be cleaned up rather than real people with rights equal to anyone else .
As opposed to the recent reports , much - vaunted by the GMB and Unite as well as the Strangers into Citizens campaign , that a one - off amnesty for illegal immigrants would be more cost - effective for the government than deporting them en masse , or the idea that migrants should be given the ‘ right ’ to ‘ earn ’ permanent residence in the UK , we argue without qualification that everyone has the right to live and work wherever they like , whether or not the government deems them sufficiently economically useful or loyal to the British state .
Rather than playing the game of more lenient measures or special treatment for some ( implying police raids and ‘ detention centre ’ prisons for the rest ) the left must uncompromisingly and loudly militate against all border controls and the right of the state to police the free movement of people .
Imagine that your doctor has suggested a genetic test for mutations that can cause hereditary breast cancer .
This simple test could give you life - saving information .
But you ca n’t have it .
Because you do n’t happen to have several thousand dollars just lying around .
Why would you need thousands of dollars for one test ?
Because a private company actually owns a PATENT on the genes involved .
And , for access to those genes , they ’ll charge as much as they can get away with .
You would n’t think something occuring naturally could be patented , right ?
Well , it turns out that about 20 % of all human genes , including genes associated with Alzheimer ’s and asthma , are patented and held by private companies .
And the ACLU hopes to change that , with a lawsuit filed last month against two private companies that hold the patents for the genes that cause hereditary breast and ovarian cancer .
The hope is that this will not only overturn these particular patent rights , but that the courts will rule that giving private companies patents over large portions of the human genome is unconstitutional .
The ACLU says that patenting the genes limits the free flow of information , and is therefore in violation of the First Amendment .
In an article at CNN.com , ACLU Executive Director Anythony D. Romero summed it up : " Knowledge about our own bodies and the ability to make decisions about our health care are some of our most personal and fundamental rights .
The government should not be granting private entities control over something as personal and basic to who we are as our genes . "
It ’s ridiculous that these companies were able to get these patents in the first place .
After all , it ’s not like they created anything new — all they did was observe something that already existed .
And now they can decide who has access , which of course narrows the pool of researchers searching for a cure .
Outside researchers must request permission before they can even look at the genes .
That ’s bad enough .
But it gets even dicier when you consider that this question of access could be a question of life or death for some women .
About 5 - 10 % of breast cancer cases are hereditary , and many of those cases are linked to two particular genes .
Myriad Genetics , the company that holds patents for the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2 ( which often cause breast and ovarian cancer ) , charges $ 3,000 a pop for testing .
Your doctor might recommend genetic testing to find the mutations that cause cancer , but if you ca n’t cough up thousands of dollars , you might never know in time to make crucial health decisions .
Holding patents on these genes means Myriad stands to make a lot of money .
In protecting a potential cash cow , who knows how long they ’re drawing out the search for a cure — just think of all the research that could be underway if outside scientists did n’t have to go through all of the business red tape .
And just think of all the women who could be making lifesaving choices — if they could afford the testing .

Climate Depot 's Inconvenient Rebuttal to ' National Security ' Climate Argument
Climate Depot Editorial
Desperation time has arrived for the promoters of man-made global warming fears .
As the science of man-made climate fears continues to collapse , new tactics are being contrived to try to drum up waning public support .
A series of inconvenient developments for the promoters of man-made global warming fears continues unabated , including new peer - reviewed studies , real world data , a growing chorus of scientists dissenting ( including more UN IPCC scientists ) , open revolts in scientific societies , more evidence that rising CO2 is a boon for the atmosphere , and the Earth ’s failure to warm .
In addition , public opinion continues to turn against climate fear promotion and even activists at green festivals are now expressing doubts over man-made climate fears and a Nobel Prize - winning economist is wishing for ‘ tornadoes ’ and ‘ a lot of horrid things ’ to convince Americans of a climate threat .
( See “ Related Links ” at bottom of this article for more inconvenient scientific developments . )
The core of the claims made in the August 8 , 2009 New York Times article by John M. Broder are stated as follows : “ Recent war games and intelligence studies conclude that over the next 20 to 30 years , vulnerable regions , particularly sub-Saharan Africa , the Middle East and South and Southeast Asia , will face the prospect of food shortages , water crises and catastrophic flooding driven by climate change that could demand an American humanitarian relief or military response . ”
The heart of the “ national security ” argument is merely a redux of the 1970 ’s laughable scares about famines and resource scarcity .
Those same baseless claims and fear mongering arguments are simply being shamelessly updated with a military uniform .
It is sad to see members of our armed forces wearing their uniforms promoting such unsubstantiated and embarrassing drivel .
( See : ‘ Just When You Thought Global Warming Could n’t Get More Stupid , In Walks John Kerry ’ : ‘ Of all the ridiculous arguments in support of climate legislation , national security has to be the most idiotic ’ :

Climate Depot ’s Inconvenient Rebuttal to “ National Security ” Climate Argument :
1 ) The “ national security ” angle is based on unproven computer models which even the United Nations IPCC admits are not “ predictions . ”
UN IPCC lead author , Dr. Kevin Trenberth refers to climate models as “ story lines . ”
“ In fact there are no predictions by IPCC at all .
And there never have been .
The IPCC instead proffers ‘ what if ’ projections of future climate that correspond to certain emissions scenarios , ” Trenberth wrote in journal Nature ’s blog on June 4 , 2007 .
So the mighty New York Times is reporting that some members of the military , led by Sen .
Kerry , are essentially playing no more than “ what if ” “ war games ! ”
Memo to New York Times and Senator Kerry : Climate Models “ predictions ” are not evidence .
In addition , Ivy league forecasting pioneer Dr. Scott Armstrong of the University of Pennsylvania , found that the climate models used by UN IPCC to make these scary “ predictions ” or “ what if projections ” of the future , violate the basic principles of forecasting .
“ Of 89 principles [ of forecasting ] , the UN IPCC violated 72 , ” Armstrong ’s research revealed on January 28 , 2009 .

2 ) Aside from the fact that the “ national security ” angle rests on speculative doomsday scenarios , perhaps the biggest whopper of the new movement is the implication that we must pass the Congressional climate bill to “ address ” or “ remedy ” the problem and thus “ avoid ” future wars and loss of life .
Left unanswered in this argument is how a climate bill that will have no detectable impact on global temperatures will help “ solve ” the alleged looming national security threat .
Most shockingly , the Congressional climate bill would not even impact atmospheric CO2 levels according to the EPA !
3 ) The New York Time also makes the following remarkable assertion : “ But a growing number of policy makers say that the world ’s rising temperatures , surging seas and melting glaciers are a direct threat to the national interest . ”
NYT Claim : “ World ’s Rising temperatures ? ” : Huh ?
Is NYT must not be privy to latest temperature data showing a lack of warming for a decade and global cooling in recent years and peer - reviewed analysis showing the 20th century was not unusually warm ?
NYT Claim : “ Surging Seas . ”
Why did NYT reporter Broder fail to do a moment ’s worth of research on the alleged “ surging seas ? ”
If only Broder had taken a moment to look at the latest data .
See : ‘ No evidence for accelerated sea - level rise ’ says Royal Netherlands Meteorological Institute – December 12 , 2008 ; Report : Sea Level rise ‘ has stumbled since 2005 ’ – Meteorologist Anthony Watts – December 5 , 2008 ; Renowned Sea Level expert predicts sea level ‘ will rise in the 21st century by about 8 inches ’ – April 23 , 2009 & Global warming may not affect sea levels , study finds – January 11 , 2008 ; Plus see June 2009 comprehensive sea level report , )
NYT Claim : “ Melting Glaciers ” : Contrary to the NYT ’s assertions , many glaciers are advancing .
See : Alaskan glaciers at Icy Bay advance one - third of a mile in less than a year ; Argentina ’s Perito Moreno glacier advancing ; Hubbard Glacier in Alaska Advances ; Western Canadian glaciers advance ; ‘ Weather variations , not global warming cause Himalayan glaciers to melt ’ – August 8 , 2009 ; Research Reveals global warming not cause of Kilimanjaro glacier reduction – September 24 , 2008
4 ) The New York Times notes Sen .
Kerry and others are “ now beginning to make the national security argument for approving the [ Congressional ] legislation . ”
The ridiculous assumption that mankind could realistically reduce emissions to alter future weather patterns has been exposed as “ climate astrology . ”
It is truly an insult to our men and woman in uniform to have Sen .
Kerry and a small contingent of military brass attempting to sell these spurious climate claims .
If we suspended basic science and reality and assumed Sen .
Kerry was correct and the “ undecided ” Senators may be swayed to support a climate bill based on these alleged “ national security ” fears , how would a bill that did not impact CO2 levels or temperature be the “ solution ” ?
Sadly , the New York Times ( and the ususally dependable Broder ) did a completely one - sided article on this issue based .
NYT reporter Broder could have noted that the Waxman - Markey cap - and - trade bill is “ scientifically meaningless ” in terms of reducing temperatures .
Broder could have noted that even Obama ’s EPA has conceded that the Congressional climate bill would not even detectably reduce atmospheric CO2 levels !!
( See : EPA Administrator Lisa Jackson : “ U.S. action alone will not impact world CO2 levels . ” )
So the question looms , why would “ undecided ” Senators be swayed to vote for a climate bill for “ national security ” reasons when the bill is purely symbolic ?!
Broder irresponsibly failed to inform NYT readers of these basic truths .
( Also see :
No detectable climate impact : ‘ If we actually faced a man - made ‘ climate crisis ’ , we would all be doomed ’ & Climate policy reduced to ‘ magical solutions ’ — ‘ all about symbolism … with little or no impact on real - world outcomes ’ )
5 ) NYT ’s shameless quote of the day : “ We will pay for this one way or another , ” Gen . Anthony C. Zinni , a retired Marine and the former head of the Central Command .
“ We will pay to reduce greenhouse gas emissions today , and we ’ll have to take an economic hit of some kind .
Or we will pay the price later in military terms .
And that will involve human lives . ”
Gen . Zinni needs to do his homework on global warming claims .
Had the General done more research , he would quickly realize that the estimated 1.6 billion people in the world without electricity who are leading a nasty , brutish and short life , will be the ones who “ will pay ” for global warming solutions that prevent them from obtaining cheap and abundant carbon based energy .
( See :1 ) It is a moral issue !
– ‘ People cannot cook ’… Chad ’s Global Warming Inspired Ban on Charcoal leads to ‘ Desperate ’ Families !
– January 16 , 2009 2 ) Black clergymen protest Robert Redford ‘ link his environmentalism to racism ’
3 ) Poor Kenyans rebel as UK grocery store ’s “ carbon friendly ” policies may stop food exports – 4 ) African Activist : ‘ African life span is lower than it was in U.S. and Europe 100 years ago .
But Africans told we should n’t develop ’ because wealthy Western nations are ‘ worried about global warming ’ : ‘ Telling Africans they can’t have electricity and economic development – is immoral ; 5 ) India :
‘ It is morally wrong for us to reduce emissions when 40 % of Indians do not have access to electricity ’ ; 6 ) Obama Advisor Warren Buffett ‘ repeats criticism of cap and trade , saying it would be a huge , regressive tax ’ )
Sadly , Sen. Kerry and Gen. Zinni ’s unfounded “ national security ” climate claims will be the object of public humiliation for them in the not too distant future .
It is a testament to the growing strength of the skeptical scientific case against man-made climate fears that Sen. Kerry and retired VA Sen .
John Warner ( who sadly embarrassed himself in his final year in the Senate promulgating such “ national security ” climate drivel — see : Fmr. Sen .
Warner : ‘ There ’s a building base of evidence that global warming is contributing to much of the instability of the world today ’ ) have to resort to such transparent and yes …laughable claims .
Science and history will issue a harsh judgment against Sen .
Kerry and others for this silly “ national security ” argument .
The reality is , global warming does pose a serious national security threat to the United States — global warming “ solutions ” – that is .
The Senate is deliberating on a global warming cap - and - trade bill that will increase our dependence on foreign sources of energy , close refineries and cost American jobs .
( See Bloomberg News : report from June 26 , 2009 : U.S. oil companies may cope with the climate legislation by “ closing fuel plants , cutting capital spending and increasing imports . ”
Bloomberg also reported that “ one in six U.S. refineries probably would close by 2020 ” and this could “ add 77 cents a gallon to the price of gasoline . ” )
Former Vice President Al Gore has touted the Congressional climate bill as a first step toward “ global governance . ”
“ National security ” will be a threat to the U.S. if it contemplates an international treaty which will inevitably lead to a loss of sovereignty for the U.S. as well as the imposition of some form carbon taxes .
Americans should welcome a full debate about the merits of “ national security ” threat from man-made global warming .
The more light that is shown on this line of reasoning , the more skeptical the public will grow .
Dare we say : Bring it on !
[ Update : Meteorologist Joe D’Aleo of IceCap .
Us , notes that the new “ national security ” climate claims have a familiar ring to them .
D’Aleo writes : “ Take for example these excerpts from a 1977 book ” The Weather Conspiracy , the Coming of the New Ice Age ” written for the CIA on the consensus of the climatologists of the time that an ice age threatened to cause major migrations and mass starvations . ” ]

The diagnosis was diffuse axonal injury .
“ The textbook definition is essentially a blow that shuts down the bundle of wires responsible for keeping us conscious , ” said Dr. Jonathan Fellus , a neurologist at Kessler Institute for Rehabilitation in West Orange , N.J. , who has overseen Adam ’s gradual recovery .
“ It ’s as if the major highways have taken a hit , and now the brain has to use back roads to function .
But every brain responds differently .
I have given up making predictions . ”
Researchers who have taken images of the brain as it processes information related to personal identity have noticed that several areas are particularly active .
Called cortical midline structures , they run like an apple core from the frontal lobes near the forehead through the center of the brain .
These frontal and midline areas communicate with regions of the brain that process memory and emotion , in the medial temporal lobe , buried deep beneath each ear .
And studies strongly suggest that in delusions of identity , these emotion centers are either not well connected to frontal midline areas or not providing good information .
Mom looks and sounds exactly like Mom , but the sensation of her presence is lost .
She seems somehow unreal .
The classic delusion of identification is called Capgras syndrome , after the French psychiatrist Dr. Jean Marie Joseph Capgras , who with Dr. Jean Reboul - Lachaux described in 1923 the case of a 53 - year - old patient “ who transformed everyone in her entourage , even those closest to her , such as her husband and daughter , into various and numerous doubles . ”
In an analysis of such cases published in January in the journal Neurology , Dr. Orrin Devinsky , a neurologist at New York University , documented that people with the delusion typically have more damage to their right hemisphere than their left .
Linear reasoning and language tend to be predominantly left - hemisphere functions , while holistic judgments  of intonation , of emphasis  tend to be processed more in the right .
Dr. Devinsky argues that when people lack a familiar emotional glow in the company of a parent or loved one , the left hemisphere , unchecked by a damaged right , resolves the conflict with its categorical logic .
The person must be an impostor .
“ And if you have other damage in the cortical areas that check reality , that make judgments about what ’s right and wrong , then you have no way to correct that error , ” Dr. Devinsky said .

AHMEDABAD : A city - based restaurant claimed to have made the world 's longest dosa , 32.5 - ft - long in less than 40 minutes .
" We have made the world 's largest dosa , 32 feet and five inches long , in record time of less than 40 minutes , " CMD of Sankalp chain of restaurants , Kailash Goenka , said .
" We already hold the Guinness record for making the world 's largest dosa ��� 30 feet long in February 2006 .
Today we broke our own record and prepared a 32.5 - feet - long dosa , " Goenka said .
The dosa was named after " Quick Gun Murugun " , an upcoming movie that highlights the merits of vegetarianism .
A team of 16 chefs and eight helpers practiced for the past 10 days to get the correct length .
" In our team , we have 16 chefs who worked in tandem to prepare the dosa .
It required proper coordination among the men for spreading the batter across the hot plate simultaneously , " one of the chefs Swami Goda .
Another member of the team , Sajjan Singh , said it was difficult to handle the dosa on a 35 - feet - long hot plate ( tawa ) and to maintain a steady temperature across the length .
Sankalp restaurant first entered the Guinness Book of Records in March 1997 by making a 25 - feet - long dosa .

THE LORD OUR GOD ,
THE LORD IS ONE
When viewed without bias or preconceived ideas , the Bible reveals quite a lot about the structure of the Godhead .
Unfortunately , most people 's view of God is shaped primarily by tradition , with Scripture taking a secondary position .
Trinitarians believe that God is three distinct but inseparable persons in one being .
Binitarians , such as the Worldwide Church of God under Herbert W. Armstrong and most of the current WCG splinter groups , believe that God is a family which has been composed eternally of two separate beings , God the Father and Jesus Christ ( the Logos ) .
In the following seven sections , I 'm going to trace what the Bible has to say about this misunderstood topic .
(1) There Is Only One True God , The Father
Over and over , both the Old and New Testaments emphasize that there is only one true God .
This doctrine , which has always been fundamental to Israel 's faith , is summed up in " the Shema " ( which literally means " hear " in Hebrew ) .
Moses stated that God was one in Deuteronomy 6:4 , which is the beginning of the Shema :
DEUTERONOMY 6:4 " Hear , O Israel : The LORD our God [ ' eloheynu ] , the LORD is one !
( NKJV )
In the Scripture above , the word translated " our God " is the Hebrew word ' eloheynu .
Scholars have long assumed that ' eloheynu is a plural form of the Hebrew word ' elohim .
Because of this assumption , theologians have concluded that the Israelites understood the triune nature of God .
Trinitarians believe that this verse means that God is one being composed of three distinct but inseparable persons , the Father , Son , and Holy Spirit .
Binitarians also believe that ' eloheynu indicates a plurality , although they believe that God is one " family " currently composed of the Father and the Son .
However , both ' eloheynu and ' elohim are derivatives of the singular ' eloah , which is one of the Hebrew names for God the Father , the Most High God ( see Pro. 30:4 - 5 below ) .
' Elohim is a plural derivative of ' eloah , while ' eloheynu , the term found in Deuteronomy 6:4 , is a singular variation of ' eloah .
PROVERBS 30:4
Who has ascended into heaven , or descended ?
Who has gathered the wind in His fists ?
Who has bound the waters in a garment ?
Who has established all the ends of the earth ?
What is His name , and what is His Son 's name , if you know ?
5 Every word of God [ ' eloah ] is pure ;
He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him . ( NKJV )
In addition to revealing one of the Hebrew names for the Most High God , the passage above shows that God 's status as Father and the fact that He had a special Son was recognized by the Israelites .
This is contrary to Herbert W. Armstrong 's position that the only member of the Godhead known to ancient Israel was the Logos , who became Yeshua the Messiah .
Malachi 2:10 also shows that God 's status as Father was known :
MALACHI 2:10
Have we not all one Father ?
Has not one God created us ? . . . ( NKJV )
But how do we know that the Trinitarian theologians are wrong ?
How do we know that the Hebrew word ' eloheynu is singular ?
One of the most basic methods available for understanding the Scriptures is simply letting the Bible interpret itself .
A comparison of the Greek text found in Mark 12:29 with the Hebrew text of Deuteronomy 6:4 provides the evidence that ' eloheynu is singular and not plural .
In response to a scribe 's question about which commandment was the most important of all , Messiah repeats " the Shema " :
MARK 12:29 Jesus answered him , " The first of all the commandments is : ' Hear , O Israel , the Lord our God [ theos ] , the Lord is one . ' " ( NKJV )
The Greek word translated " God " in this verse is theos .
According to The New Analytical Greek Lexicon ( NAGL ) , this noun is singular , masculine , and in the nominative case ( p. 201 ) .
Theos in Mark 12:29 directly corresponds to ' eloheynu in Deuteronomy 6:4 .
Because the Greek equivalent theos is singular , the Hebrew ' eloheynu must also be singular , or these Scriptures contradict one another .
When you let the Bible clarify itself , it 's apparent from the Greek text of Mark 12:29 that there is only one God .
The scribe who questioned Yeshua confirms this understanding by his response :
MARK 12:32
So the scribe said to Him , " Well said , Teacher .
You have spoken the truth , for there is one God , and there is no other [ allos ] but He . " ( NKJV )
The Greek word translated " other " in verse 32 is allos , which Vine 's Complete Expository Dictionary of Old and New Testament Words ( Vine 's ) says " expresses a numerical difference and denotes ' another of the same sort ' . "
There is no other like God ;
He alone is immortal , having existed from eternity ( see I Tim. 6:16 below ) .
In Mark 12:34 , Yeshua commends the scribe for having answered wisely .
All indications from the text are that he agreed totally with what the scribe had said .
Messiah called the Father the only true God in John 17:3 and distinguished himself from Him :
JOHN 17:3 [ Yeshua said ]
" And this is eternal life , that they may know You , the only true God , and Jesus Christ whom You have sent . " ( NKJV )
Yeshua objected when the ruler called him " good " ( Matt. 19:17 , Mark 10:18 , Luke 18:19 ) , saying that there was only One who was good , God. John and Paul also made a distinction between the one true God and His son Yeshua the Messiah , as shown in the following Scriptures :
I JOHN 5:20 We know too that the Son of God has come , and has given us the power to know the true God .
We are in the true God , as we are in his Son , Jesus Christ .
This is the true God , this is eternal life .
( Jerusalem Bible )
I CORINTHIANS 8:4 . . .
We know that an idol is nothing in the world , and that there is no other God but one .
5
For even if there are so - called gods , whether in heaven or on earth ( as there are many gods and many lords ) , 6 yet for us there is one God , the Father , of whom are all things , and we for Him ; and one Lord Jesus Christ , through whom are all things , and through whom we live .
( NKJV )
EPHESIANS 4:4
There is one body and one Spirit , just as you were called in one hope of your calling ; 5 one Lord , one faith , one baptism ; 6 one God and Father of all , who is above all , and through all , and in you all .
( NKJV )
I TIMOTHY 2:5 For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men , the Man Christ Jesus , ( NKJV )
Along with Paul , James also states that there is one God :
ROMANS 3:30
Since there is one God who will justify the circumcised by faith and the uncircumcised through faith .
( NKJV )
JAMES 2:19
You believe that there is one God .
You do well .
Even the demons believe ; and tremble !
( NKJV )
(2) God Has Sons
This point is misunderstood to some degree by most Christians .
In addition to showing that there is only one true God , the Bible teaches that the Most High God has sons .
In the Old Testament , the term " sons of God " ( Heb. beney ' elim , beney ' elohim , and beney ha'elohim ) refers to the angelic host , as shown by the Scriptures below .
GENESIS 6:1
Now it came to pass , when men began to multiply on the face of the earth , and daughters were born to them , 2 that the sons of God [ beney ha'elohim ] saw the daughters of men , that they were beautiful ; and they took wives for themselves of all whom they chose . . . 4
There were giants on the earth in those days , and also afterward , when the sons of God [ beney ha'elohim ] came in to the daughters of men and they bore children to them .
Those were the mighty men who were of old , men of renown .
( NKJV ) [ For more information , refer to " Genesis 6 - Who Were ' The Sons Of God ' ? " ]
DEUTERONOMY 32:8
When the Most High gave to the nations their inheritance , when he divided mankind , he fixed the borders of the peoples according to the number of the sons of God [ beney ' elohim ] . ( ESV )
JOB 1:6
Now there was a day when the sons of God [ beney ha'elohim ] came to present themselves before the Lord , and Satan also came among them .
( NKJV )
JOB 2:1
Again there was a day when the sons of God [ beney ha'elohim ] came to present themselves before the Lord , and Satan came also among them to present himself before the Lord . ( NKJV )
JOB 38:4
" Where were you when I laid the foundations of the earth ?
Tell Me , if you have understanding .
5
Who determined its measurements ?
Surely you know !
Or who stretched the line upon it ?
6
To what were its foundations fastened ?
Or who laid its cornerstone , 7 when the morning stars sang together , and all the sons of God [ beney ' elohim ] shouted for joy ?
( NKJV )
PSALM 29:1 O give the Lord you sons of God [ beney ' elim ] , give the Lord glory and power ; 2 give the Lord the glory of his name .
Adore the Lord in his holy court .
( The Psalms : A New Translation )
PSALM 89:5
The heavens proclaim your wonders , O Lord ; the assembly of your holy ones proclaims your truth .
6
For who in the skies can compare with the Lord or who is like the Lord among the sons of God [ beney ' elim ] ? ( The Psalms : A New Translation )
The New Testament expands the concept of God 's family by showing that humans can also become sons of God , just like the angels .
In Luke 20:35 - 36 , Yeshua states that humans who attain the first resurrection will be " equal to the angels " and will be sons of God , just as the Old Testament shows the angels are :
LUKE 20:35
" But those who are counted worthy to attain that age , and the resurrection from the dead , neither marry nor are given in marriage ; 36 nor can they die anymore , for they are equal to the angels [ isaggelos ] and are sons of God , being sons of the resurrection . "
( NKJV )
The Greek word translated by the phrase " equal to the angels " is isaggelos , which is a combination of isos meaning " equal " or " same " and aggelos or " angel . "
This Scripture is corroborated by Revelation 21:17 , which shows that after the resurrection there will be no difference between men and angels :
REVELATION 21:17
Then he measured its wall : one hundred and forty - four cubits , according to the measure of a man , that is , of an angel .
( NKJV )
The book of Revelation also shows that the loyal angels are the brothers of the saints :
REVELATION 12:10
Then I heard a loud voice saying in heaven , " Now salvation , and strength , and the kingdom of our God , and the power of His Christ have come , for the accuser of our brethren [ adelphon hemon ] , who accused them before our God day and night , has been cast down .
( NKJV )
In Revelation 12:10 , John hears the voice of an angel in heaven proclaiming the coming kingdom of God and the expulsion of Satan and his demons from heaven .
This angel refers to the saints as " our brethren " [ adelphon hemon ] , indicating that the loyal angels and the saints are brothers .
In I Timothy 5:21 , Paul calls the holy angels the " elect angels " :
I TIMOTHY 5:21 I charge you before God and the Lord Jesus Christ and the elect [ eklekton ] angels that you observe these things without prejudice , doing nothing with partiality .
( NKJV )
The word eklekton is a form of the Greek word eklektos , which means " chosen " or " elect . "
The root word eklektos , or a variation of it , is used numerous times in the New Testament to refer to those humans called by God to be part of His family ( Matt .
20:16 ; 22:14 ; 24:22 , 24 , 31 ; Mark 13:20 , 22 , 27 ; Luke 18:7 ; Rom. 8:33 ; 16:13 ; Col. 3:12 ; II Tim .
2:10 ; Tit. 1:1 ; I Pet. 1:2 ; 2:9 ; II John 1 , 13 ; Rev. 17:14 ) .
Paul 's use of the term in I Timothy 5:21 indicates that God also considers as His sons those angels who have remained loyal to Him .
The Scriptures indicate that all who have the Holy Spirit are God 's sons :
ROMANS 8:14
For as many as are led by the Spirit of God , these are sons of God. ( NKJV )
Most scholars use the first two chapters of Hebrews to denigrate the position of the angels and claim that they are not sons of God .
However , the author of Hebrews was simply emphasizing the superiority of the Messiah over the angels .
This preeminence does not mean that the angels are not also God 's sons .
They have a different role in God 's plan than Messiah and humanity , but any interpretation of the book of Hebrews which denies sonship to the angels obviously contradicts the Old Testament references cited above .
(3) One Of God 's Sons Is Yeshua The Messiah
This point is acknowledged by all parties .
In the Gospels , Yeshua generally refers to himself as the " son of man , " and occasionally as the " son of God . "
Nowhere in the New Testament does he claim to be God , even though the Jews sought to kill him because they thought he had made himself equal ( isos ) with God by saying that God was his Father ( John 5:18 ) .
LUKE 1:31 " And behold , you will conceive in your womb and bring forth a Son , and shall call his name Jesus .
32 He will be great , and will be called the Son of the Highest ; and the Lord God will give him the throne of his father David . " . . . 35 And the angel answered and said to her , " The Holy Spirit will come upon you , and the power of the Highest will overshadow you ; therefore , also , that Holy One who is to be born will be called the Son of God . " ( NKJV )
JOHN 6:69 [ Peter said ]
" Also we have come to believe and know that you are the Christ , the Son of the living God . " ( NKJV )
JOHN 11:27 She [ Martha ] said to Him , " Yes , Lord , I believe that you are the Christ , the Son of God , who is to come into the world . " ( NKJV )
LUKE 22:70
Then they all said , " Are you then the Son of God ? "
So he [ Yeshua ] said to them , " You rightly say that I am . " ( NKJV )
JOHN 20:31
But these are written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ , the Son of God , and that believing you may have life in His name .
( NKJV )
JOHN 10:34 Jesus answered them , " Is it not written in your Law , ' I said , " You are gods " ' ?
35 If He called them gods , to whom the word of God came ( and the Scripture can not be broken ) , 36 do you say of him whom the Father sanctified and sent into the world , ' You are blaspheming , ' because I said , ' I am the Son of God ' ? " ( NKJV )
In the preceding passage from John , Yeshua is responding to the Jews ' accusation that he was blaspheming and making himself God.
Yeshua answered their charge by quoting from Psalm 82 , which speaks of the judgment that will come upon the divine council of the " sons of God " ( powerful angelic rulers ) because they have judged unjustly .
In this passage , Yeshua was equating himself to those " sons of God " that ruled in the divine council .
In effect , his defense was " I am ALSO one of those ' sons of God ' . "
It 's interesting to note that the demons ( who would be in a position to know his origin and status ) never refer to Jesus as God , but always call him the " son of God " or the " son of the Most High God " :
MATTHEW 8:29
And suddenly they cried out , saying , " What have we to do with you , Jesus , you Son of God ?
Have you come here to torment us before the time ? " ( NKJV )
MARK 3:11
And the unclean spirits , whenever they saw him [ Yeshua ] , fell down before him and cried out , saying , " You are the Son of God . " ( NKJV )
MARK 5:7
And he cried out with a loud voice and said , " What have I to do with you , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ?
I implore you by God that you do not torment me . " ( NKJV )
LUKE 4:41
And demons also came out of many , crying out and saying , " You are the Christ , the Son of God ! "
And he , rebuking them , did not allow them to speak , for they knew that he was the Christ .
( NKJV )
LUKE 8:28
When he saw Jesus , he cried out , fell down before him , and with a loud voice said , " What have I to do with you , Jesus , Son of the Most High God ?
I beg you , do not torment me ! " ( NKJV )
(4) Only God The Father Has Existed From Eternity
This is a major point in proving that the Messiah is not the one true God.
John 1:1 , where the Word ( Gr. logos ) is called God ( Gr. Theos ) , has been misunderstood and misinterpreted .
Trinitarian theologians have used this verse to elevate the status of Christ due to their belief in his co-eternality and co-equality with the Father .
However , a proper understanding of this Scripture does not support this belief .
JOHN 1:1 In ( the ) beginning was the Word , and the Word was with [ the ] * God , and God was the Word . ( The Interlinear Bible )
* The Greek article ton ( " the " ) is untranslated in this version , as it is in most New Testament translations .
New Testament Greek Syntax ( NTGS ) states that in the Greek language , " the basic function of the article is to stress the identity of a person , a class , or a quality " ( p. 31 ) .
Thus , the presence of the article ton before " God " in John 1:1 stresses the identity of the Father ; He is " the God . "
Here is how this verse is rendered in some other Bible translations :
JOHN 1:1 The Logos existed in the very beginning , the Logos was with God , the Logos was divine .
( Moffatt Translation )
JOHN 1:1
In the beginning the Word existed .
The Word was with God and the Word was divine .
( The Complete Bible - An American Translation )
JOHN 1:1
In [ the ] beginning the Word was , and the word was with God , and the Word was a god .
( New World Translation )
JOHN 1:1 The Word was in the beginning and the Word was with God , and the Word was a god .
( The New Testament , in an Improved Version , upon the Basis of Archbishop Newcome 's New Translation : with a Corrected Text )
John 1:1 makes it clear that both YHVH the Father and the Logos , who became Yeshua the Messiah , were already in existence at " a beginning " ( the definite article " the " is not present in the original Greek ) .
Since eternity has no starting point , the beginning mentioned by John must be a specific point in time .
As such , it does not signify pre-existence from eternity .
Interpreting this Scripture to mean that " ton theon " ( " the God " ) and " ho logos " ( " the Word " ) have eternally co-existed is unjustified .
Most probably the " beginning " was the time spoken of in Genesis 1:1 - the establishment of the physical creation .
This would fit in with all the Scriptures which say that God created the universe through Messiah ( John 1:3 , 10 ; I Cor. 8:6 ; Eph. 3:9 ; Col. 1:16 ; Heb. 1:2 ) .
If this is the " beginning " John speaks of , angels would also have existed at that time ( Job 38:4 - 7 ) .
Nothing in John 1:1 precludes other beings from also having been in existence then .
No one claims that the angels have co-existed eternally with the Father , even though they too were present early on during the physical creation .
The view that the " beginning " is the creation of the physical universe is supported by Yeshua 's statement in John 8:44 , as viewed in the context of Ezekiel 28:15 :
JOHN 8:44 " You are of your father the devil , and the desires of your father you want to do .
He was a murderer from the beginning , and does not stand in the truth , because there is no truth in him .
When he speaks a lie , he speaks from his own resources , for he is a liar and the father of it . " ( NKJV )
EZEKIEL 28:15
You [ Satan ] were perfect in your ways from the day you were created , till iniquity was found in you .
( NKJV )
Yeshua said that Satan had been a murderer from " the beginning , " yet Ezekiel was inspired to write that Satan had been perfect in his ways from the time he was created until iniquity was found in him .
The " beginning " spoken of by Messiah in John 8:44 was clearly sometime after Satan 's creation .
Yeshua 's statement obviously does not mean that Satan has " eternally co-existed " with God ; therefore , the phrase the " beginning " cannot be taken to signify eternal existence , which only God has .
It is a fact that John 1:1 says that the Word was God ( or " a God " ) .
However , Messiah showed that the Scriptures also refer to angelic beings as " gods . "
In John 10:34 - 36 , Yeshua answers some Jews who wanted to stone him because they felt he was blaspheming by claiming to be the Son of God :
JOHN 10:34 Jesus answered them , " Is it not written in your Law , ' I said , " You are gods " [ Psa. 82:6 ] '?
35 If it calls them gods [ theous ] to whom the word of God came , and Scripture cannot be set aside , 36 can you say that the one whom the Father has consecrated and sent into the world blasphemes because I said , ' I am the Son of God ' ? " ( NAB )
According to The NKJV Greek English Interlinear New Testament , the word " gods " which Yeshua used in John 10:35 to refer to the angelic " sons of God " is the Greek theous , a plural form of the same word used in John 1:1 to describe the Word .
As previously discussed , Yeshua here is associating himself with the " sons of God " that govern the world as part of the divine council .
But that obviously does not mean these angelic rulers have existed for eternity with God.
Likewise , John 1:1 should not be taken to mean that Yeshua the Messiah has eternally co-existed with the Father , who is greater than all ( John 10:29 ) .
Too many Scriptures show otherwise .
I Timothy 6:13 - 16 also shows that Messiah is not co-equal or co-eternal with the Father .
In this Scripture , Paul clearly distinguishes between the two entities he is writing about : God and Yeshua the Messiah .
Paul says that God alone is immortal , and that He has never been seen by man :
I TIMOTHY 6:13 Now , before God the source of all life and before Jesus Christ , who spoke up as a witness for the truth in front of Pontius Pilate , I put you to the duty 14 of doing all that you have been told , with no faults or failures , until the Appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ , 15 who at the due time will be revealed by God , the blessed and only Ruler of all , the King of kings and the Lord of lords , 16 who alone is immortal , whose home is in inaccessible light , whom no man has seen and no man is able to see : to him be honor and everlasting power .
Amen . ( Jerusalem Bible )
In this passage of Scripture , God is clearly differentiated from Yeshua the Messiah .
The Messiah will be revealed when God the Father commands his return to earth ( Mark 13:32 ) , since only the Father knows when that will occur .
Christ was seen in the Old Testament as the " Angel of YHVH " and in the New Testament both as a man and in a glorified state after his resurrection .
It is stated throughout the New Testament that no one has seen God ( John 1:18 ; 5:37 ; 6:46 ; I Tim. 6:16 ; I John 4:12 ) .
Obviously Paul is referring to God the Father as the One " who alone is immortal . "
If God the Father is the only immortal entity , then there was a point when no other beings existed .
Therefore , this Scripture leads us to the logical conclusion that , at some point , Messiah did not exist .
Revelation 4:8-10 also shows the immortal status of the Most High God :
REVELATION 4:8 " . . .
Lord God Almighty , who was and is and is to come ! "
9
Whenever the living creatures give glory and honor and thanks to Him who sits on the throne , who lives forever and ever , 10 the twenty - four elders fall down before Him who sits on the throne and worship
Him who lives forever and ever . . . ( NKJV )
(5) God The Father Is The Creator And Source Of All Life
The Bible is specific in saying that the Most High God is the giver of all life and that He created all that exists .
I Timothy 6:13 identifies two entities : God and Yeshua the Messiah .
Paul says that God ( not Messiah ) is the source of all life , although other Scriptures show conclusively that God created all things through Messiah ( see point 7 below ) .
I TIMOTHY 6:13 I urge you in the sight of God who gives life to all things , and before Christ Jesus who witnessed the good confession before Pontius Pilate , ( NKJV )
Revelation 4 pictures the heavenly throne room , the seat of God 's universe - ruling government .
The Father is shown sitting on His throne , with the angelic council of twenty - four elders seated around Him ( see Psa. 29:1 - 2 ; 89:5 - 6 above ) .
During John 's vision , he sees the elders praise God :
REVELATION 4:11
" You are worthy , O Lord , to receive glory and honor and power ; for You created all things [ panta ] , and by Your will they exist and were created . " ( NKJV )
The angelic elders give God the Father praise because
He created " all things " ( panta , a plural form of the adjective pas , " all " ) .
Nothing is excluded .
This is a theme that runs throughout the entirety of the Bible .
ACTS 17:24 " God , who made the world and everything in it , since He is Lord of heaven and earth , does not dwell in temples made with hands .
25 Nor is
He worshiped with men's hands , as though He needed anything , since
He gives to all life , breath , and all things . "
( NKJV )
MARK 13:19
" For in those days there will be tribulation , such as has not been since the beginning of the creation which God created until this time , nor ever shall be . " ( NKJV )
REVELATION 10:5
The angel whom I saw standing on the sea and on the land raised up his hand to heaven 6 and swore by Him who lives forever and ever , who created heaven and the things that are in it , the earth and the things that are in it , and the sea and the things that are in it . . . " ( NKJV )
(6) The First Thing Created By God Was The Messiah
This is the most controversial point .
The following Scriptures ( A - E ) used to support this assertion are examined in depth .
( A) REVELATION 3:14 [ Messiah said ]
" And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write : ' The words of the Amen , the faithful and true witness , the beginning [ arche ] of God 's creation . ' " ( ESV )
The Greek word translated " beginning " in Revelation 3:14 is arche .
Regarding this word , Vine 's says arche " means 'a beginning . '
The root arch primarily indicated what was of worth .
Hence the verb archõ meant ' to be first , ' and archõn denoted a ' ruler ' " ( NT , p. 58 ) .
A Greek - English Lexicon of the New Testament and Other Early Christian Literature ( BAGD ) defines arche in Revelation 3:14 as " the first cause . "
Not coincidentally , this is the only place in the Bible where it is assigned this meaning .
However , the author admits that the meaning " beginning =first created is linguistically possible " ( p. 112 , emphasis mine ) .
The Exegetical Dictionary of the New Testament ( EDNT ) states that arche " always signifies ' primacy ' . . . whether a ) of time : beginning ( origin ) , b ) of place : point of origin or departure , or c ) of rank : power , dominion , kingdom , office " ( vol. 1 , p. 161 ) .
In the booklet The God You Can Know ! , Raymond F. McNair of the Global Church of God writes of this verse :
Some teach that Christ is a " created " Being -- that He was the " first of the creation of God . "
But the Bible does not teach that !
The King James Version of the Bible might lead some to believe that Christ was created by the Father , but other translations more correctly render the meaning of Revelation 3:14 .
The proper rendering of this verse shows that Christ is " the Beginner [ Originator ] of the creation of God . "
Christ was not the " beginning " of God 's creation but was it 's " Beginner " or " Originator . "
Notice how this is rendered in the following translations : Christ is " . . . the ORIGIN of God 's creation " ( Moffatt ) ; He is " . . . the RULER of God 's creation " ( NIV ) ( p. 4 ) .
The word arche , or a form of it , appears in the Textus Receptus ( the manuscript base from which the KJV and NKJV were translated ) 58 times in 56 verses .
Of those times , it is translated " beginning " 40 times in the NKJV ; conversely , it appears as " beginner " 0 times , " originator " 0 times , " origin " 0 times , and " ruler " 0 times ( although the plural form archais is translated " rulers " once ) .
The biblical usage of the word obviously contradicts what Mr. McNair claims .
Additionally , the King James Version is not the only translation which renders the last part of Revelation 3:14 as " the beginning of the creation of God . "
Other Bible versions which translate arche as " beginning " in Revelation 3:14 include the New King James Version , the New American Standard Bible , the Revised Standard Version , the Darby Translation , the Phillips Translation , the Webster Translation , the New World Translation , the English Standard Version , The NKJV Greek English Interlinear New Testament , and others .
Even with the Trinitarian bias of the vast majority of New Testament translations , this word is translated " beginning " in several of the major translations currently available .
The other uses of arche in the book of Revelation also help determine its correct translation in Revelation 3:14 .
In the Textus Receptus , the exact same form of arche is used four times in Revelation ( Rev. 1:8 , 3:14 , 21:6 , 22:13 ) .
Each of the other three occurrences are rendered " beginning . "
Therefore , translating arche as " beginning " in 3:14 is consistent with the way John uses the term in the rest of the book .
The meaning of arche is generally acknowledged by scholars , which is why some translators render it " beginning " even though they disagree with what the verse seems to say with arche rendered that way .
Taken literally , Messiah confirms in Revelation 3:14 what Paul wrote of him in Colossians 1:15 ( examined next ) .
It is up to you to believe either the Word of God or the ideas and human reasoning of men .
( B) COLOSSIANS 1:15 [ Messiah ] who is the image of the invisible God , the firstborn [ prototokos ] of every [ pases ] creature [ ktiseos ] : ( KJV )
To understand what Paul is attempting to say in this verse , we will take an in - depth look at the Greek words prototokos pases ktiseos , which make up the phrase " firstborn of every creature . "
Vine 's says that prototokos is a compound of " protos , ' first , ' and tikto , ' to beget ' . . . " ( NT , p. 240 ) .
In addition to Colossians 1:15 , this word ( or a variation of it ) is found eight other times in the New Testament .
Matthew 1:25 and Luke 2:7 use it to describe Yeshua as the " firstborn " son of Mary .
In Romans 8:29 it denotes Christ as the " firstborn " among many brethren .
Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the " firstborn " of every creature .
Colossians 1:18 and Revelation 1:5 both state that Christ , as the first human to be resurrected to spirit life , was the " firstborn " from the dead .
Hebrews 1:6 speaks of Christ 's return into the world as the " firstborn . "
Hebrews 11:28 and 12:23 use plural forms of the word ; 11:28 refers to the " firstborn " of the Egyptians who were slain by the death angel at the first Passover , while 12:23 speaks of the church of the " firstborn " whose names are written in heaven .
In summary , the term prototokos is translated " firstborn " in each biblical usage of the word .
Regarding Colossians 1:15 , Word Meanings in the New Testament remarks :
To say that Christ is " the firstborn of all creation " certainly poses a problem .
Ever since the days of Arianism in the Early Church , those who deny the deity of Jesus have seized on this verse as proof that He was a created being even though the first one created by God ( p. 349 ) .
Because of the Trinity doctrine , which proclaims the co-equality and co-eternality of Messiah with the Father , the meaning of this verse has of necessity been distorted .
It " poses a problem " because a literal understanding of Colossians 1:15 discredits the Trinitarian theology .
Accordingly , you have scholars making such unsupported comments as the following :
Prototokos . . . is used of Christ as born of the Virgin Mary , Luke 2:7 ; further , in His relationship to the Father , expressing His priority to , and preeminence over , creation , not in the sense of being the " first " to be born . . . ( Vine 's , NT , p. 240 ) The expression " firstborn of all creation " ( prototokos pases ktiseos , Col 1:15 ) occurs in the opening line of the Colossian " hymn " . . . and speaks of Christ 's relationship to the creation .
Stripped from its context and from other Pauline statements about Christ , this phrase might be understood to include him among created things ( as simply the " eldest " of the " family " : prototokos in Rom 8:29 has this inclusive sense ) .
The English word firstborn is misleading for it normally suggests someone who is born and therefore created .
But this cannot be the significance of the term here . . . ( Dictionary of Paul and His Letters , " Firstborn , " p. 302 )
The reason firstborn " cannot be the significance of the term " prototokos in Colossians 1:15 is because a literal understanding of the word would invalidate the Trinity doctrine .
Therefore , mainstream theologians have been forced to interpret it figuratively based on their Trinitarian bias , even though an examination of the word as it is used elsewhere in the New Testament appears to indicate a literal meaning .
Pases is a form of the Greek adjective pas .
Vine 's says the word " radically means ' all . '
Used without the article [ as it is in Col. 1:15 ] it means ' every , ' every kind or variety " ( NT , p. 21 ) .
Ktiseos is a form of the noun ktisis .
Vine 's says that " like the English word ' creation , ' it also signifies the product of the ' creative ' act , the ' creature , ' as in . . . Col. 1:15 " ( NT , p. 137 ) .
NAGL says that in Colossians 1:15 , ktiseos means " a created thing , a creature " ( p. 250 ) .
Given the information above , the KJV rendering of Colossians 1:15 appears to be the most accurate translation of the original Greek .
If you accept that the Bible means what it says , then Colossians 1:15 clearly states that Messiah was the " firstborn of every creature . "
He was the first being that God created .
This fully supports what Messiah himself states in Revelation 3:14 .
Afterward the Father produced the rest of the creation through him and for him ( Col. 1:16 ) , because God 's plan of salvation for mankind and Messiah 's primary role in it were formulated before the physical creation ( I Pet .
1:19 - 20 , Tit. 1:2 , II Tim .
1:9 , Eph. 1:4-5 , I Cor. 2:7 , Rev. 13:8 ) .
( C) HEBREWS 3:1 . . .
Christ Jesus 2 being faithful to the One having made [ poiesanti ] him as also Moses was in His whole house .
( The NKJV Greek English Interlinear New Testament )
The Greek word translated " having made " in verse 2 is poiesanti .
This participle is a form of the Greek word poieo , which according to Vine 's means " to do " or " to make . '
It " is used in the latter sense ( a ) of constructing or producing anything , of the creative acts of God " ( NT , p. 386 ) .
BAGD says this word is used " of God 's creative activity " to mean " make , manufacture , produce [ ti ] something . "
Regarding Hebrews 3:2 , BAGD says poiesanti is used " of the relation of Jesus to God " ( p. 680 ) .
The KJV and NKJV , as well as most other translations , render poiesanti in Hebrews 3:2 as " appointed . "
But is that a legitimate translation ?
In the Textus Receptus New Testament , poieo and its variations appear 581 times in 521 verses .
Of those occurrences , they are translated " appointed " just once , here in Hebrews 3:2 .
The words " appoint " or " appointed " appear 27 times in the KJV ; this is the only place that poiesanti or any of the variants of poieo are the underlying Greek word .
Let 's look at an occurrence of the specific form poiesanti in Revelation 14 :
REVELATION 14:7
Saying with a loud voice , " Fear God and give glory to Him , for the hour of His judgment has come ; and worship Him who made [ poiesanti ] heaven and earth , the sea and springs of water . "
( NKJV )
Based on the definition of this word , as well as its biblical usage elsewhere , it 's obvious that poiesanti should be translated " who made " in Hebrews 3:2 , not " who appointed . "
Just as Moses was faithful , Messiah also was faithful to God the Father , who made ( " created " ) him .
(D) JOHN 5:26 " For just as the Father has life in Himself , even so He gave [ edoke ] to the Son also to have life in himself ; " ( NASU )
A close examination of this verse will show that Messiah has not eternally co-existed with the Father .
Let 's focus on the Greek verb edoke , translated as " He gave " in John 5:26 above .
The Greek word edoke is a form of the finite verb didomi , which means " to give . "
According to NAGL , the elements of this word are " third person , singular , aorist , active , indicative " ( p. 116 ) .
NTGS says that , " verbs are divided into three groups : finite , infinitive , and participle .
Finite verbs have five elements : person ( first , second , third ) , number ( singular and plural ) , mood ( indicative , subjunctive , imperative , and optative ) , tense ( present , future , imperfect , aorist , perfect , and pluperfect ) , and voice ( active , middle , and passive ) " ( p. 261 ) .
We 'll look at each of these elements in edoke to determine its precise meaning .
First , the word is third person and singular , which refers to the one person being talked about , in this case God the Father .
The word is in the aorist tense , which NTGS says " usually refers to past - time action as an event regardless of how long the event was in progress " ( p. 303 ) .
Next is the voice .
In the active voice , the subject ( the Father ) names the one being acted on ( the Son ) .
Mood indicates the speaker 's attitude toward what he is saying .
NTGS says that " the indicative mood is generally considered the mood of fact , reality , or certainty " ( p. 261 ) .
So if we take the literal meaning of edoke here , Messiah is saying that it is a fact ( indicative mood ) that God the Father ( third person , singular , active voice - giver ) at some past time gave ( aorist tense ) , Messiah ( active voice - receiver ) life , which only the Father had inherent within Himself .
The fact that Messiah said YHVH the Father gave him life requires us to infer that Messiah did not have life before it was given to him by the Father .
Any other interpretation of this verse specifically contradicts the proper usage of the Greek verb edoke and generally denies the function of language as a vehicle for conveying information .
Therefore , this verse refutes the claim that Christ has co-existed with the Father for all eternity !
(E) PROVERBS 8:22 " The LORD created [ qanani ] me at the beginning of His work , the first of His acts of old .
23 Ages ago I was set up , at the first , before the beginning of the earth .
24 When there were no depths I was brought forth [ cholaleti ] , when there were no springs abounding with water .
25 Before the mountains had been shaped , before the hills , I was brought forth [ cholaleti ] ; 26 before
He had made the earth with its fields , or the first of the dust of the world .
( RSV )
This passage of Scripture comes from Proverbs 8 , the " wisdom chapter . "
Harper 's Bible Commentary ( Harper's ) says of the eighth chapter of Proverbs that " the translation and interpretation of no passage in Proverbs is more hotly contested than this one , no doubt because Woman Wisdom 's claims are so difficult to assimilate within later Judaism and Christianity .
. . .
The view of wisdom found here becomes important for the logos theology in the prologue of the Gospel of John . . . " ( p. 507 ) .
In verse 22 above , the Hebrew verb and its object qanani are translated " created me , " following the example of the Aramaic , Syriac , and Greek versions of the Old Testament .
According to Harper's , the KJV and NKJV follow " the more literalistic ancient authorities : Aquila , Symmachus , Theodotian , and Jerome " ( p. 507 ) by translating this " possessed . "
Vine 's says that although the primary meaning of the Hebrew root word qanah is " ' to get , acquire , earn ' . . . certain poetic passages have long suggested that this verb means ' create . '
In Gen. 14:19 , Melchizedek blessed Abram and said : ' Blessed be Abram by God Most High , maker [ KJV , " possessor " ] of heaven and earth ' ( RSV ) .
Gen. 14:22 repeats this divine epithet .
Deut .
32:6 makes this meaning certain in that qanah is parallel to ' asah , ' to make ' : ' Is he not your father , who created ( qanah ) you , who made ( ' asah ) you and established ( kun ) you ? ' ( RSV ) .
Ps. 78:54 ; 139:13 ; and Prov. 8:22 - 23 also suggest the idea of creation " ( OT , p. 52 ) .
Harper 's says that " it should be noted that the Hebrew verb cholaleti , here translated ' brought forth ' ( vv. 24 -25 ) , derives from the root chyl , which is generally associated with the physical activity of the female in giving birth .
Hence , one must ask if Yahweh , in the manner of a female , gives birth ( metaphorically ? ) to Woman Wisdom ? " ( p. 507 ) .
No , it 's not " Woman Wisdom " to whom God gave birth or brought forth , but rather the being known as the Logos , Yeshua the Messiah .
In this passage of Scripture , wisdom is symbolic of Messiah .
Indeed , Paul calls Christ " the wisdom of God " in I Corinthians 1 :
I CORINTHIANS 1:24
But to those who are called , both Jews and Greeks , Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God. ( NKJV )
(7) After Creating Messiah , God Then Created The Rest Of The Universe Through Him
Continuing with Proverbs 8 , we see that " Wisdom " ( Messiah ) was with God as a " master workman " ( " master craftsman " - NKJV ) while He created the universe .
PROVERBS 8:27
When
He established the heavens , I was there , when He drew a circle on the face of the deep , 28 when He made firm the skies above , when He established the fountains of the deep , 29 when He assigned to the sea its limit , so that the waters might not transgress
His command , when He marked out the foundations of the earth , 30 then I was beside Him , like a master workman ; and I was daily His delight , rejoicing before Him always , 31 rejoicing in His inhabited world , and delighting in the sons of men . " ( RSV )
This fits in superbly with the remaining Scriptures which show that although God the Father created the universe , He did so through Messiah :
JOHN 1:3
All things were made through him [ Messiah ] , and without him nothing was made that was made .
( NKJV )
JOHN 1:10 He [ Messiah ] was in the world , and the world was made through him , and the world did not know him .
( NKJV )
I CORINTHIANS 8:6
Yet for us there is one God , the Father , of whom are all things , and we for Him ; and one Lord Jesus Christ , through whom are all things , and through whom we live .
( NKJV )
EPHESIANS 3:9
And to make all see what is the fellowship of the mystery , which from the beginning of the ages has been hidden in God who created all things through Jesus Christ ; ( NKJV )
COLOSSIANS 1:15 He [ Messiah ] is the image of the invisible God , the first - born of all creation ; 16 for in him all things were created , in heaven and on earth , visible and invisible , whether thrones or dominions or principalities or authorities - all things were created through him and for him .
17 He is before all things , and in him all things hold together .
( RSV )
HEBREWS 1:1 God , who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets , 2 has in these last days spoken to us by His Son , whom He has appointed heir of all things , through whom also
He made the worlds ; ( NKJV )
CONCLUSION
The Bible conclusively shows that YHVH the Father is the only true God .
He alone has immortality , since only He has existed from eternity .
God has numerous sons , all of them a product of His will .
These sons include the loyal angelic host as well as those humans called and given the Holy Spirit .
The Father is the source of all life , and Messiah was the first being created .
God then established the rest of the creation through him and for him .

Microsoft is apparently teaching Best Buy employees that Windows 7 beats Linux in every category imaginable .
Redmond is n't just saying that Windows has more software or games available than Linux does or that Windows has compatibility with more devices and hardware than Linux does .
The software giant is actually going as far as teaching employees that there are certain statements about Linux that need to be labeled as myths .
An employee of Best Buy and a member of the Overclock .
net forums recently uploaded slides from a Microsoft presentation titled " Linux Compare " that gives various reasons for using Windows 7 over Linux .
The images are no longer available on the forum , but thanks to the beauty of cache , we 've saved 11 of the screenshots and embedded them below :
Microsoft has already said that all editions of Windows 7 will work fine on netbooks , but now it wants to make sure that consumers believe they all beat Linux on a netbook .
At this point , everything looks fine .
Microsoft is simply going to explain the pros of running Windows over Linux .
By slide three , it gets ugly .
Microsoft makes sure that Windows 7 appears to be superior in every way .
Here Microsoft is simply helping Best Buy employees remember what to list when explaining to a customer why Windows 7 is superior .
This slide is n't too bad , though WINE is conveniently left out .
No mention of Linux ; again , not too bad .
Here Microsoft is simply talking up the good points of Windows 7 .
Linux does n't offer free downloads ?
The actual operating system is a free download !
This is where Microsoft should have stopped .
Linux does indeed offer a ton of updates , and they 're easy to download and install .
This is probably the most controversial part of all the slides .
Microsoft has somehow managed to imply , without actually saying it , that Windows 7 is more secure than Linux .
This Microsoft training material for Best Buy retail staff is deliberately attacking Linux .
While there are correct assertions in the slides , the majority of the statements are inaccurate , or are only accurate in the specific way they are worded .
Blizzard might not support World of Warcraft on Linux but WINE solves that problem well .
Calling Linux 's safety reputation a myth , that Linux updates and upgrades are difficult and time consuming , is quite ridiculous .
The mention that Windows Live Essentials is not available for Linux is of course correct , but it 's not as if Linux does n't have many free alternatives to the software suite .
The general tone of the slides is very propagandist and is full of deliberate skewing .
The fact that Microsoft finds this type of " training material " necessary is just shameful .

The beautiful and the dammed
THE Arctic tundra is one of the world 's most extensive ecosystems , and the frozen soil known as permafrost , which underlies it , can be hundreds of metres deep .
But as the world warms up in response to the millions of tonnes of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases being poured into the atmosphere each year , so does the permafrost .
As the permafrost thaws , bacteria start chewing up the organic matter it contains .
This releases yet more carbon dioxide , as well as methane , another greenhouse gas , which has 25 times the warming potential of CO 2 .
Edward Schuur of the University of Florida in Gainesville , a doyen of the field , estimates that the world 's permafrost contains twice as much carbon as its atmosphere .
If even a fraction of that were released as CO 2 and methane , it would be bad news .
Nor is that all .
Thawing permafrost also leaks nitrates and phosphates into the tundra , allowing novel plant species to get a foothold in what was , to start with , a fairly spartan habitat .
It distorts the Earth 's surface , too , creating a landscape of domes and pits known as thermokarst because of its resemblance to the karstic terrain of limestone - rich parts of the world .
This changes the tundra 's ecology .
It also plays havoc with human structures , such as buildings , roads and pipelines , that sit on top of it .
For all of these reasons , then , more research is needed into this icy realm .
And that is the object of a project with the unsnappy name of Spatial and Temporal Influences of Thermokarst Failures on Surface Processes in Arctic Landscapes , which was kicked off by a group of scientists who gathered in late June at the Toolik Field Station in northern Alaska .
Karsting the first stone
The project , which is led by Breck Bowden of the University of Vermont in Burlington , involves 17 research groups from America and Canada .
To start with , they will use a combination of aerial photography , field measurements , and ground - and satellite - based sensors to compile a map of all the thermokarstic areas of Alaska .
This will provide a reference point from which changes can be measured .
The team will then try to work out how the development of features such as “ retrogressive thaw slumps ” and “ active - layer detachments ” ( different ways in which thawing permafrost can cause a hillside to slip ) are associated with the local climate , geology and vegetation .
They will look , too , at the amount of ice in the ground , and the temperature and the moisture of the soil .
All these data will be fed into computer models which , the researchers hope , will allow them to develop an automated way of predicting where and when new features will form , and to monitor them when they appear .
Dr Bowden and his colleagues also hope to understand the impact of thermokarst activity on the structure of the soil , and its nutrient content .
They will concentrate on a few sites that can be studied intensively and which are affected by different types of activity .
They will measure the amount of carbon , phosphate and nitrate in the soil , together with the rate of plant growth and microbial decomposition .
That will let them work out just how “ leaky ” thawing permafrost is and thus how big its contribution of greenhouse gases to the atmosphere might be , should the worst come to the worst .
It will also help them forecast changes in the tundra 's vegetation .
The softening of the soil and the consequent release of nutrients is likely to encourage the growth of shrubs on land that is now dominated by grass , moss and lichens .
The researchers will monitor the growth of this vegetation around newly formed thermokarst features and use experimental field plots to test how conditions mimicking such features affect which species will thrive .
Last , the project will try to work out how thawing permafrost will affect the numerous streams , rivers and lakes of the Arctic .
Together , these amount to the biggest acreage of water on “ dry ” land .
As water moves through affected areas , it picks up both nutrients and sediment that would otherwise be held in the permafrost 's icy grasp .
These , paradoxically , have opposite effects on the growth of algae .
The phosphates and nitrates stimulate it whereas the extra sediment suppresses it by trapping nutrients in the beds of such bodies of water .
Muddy waters
It is not only natural habitats and future generations that are threatened by the thawing of the permafrost .
People in the here and now are affected , as well .
Sediments from a huge thermokarstic area have , for example , dammed the Selawik River in north - western Alaska , interfering with fish and threatening the livelihood of nearby villages .
Elsewhere in the state , a combination of melting sea ice and thawing permafrost has exacerbated the erosion of several coastal villages , which will have to be relocated at a considerable cost .
Whether anything short of reversing climate change can be done about all this is a moot question .
But at least when the project reports , in five years ' time , the size of the threat will be clearer .
The news it brings may not be welcome .
But it is surely better than living in ignorance about one of the world 's most important habitats .
The typical 50 - year - old has only 1,990 calories each day , does at least four forms of exercise and treats themselves to just one piece of junk food each week
Researchers found the average 25 - year - old consumes over 2,300 calories a day , exercises only three times a week and munches on 12 types of junk food a month .
But the typical 50 - year - old has only 1,990 calories each day , does at least four forms of exercise and treats themselves to just one piece of junk food each week .
And while those in their mid-20s have three takeaways a month , the older generation have only one .
The study , commissioned by global nutrition and direct selling company Herbalife , quizzed 4,000 Brits on their diet and lifestyle .
Neil Spiers , Herbalife ’s Regional Vice President , said : “ The results of the study will be surprising to most as it ’s natural to think that the younger you are , the fitter you are .
“ It seems many young people are making the mistake of underestimating the benefit of a more balanced , holistic approach to diet and lifestyle .
“ It ’s great to think that the older generation are showing the youngsters the way when it comes to healthier living . ”
The nationwide research of 16 - 80 year olds quizzed them on their health and exercise habits .
Click Here !
It found the over - 50s are more likely to walk as much as they can during the day – to the shops or with the dog – while those in their 20s tend to drive everywhere .
But when it comes to excuses for not exercising , over a third ( 36 per cent ) of 25 year olds blame not having enough time , compared to 22 per cent of over - 50s .
The research found 70 per cent of Brits see themselves as healthy – exercising for 27 minutes a day , at least three times a week , opting to go for a walk , run , cycle or gym .
A quarter of Brits polled cycle to see friends or go to the shops , and 70 per cent take the stairs instead of the lift .
Nearly four in 10 walk to the train station or to work in a bid to keep fit .
The study also found the average Brit believes they are overweight by nine pounds .
Over a quarter of the population are currently on a diet – with the ‘ low fat ’ ( 30 per cent ) , ‘ low carb ’ ( 14 per cent ) and ‘ detox ’ ( eight per cent ) diets being the most popular .
And they would wish to lose 13 pounds for them to be their ideal weight .
The study also highlighted the lengths people will go to in order to hide their flab .
Nearly a quarter have fibbed about the amount they eat , one in five has lied about their weight and 12 per cent have cut labels out of clothing which revealed their real size .
A cheeky 16 per cent have turned to slimming aids without telling anyone and seven per cent have uploaded misleading pictures on Facebook .
And 30 per cent have ‘ binge dieted ’ to fit into a dress or to look good in a bikini in time for a holiday .

Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu expects the Swedish government to explicitly denounce a Swedish newspaper report claiming that Israel Defense Forces harvested Palestinians ' organs for transplant and " its anti-Semitic essence " .
The Swedish foreign minister condemned the report in his personal blog , and Netanyahu views this as " a step in the right direction " , but says it is insufficient as long as the government in Stockholm fails to issue an official statement on the matter .
Criticism Israel : Sweden using ' freedom of speech ' as fig leaf Roni Sofer Responding to Swedish prime minister 's refusal to apologize for article alleging Israeli soldiers harvested organs from Palestinian bodies , Foreign Ministry says Sweden utilizing ' freedom of speech ' as excuse not to condemn anti-Semitism Israel : Sweden using ' freedom of speech ' as fig leaf
The Swedish government has so far refrained from denouncing the newspaper wholeheartedly , leaning on the principle of freedom of press .
Finance Minister Yuval Steinitz said Sunday morning , " We are in a crisis until the Swedish government issues a different response .
" The State of Israel , the Jewish people 's state , cannot ignore expressions of anti-Semitism , even if they are made in a respectable newspaper .
Those refusing to renounce such blood libels may become unwanted in the State of Israel , " he said .
Social Affairs Minister Isaac
Herzog noted that this was not a one - time incident , " but a media campaign which has been going on for years . "
Meanwhile , revenge is already seen on the ground .
The Government Press Office ( GPO )
On Sunday morning prevented a reporter and photographer for the Swedish paper Aftonbladet , which published the controversial report , from entering Gaza .
The two were told by the GPO that they would have to wait three months for a pass .
The Foreign Ministry declared last week that it would not grant the newspaper reporters entrance permits until the dispute is resolved .
Daniel Seaman , head of the GPO , said cynically that " we may have to examine their blood type to check if they are eligible for organ donation . "
The article which sparked a row ( from Aftonbladet 's website )
" Those two have fallen into our hands like ripe fruit , " Seaman told Ynet .
" Their newspaper did something that must not be done .
We may have made some harsh comments towards them , but this is required on the backdrop of the newspaper 's attitude towards Israel .
" Over the past few months , many pro-Palestinian activists have been trying to enter Israel , presenting letters from newspaper editorial boards in Sweden .
Our job is to check this , and all the more so when we are dealing with a newspaper that published such a blood libel . "
Last week , Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman compared the Swedish government 's faint response to the newspaper report to " its silence during the Holocaust " .
Swedish Foreign Minister Carl Bildt spoke over the weekend with Netanyahu 's national security advisor , Uzi Arad , seeking to ease the tensions ahead of his planned visit to Israel next month .
Jerusalem is now waiting to see whether the Swedish foreign minister 's tone during the telephone conversation signals a new direction in Stockholm 's policy , which would allow ending the affair .

There is no guarantee that President Obama will be able to avoid critics of his health care proposal when he hosts a town - hall meeting in Belgrade , Mont. , Friday .
Local officials in Belgrade and neighboring Bozeman personally oversaw the handing out of passes Thursday in much the same fashion that a venue would dole out tickets to a rock concert .
Hundreds of people seeking to attend the president ’s event began lining up Wednesday afternoon , and camped out overnight in the parking lots of the two local municipal buildings .
Karen Semerau , the Bozeman official who helped oversee the distribution , said some people brought their dogs , others put up tents , and but for a brief rain shower , those in line appeared to be upbeat about the chance to hear from , and question , the president about his plan .
“ I could n’t tell by looking at people if they were for the president ’s plan or against it , ” Ms. Semerau said .
“ But I can say that the group was totally mixed - college kids , older folks , all walks of life . ”
The White House has reacted strongly to questioning about whether the administration took steps to rig the audience at his last town hall , in Portsmouth , N.H. , after those denied tickets complained that the audience seemed unusually friendly to his point of view .
Press secretary Robert Gibbs said repeatedly that the administration made no effort to exclude the sorts of vocal opponents who have inflamed congressional town - hall events elsewhere in the country .
There is no evidence that the White House did anything to screen the crowd .
But many of the protesters outside the New Hampshire event said they found it disturbing that , even when the president explicitly sought out skeptics in the audience , the majority of questions thrown his way were softballs .
Mr. Gibbs said he believes the media have been disappointed that there were no fireworks at the president ’s town hall .
He also made clear that , while the president does not welcome the sort of belligerent hecklers that have surfaced at numerous congressional town halls , he is holding his events to address what he says is misinformation that he thinks is fanning much of the opposition .
“ I do think that people have questions , ” Mr. Gibbs said Thursday .
“ I think that ’s why - I mean , the president is n’t out doing town - hall meetings just for his health .
I mean , he wants to - I think he understands the need to address concerns or misconceptions out there . ”
Both the White House and a number of labor and advocacy groups have been ramping up campaigns to correct those misconceptions , including a Web site and a chain e-mail written by the president ’s top political adviser , David Axelrod , which began circulating this week .
Marilyn Foltz , a city official in Belgrade , said she believes the Montana residents who waited overnight for tickets in queues that she said snaked like the lines at Disneyworld , “ just want to hear what the president had to say . ”
“ There was no effort , ” Ms. Foltz said , to skew the audience for the president ’s benefit .
“ It was very truly first - come , first - served .
The tickets were dispensed until they were gone . ”

The cardiologist was able to see me and suggested a nuclear stress test which would give a clear picture of the heart and any blockages .
He suggested that my symptoms and family history were significant enough to warrant that test .
My grandfather was dead at 50 of a heart attack , his son dead at 43 of a heart attack and his grandson also dead at 43 of a heart attack .
That history coupled with my recent poor breathing was alarming enough to demand the test .
Today they called and cancelled the test .
It seems my carrier Aetna does not believe I need the test and have denied the claim .
I was told by the doctor 's office that since I had not had any heart events that they would not cover this .
In essence I had not had a heart attack yet so this test was not necessary .
This is the health care system in America today and yet we have these town hall morons screaming about rationing of health care .
What the hell do you call what they just did to me ?
Does anyone think the government would have denied this test ?
My grandmother had a saying " An empty can makes the loudest noise " and seeing these uninformed town hall morons killing our nations first real chance at reform is infuriating .
It seems loud and stupid wins over reason and the insurance companies laugh all the way to the bank while people like me wait to have a heart event so that I can get the needed tests , that is if I live after the event .
I know this is a short diary but my experience is the same as millions of Americans at the mercy of profit driven insurance companies .
It is stories like mine that need to be told .
Now I will walk around not really knowing if I am OK and my first indication that I am not could very well be my last but hey some pig at Aetna just received a bonus to deny me care .
UPDATE : Wow on the recommended list .
I never expected that .
Thanks for all the well wishes .
I will fight them tooth and nail .
So much for the government getting in between you and your doctor .
It is so much better for it to be someone whose salary depends on denying care .
UPDATE 2 : I was denied because although I am having symptoms and have a horrible family history I am not overweight , do n't smoke and do n't have high cholesterol .
So I guess my shortness of breath after very little exertion is just normal aging and not a symptom of a larger problem .
Wow I feel so much better now .
UPDATE 3 : The insurance company has agreed to a regular stress test after multiple calls from myself and my doctor .
I feel relieved although I was more angry than frightened .
On my way home from work I stopped to play the NY Lottery which is up to 150 million and on the way there I spotted a sick kitten on the sidewalk .
It was well past regular vet hours but I found a place to take the animal .
He / She is being treated right now .
This kitten was covered with maggots and so weak it could barely stay up .
It is being treated for free by a wonderful state of the art veterinary center here in Yonkers , NY .
Imagine that free care when you are sick .
The most important thing to this vet was getting the animal well .
Imagine an America where health care was a right .
Today I learned an important lesson .
Even my supposed excellent insurance is not what I thought it was .
This should be a lesson to all those who are not concerned about the health care debate because they are insured .
Go ahead and try to use the coverage and really see what it is worth .
Why the Present Depression Will Be Deeper than the Great Crash of 1929 ( June 4 , 2009 )
Galbraith 's conclusions about the causes of the Great Depression point to why the current Depression will be deeper .
Continuing our analysis of The Great Crash of 1929 by John Kenneth Galbraith : by understanding the causes of the Great Depression as elucidated by Galbraith , we can observe the differences between the present and 1929 .
These reveal why today 's Depression will be even deeper than the 1929 - 1941 one and why today 's policy " fixes " as pursued by that great student of Depression , Ben Bernanke , are fighting the last war -- a Keynesian stimulus strategy doomed to catastrophic failure .
I hesitate to call this topic " important " because such announcements instantly cut my readership in half .
Thus I am inclined to call this topic " edgy , " " explosive " and " contrarian , " all of which sound more interesting than " important " ( yawn ) .
Galbraith begins his exploration of causes by noting that " economics does not allow final answers on these matters .
But , as usual , something can be said . "
First , he demolishes the notion that abundant credit caused a speculative orgy .
The long - accepted explanation that credit was easy and so people were impelled to borrow money to buy common stocks on margin is obviously nonsense .
( page 169 )
On numerous occasions before and since credit has been easy , and there has been no speculation whatever .
Furthermore , much of the 1928 and 1929 speculation occured on money borrowed at interest rates which would have been considered especially astringent .
Far more important that rate of interest and supply of the credit is the mood .
Speculation on a large scale requires a pervasive sense of confidence and optimism and conviction that ordinary people were meant to be rich .
( emphasis added , CHS ) Next , Galbraith looks to the wellspring of credit which has been virtually nonexistent in our current speculative boom : savings .
( Or at least domestic i.e. U.S. savings . )
Savings must also be plentiful .
If savings are growing rapidly , people will place a lower marginal value on their accumulation ; they will be willing to risk some of it against the prospect of a greatly enhanced return .
Speculative excess is somewhat self - regulating -- or should be unless manipulated by the very state which is pledged to protect the economy from such excesses .
Galbraith notes : Finally , a speculative outbreak has a greater or less immunizing effect .
The ensuing collapse automatically destroys the very mood speculation requires .
Moving from the causes of speculative excess to that of Depression , Galbraith rejects a cyclical cause : " No inevitable rhythm required the collapse and stagnation of 1930 - 1940 . "
As for the business cycle -- expansion of plant , credit and inventory once over - extended , requires a contraction to restore balance -- Galbraith grants it viability , but he rejects it as the cause of the Depression :
In 1929 the labor force was not tired ; it could have continued to produce indefinitely at the best 1929 rate .
The capital plant of the country was not depleted .
In the preceding years of prosperity , plant had been renewed and improved .
Finally , the high production of the twenties did not , as some have suggested , outrun the wants of the people .
There is no evidence that their desire for automobiles , clothing , travel .
recreation or even food was sated .
A depression was not needed so that people 's wants could catch up to their capacity to produce .
So then what did trigger the Great Depression ?
Galbraith sets aside the speculative collapse itself for a moment and digs for problems in the real economy .
He begins by noting worker productivity rose by 43 % between 1919 and 1929 even as wages , salaries and prices all remained comparatively stable .
This enabled increasing profits , which due to the large income disparities of the era , flowed largely to the well - to - do .
What did the wealthy do with this new - found capital ?
A large and increasing investment in capital goods was a principal device by which the profits were spent .
( page 175 )
It follows that anything that interrupted the investment outlays -- anything , indeed , which kept them from showing the neessary rate of increase -- could cause trouble .
The effect , therefore of insufficient investment -- investment that failed to keep pace with the steady increase in profits -- could be falling total demand reflected in turn in falling orders and output .
As I understand this , the proximate cause was a vast income disparity which placed much of the prosperous era's profits in the hands of a small wealthy class , who then mal - invested the profits .
If that is n't ringing some bells in your head , then please recall that income disparity , which fell from 1946 - 1970 or so , has been rising ever since .
Bingo -- profits flowed increasingly into the hands of a elite wealthy class who then squandered / mal - invested the vast profits , undermining the entire economy .
Galbraith then turns to the causal relations between the collapse of the speculative stock market and the ensuing Depression .
Once again , Galbraith fingers income disparity : 5 % of the populace garnered a full third of personal income .
This highly unequal income distribution meant that the economy was dependent on a high level of investment or a high level of luxury consumer spending or both .
The rich can not buy great quantities of bread .
If they are to dispose of what they receive it must be luxuries or by way of investment in new plants and new projects .
As the stock market crashed , those with the most to lose -- the wealthy -- found their cashflow and capital massively crimped .
Since the entire economy was dependent on them spending and investing freely , the economy crashed , too .
You see where this leads in terms of the 1990s - 2006 boom .
The stupendous profits skimmed in the great dot - com boom flowed disproportionately into a few hands , who then mal - invested the gains ( in a macro context ) in a completely unproductive burst of overbuilt housing and commercial real estate .
The ensuing bubble drew in all those who in Galbraith 's words believed they deserved to be rich and as those hapless speculators crashed they took the entire middle class of homeowners with them .
Galbraith also fingers two other causes of the Great Depression : Faulty corporate structure and flawed banking structure .
The parallels to the present are achingly obvious ; here 's Galbraith 's terse description :
The fact was that American enterprise in the twenties had opened its hospitable arms to an exceptional number of promoters , grafters , swindlers , imposters and frauds .
This , in in the long history of such activities , was a kind of flood tide of corporate larceny .
As gargantuan as the flood of corporate larceny was in the 20s , the present era certainly exceeds it by a large margin .
Here is Galbraith 's trenchant comment about the banking practices of the 20s : Since the early 30s , a generation of Americans has been told , sometimes with amusement , sometimes with indignation , often with outrage , of the banking practices of the late 20s .
In fact , many of those practices were made ludicrous only by the depression .
Loans which would have been pefectly good were made perfectly foolish by the collapse of the value of the collateral he had posted .
The same , I fear , cannot said of the present : millions of guaranteed - to - default mortgages made to impossibly unqualified borrowers were never good nor prudent .
The same can also be said of millions of auto / truck loans , millions of credit cards , millions of home equity lines of credit , etc .
Even worse , of course , the banks of the present era achieved heights of leverage via off - balance sheet derivatives , the securitization of mortgages and other financial legerdemaine that even the greediest , most venal bankers of the 20s could not even imagine .
Lastly , Galbraith blames " the dubious state of the foreign balance , " i.e. the imbalance of foreign trade and flow of funds .
In 1929 , the problem seems to be that the U.S. was a magnet for capital inflows even as it managed a trade surplus .
That imbalance doomed the global economy .
Now of course we face the opposite imbalance but the same result will follow : the U.S. continues to run a staggering , unprecendented trade imbalance even as it sucks up an unprecedented share of global capital / savings .
Galbraith concludes : " Had the economy been fundamentally sound in 1929 the effect of the great stock market crash might have been small .
But business in 1929 was not sound ; on the contrary it was exceedingly fragile .
It was vulnerable to the kind of blow it received from Wall Street . "
You mean like the evaporation of $ 12 trillion wealth we 've just experienced in the U.S. ?
But the present is far more fragile and vulnerable than the U.S. economy of 1929 , for the following reasons .
In 1955 Galbraith could not possibly have foreseen or anticipated these current conditions : 1 . A Federal government which since the " Reagan Revolution " of 1981 ( e.g. do n't tax and spend , just borrow and spend ) has borrowed during so - called good times on a scale once reserved for rare Keynesian stimulus to combat serious recession .
Thus we find ourselves at unprecedented levels of debt ( comparable in terms of GDP to the entire cost of World War II ) and our current Depression has barely begun .
2 . A corrupt - to - the - core corporate structure riddled with bogus accounting , reliance on financial trickery for profits and misdirected / worthless regulatory oversight .
3 . A banking sector of such debauchery and fraud that the excesses of the 1920s are reduced to the pranks of slighty - naughty choirboys and girls .
4 . A Federal system of entitlements ( Medicare , Medicaid and Social Security ) which has grown far faster than the underlying economy for decades and now threatens the very solvency of the government itself , so stupendous are the future obligations .
5 . A global military hegemony which costs more than all the other militarys and intelligence operations of the entire world put together .
The U.S. military consumes more oil than the nation of Sweden ( 9 million residents ) .
6 . An industrial , transportation and energy infrastructure that , rather than being rebuilt during the past 26 years of debt - based " prosperity , " has crumbled in a long decline .
Rather than invest in electrical power grids and energy - efficient transport systems , the U.S. squandered the trillions of borrowed dollars on toys , gewgaws , electronics made elsewhere , malls and commercial towers with only transient value and millions of bloated , inefficient poorly constructed homes no one needed or could afford : " assets " which were not productive at all , " assets " which are now capital traps on a scale heretofore unimaginable 7 .
A paucity of U.S. savings ( and thus of domestic capital ) with only one historical parallel : the depths of the Great Depression when unemployment was 25 % .
8 . A huge reliance on financial leverage , debt , borrowing and trickery for corporate profits ; the U.S. exports soybeans , increasingly worthless dollars and " financial innovations " which are now exploding in economies from Ireland to India with the destructive force of superweapons .
In exchange for this dubious paper , we have accepted actual tangible goods from the rest of the world .
They are now slowly waking up to the fact they 've been conned on a scale few can grasp .
9 . Globalization has reworked the global supply chain in an astonishingly brief period of time .
As a result , the arbitrage of currencies ( foreign exchange a.k.a. forex ) , wages , governance ( less is more profitable ) and environmental regulations ( zero is the most profitable ) have all placed advanced post - industrial economies like the U.S. at great structural disadvantages .
10 . The U.S. claims to be competitive but much of this competitiveness is highly selective and thus illusory .
Everything in the U.S. -- labor , goods , buildings and taxes -- is high - cost , overregulated ( except for finance , banking and governance ) and vulnerable to unpredictable lawsuits and officially sanctioned looting .
Other than recent immigrants , non-U.S. employers find the workforce is often surly , unappreciative , narcissistic , entitlement - obsessed , unhealthy , poorly educated , unmotivated and more inclined to get - rich - quick schemes than actual enterprise or productivity .
The middle management labors under impossible demands to enrich stockholders next quarter and heavy turnover insures few stay in any job long enough to learn it effectively .
Team cooperation is a doublespeak fraud imposed by " facilitators , " creating a phony work environment where employees and managers alike pretend to care .
This bogus environment breeds a looting , game - the - system mentality in which everyone is grabbing for all they can before retirement , restructuring , reassignment , resignation or getting fired .
A " quarterly profits are God " mentality reduces the workforce ( even the good workers ) to units of input which are pared back or hired without regard to morale or loyalty .
This managerial and cultural pathology makes a mockery of worker loyalty and breeds the very qualities of distrust and " I got mine " attitude which undermines both productivity and workplace happiness .
11 . Last but certainly not least , the U.S. economy is highly depedent on cheap , abundant fossil fuels -- the very fuels which are in the global depletion phase , happy stories about unlimited natural gas and tar sands to the contrary .
For all these reasons , we can anticipate the Depression currently unfolding will be deeper , longer and more destructive than the Great Depression .
Let 's recount the chain of events which partly parallel the Great Depression and partly diverge in meaningfully more destructive ways from that previous era : 1 . The postwar income convergence ( i.e the rise of the great middle class , the reduction of poverty and the relative reduction of the Plutocracy 's share of national income ) reverses in the early 1970s as the " true prosperity " of the postwar era ends and is replaced by income flowing increasingly to the top as stagflation , globalization and the decline of dollar gut the purchasing power of the middle class .
2 . The rising productivity of the 50s and 60s slips to the flatline through the 70s and early 80s , only picking up again as computer software and hardware revolutionize the back office , sales , manufacturing , just - in - time shipping / production , etc.
3 . Concurrent with this gradual return to productivity is the rise of finance as the key profit - center of corporate America .
As income skews ever more heavily to the top 1%/5 % , then capital ( productive assets ) become ever more heavily concentrated in the hands of the financial Plutocracy .
The top 1 % now owns some 2/3 of the nation 's entire productive wealth .
4 . As profits rise ( from rising productivity ) then the profits flow not to wages ( which remain flat to down 1975 - 2009 for all but the top 10 % professional class ) but to those who own the capital .
5 . As the middle class experiences a decline in their income and purchasing power ( for reasons cited above : declining dollar , rising income disparity , and wages falling due to global wage arbitrage ) then they turn more and more to borrowing and ever greater debt to fund what they have been brainwashed by the media to believe is " the American dream " of imported luxury goods , bloated homes , vacuous cruises , etc .
The only other mechanism available to the middle class to increase household income is for Mom / Aunt / Grandmom to enter the workforce , which she does in the tens of millions , with sociological consequences which are still unfolding .
6 . This advert / media - driven desire to borrow to fund the " good life " is hugely profitable to the money - center banks , which expand rapidly into mortgage securization , derivatives and consumer credit to the point that they come to dominate corporate profits .
7 . The financial Plutocracy , observing that actually producing goods is not very profitable unless you can fix prices as per ADM ( Archer Daniels Midlands ) or gain government subsidies and tax giveaways ( oil lease depreciation , etc. ) sinks its capital into the FIRE economy ( finance , insurance and real estate ) , eschewing real - world investments as comparatively unprofitable .
Though rarely noted , this is a longstanding trait of capitalism stretching back to 1400 - era Venice .
When trade became less profitable than mainland farmimg , the Venetian Elite stopped funding trading and bought farms on the mainland .
As a side effect , Venice ceased to be a military and trading power .
But the Elite remained immensely wealthy .
8 . As the tech bubble expands , middle - class investors see the Plutocracy ( those with enough capital to qualify as angel investors and vulture , oops , I mean venture capital ) reaping huge gains , and they enter the dot - com stock bubble buildup with a vengeance .
9 . In a happy accident , the Soviet Empire collapses just as productivity begins its computer - fueled rise in the U.S.
In a so - called Unipolar World in which U.S. military , political and financial influence is unrivaled , non-U.S. investors seek the relative safety and high returns ( based on appreciation of the dollar ) of U.S. financial instruments .
10 .
The dot - com bubble implodes in a speculative meltdown ( dot- bomb ) , and retail investors ( a.k.a. the middle class 401K investors ) are devastated .
The ephemeral wealth they once possessed , however briefly , fuels their speculative desire to get into the next get - rich - quick game , which just so happens to be " something everyone understands : " real estate and housing .
11 . Having exhausted the dot - com play , Elite capital is seeking a new high - profit home .
The miracles of derivatives ( CDOs , credit default swaps , etc. ) and securitized debt ( mortgage tranches , etc. ) open up vast new opportunities for leverage , off - balance sheet shenanigans and outright fraud / debauchery of credit .
As chip wafer plants disappear from Silicon Valley ( too dirty , too costly , etc. ) then they 're replaced with paper : mortgage - backed securities .
12 . Sniffing gold in them thar exurban hills , the under - capitalized and over - indebted U.S. working class and middle class reach for the chalice of easy - money gold : leveraged real estate .
13 .
With the Federal financial regulatory agencies in a Republican / Democrat - enforced somnambulance , the coast is clear for brigands , shysters , fraudsters , con artists , liars , cheats , and assorted riff - raff in the realtor , mortgage and appraisal businesses , who all feed the ravenous maw of the money - center banks ' apparently limitless appetite for real estate assets to securitize and leverage in exotic and highly profitable ways .
14 .
For a wonderful five years circa 2001 - 2006 , the game is afoot and no - down - payment Jill and $ 100 million bonus Jack are immensely enriched .
Meanwhile , the underlying real economy is becoming ever more imbalanced and ever more fragile as real production and real productivity plummet as everyone rushes to the speculative riches of exurban McMansions and malls .
15 .
This last best speculative leveraged bubble pops , gutting a Wall Street which had grown utterly dependent on leverage , debt , gamed / fraudulent accounting and bubbles for its rising profits .
16 .
Doubly devastated by the implosion of housing and their stock investments ( mostly in retirement funds ) , the middle class faces the terrible consequences of its 26 - year stupor of ever - rising debt and leverage .
Alas , the Emperor 's clothes are revealed as remarkably transparent .
17 . Just as in the Great Depression , to its great surprise , the Elite has also suffered catastrophic losses and declines in capital and income .
18 . Having borrowed and squandered trillions of dollars since 1981 on unaffordable entitlements , military misadventures and assorted worthless bridges - to - nowhere pork spending , the Federal government ( The Fed and the Treasury ) finds that its ability to borrow its way out of its current debt hole somewhat annoyingly limited .
The rest of the world has finally caught on to the con , and Chinese university students are openly mocking Treasury Secretary Geithner 's Orwellian claim of " we support a strong dollar . "
The miracle is that he was not pelted with tomatoes and tarred and feathered for making such absurd statements .
19 .
With the global media concentrated in a scant few corporate hands ( less than 10 ) , this pulling away of the curtain is deleted / excised from media coverage in a ruthless campaign of pure " green shoots " propaganda .
20 .
As the wheels fall off the U.S. economy and the bubbles cannot be re-inflated , fruitless attempts at holding back the tide with incantations ( stop , tide , I am Obama / Geithner / Bernanke ! ) and loopy sand castles ( the bottom is in , buy now !
Green shoots are sprouting everywhere except in the real economy ! ) abound .
Unresponsive to propaganda , the real world grinds down into a global Depression without visible end .
Is this " edgy " enough to be worthy ?
I hope so .

Everyone knows the impact Google has had on both the net world & the real world .
With Google trying to actively list & maintain all the touch points to any piece of information , it only makes sense that Hollywood would have issues with Google & the other search engines .
People want information & access to anything instantly .
Google feeds this desire by returning blazingly quick results any time someone enters a query in to the site .
It ’s from this ability to be only one click away from a competitor is what frightens Hollywood so much .
With the click of a mouse , I could download the latest movie in the theatres – with minimal chance of getting caught – & while the quality & convenience is n’t to the same level as a DVD release , if i am looking for free entertainment , it ’s easily obtainable .
Hollywood needs to embrace the new technology & it ’s ability to deliver what the people want .
Imagine walking out of a theatre with a fantastic movie you watched , & waiting for you was a representative from the studio with that exact movie you watched available on DVD .
$ 20 on the spot , & you have a top - quality version of the movie .
there is a delicate balance that must be determined because currently , DVD sales are what can turn a clunker in the theatres to a money maker in post release .
Hollywood also needs to figure out a way to let the consumer order a movie over the net by streaming , or even if I wanted to order a movie through my TiVo .
They need to generate an encryption technology that allows for only 1 copy to be made , & even have something that subtly alerts a viewer that the product they are watching has been copied .
This marking technology is already in place for DVD screener that the studio releases .
At a certain interval , there is a specific series of lights ( that usually form a letter or number ) which identifies to whom the screener was released to .
This way if that copy gets on the web , they not only have a quick reference point , but can also have a starting point as to how that movie got pirated .
Another thing that Hollywood needs to consider is the technology used to display it ’s products :
Film & a silver screen as seen through a dusty projector .
While the film enthusiast in me absolutely loves the look & feel of seeing a movie in the theatre , there is a huge segment of customers who purposely wait until the movie comes out on DVD basically because they have a better looking & better sounding technique at home to watch the movie with !
Hollywood had begun to reach it ’s commercial end by allowing for traditional advertising before a movie plays .
While I fully understand & recognize why it ’s being finished ( Russell Crow ai n’t cheap ! ) , it takes away from the movie experience .
I fully expect to see trailers for upcoming movies – but not commercials .
That ’s what television is for .
By including commercials before a movie gets played , they have connected the movie experience to that of watching the boob tube .
The search engines provide value , & Hollywood provides the experience .
Marrying the five would generate an instantaneous feeling of overwhelming satisfaction for the new age user .
It ’s in all of this that Hollywood & Google should get together & generate a solution that ’s amicable to everyone involved .
There will always be bootleggers – that ’s a given .
But if you can reduce the number of illegal downloads & copies being marketed , the studio can keep more of it ’s money used to get people to see their films in the first place .

I wanted to create an ultimate wooden architecture .
I thought through this bungalow , which can be considered as a small and primitive house , it was possible to do a primitive and simultaneously new architecture .
350 mm square profile cedar is piled endlessly .
At the end of the process appears a prototypical place before architecture became architecture .

Wood is amazingly versatile .
Due to its versatility , wood is used in a conventional wooden architecture by intentional differentiation in various places .
Not only in structures , such as columns and beams , but it can also be used in everything else from foundation , exterior wall , interior wall , ceiling , flooring , insulation , furniture , stairs to window frames .
I posit that if wood is indeed multifaceted , then conversely it should be possible to create architecture that fulfills all functions by one process , and by one way of using woods .
It is an inversion of versatility .
From that originates , new architecture that maintains an undifferentiated condition of the harmonized whole before function and role underwent mitosis .

350 mm square profile cedar has an amazing impact .
It transcends what we usually call “ wood ” and becomes “ an existence ” of an entirely different material .
While the dimensions adequately display its materiality as wood , 350 mm squared is simultaneously the dimensionality directly corresponding to human body .
Thus , three - dimensional space is created out of 350 mm increments .
This stepped space was a long fascination of mine for couple of years as its defining characteristics are the generation of a sort of spatial relativity and a new sense of various distances unachievable by coplanar floors .

There are no categorization of floors , walls , and ceilings here .
A locality that was thought as a floor transforms into chairs , ceilings , and walls from different perspectives .
Floor levels are relative and people reinterpret the spatiality according to where they are .
People are three - dimensionally distributed in space and will experience new sensations of depths .
Spaces are not divided but is rather produced as a chance occurrence within fusing elements .
Inhabitants discover various functions within those undulations .
It is a place akin to nebulous landscape .
This resonates with the undifferentiated condition of above - mentioned architectonic elements .
Both as a constructional methodology and experiential space , this architecture is synthesized by the fusion of various undifferentiated elements .
Here , conventional rules of architecture is nullified .
There is neither a plan nor a stabilizing point .
This is possible purely because the wood is that versatile .
Perhaps it is only possible with wood to be simultaneously the insulation and the structure , the finish and also the furniture .
By being composed of the wooden blocks instead of slabs , the method of creating the undifferentiated condition was made clear .

I think this bungalow ceases to be within the domain of wooden architecture .
If architecture made from wood is to be considered wooden architecture , then this bungalow is the wood itself that transcends the architectural convention to directly become a place for humans .
It is of primordial existence before architecture .
That is to say , rather than new architecture , it seeks new conception , a new existence .

With a shaky economy and tightening credit terms , it can be easy to be paranoid about your credit score .
If you ’re planning a major financing or recovering from bad credit , it ’s not unsurprising that you ’d be as self conscious and mindful about your credit score as a supermodel would be about her ( or his ) weight .
But you ca n’t let the fear of straying from that ideal number rule your life .
Just controlling your waistline is a matter of understanding the effects of diet and exercise on your body , keeping you credit health on the up and up is a matter of understanding what kinds of events affect your credit and which do not .
Read on to learn about five things that do n’t affect your credit score range .
1. Soft Pulls
While looking over your credit report ( which you should do once a year – the government gives you a free credit report every 12 months ) , you may have noticed some unfamiliar inquiries into your account .
Even though “ number of recent inquiries ” does appear on FICO ’s list of items that affect your credit score , you should n’t worry about the bulk of the inquiries that appear on your credit report .
This is because , unless you authorized the inquiry , all retrievals of your credit history are considered “ soft pulls ” and do not affect your overall credit score .
They are simply shown on your credit history for your information .
FICO classifies three types of “ soft pulls ” :
“ Promotional inquiries ” that are initiated by lenders to “ pre-screen ” you to see if you are “ pre-approved ” for a credit card .
If you are , they ’ll send you junk mail , but it wo n’t affect your credit score .
“ Administrative inquiries ” that are initiated by lenders with whom you already have an account .
These are done just to review your account with them and are n’t a red flag to other companies .
“ Consumer initiated inquiries ” are when you retrieve your own credit history and obviously do n’t affect your score .
FICO also will not ding you when your employer checks your credit history , as this is standard operating procedure for some pre-employment screening .
So what is FICO referring to when it mentions “ recent credit inquiries ” and why does anyone care ?
Basically , this is a gauge of how many loans you actually applied for .
If you tried to sign up for 6 credit cards in one year , that ’s a bit fishy .
It means either ( A ) you are borrowing irresponsibly or ( B ) you are getting rejected for credit cards .
Note , though , that some utility companies , banks and phone service providers also do hard pulls .
But do n’t worry – “ recent credit inquiries ” is only a fraction of the “ new credit ” piece of the pie that composes 10 % of your overall score .
If you are still worried , find a list of companies that initiate hard pulls on your account .
2. Your Age , Race , Creed , Gender or Marital Status
Ever feel like you got snubbed for a loan because you were a 75 year old atheist , Pennsylvanian , polygamist , celibate , hermaphrodite who voted for Kodos ?
If you did , then it ’s probably not true and definitely not because those things showed up on your FICO score .
While some lending institutions – that is the banker or loan officer sitting across the desk from you who says “ No ” based on his or her own judgment – may be guilty of redlining , FICO recognizes that “ U.S. law prohibits credit scoring from considering ” race , color , sex , religion , national origin , and marital status “ as well as any receipt of public assistance , or the exercise of any consumer right under the Consumer Credit Protection Act . ”
So , know that while people may be prejudiced , your credit score is not .
3. Credit Counseling
If you are in over your head in debt , you may need to seek professional help from a credit counselor .
This is a difficult decision as it takes a certain amount of initiative and pride - swallowing .
The concession of retaining the services of a credit counselor is nearly akin to declaring bankruptcy in that you are admitting that you are unable to handle your liabilities on your own .
But unlike bankruptcy , signing up for credit counseling does not appear on your credit history and does not affect your credit score .
This is because you are not receiving any protection from the law or declaring any kind of change in your status .
You are n’t liquidating your possessions or formally stating that your liabilities surpass your assets .
You are merely seeking advice and guidance from a private party .
While hearing that you have had credit counseling may make a loan officer believe that you ’ve had problems with debt , this is purely a subjective call on the lender ’s part .
FICO has no idea whether or not you ’ve had counseling , and thus wo n’t factor it into your credit score .
Note , though , that some of the measures that your credit counselor suggests may indeed affect your score .
If they recommend a debt consolidation loan , refinancing or bankruptcy , then these things will very likely affect your score .
A reputable credit counselor will fully apprise you of the repercussions before asking you to proceed .
4. Authorized Users
On the topic of debt counselors , one recent change to FICO ’s scoring has effectively put the bushel over a common quick fix for bad credit that was commonly employed by disreputable credit repair institutions .
Up until August 2009 , you could sign up an “ authorized user ” to your account with a better credit score than yours and your FICO score would see a significant increase .
This method of “ piggybacking ” on the good reputation of another user has since been put to rest by FICO 08 .
So , if a credit counselor or debt repair whiz suggest the strategy , decline for two good reasons : ( 1 ) it ’s unethical and ( 2 ) it does n’t work .
5 . “ Any information that is not proven to be predictive of future credit performance . ”
On FICO ’s list of “ What ’s not in your credit score ” there ’s a catchall item that reads “ any information that is not proven to be predictive of future credit performance . ”
So , what does this mean exactly ?
It includes quite a few things – all of which wo n’t appear on your credit report :
Your employment history and your level of income .
This can get reported in government surveys , standardized tests , employment applications , medical forms and more , so it ’s easy to feel like “ they ” might be using this information against you .
But fret not – this data is usually collected for statistical analysis and does not affect your credit score .
In fact , it ’s illegal .
That ’s not to say that you are entitled to a loan if you ’re unemployed – again , that ’s the loan officer ’s call and has nothing to do with your FICO score .
Rental agreements .
Some people believe that they are stereotyped as low income individuals if they rent rather than own their homes .
While a lease is a legal document and some landlords may pull your credit report , the fact that you are a renter does n’t affect your credit score .
Now , if you default on your lease and the items is sent to collections , then you ’re busted .
But if you are a responsible renter , then fear not .
State or city of residence .
True , your credit report does show your current address .
But that has no quantifiable affect on your likelihood of repaying your loans or not .
Do n’t worry – living in Las Vegas does n’t flag you as irresponsible .
Interest rates on your other accounts .
Experian , TransUnion and Equifax do n’t tell lenders what kind of interest rate you are being charged .
FICO does n’t care either .
If all your interest rates seem to be hovering around the same number , it ’s likely because your lenders used similar formulas to arrive at the number , not because they are in cahoots .
All in all , it ’s better not to be paranoid or overly clever about your credit score .
Just like eating in moderation and getting plenty of exercise is the best way to stay slim and fit , controlling your spending and matching your lifestyle to your income is the best way to keep your credit healthy .
While FICO ’s formula is n’t exactly public knowledge , it ’s not quite as mysterious as we all believe it to be .
Practice common sense and responsible spending habits and you ’ll have little to worry about .
( CNN ) -- Authorities have charged two teenagers and an adult in connection with the beating of a 76 - year - old African - American man early Tuesday in Baltimore , Maryland , in an incident police say had a racial connection .
From left , Emmanuel Miller , 16 , and Zachary Watson , 17 are charged as adults in the alleged beating .
Emmanuel Miller , 16 , and Zachary Watson , 17 are charged as adults , police said .
They and Calvin Lockner , 28 , face numerous charges in the alleged beating of James Privott , including attempted murder , assault and harassing a person because of race or religion , according to court documents .
Lockner is a white supremacist with the nickname " Hitler , " Baltimore police spokesman Anthony Gugliemi told CNN .
Baltimore Police Commissioner Fred Bealefeld told reporters some of Lockner 's tattoos seem to indicate his affiliation with racist groups such as the Aryan Brotherhood , according to audio comments posted on the Web site of CNN affiliate WBAL .
There is no evidence the teenagers were affiliated with any white supremacist groups , Gugliemi said , but the two knew Lockner .
Police responding to a report of an armed carjacking about 3:25 a.m. Tuesday found Privott with a head injury , according to probable cause statements accompanying charges , filed in the District Court of Maryland for Baltimore City .
Privott told police he was loading his Chevy Tahoe after fishing in the nearby Patapsco River when three or four white males approached him and began to kick and punch him , knocking him to the ground while using racial epithets , according to the statements .
One of the men struck him with a baseball bat , Privott said .
While he was on the ground , the men stole his wallet , which contained $ 19 , as well as the keys to his vehicle , he told police .
The men left in the Tahoe , the statements said .
Privott was taken to a hospital and later was transferred to the University of Maryland Hospital 's shock trauma center because of his head injuries .
Doctors told police he had a possible fractured eye orbital bone and had sustained serious head trauma , according to the court documents .
Privott remained in critical condition , but was making progress , a Baltimore police spokeswoman said Thursday
" What has happened is an unfortunate thing , " Privott 's wife , Ethel , told WBAL .
" I think we 're living in a prison world because we can't -- we 're not safe here .
We go and try to have clean fun and this is what happens . "
The Chevy Tahoe 's tracking system helped police locate the vehicle , which eventually crashed and overturned , the court documents said .
An anonymous witness led officers to Lockner after seeing him running from the accident scene .
As he was being arrested , Lockner told police , " I 'm sorry for what I did , " according to the probable cause statements .
Lockner told police he was involved in the beating , but said another man -- later identified by police as Watson -- was the one who assaulted Privott and took his wallet .
Both Miller and Watson , however , told police it was Lockner who assaulted Privott , according to the court documents .
Watson claimed Lockner used a sledgehammer and Miller used a bat .
Both youth said Lockner forced them into the Tahoe after the assault , according to the statements .
Watson said the three then smoked marijuana , police said .
Bealefeld told reporters that while authorities have received conflicting information from the three , " I think the consensus is that Mr. Lockner played a leading role in a lot of this . "
Miller said , according to the probable cause statements , that he , Lockner and Watson were at Fort Armistead Park near the river when they saw Privott and a woman fishing .
Miller said the three asked the man and woman if they had any water or cigarettes , but they said no .
Lockner grew angry at their refusal , Miller told police , and used a racial epithet as they were walking away , the documents said .
Miller said the three waited for the woman with Privott to leave and then Lockner assaulted him , hitting him about 10 times , according to the probable cause statements .
Ethel Privott told WBAL the two enjoy fishing near the park and have been doing so for more than a decade .
" It 's usually a party , " she said , but the two had stayed late on Tuesday .
" A lot of seniors go down there .
It 's a nice secluded area , and we have fun .
Until this , " she said .
A preliminary hearing for all three suspects is set for September 18 .

Ninjas – along with pirates – are an interesting phenomenon that have worked their way into the hearts of every man , woman and child on this planet .
Why ?
Simply because they are pretty damn awesome .
Just as it says on the t- shirt , ninjas outperform pirates in just about every capacity imaginable , and the restaurant business is no different .
The restaurant itself is entirely ninja - themed , right down to staff in full ninja regalia surprising guests by jumping from the ceiling , simultaneously offering to take them to their seat whilst launching a projectile weapon into their face ( the latter may or may not actually happen ) .
The outing itself is on the whole a pricier night out than most , but customer reviews of the “ experience ” rate it as extremely positive , both in terms of the ninja aspect and the quality of the food , which itself arrives in a variety of ways , from the salad hidden inside an eggshell , to a dish being covered in dry ice , invoking a “ mysterious ” atmosphere and even the menu is ninja-tastic , being written entirely on a scroll .
On top of all this , one particular dish involves the recipient removing a sword from the container , only to have dry ice gush out .
They also have a branch in New York , for those living less locally to Tokyo .
Opinion The Human Face of Burma 's Tragedy
Britain 's prime minister is calling the conviction of Burmese pro-democracy activist Aung San Suu Kyi a " show trial . "
In a guest editorial , Gordon Brown argues the international community must be firm in its stance against the Burmese regime , which is " virtually alone in the scale of its misrule . "

The “ Glenn Becks ” and “ Michelle Malkins ” of the world , with a little help from certain GOP legislators like House Minority Whip Eric Cantor , have a new conspiracy they would like the right - wing fringe to adopt : “ The Czar – Shadow Government ” theory .
FOX has been giving a lot of time to this idea lately , and I ’m starting to hear it arise in common conversation , so I thought it best to set aside my usual Friday “ Chaos Theory ” installment , and tackle this issue instead .
This latest idea involves the following concerns / claims :
1 - There are about 30 of these “ czars ” in the administration … they are not subject to Senate confirmation , yet supposedly wield tremendous power .
This unrestrained power in the hands of “ unchecked ” individuals represents part of Obama ’s desire to form some sort of “ shadow government ” that operates outside the purview of Congress .
2 - There is an insinuation … that because these officials are called “ czars “ … and because “ czars ” is a term derived from Russian history … and because Russia once a communist nation … that the czars represent yet another sign that America is becoming Socialist / Marxist / Communist .
Politico.com , did a further disservice to this debate in an article where the author , Lisa Leher , seemed to have no knowledge of who the “ czars ” actually were , she proceeded to misidentify several individuals as examples of czars ( the people she mistakenly named , the “ California Water Czar aka Deputy Secretary of the Interior ” and the “ Border Czar aka Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for International Affairs and Special Representative for Border Affairs ” … actually DO undergo Senate confirmation ) , and then she misrepresented the czars as having significant “ power . ”
So …let ’s address each of the claims above with a few important facts :
1 – CLAIM – Czars are unconfirmed posts with lots of power :
There are around 30 people commonly nicknamed as czars
These are not really “ czars . ”
That is to say , not only are they not members of the long extinct Russian monarchic family … they are also not even really titled “ czars . ” “ Czar ” is just a cute , media - friendly nickname that Presidents and the media have been using since President Nixon .
These people actually have real , official job titles … these cumbersome names are often replaced by “ Such - and - such Czar ” when the President or the media talks about these people because it is easier and less confusing .
The Washington Independent provides the following examples :
“ Pre-exisiting jobs :
“ AIDS Czar ” – Actually the Director of the Office of National AIDS Policy , created in 2001 by George W. Bush .
“ Border Czar ” – Actually the Department of Homeland Security Assistant Secretary for International Affairs and Special Representative for Border Affairs , created in 2003 by George W. Bush .
“ California Water Czar ” – Actually the Deputy Secretary of the Interior , who was given this extra portfolio by Secretary Ken Salazar in June .
“ Central Region Czar ” – The Special Assistant to the President and Senior Director for the “ Central Region , ” on the Nation Security Council .
“ Drug Czar ” – Actually the Director of the Office of National Drug Control Policy , created in 1989 by George H.W. Bush .
“ Faith - Based Czar ” – Head of the White House Office of Faith - Based and Neighborhood Partnerships , created in 2001 by George W. Bush .
“ Intelligence Czar ” – This is actually the Director of National Intelligence , a position created in 2005 .
“ TARP Czar ” – Actually the Assistant Secretary of the Treasury for Financial Stability of the United States Herb Allison , who was confirmed by the Senate in June .
“ Weapons Czar ” – Not actually an executive branch position , but the Under Secretary of Defense for Acquisition , Technology and Logistics .
New jobs held by eminent people or people previously confirmed by the Senate :
“ Afghanistan Czar ” – Actually the United States Special Envoy for Afghanistan and Pakistan , and the man holding that job , Richard Holbrooke went through a Senate confirmation hearing in 1999 when he became Bill Clinton ’s U.N. ambassador .
“ Economic Czar ” – Actually the President ’s Economic Recovery Board , chaired by Paul Volcker , the deeply uncontroversial former chairman of the Federal Reserve .
“ Energy and Environment Czar ” – This is Carol Browner , the Assistant to the President for Energy and Climate Change , who was confirmed by the U.S. Senate in 1993 to run the Environmental Protection Agency under Bill Clinton .
“ Guantanamo Closure Czar ” – Actually the Special Envoy to Guantanamo , Daniel Fried , who was the final Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs in the Bush administration . ”
These positions … the majority of them PRE - DATE Obama .
That is , they were created by earlier Presidents , and while the “ czar ” nickname originated with Nixon , many of the positions referred to as “ czars ” go even further back .
Obama .
That is , they were created by earlier Presidents , and while the “ czar ” nickname originated with Nixon , many of the positions referred to as “ czars ” go even further back .
These so - called “ czars “ … most of them have tiny staffs , tiny budgets and the one thing that almost all of them have in common is actually their near - complete lack of power .
They have the authority and resources to make only the smallest of policy decisions , and generally serve more as advisors to the president and Congress on specific areas of policy interest .
2 – CLAIM – Czars …are part of some sort of Communist shift in American ideology :
Really ?
A group of thirty government policy bureaucrats who have almost NO authority…used by both Republican and Democrat Presidents alike ?
Most of which were added during the George W. Bush presidency ?
Does n’t seem to pass the “ pinko ” test .
authority…used by both Republican and Democrat Presidents alike ?
Most of which were added during the George W. Bush presidency ?
Does n’t seem to pass the “ pinko ” test .
Umm …for the record , the Czars ( or Tsars ) in Russia were an aristocratic MONARCHY .
They significantly predated Communism …by about 200 years .
.
They significantly predated Communism …by about 200 years .
The reason “ czar ” is used , besides being shorter than the officials ’ real titles , is to imply that these people are responsible for overseeing and being experts on their given area .
We can and should file that under “ d ” for “ duh . “
In short …to my conservative friends who are officially watching WAY to much FOX News if they are obsessing over this one : it ’s a handy media nickname for policy bureaucrats and advisors .
The same bureaucrats who two years ago you proudly claimed were Bush ’s “ brain trust ” and the reason that it was acceptable for the President to not know anything about anything .
You would explain that these people were Bush ’s “ circle of experts ” who advised him on all things foreign and domestic .
So , what has changed to so dramatically sway your opinion of czars ?
Oh yeah … there ’s a new person in charge of them .
Here ’s Rachel Maddow ’s treatment on the subject :
( E)ven if Obama gets all this through , it will not address the fundamental problem .
Which is that the cost of healthcare keeps going up — because of an ageing population , a revolution in medical and pharmaceutical technology and a structure that rewards doctors for prescribing an unlimited amount of medication and surgery .
If you look at the current house bill with the most steam behind it , this is what the Congressional Budget Office says it will do to costs :
“ The net cost of the coverage provisions would be growing at a rate of more than 8 % per year in nominal terms between 2017 and 2019 ; we would anticipate a similar trend in the subsequent decade . ”
That means almost no industry will exist in the US in the next decade except healthcare .
And that ’s because every other industry will go bankrupt trying to pay for it .
How does GM compete when it has to pay a medical bill that German car companies largely leave to the government ?
( Emphasis mine )
The islanders see things differently .
They say these beaches were designated as a National Seashore Recreation Area in 1937 , and that access for vehicles was guaranteed .
Some of the best surf fishing in the US is to be had here , and locals say that if the fishermen go , so will their livelihoods .

Southern Italy ’s busiest freight city has received a glorious green centerpiece to its mountainous landscape .
The Vulcano Buono , “ good volcano ” in Italian , was designed to merge with this Italian landscape , in homage to the once tragic nearby Mt. Vesuvius volcano just a few miles away .
Vulcano Buono houses a shopping mall , an outdoor theater , restaurants and a hotel– all contained within a rolling green roof comprised of over 2,500 thriving plants .
The central eye of this man-made volcano spans 150 meters of open space for an extension of the market within .
The focus of architect Renzo Piano was to create “ a contemporary take on a greek marketplace , a void as a place for events , meetings , dialogue and the gathering of people ” .
Having integrated this building into it ’s landscape , instead of just occupying it , it is clear that Mr. Piano and crew have succeeded brilliantly .

Silkworms have long been the basis of the world 's silk industry but new Australian research points to a possible future mulberry tree - free alternative .
Scientists at CSIRO
Entomology have found that silk made by the common Australian green lacewing is much tougher and can be stretched up to six times further than silkworm silk .
More importantly , according to the research to be published in the Journal of Structural Biology , its unusual structure makes it potentially much easier to manufacture artificially .
The findings are part of ongoing work at the CSIRO involving the categorisation of insects that produce silk - from wasps , to ants , water beetles and even fleas .
By looking at the variations and commonalities in the silks , the researchers hope to soon find an effective and efficient method of producing artificial silk .
Smart structures
The common Australian green lacewing ( Mallada signata ) uses silk to create tiny stiff stalks to hold each of its eggs on .
The delicate insect pushes out a liquid drop of silk dope before stretching it out to the point at which it stiffens and then placing the egg safely on top .
It was these stalks and the way they were created that attracted the researchers ' attention .
They found that the lacewing silk was unrelated to the silk created by other insects and had had its own evolutionary pathway .
Unlike the plank - like structure of other silks from spiders or silkworms , lacewing silk contains two fibrous proteins structured like a concertina door , giving it extra toughness and elasticity .
The lacewing silk protein is also shorter and less repetitive .
Therefore it may be more easily reproduced artificially by fermentation in bacteria , says Dr Tara Sutherland , part of the CSIRO research team .
Sutherland and her colleagues are now in the middle of experimenting with ways of doing that .
" Silks are made under benign conditions .
They 're made at room temperature , from an aqueous system and from readily replaced building blocks , so it 's a very environmentally friendly process , in contrast to the synthetic equivalents , " she says .
Applications
There is almost as much excitement about silk in the world 's entomology laboratories as on the fashion catwalk .
" The material has a lot of strength and it 's very , very light so it 's quite remarkable .
It 's also very tough , " says Sutherland .
In addition to traditional textile uses , the biocompatibility of the natural fibre means that it is being increasingly used in high - tech medical applications such as providing the scaffolding for growing new human cells on .
Silk produced by silkworms is limited in its use , as scientists have n't been able to control the form of the material except with a complicated dissolving and reforming process .
" That 's quite a difficult process to do , " says Sutherland .
" And there 's some concern that when you try to remake it into the form that you want , you 're not mimicking all the properties in the natural material . "
The ultimate goal is to artificially create insect silk , complete with its strong , beautiful and environmentally friendly natural properties , says Sutherland .
The common Australia green lacewing could be the one to provide the best way forward .

The increasingly competitive browser market has at last created an environment in which emerging Web standards can flourish .
One of the harbingers of the open Web renaissance is HTML 5 , the next major version of the W3 C 's ubiquitous HTML standard .
Although HTML 5 is still in the draft stage , several of its features have already been widely adopted by browsers like Safari , Chrome , and Firefox .
Among the most compelling is the " video " element , which has the potential to free Web video from its plugin prison and make video content a native first - class citizen on the Web — if codec disagreements do n't stand in the way .
In an article last month , we explored the challenges and opportunities associated with the HTML 5 video element .
One of the most significant of these challenges is the lack of consensus around a standard media codec , a contentious issue that has rapidly escalated into a major controversy .
The debate has now stalled without a clear resolution in sight .
The HTML 5 working group is split between supporters of Ogg Theora and H.264 .
Their inability to find a compromise that is acceptable to all stakeholders has compelled HTML 5 spec editor Ian Hickson to " admit defeat " and give up on the effort to define specific codecs and media formats in the standard itself .
This is problematic because the lack of uniform codec availability will make it impossible for content creators to publish their videos in a single format that will be viewable through the HTML 5 video element in all browsers .
In an e-mail posted to the WHATWG mailing list , Hickson outlined the positions of each major browser vendor and explained how the present impasse will influence the HTML 5 standard .
Apple and Google favor H.264 while Mozilla and Opera favor Ogg Theora .
Google intends to ship its browser with support for both codecs , which means that Apple is the only vendor that will not be supporting Ogg .
" After an inordinate amount of discussions , both in public and privately , on the situation regarding codecs for < video > and < audio > in HTML5 , I have reluctantly come to the conclusion that there is no suitable codec that all vendors are willing to implement and ship , " Hickson wrote .
" I have therefore removed the two subsections in the HTML5 spec in which codecs would have been required , and have instead left the matter undefined . "
Ogg Theora is an open format that is thought to be unencumbered by patents .
The primary reference implementation is distributed under an open source license and it is being developed by the non-profit Xiph.org with funding from Mozilla .
Ogg is strongly preferred by the open source software community because it can be freely redistributed without requiring licensing fees .
H.264 is a high - performance codec that is maintained by the ISO Moving Picture Experts Group ( MPEG ) as part of the MPEG - 4 family .
It is emerging as the dominant codec for both streaming video and optical media , as it is said to deliver the visual quality of MPEG - 2 ( used on DVDs ) at roughly half the bitrate .
The MPEG LA consortium manages licensing of the underlying patents that cover H.264 compression algorithms and other software methods needed to implement the codec .
In order to use the format , adopters have to pay licensing fees to MPEG LA .
Patent problems
Patent encumbrance is one of the driving forces behind the HTML 5 video codec controversy .
The patent licensing requirements mean that H.264 codecs can't be freely redistributed , making the format a non-starter for Mozilla and most other open source browser vendors .
Opera also objects , saying that the licensing fees are too high .
Mozilla and Opera strongly advocate Ogg Theora as an alternative because its freedom from known patents could ensure that there are no licensing barriers that prevent ubiquitous adoption .
Apple objects to Ogg Theora , claiming that the lack of known patents on Theora does n't rule out the threat of submarine patents that could eventually be used against adopters .
Apple is also concerned about the lack of widespread support for hardware - based Theora decoding , a factor that diminishes the format 's viability on mobile devices .
Google shares Apple 's skepticism about the potential of Theora in the marketplace .
The search giant claims that Theora 's lack of quality relative to H.264 will make it an impractical choice for large - scale streaming video services such as YouTube .
Obtaining a license for H.264 from MPEG LA does n't guarantee complete immunity from patent infringement liability , though .
Although it is generally assumed that MPEG LA controls all of the relevant intellectual property pertaining to H.264 implementations , there is still the possibility that a third - party which is not a member of the consortium has a broad patent covering related compression technology that it can independently enforce against MPEG LA licensees .
Although Theora is not known to infringe any patents , critics fear that enhancing it to make it competitive with the most modern and efficient codecs will greatly increase its exposure to infringement risks .
Some critics even contend that it's not possible to advance Theora without inevitably hitting a patent wall .
Another licensing issue that is often overlooked is the ambiguity of MPEG LA 's future patent royalty collection plans .
MPEG LA has established broadcast fees that licensees will be required to pay for distributing free ( or ad - supported ) streaming video content on the Internet .
These fees will not be instated until the end of 2010 , when the second H.264 licensing period goes into effect .
The language used in the current license treats Internet streaming just like over - the - air television , implying that the licensees will have to pay broadcast fees per-region .
That could prove to be extremely costly for Internet video providers who make their content available around the world .
MPEG LA has provided no guidance , clarification , or insight into what the broadcast licensing fees will look like .
When asked directly about the issue , MPEG LA representatives say that they have n't even decided yet themselves .
The worry is that H.264 licensing for content distributors could potentially become too costly to sustain widespread use for streaming Internet video .
( For more details about MPEG LA licensing eccentricity , you can refer Jan Ozer 's concise overview at the Streaming Learning Center .
Another good one to refer to is The H.264 Licensing Labyrinth by Tim Siglin . )
The compression efficiency debate
The viability of Theora for large - scale streaming video web sites is Google 's primary concern .
Google is committed to shipping both Ogg and H.264 support in its browser , but intends to use the latter to power its popular YouTube video site .
The direction that YouTube goes for streaming video will be enormously influential and could , by itself , play a very significant role in determining the outcome of the codec issue .
The extent to which Theora lags behind H.264 is often overstated and the codec is , in actuality , in better shape than is generally thought by many of its critics .
Google open source programs manager Chris DiBona is skeptical , however , and articulated the search giant 's concerns about Theora 's compression efficiency during the debate on the WHATWG mailing list .
" If [ YouTube ] were to switch to Theora and maintain even a semblance of the current YouTube quality it would take up most available bandwidth across the internet , " DiBona said .
" The most recent public number was just over 1 billion video streams a day , and I 've seen what we 've had to do to make that happen , and it is a staggering amount of bandwidth . "
DiBona 's quality claim was broadly disputed by Theora supporters on the mailing list .
Mozilla 's Mike Shaver encouraged DiBona to examine the most recent Theora developments , suggesting that the latest improvements have helped to significantly close the gap in compression efficiency .
" I do n't think the bandwidth delta is very much with recent ( and format - compatible ) improvements to the Theora encoders , " he wrote .
" [ Codec improvements ] are a big part of what we 've been funding , and the results have been great already .
I 'd like to demonstrate them to you , because I suspect that you'd be a better - armed advocate within Google for unencumbered video if you could see what it 's really capable of now . "
Xiph's Gregory Maxwell responded to DiBona 's mailing list post by publishing a comparison that aims to demonstrate Theora 's efficacy relative to H.264 in the context of YouTube - quality streaming video .
" Using a simple test case I show that Theora is competitive and even superior to some of the files that Google is distributing today on YouTube , " he wrote .
" Theora is n't the most efficient video codec available right now .
But it is by no means bad , and it is substantially better than many other widely used options .
By conventional criteria Theora is competitive .
It also has the substantial advantage of being unencumbered , reasonable in computational complexity , and entirely open source .
People are often confused by the correct observation that Theora does n't provide the state of the art in bitrate vs quality , and take that to mean that Theora does poorly when in reality it does quite well . "
Ogg has several high - profile supporters , including popular video streaming site DailyMotion and the Wikimedia Foundation , the organization behind the popular Wikipedia Internet encyclopedia .
DailyMotion recently began the process of converting its video library to Ogg which it plans to deliver through the HTML 5 video element .
DailyMotion has acknowledged that its
Ogg streams have some technical deficiencies compared to its current Flash - based video streaming solution , but is confident that it 's the best approach in the long run .
The Wikimedia Foundation , which is a strong supporter of open technology and unencumbered accessibility to information , was already committed to Ogg even before the HTML 5 video element gained multiple browser implementations .
The organization is collaborating with Mozilla in the effort to boost Theora quality .
In an e-mail on the WHATWG list , Wikimedia Foundation volunteer media contact David Gerard said that the organization is also interested in helping Mozilla to raise general awareness of the advantages that unencumbered video would bring to the Internet .
" I 'd also point out that Wikimedia has vast publicity abilities in this direction , " he wrote .
" And we 're watching the progress of Theora and Dirac on a day - by - day basis , for obvious reasons .
So if you need large charitable organisations to help you with making this the obvious publicity choice for a happy Internet with cute fluffy kitties , I can tell you we 'll be right there ! "
A Fluffy Kitty summary of the codec debate
The following images demonstrate what the future of the web might look like , depending on potential outcomes of the codec debate .

I , for one , welcome our fluffy kitty overlords .
The undesirable middle - ground
A solution that seems logical on the surface is to simply expose each platform 's underlying media playback engine through the HTML 5 video element — DirectShow on Windows , GStreamer on Linux , and QTKit on Mac OS X .
This would make it possible for the browser to play any video formats that are supported natively on the user 's computer .
From a purely technical perspective , this is not an impossible problem to solve as there are already existing libraries that do this and provide a cohesive abstraction layer on top .
One prominent option is Nokia 's Phonon library .
It could also possibly be done by using the Quicktime and DirectShow plugins for GStreamer .
Mozilla strongly opposes this approach because it would heighten the risk of fragmentation .
Allowing content providers to use any codec that is available on the user 's computer might undermine the advantages of the HTML 5 media element because there would be no consistency guarantee and content would not be able to work everywhere .
That is , however , arguably the situation that already exists as a result of the impasse in the codec debate .
Conclusion
Hickson has clearly grown tired of the debate and has no interest in allowing the divisive issue to continue distracting HTML 5 stakeholders from their efforts to push forward the standard .
He takes the view that documenting a codec in the standard will achieve nothing unless the browser vendors are willing to conform with what the standard says .
Microsoft , which has no plans to implement the HTML 5 video element at all , is also still an impediment to bringing open Internet video to the masses .
It 's unfortunate that this debate is threatening to derail the adoption of standards - based Internet video solutions .
The dominant video solution today is Flash , a proprietary technology that is controlled by a single vendor and does n't perform well on Linux or Mac OS X .
There is a clear need for an open alternative , but the codec controversy could make it difficult .
My inner pessimist suspects that Microsoft will finally get around to implementing HTML 5 video at the same time that the H.264 patents expire , in roughly 2025 .

Obama 's health care drive hits Va .
Forum 's questions , some via Net , come largely filtered
ANNANDALE , Va. — President Obama warned Wednesday that the U.S. economy will " just sputter along " if the drive to overhaul the health care system fails this year , but he dodged a question about whether he would support taxing employer health benefits to help pay for it .
At a town - hall - style meeting in suburban Washington , Obama embraced a woman who said she was unemployed , uninsured and unable to get treatment for a recurrence of kidney cancer .
" You are Exhibit A " of why changes are needed , he told Debby Smith , 53 , of Appalachia , Va. , as she fought back tears .
The White House had solicited questions beforehand on YouTube , Facebook and Twitter — an effort to continue tapping the new technologies that boosted Obama 's presidential campaign last year .
He responded to three video queries submitted to YouTube and one tweet on Twitter .
The forum was live - streamed on the White House website .
Even so , the event at Northern Virginia Community College lacked the energetic free - for - all quality of the town - hall - style sessions Obama held during the campaign .
The questions posed from social media networks were selected by White House staffers , and the three people he called on from the audience all were affiliated with advocacy groups that support Obama .
White House spokesman Robert Gibbs defended the event beforehand , saying the questions posed reflected " a representative sample of the issues . "
Smith said the White House invited her to attend after she had spoken at events for Organizing for America , an Obama grass - roots operation at the Democratic National Committee .
Another questioner said he worked for Health Care for America Now , and the third identified herself as a member of the Service Employees International Union .
The questioner on Twitter asked the president whether he would support proposals to tax health care benefits provided by employers , an idea blasted during the 2008 campaign .
Senate Finance Chairman Max Baucus , D - Mont. , has suggested capping the amount of premiums that are tax - deductible to help finance the overhaul , estimated to cost $ 1 trillion or more .
" This is something that 's going to be debated in the House and the Senate , " Obama replied .
" We 're all going to have to weigh in on it . "
He did n't signal whether he would be willing to support curbing the tax break now .
On a GOP blog , two Republican National Committee staffers wrote a running commentary disputing the president 's words .
" Obama says our economy is in crisis because of health care costs , " Matt Moon blogged , " but his government - run plan will make it even worse , putting our country further into debt . "
The rain band near the equator that determines the supply of freshwater to nearly a billion people throughout the tropics and subtropics has been creeping north for more than 300 years , probably because of a warmer world , according to research published in the July issue of Nature Geoscience .
If the band continues to migrate at just less than a mile ( 1.4 kilometers ) a year , which is the average for all the years it has been moving north , then some Pacific islands near the equator – even those that currently enjoy abundant rainfall – may be drier within decades and starved of freshwater by midcentury or sooner .
The prospect of additional warming because of greenhouse gases means that situation could happen even sooner .
The findings suggest " that increasing greenhouse gases could potentially shift the primary band of precipitation in the tropics with profound implications for the societies and economies that depend on it , " the article says .
" We 're talking about the most prominent rainfall feature on the planet , one that many people depend on as the source of their freshwater because there is no groundwater to speak of where they live , " says Julian Sachs , associate professor of oceanography at the University of Washington and lead author of the paper .
" In addition many other people who live in the tropics but farther afield from the Pacific could be affected because this band of rain shapes atmospheric circulation patterns throughout the world . "
The band of rainfall happens at what is called the intertropical convergence zone .
There , just north of the equator , trade winds from the northern and southern hemispheres collide at the same time heat pours into the atmosphere from the tropical sun .
Rain clouds 30,000 feet thick in places proceed to dump as much as 13 feet ( 4 meters ) of rain a year in some places .
The band stretching across the Pacific is generally between 3 degrees and 10 degrees north of the equator depending on the time of year .
It has recently been hypothesized that the intertropical convergence zone does not reside in the southern hemisphere for reasons having to do with the distribution of land masses and locations of major mountain ranges in the world , particularly the Andes mountains , that have not changed for millions of years .
The new article presents surprising evidence that the intertropical convergence zone hugged the equator some 3 ½ centuries ago during Earth 's little ice age , which lasted from 1400 to 1850 .

The authors analyzed the record of rainfall in lake and lagoon sediments from four Pacific islands at or near the equator .
One of the islands they studied , Washington Island , is about 5 degrees north of the equator .
Today it is at the southern edge of the intertropical convergence zone and receives nearly 10 feet ( 2.9 meters ) of rain a year .
But cores reveal a very different Washington Island in the past :
It was arid , especially during the little ice age .
Among other things , the scientists looked for evidence in sediment cores of salt - tolerant microbes .
On Washington Island they found that evidence in 400 - to 1,000 - year - old sediment underlying what is now a freshwater lake .
Such organisms could only have thrived if rainfall was much reduced from today 's high levels on the island .
Additional evidence for changes in rainfall were provided by ratios of hydrogen isotopes of material in the sediments that can only be explained by large changes in precipitation .
Sediment cores from Palau , which lies about 7 degrees north of the equator and in the heart of the modern convergence zone , also revealed arid conditions during the little ice age .
In contrast , the researchers present evidence that the Galapagos Islands , today an arid place on the equator in the Eastern Pacific , had a wet climate during the little ice age .

They write , " The observations of dry climates on Washington Island and Palau and a wet climate in the Galapagos between about 1420 - 1560 / 1640 provide strong evidence for an intertropical convergence zone located perennially south of Washington Island ( 5 degrees north ) during that time and perhaps until the end of the eighteenth century . "
If the zone at that time experienced seasonal variations of 7 degrees latitude , as it does today , then during some seasons it would have extended southward to at least the equator , Sachs says .
This has been inferred previously from studies of the intertropical convergence zone on or near the continents , but the new data from the Pacific Ocean region is clearer because the feature is so easy to identify there .
The remarkable southward shift in the location of the intertropical convergence zone during the little ice age cannot be explained by changes in the distribution of continents and mountain ranges because they were in the same places in the little ice age as they are now .
Instead , the co-authors point out that the Earth received less solar radiation during the little ice age , about 0.1 percent less than today , and speculate that may have caused the zone to hover closer to the equator until solar radiation picked back up .
" If the intertropical convergence zone was 550 kilometers , or 5 degrees , south of its present position as recently as 1630 , it must have migrated north at an average rate of 1.4 kilometers – just less than a mile – a year , " Sachs says .
" Were that rate to continue , the intertropical convergence zone will be 126 kilometers – or more than 75 miles – north of its current position by the latter part of this century . "
Other co-authors of the paper that went online June 28 are three of Sachs ' former postdoctoral students , Dirk Sachse at the University of Potsdam , Germany ; Rienk Smittenberg at the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology Zurich , Switzerland ; and Zhaohui Zhang at the Nanjing University , China ; as well as Stjepko Golubic of Boston University ; and David Battisti , UW professor of atmospheric sciences .

Sept. 28 , 2009  --
A California woman is being praised online as a modern - day folk hero after she led a successful one - woman boycott against one of the nation 's biggest banks over what she called an unfair interest rate hike .
Ann Minch said in a YouTube video Sept. 6 that she was starting a debtors ' revolt and refused to pay any more credit card bills after Bank of America raised her 12.99 percent interest rate to 30 percent .
In an impassioned online declaration , Minch said a victory in her fight was the proverbial first shot of a debtors ' revolution against major banking institutions who she said are abusing the U.S. middle class .
Minch said she has been a Bank of America customer for 14 years , was not over the limit on her balances and was not behind on any payments .
The video quickly went viral and , as of this report , has had more than 300,000 views .
Two weeks later , on Sept. 19 , Minch posted another YouTube video , this time claiming she was contacted by a Bank of America senior official and , after a discussion about her account and the abuses of big banks in general , the bank agreed to reduce her rate back to the original 12.99 percent .
Minch only had time to purposefully miss one payment before the bank called her , she said .
In the same video , Minch said an online statement from Bank of America showed her rate as 23.99 percent , rather than the 12.99 percent she thought she had agreed upon with the bank .
" So , I do n't know what B of A 's doing , " she said .
" I do n't know if they know if the right hand knows what the left hand is doing . "
In a statement , Bank of America appeared to confirm Minch 's story , saying that " based on additional information we received about her situation , we reached a mutually agreeable resolution . "
The bank did not divulge the new rate .
' We Still Have a War to Fight '
Regardless of how long her personal battle lasts , Minch has vowed to continue the fight .
" Just because my personal account situation has been resolved , which is a small victory ... we still have a war to fight , " she said in the Sept. 19 video .
" I will continue this march and fight for the American people to stop being abused and extorted by these globalist banks . "
Minch set up a Web site to further her cause and said she also has plans for a similar revolution against taxes .

A few readers have taken issue with this post where I linked to Jonah Lehrer 's discussion of the cognitive biases at work in the health insurance market .
I did n't mean to imply that these were the only reasons that people do n't buy insurance , cost and pre-existing condition rejection are big factors , but the issues Jonah raises are relevant when discussing one silver of the uninsured .
A typical response :
I think Jonah Lehrer may be correct that some people do n't buy health insurance for the reasons he states .
But there are many other reasons that people do not buy health insurance .
I do have health insurance that I buy as an individual .
No group policy .
If I had diabetes , that pre-existing condition would not be covered nor anything the insurance company decided was related to diabetes , which could be almost anything .
My insurance premium would also be sky high even though that condition was not covered .
In my state , it is highly unlikely I could find an insurer to sell me a policy .
My husband was denied coverage even though perfectly healthy and NO pre-existing conditions .
So getting a policy is not as easy as he may think .
Another reader :
I 'm wonder if Jonah would shell out $ 90 K for a cochlear implant .
It 's my heart 's desire but my deafness is a pre-existing condition that * no * insurance company will cover short of a several thousand dollar monthly premium .
I 'm otherwise completely healthy and an implant would put me back in the work force for the first time in eighteen years .
How do you buy insurance when you do n't have a job ?
I 'm not old enough for Medicare and I 've been denied SSI ** twice ** on the premise that I 'm able to work .
How do you get a job that does n't require the ability to hear ?
After handing out 170 resumes over the past decade , all I know is that once an employer knows you may have two college degrees but you can't answer the goddamn phone .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Atheist Eoban Binder appeared on Fox & Friends this morning to talk about the Indiana Atheist Bus Campaign ’s recent victory !
Eoban handled himself well , especially considering I wanted to scream when either Steve Doocy or Pastor Tony Taylor said anything .
Recall the ad in question :
What was Taylor ’s response to it ?
“ I feel it ’s an outright attack on Christianity .
I feel like the language of it is inflammatory …
I think that this is just an agenda trying to get passed by the Left . ”
Wow .
Taylor would probably have had a heart attack if he saw the more popular atheist bus ad :
Doocy ’s criticism is that the ad mentions the word “ God ” :
Mr. Binder , you know , if you ’re anti— if you ’re not religious , you do n’t believe in God , yet you put “ You Can Be Good Without God ” in your message , why did n’t you have more of an atheist message , like , “ You Can Feel Good About Yourself ” or something like that .
Why did you have to include God ?
Would someone please explain to me how “ You Can Feel Good About Yourself ” is a more atheist - ical message than the current ad ?
Eoban did send a message to FOXNews earlier today to correct a few mistakes that Taylor made :
The Constitution , and therefore the Bill of Rights , does have legal standing , but God is not mentioned in it .
Therefore , the entire premise of Mr Taylor ’s argument is false .
Given that our campaign surely has many detractors as it does supporters , I was disappointed that Fox News was unable to find a guest who was capable of delivering any kind of remotely sensible argument against our campaign , but then again , I suppose I could have been expecting too much anyhow .
All the same , thank you for having me on your show .
I ’d like to think they read it but I ’m not holding my breath .
DETROIT  Believe it or not , General Motors has a hit car on its hands .
Amid the gloom of bankruptcy and a miserable market for new vehicles , G.M. ’s new Chevrolet Camaro muscle car is winning over consumers looking for a little excitement in a bland landscape of look - alike sedans and watered - down sport utilities .
G.M. sold 9,300 Camaros during the month of June  more than either its entire Buick or Cadillac divisions could muster on their own .
And with G.M. expected to emerge Friday from bankruptcy as a newly constituted company , it is hardly surprising that the Camaro will play a starring role in the company ’s coming - out party and news conference at G.M. ’s Detroit headquarters .
G.M. ’s chief executive , Fritz Henderson , and new chairman , Edward Whitacre , plan to offer the Camaro as proof that a comeback is under way .

If illegally copying music files does n't annoy the RIAA enough , P2P leaks of pre-release albums are enough to send content owners into a blind rage .
The industry seems to consider pre-release albums to be worth much more than they are after their release , and when law enforcement manages to catch a few of those responsible for the leaks , they go to town .
Such is the case with four members of piracy group Rabid Neurosis ( or RNS , for short ) who were indicted this week for conspiracy to commit copyright infringement .
The group was allegedly led by 29 - year - old Adil R. Cassim and spent the better part of a decade ( 1999 to " at least " 2007 ) illegally distributing copyrighted songs online .
According to the indictment , RNS made a name for itself for being a " pre-release group " or a " first provider , " meaning that members were able to provide copies of songs and albums before commercial release in the US .
" The supply of pre-release music was often provided by music industry insiders , such as employees of compact disc manufacturing plants , radio stations , and retailers , who typically receive advance copies of music prior to its commercial release , " read the court documents .
Because there was competition between piracy groups to see who could get unreleased albums up faster , RNS tagged its offerings so that everyone downloading them could see where they came from .
This , of course , also means that law enforcement has been able to see how many albums have RNS ' fingerprints all over them .
The US Department of Justice does n't specify exactly how many songs the four individuals are responsible for distributing , but refers to them in the " thousands " in the indictment , saying that they include the works of Jay - Z , Eminem , Us , and Fallout Boy .
The group apparently conspired by assigning different members to different tasks , such as obtaining the works , ripping , encoding , and managing servers , among other things .
The four face five years in prison each and a fine of $ 250,000 , as well as three years of supervised release .
Additionally , two others involved with RNS have been charged , with one already pleading guilty to conspiracy to commit copyright infringement earlier this week and the other facing sentencing on December 4 .
A quick search online shows that RNS quit putting albums online ( at least under that name ) in January of 2007 , so the group has been out of commission for awhile .
Those who upload pre-releases may want to consider covering their tracks a little bit better if they want to keep up their pirating ways .

The Iranian Islamic Republic News Agency reports that Muslims in Germany have decided to take offence to the official club song of a Bundesliga football team .
The Central Council of Muslims has deemed that a verse in FC Schalke 04’s “ Blau und Weiß , wie lieb ich Dich ” ( Blue and White , How I love you ) “ did not show sufficient respect towards Prophet Mohammad ( PBUH ) . ”
Here is the verse :
Mohammed war ein Prophet
Der vom Fußballspielen nichts versteht
Doch aus all der schönen Farbenpracht
Hat er sich das Blau und Weiße ausgedacht
Which the club ’s site helpfully translates , with “ no claim to lyrical accuracy , ”
Mohammed was a prophet who
Knew nothing of football , that much is true
But of all the colours shining bright
The ones he thought up were our royal blue and white
Muslim fans of the team have threatened a boycott unless the verse is changed , and , according to the IRNA , the club is taking them seriously .
It plans to hire an “ Islamic expert ” in investigate charges of blasphemy .
The song was written in 1924 .
Who says Muslims are quick to take offence ?
( Hat tip : Islam in Europe )
UPDATE : ( 14:45 ) Earth Times has more quotes , and the allegation that “ threats have been expressed on various internet forums . ”
A club spokesman says they have received about 350 emails :
We are taking the situation very seriously and are in contact with police and state protection institutions .
Burhan Kesici , general secretary of the Islamic Council in Germany , told the Turkish language service of the GPA :
It is not right that the prophet is mentioned in a club anthem .
I would wish that out of respect for the Muslims in this country the Mohammed - stanza is not sung .
Earth Times suggests that the reason German Muslims have taken 95 years to be offended by the club ’s song is that they have become “ more sensitive ” since the murder of an Egyptian woman by a racist in a Dresden courtroom .
The general secretary of the Central Council of Muslims in Germany , Aiman Mazy , believes “ many Muslims do n’t feel secure any more ” after the incident .
So , naturally , they react by being more vocally intolerant and demanding of respect .
Good thinking , German Muslims .
Contemporary Woman leaves few good deeds unpunished .
Not that She would regard my last column as such , but She did show up in sizable numbers to savage me for it .
There were a few sisterly waves of support , but the tide of condescending cattiness flowed from all across the spectrum , both left and right as I would have predicted .
Many of my conservative male friends ( who know few women well beyond their wives ) assume that fiscally conservative women are also socially conservative in their personal lives .
You ’d have thought the Tanya Tuckers , Sandi Pattys , Amy Grants , Bo Dereks , and Shannen Dohertys would have taught them something by now .
Even Ann Coulter noted the recent promiscuity that has overtaken ostensibly conservative Beltway women .
On Judith Regan Tonight on Fox News she confessed to being shocked when , at a small gathering of couples , the women confessed that they would have had sex on the first date but did n’t initiate it because they thought the men wanted to wait .
This means that in some circles the continued shift in sexual tendencies has now made men the prudes .
How unbelievably depressing .
( On the amusing side there is Shannen Doherty .
She ’s now been booted off two television shows [ 90210 and Charmed ] for prima donna grandstanding and a nasty attitude .
She answers few calls these days because she thinks she ’s still a huge star , forgetting that her last show was a brainless stinker on the WB channel .
After being fired from 90210 she had taken to changing men like underclothing and even threatening some of them with a .38 revolver [ poor Judd Nelson was one of these . ]
It ’s a mystery to me why she attended the Republican National Convention in 1992 , given the flack she ’d take in Hollywood for doing so .
Maybe she was denied a right - to - carry permit for her .38 revolver and was angry about it ! )
What I wrote last month never elicits any objection in countless off - the - record conversations I ’ve had with women .
It seems my capital crime was to air the sisterhood ’s dirty laundry in a mixed venue where many male eyes saw it and voiced agreement .
Reeeeoowww !
Out came the cat claws !
I so detest hypocritical victimology , and this reminded me so much of the " principled " black people who refer to each other with the N - word like it is going out of style , and then flare their nostrils in umbrage the instant a white person uses the epithet .
( It ’s a measure of how far political correctness has gained ground in our culture that men who make even playful , joking generalizations about women are quickly savaged by women ( if not men first ) for " sexism " and " misogyny . "
And yet I hear women constantly make the ugliest , broad - brush generalizations about men [ either in front of them or behind closed doors ] and yet it ’s seldom that either men or women will speak up to challenge them .
This is exactly why sexual and racial hypocrisies and the double standards that emanate from them will get worse before getting better , guys . )
The dominant theme of the Angry White Females ( after perfunctorily admitting that maybe a few women long , long ago in a galaxy far , far away made some mistakes ) is that it ’s all men ’s fault , it ’s all men ’s fault , it ’s all men ’s fault .
And there were confused gems like this :
How can you say that women like guys who cheat ?!!
When did this sudden change come about ?
Is n’t the problem really one of men having less and less class ?
Your characterization of yuppie men as being perfect , reliable creatures was laughable .
As if these darlings would never think of cheating .
If you wanted to be helpful to women you should have stressed that marriage requires commitment ( which men can seldom seem to muster these days ) and hard work on the part of both spouses .
Re-read my article , dear .
You better believe women will tolerate ( though not necessarily accept ) cheating if it ’s part of their Pygmalion project ; i.e. , if it ’s one more shortcoming from which they ’re going to redeem the jerk .
This was no generational change .
Women have pursued jerks since time immemorial .
They ’ve catered to them , had their babies , cleaned their homes , cooked their dinners , and wasted decades of their lives with them .
And then one day they suddenly decide they ’ve Finally Had Enough ! and ( flying to the other extreme ) join the Rosie O’Donnell Resentful Dike & Bitter Soccer Mom Brigade .
( On so many relational fronts many women so seldom ever find the rational middle ground . )
My point was precisely that jerks come in all varieties and women will probably never tire of pursuing them .
They provide a real life soap - opera drama of tension , mind games , and histrionics that women seem to be hopelessly addicted to .
On marriage , my article was n’t on the subject per se .
( I ’ve noticed that it ’s become an all - too - familiar tactic to pick a topic that I did n’t write about and then criticize me for not covering it . )
Here ’s another gem from a self - described conservative woman :
Such a childish rant .
You do n’t come close to what the real problem is , the caustic consumer capitalism that is eating away at our lives and relationships .
Of course that ’s the last issue anything written on LewRockwell.com would ever explore .
In an online discussion I ’ve been following it was pointed out that even Allan Bloom said that women have it much worse than men in today ’s relationships .
I ’d recommend you read him , but I ’m sure he ’d be above your level .
Consumer capitalism ?!
Wow , I guess we gals just never had it so good as those women of the Brezhnev era .
Bring back the old Soviet Union !
I have read some of Allan Bloom ’s material and have difficulty believing that he made such a carelessly subjective assertion as you ’ve stated it ( though wonders never cease ) .
There are certainly men who exploit women .
There are also women who exploit men ; just because this is an unspeakable truth in the omnipresent culture of female victimology promulgated on daytime TV , in major newspapers , in women ’s magazines , and in college humanities departments does n’t mean it does n’t happen .
Talk to the 50 - year - old physician I know whose wife left him some years ago for a 26 - year - old pro tennis player she met at a country club .
How long will a 26 - year - old tennis player stay with a 49 - year - old woman after her divorce settlement money runs out ?
Try 2 months .
Suffice to say the Doc did n’t take her back .
Now for the men : I ’ve been in the ministry for 20 years and can tell you that pursuing jerks is definitely alive and well even among evangelical Christian women .
They marry outside the faith about 6 times the rate of men because they think it ’s their will ( not God ’s ) to not only civilize the men but convert them to Christianity as well .
No amount of reasoning will sway them .
The end result is yet more broken families that the church has to take care of .
Hence most 30s Christian singles classes are composed of 5 - 7 never - been - married men and 15 divorced women , a complete incompatibility .
The women usually end up leaving after I point out that the New Testament ( Matt 19:9 , 1 Cor 7:10 - 11 ) forbids re-marriage for anyone divorced for a reason other than adultery and state that I have every intention of honoring this command .
The wonderful result is that they burden liberal churches with the fallout of their past misadventures while I ’m able to use my limited resources to preach the Word of God to people who are really interested in what it says .
Good for you .
You can take comfort in the fact that things are n’t much better on the Catholic side of the fence either .
It amazes me how ministers , priests , and rabbis  the very people who God ordained to protect marriage against the perversions of a secular culture  have willingly participated in the institution ’s complete bastardization .
( Tonight  6/24/01  I ’m watching Fox News ’
Only on Fox where a female minister in Seattle is actually holding ceremonies that have the look and feel of a wedding , but are for couples celebrating their divorce !
At the end of the ceremony the parents , children , and minister all gather in a circle for one big " hug-in . "
How thoroughly twisted . )
A truly Christian society where everyone ( outside of infidelity and death of a spouse ) had one and only one shot at marriage surely would n’t be perfect , but would definitely force people to choose their mates much more carefully .
In post -Christian America , where Elizabeth Taylor gets married and divorced 8 times , the institution of marriage is a long - running joke from which either spouse can easily bail .
Unlike most of today ’s brides , though , at least Liz Taylor had the class not to wear a white gown after the first marriage .
I ’m 31 , single , and never - been married .
In college women would n’t give me the time of day .
Now that I ’m a securities analyst with a new Z3 convertible , the " twice divorced , with children , and half their looks gone " women my age are suddenly coming from every direction with compliments about my " wonderful personality . "
They seem to be using a variant of the tactics " the jerks " used to successfully bait and plunder them .
Then there ’s the second group with the same traits as the first , but for reasons I can’t fathom , is out looking for movie stars ( as if the Brad Pitts would ever be interested in them ) .
What ’s going on there ?
Denial of reality .
When the grandparents finally tire of providing free babysitting and child support does n’t cover a growing list of " necessities " for her children ( cell phones , Pokemon cards , Playstation II ) , then she ’ll hold her nose and " hit up the nerds . "
The disingenuous compliments on your personality are a delicious irony .
In the 1970 ’s , when a man complimented a woman on her looks it became fashionable for the woman to retort , " What about my brain , you pig ? ! "
I ’d love to see once - spurned men like you and my brothers answer these women with the retort , " What about my looks , you money - grubbing freak ? ! "
Then , if you ’re in a public place , pour a drink over her head and shriek , " You just DON ’T get it , do you ? ! " and leave in a supremely self - righteous huff .
I ’m convinced that if women were the tit - for - tat recipients of just half of the petty , prima donna antics they dish out to men , there would be a seismic shift in today ’s relationships .
Most men today are just too kowtowed and addicted to sex to ever take a principled stand on anything for long .
They ’re putty in the hands of women wielding the threat of sexual deprivation .
As I just mentioned , two of my brothers are currently navigating through the Hades of never - been - married thirties singlehood .
They ’re tall , handsome , incredibly sweet Italian - American men ( nothing like the ugly stereotypes on The Sopranos ) with graduate degrees and good jobs .
They ’re also good Catholics who take seriously the Church ’s imperatives about living a clean and moral life .
Yet none of these qualities comes even close to satisfying the turned - up tastes of Contemporary Woman .
Thankfully my brothers are now starting to see the reality that what they ’re really missing out on are some very bad things indeed .
This was made evident by recent wire reports highlighting a study from the May 2001 issue of the American Journal of Epidemiology .
The study reported that the annual number of Americans with HSV - 2 ( genital herpes ) skyrocketed 82 % from 1970 to 1985 with the sharpest gains among women and twenty - somethings .
Women had higher rates of infection than men ( 9.9 per 1,000 versus 6.9 for men ) and among men and women in their twenties , women outpaced men by a substantial amount ( 22.5 per 1,000 versus 14.6 for men ) .
The study also found that a steadily increasing fraction of women were infected during pregnancy putting their infants at risk for neonatal herpes which can cause permanent brain damage in surviving infants .
Although the transmission process makes HSV - 2 easier for women to catch than men , there ’s also no doubt that women ’s increased willingness to embrace the promiscuous lifestyle is also a factor given the huge increase in the annual rate of infections .
One problem with the study is its sample period ending in 1985 .
To call this study a lagging indicator is to make a heck of an understatement , although no one with a straight face could plausibly claim that in the past 16 years sexual standards have become stricter , plenty of evidence suggests just the opposite .
The study ’s authors voice their doubts as well , citing another study showing increases in HSV - 2 antibodies in the early 1990s .
They provide the mind - blowing estimate that 35 - 50 % of college students are infected with HSV - 2 with 80 % of the infected group not even knowing it !!
None of this even gets at the already - well known correlations between increased risks of cervical cancer and women who have had sex in their teens , three or more sex partners , and sex with males who have had multiple partners .
Other dandy jewels making the rounds among Spring Break bed hoppers are HPV ( genital warts ) and Hepatitis C ( which frequently destroys the liver causing its victims to need a transplant ) .
Despite the worsening dangers , the majority of dating women today persist in behaving like little more than prostitutes .
In fact they ’re worse since ( according to police reports ) prostitutes are now usually earning at least $ 150 per customer for intercourse .
The average dating woman today puts out for dinner and a movie that are n’t even worth a third that much .
And yet popular culture steadily pushes the envelope to ever - lower lows : MTV’s Spring Break , Sex and the City , That 70s Show , not to mention the loads of trashy soaps on daytime TV .
E-mailers like the woman above can blame " consumer capitalism " all they want , but the beauty of capitalism is that it reflects what people actually value , not what they dishonestly say they value .
In that sense it ’s a brutally honest system .
To pretend that men and women were any less shallow and materialistic under communism displays an astounding ignorance of human nature .
Just because the poverty of communism effectively suppressed outward manifestations of materialistic preferences and tendencies hardly means they did n’t exist .
It was a system that , while hypocritically championing women ’s rights , was dominated by men who used draconian political power to procure for themselves the best goods and the most attractive women .
If socially conservative women now think that socialism is the answer to the current problems between the sexes , I ’m afraid the situation is much worse than I ever thought .
As I said before and will say again ( and women will agree with me as long as it ’s off the record ) , women hold far greater potential power in relationships because their consent makes possible every crucial juncture , from the first date , to engagement , to the wedding day .
Female consent also controls the timing of these events as well as the nature of the man with which the woman chooses to spend her life .
Yet this phenomenal power is continually used in such an irresponsible way and the end results are either a blanket hatred of men or a perplexity as to why they " wo n’t commit . "
This latter point is endlessly examined in supermarket checkout line magazines such as Cosmopolitan , Vogue , Glamour , and Bazaar which print articles every month trying to unlock " the mystery " of why men wo n’t commit to women and what to do about it .
The articles are typically written by career women who have had few , if any , long - term relationships themselves .
Hence the advice is that women are always just one makeover , one sexy outfit , one new " in " hairstyle away for snagging their forever beau .
The magazines sell well despite the fact that the advice never works .
Today marriage is increasingly seen as a bad deal for responsible men like my brothers who spent their 20s earning degrees and building their careers as opposed to participating in Spring Break orgies .
Sold on the lie that most women desired stable , faithful providers , they have no interest in trading away their standard of living for psychological baggage and numerous financial burdens not of their own making .
Why would anyone be flattered to be someone else ’s last resort ?
As far as the jerks go , men who get the benefits of marriage without marriage do n’t find marriage very appealing .
It ’s not much more complicated than that .
If women are really interested in getting men to commit , for starters they should put their pants back on .

BBC News , Calais
Trade in Calais has been slow , but the booze cruise may not yet be dead .
A combination of weak sterling and the recession , keeping consumers at home and pushing shops to cut prices , has made a trip to the cash - and - carry across the English Channel seem uneconomical .
Eighteen months ago , the pound was worth just over 1.40 euros .
But today you will get little more than 1.12 euros , making the booze cruise 28 % more expensive for Brits .
Customers have kept away , shop floors are run down to basic stock .
Many French alcohol retailers in the port have cut opening hours and some have closed down .
David West , owner of Eastenders cash and carry , says sales have slumped dramatically .
" It 's not just the euro , the recession does not help , " he says , " but I 'm hopeful that the UK and France will pull out of the recession .
Business is business , I just try to stay optimistic . "
Quantity pays
But filling your boot with burgundy may be worth the trek - if you buy in bulk .
On a sample shopping basket , including a couple of cases of red and white wine , premium lager and three litres of brand spirits , would cost upwards of £ 220 in leading UK supermarkets .
The Stone family find French alcohol prices too high
But the equivalent items cost just over £ 150 in France : a total saving of £ 70 .
Given that a round - trip from London to Calais costs about £ 38 in fuel and a day return for a car and passengers on a ferry can cost as little as £ 35 , spending any more than £ 150 in France would make the journey worthwhile .
David Mosely , a shopper on his way to Calais , says the choice and quality of produce in French cash - and - carry markets is much better , and buying boxes , rather than the odd bottle , makes sense .
" There is a lot of good value certainly around Calais and the wine markets , " he adds .
" And certain brands you can buy in Britain , you can pick up six bottles for the price that you pay for two in Britain .
Four bottles for free ?
Sounds good to me . "
Sceptical shoppers
But not all shoppers are convinced .
Mandy and David Stone , who are taking their two children on a camping holiday , say they will probably not stock up on the way home .
" It probably does n't have the appeal that it once did .
With the weak pound , it would n't be very good value . "
Similarly , Stacey and Richard Parker , on their way to recharge their batteries in France , reckon there are better bargains in Britain .
David
West has seen sterling 's value decline for 20 years " We may bring a couple of bottles back , but I do n't think it 's worth it from a financial point of view , " says Stacey .
" I think the choice that you have in England now is such that you do n't need to bother . "
Even the ferries have noted a change in customer habits .
The number of day passengers on P&O ferries has been in steady decline for years , from more than 125,000 in 2005 to fewer than 95,000 last year .
" The day - tripper market is nothing like it was .
The main reason for coming now is short breaks and holidays , " says Brian Rees , head of public relations at P&O .
But the ferry operator notes that total travel - including families staying longer , coach trips and freight - was up from 4.6 million in August 2008 to 4.75 million this year .
" The money does not get so densely spent in the Calais area any more , but now it is being diluted across the whole region .
The heyday of the booze cruise was about 10 years ago and the day - tripper market will continue to decline . "
P&O is now even offering a service for passengers to load up on the ferry itself , offering a discounted ticket to drivers who park up , load up and return straight to the UK .

More ask to carry concealed weapons
Political , economic fears drive increase
Gun owners are packing heat in record numbers , fearful of stricter gun control under the Obama administration and higher crime in a sour economy .
Some states and counties report a surge in applications for concealed weapons permits since the November election .
All states but Illinois and Wisconsin allow concealed weapons , but requirements differ .
Applications already have hit a record this year in Clay County , Mo. , where the sheriff 's office received 888 through June , compared with 863 in all of last year , Sheriff Bob Boydston says .
In the past , applicants tended to be middle - aged men , he says , but now include " grandmothers , older folks , young women , young men . "
They tell him the bad economy will lead to more thefts and break - ins , he says , but his statistics show recession - related violent crime has n't gone up .
They also fear gun control , he says .
Last week , an elderly couple seeking a permit told him they were sure the president was " on the verge of coming to our homes and taking our weapons , " he says .
Statewide , the Missouri State Highway Patrol has processed 18,878 background checks this year for the permits , the most since the agency began keeping statistics in 2005 , Lt. John Hotz says .
In May , Obama signed a law that will allow guns in national parks .
" The president respects and supports the Second Amendment and the tradition of gun ownership in this country , " White House spokesman Ben LaBolt says .
Interest groups on both sides agree that demand is up because of economic and political uncertainty .
People worry the administration and the Democratic - controlled Congress will try to " enact more gun control , " says Andrew Arulanandam , spokesman for the National Rifle Association .
Paul Helmke , president of the Brady Campaign to Prevent Gun Violence , fears that violent confrontations will increase .
" When someone 's carrying a gun around and they 're not fully trained , oftentimes they 'll use it just because it 's there , " he says .
Demand is also up in :
• Florida .
The Department of Agriculture and Consumer Services hired 61 temporary workers to tackle a backlog in applications , spokesman Terence McElroy says .
It got 75,520 applications through June , on pace to beat last year 's record of 90,331 .
• Caldwell County , N.C. Residents filed 358 applications in the first half of this year , compared with 135 for the same period last year , " a bigger increase than we 've ever seen , " Sheriff 's Detective B.J.
Fore says .
" People are worried about desperate times . "
• Utah .
June ranked as the top month ever for applications , with 11,292 received , says Lt. Doug Anderson of the state Bureau of Criminal Identification .
The year also is on pace to be record - setting , he says , with 49,499 applications in through June .
Craig Ball , manager of Impact Guns in Ogden , has offered more training courses .
" Last year , a typical class would be 15 to 20 people , " he says .
" Right after the election , we had as many as 55 . "

* Photo : Nick Veasey * Merck was in trouble .
In 2002 , the pharmaceutical giant was falling behind its rivals in sales .
Even worse , patents on five blockbuster drugs were about to expire , which would allow cheaper generics to flood the market .
The company had n't introduced a truly new product in three years , and its stock price was plummeting .
In interviews with the press , Edward Scolnick , Merck 's research director , laid out his battle plan to restore the firm to preeminence .
Key to his strategy was expanding the company 's reach into the antidepressant market , where Merck had lagged while competitors like Pfizer and GlaxoSmithKline created some of the best - selling drugs in the world .
" To remain dominant in the future , " he told Forbes , " we need to dominate the central nervous system . "
His plan hinged on the success of an experimental antidepressant codenamed MK - 869 .
Still in clinical trials , it looked like every pharma executive 's dream : a new kind of medication that exploited brain chemistry in innovative ways to promote feelings of well - being .
The drug tested brilliantly early on , with minimal side effects , and Merck touted its game - changing potential at a meeting of 300 securities analysts .
Behind the scenes , however , MK - 869 was starting to unravel .
True , many test subjects treated with the medication felt their hopelessness and anxiety lift .
But so did nearly the same number who took a placebo , a look - alike pill made of milk sugar or another inert substance given to groups of volunteers in clinical trials to gauge how much more effective the real drug is by comparison .
The fact that taking a faux drug can powerfully improve some people 's health — the so - called placebo effect — has long been considered an embarrassment to the serious practice of pharmacology .
Ultimately , Merck 's foray into the antidepressant market failed .
In subsequent tests , MK - 869 turned out to be no more effective than a placebo .
In the jargon of the industry , the trials crossed the futility boundary .
MK - 869 was n't the only highly anticipated medical breakthrough to be undone in recent years by the placebo effect .
From 2001 to 2006 , the percentage of new products cut from development after Phase II clinical trials , when drugs are first tested against placebo , rose by 20 percent .
The failure rate in more extensive Phase III trials increased by 11 percent , mainly due to surprisingly poor showings against placebo .
Despite historic levels of industry investment in R&D , the US Food and Drug Administration approved only 19 first - of - their - kind remedies in 2007 — the fewest since 1983 — and just 24 in 2008 .
Half of all drugs that fail in late - stage trials drop out of the pipeline due to their inability to beat sugar pills .
The upshot is fewer new medicines available to ailing patients and more financial woes for the beleaguered pharmaceutical industry .
Last November , a new type of gene therapy for Parkinson 's disease , championed by the Michael J. Fox Foundation , was abruptly withdrawn from Phase II trials after unexpectedly tanking against placebo .
A stem - cell startup called Osiris Therapeutics got a drubbing on Wall Street in March , when it suspended trials of its pill for Crohn 's disease , an intestinal ailment , citing an " unusually high " response to placebo .
Two days later , Eli Lilly broke off testing of a much - touted new drug for schizophrenia when volunteers showed double the expected level of placebo response .
It 's not only trials of new drugs that are crossing the futility boundary .
Some products that have been on the market for decades , like Prozac , are faltering in more recent follow - up tests .
In many cases , these are the compounds that , in the late '90s , made Big Pharma more profitable than Big Oil .
But if these same drugs were vetted now , the FDA might not approve some of them .
Two comprehensive analyses of antidepressant trials have uncovered a dramatic increase in placebo response since the 1980s .
One estimated that the so - called effect size ( a measure of statistical significance ) in placebo groups had nearly doubled over that time .
It 's not that the old meds are getting weaker , drug developers say .
It 's as if the placebo effect is somehow getting stronger .
The fact that an increasing number of medications are unable to beat sugar pills has thrown the industry into crisis .
The stakes could hardly be higher .
In today 's economy , the fate of a long - established company can hang on the outcome of a handful of tests .
Why are inert pills suddenly overwhelming promising new drugs and established medicines alike ?
The reasons are only just beginning to be understood .
A network of independent researchers is doggedly uncovering the inner workings — and potential therapeutic applications — of the placebo effect .
At the same time , drugmakers are realizing they need to fully understand the mechanisms behind it so they can design trials that differentiate more clearly between the beneficial effects of their products and the body 's innate ability to heal itself .
A special task force of the Foundation for the National Institutes of Health is seeking to stem the crisis by quietly undertaking one of the most ambitious data - sharing efforts in the history of the drug industry .
After decades in the jungles of fringe science , the placebo effect has become the elephant in the boardroom .
The roots of the placebo problem can be traced to a lie told by an Army nurse during World War II as Allied forces stormed the beaches of southern Italy .
The nurse was assisting an anesthetist named Henry Beecher , who was tending to US troops under heavy German bombardment .
When the morphine supply ran low , the nurse assured a wounded soldier that he was getting a shot of potent painkiller , though her syringe contained only salt water .
Amazingly , the bogus injection relieved the soldier 's agony and prevented the onset of shock .
Returning to his post at Harvard after the war , Beecher became one of the nation 's leading medical reformers .
Inspired by the nurse 's healing act of deception , he launched a crusade to promote a method of testing new medicines to find out whether they were truly effective .
At the time , the process for vetting drugs was sloppy at best : Pharmaceutical companies would simply dose volunteers with an experimental agent until the side effects swamped the presumed benefits .
Beecher proposed that if test subjects could be compared to a group that received a placebo , health officials would finally have an impartial way to determine whether a medicine was actually responsible for making a patient better .
In a 1955 paper titled " The Powerful Placebo , " published in The Journal of the American Medical Association , Beecher described how the placebo effect had undermined the results of more than a dozen trials by causing improvement that was mistakenly attributed to the drugs being tested .
He demonstrated that trial volunteers who got real medication were also subject to placebo effects ; the act of taking a pill was itself somehow therapeutic , boosting the curative power of the medicine .
Only by subtracting the improvement in a placebo control group could the actual value of the drug be calculated .
The article caused a sensation .
By 1962 , reeling from news of birth defects caused by a drug called thalidomide , Congress amended the Food , Drug , and Cosmetic Act , requiring trials to include enhanced safety testing and placebo control groups .
Volunteers would be assigned randomly to receive either medicine or a sugar pill , and neither doctor nor patient would know the difference until the trial was over .
Beecher 's double - blind , placebo - controlled , randomized clinical trial — or RCT — was enshrined as the gold standard of the emerging pharmaceutical industry .
Today , to win FDA approval , a new medication must beat placebo in at least two authenticated trials .
Beecher 's prescription helped cure the medical establishment of outright quackery , but it had an insidious side effect .
By casting placebo as the villain in RCTs , he ended up stigmatizing one of his most important discoveries .
The fact that even dummy capsules can kick - start the body 's recovery engine became a problem for drug developers to overcome , rather than a phenomenon that could guide doctors toward a better understanding of the healing process and how to drive it most effectively .
In his eagerness to promote his template for clinical trials , Beecher also overreached by seeing the placebo effect at work in curing ailments like the common cold , which wane with no intervention at all .
But the triumph of Beecher 's gold standard was a generation of safer medications that worked for nearly everyone .
Anthracyclines do n't require an oncologist with a genial bedside manner to slow the growth of tumors .
What Beecher did n't foresee , however , was the explosive growth of the pharmaceutical industry .
The blockbuster success of mood drugs in the ' 80s and '90s emboldened Big Pharma to promote remedies for a growing panoply of disorders that are intimately related to higher brain function .
By attempting to dominate the central nervous system , Big Pharma gambled its future on treating ailments that have turned out to be particularly susceptible to the placebo effect .
The tall , rusty - haired son of a country doctor , William Potter , 64 , has spent most of his life treating mental illness — first as a psychiatrist at the National Institute of Mental Health and then as a drug developer .
A decade ago , he took a job at Lilly 's neuroscience labs .
There , working on new antidepressants and antianxiety meds , he became one of the first researchers to glimpse the approaching storm .
To test products internally , pharmaceutical companies routinely run trials in which a long - established medication and an experimental one compete against each other as well as against a placebo .
As head of Lilly 's early - stage psychiatric drug development in the late '90s , Potter saw that even durable warhorses like Prozac , which had been on the market for years , were being overtaken by dummy pills in more recent tests .
The company 's next - generation antidepressants were faring badly , too , doing no better than placebo in seven out of 10 trials .
As a psychiatrist , Potter knew that some patients really do seem to get healthier for reasons that have more to do with a doctor 's empathy than with the contents of a pill .
But it baffled him that drugs he'd been prescribing for years seemed to be struggling to prove their effectiveness .
Thinking that something crucial may have been overlooked , Potter tapped an IT geek named David DeBrota to help him comb through the Lilly database of published and unpublished trials — including those that the company had kept secret because of high placebo response .
They aggregated the findings from decades of antidepressant trials , looking for patterns and trying to see what was changing over time .
What they found challenged some of the industry 's basic assumptions about its drug-vetting process .
Assumption number one was that if a trial were managed correctly , a medication would perform as well or badly in a Phoenix hospital as in a Bangalore clinic .
Potter discovered , however , that geographic location alone could determine whether a drug bested placebo or crossed the futility boundary .
By the late '90s , for example , the classic antianxiety drug diazepam ( also known as Valium ) was still beating placebo in France and Belgium .
But when the drug was tested in the US , it was likely to fail .
Conversely , Prozac performed better in America than it did in western Europe and South Africa .
It was an unsettling prospect : FDA approval could hinge on where the company chose to conduct a trial .
Mistaken assumption number two was that the standard tests used to gauge volunteers ' improvement in trials yielded consistent results .
Potter and his colleagues discovered that ratings by trial observers varied significantly from one testing site to another .
It was like finding out that the judges in a tight race each had a different idea about the placement of the finish line .
Potter and DeBrota 's data - mining also revealed that even superbly managed trials were subject to runaway placebo effects .
But exactly why any of this was happening remained elusive .
" We were able to identify many of the core issues in play , " Potter says .
" But there was no clear answer to the problem . "
Convinced that what Lilly was facing was too complex for any one pharmaceutical house to unravel on its own , he came up with a plan to break down the firewalls between researchers across the industry , enabling them to share data in " pre-competitive space . "
After prodding by Potter and others , the NIH focused on the issue in 2000 , hosting a three - day conference in Washington .
For the first time in medical history , more than 500 drug developers , doctors , academics , and trial designers put their heads together to examine the role of the placebo effect in clinical trials and healing in general .
Potter 's ambitious plan for a collaborative approach to the problem eventually ran into its own futility boundary :
No one would pay for it .
And drug companies do n't share data , they hoard it .
But the NIH conference launched a new wave of placebo research in academic labs in the US and Italy that would make significant progress toward solving the mystery of what was happening in clinical trials .
Visitors to Fabrizio Benedetti's clinic at the University of Turin are asked never to say the P - word around the med students who sign up for his experiments .
For all the volunteers know , the trim , soft - spoken neuroscientist is hard at work concocting analgesic skin creams and methods for enhancing athletic performance .
One recent afternoon in his lab , a young soccer player grimaced with exertion while doing leg curls on a weight machine .
Benedetti and his colleagues were exploring the potential of using Pavlovian conditioning to give athletes a competitive edge undetectable by anti-doping authorities .
A player would receive doses of a performance - enhancing drug for weeks and then a jolt of placebo just before competition .
Benedetti , 53 , first became interested in placebos in the mid-'90s , while researching pain .
He was surprised that some of the test subjects in his placebo groups seemed to suffer less than those on active drugs .
But scientific interest in this phenomenon , and the money to research it , were hard to come by .
" The placebo effect was considered little more than a nuisance , " he recalls .
" Drug companies , physicians , and clinicians were not interested in understanding its mechanisms .
They were concerned only with figuring out whether their drugs worked better . "
Part of the problem was that response to placebo was considered a psychological trait related to neurosis and gullibility rather than a physiological phenomenon that could be scrutinized in the lab and manipulated for therapeutic benefit .
But then Benedetti came across a study , done years earlier , that suggested the placebo effect had a neurological foundation .
US scientists had found that a drug called naloxone blocks the pain - relieving power of placebo treatments .
The brain produces its own analgesic compounds called opioids , released under conditions of stress , and naloxone blocks the action of these natural painkillers and their synthetic analogs .
The study gave Benedetti the lead he needed to pursue his own research while running small clinical trials for drug companies .
Now , after 15 years of experimentation , he has succeeded in mapping many of the biochemical reactions responsible for the placebo effect , uncovering a broad repertoire of self - healing responses .
Placebo - activated opioids , for example , not only relieve pain ; they also modulate heart rate and respiration .
The neurotransmitter dopamine , when released by placebo treatment , helps improve motor function in Parkinson 's patients .
Mechanisms like these can elevate mood , sharpen cognitive ability , alleviate digestive disorders , relieve insomnia , and limit the secretion of stress - related hormones like insulin and cortisol .
In one study , Benedetti found that Alzheimer 's patients with impaired cognitive function get less pain relief from analgesic drugs than normal volunteers do .
Using advanced methods of EEG analysis , he discovered that the connections between the patients ' prefrontal lobes and their opioid systems had been damaged .
Healthy volunteers feel the benefit of medication plus a placebo boost .
Patients who are unable to formulate ideas about the future because of cortical deficits , however , feel only the effect of the drug itself .
The experiment suggests that because Alzheimer 's patients do n't get the benefits of anticipating the treatment , they require higher doses of painkillers to experience normal levels of relief .
Benedetti often uses the phrase " placebo response " instead of placebo effect .
By definition , inert pills have no effect , but under the right conditions they can act as a catalyst for what he calls the body 's " endogenous health care system . "
Like any other internal network , the placebo response has limits .
It can ease the discomfort of chemotherapy , but it wo n't stop the growth of tumors .
It also works in reverse to produce the placebo's evil twin , the nocebo effect .
For example , men taking a commonly prescribed prostate drug who were informed that the medication may cause sexual dysfunction were twice as likely to become impotent .
Further research by Benedetti and others showed that the promise of treatment activates areas of the brain involved in weighing the significance of events and the seriousness of threats .
" If a fire alarm goes off and you see smoke , you know something bad is going to happen and you get ready to escape , " explains Tor Wager , a neuroscientist at Columbia University .
" Expectations about pain and pain relief work in a similar way .
Placebo treatments tap into this system and orchestrate the responses in your brain and body accordingly . "
In other words , one way that placebo aids recovery is by hacking the mind 's ability to predict the future .
We are constantly parsing the reactions of those around us — such as the tone a doctor uses to deliver a diagnosis — to generate more - accurate estimations of our fate .
One of the most powerful placebogenic triggers is watching someone else experience the benefits of an alleged drug .
Researchers call these social aspects of medicine the therapeutic ritual .
In a study last year , Harvard Medical School researcher Ted Kaptchuk devised a clever strategy for testing his volunteers ' response to varying levels of therapeutic ritual .
The study focused on irritable bowel syndrome , a painful disorder that costs more than $ 40 billion a year worldwide to treat .
First the volunteers were placed randomly in one of three groups .
One group was simply put on a waiting list ; researchers know that some patients get better just because they sign up for a trial .
Another group received placebo treatment from a clinician who declined to engage in small talk .
Volunteers in the third group got the same sham treatment from a clinician who asked them questions about symptoms , outlined the causes of IBS , and displayed optimism about their condition .
Rx for Success — — — — ——
What turns a dummy pill into a catalyst for relieving pain , anxiety , depression , sexual dysfunction , or the tremors of Parkinson 's disease ?
The brain 's own healing mechanisms , unleashed by the belief that a phony medication is the real thing .
The most important ingredient in any placebo is the doctor 's bedside manner , but according to research , the color of a tablet can boost the effectiveness even of genuine meds — or help convince a patient that a placebo is a potent remedy .
— Steve Silberman
Yellow pills
make the most effective antidepressants , like little doses of pharmaceutical sunshine .
Red pills
can give you a more stimulating kick .
Wake up , Neo .
The color green
reduces anxiety , adding more chill to the pill .
White tablets —
particularly those labeled " antacid " — are superior for soothing ulcers , even when they contain nothing but lactose .
More is better ,
scientists say .
Placebos taken four times a day deliver greater relief than those taken twice daily .
Branding matters .
Placebos stamped or packaged with widely recognized trademarks are more effective than " generic " placebos .
Clever names
can add a placebo boost to the physiological punch in real drugs .
Viagra implies both vitality and an unstoppable Niagara of sexy .
Not surprisingly , the health of those in the third group improved most .
In fact , just by participating in the trial , volunteers in this high - interaction group got as much relief as did people taking the two leading prescription drugs for IBS .
And the benefits of their bogus treatment persisted for weeks afterward , contrary to the belief — widespread in the pharmaceutical industry — that the placebo response is short - lived .
Studies like this open the door to hybrid treatment strategies that exploit the placebo effect to make real drugs safer and more effective .
Cancer patients undergoing rounds of chemotherapy often suffer from debilitating nocebo effects — such as anticipatory nausea — conditioned by their past experiences with the drugs .
A team of German researchers has shown that these associations can be unlearned through the administration of placebo , making chemo easier to bear .
Meanwhile , the classic use of placebos in medicine — to boost the confidence of anxious patients — has been employed tacitly for ages .
Nearly half of the doctors polled in a 2007 survey in Chicago admitted to prescribing medications they knew were ineffective for a patient 's condition — or prescribing effective drugs in doses too low to produce actual benefit — in order to provoke a placebo response .
The main objections to more widespread placebo use in clinical practice are ethical , but the solutions to these conundrums can be surprisingly simple .
Investigators told volunteers in one placebo study that the pills they were taking were " known to significantly reduce pain in some patients . "
The researchers were n't lying .
These new findings tell us that the body 's response to certain types of medication is in constant flux , affected by expectations of treatment , conditioning , beliefs , and social cues .
For instance , the geographic variations in trial outcome that Potter uncovered begin to make sense in light of discoveries that the placebo response is highly sensitive to cultural differences .
Anthropologist Daniel Moerman found that Germans are high placebo reactors in trials of ulcer drugs but low in trials of drugs for hypertension — an undertreated condition in Germany , where many people pop pills for herzinsuffizienz , or low blood pressure .
Moreover , a pill 's shape , size , branding , and price all influence its effects on the body .
Soothing blue capsules make more effective tranquilizers than angry red ones , except among Italian men , for whom the color blue is associated with their national soccer team — Forza Azzurri !
But why would the placebo effect seem to be getting stronger worldwide ?
Part of the answer may be found in the drug industry 's own success in marketing its products .
Potential trial volunteers in the US have been deluged with ads for prescription medications since 1997 , when the FDA amended its policy on direct - to - consumer advertising .
The secret of running an effective campaign , Saatchi & Saatchi's Jim Joseph told a trade journal last year , is associating a particular brand - name medication with other aspects of life that promote peace of mind : " Is it time with your children ?
Is it a good book curled up on the couch ?
Is it your favorite television show ?
Is it a little purple pill that helps you get rid of acid reflux ? "
By evoking such uplifting associations , researchers say , the ads set up the kind of expectations that induce a formidable placebo response .
The success of those ads in selling blockbuster drugs like antidepressants and statins also pushed trials offshore as therapeutic virgins — potential volunteers who were not already medicated with one or another drug — became harder to find .
The contractors that manage trials for Big Pharma have moved aggressively into Africa , India , China , and the former Soviet Union .
In these places , however , cultural dynamics can boost the placebo response in other ways .
Doctors in these countries are paid to fill up trial rosters quickly , which may motivate them to recruit patients with milder forms of illness that yield more readily to placebo treatment .
Furthermore , a patient 's hope of getting better and expectation of expert care — the primary placebo triggers in the brain — are particularly acute in societies where volunteers are clamoring to gain access to the most basic forms of medicine .
" The quality of care that placebo patients get in trials is far superior to the best insurance you get in America , " says psychiatrist Arif Khan , principal investigator in hundreds of trials for companies like Pfizer and Bristol - Myers Squibb .
" It 's basically luxury care . "
Big Pharma faces additional problems in beating placebo when it comes to psychiatric drugs .
One is to accurately define the nature of mental illness .
The litmus test of drug efficacy in antidepressant trials is a questionnaire called the Hamilton Depression Rating Scale .
The HAM- D was created nearly 50 years ago based on a study of major depressive disorder in patients confined to asylums .
Few trial volunteers now suffer from that level of illness .
In fact , many experts are starting to wonder if what drug companies now call depression is even the same disease that the HAM -D was designed to diagnose .
Existing tests also may not be appropriate for diagnosing disorders like social anxiety and premenstrual dysphoria — the very types of chronic , fuzzily defined conditions that the drug industry started targeting in the '90s , when the placebo problem began escalating .
The neurological foundation of these illnesses is still being debated , making it even harder for drug companies to come up with effective treatments .
What all of these disorders have in common , however , is that they engage the higher cortical centers that generate beliefs and expectations , interpret social cues , and anticipate rewards .
So do chronic pain , sexual dysfunction , Parkinson's , and many other ailments that respond robustly to placebo treatment .
To avoid investing in failure , researchers say , pharmaceutical companies will need to adopt new ways of vetting drugs that route around the brain 's own centralized network for healing .
Ten years and billions of R&D dollars after William Potter first sounded the alarm about the placebo effect , his message has finally gotten through .
In the spring , Potter , who is now a VP at Merck , helped rev up a massive data - gathering effort called the Placebo Response Drug Trials Survey .
Under the auspices of the FNIH11 , Potter and his colleagues are acquiring decades of trial data — including blood and DNA samples — to determine which variables are responsible for the apparent rise in the placebo effect .
Merck , Lilly , Pfizer , AstraZeneca , GlaxoSmithKline , Sanofi-Aventis , Johnson & Johnson , and other major firms are funding the study , and the process of scrubbing volunteers ' names and other personal information from the database is about to begin .
In typically secretive industry fashion , the existence of the project itself is being kept under wraps .
FNIH staffers 22 are willing to talk about it only anonymously , concerned about offending the companies paying for it .
For Potter , who used to ride along with his father on house calls in Indiana , the significance of the survey goes beyond Big Pharma 's finally admitting it has a placebo problem .
It also marks the twilight of an era when the drug industry was confident that its products were strong enough to cure illness by themselves .
" Before I routinely prescribed antidepressants , I would do more psychotherapy for mildly depressed patients , " says the veteran of hundreds of drug trials .
" Today we would say I was trying to engage components of the placebo response — and those patients got better .
To really do the best for your patients , you want the best placebo response plus the best drug response . "
The pharma crisis has also finally brought together the two parallel streams of placebo research — academic and industrial .
Pfizer has asked Fabrizio Benedetti to help the company figure out why two of its pain drugs keep failing .
Ted Kaptchuk is developing ways to distinguish drug response more clearly from placebo response for another pharma house that he declines to name .
Both are exploring innovative trial models that treat the placebo effect as more than just statistical noise competing with the active drug .
Benedetti has helped design a protocol for minimizing volunteers ' expectations that he calls " open/ hidden . "
In standard trials , the act of taking a pill or receiving an injection activates the placebo response .
In open / hidden trials , drugs and placebos are given to some test subjects in the usual way and to others at random intervals through an IV line controlled by a concealed computer .
Drugs that work only when the patient knows they 're being administered are placebos themselves .
Ironically , Big Pharma 's attempt to dominate the central nervous system has ended up revealing how powerful the brain really is .
The placebo response does n't care if the catalyst for healing is a triumph of pharmacology , a compassionate therapist , or a syringe of salt water .
All it requires is a reasonable expectation of getting better .
That 's potent medicine .

What We Don't Know
“ The main problem in Egypt is follow - up , ” said Sabir Abdel Aziz Galal , chief of the infectious disease department at the Ministry of Agriculture .
“ A decision is taken , there is follow - up for a period of time , but after that , they get busy with something else and forget about it .
This is the case with everything . ”

Speaking broadly , there are two systems for receiving services in Egypt :
The government system and the do - it - yourself system .
Instead of following the channels of bureaucracy , most people rely on an informal system of personal contacts and bribes to get a building permit , pass an inspection , get a driver ’s license  or make a living .
“ The straight and narrow path is just too bureaucratic and burdensome for the rich person , and for the poor , the formal system does not provide him with survival , it does not give him safety , security or meet his needs , ” said Laila Iskandar Kamel , chairwoman of a community development organization in Cairo .
Cairo ’s garbage collection belonged to the informal sector .
The government hired multinational companies to collect the trash , and the companies decided to place bins around the city .
But they failed to understand the ethos of the community .
People do not take their garbage out .
They are accustomed to seeing someone collecting it from the door .
For more than half a century , those collectors were the zabaleen , a community of Egyptian Christians who live on the cliffs on the eastern edge of the city .
They collected the trash , sold the recyclables and fed the organic waste to their pigs  which they then slaughtered and ate .
Killing all the pigs , all at once , “ was the stupidest thing they ever did , ” Ms. Kamel said , adding , “ This is just one more example of poorly informed decision makers . ”
A Change of the Debate
The condition of contemporary political dialogue is disgraceful .
Rather than debating the issues , American media figures , politicians , and commentators repeat old arguments and report valueless stories .
For example , no less than 8,826 news stories were written on our nation ’s ( so - called ) “ beer summit . ” 
To be frank , who cares ?
Is it uplifting ?
No .
Is it encouraging ?
No .
Is it intellectually stimulating ?
No .
Does it matter beyond the clicking of cameras ?
No .
The political debate today should not be commenced with insults ( Obama , “ stupid ”  ) , race baiting ( Professor Gates ) , or unwarranted accusations ( Glenn Beck , Obama is “ a racist ”  ) .
That ’s not debate .
That ’s diatribe .
A Change of the Motive
Essentially , Republicans want you to vote Republican and Democrats want you to vote Democrat .
There you have it , that ’s the motive .
That , however , is the wrong motive .
Remember , why do we debate ?
Ostensibly to determine the best solution .
But if ultimately the debate is motivated by party - politics , the actual purpose for debate is negated .
A Change of the Presentation
Television news is a beauty pageant .
Talk radio is a shock - jock contest .
Blogging is an unending competition between party - liners and ignoramuses .
We do n’t need the prettiest face in America to report our news .
We need the most articulate , intelligent , and proficient individual .
We do n’t need hate and the party - line to be constantly propagated by the radio waves .
We need the facts , the truth , and the solution .
We do n’t need ignorance and insults to populate the internet .
We need reason , principle , and intelligence to be king .
A Change of the Politics
Think of obesity .
It is one of the leading causes of preventable death worldwide .
Among Americans it is an epidemic .
But is it a hot political issue ( as it should be ) ?
Of course not .
Why should it be , when we can listen to David Letterman make off - color jokes about Sarah Palin ’s son who suffers from Down Syndrome ?
Think of the environment .
Republicans and Democrats disagree over the interpretation of science .
Who cares ?
There are so many other ways that we can protect the environment .
Think of recycling , conservation , elimination of hazardous chemicals , compost piles , electronic document conversion , telecommuting , vanpools , solar powered water heaters , the list does not end .
Think of our broken public school system .
Think of the potential of school choice .
This should not be a political issue .
Charter schools .
Home schools .
Private schools .
Religious schools .
Statistically all of these outperform their public counterparts .
The numbers do n’t lie .
It is nothing short of hypocrisy to declare support for “ progressivism ”  on the one hand and defend a broken system on the other .
Think of social justice .
Our system of foreign aid must be revamped .
Rather than making developing countries dependent on American foreign aid , we should concentrate it in areas where it permanently changes entire countries and makes future American aid unnecessary .
By spreading American solutions to poor African and Asian countries and encouraging entrepreneurship this can be accomplished .
A Change of the Terms
Both Conservatism and Progressivism are inaccurate ideological descriptions .
The Oxford English Dictionary defines Conservative as “ a tendency to preserve or keep intact or unchanged . ” 
It is the acme of arrogance to blindly believe the principles , policies , and beliefs of the past are intrinsically better than contemporary beliefs .
This is not to disregard the canon of history .
Nay , this is to accept the great truth of history ” ” that man is not perfect ” ” and that man must always strive towards the high standard of truth , righteousness , and love .
The same is true of Progressivism .
Progress is an empty and unaccountable standard .
It can be good or bad .
To make decisions in the name of progress is to err .
An underlining philosophy must inform progress .
A Change of the Argument
Unbeknownst to many , policy discussions are not simply emotional appeals .
There is such thing as history , precedent , philosophy , literature , myth , science , and natural law .
Debates should be , and must be , informed by a holistic intellectual approach .
A Change of the Conclusion
The situation in America must change ” ” if it does not ” ” the results will be dire .
That much is clear .
We must look to the past for the purpose of securing our nation a better future .
We must reexamine old ideals , principles , and practices .
Today , we proudly proclaim our avant - garde status .
But we forget our heritage .
We forget history .
Jerusalem .
Athens .
Rome .
London .
These four cities shaped the American tradition .
To ignore the wisdom of the ages is akin to gouging out our nation ’s collective eyes .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
On Friday , the federal minimum wage rises for the third year in a row , sparking the perennial argument among economists :
Will it help workers at the bottom of the ladder , or will it kill their jobs ?
The U.S. minimum wage goes to $ 7.25 an hour , from $ 6.55 , according to the U.S. Department of Labor .
Most states have their own minimum wage , and employers are required to pay whichever is higher .
That means minimum wage workers will get a raise in 29 states and Washington , D.C.
In the remaining 21 states , they 'll see no change .
In some states , the increase will be more modest .
In New York , the state minimum wage is $ 7.15 an hour , so workers there will be paid an extra dime an hour , which means another $ 4 for a 40 - hour week .
But in states like Georgia , Virginia and Texas , workers are paid the current federal minimum of $ 6.55 , so they 'll get the largest raise of 70 cents , which translates into a $ 28 bump for a full - time week , or more than $ 1,400 a year .
Injecting money into the economy ?
Kai Filion , an economist with the Economic Policy Institute in Washington , estimated that more than 2.8 million workers will have their wages lifted to $ 7.25 an hour on Friday .
More than 1.6 million workers will also be indirectly affected , according to Filion , meaning their above - minimum wages will increase as the rising tide lifts all boats .
That adds up to nearly 4.5 million workers who would get a raise .
The impact varies widely from state to state , depending on state minimum wages and population .
In New York , with its $ 7.10 - an - hour state minimum , 63,000 workers would be directly impacted , according to the EPI , compared with 632,000 workers in Texas .
" Because it 's not a big increase , any impact will be modest , but it will be good , " said Heidi Shierholz , a minimum wage expert with the EPI .
" You 're seeing people say this is a wrong time to do this , but I think that is entirely wrong - headed .
They could not have planned this for a better time . "
Based on Filion 's estimates , the wage increase will inject $ 5.5 billion worth of extra spending into the economy over the next year .
" It gets additional money to low - wage workers , " said Shierholz .
" These are workers who are mostly struggling to get by and will spend that extra cash .
This is actually stimulus . "
Or fewer jobs for low - wage workers ?
Back in 2007 , before the current recession began , Congress passed a bill to increase the minimum wage , which was then $ 5.15 an hour , three times over three years .
Some economists believe that the Friday increase could n't be happening at a worse time .
The U.S. economy lost nearly 3.4 million jobs in the first half of 2009 , which is more than the 3.1 million lost in all of 2008 .
Suzanne Clain , professor and living wage expert at the Villanova School of Business in Pennsylvania , said that increasing the minimum wage would create additional financial hardships for employers , driving the nationwide unemployment rate above its current 9.5 % .
" My feeling is that increasing the minimum wage is going to put additional strain on the economy , " she said .
" Additional jobs will be lost as a result .
It puts stress on employers who are currently having very small profit margins . "
Clain conducted an analysis showing that the 13 states with the highest minimum wage -- exceeding the upcoming federal minimum of $ 7.25 an hour -- experienced higher unemployment levels than the other 37 states .
She said the unemployment rates were higher by an average of between 1.75 % and 2 % in those 13 states during the three - month period ending in May .
" Raising minimum wage rates will generally discourage businesses from employing people , " Clain said .
" We 're already suffering from a downturn phase . "
What about the waitresses ?
Regardless of whether Friday 's increase has a beneficial or negative effect on minimum - wage workers , there is one group that it always seems to leave behind , according to the National Employment Law Project : waiters , waitresses and other workers who rely on tips .
NELP , a New York and Washington - based advocacy group for low - wage workers , released a recent study highlighting the fact that the minimum wage for tip workers has remained frozen at $ 2.13 an hour since 1991 .
According to NELP , the buying power of this wage has fallen 36 % over the last 18 years .
" This disproportionately affects women , " said Raj Nayak , a lawyer with NELP .
" Waiters around the country have three times the poverty level of other workers .
It 's hard to depend on tips . "
To NELP , the solution is obvious : Raise the minimum wage for tipped workers .
In the study , the group said the federal government could follow the lead of some 13 states that guarantee tipped workers 60 % of the minimum wage , which was actually a federal policy until 20 years ago .
Better yet , the study suggests , the government could extend the same federal minimum wage to tipped workers as to any other wage earners , noting that this is already practiced in seven states , including California and Nevada .

For state Senate boss Pedro Espada Jr. , charity begins at home — with cushy jobs at his nonprofit health - care centers in The Bronx for his sons and extended family members .
The powerful majority leader — who last week was thwarted in his effort to create a $ 120,000 - per - year state job for a son — is being investigated by the state Attorney General ’s Office for turning his health - care charity into a family and political money tree .
The one - time Democratic turncoat controls the money flow as CEO of Comprehensive Community Development Corp. , which he founded in 1978 and which is the umbrella organization for Soundview HealthCare Network .
The corporation ’s five clinics serve more than 40,000 people each year , but critics say Espada has put to personal and political use some of the $ 15 million the organization pulls in annually .
“ For Pedro Espada , politics is a route to wealth and power , ” said a Bronx political insider .
Even as the geyser of cash rains on his family and on his political campaigns , Comprehensive Community Development owes some $ 347,000 in federal and state income tax withheld from employees , as well as unpaid unemployment taxes .
Espada associates have been raiding his health - care network till since the late 1990s .
The senator was acquitted of charges that he stole more than $ 200,000 in Medicaid cash in order to finance his and his son ’s political campaigns .
But four senior employees of the Soundview HealthCare Network were convicted in a scheme to divert state money to Espada ’s 2001 run for Bronx borough president .
The money had been intended for programs aiding poor women and children and HIV patients .
Among the charity ’s other lapses :
* Espada paid himself nothing in 2007 , IRS documents indicate — but the corporation ’s chief financial officer says they will be amended to show the lawmaker paid himself more than $ 450,000 a year , some $ 80,000 more than the standard for a charity its size .
* Espada stacks his nonprofit board with relatives and friends .
His grandfather Victor Feliciano — who is between 90 and 100 years old and lives in Puerto Rico — is on the board and votes via conference calls from the family compound there .
Lourdes Mocete , who is married to Espada ’s eldest son , Pedro G. Espada , is chairwoman of the board , according to 2007 tax records , the latest available .
Pedro G. Espada , 35 , draws a $ 90,000 salary , sources say , as Soundview ’s director of “ environmental care . ”
He abruptly resigned this week from a Senate job created by his dad after Attorney General Andrew Cuomo threatened a probe .
State law bans elected officials from participating in “ any decision to hire , promote , discipline or discharge a relative ” for any paid state post .
* Only one board member , T.L. Solimon , was identified as a doctor — but his license is no longer active .
“ By our standards for charities , neither the chair nor the treasurer should be compensated , directly or indirectly , ” said Bennett Weiner , who heads up the Wise Giving Alliance of the Better Business Bureau .
According to Weiner ’s analysis of the corporation ’s tax filings from 2005 to 2007 , Mocete profits indirectly from her husband ’s employment , even though she draws no salary as a board member .
* Espada ’s uncle , Juan Feliciano Jr. , was the chief executive officer at the Soundview medical clinic .
He left that position in January after he took an Albany job paying about $ 76,000 a year .
Meanwhile , Espada ’s other sons , Romero and Alejandro , each rake in about $ 90,000 at the Soundview Health Center on White Plains Road , a political insider said .
When The Post went looking for them there , they were not at work .
Romero Espada , 27 , is director of Soundview ’s “ help desk , ” a post he has held since 2006 .
His job is to train employees on the clinic ’s computer systems .
Alejandro Espada , 30 , oversees his father ’s five clinics , according to Soundview ’s longtime chief financial officer , Kenneth Brennan .
Brennan worked as campaign treasurer for Espada in 2001 and 2003 .
He sits on the corporate board and earns just under $ 136,000 , according to the nonprofit ’s 2006 tax filings , the most recent to list his salary .
Although charities are required to disclose personal relationships to explain possible conflicts of interest , a spokesman for Espada ’s charity refused to clarify board members ’ relationships with the lawmaker .
Alexander Fear , Soundview ’s legal counsel , stated in an e-mail that the board members “ volunteer their time and services as private citizens .
We do not have permission from board members to release personal information . ”
At least two of the Soundview employees who were convicted of fraud for rerouting funds to Espada ’s campaign — Sandra Love and Maria Cruz — are still employed there , The Post has learned .
Love is the site director for the Delany Sisters Health Clinic , one of the five medical centers under the Soundview umbrella .
Cruz is director of human resources for Soundview HealthCare Network .
In June , Espada and another Democratic senator , Hiram Monserrate , of Queens , threw the Senate into chaos when they defected to the Republicans .
The ensuing monthlong stalemate had the parties bidding against each other until last month , when a deal was reached for Espada to return to the Democratic fold and become the majority leader .

Back in March of this year , the Tata Nano — dubbed “ The People ’s Car ” due to it ’s affordability — was unveiled in India , causing quite a stir around the globe .
Â
During the booking period , which ran from April 9 through April 25 , nearly a quarter million were sold , with actual delivery beginning in July .
While the basic model of the Nano is relatively stripped down , the car has been widely hailed as revolutionary due to it ’s most important feature : it ’s $ 2,500 price tag .
Â
This price makes the Nano the cheapest / least expensive production car in the world .
Considering the tough economic times many of us our facing , coupled with the general woes of the U.S. auto industry , the idea of a small , fuel efficient and very cheap vehicle is certainly very appealing to the American consumer .
Â
That being said , would these factors be enough to make it worth it to Tata to sell the Nano in the United States ?
According to a recent poll on Daily Fuel Economy Tip , it seems that bringing the Nano to North America is something Tata should seriously consider .
Â
Here ’s how nearly 500 people responded when asked , “ would you be interested in buying a Nano ( the inexpensive Indian car ) if it became available in the U.S. ? ”
No – Definitely : 48 %
Yes – Definitely : 22 %
Probably Not : 12 %
Probably : 10 %
Unsure : 8 %
While the statistics may not be overwhelmingly in Tata ’s favor , think of it this way : if 2010 auto sales come in around the currently projected 12 million units , and 20 % of consumers did in fact seriously consider purchasing a Nano , Tata could conceivably sell 2 million or more cars .
Â
Granted this is a very simplistic overview that makes a lot of assumptions , but at the same time it ’s not hard to fathom how a $ 2,500 car would be appealing to many Americans .
In addition to the financial appeal of the Nano , there is also the environmental appeal : according to Tata , the Nano is designed to achieve a fuel economy of around 50 miles per gallon .
Â
After last year ’s spike in gasoline prices and the big push in the “ green movement , ” it seems that more consumers are looking to purchase smaller , more fuel efficient vehicles .
Â
Both factors — fuel economy and size — play right into the Nano ’s strengths .
That being said , there are some pretty obvious reasons why only 22 % of respondents would seriously consider purchasing one of these vehicles .
According to Tata ’s website , the standard Nano lacks air conditioning , power locks and windows , and a trunk that opens , so obviously anyone purchasing one of these cars would n’t be getting the “ standard options ” that most of us have become accustomed to .
Â
Additionally , you ’re never going to mistake the Nano for a performance vehicle , especially considering it tops out at about 50 miles per hour .
Â
Finally , because the Nano is so small , you lose a lot of the uitility even a standard sedan provides .
Let ’s be honest , you ’re not going to cart around the kids to soccer practice in a Nano .
Taking all of this into consideration , it seems to me that the Nano would be a perfect commuter car : small , fuel efficient and cheap !

A pair of humans living on the outskirts of civilization are captured and , after being sent to perform hard labor , they begin plotting a revolution to destroy the Psychlos .
At face value , the plot seems fairly straightforward , but in reality it is much more tiresome .
In addition to various sub-plots that fail to advance the story , we viewers are subjected to ridiculously convenient plot devices .
Spoiler alert : The Psychlos ' air explodes when exposed to radioactivity .
The humans are unsupervised as they are sent out to perform hard labor .
They stumble upon an old military base — complete with aircraft , training simulators and nuclear weapons .
And there is a teleportation device that enables the humans to transport a nuclear warhead to the Psychlos ' home world .
Topping things off are doses of bad special effects , campy acting and strange cinematography decisions by filming every shot at an angle and a color palette best described by the Providence Journal this way : " Battlefield Earth 's primary colors are blue and gray , adding to the misery .
Whenever we glimpse sunlight , the screen goes all stale yellow , as though someone had urinated on the print .
This , by the way , is not such a bad idea . "
Battlefield Earth leads the record for the number of Razzies " won " with a total of 8 , one of the many reasons why this movie starts our list .
9. Dungeons and Dragons :
The year was 2000 , and in exactly one year , Peter Jackson would take fantasy movies mainstream with the Lord of the Rings trilogy .
To the public — especially those of us following LotR closely — it appeared the producers and studios responsible for Dungeons and Dragons were only trying to cash in early on the fantasy buzz .
Armed with $ 35 million and cast of fairly decent actors including Jeremy Irons and Thora Birch , the film sought to bring the venerable role - playing game alive .
The plot , if you could call it that , centers around an evil wizard who seeks to control red dragons , and the party dispatched by the Empress of Izmer to stop him .
It just would n't be a D&D movie without plenty of D&D references , so they 've thoughtfully provided characters with various classes including a wizard , thieves , a dwarf and a ranger and ... that 's about it .
Include plenty of cringe - worthy dialog such as , " Just like a thief to go around taking other people 's things , " and it 's no wonder why this film was n't a box - office smash .
While fantasy fans have had to suffer through their fair share of bad interpretations of the genre , as well as films shot with underwhelming budgets for the stories at hand , what gets us is how this film tramples on such a beloved property just for the sake of making a buck .
And for that , we cast Plane Shift on this film and send it to the Negative Energy Plane ( as opposed to the Infinite Layers of the Abyss , which I 'm sure is where this movie emerged from ) .
8. Event Horizon :
No one will deny that space flight is dangerous .
In fact , any time mankind ventures into the unknown we can think of an infinite number of possible things that can go wrong , whether it be mechanical or psychological .
At Hollywood 's best , we have HAL from 2001 : a Space Odyssey , who turns on the human crew , perceiving them to be a threat to the mission .
Or the film Alien , where a deep space crew responding to a distress beacon discovers a horrific alien species .
At Hollywood 's worst , we have this movie .
Event Horizon ( a fitting entry into Wired.com 's series , no ? ) is the name of a prototype ship on its maiden voyage with an experimental propulsion system that allows it to travel great distances in a short amount of time by creating a black hole to bridge the two points in space .
Sounds like a fantastically safe idea .
Unfortunately for the crew of the Event Horizon , the system does n't work as expected , and actually creates a bridge between themselves — AND HELL !
Or something like that .
One thing leads to another and soon some of the crew are trying to kill each other in various grotesque ways , others are trying to escape , and one tries to fire up the propulsion system again to return to that place of chaos .
Some claim it 's entertaining .
Others enjoy the soundtrack .
But for us , cult - following or not , there 's too much bad science and ridiculous horror to think this film deserves anything other than collapsing in on itself .
7. Lost in Space :
The late '90s saw the beginning of Hollywood 's obsession with remaking old movies and TV shows .
And in 1998 , New Line Cinema brought an all - star cast together to re-envision the classic 1965 television series , Lost In Space .
What they did n't bring were good writers .
The screenplay does n't amount to much more than a stream - of - consciousness single draft that tries to have plenty of action and suspense , but little of what made the television series endearing : family values , sticking together and surviving through ingenuity .
Lost in Space , the movie , is full of predictable action , predictable character arcs , robots , metallic spiders , time travel ( and subsequent time paradoxes if you think about it for more than one second ) , and a cute alien pet — you know , for the kids .
Oh , and the antagonist , Dr. Zachary Smith , becomes a human / metallic spider hybrid thing .
( I 'm sorry , Gary Oldman . )
The most satisfying part of researching for this post was turning up Roger Ebert 's verdict on Lost in Space : " This is the kind of movie that , if it fell into a black hole , you would n't be able to tell the difference . "
We could n't agree more , Roger .
6. Tim Burton 's Planet of the Apes : Good science fiction challenges us to think critically about an aspect of our current society .
It 's easier to examine a complex issue if we separate it contextually from everyday life .
These works are often called science fiction only because they take place in the future with advances in society and technology serving as a backdrop , rather than an integral part , of the story .
In the original Planet of the Apes movie , we examine issues of prejudice , creationism and nuclear war .
The famous twist at the end is where we confront those issues head - on .
We see the relationship between the world created for us in the film and the world we live in , and what about our world that needs changing .
Unfortunately , Tim Burton shows us none of that .
His remake is just spectacle , frequently relying on action over storytelling .
Rather than the twist being the fate of mankind due to our past actions , his twist has the main antagonist traveling back in time to change the present .
There are no lessons to be learned , nothing to think critically about .
So we ask ourselves , what was the point ?
But I guess we should n't be surprised , as the remake premiered during the summer blockbuster season .
And the film does n't try to be anything more than that .
For fans of the 1968 version , though , it felt especially hollow .
It 's just another example of a remake that did n't need to be made at all .
5. Star Trek V : William
Shatner likely had big ideas he wanted to explore with his directorial debut of a Star Trek movie .
Consider the overall plot :
The Enterprise voyages into the great unknown , to a region of space called the Great Barrier where they are told God exists .
But once they cross the Great Barrier , the film is a great letdown .
In addition to the ridiculously slow start and awkward light - hearted moments with the crew , there is an emotionally driven Vulcan half - brother of Spock , and a Klingon kidnapping plot that defies understanding in its resolution .
There were also budget and production problems , which resulted in Industrial Light and Magic not doing the special effects .
The film suffered there , too .
Overall , this is considered the worst of all of the Star Trek movies and , until the release of Star Trek Nemesis , the worst box - office performer of the series .
It also won the awards for Worst Picture of 1989 , Worst Director and Worst Actor for William Shatner at the Golden Raspberry Awards .
All of this is unfortunate for what the film could have been — a journey to strange new worlds exploring big ideas .
But the failed execution of whatever vision Shatner had for this entry into GeekDad 's beloved Star Trek universe lands it on our list of films to boldly go to the real final frontier : the nearest black hole .
4. Batman Forever : I gave Tim Burton considerable flack in the Planet of the Apes banishment , but he got a lot of things right with the first two Batman movies in the late ' 80s and early '90s .
His films were allowed to be dark , due to the success of Frank Miller 's The Dark Knight Returns and Alan Moore / Brian Bolland 's The Killing Joke .
And it was also easily accessible by people who had never read the comics .
Unfortunately for fans of the series , Warner Brothers decided to camp up the next installment when it green - lighted Batman Forever .
The film is wrought with silliness , plenty of bad dialog and poor casting decisions .
( We 'd rather see Billy Dee Williams as Two Face , Jim Carrey 's bit was getting pretty old by this point , and Val Kilmer ... seriously ? )
What 's worse , however , is that the film was successful at the box office , which led to the even more egregious Batman and Robin to be made .
But following the laws of causality , it would n't have been possible were it not for the success of Batman Forever .
These films are made all the worse when you consider that they required a reboot of the franchise to give us Batman Begins and The Dark Knight .
Of course , with ending what Tim Burton started on such a sour note , maybe we should n't be so quick to judge .
By those same laws of causality , Christopher Nolan likely owes something to the legacy of Batman Forever , too .
3. Movies by Uwe Boll : The GeekDad writers submitted several movies by Uwe Boll to the list of movies to be thrown into a black hole , and there was no clear winner .
Mr. Boll has been responsible for many video - game - to - film adaptations that alienate fans , and often the results are mind - numbingly bad .
Instead of asking yourself , " Who made this film ? " you often are instead asking , " Who approved and financed this film ? "
At a certain point , you 'd think his reputation as a filmmaker would begin to preclude him from making these movies .
In Wired.com writer Chris Kohler 's review of Postal , he writes , " Boll seems out to shock his audience into stunned disbelief rather than actually entertain them . "
This famously led to an exchange between Kohler and Boll over the internet .
And do n't forget about his successful campaign to box all of his critics , as chronicled by Wired 's Chris Baker .
But after his biggest flop ,
In the Name of the King : A Dungeon Siege Tale , Boll says he will be focusing on smaller films : " These are films that represent my true passion , and they can be done with small budgets . "
In the Name of the King cost $ 70 million to make and raked in a paltry $ 3 million at the box office .
Through all of this , it 's clear that Uwe Boll has a vision that he believes in .
It 's unfortunate that it 's so far removed from critics and viewers alike .
2 . The Matrix sequels : Just as Planet of the Apes was a movie that did n't need to be remade , neither was the The Matrix .
The two sequels that followed hurt more than they helped .
Perhaps it 's just a case of a sequel not living up to the expectations of its predecessor ;
The Matrix is one of the best science fiction films ever made , period .
The first 40 minutes of the original leaves you scratching your head , trying to figure out exactly what 's going on .
During the rest of the film , the pacing , the action and the story are beautiful in their execution .
The film ends with enough questions to keep the audience talking , speculating and watching again for new clues .
What we did n't need , however , were answers .
The answers are a letdown .
They were full of quasi-mysticism about the nature of man and machine .
They over - explain to the point of confusion what the " programs " in the matrix are for , and the iterative nature of the matrix , but fail to explain how The One 's powers extend into the real world .
On the surface it feels like lazy writing , and in that we begin to think more critically about the writing in the rest of the films .
The sequels also feel bloated by the special effects in a way the first film did n't .
At various points , the story just stops so we can see our protagonists fight the bad guys in various unbelievable ways .
What began as a compelling story moves steadfastly into mind - numbing , summer - blockbuster territory .
And as such , we are left with less wonder and awe , which only taint subsequent viewings of the first film .
And for that reason alone , we 'd like to forget that Matrix Reloaded and Matrix Revolutions were ever made .
1. The Star Wars prequels : I wonder how much this entry needs explaining .
The first 15 minutes of Star Wars Episode I felt genuine , as if George Lucas was saying to the fans , " I know you 've waited a long time , " and was about to give us something special .
But once that was over a realization began to set in .
We 'd been duped .
Fans who had grown up with the original trilogy sat for the remainder of the film , mouths agape , staring dumbfounded at the screen .
What happened ?
Some say merchandising .
Others cite a heavy reliance on special effects and green - screens .
There 's a case for wooden acting and bad writing .
And the ridiculous pacing , apparently because no one thought viewers had an attention span of over a minute .
There was all the stereotyping , and of course , there was Jar Jar .
The only film in the series that started to live up to the potential of those first 15 minutes was Episode III , due in part to some great action sequences .
But even then , it was n't enough to save the series .
( Quoting Darth Vader : " Noooooo ! " )
Some may argue these films are n't meant for us , that they 're meant for the new generation of fans who had yet to see the original trilogy .
If that 's the case , I feel sorry for them , because they wo n't be able to separate the merits of the original trilogy from what came after ... er ... before .
Special thanks to all of the GeekDad writers who contributed to this list and for the editing powers of Jason B. Jones and Jonathan Liu .

They arrived at the Barnes & Noble at Union Square in small groups on Sunday afternoon , proceeding two and three at a time to the fourth floor , where they browsed among shelves holding books by authors like Jacques Derrida and Martin Heidegger .
By 5 o’clock a crowd of more than 100 had gathered .
Their purpose : to celebrate the publication of an English translation of a book called “ The Coming Insurrection , ” which was written two years ago by an anonymous group of French authors who call themselves the Invisible Committee .
More recently , the volume has been at the center of an unusual criminal investigation in France that has become something of a cause célèbre among leftists and civil libertarians .
The book , which predicts the imminent collapse of capitalist culture , was inspired by disruptive demonstrations that took place over the last few years in France and Greece .
It was influenced stylistically by Guy Debord , a French writer and filmmaker who was a leader of the Situationist International , a group of intellectuals and artists who encouraged the Paris protests of 1968 .
In keeping with the anarchistic spirit of the text , the bookstore event was organized without the knowledge or permission of Barnes & Noble .
The gathering was intended partly as a show of solidarity with nine young people  including one suspected of writing “ The Coming Insurrection ”  whom in November the French police accused of forming a dangerous “ ultraleftist ” group and sabotaging train lines .
August 28 , 2008  --
One of the men investigated for allegedly threatening presidential candidate Barack Obama 's life while on a methamphetamine binge , is scheduled to appear in federal court this afternoon on a charge of possessing the narcotic .
Tharin Robert Gartrell is currently in custody , along with two other men who face meth - related and illegal possession of firearms charges .
The arrest of the three men has focused renewed attention on the paranoia and psychosis that go along with abuse of the drug which is widely used across the country .
Medical experts say their supposed admissions about an assassination plot fit into the expected pattern of erratic behavior from meth users .
Gartrell , Shawn Robert Adolf , and Nathan Johnson expressed strongly racist views and spoke about killing the Democratic presidential nominee while using meth , according to U.S. Atty .
Troy Eid .
The talk , Eid said , does not meet the legal standard for filing charges for threatening a presidential candidate .
Watch Charlie Gibson , Diane Sawyer and George Stephanopoulos at the Democratic Convention TONIGHT at 10 p.m. ET on ABC .
Doctors who study the effects of meth on the brain say the men would not likely have been able to carry out their alleged threats because meth make its user virtually incapable of completing any task besides getting more of the drug .
" There 's no way they could have gotten their act together to do anything because they are so paranoid , their thinking is so altered that they start things and they can't finish them , " said Dr. Richard Rawson , a professor at the UCLA School of Medicine who specializes in the study of methamphetamines and their affect on the brain .
" But , " he said , " It is scary to have the words methamphetamine , guns , and Democratic National Convention all in the same sentence . "
Rawson said the scales have tipped to where " hard core " addicts are using more and more meth while the number of new users is declining .
" There is this corps of more severely addicted people and they 're not the dabblers .
They 're heavy users and they get more meth psychosis , paranoia , and judgment impairment , " said Rawson .
" It 's more like heroin addiction . "
Part of the reason for this trend stems from recent laws that restrict the amount of pseudo - ephedrine , a key ingredient in meth manufacturing , that an individual can purchase at one time .
The effect has been that it is more difficult for people to get the ingredients to make meth at home or in their vehicles : " We 've seen a decline in homemade meth because of this law . "
A mobile methamphetamine lab was found in the vehicle of one of the men arrested .
Rawson said that some highly addicted people will get around the new laws by doing something they called " smurfing , " where they go from one drug store to another and buy the maximum legal amount of pseudo - ephedrine off the shelf in order to have enough of the ingredient to " cook " the drug .
Though the new laws have helped to reduce the number of new meth users , they do n't necessarily translate into a smaller quantity of the drug overall in the United States .
Rawson says that Mexican cartels have moved in to supply the meth markets that are already well established .
The result , he said , is higher priced meth that is more potent and more addictive .

[ Haskell - cafe ] ANN : jail - 0.0.1 - Jailed IO monad
Hi all , I am very pleased to announce the first release of the jail [ 1,2 ] package .
A jailed IO monad that can restrict filesystem access for your code .
This package will soon be an integral part of the Salvia web server .
( a new and improved Salvia will be released soon )
Basic documentation of the jail package is included below .
Any comments , suggestions , audits , etc. are welcome !
Gr , -- Sebastiaan Visser [ 1 ]
Source repo : http://github.com/sebastiaanvisser/jail/ [ 2 ]
Hackage : http://hackage.haskell.org/package/jail
--------
Like all of us know , the IO monad from the System .
IO module is a wild beast allowing all forms of insecure computations that can read , or even worse , alter the real world .
Writing to sockets , deleting files or even launching missiles , its possibilities are endless .
This library provides a special IO module that wraps all file and handle based IO operations from the System .
IO module , but provides a possibility to run them in an restricted environment .
When running a jailed IO computation a file path can be specified all IO operations will be checked against .
Accessing files outside this directory is not allowed and results in a runtime error .
Additionally , when running a jailed IO computation a whitelist of file handles can be specified that are accessible as well .
For example , running some code with the permission to access all files within ( and only within ) my home directory and allowing to access the standard output and standard error can be enforced like this : Jail.run ( Just " / home / sebas " ) [ stdout , stderr ] yourUntrustworthyComputation
Only allowing the code to access the standard input and nothing else can be enforced like this : Jail.run Nothing [ stdin ] yourEvenMoreUntrustworthyComputation
Because the jailed IO environment keeps track of all file handles and checks that are opened by its own operations , smuggling in evil file handles from the fierce and dangerous outside world will be punished by border patrol .
Only handles from the whitelist or handles securely opened by functions like open
File will be accepted .
Because of the opaque IO constructor and the restricted set of exported operations this module is not easily fooled .
I would almost dare to say this module is conceptually safe and code with the jailed IO type can blindly be trusted .
Except , yes unfortunately except , unsafePerformIO ruins it all .
I would almost suggest adding a flag to the compiler to enforce the absence ofunsafeRuinMyTypeSafety - alike functions in order to be able to create systems in which code can be trusted by its type alone .
Nonetheless , this module is one step forward in trusting your own programs .
Some real http://tinyurl.com/paranoidpeople prefer writing there software in one of the most insecure programming languages and perform security audits by hand , I 'd rather have my compiler do the job .
( Anyone who wants to audit this library is more than welcome ! )
You know you ’ve seen them : junk - mail catalogs jam - packed with crap you ’d never in a million years want to own , let alone purchase yourself .
Everything from bird feeder squirrel traps to eyebrow - plucking combo-armpit razors .
Hell , even the ‘ As Seen on TV ’ ad folks have taken to advertising in this rag , up to and including several pictures of the exalted Billy Mays himself on every other page !
Ah but it ’s not any of these things - or people - I ’m mentioning today , oh hell no .
For the purposes of this ‘ magazine ’ breakdown , I went searching for the most ridiculous , outrageous , and just plain ‘ F ’d up things I could find .
And believe me : I did n’t have to look far , for within the hallowed pages of the Harriet Carter catalog lie some of the most diabolically asinine inventions of all time .
“ I ’m a Sport ’s Fan ! ” – The NFL Snuggler
Let ’s break down all the things wrong with this item , shall we ?
First off , no self - respecting dude ( regardless of age ) would be caught dead wearing a damn blanket touting his favorite football team .
I do n’t give a shit HOW warm it looks ; you = not a man if you ’re covered in a NFL fleece when your bro-buds come over to toss back a few cold ones and yell profanity at the big game .
Failure .
Epic .
Secondly .
Take a look at this guy .
Look some more .
Yeah , you get it .
Moving on .
“ Yeah … The Ladies are Gonna LOVE Me !’ – Hair Cutting Comb
Look , I cut my own hair , too .
Granted , I cut it all the way off … well , I guess that ’s more like shaving , but still .
The point I ’m trying to make is that this tool is , for lack of a better term , dumb .
Just look at the craftsmanship of the combination sharp comb / regular comb .
Just plain stunning .
Can you imagine the sheer ( ha ! ) agony of swiping this medieval tool through your coif ?
I ’d have to assume you ’d end up with a wadded tuft of scalp ripped from your skull rather than a clean , smooth , professional trim .
Ah but the chicks will swoon , man !
“ Um … That Looks Great , Mom … ” – Microwave Bacon Genie
Ya know , I love me some bacon .
I really , really do .
Bacon on sandwiches , bacon with pancakes , bacon in my bathtub … but I digress .
This is , with out a single doubt , the most wretched bacon I have ever seen and I would , under the right circumstances , eat bacon trampled on by a parade of zoo animals .
I think I ’d more likely eat raw bacon directly from the freezer that consume this scabbed corpse flesh .
If you have to cook bacon in a microwave , you sir or madam , do not deserve bacon .
Period .
“ Nipples ?
What Nipples ? ” – Silicone Concealers
Of the ten items I discovered on this list here , I ’d have to say these things are probably the most useful .
Why ?
Have you been somewhere - I do n’t know : mall , WalMart , a family reunion - and you happen upon a woman who might be , um , let ’s say , the polar opposite of pretty while at the same time not wearing a brassiere ?
Yeah , that ’s about as traumatic as catching your parents doing it .
The point is , no one wants to see nipples jutting from a ‘ Who Farted ? ’
T - shirt as they ’re shopping for groceries .
So , with these little silicone boob covers , you , too , can avoid harming the general public with your high - beams .
Please .
“ I ’ll cut you man !
Do n’t make me do it ! ” – Funny Needle T - Shirt
There ’s no doubt that humor is subjective .
You are , after all , reading this mess .
Be that as it may , there are certain subjects that just are n’t funny regardless of what you print on a T - Shirt : abortion , school shootings , knitting .
Take a long hard look at this woman ’s expression .
She has the far away sneer of a housewife , so angered and distraught by the lack of love for her husband , who has , in all likelihood , slaughtered the poor man .
He ’s probably lying in a pool of is own congealing blood on the kitchen floor , riddled with a multitude of killing needle holes .
Oh yeah , this lady has lost it .
The Wife - Beater That Trims Your Tummy !
– Men ’s Body Shaper
I ’m not really sure where to begin with this .
Is this guy just lonely and needy enough when attempting to score with a bar chick to want to wrap his beer gut in elastic ?
Or , perhaps he has a really important job interview at Burger King and does n’t want the 20 - year old night manager to see his paunch .
Or , my personal choice , he ’s the best man at his buddy ’s wedding and he really wants to look good in the photos .
Yeah , I got nothing .
Basically , this guy looks like he ’s trying to prevent the one tummy ailment one would achieve wearing that exact same tank - top .
I guess he ’s happy , though .
“ And … PRANCE ! ” – Stirrup Support Stretch Stockings
Fancy
Dan here has varicose veins , but that ’s not why he wears these high - fashion stockings !
Oh Heaven ’s no !
He is skipping and twirling his way to a brand new acting gig off - Broadway in a play called ‘ Prance ! ’
His audition went off without a hitch , thanks in part to his brand new stirrup socks that lift , separate , and remove the ache of sore leg muscles … and boy are they hot !
Dan is lucky to have friends like Muriel , Gladys , Audry , and Bill who bought him these awesome leggings in support of his newest job roll : that of a 30 ’s - era stripper !
From Gargoyle to … Less Gargoyle – Nonyx Nail Gel
I ’m not sure what ghastly disease this woman is suffering from on her little toe , but it looks a hell of a lot like leprosy !
If this is just one toe on her foot , I just have to assume the rest of this creature ’s gnarled talons are not going to be the least bit affected by this Nonyx crap .
It ’s like covering a hatchet wound with a Band - Aid .
I guess the point I ’m trying to illustrate here is that this stuff does n’t work .
Probably .
“ I Did n’t Order Pizza , But I Like Meat … Where Are You Going ? ” – Moisture - Absorbing Nightgown
The very description of this garment literally made me have to excuse myself to go throw up .
If you ’re sweating that much when you ’re sleeping , perhaps you need to either turn the air conditioning on or move off the surface of the sun !
Oh , sure , I ’ve woken up in a cold sweat before after a hellish nightmare featuring demon goats and Dick Van Patten , but I ’ve never once wished I was fully draped in a chamois !
Seriously , if you have to wring out your sheets and hang your night things outside after one night ’s sleep , I ’d recommend a doctor over a drying night shirt .
But that ’s just me .
The Newest in US Torture Techniques – Hair Cutting Umbrella
Before you even have to ask , this poor bastard is indeed wearing a Kiddie Pool on his collar .
I ’m not sure which I ’d hate to admit to more : having my own wife cut my hair , or having my own wife cut my hair while having my head thrust through a giant bunt pan .
If it takes more than a towel on the bathroom floor and your own vacuum cleaner to spruce up after a quick hair trim … in fact so much so that you need a manhole - sized trough encircling your neck , perhaps you ’re a werewolf or Robin Williams .
Either way , this shitty thing is stupid and shitty .
• NZ students find almost no vitamin C in drink • GlaxoSmithKline could face up to £ 1.1 m fine
Two New Zealand schoolgirls humbled one of the world 's biggest food and drugs companies after their school science experiment found that their ready - to - drink Ribena contained almost no trace of vitamin C .
Students Anna Devathasan and Jenny Suo tested the blackcurrant cordial against rival brands to test their hypothesis that cheaper brands were less healthy .
Instead , their tests found that the Ribena contained a tiny amount of vitamin C , while another brand 's orange juice drink contained almost four times more .
" We thought we were doing it wrong .
We thought we must have made a mistake , " Anna told New Zealand 's Weekend Herald .
The girls were both 14 and students at Pakuranga College in Auckland when they did the experiment in 2004 .
Given Ribena 's advertising claims that " the blackcurrants in Ribena have four times the vitamin C of oranges " , they were astonished and wrote to the manufacturers , GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) .
When they got no response , they phoned the company , but were given short shrift .
" They did n't even really answer our questions .
They just said it 's the blackcurrants that have it , then they hung up , " Jenny said .
But then the girls ' claims were picked up by a TV consumer affairs programme , Fair Go , which suggested they take their findings to the commerce commission , a government watchdog .
GSK said the girls had tested the wrong product , and it was concentrated syrup which had four times the vitamin C of oranges .
But when the commerce commission investigated , it found that although blackcurrants have more vitamin C than oranges , the same was not true of Ribena .
It also said ready - to - drink Ribena contained no detectable level of vitamin C .
GSK is in court in Auckland today facing 15 charges relating to misleading advertising , risking fines of up to NZ$ 3 m ( £ 1.1 m ) .
In Australia , GSK has admitted that its claims about Ribena may have misled consumers .
The Australian competition and consumer commission said last week that claims on the nutrition information panel of Ribena 's ready - to - drink cartons implied that the product had four times the vitamin C of orange juice drinks , when this was not correct .
The girls have since visited GSK to be thanked " for bringing it to our attention " .
GSK said in a statement yesterday that concerns about vitamin C only affected some products in Australia and New Zealand .
" GSK has conducted thorough laboratory testing of vitamin C levels in Ribena in all other markets .
This testing has confirmed that Ribena drinks in all other markets , including the UK , contain the stated levels of vitamin C , as described on product labels . "
" I remember getting a call from the , er , fire department commander , telling me that they were not sure they were gonna be able to contain the fire , and I said , ' We 've had such terrible loss of life , maybe the smartest thing to do is pull it . '
And they made that decision to pull and we watched the building collapse . "
In 2005 a spokesman for Silverstein Properties stated " pull it " referred to withdrawing firefighters from WTC 7 , but this statement does not withstand scrutiny .
Jihadists close to al - Qaeda explicitly warned that Germany will be the target of the next 9/11 - scale terrorist attack - within the next few weeks .
Jihadists close to al - Qaeda explicitly warned in new communications that Germany will be the target of the next 9/11 - scale terrorist attack .
The timing of the strike , they say , will be within the next few weeks .
According to analysts with the Institute of Terrorism Research and Response ( ITRR ) , a recently intercepted jihadist communication declares that " everyone knows " that the " next strike is very near , a strike that will surprise everyone in its effect , which will be much more shocking than that of 9/11/2001 . "
The writer of the chilling message notes that this is the Muslim month of Ramadan and that " we pray that it will indeed be in this month . "
After referring to a previous boast by Osama Bin-Laden , that the enemy is afraid and unable to prevent the next attack , the communication says :
" And the Germans , grandchildren of the Nazis , know more than everyone else that they will be the first ones to taste [ the nightmare ] .
It is just a matter of time - that is , days or weeks - and God willing you 'll see things that you 've never heard of before . "
While Germany and German assets have been singled out in the past , due to that nation 's involvement in the war in Afghanistan , the threats have been general and motivational in nature .
According to ITRR , the latest jihadist communication was unusual in that it was very explicit and open in targeting the Germans , in discussing a coming attack , and in specifying its timing .
Aside from Ramadan , which ends 19 September 2009 , the upcoming German national election on September 27 has been marked as a " red flag date " by ITRR .
Jihadists keen on disrupting and influencing European foreign policy are likely to attempt attacks around the time of the elections .
German security services have also been cited in local media discussing stepped up jihadist chatter , threats and intelligence warnings aimed at the German state in recent months .
Earlier this year , video messages delivered in German by an al - Qaeda fighter going by the name of Abu Talha , purportedly in Afghanistan , called on Germans to convert to Islam and remove their several thousand troops from the Afghan theater .
According to a June report by Der Spiegel weekly , American intelligence agencies believe that al - Qaeda 's leaders have decided to attack Germany , supposedly assigning the job to al - Qaeda of the Islamic Maghreb ( North Africa ) .

Initial jobless claims rose last week , a bit higher than expected , but that ’s not what was featured at the top of the article below .
Instead , the claim was made that because the number of people on the unemployment rolls dropped , that this was a signal that the labor market may be stabilizing .
This is an inappropriate and misleading claim to make .
U.S. Initial Jobless Claims Rose to 558,000 Last Week Aug. 13 ( Bloomberg ) —
The number of Americans filing first - time claims for jobless benefits unexpectedly rose last week , while the number of people on unemployment rolls dropped to the lowest since April , signaling the labor market may be stabilizing as the recession eases .
Applications rose to 558,000 in the week ended Aug. 8 from a revised 554,000 the week before , the Labor Department said today in Washington , while staying under 600,000 for a sixth time .
The number of people collecting unemployment benefits fell by 141,000 in the week ended Aug. 1 to 6.2 million .
The really interesting part about this is that a huge amount of electronic ink has been dedicated lately to the understanding that dwindling unemployment rolls is being driven to an enormous extent by the fact that benefits are running out for people .
This next chart ( source ) shows the unemployment insurance " exhaustion rate " stretching back more than three decades .
When it is going up it means that more people are dropping off the rolls because their insurance ran out .
We are seeing a record number of people losing their insurance , a multi- decade high in fact , and this is the primary reason that the unemployment insurance rolls have been dropping , not because these people have found jobs .
On August 1st the NYTimes reported that by year end 1.5 million people will exhaust all their benefits and drop off the roles .
Prolonged Aid to Unemployed Is Running Out
Over the coming months , as many as 1.5 million jobless Americans will exhaust their unemployment insurance benefits , ending what for some has been a last bulwark against foreclosures and destitution .
Because of emergency extensions already enacted by Congress , laid - off workers in nearly half the states can collect benefits for up to 79 weeks , the longest period since the unemployment insurance program was created in the 1930s .
But unemployment in this recession has proved to be especially tenacious , and a wave of job - seekers is using up even this prolonged aid .
Tens of thousands of workers have already used up their benefits , and the numbers are expected to soar in the months to come , reaching half a million by the end of September and 1.5 million by the end of the year , according to new projections by the National Employment Law Project , a private research group .
To put this in perspective , this is the same as if every single working person in Oregon were on the dole and ran out of benefits ( source ) .
In a single year .
The confusing part is that there are now two sources of unemployment insurance for people ; state and federal ( through the Emergency Unemployment Compensation benefits program ) .
Unemployment Insurance Extended Benefits Extended Benefits are available to workers who have exhausted regular unemployment insurance benefits during periods of high unemployment .
The basic Extended Benefits program provides up to 13 additional weeks of benefits when a State is experiencing high unemployment .
Some States have also enacted a voluntary program to pay up to 7 additional weeks ( 20 weeks maximum ) of Extended Benefits during periods of extremely high unemployment .
Checking into this second source , federal benefits , we note that this number actually increased and now stands at 2.78 million individuals :
Further you might note that 448,000 people were receiving extended benefits during the week of July 25 , a drop of - 42,000 from the week prior .
Neither of these two numbers , the EUC nor the extended , are a part of the headline drop of - 141,000 in the unemployment rolls .
A complete and excellent explanation of this process can be found at Mish ’s site .
Another is at Barry Ritholtz ’ site .
Bottom line : there ’s a very different explanation for the drop in the unemployment rolls than a " recession that ’s easing " and it is not quite so nearly as positive .
The explanation is that benefits are simply running out and people are dropping off the rolls .
I would anticipate , however , that congress will pass an extension of the extension before allowing a full 1.5 million people to slip entirely out of the social safety net .
And why not ?
There have been no limits to the printing efforts so far and seemingly no ill effects besides a return of risk - asset trading on Wall Street ( which many consider a plus , not a minus ) .
But right now people are slipping off the unemployment rolls and for many that will be an extremely unpleasant experience .
Remember , jobs are not yet being created .
The excitement , such as it is , stems from the fact that we are losing them at a slower pace .

Its uses are limited — it exists solely to help train its user to throw a perfect serve height ( A high , confident toss made 1 to 2 ft. inside the baseline allows the server to uncoil both upward and forward into the court , making contact at 1.5 times body height ) — and it might not be terribly practical , but you have to admire the ingenuity .
Preemptive sic :
I poped ( ed note : this is my favorite new verb ) open my wiimote soldered in a few wires to the minus key and then taped the wiimote to left arm ( I am right handed ) .
Then I taped the other end of the wires to my thumb and wrapped a tennis ball in aluminum .
So now when I had the ball in my hand it completed the circuit and pressed the button which registers the data in the software .
I then toss the ball and when it leaves my hand it unpresses the button stopping the registry of the data from the accelerometer .

The law was seen as a step in lowering NZ 's high child abuse rates New Zealanders have voted by a wide margin in favour of allowing parents to smack their children , two years after a law banned discipline by force .
The legislation was brought in two years ago to try to lower the country 's high rate of child abuse .
The referendum asked : " Should a smack as part of good parental correction be a criminal offence in New Zealand ? "
The referendum is non-binding , and Prime Minister John Key has said he will not change the existing law .
Based on preliminary results , 54 % of the voting population took part in the referendum , with nearly 90 % responding No , the election commission said .
The United Nations Children 's Fund , Unicef , said in 2003 that New Zealand had the third - worst rate of child abuse and neglect of the OECD group of countries .
' Ambiguous question '
The vote was held following a campaign by opponents of the 2007 legislation , which removed a provision allowing parents " reasonable force " to discipline their children .
The legal change was to stop people using " parental discipline " as a defence against assault changes but allowed police wide latitude to not prosecute cases seen as trivial .
Opponents of the law said it would result in good parents being prosecuted .
WHERE SMACKING IS BANNED Austria , Bulgaria , Costa Rica , Croatia , Cyprus , Denmark , Finland , Germany , Greece , Hungary , Iceland , Israel , Latvia , Moldova , Netherlands , New Zealand , Norway , Portugal , Romania , Spain , Sweden , Ukraine , Uruguay , Venezuela Source : Endcorporalpunishment.org Referendum campaigner Larry Baldock said he was ecstatic at the vote 's result and hoped it would send a strong message to the prime minister that the current law was not working .
" There are an incredible number of people all over the country tonight who will be feeling really great about what they helped bring about with their vote . "
Many critics of the referendum , including the prime minister , said the question was loaded and ambiguous .
Mr Key , who did not cast a vote , said he would put some proposals on the issue to his cabinet on Monday .
" I think they will give New Zealand parents added comfort that the law is working , " he said .
The issue has provoked heated debate in the country , but the postal vote - at a cost of $ 6.1 m ( £ 3.7 m ) - is considered by many to have been a waste of time and money .
New Zealand is one of six countries to have banned corporal punishment of children in 2007 .
The first country to take the step was Sweden in 1979 , followed by Finland in 1983 and Norway in 1987 .

SEATTLE , Aug. 7 ( UPI ) --
The shrinking of three U.S. glaciers raises concerns about rising sea levels and the future availability of fresh drinking water , scientists said .
Climate change is shrinking the ice at an accelerated rate on the South Cascade Glacier in Washington state , the Wolverine Glacier on Alaska 's Kenai Peninsula and the Gulkana Glacier in interior Alaska , The McClatchy Newspapers reported Friday .

The three glaciers , known as benchmark glaciers , have shown a rapid and sustained retreat , U.S. Geological Survey scientist Ed Josberger said .
The shrinkage means changes in water temperature for insects , fish and animals downstream and less available drinking water , said USGS scientist Shad O'Neel .
At the beginning of the 20th century , the South Cascade Glacier was estimated to be about 654 million cubic yards .
By 1958 , it had shrunk to half that size .
In the years since , it has shrunk by half yet again , O'Neel said .
" These three glaciers have been losing mass since they 've been studied , and that mass loss has gotten more rapid in the past 15 years , " O'Neel said .

RIALTO , California ( Reuters ) - Fifty miles east of Los Angeles , a small and inconspicuous facility is using something most of us would rather not think about -- household sewage -- to create a resource we can’t live without -- fuel .
Local journalists are reflected in sewage ponds in a file photo .
REUTERS / David Gray
EnerTech Environmental , an Atlanta startup , on Thursday unveiled the United States ’ first commercial biosolids - to - energy facility in California ’s Inland Empire .
“ Biosolids ” is the nice term for processed sewage sludge .
The sludge is 80 percent water when it arrives at EnerTech ’s plant , where it is turned into fuel simply by removing most of that liquid .
The product customers buy is 95 percent solid and interchangeable with coal , according to Chief Executive Kevin Bolin , whose grandfather invented the company ’s patented “ SlurryCarb ” technology .
Enertech ’s “ E - fuel ” is already being used as a replacement for coal at two Southern California cement kilns , though it currently accounts for only about 10 percent of their needs .
“ With respect to the cement industry , we ca n’t make enough , ” Bolin said at the plant ’s ceremonial opening .
Biosolids are a renewable resource and do not add any net carbon dioxide to the atmosphere , Bolin said .
“ The CO2 is already in the cycle , ” he said .
The pungent smell that permeates the area comes from a nearby wastewater treatment plant , Bolin said .
EnerTech ’s plant started production earlier this year and is operating at about 60 percent capacity .
At full capacity , it will be able to take in 700 tons of biosolids to produce 170 tons of fuel a day .
That puts the facility on par with a roughly 7 - megawatt power plant , Bolin said .
Cement kilns are ideal customers for EnerTech ’s product because not only does it provide a renewable replacement for coal , the non-combustible portion of E - fuel is mixed into the cement itself , Bolin said .
EnerTech receives sewage sludge from five Southern California municipalities , including Orange County , Los Angeles and San Bernardino .
Because it provides a recycling service , EnerTech is paid by the cities and sanitation districts for managing their sewage sludge .
As a result , EnerTech ’s final product is cheaper to its customers than buying coal , Bolin said .
“ It ’s able to be cheaper than coal because the primary focus is the management of biosolids , ” Bolin said .
EnerTech , which counts Citigroup private equity unit Metalmark Capital and the Masdar Clean Tech Fund among its investors , expects to turn a profit next year , Bolin said .
It is expanding .
The company has partnered with Mitsubishi Kakoki Kaisha Ltd on a demonstration plant in Japan , and EnerTech is looking at other opportunities in the United States and the UK , Bolin said .
EnerTech plans to expand the Rialto plant to make fuel for Rentech Inc , a Los Angeles - based synthetic fuels maker that plans to use the biosolids to make transportation fuels .
It is also hopes to develop a plant in the New York City area .
EnerTech ’s SlurryCarb process is n’t limited to human sewage .
It can also treat animal manure , lumber and paper wastes and agricultural wastes .

A report has found four out of five parents have been left vexed by science questions asked by their children .
Could you do any better ?
Here are 10 of the best questions posed by children and sent in by readers .
Where do babies come from ?
What makes a rainbow ?
Why is the sky blue ?
When it comes to tough questions , every parent knows Jeremy Paxman is a pussycat compared with the interrogative demands of a typically curious child .
A survey of UK parents with children aged five to 16 found four in five mothers and fathers were flummoxed by the scientific ponderings of their offspring .
We asked readers to submit children 's questions which had left them similarly vexed .
Here are 10 of the best .
And here are suggestions on how to answer , from readers and from experts .
1 ) Why do n't all the fish die when lightning hits the sea ?
" My daughter tends to come out with a question like this , which totally confounds you , about once a week " , says Will Sharpe , from Sandy in Bedfordshire .
It was asked by his daughter , Kimberley , now six , when she was five , and may have followed a trip to feed the ducks .
" This is just one of those which stuck with me , I think I tried to fob it off .
She can be quite dippy at times , but can come out with these questions which seem totally profound , " he says .
2 ) How much does the sky weigh ?
I must admit all I could do was just laugh and say , ' because it is !'
Angela Fraser
Science questions baffle parents
This question was posed by Ken Bright 's son Ben , who is now 11 , when he was four , as they drove from their home in Brighton to a children 's zoo .
He says : " It 's stuck with me .
I think he was just looking out of the window of the car and just came out with it .
I looked at my partner Jane and said , " well , that 's quite a question .
What prompted it , I do n't know .
I said something along the lines of , ' It 's the weight of the universe minus the earth , because that 's what the sky is . '
I do n't think he understood . "
3 ) Why can't people leave other people alone ?
" This is a good one .
What can you tell your nine - year - old as to why people can't keep themselves to themselves ? " asks Martina , from London .
" Do you say , ' people just can't contain themselves , ' or ' people are n't aware they are doing it , ' or ' people are clumsy things ? ' "
4 ) Why are birds not electrocuted when they land on electricity wires ?
" My daughter , then six , threw me when she asked me this .
I had no idea , " says Jo from , North Yorkshire .
But I Googled it and got back to her .
It is important not to just say , ' I do n't know , shh , ' like I see some parents do .
Feed their inquisitive minds , and you may learn something yourself too . "
5 ) What is time ?
" I once heard a child ask a parent this .
A tough question perhaps , but unfortunately the parent replied , ' tick tock , tick tock , ' a far from satisfactory answer , " says Naomi , from Exeter .
" Although , ' the indefinite continued progress of existence and events in the past , present , and future regarded as whole ' might have been a bit much , " she adds .
6 ) Why is the Moon sometimes out in the day and sometimes at night ?
Emma Geertman , from Pembrokeshire says she was stumped by this question from her five - year - old .
" Thank goodness for the internet , " she says .
7 ) Why did God let my kitten die ?
Is the tricky question posed by a child and sent in by Darrow , from Leicester .
8 ) Why do I like pink ?
" If my children ask a question I do n't know the answer to , then we 'll go and look it up together .
I 've learnt some interesting things like that , " says Debbie Welch , from Surrey .
" Mind you , I was stumped by this question posed by my then four - year - old . "
9 ) Why is water wet ?
" My eldest daughter , who was about four or five at the time , once asked me this while she was sitting in the bath , " says Angela Fraser , from Swaffham in Norfolk .
" I must admit all I could do was just laugh and say , ' because it is ! ' " she says .
10 ) Why does my best friend have two dads ?
This is the sensitive question which has been posed by a child close to Daniel White , in Aberdare , Wales .
Here is a selection of readers ' answers to these questions .

Scientists from Canberra 's Australian National University ( ANU ) and Tianjin University in China have teamed up to develop new cheaper solar technology .
The two year project will pioneer the use of solar cells immersed in cooling fluid to make them more efficient and less expensive than current solar panels .
ANU Professor Andrew Blakers says the new solar systems will be able to simultaneously heat households , water and generate electricity .
" This combines the two functions into a single lightweight , low profile concentrator system , " he said .
" And because you 're utilising the same infrastructure for both electricity and heat collection you can aim to have a substantially reduced cost . "
Mr Blakers says it has the potential to make buildings carbon neutral .
" Inside that receiver immersed in mineral oil is a solar cell that absorbs about 20 per cent of the reflected sunlight to make electricity , " he said .
" The other 80 per cent becomes heat and can be used to make solar hot water and to heat houses in winter and to drive solar cooling in the summer . "

Obama team mulls new quarantine regs
The Obama administration is quietly dusting off an effort to impose new federal quarantine regulations , which were vigorously resisted by civil liberties organizations and the airline industry when the rules were first proposed by the Bush administration nearly four years ago .
White House officials are n’t saying what their rules might ultimately require .
But the previous administration proposed giving the federal government the authority to order a “ provisional quarantine ” of three business days — or up to six calendar days — for those suspected of having swine flu or other illnesses listed in a presidential executive order .

The Bush - era proposal would also have required airlines and cruise lines to store more information about domestic and international passengers , such as e-mail addresses , traveling companions and return flight information .
The information would be subject to review by federal officials in a health emergency , though it would be voluntary for passengers to provide the data .
Opponents of the Bush administration ’s efforts to enforce the new guidelines insist that they still are a mistake .
“ It ’s not really going to help , ” said Wendy Mariner , a professor of law and public health at Boston University .
“ The proposals to limit liberty represent a dangerous precedent to constitutional theory , particularly when there ’s almost no evidence it will matter .
...
It would n’t surprise me if they try to sneak this past in August , when people are away . ”
The White House ’s Office of Management and Budget has set a September target date to complete the first major overhaul of the quarantine regulations in about three decades .
That would have at least some of the rules in place if swine flu returns with a vengeance later this year , though officials are reluctant to make that link publicly .
“ It ’s important to public health to move forward with the regulations , ” said Christine Pearson , a spokeswoman for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
“ We need to update our quarantine regulations , and this final rule is an important step . ”
Pearson said CDC had made “ changes where appropriate ” to the 2005 proposals , but she did not specify those adjustments .
An OMB spokesman , Tom Gavin , confirmed the rules submitted by the CDC in June were in “ an interagency review process . ”
Civil liberties groups and some public health experts question the value of the effort and not just on privacy grounds — they also contend that mandatory quarantine is unlikely to be an effective tool to contain swine flu or other diseases in the modern era .
“ It does n’t surprise me that when swine flu or any other epidemic is featured prominently in the news , we see a return to quarantine and other public health regulations , ” said Christopher Calabrese of the American Civil Liberties Union , which sharply criticized the Bush - era proposal as too heavy - handed .
“ The enemy here is n’t the American people or sick people .
It ’s an illness .
...
Police officers with guns cannot make people obey a quarantine .
In order for this to work , it has to be collaborative .
They have to trust the government . ”
Thus far , the Obama administration has gotten high marks from quarantine critics , particularly for rejecting suggestions that the U.S. close its border with Mexico during the initial swine flu outbreak .
“ The current administration quite rightfully resisted those calls , ” Jennifer Nuzzo of the University of Pittsburgh ’s Center for Biosecurity said .
A report in The Washington Post on Tuesday signaled that the administration may lessen some of the more stringent measures recommended for swine flu earlier this year , such as school closures .
Analysts said the administration may want to hold new quarantine powers in reserve , for unforeseen situations or for diseases other than the flu .
POLITICO spoke with about a half - dozen health policy experts and travel industry representatives who submitted comments about the rules the Bush administration proposed in 2005 .
None of those interviewed had heard that the Obama administration was in the process of reviving the plan , though some hailed the move .
“ This is great news , ” said Paula Steib of the Association of State and Territorial Health Officials , which generally supported the 2005 proposals .
“ I do believe that the coming flu season and the prospect of a resurgence is the reason for the rushed response , ” said Georgetown law professor Lawrence Gostin .
“ I have been calling for the federal government to finalize the CDC regulations for a long time now .
They are so antiquated that they provide insufficient powers .
...
Much depends on what the final regulations actually say . ”
While quarantines are sometimes imposed by state and local officials on uncooperative patients , federal quarantine has been almost unheard of in recent decades .
Atlanta attorney Andrew Speaker was famously quarantined in 2007 for flying on international flights while infected with tuberculosis .
The last reported federal quarantine before that was in 1963 .
In recent months , American and British school groups — even New Orleans Mayor Ray Nagin — have been quarantined in China by officials targeting swine flu .
“ They ’ve gotten a lot of criticism from public health authorities , ” Nuzzo said .
In April 2003 , as severe acute respiratory syndrome spread through Asia , President George W. Bush issued an executive order adding that illness to the list of diseases that are grounds for a quarantine .
In April 2005 , when avian flu hit hard overseas , Bush listed “ influenza caused by novel or re-emergent influenza viruses that are causing , or have the potential to cause , a pandemic . ”
A variety of fearsome diseases were already subject to quarantine , including cholera , infectious tuberculosis , plague , smallpox and viral hemorrhagic fevers like Ebola .
The CDC followed that November with the proposed regulations the Obama administration is now finalizing .
Bush administration officials said their proposal would have created a new appeals process for those served with quarantine orders .
However , the proposed rules included no new judicial mechanism for review of quarantine orders .
Those who objected to being held against their will should file habeas corpus petitions in federal court , guidance accompanying those rules suggested .
Officials said the proposed regulations focused mainly on detaining small numbers of individuals .
However , the rules also discussed scenarios “ when it is necessary to provisionally quarantine a large group of persons on a very short time frame . ”
While any discussion of quarantine may stoke public fears of barbed wire camps filled with infected Americans or closures of international borders , public health experts said that sort of approach to H1N1 flu would not be effective .
“ Particularly for flu , the disease is transmitted very rapidly .
Within a few days , it ’s all over the place , ” Nuzzo said .
Critics also objected to a provision in the proposed rules that appeared to require anyone who knows that he or she has been exposed to or is suffering from a communicable illness to seek a “ travel permit ” from the director of the CDC before taking a train , a plane or even an automobile across state lines .
Agencies across the federal government are making preparations to deal with a serious flare - up of the H1N1 flu this winter .
The Food and Drug Administration is overseeing expedited production of vaccines .
And the military is considering a plan to give transportation and laboratory help to the Federal Emergency Management Agency in the event of a major outbreak , CNN reported last week .
When the swine flu first grabbed headlines earlier this year , Obama administration officials deflected all questions about quarantines .
“ Most quarantine authority is held at the local and state level , and we ’re nowhere near that sort of a decision , ” Homeland Security Secretary Janet Napolitano said at a news briefing in April .
Issuance of the new rules by the business - friendly Bush administration may have bogged down over the possible financial impact of forcing the travel industry to collect and keep more tracing data about passengers .
CDC estimated that cost at between $ 118 million and $ 425 million .
In May , the airline industry wrote to Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius , asking her to enact the new quarantine rules while delaying the data collection provisions pending further review .
An HHS representative did not respond to requests for comment on the letter .
The still - pending proposed rules from 2005 can be viewed here .
To reveal a gruesome dolphin slaughter to the world , the makers of the documentary The Cove used spy drones , cameras disguised as rocks and a lot of daring .
The movie depicts a hunt in the waters off Taiji , Japan , where at least 2,000 dolphins are killed every year , with a few caught and sold to aquariums .
The meat , containing toxic levels of mercury is sold to people , often passed off as whale meat .
Dolphin killing receives less attention than whale hunts , but many scientists say their death is every bit as tragic .
Like other cetaceans , dolphins appear capable of such high - level cognition that in some ways they might be considered people .
Their neurological systems of emotion and social communication are highly developed .
Some researchers think their high - pitched vocalizations may contain aspects of language .
They may even have names for each other .
Among the most vocal critics of dolphin hunting and capture is Ric O'Barry , who trained the animal stars of the TV show Flipper in the 1970s .
It was O'Barry who convinced National Geographic photographer Louie Psihoyos to make a film about the killing in Taiji , from which only fragmented accounts of the hunt had previously emerged .
Though the town itself is adorned with statues of dolphins , and sidewalks are embedded with tiles containing their likenesses , the killing takes place in a carefully guarded cove .
Technically it's a national park , but even Japanese citizens can't enter the park during hunting season .
" The cove is like a fortress .
It 's protected on three sides by steep cliffs .
To get in , you need to go through a natural tunnel system that 's protected by a dog and a sensor .
Ric said you 'd need a Navy SEAL team to get in there .
I said that I did n't know any Navy SEALs , but I did know Mandy - Ray Cruickshank , " said Psihoyos .
Cruickshank is one of the world 's top freedivers , able to dive 300 feet and come back up under her own power , capable of holding her breath for six minutes .
She and freediver trainer Kirk Krack joined the team , swimming into the cove at night to install and retrieve cameras .
Some of the cameras came from Kerner Optical , a spinoff of legendary special effects shop Industrial Light and magic .
They build high - definition video cameras into rocks so realistic " that when we went back to retrieve the rocks , we had trouble finding them again , " said Psihos .
An electronics expert from the Canadian Air Force built a fleet of unmanned , remote - controlled drones to carry cameras above the hunt .
Military - grade heat - sensing cameras were used to track the movements of guards .
The cameras were so cutting - edge that manufacturer Sony had n't yet released the software necessary to pull data off the hard drives and edit it .
The team hid the drives in a hotel air conditioning duct , and within a day of retrieving each one had runners take them to Tokyo or Osaka and send them out of the country .
In the end , only 90 seconds or so of the slaughter itself is shown in the film .
" For me , the most telling violence comes when the violence is over , " said Psihoyos .
" When the dolphins die , their bodies sink .
Divers are sent to retrieve them .
Afterwards you see them smoking by the campfire with a blood - red sea behind them .
There 's something so banal about it .
They just had a hand in that atrocity , and life goes on .
That 's the most revealing part . "
The Cove is now in wide release in the United States .
The next dolphin hunting season will begin in Japan in September .

Under a high magnification of 12,483X , this scanning electron micrograph ( SEM ) depicted spores from the Sterne strain of Bacillus anthracis bacteria .
Anthrax may be the baddest bacteria on the block , but anthrax gets sick , too .
Just like you , bacteria get the bug , viruses called bacteriophages .
Bacteriophages are just small viruses , tiny and elegant packages of genes that inject themselves into the machinery of cells , using them to churn out more viruses .
" Every time we open up anthrax , there are viruses inside , " says microbiologist Vincent Fischetti of Rockefeller University in New York .
" What everyone else thought , " Fischetti says , was that these viruses preyed on bacteria , like colds prey on people , making them weaker .
But in 2006 , Fischer and his student Raymond Schuch found that anthrax actually weathers the assault of a natural antibiotic better when it 's infected with a virus .
" That led us to wonder how this deadly bacteria exists when it is outside humans , " Fischetti said .
Anthrax is found naturally in the soil , packed into spores in dirt , waiting to be eaten , by grazing livestock .
Once inside a creature it spreads , releasing toxins that often kill their host , and deposit more spores in the soil , dormant , waiting for the next victim .
Or so we thought .
" Actually the story turns out to be a lot more complicated , " Schuch says .
A great deal of research has focused on anthrax after it was used in 2001 to kill five people in mailings linked by the Justice Department to a United States Army Medical Research Institute for Infectious Diseases vaccine researcher , Bruce Ivins , who committed suicide last year .
But most of the research focuses on anthrax infections , not on how it spends most of its time in the wild .
In a paper out in the journal PloS One , Fischetti and Schuch looked at how infection with nine bacteriophages affected anthrax , compared to uninfected anthrax , in the soil .
" Infection drives a series of changes , " they write after a series of experiments : • They grow in " flat , large , and opaque " colonies , unlike " small , white " uninfected ones .
•
Infected spores have double - thick walls that stay within colonies instead of sprouting rapidly .
•
Infected spores " colonize " the guts of earthworms much more successfully .
" The relationship is completely synergistic .
They use each other to survive " Fischetti says .
The bacteriophages help anthrax survive in the wild , in turn prolonging the existence of the viruses , which continue to shed from the infected earthworms .
They are partners in crime .
The implications for biology are significant , Fischetti suggests .
" It 's not enough to sequence the genes of a bacteria to know what it does .
You have to look at the phages as well . "
Other researchers are catching on as well , looking at slightly different bugs .
The viruses in the PloS One papers were " lysogenic , " meaning they integrate their genes into their host 's cells and reproduce when those cells reproduce .
Another paper out this week , in the journal Science , led by Michael Vos of the United Kingdom 's University of Oxford , to look at soil bacteriophages of the more common variety , called " lytic , " that sneak into their host 's genes , but churn out so many copies of themselves that they burst open host cells , destroying them .
In the Science study , Vos and colleagues show that lytic bacteriophages spark an evolutionary war of adaptation between viruses and bacteria .
Lytic viruses within an inch of a bacteria in the soil will soon develop characteristics over a few generations that better enable their ability to infect bacteria which " suggests that phages are ahead of the bacteria in the co-evolutionary arms race . "
Vos and colleagues suggest these deadly lytic bacteriophages must play a big role in the survival of bacteria , as well .
" In a sense they verify what we have found with anthrax , " Fischetti says , " that these interactions occur at a significant level for most organisms in the soil .
While they speculate that these interactions could play a role in bacterial survival , our data shows in detail how these interactions actually change the organism , anthrax in our case , for survival in the environment . "
Most remarkably , the PloS One paper confirms a hypothesis first put forward by the pioneering scientists Louis Pasteur , who speculated 130 years ago that anthrax survives in earthworms .
" We 're really following in the footsteps of Pasteur , " Schuch says .
" Nobody thought to follow it up until now . "

After lunch at a typical Texas restaurant , our buses trundled out to Sienna Plantation , one of more than two dozen master - planned communities in Fort Bend County alone .
Fort Bend is one of ten counties in the Houston meto area .
Covering 10,500 acres , Sienna Plantation includes churches , schools , shops , parks , and single - and multi-family homes .
The developer , Johnson Development Company , purchased the land , built levies to protect the area from floods , subdivided it , installed utilities , and sells parcels to builders , the local school district , and other companies .
Johnson does not build any homes itself .
A map of Sienna Plantation .
Click for a larger view .
Unlike parts of Houston , Sienna Plantation has separated the various uses .
Multifamily housing ( orange ) is close to the commercial and retail centers ( red ) — “ you need multifamily to support the retail ” said our tour guide .
The single - family neighborhoods are themselves separated by the size of the homes : one neighborhood might have 2,000 - to 2,500 - square - foot homes , another 2,500 to 3,000 , etc.
Johnson sells lots only to home builders except for the half - acre lots in Bees Creek ( center above ) , which are available to buyers who want custom homes that still must be built by one of Johnson ’s approved home builders .
This home is probably selling for about $ 180,000 .
A price list indicate that homes start in “ the $ 160s , ” as realtors say , and go up to $ 2 million or so .
Basic homes cost about $ 80 a square foot , roughly half as much as in Oregon and less than a quarter as much as most of California .
Deed restrictions require , among other things , that exteriors not use wood siding — which seems strange to this Northwesterner where nearly all homes are made of wood .
This is probably somewhat more expensive , but two - story , four - bedroom , 2 - 1/ 2 bath homes with 2,300 square feet are available for as little as $ 185,000 .
To provide sewer , water , and other utilities , Johnson created several municipal utility districts , which repay the capital costs out of annual assessments on the homes .
Johnson also added a deed restriction to all homes requirng that one - half percent of sale and resale prices be dedicated to a community services foundation .
In its first eight years , this foundation spent about $ 3.3 million , about two - thirds of which went for community parks , and the rest to things like schools and help for children of local families with serious diseases .
Sienna includes 36 parks and playgrounds , including a 12 - acre water park , baseball and soccer fields , and many small playgrounds like this one .
Johnson also created a Sienna homeowners association — in fact , several : one for each local neighborhood and an umbrella for the entire area .
Until the development is complete , however , Johnson itself maintains controlling votes on the association boards .
This is to protect it from residents who may want to pull up the drawbridge before the area is built out .
When it is complete or nearly complete , Johnson will quietly hand over control to the homeowners .
School had just let out when we passed by one of the five schools in Sienna .
While home prices are much lower , property tax rates in the Houston area are higher , especially when the municipal utility district assessments are counted .
Most Sienna homeowners pay about 3.5 percent of assessed value plus about $ 800 a year to the homeowners association .
According to census data published by the National Association of Home Builders , Fort Bend County residents pay about twice the tax rates as homeowners in Oregon .
But since a home of equal value is twice as big in Texas , effectively people pay about the same taxes for similarly sized homes .
The Fort Bend Parkway .
After finishing up our tour of Sienna , we took the Fort Bend Parkway , one of the region ’s many toll roads , back to Houston .
This 6.2 - mile , four - lane highway required just over a year to build and opened in 2004 at a cost of $ 60 million .
That ’s less than $ 2.5 million per lane mile , including on - and off - ramps , over - and underpasses , and toll facilities .
By comparison , $ 60 million would barely get you one mile of light rail and less than a mile of heavy rail .
The toll for the 6.2 miles was $ 2 , even for our full - sized buses .
If I lived in Sienna , I am not sure I would ever want to go to Houston itself .
But if I did , it would be nice to know I could get most of the way without facing any congestion .
I ’ll provide more commentary in future posts .

In astronomical terms , the collision happened relatively recently
A Nasa space telescope has found evidence of a high - speed collision between two burgeoning planets orbiting a young star .
Astronomers say the cosmic smash - up is similar to the one that formed our Moon some four billion years ago , when a Mars - sized object crashed into Earth .
In this case , two rocky bodies are thought to have slammed into one another in the last few thousand years .
Details are to be published in the Astrophysical Journal .
The collision involved one object that was at least as big as our Moon and another that was at least as big as Mercury .
The impact destroyed the smaller body , vaporising huge amounts of rock and flinging plumes of hot lava into space .
Infrared detectors on Nasa 's Spitzer Space Telescope were able to pick up the signatures of the vaporised rock , along with fragments of hardened lava , known as tektites .
Melted glass
" This collision had to be huge and incredibly high - speed for rock to have been vaporised and melted , " said lead author Carey M Lisse of the Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory at Laurel in Maryland , US .
" This is a really rare and short - lived event , critical in the formation of Earth - like planets and moons .
We 're lucky to have witnessed one not long after it happened . "
Dr Lisse and his team observed a star called HD 172555 , which is about 12 million years old and situated about 100 light - years away in the far southern constellation Pavo ( the Peacock ) .
The astronomers used a spectrograph instrument on Spitzer to look for the fingerprints of chemicals in the spectrum of light from the star .
The researchers identified large amounts of amorphous silica - melted glass .
Silica can be found on Earth in obsidian rocks and tektites .
Obsidian is black , shiny volcanic glass .
Tektites are hardened chunks of lava thought to have formed when meteorites hit the Earth .
Large quantities of orbiting silicon monoxide gas were also detected , created when much of the rock was vaporised .
In addition , the astronomers found rocky rubble that was probably flung out from the planetary wreck .
The two bodies must have been travelling at a speed of at least 10 km / s ( about 22,400 mph ) relative to one other before the collision .
Dark disturbance : the object that hit Jupiter left a scar
Rocky planets form and grow in size by colliding and sticking together .
This process merges their cores and causes some of their surfaces to be shed .
Though things have settled down in the Solar System today , impacts still occur , as was observed last month when a small comet or asteroid struck Jupiter .
" The collision that formed our Moon would have been tremendous , enough to melt the surface of Earth , " said co-author Geoff Bryden of Nasa 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory ( JPL ) in Pasadena , California .
" Debris from the collision most likely settled into a disc around Earth that eventually coalesced to make the Moon .
This is about the same scale of impact we 're seeing with Spitzer . "
" We do n't know if a moon will form or not , but we know a large rocky body 's surface was red hot , warped and melted . "
The Spitzer telescope has witnessed the dusty aftermath of large impacts before , but did not find evidence for rock that had been melted and vaporised .
Instead , large amounts of dust , gravel , and boulder - sized rubble were observed , indicating collisions that were slower - paced .

Among this week ’s new videos from TED , was a talk given by Elaine Morgan – the chief promoter of the Aquatic Ape Hypothesis ( AAH ) .
The AAH was first formulated by Alister Hardy and is the idea that human evolution went through an aquatic stage , which in turn explains many of the features of the human physiology .
For anybody with a poor understanding of evolutionary biology the AAH arguments can seem quite compelling .
Instead of repeating the numerous reasons why the AAH fails ( Jim Moore has an entire website dedicated to this ) , I wish to address some of the specific arguments made in this video .
Morgan starts off my stating that " … there 's one aspect of this story which they [ evolutionists ] have thrown no light on and they seem anxious to skirt around and step over it and talk about something else .
So I 'm going to talk about it .
It 's the question of why are we so different from the chimpanzees ? " .
Either Morgan has not been reading the hundreds of research papers that have addressed these important questions or she is trying to hoodwink her audience .
Palaeoanthropologists and primatologists have long recognised the value of studying human and chimp differences in order to understand our shared evolutionary history .
In fact , it is impossible to talk about functional anatomy and phylogenetic history in humans without reference to our closest extinct and living hominin relatives .
She continues : " Yet when you look at the phenotypes .
There 's a chimp , there 's a man .
They 're astoundingly different .
No resemblance at all . "
I am hearing this correctly ?
No resemblance at all ?
Even a five year old can see the striking similarities between chimpanzees and humans .
To suggest that there is “ no resemblance at all ” is laughable .
It was the similarities of humans to other non-human primates that led Charles Darwin to argue for common ancestry between humans and the great apes .
Even without the fossil record and the unambiguous molecular evidence , the morphological similarities alone would be enough to suggest a shared common ancestry of chimps and humans .
Throughout the talk she constantly refers to humans as naked , as if to suggest we are hairless .
One need only look at a shirtless Alec Baldwin , Robin Williams or Andy Garcia to know this is not the case .
While it is true that humans are less hairy than the rest of our primate kin there are far more compelling hypotheses to explain our lack of hair ( thermoregulation , defence against parasites or sexual selection ) .
She claims that hairlessness is an aquatic trait when in fact most aquatic / semi-acquatic mammals are in fact hairy .
Otters , polar bears , seals , and walruses are but some examples that spring to mind .
Regarding the failed savannah hypothesis of bipedalism Morgan has this to say : " What do scientists do when a paradigm fails … carry on as though nothing had ever happened …
If they have n't got a paradigm they can't ask the questions …
The only other option open to them is to stop asking the questions .
So that is what they have done now .
That is why you do n't hear them talking about it .
" When paradigms fail science marches on .
When was the last time you heard a scientist defending the merits of Lamarckism , psychoanalysis and phrenology ?
Morgan is correct that the savannah hypothesis does n’t weigh up against the evidence but she mistakenly claims that the anthropologists have n’t let go of this idea .
The savannah hypothesis was formulated in a time when there was a dearth of palaeoecological data for the most important African archaeological sites .
As more data came in , anthropologists changed their models correspondingly .
No serious anthropologist still adheres to the savannah hypothesis .
Morgan chooses to ignore this fact , instead preferring the easier route of attacking a strawman .
In the references section below , you will find just a spattering of the work anthropologists have been doing on palaeoecological reconstructions of the environments occupied by our forebearers .
These papers address the very questions Morgan asserts that scientists have stopped asking .
Does she not read the anthropological literature or does she just choose to ignore it ?
She implies that because the savannah hypothesis is false it somehow offers support to the AAH .
In fact , the consensus opinion suggests that neither savannah nor aquatic environments were very important in the early stages of human evolution , but rather our hominin ancestors exploited wood and forest habitats .
A number of anthropologists have proposed an arboreal origin of hominin bipedality ( Crompton 2008 ; Pickerford 2006 ; Senut 2003 , 2006 ) .
In fact , the best known human ancestor Lucy shows clear arboreal adaptations .
Morgans proceeds by stating that " there is only one circumstance in which they always , all of them [ non human primates ] , walk on two legs and that is when they are wading through water . "
Contrary to Morgan ’s claim , the data have shown apes to be bipedal more often on land than in the water .
She follows this up by saying that the fat in humans is similar to that seen in aquatic mammals .
Humans have a similar number of fat cells compared with other primates .
The increased subcutaneous fat seen in humans is most likely a result of diet rather than an evolutionary adaptation .
Non-human primate obesity is well documented , particularly in primates kept in captivity ( Videan 2007 ; Altmann et al 1993 ; Kemnitz et al 1989 ; Schwartz et al 1993 ) .
Moreover , the distribution of fat in humans runs contrary to need aquatic mammals have for streamlining .
Ten minutes into the talk she states that " the only creatures that have got conscious control of their breath are the diving animals and the birds " .
Humans are not the only non-aquatic mammal which can hold its breath .
Various monkeys , for instance , can and do hold their breath , as well as dogs .
Finally , she asserts that " we are streamlined . "
Humans are anything but streamlined .
Our motion in the water is generally quite wasteful .
Ask any swimming coach .
Fish have a fusiform shape ( tapered at both ends ) , which is ideal for moving through the water with the least amount of resistance .
Let ’s put this into perspective .
The sailfish records speeds of up to 116 km / hr ( 72 mph ) , while Michael Phelps can average a measly about 6.5 km / hr ( 4 mph ) on a good day !
Our body shape is a consequence of our adaptation to bipedalism , the requirements of childbirth in women , sexual dimorphism and sexual selection .
While I generally enjoy listening to the speakers at TED , I think this is an idea NOT worth spreading .

Converting digital images to B&W is a bit like the Swiss fondue recipe : everyone has a different version and each person is convinced to have the best .
I previously blogged about the subject with a “ blind comparison ” between different methods – with the comparison ’s result .
Now during the recent Libre Graphics Meeting , there was a short talk ( I do n’t remember the speaker ) about “ What ’s new in GIMP 2.6 ? ” and one of the hotness is the very explicitly named c2g feature , conveniently buried in the GEGL operations ( sub - ) menu .
And guess what ?
c2g is a black and white converter … maybe the ultimate one .
The other good thing about conferences is that you get to actually meet people , so I had a chance to listen to some more explanations from Øyvind Kolås ( aka Pippin ) , c2 g ’s author .
I say listen since I was the least technical guy around the table so there was not much talking on my side ; which is also why I hope this blog post is accurate – please correct me if someone knows better .
The idea behind c2g is to convert each pixel to B &W using an optimal white balance : the black and white points are calculated for each pixel according to its surrounding , giving the closer pixels more weight ( and following a gaussian curve ) .
And basically this mimics the way our human eye perceives the image – how we perceive a color ( or grey nuance ) depends not only on its value , but on its environment .
You probably came across this optical illusion : both greys in the middle are of the same density ( value ) but one is perceived clearer than the other because it is surrounded by a darker tone than the other one .
Now if I process the image with c2g , here is what I get :
See the idea ?
The absolute value of the greys in the center are “ corrected ” to “ fit ” our perception .
By the way , this is with every c2g value left as default , except samples set to 10 – resulting in a longer processing time , but less noise .
The best way I would describe what c2g does is masking done automagically right for maximum contrast .
For the purpose of illustration ( rather than for artistic purpose ) take this photo :
And this is what you get with c2g – default parameters except a radius set to 280 for a more dramatic effect on a small image :
Just for comparison ’s sake here is the Luminosity ( from HSL ) :
Øyvind has a comparison between several more B&W conversion methods ( including c2g , obviously ) .
What do you think ?
If c2g is not the ultimate B &W converter , it is darn close to it , if you ask me .
By the way , here is the comparison ’s image processed with c2g :

One girl , twelve cups
Due to there being an unprecedented twelve coffee cups needing to be washed in the sink at work , it is understandable that Shannon would be outraged by this intrusion on her Facebook and looking out the window time .
Though kitchen duties may be an expected part of her role , there 's no reason why everyone should n't reschedule work / client commitments and do their part to ensure Shannon 's social networking and window time is not interrupted .

ShannonMonday 17 August 2009 10.12amStaffCoffee cupsHiThere was twelve coffee cups left in the sink this morning .
Could everyone please wash their coffee cups after using them .
Thanks , ShanDavid ThorneMonday 17 August 2009 10.19amShannonRe : Coffee cupsMorning Shannon , My apologies .
Those coffee cups were mine .
I have a busy day scheduled so decided to have all of my coffee breaks at the one time this morning rather than taking separate breaks throughout the day .
I 'm experiencing severe heart palpitations but am also typing at four hundred and seventy words per minute so should be able to knock off early .
Regards , DavidShannonMonday 17 August 2009 10.31 amDavid ThorneRe : Re : Coffee cupsI was n'tt saying they were all your coffee cups I was just saying that I shouldnt have to wash twelve coffee cups when I do n't even drink coffee .
People should wash their own coffee cups or at least take it in turns to wash them .
ShanDavid ThorneMonday 17 August 2009 10.42amShannonRe : Re : Re : Coffee cupsShannon , You raise a valid and not at all uninteresting point .
Perhaps you could construct some kind of chart .
A roster system would enable us to work in an environment free of dirty coffee cups and put an end to any confusion regarding who the dirty coffee cup responsibility lies with .
DavidShannonMonday 17 August 2009 1.08 pmStaffKitchen RosterHi everyone .
I discussed a kitchen roster with David and feel it would be fair if we took it in turns to do the dishes .
I put the roster in the kitchen above the sink so everyone can remember .
Thanks , ShanDavid ThorneMonday 17 August 2009 1.22 pmShannonColour coded coffee cup cleaning chartShannon , I notice that you have colour coded the coffee cup cleaning chart .
While I appreciate the creative effort that has gone into this roster , the light salmon colour you have chosen for my name is rather effeminate .
While I 'm sure you were n't inferring anything , I 'd appreciate you rectifying this .
Would it be possible to swap colours with Thomas as he has quite a nice dusty blue ?
Thank you , DavidShannonMonday 17 August 2009 2.17 pmStaffUpdated kitchen rosterHi .
I changed David 's colour to blue on the kitchen roster .
Thomas is now green .
ShanThomasMonday 17 August 2009 2.24 pmDavid ThorneWhat the fuck ?
What the fuck is this email from Shannon ?
I 'm not doing a fucking kitchen roster .
Was this your idea ?
ThomasDavid ThorneMonday 17 August 2009 2.38 pmThomasShannonRe :
What the fuck ?
Thomas , do you feel it's fair that Shannon should have to wash everyone 's coffee cups ?
Apparently this morning there were twelve coffee cups in the sink .
I was going to schedule a staff board meeting this afternoon to discuss the issue but luckily Shannon has prepared a colour coded coffee cup cleaning chart for us rendering a staff meeting unnecessary .
We should all thank Shannon for taking the initiative and creating a system that will empower us to efficiently schedule client meetings and work commitments around our designated coffee cup cleaning duties .
If at any stage our rostered coffee cup cleaning commitments coincide with work requirements , we can simply hold the client meeting in the kitchen .
We can wash while the clients dry .
Today it may only be twelve coffee cups but tomorrow it could be several plates and a spoon .
Then where would we be ?
DavidThomasMonday 17 August 2009 2.56 pmShannonKitchen stuffShannon , I do n't need a chart telling me when to wash dishes .
I 'm not going to stop in the middle of writing proposals to wash coffee cups .
David is being a fuckwit .
I only use the orange coffee cup and I always rinse it out after I use it .
If we have clients here and they use coffee cups then it is expected that you wash them as part of your job .
ThomasLillianMonday 17 August 2009 3.06 pmThomas , DavidRe : Kitchen stuff
What 's this kitchen roster thing ?
Did you agree to this ?
David ThorneMonday 17 August 2009 3.09 pmShannonRescheduling coffee cup dutiesShannon , I realise I 'm rostered for coffee cup cleaning duty this afternoon but I 've not had time to familiarise myself with correct coffee cup cleaning requirements .
I 'm happy to reschedule my meetings tomorrow to undertake a training session on dish washing detergent location and washcloth procedures with you if you have the time .
I also feel it would be quite helpful if prior to the training session you prepared some kind of Powerpoint presentation .
Possibly with graphs .
Will I need to bring my own rubber gloves or will these be provided ?
DavidShannonMonday 17 August 2009 3.20 pmDavid ThorneRe : Rescheduling coffee cup dutiesWhatever .
Marriage rates in different countries can be linked to views on who is responsible for doing the housework .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
An Oxford study suggests that if you want to settle down , your chances of getting married or living with someone are probably highest in Great Britain , the Scandinavian countries and the United States .
According to the study , men in those countries are more likely than their Australian counterparts to do the household chores and thereby make marriage a more attractive option to their nation ’s women .
According to an Oxford economist , marriage and cohabiting rates in developed countries can be linked to attitudes towards the roles of men and women , and views on who is responsible for doing the housework and looking after the children .
Both men and women have shown they are more likely to want a live - in relationship with the opposite sex if they think their partner will do a share of the housework and childcare duties .
The study constructs an ‘ egalitarian index ’ of 12 developed countries , based on responses to questionnaires about gender , housework and childcare responsibilities .
Norway and Sweden top the egalitarian index , with Great Britain in third place , followed by the United States .
At the bottom of the index are Japan , Germany , and Austria , with Australia languishing as the least egalitarian .
Data about the number of women in partnerships was then compared against the index .
Women of similar age and educational background were compared across the participating countries to see if their country ’s rating on the egalitarian index bore any relation to whether they were living with a man or not .
Other controlling factors , such as female unemployment , were taken account of .
The study found that women living in less egalitarian countries were between 20 and 50 per cent less likely to be living with a man than comparable women living in a more egalitarian country .
For instance , the findings would predict that the average British woman was 8.5 percentage points more likely than a similar Australian woman to be in a live - in relationship .
Study author Dr Almudena Sevilla - Sanz , an ESRC - funded researcher at the Centre for Time Use Research at Oxford University , concludes that women living in countries with the highest proportion of egalitarian men are more likely to marry or live with a man .
The study also suggests that a more egalitarian woman in any country is less likely than a less egalitarian woman to set up home with a man because , everything else being equal , most men would choose a woman who they can rely on to do housework and look after the children .
While egalitarian men seem to be viewed as a better bet by women , egalitarian women are seen as a less safe bet by men .
Dr Sevilla - Sanz said : ‘ In egalitarian countries you might , in principle , expect to see women preferring to remain single rather than face the prospect of spending more time doing household chores .
However , this study shows that in egalitarian countries there is less social stigma attached to men doing what was traditionally women ’s work .
' For instance , if paternity leave is the social norm , more men take it .
This leads to men in egalitarian societies taking on more of a domestic role so the likelihood of forming a harmonious household becomes greater , resulting in a higher proportion of couples setting up households in these countries .
‘ If developed countries want to look at why the birth rate in their country is falling , we need to focus on the drivers for whether couples decide to live together and start a family .
It seems to show what couples ask " Will I be better off ? " .
Women in less egalitarian countries are saying " No " .
Countries with a low birth rate face the challenge of a shrinking workforce in coming decades with questions about who will pay for public services and social support . ’
The representative sample of 13,500 men and women , aged between 20 - 45 years old from each of the 12 countries , was taken from the same survey carried out in 1994 and 2002 as part of the International Social Survey Program .

It is evident the White House is trying to regain hold of its messaging on health care , as we saw President Obama barn - storming the country this week hosting several campaign - style town halls .
With the continued chatter regarding former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin 's discerning claims on her Facebook page that Obama 's health care reform proposals would promote " death panels " for end - of - life counseling , the fallout this week has proved the health care debate has gotten out of control .
Now , the White House is fighting back its critics and recent false claims that have surfaced .
It recently introduced a new Web site to debunk the myths and misinformation that have floated around lately regarding the Obama administration 's health care reform proposals .
Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius , Obama 's top Cabinet official in charge of health reform , appeared this morning on ABC's " This Week With George Stephanopoulos " to clear up the falsities surrounding current health care proposals .
In regards to recent claims made by Palin and other conservatives , Sebelius said it's " horrific " twisting of facts to say that " death panels " would be part of Obama 's proposed health care overhaul .
" I think it 's really horrific that some opponents of the health reform bill have used painful personal moments to scare people about what is in the bill , " Sebelius told guest - host Jake Tapper on " This Week . "
Sebelius criticized opponents of the Democrats ' plans for health reform for using scare tactics to try to derail an overhaul saying , " Nothing could be farther from the truth .
" If anything , [ senior citizens ] should welcome the fact that doctors would have a payment provided to sit down with family members if they choose and have a discussion , " she said .
Sebelius noted that the end - of - life provision would " probably be off the table " in final health care reform legislation .
It is likely that come this fall , Congress will push a more modest legislation on health care reform , such as legislation currently being debated in the Senate , settling for what some are aiming for as a " half a loaf , " or lowering expectations on what is actually achievable in passing health care reform .
End -of - Life Debate Gets Personal
On " This Week , " Sebelius brought up a personal connection to end - of - life decisions , mentioning her experiences with her own mother , who spent 10 weeks in three different hospitals before she died .
" I think end - of - life decisions are very , very personal and very difficult for family members , very difficult for people to confront , " Sebelius said .
" What every family wants is good information and the ability to make a decision that suits their loved ones the best way . "
Recent talk about " death panels " have even prompted President Obama to speak out about his own family experience this week during Saturday night 's town hall in Grand Junction , Colo .
The president said , " I just lost my grandmother last year .
I know what it 's like to watch somebody you love , who 's aging , deteriorate , and have to struggle with that .
So the notion that somehow I ran for public office , or members of Congress are in this so that they can go around pulling the plug on grandma ?
I mean , when you start making arguments like that , that 's simply dishonest . "
Democratic Sen. Arlen Specter said in an interview on " This Week " that he supports Americans ' right to organize , but warned that recent town hall ruckus from critics of the Democrats ' health care proposals are not representative of the public 's view on the issue .
" I think we have to bear in mind that although those people need to be heard and have a right to be heard that they are not really representative of America , in my opinion , " Specter said on ABC 's " This Week . "
He noted , " We have to be careful here not to let those town meetings make the scene that influences what we do on health policy . "
Town Halls : A Wide Represention of America
Utah Republican Sen. Orrin
Hatch was quick to disagree with Specter , saying the heat surrounding town halls recently represent people who are " up in arms " with anger .
During a head - to - head debate between the two senators on " This Week , " Hatch complimented Specter on his handling of the town halls but said recent uprising was genuine .
" Having listened to Arlen , I have to say that I thought Arlen handled his town meetings very , very well , " said Hatch .
" I disagree with Arlen that they 're not representative of the American people .
I think they are .
I 've found people just up in arms everywhere I 've gone on health care . "
Specter has been in the crossfires this week during town hall debates in his own district .
He pointed out recent comments by John Podesta , president and CEO of the Center for American Progress , referring to efforts from critics to make this the president 's ' Waterloo ' issue .
" We also can't allow these kinds of town hall meetings to dominate the political process , " Hatch said .
" That would be destructive of what we need to do to figure out what is the best approach . "
White House Is " Off the Mark "
Democratic strategist and ABC contributor Donna Brazile criticized the White House 's messaging center today during the roundtable discussion on " This Week " , saying " the administration has been " off the mark " for several weeks " but added that " there 's signs now that they have gotten control of their message and with this op - ed , but more importantly with the town hall meetings . "
Ed Gillespie , former White House counselor to President George W. Bush , joined Brazile , Ron Brownstein of the National Journal and the Washington Post 's Anne Kornblut .
Kornblut said she agrees that the White House lost its control of messaging , especially with the media attention former vice presidential Republican nominee Palin received from her posting about " death panels " on her Facebook page .
" At the end of the day , they were responding to her , not the other way around , " Kornblut said .
Sarah Palin May ' Contribute to Her Long - Term Marginalization '
The National Journal 's Brownstein also agreed with Kornblut about her assessment of Palin , but went even further .
He said , " The basic problem Sarah Palin has as a political figure is that she is kind of the king or queen of a narrowing island and this does that further . "
Brownstein went on to say , " I think in many ways this will contribute to her long - term marginalization as a potential president if not a potential leader of the Republican Party . "
In response to Sarah Palin and her claims of " death panels , " Brazile quoted John Adams , saying , " Facts are stubborn things . "
She went on to say that Gov. Palin was for end - of life counseling before she was against it , referring to a proclamation she signed as governor back in April of 2008 to encourage Alaskans to " seek out counseling services for these important decisions . "
As a sign that the conservatives may be losing its sight on " death panels , " Republican strategist Gillespie distanced himself from his party and said it is inaccurate terminology .
" I agree that characterizing the panels that are n't in there in terms of determining how to make spending decision on care , that there is a legitimate concern about those , " he said .
" I agree that they should n't be characterized as death panels . "
Hungary has called on Slovakia to recind new legislation which will make the use of Hungarian within the Slovakian public services punishable by a fine of up to 5000 euros .
The legislation is due to come into force on 1st September .
MEP

Ethnic Hungarians make up 10 % of Slovakia ’s population , and the move follows accusations of state - fuelled discrimination against them .
Slovakian premier Robert Fico rebuffed critisim however saying that Slovakia ’s government wiould not be “ pushed around and blackmailed by the Hungarian Parliament ” .
Meawhile in Brussels Hungarian lawyer and Adam Kosa ( who is profoundly deaf and uses sign language ) spoke out in defence of linguistic freedom , saying that everyone should have the right to use their own language – even sign language for deaf people .
His comments were warmly received by his fellows .
If one were asked to prescribe the fundamental condition for a good world , it would be : peace and freedom for all , where " freedom " means personal autonomy and mental liberation from prejudice , superstition , ignorance and fear .
Cynics will no doubt think this a saccharine sentiment merely , if only on the grounds that it is unattainable and that one had better stick to the realities of a world in which the majority of people are trapped in economic and intellectual prisons made by history , perpetuated and promoted by demagogues and the greedy and powerful .
The cynics are of course right about the realities , but that does not mean one should shrug one 's shoulders and capitulate .
There is something one can do to fight back , by taking part in the battle that underlies it all : the battle ( to put it in Voltaire 's terms ) between those who seek the truth and those who claim to have it .
On one side are those who inquire , examine , experiment , research , propose ideas and subject them to scrutiny , change their minds when shown to be wrong and live with uncertainty while placing reliance on the collective , self - critical , responsible and rigorous use of reason and observation to further the quest for knowledge .
On the other side are those who espouse a belief system or ideology which pre-packages all the answers , who have faith in it , who trust the authorities , priests and prophets , and who either think that the hows and whys of the universe are explained to satisfaction by their faith , or smugly embrace ignorance .
Note that although the historical majority of these latter are the epigones of one or another religion , they also include the followers of such ideologies as Marxism and Stalinism – which are also all - embracing monolithic ownerships of the Great Truth to which everyone must sign up on pain of punishment , and on whose behalf their zealots are prepared to kill and die .
If anyone does not know how to pluck from history and the contemporary world examples of these opposing mindsets and their operation then he is either deaf , dumb , blind and illiterate – or he is one of the creatures of faith .
In the aftermath of the Reformation in the 16th century , Ignatius of Loyola founded the Jesuit Order as an army of defence against the attack on the One True Church .
The Jesuits saw that the reformers had learning and intelligence on their side ; they were translating the Bible into vernacular tongues , and encouraging lay people to read it , and when laymen did so they could see that the doctrines and practices of the Roman church were a mountain of rubbish .
The Jesuits aimed to be an army of very smart casuists and propagandists , skilful in rhetoric and argument , trained to counter the reformers ' charges , not interested in truth but in Catholicism 's tendentious version of it .
It is said that the ignorant are condemned to repeat history , but it is equally true that those who know history can repeat it on purpose .
In the US the proponents of intelligent design and creationism have taken a large leaf out of Loyola 's book of strategy , and are training a new breed of jesuitical defenders of faith against the onslaught of science .
Only look at the exam set by creationist William Dembski for his Intelligent Design and Christian Apologetics course at Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary .
The Final exam questions are as follows ( and can be seen here ) :
1 . You are a panelist at the premier showing of Richard Dawkins 's BBC production debunking religion titled " The Root of All Evil ? " Richard Dawkins is there on the podium with you .
After the showing of this program , you are asked to present a brief response .
Throughout the program , Dawkins emphasises that evolutionary theory is confirmed by overwhelming evidence whereas religious belief is as a matter of blind , unthinking faith .
Challenge him in your response on both points : spend half of your response showing that evolution is not nearly as overwhelmingly confirmed as Dawkins makes out ; also , indicate how , at least when it comes to the Christian faith , religious belief can be well - supported evidentially ( eg indicate lines of evidence supporting the resurrection and the reliability of the Scriptures ) .
2 . You are an expert witness in the Dover case .
You 've been asked to summarise why you think intelligent design is a fully scientific theory .
Do so here .
Sketch out ID 's method of design detection and then show how it applies ( or could apply ) to biological systems .
Further , indicate how ID is testable : what evidence would confirm ID and what evidence would disconfirm ID ?
3 . Barbara Forrest and Paul Gross have characterised intelligent design as part of a vast rightwing conspiracy to undermine our democratic institutions by substituting religious dogma for scientific theory .
Accordingly , they see intelligent design as part of a " Wedge Strategy " .
Briefly recount the history of the " Wedge " and indicate why Forrest and Gross may be wrong to paint it in conspiratorial terms .
Is the " Wedge " a legitimate cultural movement ?
Explain .
4 . You 've been assigned to teach six Sunday school lessons on intelligent design over six consecutive Sundays .
Each lesson is an hour and fifteen minutes .
Outline how you would conduct these lessons .
What would you have people read ?
In what order ?
What would you present ?
What would you want participants to take away at the end of the six weeks ?
As this shows , the training at the seminary is aimed at producing infantry for a religious war against science and reason ; proof of this , and in Dembski's own words , lies in another of his exam questions for the same course :
You are the Templeton Foundation 's new program director and are charged with overseeing its programs and directing its funds .
Sketch out a 20 - year plan for defeating scientific materialism and the evolutionary worldview it has fostered if you had $ 50,000,000 per year in current value to do so .
What sorts of programs would you institute ?
How would you spend the money ?
Apart from the interesting aside on the Templeton Foundation , which exists to keep religion confused with and implicated in science , this makes as clear as day the tendentious purpose of an " education " at the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary .
When the faithful of any faith win the doors are open to horrors ranging from Muslims killing Christians in Gojra , women being whipped for wearing trousers in Sudan , Sunnis blowing up dozens of Shias in Iraq , oppressive theocracies , reactionary social policies , prejudice against gays and women , pogroms against Jews , slaughter of kulaks , starvation of millions as a result of ideological nostrums such as collectivisation , wars , communities separated by walls in Israel - Palestine and Ulster – the litany seems endless .
Someone once said " by their works ye shall know them " .
Indeed .
Do not venture the fig - leaf of charitable works – the non-zealous do these too , and for better motives .
The true contrast is with antibiotics , surgery , television , lighting and heating , air travel – the litany is equally endless .
And again , by their fruits we know them .
Do not venture the canard that science produces atom bombs and mustard gas , as if mentioning them justified the atrocities committed by faith on the bodies and minds of multitudes , for these applications of science are the result of political and ideological decisions about how the findings of science are to be used .
Scientists do not start wars with each other over different theories of nitrogen fixation or whether black holes or boson stars lie at the heart of galaxies .
Theologians , however , have committed many murders over the word " and " in the formula " the father and the son " : if you want a lesson in lunacy , go and find out why ; it makes all my points for me .
To summarise : the battle for peace and freedom is a battle about mindsets .
The battle lines are clear .
It is fought on many fronts : against faith - based schooling , against the overweening privilege accorded religious lobbies in society , and in the agora of public opinion .
It would be easy to take the next step of showing that the mindset which looks for and tests the facts rather than shores up ancient edifices of authority is likely to make the world a fairer one economically and in power relations too .
But that discussion is for another time .
HOME FORECLOSURE PROCESS LEGAL ADVICE | QUEENS
First , you should be farsighted , and apply even when applying for a mortgage , insurance for a mortgage loan , in case of unemployment or disability .
But suppose you did not do this , do not despair , there is always a way out .
You ca n’t hide your plight from the bank and as soon as any problems appear , notify the bank , maybe you will meet and delay the next payment , and during this time you will be able to solve your problems .
It is also possible for some time to allow you to pay not the entire fee , but , for example , only interest .
In general , it is better to contact the bank and discuss all the ways to solve the problem .
If things are really bad , then you can always sell an apartment and buy an apartment with a lower cost again in a mortgage .
You can also give a part of the apartment or the entire apartment for rent , and put the proceeds to pay off the debt .
You can always figure out the problem and find a way out because banks take apartments only after six months of late payment , and if you do n’t hide your financial position from a bank , then this problem may not be the main thing , time works for you .
It would be good to consult with a lawyer so as not to miss anything and arrange all the accompanying documents correctly , here our specialists will help you .
“ Brett ” the goat apparently avoided being butchered by a group of carnivorous football fans Friday after he was found painted , partially shaved and tied up in a car trunk at the Minnesota - Wisconsin border .
It started when a 20 - something woman came in to Tires Plus in Winona , Minn. , across the Mississippi River from Wisconsin , where James Prusi was working Friday morning .
One of the engine belts of the woman ’s Chevy Malibu was busted .
Prusi said he would call when it was ready .
“ Oh , by the way , there ’s a goat in my trunk , ” the woman added as she was getting ready to leave .
“ There ’s a what ? ”
“ A goat . …
It ’s alive , but we ’re going to butcher it , ” the woman said , flashing a “ kind of nervous smile , ” according to Prusi .
“ She was probably anticipating how I was going to take it , ” Prusi said in an interview Monday .
Prusi really did n’t know how to take it .
He glanced at a co-worker , and the two exchanged bewildered looks .
“ We specialize in brakes , alignment and tires .
Do n’t really know how to fix goats , ” Prusi said in the interview .
“ I did n’t take it any further .
I did n’t ask her why . ”
The woman left , and soon afterward , the goat started bleating .
“ It was crying loud , almost sounded like it was a kid , ” Prusi said .
The Tires Plus crew opened the trunk , and the goat stuck out its head .
Prusi said the side he could see was painted purple , and there were paint smears from the other side that looked like they might have been green or gold .
The numeral 4 — a number that earned new fans and alienated old ones when former Green Bay Packers quarterback Brett Favre signed with the Minnesota Vikings last week — was shaved into the goat ’s side .
Its legs were tied .
“ We could n’t goat - sit all night , ” Prusi said , so the crew shut the trunk , but the goat started making noise after another 10 minutes .
Prusi called animal control , who told them they ’d be right out .
When the woman came back about 90 minutes after dropping off the car , she was accompanied by a man her age carrying a child about 3 years old .
Prusi tried not to ask any questions .
“ I wanted to keep my conversation with them to a minimum .
I felt guilty turning them in , ” Prusi said .
“ But they were torturing this poor goat . ”
Within a few minutes , an animal - control officer showed up , accompanied by two Winona police cars .
The animal - control officer took the goat and the couple left in the woman ’s car .
Prusi said he did n’t hear what authorities said to her .
Prusi said that the woman ’s car had Minnesota plates and that she had a St. Paul address .
He said neither she nor the man or child had any football team paraphernalia to identify their loyalties .
“ There ’s Vikings and Packers fans mixed ” in Winona , Prusi said .
“ It ’s about 50 - 50 here . ”
Favre ’s debut with the Vikings was Friday night in a 17 - 13 preseason victory over the Kansas City Chiefs at the Metrodome .
Animal control took the goat to a local veterinarian , according to the Associated Press .
It was renamed Brett and placed in foster care .
An animal - control officer informed Prusi that the goat , about a year old , was “ malnourished and skinny . ”
Animal - control officer Wendy Peterson said Monday that the Winona city attorney is reviewing the case for possible citations , according to the Associated Press .

Travel with me back to yesterday , the early days of the Reagan administration , when taxes were being cut and spending increases were being curbed ( the actual cuts were few ) , and when journalists were losing their heads about the supposedly catastrophic state of the economy .
The prevailing ethos in those days in the White House was somewhat sensible .
The idea was that the recession had to be permitted to run its course .
The late 1970s inflation coupled with recession had wrought dollar depreciation plus high unemployment and high interest rates .
These were part of the adjustment process .
No one doubted it .
Now , there was a time , only a few years earlier , when the Keynesian orthodoxy claimed the power to control the economy the way we control our cars .
One could adjust the inflation up to drive unemployment down , and adjust the inflation down and pay the price in higher unemployment .
It was a trade off , and the wise economists would decide what was socially optimal .
One can only marvel at the navet , but it all came crashing down with the advent of the simultaneous appearance of both inflation and unemployment , and Keynesian confidence was shaken to its core .
The better members of the Reagan team were more realistic .
They believed that the goal of government policy was to create the conditions for economic growth , and if that meant letting bad policies wash themselves away during the transition , so be it .
The journalistic establishment at the time hated them and their free - enterprise ideas .
So , of course , all bad news was treated as not only worse than it really was , it was also blamed on the Reagan administration , as if it had the control over events that Keynesians imputed to government .
So , if times were bad , who were to blame but the people in control ?

Every day the headlines blasted away , as if the media establishment were trying to whip the public up into a hysterical frenzy against tax cuts .
People were encouraged to blame That Man in the White House for all existing evil , and the nightly newscasts were filled with furrow - browed anchors doing stories on the poor suffering masses and their desperate plight .
Their political agenda was aggressively on display , brazen beyond belief .
And then something amazing happened .
The economy began to recover .
Unemployment fell , inflation crashed , interest rates came down , and growth returned .
The criticism later changed : the Reagan administration was accused of being too pro-growth and unleashing greed and “ cowboy capitalism . ”
But it fell on deaf ears , and Reagan won a landslide reelection in 1984 .
Now , I ’m not saying that Reagan was laissez - faire or that the economic recovery did n’t owe something to a newly fashioned form of military Keynesianism .
Rather , my focus here is on the spin : the press hated him , and exaggerated the failings of the economic structure in order to destroy policies it hated .
The contrast with the Obama administration ca n’t be more stark .
No one in these ranks said that malinvestments have to be washed out of the system and bankruptcies and unemployment must be tolerated for a time in order to get back on a growth .
Nay , nay , they pulled out the old bag of tricks and claim that they only needed to loot the public of hundreds of billions and spend it on building up government , and then , wow , like magic , the entire economy would come back to life .
But it has n’t .
The stock markets survive , but that ’s no indication .
Stock markets are never better performing than during a hyperinflation .
Interest rates are rock bottom , but only through artificial means .

Investment is still falling off a cliff , having already completely erased ten years of investment from the record of history .
Here is a fundamental factor that suggests that terrible things are still to come our way .
And I guess I ’ll have to put this in italics because the point seems to be lost in the shuffle : unemployment is still rising , even soaring straight to double digits !

The sociology of this intrigues me to no end .
Unemployment is one of the human elements that journalists are supposed to glom onto .
Oh , look at poor Bob and Jane and how they lost their jobs and have nowhere to go , etc. , etc .
Talk about human interest !
Where are the weepy stories about the plight of people wandering around with no work ?
Instead , we get happy clappy stories about how things are not nearly as bad as they might be had the great and powerful Obama of Oz not appeared to save the day .
There is also the remarkable spin that things are getting worse , yes , but at a slower pace than before — an observation that might be most commonly heard in Hell .
Obama himself has other lines .
“ In the last few months , the economy has done measurably better than expected . ”
Well , that depends on your expectations , does n’t it ?
It is irrefutable .
But the press is glad to be the echo chamber .
“ Figures released last week showed that the economy contracted more slowly in the second quarter than many economists had expected . ”
And then there are the benchmarks , and that might be the scariest part of all .
The Obama administration is convinced that we can have no real and lasting recovery until homes go up in price .
A top adviser said : “ until we see a robust recovery in housing markets , housing prices , in jobs and family income , we ’re not anywhere near out of the woods . ”
This is precisely the same inanity that afflicted the Hoover and Roosevelt administrations .
They saw falling prices as the problem to be remedied rather than the saving grace of an otherwise abysmal economic environment .
So they kept trying to stamp out good things thinking that they were bad things , effectively burning the crops instead of killing the rats that were poisoning the wheat following harvest .
We can fully expect the mainline press not to understand economics .
I can deal with that .
But not even to draw attention to the awful reality of the current economic situation , simply because many members of the mainstream press are sympathetic to the idea that the government should be stealing ever more money from us for the state ?
Here is where ideology leads to blindness , which leads to the worst form of propaganda .
I suspect that they will no more get away with this now than they did in the 1980s .

I wrote this hopefully persuasive essay for the printed newsletter published by FIJA .
I ’ve missed the deadline for the Summer issue , but it should appear later this year .
I had been reading their letters to the editor and been amazed that no one was writing about much else besides just giving Fully Informed Jury Association information to their friends , family , and co-workers .
This is good , but not particularly effective .
I hope that explaining what we do here in Keene will encourage others around the country to duplicate our efforts , or better yet come to NH and get active here .
I ’m publishing this article here on the blog in the hopes that it will encourage similar activism other parts of New Hampshire , where honestly , there is no excuse for activists to not be doing this incredibly simple and effective activism .
We ’ve been challenging the activists in other areas to take this up for months now , and they have n’t .
Which of course just makes Keene a more attractive destination in comparison .
Thanks to Chris Muskus for being the driving force behind this amazingly successful FIJA outreach , as it enters it ’s second year this August .
In the last year , my fellow activists and I have distributed hundreds of Fully Informed Jury Association pamphlets into the hands of potential jurors as they arrive at the courthouse for jury selection .
Month after month , we gather on the first Monday in front of the Cheshire superior court in Keene , New Hampshire and offer FIJA information to every single person walking into the courthouse .
We arrive at 8 am when the doors open and stay until about 8:45 am , fifteen minutes after the potential jurors are supposed to be there , just to make sure we reach all the late arrivals .
About 80 - 90 % of the people we approach will take the flier .
Usually I ’ll smile and say something like , “ Good morning , would you like some free information on your rights as a juror ? ” , and hold out a trifold .
That ’s all it takes !
I think it ’s great that people are giving FIJA info to their friends , family , and co-workers .
Reading the letters to the editor of this newsletter reveals to me that is happening a lot .
I find myself wondering however , is Keene , NH the only place in the country where FIJA outreach is targeting potential jurors as they walk in the court for jury selection ?
I certainly hope we are n’t the first doing this form of FIJA outreach consistently , but in case we are , I wanted to share it with you as something you may want to consider duplicating in your area .
Approaching potential jurors outside the courthouse is the most effective form of FIJA outreach , in my opinion .
Here ’s why :
1. Potential jurors are the best prospects for this message .
They are about to go into the selection process and are more likely to be interested in matters regarding their rights as a juror at this time moreso than any other point in their life .
2. Jury selection usually involves a whole lot of waiting .
People who have been before know this , but first - timers may not .
They will really appreciate having something to read ( the FIJA pamphlet ) when they sit down in the waiting area .
3 . Done consistently , you can reach every potential juror with FIJA information .
That ’s effective !
Yes , this does take a little time and preparation , but not much .
The only costs are what you ’ll spend either printing the fliers yourself using the .
PDF files on FIJA.org , or ordering them from FIJA .
( We print our own with our FreeKeene.com blog url printed in the area on the back . )
Otherwise , you ’re just spending a little bit of time .
More populated areas probably choose juries more often than once a month , so go as often as you can .
I also recommend you go with other activists .
Do n’t do this alone , or you risk police harassment .
The more of you there are , the more likely you ’ll be left alone .
We find that four is the ideal number , with two being the bare minimum .
We position two activists on each direction people can approach from , so we do n’t miss anybody .
If your courthouse has more than one entrance , you may need more people .
In case the police or court bailiffs decide to harass you , make sure to have recording devices handy .
Let them know they are being recorded as soon as they approach .
Do not heed their demands to stop .
If they are on the job and in public , they should be on the record .
Assure them you are engaging in free speech and that you will not block entrances .
Do n’t be rude , but also do n’t be meek and obedient .
Practice asking questions of the officers rather than answering theirs .
He who asks the questions controls the conversation .
In our case , the first month we did this , two sheriffs came up and asked what we were doing , then went away and we never saw them again , but we had more than four volunteers right from day one .
It helps if you outnumber them .
In most places in the country , it ’s finding someone to help you that will be the biggest difficulty .
When I used to do liberty activism down in Sarasota , FL , it was like pulling teeth getting people to volunteer to do things like this FIJA outreach .
Up here in New Hampshire , we have more than enough volunteers show up every single month .
Why ?
The Free State Project is the difference .
In case you were n’t aware , thousands of people have pledged to move to NH and get active for liberty .
That means everything from doing FIJA , to politics , civil disobedience , and creating our own media .
It ’s all happening and it ’s happening now , since hundreds of people have already made the move and more are coming every week !
So , if you ’re frustrated by the lack of liberty activism in your area and really want a chance at liberty in your lifetime , you owe it to yourself to look into the Free State Project at FreeStateProject.org
I ’m having the time of my life !
The liberty activists moving here as part of the Free State Project are the nicest people and the best activists I ’ve ever seen .
To get a look at some of the other things happening our little corner of NH , visit our blog at FreeKeene.com and to get a wider perspective , the FSP features blogs from around the state on the front page of FreeStateProject.org
With that , I encourage you to get out in front of the courthouse while potential jurors are arriving for selection and get them much - needed FIJA info !
An overdraft ?
That 'll be £ 200 at Lloyds TSB ( but only £ 15 if you 're a Muslim )
Many Lloyds TSB customers are being hit with charges of up to £ 200 a month if they go into the red - while Muslims who use the bank are only being charged £ 15 .
The part - nationalised bank has been accused of religious discrimination over the disparity between overdraft charges on its standard current account and its Islamic account .
The Islamic account was set up by the high street bank to attract Muslim customers by allowing them to keep faithful to their religion .
Sharia law does not permit the payment of interest so the ' typical ' Islamic account at Lloyds TSB has been set up without an overdraft facility .
Other rules :
No interest is charged on Islamic accounts , while customers with a normal account are hit with charges of up to £ 200
If a Muslim customer who has insufficient funds in the account tries to make a payment , it is blocked and a ' return item fee ' is charged .
However , on some Islamic accounts such a payment is authorised and an ' unplanned overdraft fee ' of £ 15 is then levied .
The bank says this is a management fee , not a payment of interest , so does not contradict Sharia law .
Meanwhile , customers with standard current accounts who go into the red by at least £ 100 without authorisation are hit with an ' unplanned overdraft fee ' of £ 20 a day for a maximum of ten days .
This could mean a customer has to pay £ 200 in one month .
The Islamic account is available to all customers at Lloyds TSB .
In theory , anyone who does not need a permanent overdraft facility could switch to this account to avoid being hit by interest charges for going into the red .
The disparity between the two accounts emerged after the bank sent its customers a booklet this month explaining its charges .
Graham Milne , a customer and chartered accountant from Norham , Northumberland , said difference in fees was tantamount to ' religious discrimination ' .
He added : ' This means that all the non-Islamic account holders are subsidising those with such an account .
It strikes me as something which is bordering on illegal .
' One cannot help feeling the organisation is bending over backwards to help Muslims to the detriment of everybody else .
' The man in the street would say this is a form of theft .
Whether you call it a management fee or an interest fee , it makes no odds because they mean the same thing . '
In the past few years , millions of customers at all the major high street banks have demanded the return of money which has been taken from their account in various forms of bank charges .
Many got their money , or the majority of it , back .
A test case - designed to rule if such charges are illegal - is going through the House of Lords .
Until it is resolved , the subject continues to remain hotly contested .
A Lloyds TSB spokesman said : ' The Islamic current account is for customers who cannot receive credit or debit interest due to their religious beliefs .
' All of our Islamic accounts comply with Islamic law and are available to anyone regardless of background or faith .
' These accounts are structured differently to our traditional accounts and are designed to help prevent a customer slipping into the red .
A comparison with the overdraft charging structure on other accounts is meaningless . '
Earlier this month , it emerged that losses at Lloyds had escalated to £ 13.4 billion - largely due to the reckless lending of Halifax Bank of Scotland , which it bought for £ 9.6 billion in January .
The disastrous merger led to a £ 17 billion taxpayer bail - out .
The newly - formed Lloyds Banking Group is 43 per cent owned by the taxpayer .

* Spread out in the hall and try to be in the front half .
The objective is to put the Rep on the defensive with your questions and follow - up .
The Rep should be made to feel that a majority , and if not , a significant portion of at least the audience , opposes the socialist agenda of Washington .
They need to leave the hall with so me doubts about their agenda .
The other objective is to illustrate for the balance of the audience that the national leadership is acting against our founders ' principles which are on the other side of the debate -- and show them that there are a lot of solid citizens in the district who oppose the socialist approach to the nation 's challenges .
We want the independent thinkers to leave the hall with doubts about the Democrat solutions continually proposed by the national leadership .
* You need to rock - the - boat early in the Rep 's presentation , Watch for an opportunity to yell out and challenge the Rep 's statements early .
If he blames Bush for something or offers other excuses -- call him on it , yell back and have someone else follow - up with a shout - out .
Do n't carry on and make a scene -- just short intermittent shout outs .
The purpose is to make him uneasy early on and set the tone for the hall as clearly informal , and free - wheeling .
It will also embolden others who agree with us to call out and challenge with tough questions .
The goal is to rattle him , get him off his prepared script and agenda .
If he says something outrageous , stand up and shout out and sit right down .
Look for these opportunities before he even takes questions .
* When the formal Q&A session begins get all your hands up and keep up -- be persistent throughout the entire session .
Keep body language neutral and look positive to improve chances of being selected .
When called on , a specific prepared question that puts the onus on to answer .
It can be a question including lots of statistics / facts .
You will not be interrupted from reading a solid question .
If you ramble on too long without a focus , you wiII be stopped .
After the Rep answers , or more likely diverts or dodges , be prepared with a follow - up take the initiative and you will be able to follow - up .
The balance of the group should applaud when the question is asked , further putting the Rep on the defensive .
If the Rep tries a particularly odious diversion , someone from the group should yell out to answer the question .
These tactics will clearly rattle the Rep and illustrate some degree of his ineptness to the balance of the audience .
I 've been writing about my fabulous adventure with the teabaggers in Alhambra all week and I 've been posting pictures that I took and that my old pal , filmmaker Nancy Stein , took .
I arrived at the Adam Schiff town hall thing at 4 pm , three hours before it started , at a time when most of the people milling around ( or sitting in lawn chairs ) were from the far right local fringe group , Pasadena Patriots and other assorted nuts teabaggers , and , as Larry Schorr dubbed them , " townshirts .
" I spent the three hours talking with them -- not arguing for the most part , just trying to understand where they 're coming from .
Some were just confused people with a lot of time on their hands and too many hours listening to the self - serving sociopathic hate rants by Limbaugh , Coulter , Beck and Dobbs ... but some were dedicated movement conservatives following the agenda laid out in Dick Armey 's Freedomworks playbook for systematically disrupting Democratic town halls and intimidating congressmen and normal constituents .
Read a few lines from it -- this leaked plan for intimidating easily - intimidated , congenitally cowardly members of Congress :
At the bottom of this post is a YouTube posted by a right - wing propagandist .
It 's of a team I met in Alhambra , a man and a woman with posters even more aggressively bizarre than other 's , filled with self - righteous anger and bile .
This is another teabagger even though -- one in front of Dianne Feinstein 's office a few days later .
I had listened to the woman 's sob story about how she 's been screwed over by the insurance companies -- one of which she is suing .
I was curious why she was so opposed to health care reform that would address the exact problems she was talking about .
My question got her angrier and she accused me of trying to confuse her .
She went from looking slightly deranged to looking menacing and dangerous .
She was obviously hopped up on drugs .
She talked to me for 20 - 30 minutes , mostly complaining about everything that popped into her mind .
I started wondering if her neckbrace and walker were real .
Many people were there with fake medical equipment -- and I blogged about one friendly right - wing lady who got out of her scooter and asked me to sit in it for her while she ran off to wave her sign , scream and demonstrate for a while .
I do n't know if the woman with the neck brace was a faker or not , but when I saw the YouTube yesterday I realized she and her partner were weaving quite a tale for the media .
The claim that her injuries were caused by a liberal assaulting her on Tuesday were patently false -- a clear distortion to put the onus for violence of pro-health care supporters and remove it from the violent rightists who have been instructed about how to disrupt events .
Her husband ( or " husband " ) -- the one with the Nancy Pelosi cryptkeeper sign who was denying being " astroturf " or right - wing had his lines well memorized .
They were exactly -- word for word -- what he had spouted off to me earlier in the week .
In fact almost every single person speaking was speaking directly from prepared texts ... word for word .
The woman started quoting Saul Alinsky .
Their goal : project their own failings onto SEIU , Acorn and liberals .
Before you watch them spin , I see a post she did with her version of the " assault " ( which is now being blown up into a story by far right blogs

Do you know who pays for the racist campaign against Obama ?
GEICO , NutriSystems , Proctor & Gamble , and ... United Postal Service .
Yep , those are the advertisers who pay for the TV time so that deranged sociopath Glenn Beck can get up and spout his divisive hatred and racism .
And today the top online civil rights group Color of Change urged its 600,000 - plus members to petition companies who advertise on Glenn Beck ’s radio and television shows to urge them to cut off their advertising on Beck ’s programs .
The mobilization comes after Beck called President Obama a “ racist ” who “ has a deep - seated hatred for white people ” during an appearance Tuesday on .
[ Video below ]
Color of Change has also been urging CNN to fire their own racist shill , Lou Dobbs for his gratuitous birther campaign , which CNN irresponsibly uses to pump up lagging viewership .
“ What Beck is doing is race - baiting at its worst , it 's dangerous and it's hard to imagine any company wanting their brand associated with it , ” said James Rucker of ColorOfChange.org .
“ Beck has now shown that his extreme views are more appropriate for a street corner than a major media program .
He no longer deserves the backing of mainstream advertisers .
” Please sign their petition
If CNN is trying to get ratings with Lou Dobb 's hate show -- which is what Bill O'Reilly claims ( and who would know better ? ) -- the tactic is failing .
His ratings have taken a serious hit since he started his psychotic birther campaign according to today's

Angelus Novus
One of the odd and not - very - well - known - by - non - Irish - people things about Ireland is that every day , at 6 pm , the main television station broadcasts the Angelus – one minute precisely of church bells ringing – for people to pause , reflect ( and at least according to the original intentions of those who instituted it ) , pray .
1
Back when I was growing up in Ireland , and the vast majority of my compatriots claimed that they went to Mass every week , the Angelus bells were accompanied by still shots of paintings of the Holy Family .
As the country began to modernize a bit in the 1980s and 1990s , the Angelus gradually became more pluralistic , titillating religiously adventurous viewers with the occasional picture of a Russian Orthodox icon or whatever .
But what to do after the supplanting of Roman Catholic hegemony by a bog- standard West European post - religious society ?
The “ Irish Times ” : http://www.irishtimes.com/newspaper/frontpage/2009/0919/1224254866639.html has an interesting short article on the politics of the Angelus in the modern era .
bq. THE ANGELUS will from next Monday be changed – though not utterly .
Under a revamping of the evening pause for prayer on RTÉ
One television , the gongs will remain the same .
… the same ones as have been heard since the Angelus was first broadcast on RTÉ radio in 1950 , and which originated with the bells at Dublin ’s Pro-Cathedral … seven “ episodes ” in a new Angelus mini-series of visual reflections … oblivious calm amid the hue and cry … while he sketches an image of a pair of praying hands .
… mother in Sixmilebridge , Co Clare , as she polishes a memorial stone to her drowned son … grandparents Tess and Pascal Finn feeding fussy swans on the Shannon at Limerick and Enniscorthy fisherman John Keating , who is shown out at sea in his trawler … Namucana Nyambe from Zambia as she gazes contemplatively towards the Phoenix Park … grist to the mill for those avid letter writers who have been campaigning for years to get the Angelus taken off the schedule of the State broadcaster .
It ’s interesting how little bits of the previously dominant religious culture can weather the storm of progress – but only through the transfiguration of their content .
If the Angelus did n’t already exist it would never be instituted in a society like contemporary Ireland – but since it does exist and would be difficult to get rid of without upsetting people ( still - believing Catholics ; once - were - Catholics who fancy they would miss it if it were gone ) it has been gradually transformed instead into something that maintains the form of the original ( still the old church bells ) , but few of the original religious valences .
1 Italy ’s _ Rai Uno_ has something similar as I recall ( although timed not to interfere with the celebration of the true national religion , soccer ) .
Another major US bank collapses
By Patrick O'Connor
17 August 2009
Alabama - based Colonial Bank collapsed Friday , bringing the total number of US bank failures so far this year to 77 .
With assets of $ 25 billion , Colonial is the sixth - biggest bank failure in American history , and the biggest since Washington Mutual ’s banking operation was shut down by federal regulators and sold to JPMorgan Chase in September 2008 .
Colonial ’s collapse “ signals an ominous phase in the nation ’s banking crisis , ” the Wall Street Journal commented .
“ Even as some large institutions show signs of stabilizing , a slew of regional lenders remain on the ropes .
And regulators appear to be giving up hope that some of them can be saved . ”
The demise of Colonial Bank appears to be another instance of reckless speculation combined with outright criminality .
The institution had engaged in aggressive lending focused on the real estate market in Florida .
The sub - prime mortgage collapse , which has especially affected Florida , led to Colonial registering unsustainable losses and write - downs .
The bank lost more than $ 600 million in the last quarter , and by last month had $ 1 billion in “ non-performing assets ” out of total assets of $ 26 billion .
The bank had sought more than $ 500 million in bailout money from the Troubled Asset Relief Program ( TARP ) , but this was made conditional on it raising an additional $ 300 million from private investors or other banks .
Efforts to secure this money failed after a federal criminal investigation was launched into a proposed deal with Florida - based mortgage company Taylor , Bean & Whitaker .
Agents with the FBI and Treasury Department raided Colonial ’s offices earlier this month .
The Wall Street Journal reported on August 8 : “ The bank said the Justice Department is investigating its lending division that originates mortgages the bank does n’t intend to keep , as well as related accounting irregularities over several years . ”
In an earlier incident which highlighted the impunity with which the banks have been able to operate , Colonial changed regulators when questions were first raised about its finances .
In 2008 , the bank abandoned its charter with its primary regulator , the Office of the Comptroller of the Currency ( OCC ) , and opted for Alabama state regulations after the OCC highlighted its exposure to Florida ’s commercial real estate market .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corp ( FDIC ) oversaw the fire - sale of Colonial to the North Carolina - based regional bank BB&T , now to become the eighth largest US bank measured by deposits .
The transaction involved the now standard “ no - loss ” guarantee , with the FDIC agreeing to share losses with BB&T on $ 15 billion of Colonial ’s assets .
The bank collapse is expected to cost the FDIC about $ 2.8 billion , further depleting its deposit insurance fund , which last March was just $ 13 billion .
In addition to Colonial , four smaller banks collapsed last week — Community Bank of Nevada , Dwelling House , Union Bank , and Community Bank of Arizona — costing the FDIC another $ 875 million .
More institutions have already collapsed in 2009 than in any year since 1992 .
The failure rate is accelerating — of the 77 bank failures thus far this year , 32 have occurred in the last seven weeks alone .
The Wall Street Journal noted Saturday that the banks now failing are in far worse shape than those which collapsed during the industry ’s last crisis from 1989 - 1995 , costing the FDIC substantially more .
The federal agency has listed 305 unidentified institutions as “ problem banks . ”
A Bloomberg analysis published last Friday found that more than 150 publicly traded US lenders have “ nonperforming loans ” on their books equal to five percent or more of their holdings — a level which threatens banks ’ entire equity .
These institutions , which do not include the 19 largest banks regarded by Treasury as “ too big to fail , ” have combined deposits of $ 193 billion — “ almost 15 times the size of the FDIC ’s deposit insurance fund at the end of the first quarter . ”
President Barack Obama ’s administration has averted a full - scale collapse of the financial markets by placing trillions of dollars in public funds at the disposal of the banks — but none of the underlying problems have been addressed .
Up to $ 2 trillion in bad debts and worthless securities ( known as “ toxic ” or “ troubled ” assets ) remain on the banks ’ books .
The Congressional Oversight Panel , the body which reports to Congress on TARP ’s progress , last week issued its monthly report for August .
The report emphasized : “ It would be foolish to think that the risk of troubled assets has been mitigated or that it does not remain the most serious risk to the American financial system . ”
The report also noted that “ it is likely that an overwhelming portion of the troubled assets from last October remain on the bank balance sheets today . ”
These assets are largely comprised of defaulted mortgages and the edifice of securities and other speculative mechanisms built upon the mortgage market .
The Congressional Oversight Panel warned : “ If the economy worsens , especially if unemployment remains elevated or if the commercial real estate market collapses , then defaults will rise and the troubled assets will continue to deteriorate in value .
Banks will incur further losses on their troubled assets . ”
No one is yet aware of the true extent of the crisis .
In an extraordinary admission , the Congressional Oversight Panel report stated : “ It is impossible to resolve the argument about whether banks are or are not solvent because of the uncertain value of their loans . ”
In other words , policy makers in the world ’s leading capitalist economy are proceeding without even knowing whether the national banking system is solvent .
This ignorance is partly due to changes in accounting regulations enacted in April this year by the Financial Accounting Standards Board .
Under the old guidelines , banks were required to maintain up - to - date market value reports of its asset holdings , but now banks can suspend this reporting principle if market prices for securities and other toxic assets are deemed to be based on a “ distressed market , ” or in cases where assets are not intended for immediate sale .
In these instances , assets can be listed at their initial purchase price , concealing the true value .
The Congressional Oversight Panel explained : “ Once a bank sells a legacy security or legacy loan , it must book the sale value , but if the bank holds the asset , it may continue to mark the asset at the higher value permitted by the new rule .
Thus any sale at less than amortized cost value would forgo the benefit of being able to avoid distress pricing and force perhaps substantial write - downs ...
To the extent banks have not written down troubled assets , they are in effect continuing to invest in those assets by holding them for a future return ... postponing the day of reckoning if it turns out that , rather than appreciating , the assets depreciate . ”
The banks ’ estimate that their troubled assets will prove more valuable in the future is based on political rather than market calculations .
The toxic assets relating to the sub - prime mortgage industry are effectively worthless and would never regain their former value in normal market conditions .
Mortgage defaults have spread far beyond the sub - prime category and are continuing as the unemployment crisis worsens and as property prices continue to fall .
The TARP report cited a Deutsche Bank estimate that by 2011 , 48 percent of US homeowners will owe more than their house is worth .
In addition , the commercial real estate market may be set to crash , also bringing down commercial real estate securities .
The Congressional Oversight Panel explained that this would create a new class of troubled assets , and place “ more general renewed pressure on bank balance sheets that would again call into question the true value of residential mortgage loans . ”
The banks are nevertheless holding onto their toxic assets in the expectation that the Obama administration will eventually intervene and use additional public funds to buy the worthless securities at prices equivalent to their listed value before the financial crisis .
Alternatively , if direct government purchase proves unviable , the banks expect the government to provide additional no-loss guarantees and public subsidies to allow toxic assets to be sold at a profit to other private buyers .
In the meantime , the toxic assets provide the banks with a convenient pretext for maintaining restrictive lending practices which are badly affecting consumers and small businesses .
The TARP fund was supposed to provide billions in public funds to make credit more accessible and less costly — but this was not made mandatory and the banks have simply used the money to shore up their bottom line , and , in many cases , continue to pay out exorbitant bonuses to the very executives responsible for creating the crisis in the first place .
The latest Congressional Oversight Panel TARP report emphasized that mid-sized banks , those with assets between $ 600 million and $ 100 billion , are at most risk of going under and may need additional public capital of up to $ 21 billion .
The report included a series of recommendations to shore up these strata of the banking sector , including expanded modeling to test the longer - term security of their asset and capital holdings and greater disclosure regulations to force banks to reveal the toxic assets on their books .
Neither the Treasury Department nor the Federal Reserve is inclined to enact these recommended measures .
The Obama administration has proven itself as a ruthless defender of the financial elite ’s interests .
Acting as the instrument of the major banks , it is using the accelerating rate of bank collapses to restructure the industry .
Smaller and less competitive institutions are being deliberately purged , with federal regulators taking on their bad debts and handing over remaining assets and infrastructure to larger financial institutions .
The result will be a further consolidation of the economic and social power of a small network of mega - banks .
Three types of chemical highs which are currently legal are due to be banned by the end of the year :
GBL ( Gamma - Butyrolactone ) is a chemical solvent which is converted in the stomach into the Class C drug GHB ( gamma - hydroxybutyrate ) which is nicknamed " liquid ecstasy " .
GHB emerged on the party scene in the 1990s and was banned in 2003 .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
GBL has already been banned for personal use in several countries including the United States , Canada and Sweden but its industrial use as a paint stripper means it is widely available on the internet and even in some health food shops for reportedly as little as 50 p per dose .
The UK's Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs highlighted last August that the " harms and misuse " of GBL were commensurate with a Class C drug .
The dangers were also highlighted in a report by the European Monitoring Centre for Drugs and Drug Addiction earlier this year .
It said GBL was becoming more popular as a recreational drug and , despite security measures to limit its use in clubs and pubs , it was regularly being smuggled into London nightspots mixed with water in plastic bottles , condoms and balloons .
It is virtually tasteless when diluted .
The report said : " The ease with which GBL and thus GHB can be acquired allows potentially much easier and cheaper access than that usually found in illicit drug markets in the EU . "
It said people who bought the drug ranged from clubbers seeking euphoria to people interested in purported anti-ageing remedies or seeking increased sexual function .
The death of student Hester Stewart , 21 , in April this year prompted calls for GBL to be outlawed which were led by her family .
Miss Stewart , a cheerleader with the Brighton and Sussex Waves , died after she consumed GBL with her on - off boyfriend Anthony Morrison after returning to his shared house in Brighton following an American football awards ceremony .
Mr Morrison said it was the first time that Ms Stewart , a University of Sussex student studying molecular medicine , had taken the drug , which had been bought online from a site which warned it was not for human consumption .
She was dead when he woke up at 9 am on April 6 , he told an inquest into her death .
The inquest was told although the level of GBL consumed by Ms Stewart was low and would have led to full recovery in some people , its combination with alcohol proved fatal .
Brighton and Hove coroner Veronica Hamilton - Deeley , who recorded a verdict of misadventure , said people using drugs like GBL recreationally needed to understand they were playing " Russian Roulette " .
The Home Office plans to classify GBL as a Class C drug and ban it when intended for human consumption .
Synthetic cannabinoids , like the brand Spice , will become a Class B drug , the same as cannabis .
The Government 's drug adviser called for Spice to be banned earlier this month , saying it was created using dangerous chemicals although sold as a " natural " high .
Professor David Nutt , chairman of the Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs ( ACMD ) , said : " Spice and other synthetic cannabinoid products are being sold legally as harmless ' herbal legal highs ' .
" However , the herbal content is coated in one or more dangerous chemical compounds that mimic the effects of cannabis .
" These are not harmless herbal alternatives and have been found to cause paranoia and panic attacks . "
Pouches of the drug are currently widely available on the internet and in so - called " head shops " for around £ 20 for three grams .
It is sold under brands such as Spice Silver , Spice Gold , Spice Diamond and Spice Yucatan Fire .
The drug was banned in Germany , Austria and France , earlier this year .
Reports from Germany suggested some users suffered heart problems after smoking the drug .
Spice and other so - called synthetic cannabinoids escape existing UK drugs laws because they do not contain marijuana and are not chemically related to it .
But by spraying synthetic additives on to herbs , dealers can create similar intoxication in users to that caused by THC , the active ingredient in cannabis .
Analysis of samples of Spice showed it had a " higher potency " than THC , the ACMD warned .
Its report said herbs listed on the packets of the drug were often not found inside and large amounts of Vitamin E were used to hide other chemicals .
It said users could not " assume the same effects from the same product the next time they use it " .
BZP ( Benzylpiperazine ) is used to worm animals and as a fertiliser but has become popular for recreational use as it can have a similar effect to amphetamine .
The drug is said to create euphoria and enhance a user 's sense of taste , sound and colour .
Some websites have marketed it as legal ecstasy and sell it for as little as £ 1 a tablet but it has already been banned in countries including America , Australia and Japan .
Assistant deputy Sheffield coroner David Urpeth described BZP as a " huge concern for society " when he recorded a verdict of misadventure into the death of Daniel Backhouse , 22 , from Sheffield , who suffered heart failure after mixing BZP with MDMA , the powdered form of Ecstasy .
Mr Urpeth , speaking in May , said there was a " significant chance " of more deaths where BZP was mixed with ecstasy .
The Government plans to control BZP , and related piperazines , as Class C drugs .
A pretty ultramarine blue flower which changes colour in response to temperature , a flying frog and the world 's oldest mushroom preserved in amber are among the 350 new species discovered in the Eastern Himalayas over the past 10 years .
But experts warn the new discoveries are under pressure from demand for land and climate change .
A report published today by the WWF , The Eastern Himalayas – Where Worlds Collide , lists 242 new types of plants , 16 amphibians , 16 reptiles , 14 fish , two birds and two mammals and 61 new invertebrates .
The cache , quality and diversity of species newly discovered between 1998 and 2008 make the mountainous region one of the world 's most important biological hotspots .
The WWF is asking the governments of Bhutan , India and Nepal to commit to cooperate on conservation efforts in the geographic region that transcends the borders of the three countries to protect the landscape and the livelihoods of people living in the Eastern Himalayas .
Population growth , deforestation , overgrazing , poaching , the wildlife trade , mining , pollution , and hydropower development have all contributed to the pressures on the fragile ecosystems in the region , the report says .
Only 25 % of the original habitats in the region remain intact and 163 species that live in the Eastern Himalayas are considered globally threatened .
Because the region sits at the biogeographical crossroads of two continental plates , it contains a wide range of biodiversity and landscapes from both worlds .
The Indo - Malayan lowlands are home to Asian elephants , clouded leopards , wild water buffalo , gaur , hornbills , cobras and geckos .
The elevated Palearctic to the north is home to snow leopards , red pandas , black bears , and wolves .
The world 's highest mountains sit in close proximity to some of the world 's deepest gorges in a region that also contains the world 's most northerly tropical jungles , temperate forests , tall grasslands , savannas and rich alpine meadows .
A great deal of the rugged region , which also includes small areas of China and Burma , is difficult to access and has made biological surveys extremely difficult and left large areas biologically unexplored .
But the intrepid are richly rewarded with new discoveries .
Impatiens namchabarwensis , or the blue diamond impatiens , is one of the 242 new plant species to have been discovered in the past 10 years .
The highly endemic ultramarine blue flower was discovered during an epic expedition undertaken by Chinese botanists who trekked 60 miles from the nearest road and descended into the Namcha Barwa canyon , a gorge measuring almost 402 miles long and , in places , twice as deep as the Grand Canyon , which can reach depths of up to 6,000 feet .
The rare plant can grow as tall as 60 cm and flowers all year round .
The flower is perhaps the best symbol of the effects of climate change in the region as its colour changes according to temperature and exposure .
In a cool climate , its appears pure blue , but darkens to a purple when the temperature rises .
A bright green , red - footed tree frog was described in 2007 , and called a " flying frog " because its long , webbed feet allow it to glide when falling .
An amber mine in far north Burma has also thrown up some important new discoveries : a 100 m - year - old gecko , the oldest - known mushroom and fern have all been unearthed preserved in amber .
Mark Wright , WWF 's conservation science adviser said : " These exciting finds reinforce just how little we now about the world around us .
In the Eastern Himalayas we have a region of extraordinary beauty and with some of the most biologically rich areas on the planet .
Ironically , it is also one of the regions most at risk from climate change , as evidenced by the rapid retreat of the glaciers , and only time will tell how well species will be able to adapt – if at all . "
If you want a clear sign that we ’ve lost control of the bailout of the financial sector , look no further than the news that General Electric has been approved to take itself out of the US government - backed debt program .
Under the program — which is officially known as the Temporary Liquidity Guarantee Program — GE has borrowed billions of dollars insured by the FDIC .
The upper limit of the guaranteed debt was an astronomical $ 126 billion .
Now it ’s being brought down to $ 75 billion .
So does this mean taxpayers are off the hook ?
Hardly
" The market knows the U.S. government will stand behind GE and GE Capital if necessary , " Mirko Mikelic , a portfolio manager at Fifth Third Asset Management , tells Reuters .
" It removes any U.S. government oversight while keeping the implicit guarantee . "
You see , even though GE is n’t officially borrowing under the TLGP , the market understands that it is bound to be bailed out if trouble strikes again .
We ’re trapped in a bailout policy whether we want it or not .
The photos of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed were taken six years apart
The first images of alleged al - Qaeda mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed at Guantanamo Bay have appeared on the internet .
Mr Mohammed appears with a long beard and wearing a white robe in the photos , taken in July by the Red Cross at the US detention centre in Cuba .
In February the US military began to allow the Red Cross to take pictures of inmates to send to their families .
Mr Mohammed had admitted planning the 9/11 attacks , the US military says .
What 's problematic for me is it really humanises the guy
Jarret Brachman
Terrorism researcher
Profile : Al - Qaeda ' kingpin '
Apart from courtroom sketches made during Mr Mohammed 's hearings , these are the first images of him to emerge since a widely distributed picture taken upon his capture in Pakistan in March 2003 .
The International Committee of the Red Cross said it took the most recent photos in July .
It said the pictures were sent to Mr Mohammed 's family and were not intended for public release .
But the images have appeared in recent days on extremist websites , according to Jarret Brachman , former research director at the Combating Terrorism Center of the West Point US Military Academy .
He said the images - which emerge on the eve of the eighth anniversary of the 9/11 attacks - could inspire extremists .
" What 's problematic for me is it really humanises the guy , " Mr Brachman told AP news agency .
Mr Mohammed 's trial is currently on hold while President Barack Obama , who has said he wants to close the Guantanamo detention centre by January , decides how to continue military prosecutions for some detainees .

Another major multiteam trade might be looming in the NBA with the Portland Trail Blazers , Utah Jazz and Chicago Bulls having discussed a deal that would be headlined by Carlos Boozer and Kirk Hinrich , according to NBA front - office sources .
Sources stressed to ESPN.com that no deal was imminent Thursday and that both Portland and Utah are still evaluating additional trade scenarios .
But two sources with knowledge of the three - team proposal confirmed that there have been substantive talks aimed at landing Boozer in Chicago , Hinrich in Portland and Tyrus Thomas in Utah .
A deal featuring those main components would deliver the elite low - post scorer that the Bulls have been chasing for years in Boozer while also positioning them to have significant salary - cap space for the summer of 2010 to court Chicago native Dwyane Wade or Chris Bosh in free agency , since Boozer is entering the final year of his contract .
The Detroit Pistons , meanwhile , continue to be widely mentioned as a trade suitor for Boozer .
Sources with knowledge of Detroit 's thinking insisted again Friday that the Pistons have not yet entered the trade bidding for the Team USA power forward , partially because they think Tayshaun Prince and newly signed Charlie Villanueva will complement each other better than Boozer and Villanueva would , especially on defense .
But it remains possible that Pistons ' inability to sign Orlando - bound Brandon Bass will lead them to re-consider .
The revamped Pistons have no dependable low - post scorer and are seeking to add size to their front line , with Boozer 's expiring contract -- as it would in Chicago -- affording them the added bonus of potentially creating salary - cap space again next summer after Detroit had the most spending money in the league this summer .
Hinrich , meanwhile , is a lead guard that Blazers general manager Kevin Pritchard has been known to covet for some time as a potential backcourt mate for Brandon Roy .
Although it was not immediately clear how many players Portland would be required to surrender in such a deal , sources say that names mentioned include Travis Outlaw , Steve Blake and Martell Webster .
Jazz general manager Kevin O'Connor declined comment to The Salt Lake Tribune when asked about the talks .
Bulls general manager Gar Forman did not offer specifics but told the Chicago Sun -Times : '' There are always conversations going on , and we 'll continue to talk to teams to see if we can make ourselves better . "
For a time Wednesday , sources say Chicago was committed to participate in the four - team deal that ultimately sent Shawn Marion to Dallas , with veteran forward Tim Thomas also headed for the Mavericks .
One source said that the Bulls pulled Thomas out of that deal Wednesday night to plug him into another trade , but there was no clear indication Thursday if that was with Boozer in mind or if the Bulls have other plans for him .
Other players would likely be needed to complete any three - way deal involving Chicago , Portland and Utah for salary - cap reasons , but it is becoming increasingly evident that Utah -- even if a Boozer - to - Chicago concept goes no further -- is prepared to move the Team USA forward this summer to increase its financial flexibility to re-sign restricted free agent Paul Millsap .
Pritchard acknowledged Friday afternoon in a session with local reporters that he is also weighing whether to extend an offer sheet to Millsap , but he offered no timetable when asked how soon the Blazers -- who have just under $ 8 million in salary - cap space -- will make their first splash of the offseason .
" We 're looking at all our options , " Pritchard said .
" We 're excited about all the possibilities and maybe they happen tomorrow , maybe they happen in two months , maybe they happen at the trade deadline . "
As for Millsap specifically , Pritchard said : " I would n't just say that we 're just looking at him .
We are talking with him .
That I can verify .
But he 's not the only person we 're talking to . "
Pritchard also addressed a report in Thursday 's Oregonian newspaper that talks negotiations on contract extensions for franchise cornerstones Roy and forward LaMarcus Aldridge have stalled .
" It 's amicable , " he said .
" We plan to make it amicable .
More importantly , Brandon and LaMarcus will be here for a long time . "
After injuries restricted him to just 37 games last season , Boozer has only one season left with Utah at $ 12.7 million , having declined the option in his contract to become an unrestricted free agent July 1 .
It 's believed that the Jazz are determined to keep Millsap but are concerned about the luxury - tax consequences of signing him to a long - term deal .
Marc Stein and Chad Ford are senior NBA writers for ESPN.com .

SYDNEY invented the Free Hugs Man and now the city has a $ 1 - for - a - kiss seller .
Eligible young bachelor Lachlan Christie , 24 , is selling smooches outside the Queen Victoria Building in the heart of Sydney 's CBD .
The street performer , who hides his eyes behind shades , has been spruiking kisses for two weeks and usually aims to take home $ 5 to $ 10 per day .
" I 've sold three kisses in the past 50 minutes , " he said .
" I 'm doing it as a social experiment to get a chance to see people 's reactions . ''
He said women were quite reluctant to receive kisses on the lips .
" I want some brave girls to come up , " he said .
" A lot of people want to give me money but do n't want a kiss . "
Christie said he was currently single but was n't necessarily trying to find a girlfriend .
" It 's mainly for the reaction ... to break down boundaries and challenge social norms , " he said .
" Once I get more well known , hopefully business will boom .
" It 's great toeing the line of whether people think you 're serious or not . "
He said he was a big fan of public comedy and got the idea for his business from Sydney 's Free Hugs Man .
A Sydney man known by the pseudonym Juan Mann started the " Free Hugs " movement at the CBD 's Pitt St Mall in 2004 , and the phenomenon soon went worldwide .
Mann even appeared on US talk show Oprah .
Disclaimer :
The reporter purchased a $ 1 kiss in exchange for this story and enjoyed it .

One of the hottest topics at this year ’s XXVIIth General Assembly of the International Astronomical Union ( IAU ) in Rio de Janeiro , Brazil involves the study of the astrophysical conditions favourable for the development and survival of primordial life .
New research shows that compared to middle - aged stars like the Sun , newly formed stars spin faster generating strong magnetic fields that result in emission of more intense levels of X - rays , ultraviolet rays and charged particles ― all of which could wreak havoc on budding atmospheres and have a dramatic effect on the development of emerging life forms .
Just how rare life is in the Universe is one of the key questions in the natural sciences today .
By pulling in multidisciplinary expertise from biology , geology , physics and astronomy , astrobiologists are addressing different facets of this very profound question , and notably how the conditions around different types of stars in an early stage of development might help or hinder the emergence of life in a solar system .
Several scientists at the forefront of this research have just concluded IAU Symposium 264 on " Solar and Stellar Variability ― impact on Earth and Planets " .
The Sun is awe - inspiring and fearsome ― a superheated ball about 300,000 times as heavy as the Earth , radiating immense amounts of energy and hurling great globs of hot plasma millions of kilometres out into space .
The intense radiation from this giant powerhouse would be fatal close to the Sun , but for a planet like Earth , orbiting at a safe distance from these violent outbursts , and bathed by a gentler radiation , the Sun can provide the steady energy supply needed to sustain life .
Now sedate and middle - aged , at around 4.5 billion years old , the Sun 's wild youth is behind it .
Edward Guinan , a professor of astronomy and astrophysics at Villanova University in the USA , and his " Sun - in - Time " project team have studied stars that are analogues of the Sun at both early and late stages of its lifecycle .
These " solar proxies " enable scientists to look through a window in time to see the harsh conditions prevailing in the early or future Solar System , as well as in planetary systems around other stars .
These studies could lead to profound insights into the origin of life on Earth and reveal how likely ( or unlikely ) the rise of life is elsewhere in the cosmos .
This work has revealed that the Sun rotated more than ten times faster in its youth ( over four billion years ago ) than today .
The faster a star rotates , the harder the magnetic dynamo at its core works , generating a stronger magnetic field , so the young Sun emitted X - rays and ultraviolet radiation up to several hundred times stronger than the Sun today .
A team led by Jean - Mathias Grießmeier from ASTRON in the Netherlands looked at another type of magnetic fields ― that around planets .
They found that the presence of planetary magnetic fields plays a major role in determining the potential for life on other planets as they can protect against the effects of both short - lived intense particle storms when the star ejects mass from its corona and the persistent onslaught of particles from the stellar wind .
Grießmeier says : " Planetary magnetic fields are important for two reasons : they protect the planet against the incoming charged particles , thus preventing the planetary atmosphere from being blown away , and also act as a shield against high energy cosmic rays .
The lack of an intrinsic magnetic field may be the reason why today Mars does not have an atmosphere " .
Guinan explains a surprising realisation that emerged from their work : " The Sun does not seem like the perfect star for a system where life might arise .
Although it is hard to argue with the Sun's ‘ success ' as it so far is the only star known to host a planet with life , our studies indicate that the ideal stars to support planets suitable for life for tens of billions of years may be a smaller slower burning ‘ orange dwarf ' with a longer lifetime than the Sun ― about 20 - 40 billion years .
These stars , also called K stars , are stable stars with a habitable zone that remains in the same place for tens of billions of years .
They are 10 times more numerous than the Sun , and may provide the best potential habitat for life in the long run " .
He continues : " On the more speculative side we have also found indications that planets like Earth are also not necessarily the best suited for life to thrive .
Planets two to three times more massive than the Earth , with a higher gravity , can retain the atmosphere better .
They may have a larger liquid iron core giving a stronger magnetic field that protects against the early onslaught of cosmic rays .
Furthermore , a larger planet cools more slowly and maintains its magnetic protection .
This kind of planet may be more likely to harbour life .
I would not trade though ― you can't argue with success " .
Manfred Cuntz , an associate professor of physics at the University of Texas at Arlington , USA , and his collaborators have examined both the damaging and the favourable effects of ultraviolet radiation from stars on DNA molecules .
This allows them to study the effect on other potential carbon - based extraterrestrial life forms in the habitable zones around other stars .
Cuntz says : " The most significant damage associated with ultraviolet light occurs from UV-C , which is produced in enormous quantities in the photosphere of hotter F - type stars and further out , in the chromospheres , of cooler orange K - type and red M - type stars .
Our Sun is an intermediate , yellow G - type star .
The ultraviolet and cosmic ray environment around a star may very well have ‘ chosen ' what type of life could arise around it " .
Rocco Mancinelli , an astrobiologist with the Search for Extraterrestrial Life ( SETI ) Institute in the USA , observes that as life arose on Earth at least 3.5 billion years ago , it must have withstood a barrage of intense solar ultraviolet radiation for a billion years before the oxygen released by these life forms formed the protective ozone layer .
Mancinelli studies DNA to delve into some of the ultraviolet protection strategies that evolved in early life forms and still persist in a recognisable form today .
As any life in other planetary systems must also contend with radiation from their host stars , these methods for repairing and protecting organisms from ultraviolet damage serve as models for life beyond Earth .
Mancinelli says
" We also see ultraviolet radiation as a kind of selection mechanism .
All three domains of life that exist today have common ultraviolet protection strategies such as a DNA repair mechanism and sheltering in water or in rocks .
Those that did not were likely wiped out early on " .
The scientists agree that we do yet know how ubiquitous or how fragile life is , but as Guinan concludes : " The Earth 's period of habitability is nearly over ― on a cosmological timescale .
In a half to one billion years the Sun will start to be too luminous and warm for water to exist in liquid form on Earth , leading to a runaway greenhouse effect in less than 2 billion years " .
In a new GRL paper , Svensmark et al. , claim that liquid water content in low clouds is reduced after Forbush decreases ( FD ) , and for the most influential FD events , the liquid water content in the oceanic atmosphere can diminish by as much as 7 % .
In particular , they argue that there is a substantial decline in liquid water clouds , apparently tracking a declining flux of galactic cosmic rays ( GCR ) , reaching a minimum days after the drop in GCR levels .
The implication would be that GCR can affect climate through modulating the low - level cloudiness .
The analysis is based on various remote sensing products .
The hypothesis is this : a rapid reduction in GCR , due to FD , results in reduced ionization of the atmosphere , and hence less cloud drops and liquid water in low clouds .
Their analysis of various remote sensing products suggest that the opacitiy ( measured in terms of the Angstrom exponent ) due to aerosols reaches a minimum ~ 5 days after FD , and that there is a minimum in the cloud liquid water content ( CWC ) minimum occurring ~ 7 days later than the FD .
They also observe that the CWC minimum takes place ~ 4 days after the fine aerosol minimum ( the numbers here do n’t seem to add up ) .
The paper is based on a small selection of events and specific choice of events and bandwidths .
The paper does n’t provide any proof that GCR affect the low clouds– at best - , but can at most only give support to this hypothesis .
There are still a lot of hurdles that remain before one can call it a proof .
One requirement for successful scientific progress in general , is that new explanations or proposed mechanisms must fit within the big picture , as well as being consistent with other observations .
They must also be able to explain other relevant aspects .
A thorough understanding of the broader subject is therefore often necessary to put the new pieces in the larger context .
It ’s typical of non-experts not to place their ideas in the context of the bigger picture .
If we look at the big picture , one immediate question is why it should take days for the alleged minimum in CWC to be visible ?
The lifetime of clouds is usually thought to be on the order of hours , and it is likely that most of the CWC has precipitated out or re-evaporated within a day after the cloud has formed .
In this context , the FD is supposed to suppress the formation of new cloud condensation nuclei ( CCN ) , and the time lag of the response must reflect the life time of the clouds and the time it takes for new ultra - fine molecule clusters ( tiny aerosols ) to grow to CCN .
Next question is then , why the process , through which ultra - fine molecule clusters grow by an order of ~1000 to become CCN , takes place over several days while the clouds themselves have a shorter life time ?
There is also a recent study in GRL ( also a comment on May 1st , 2009 in Science ) by Pierce and Adams on modeling CCN , which is directly relevant to Svensmark et al .
‘s hypothesis , but not cited in their paper .
Pierce and Adams argue that the theory is not able to explain the growth from tiny molecule clusters to CCN .
Thus , the work by Svensmark et al. is not very convincing if they do not discuss these issues , on which their hypothesis hinges , even if the paper by Pierce and Adams was too recent for being included in this paper .
But Svensmark et al. also fail to make reference to another relevant paper by Erlykin et al. ( published January 2009 ) , which argues that any effect on climate is more likely to be directly from solar activity rather than GCR , because the variations in GCR lag variations in temperature .
Furthermore , there are two recent papers in the Philosophical Transactions A of the Royal Society , ‘ Enhancement of cloud formation by droplet charging ‘ and ‘ Discrimination between cosmic ray and solar irradiance effects on clouds , and evidence for geophysical modulation of cloud thickness ‘ , that are relevant for this study .
Both support the notion that GCR may affect the cloudiness , but in different aspects to the way Svensmark et al. propose .
The first of these studies focuses on time scales on the order of minutes and hours , rather than days .
It is difficult to explain how the changes in the current densities taking place minutes to hours after solar storms may have a lasting effect of 4 - 9 days .
There are many micro-physical processes known to be involved in the low clouds , each affecting the cloud droplet spectra , CWC and the cloud life times .
Such processes include collision & coalescence , mixing processes , winds , phase changes , heat transfer ( e.g. , diffusive and radiative ) , chemical reactions , precipitation , and effects from temperature .
The ambient temperature determines the balance between the amount of liquid water and that of water vapour .
On a more technical side , the paper did not communicate well why 340 nm and 440 nm should the magic numbers for the remote sensing data and the Angstrom exponents , calculated from the Aerosol Robotic Network ( AERONET ) .
There are also measurements for other wavelengths , and Svensmark et al . do not explain why these particular choices are best for the type of aerosols they want to study .
For a real effect , one would expect to see a response in the whole chain of the CCN - formation , from the smallest to the largest aerosols .
So , what about the particles of other sizes ( or different Angstrom exponents ) than those Svensmark et al. have examined ?
Are they affected in the same way , or is there a reason to believe that the particles grow in jumps and spurts ?
If one looks long enough at a large set of data , it is often possible to discern patterns just by chance .
For instance , ancient scholars thought they found meaningful patterns in the constellations of the stars on the sky .
Svensmark et al. selected a smaller number of FDs than Kristjansson et al. ( published in 2008 ) who found no clear effect of GCR on cloudiness .
Also , statistics based on only 26 data points or only 5 events as presented in the paper is bound to involve a great deal of uncertainty , especially in a noisy environment such as the atmosphere .
It is important to ask : Could the similarities arise from pure coincidence ?
Applying filtering to the data can sometimes bias the results .
Svensmark et al. applied a Gaussian smooth with a width of 2 days and max 10 days to reduce fluctuations .
But did it reduce the ‘ right ’ fluctuations ?
If the aerosols need days to form CCNs and hence clouds , would n’t there be an inherent time scale of several days ?
And is this accounted for in the Monte - Carlo simulations they carried out to investigate the confidence limits ?
By limiting the minimum to take place in the interval 0 - 20 days after FD , and defining the base reference to 15 to 5 days before FD , a lot is already given .
How sensitive are the results to these choices ?
The paper does not explore this .
For a claimed ‘ FD strength of 100 %’ ( whatever that means ) the change in cloud fraction was found to be on the order 4 % +- 2 % which , they argue , is ‘ slightly larger than the changes observed during a solar cycle ’ of ~ 2 % .
This is not a very precise statement .
And when the FD only is given in percentage , it ’s difficult to check the consistency of the numbers .
E.g. is there any consistency between the changes in the level of GCR between solar min and max and cloud fraction and during FD ?
And how does cloud fraction relate with CWC ?
Svensmark et al. used the south pole neutron monitor to define the FD , with a cut - off rigidity at 0.06GV that also is sensitive to the low - energy particles from space .
Higher energies are necessary for GCR to reach the lower latitudes on Earth , and the flux tends to diminish with higher energy .
Hence , the south pole monitor is not necessarily a good indicator for higher - energy GCR that potentially may influence stratiform clouds in the low latitudes .
In their first figure , they show a composite of the 5 strongest FD events .
But how robust are these results ?
Does an inclusion of the 13 strongest FD events or only the 3 leading events alter the picture ?
Svensmark et al. claim that the results are statistically significant at the 5 % - level , but for the quantitative comparison ( their 2nd figure ) of effect of the FD magnitude in each of the four data sets studied , it is clear that there is a strong scatter and that the data points do not lie neatly on a line .
Thus , it looks as if the statistical test was biased , because the fit is not very impressive .
The GRL paper claims to focus on maritime clouds , but it is reasonable to question if this is true as the air moves some distance in 4 - 9 days ( the time between the FD and the minimum in CWC ) due to the winds .
This may suggest that the initial ionization probably takes place over other regions than where the CWC minima are located 4 — 9 days afterward .
It would be more convincing if the study accounted for the geographical patterns and the advection by the winds .
Does the width of the minimum peak reveal time scales associated with the clouds ?
The shape of the minimum suggests that some reduction starts shortly after the FD , which then reaches a minimum after several days .
For some data , however , the reduction phase is slower , for others the recovery phase is slower .
The width of the minimum is 7 - 12 days .
Do these variations exhibit part of the uncertainty of the analysis , or is there some real information there ?
The paper does not discuss the lack of trend in the GCR of moderate energy levels or which role GCR plays for climate change .
They have done that before ( see previous posts here , here , and here ) , and it ’s wise to leave out statements which do not have scientific support .
But it seems they look for ways to back up their older claim , and news report and the press release on their paper make the outrageous claim that GCR have been demonstrated to play an important role in recent global warming .
A recent analysis carried out by myself and Gavin , and published in JGR , compares the response to solar forcing between the GISS GCM ( ER ) and the observations .
Our analysis suggests that the GCM provides a realistic response in terms of the global mean temperature – well within the bounds of uncertainty , as uncertainties are large when applying linear methods to analyse chaotic systems .
The model does not include the GCR mechanism , and the general agreement between model and observations therefore is consistent with the effect of GCR on clouds being minor in terms of global warming .
As an aside to this issue , there has been some new developements regarding GCR , galaxy dynamics and our climate ( see the commentary environmentalresearchweb.org ) – discussed previously here .
Engels : A Revolutionary Life , by John Green , Artery Publications , 2008 .
Marx ’s General : The Revolutionary Life of Friedrich Engels , by Tristram Hunt , Macmillan / Metropolitan , 2009 .
( First published in Britain as The Frock - Coated Communist : The Revolutionary Life of Friedrich Engels . )
Reviewed by Ian Angus
August 24 , 2009 -- Socialist Voice --
Most people on the left know that Friedrich Engels was co-author of the Communist Manifesto and Karl Marx ’s lifelong collaborator .
But few of today ’s radicals know much more than that about the man who built barricades and fought a guerrilla war in Germany in the 1848 - 49 revolution , the indefatigable organiser who played a decisive role in building the Marxist current from a handful of exiles in the 1850s into the dominant trend in the international working - class movement by the time of his death in 1895 .
They can scarcely be blamed for their lack of knowledge : it has n’t been easy to learn about Engels ’ life .
In the 110 years after he died , only two substantial biographies were published in English – by Gustav Mayer in 1936 and by W.O. Henderson in 1967 – and both have long been out of print .
So socialists can only be pleased by the arrival of two new biographies of Karl Marx ’s comrade , and indeed , these books have been warmly welcomed by socialist reviewers .
However , our pleasure at the publication of two books on a neglected socialist leader should not blind us to the fact that neither is the comprehensive study that Engels really deserves .
Both are accounts of Engels ’ life – not his life and ideas .
Each discusses aspects of his political views and briefly summarises some of his major works , but neither does so in detail .
That ’s a serious weakness in biographies of a man who , as Green writes , “ enjoyed nothing more than a lively debate , the clash of ideas and argument ” .
We can hope that other writers will correct the balance , but for now these are the most accessible accounts we have of Engels ’ life .
They cover similar ground , of course , but they differ in emphasis .
Green focuses on Engels as a builder and leader of the revolutionary left , while Hunt stresses his personal life , particularly the personal and political sacrifices he made to support Marx .
Engels : A Revolutionary Life
All by itself , John Green ’s account of Engels ’ involvement in the 1848 - 49 revolutions in France and Germany make Engels : A Revolutionary Life worth reading .
Anyone who thinks of Engels only as a grey - bearded socialist elder will be surprised and inspired by this account of a twenty - something activist who put his life on the line for his ideas .
Green also describes Engels ’ role in building and guiding the international socialist movement in the last two decades of his life .
From his home in London , Engels kept up a voluminous correspondence in multiple languages – he prided himself on always responding in the languages of his correspondents – answering questions , advising and criticising .
Green is critical of the role Marx and Engels played in debates in the workers ' movement , complaining of their “ almost pathological resistance ” to ideas other than their own .
In their intolerance of differing approaches to creating the basis for a socialist society and their vituperative lashing of those who think differently , one can see the germ of the sectarian in - fighting , the dogmatism and intolerance of dissent that will plague communist movements of the twentieth century .
And yet Green admits that what he calls their “ perpetual cavilling and proffering of advice ” to the German socialists did “ persuade the party eventually to adopt many of their fundamental principles ” .
Obviously Marx and Engels were doing something right !
What Green fails to understand is that far from presaging the sectarianism of later grouplets , in most of these disputes Marx and Engels were arguing against the sectarians of their day .
They were intolerant of those who tried to divert the workers ’ movement onto side roads and dead ends , and they argued strongly that “ every step of real movement is more important than a dozen programmes ” .
Green says that his goal was to “ rescue the man Friedrich Engels from the suffocating embrace of academia and to remove the layers of clutter and detailed overload that have kept him hidden ” .
Despite its political limitations , Engels : A Revolutionary
Life largely does that , providing a valuable portrait of a man who committed himself to the revolutionary cause in his early 20s and never looked back .
US edition .
Marx ’s General
From a strictly political perspective , the strongest part of Marx ’s General , which was published in England as The Frock - Coated Communist , is its discussion of the philosophical debates in Germany in the early 1840s .
Hunt ’s account of the intense intellectual ferment from which Marxism emerged is the clearest and most concise I ’ve read .
But his main focus is “ the rich contradiction and limitless sacrifice which marked [ Engels ' ] long life ” – in particular , the years from 1851 to 1869 , when Engels was employed in his family ’s cotton business , doing work he hated intensely , in order to support Marx while the latter researched and wrote Capital .
For nearly 19 years , Engels held his tongue in Manchester business circles during long working days , while meeting ( and carousing ) with socialists and other working - class militants late into the night .
Hunt , it must be said , sees this as a greater contradiction than Engels himself did , but his account does illuminate just how committed Engels was to his and Marx ’s joint lifetime project .
Hunt ’s focus on Engels ’ personal life occasionally leads him into sensationalism .
As a young man in France and Belgium , Engels wrote that he enjoyed the company of “ grisettes ” , which Hunt inaccurately translates as “ prostitutes ” .
Grisettes were actually young working - class women , mainly in the garment industry , who were active in bohemian and left circles .
As in the 1960s , an open attitude towards sex was common in the European left in the 1840s , but only conservative prigs and prudes – people Engels detested – equated sexual freedom with prostitution .
Like Green , but with much greater indignation , Hunt repeats the often - told story that Marx had an illegitimate son in 1851 , and that Engels pretended to be the father to protect Marx ’s marriage .
Only a reader who goes to the sources cited in Hunt ’s footnotes will learn that the entire story is based on one letter written by an unreliable witness in 1898 – and that other evidence makes the story unlikely .
( See http://marxmyths.org/terrell-carver/article.htm.)
Fortunately , salacious gossip does n’t dominate Marx ’s General , which in total shows a very human and humane man who loved good companions , good food , good drink and great ideas – a man whose life gives the lie to reactionary claims that socialists are cheerless fanatics .
Engels versus Marx ?
In the 20th century , Engels was frequently accused of revising , watering down , or otherwise corrupting Marxism .
Depending on which critic you read , Engels was guilty of being too Hegelian or not Hegelian enough , of excessive scientism or not understanding science , of responsibility for social - democratic electoralism or for Stalinist totalitarianism .
As Sebastiano Timpanaro wrote in 1970 , it seems that radical academics always start by blaming Engels for the parts of Marxism they disagree with :
In all of these operations , there is a need for somebody on whom everything which Marxists , at that particular moment , are asking to get rid of can be dumped .…
Marx turns out to be free of all these vices , provided one knows how to ‘ read ’ him .
It was Engels who , in his zeal to simplify and vulgarize Marxism , contaminated it .
( On Materialism )
Since neither of the new biographies tries to provide a thorough account of Engels ’ ideas , it is n’t surprising that neither deals in depth with such charges .
John Green is agnostic on the issue .
He accurately describes the Marx - Engels relationship as “ a close and long - term collaboration … an apparently perfect symbiosis ” , but promptly qualifies that by reporting that nevertheless “ there are those who claim to recognise significant and far - reaching differences between the thinking of the two men ” .
He summarises some critics ’ views , but does n’t evaluate their criticisms .
Would Marx have agreed with what Engels wrote in his controversial Dialectics of Nature ?
Green just says “ we can never know ” .
Surprisingly , given that his main interest is Engels ’ personality and lifestyle , Tristram Hunt handles this issue much more decisively .
He insists that Anti-Dühring , often singled out as proof that Engels misunderstood Marxism , is “ the expression of authentic , mature Marxist opinion ” , and he ridicules the claim some have made that Marx remained silent about Engels ’ errors in order to keep his friendship :
Whatever mechanical revisions happened to Marxism in the twentieth century , it is a misreading of the Marx - Engels relationship to suggest either that Engels knowingly corrupted Marxian theory or that Marx had such a fragile friendship with him that he ( Karl Marx ! ) could not bear to express a disagreement .
There is no evidence that Marx was ashamed or concerned about the nature of Engels ’ popularization of Marxism .
We ’ll have to wait for a comprehensive defence of Engels , but for now , this response is right on the mark .
Which ‘ life ’ to choose ?
After decades in which there was no life of Engels in print in English , suddenly there are two , with different strengths .
Neither is perfect , but both will help to move Engels out of Marx ’s shadow and into centre stage where he belongs .
Hunt is an effective writer whose portrait of Engels really brings the man to life .
Still , Engels was above all a political thinker and activist , so Hunt ’s repeated dismissals of political disputes as pointless squabbling reveal a serious lack of sympathy with his subject .
That ’s also reflected in his improbable conclusion that Engels would have supported Russia ’s Mensheviks against Lenin .
Green is much better on Engels ’ role as a revolutionary activist and movement builder , and he devotes more time to Engels ’ ideas , although not always insightfully .
Unfortunately , his book is not as well written : the narrative jumps confusingly back and forth in time , and Green ’s decision to write entirely in the present tense is a constant distraction .
Engels : A Revolutionary Life is available from Resistance Books .
Both can be purchased from other online booksellers .

Some other socialist reviews of these books
Engels : A Revolutionary Life
Marx ’s General ( The Frock - Coated Communist )
I have always enjoyed games , and especially so computer games .
In the beginning of 1980 I played a lot of arcade games .
It cost me money , but I got intrigued by the idea to learn how to make games myself .
After an education of Master of Science , I found that my strength lay in algorithms .
The idea to let players extend the game was mainly due to that I wanted to have fun with the algorithms , and have someone else invent the story .
This was quite a stroke of luck , which I did n't realise until later .
Hi , I got an invitation from Cratylus to say something here .
He also asked me for the date of the launch of LPMud .
Unfortunately , I do n't remember myself .
I am happy to see that there is still activity around LPMud and similar applications , although I have n't been involved at all for a long time .
A good question is , why did I start this idea ?
Well , something like this :
Old memory popping up :
When I first started to distribute LPMud for free , I look in the ftp-log if someone had downloaded it .
I found an IP address , and connected to it with the default port .
And sure enough , there the game was , up and running .
I was probably inside the game before the new game administrator was there .
I think he was extremly impressed by the advanced NPC he met there ...
Of course , LPmud was never a one - man work , and most ideas were probably already available in some form elsewhere .
I had several friends ( and later on a community ) that helped me out .
Today , I think the the idea with a platform that can be freely extended is extremly powerful .
You can see the same concept at Facebook , PC , Linux / Gnu , Google Android , and soon Google Wave , Wikipedia , etc .
Even though inactive in the MUD world , I was busy gaming in related world , WoW , for several years .
Losing interest now as there really is n't happening much .
The last 15 years , I have been working with embedded software in the automotive industry .
Far away from gaming , but you have to make a living somewhere .
Actually quite fun , even if you do n't have much of a user interface .
Will I ever get tired of computer games ?
What happens to old gamers when they grow old ?
( I am not yet half way to 100 ) .
I am not sure , but I still like gaming .
However , you get more and more fastidious .
Some new games are just the same as older ones , with better graphics and sound .
I believe that Virtual Reality will continue to evolve in fantastic ways .
Raymond Kurzweil is a fan of mine , even though he might seem to be a little on the optmisitic side .
Great art stands the test of time , and demands of us a commitment commensurate with its greatness ... or , at least that 's the kind of thing I only half - ironically told myself as I pulled the trigger on the purchase of an obsolete , slightly brickish , $ 1,300 tablet PC , which I bought to turn into a portable console for classic computer RPGs .
I 'm a sucker for old - school isometric RPG titles — Temple of Elemental Evil , Icewind Dale 1 & 2 , Planescape : Torment , Baldur 's Gate 1 & 2 , Fallout 1 & 2 — because they 're true classics in every sense of the word , and when I began actively collecting used copies of them a little over a year ago , I wanted to make sure that I enjoyed them in style .
After some long searching , I found that Samsung 's overpriced " Origami " tablet PC is as close to the perfect platform for retro-RPGing as any I could imagine .
Now , you may be thinking I 'm crazy , because on today 's screens these games must look like dated , pixellated messes , so who in their right mind would spend the price of a nice Thinkpad just to be able to play one on a touchscreen tablet .
Well , by the time you 're done with this article , you 'll either understand or you wo n't , and if you are going to understand then the screenshot below will get you over halfway there .
Click on that shot , and let it fill your monitor with a breathtaking , 1680x1050 expanse of retro-PRG beauty .
When I came across the widescreen mod that was used for this screenshot at Rock , Paper , Shotgun , it blew my mind .
This mod works with all of the old Infinity Engine games , and there are similar mods for a variety of other older games .
I tried this widescreen hack out on two games running in a Windows XP VM on my MacBook Air , and it works beautifully .
Even better , what I found when I viewed these games at modern resolutions is that not only is the art very good , but many later attempts to render these isometric games in 3D were actually a huge step backwards in terms of overall visuals .
The 2D artwork in these games is great , and the smaller resolutions that the games were initially played at just were n't able to do it justice .
I had long been interested in the idea of playing these games on a touchscreen tablet , because the point - and - click interfaces seem well - suited to this type of interaction .
These RPGs are largely mouse - driven and offer fairly large click targets — character models , corpses , furniture , locations — that are easy to tap with stylus or a finger .
These older RPGs also have active fan bases that release everything from bug fixes to new NPCs to conversions .
For instance , the Gibberlings Three 's Baldur 's Gate 2 fixpack fixes a whole host of issues that even the final patch missed , including spelling and grammatical errors in the dialogue trees , erroneous item descriptions , and other glitches and kinks .
Gibberling 's
Three is just one spot where Infinity Engine RPG junkies can go to get mods and other unauthorized tweaks ; Sorcerer 's Place is also a core site for retro-RPGers , and the Planescape : Torment page offers a glimpse of the kinds of things that you can expect to find there .
Official game patches are hosted there , as are walkthroughs , guides , trailers , wallpapers , mods , and items .
Not enough rounds in a day
The minute that I figured out that there 's more than enough fan - made material out to give these classics a new lease on life , I started picking up used copies of them and making plans to play them , some of them for the first time .
But then I ran into a problem : these games are long .
For today 's games , 30 hours of play time is epic ; but old - school RPGs , could run well over 100 hours .
In fact , I spent one summer working 15 hours a week as a computer lab monitor , and pretty much all I did was play once through the Mac ports of Fallout 1 and 2 for the whole summer .
Like many thirty - something gamers , I do n't have the free time to sequester myself in a room and click away at a > 100 - hour RPG ; most of my gaming opportunities occur in travel situations , or if I 'm sitting around on the couch in the family room , keeping one eye on my daughter and stopping frequently to chat with my wife .
This being the case , my first attempt at enjoying my old - school RPG collection involved my Macbook Air and a copy of VMware .
Under virtualization , the experience was passable but not great ; and besides , it felt too much like work ( I spend my entire workday on this machine ) .
I had long been interested in the idea of playing these games on a touchscreen tablet , because the point - and - click interfaces seem well - suited to this type of interaction .
These RPGs are largely mouse - driven and offer fairly large click targets — character models , corpses , furniture , locations — that are easy to tap with stylus or a finger .
This being the case , I had toyed with the idea of getting one of the new or upcoming Windows XP netbooks with a touchscreen , but I was concerned about performance issues —
Atom is n't the speediest platform out there .
I also considered something like a Thinkpad , which is a regular laptop that converts into a tablet .
The main drawback there is that , when the laptop is in tablet mode , the entire keyboard is hidden , so you can't access hotkeys for spells and other actions .
Then I found the Samsung Q1 Ultra Premium , and it was as if the RPG gods had created the tablet specifically so that I could reach retro RPG nirvana ( or maybe Valhalla , or some outer plane whose name escapes me at the moment ) .

You gotta love this event .

And what did I see the local media taking footage of ?
Furries and people in Star Wars costumes .
So remains the face of fandom to the self - proclaimed Those With Lives .
‘ SOkay , though .
I finally met Charlie Stross in the flesh , and Jetse de Vries .
Reacquainted myself with John Scalzi , who is too nice to exist .
Bumped too infrequently into Elisabeth Bear ( and hope to rectify that in the following days ) .
Met Kim Binsted ( U Hawaii , AI dudette ) , Kathryn Myronuk ( of Sinularity U ) and Brad Templeton ( of the EFF , and author of perhaps the most articulate critique of BSG ’s failed finale I ’ve read ) .
Glenn Grant .
Nalo Hopkinson ( who made it after all ) .
Dave Williams .
Others too numerous to mention .
Panels have all gone down well so far ; the reading ( with Scalzi and Jon Courtenay Grimwood ) was a glorious triumvirate of literary nihilism full of Russian vivissectionists and flayed gods and shapeshifting rapist - missionaries ; my contribution was , if anything , the lighthearted comic relief .
Another cool quote : “ Fungi are Nature ’s Internet ” ( although I forget the attribution ) .
Not to mention the aforemention updated Turing test criterion .

Microsoft has finally gone ahead and confirmed the recent slew of rumors surrounding the Zune HD .
The Zune HD in 16GB Black and 32 GB Platinum is available now for preorder from Amazon.com , Best Buy , Wal- mart , and the Microsoft Store .
The device will be officially available on September 15 , 2009 .
ZuneOriginals.net will then offer both 16GB and 32 GB capacities in five different colors with the option to add one of 10 new engravings designed by guest artists to the back of the device .
The 16GB version will be priced at $ 220 and the 32 GB will go for $ 290 .
Microsoft 's biggest competition will undoubtedly be Apple , which currently prices its similar product significantly higher .
The 16GB iPod Touch goes for $ 300 while the 32 GB iPod Touch will set you back $ 400 .
Apple will likely slash its prices soon though , and given how pricing usually works in the iPod lineup , our guess is that the 16GB will soon go for $ 230 while the 32 GB will be at $ 300 .
Microsoft is likely expecting such a move , and if we 're right , Redmond will only be undercutting Cupertino by a mere $ 10 .
Apple currently also offers an 8GB version of the iPod Touch , and again looking back at what history has shown us , if the 16GB will take on the 8GB version 's price , and the 32GB version will take on the 16GB version 's price , the company will likely put out a 64GB version ( and the rumor mill agrees ) for $ 400 .
Microsoft does n't have a 64GB version planned for the launch of the Zune HD , though whispers claim that one is one the way .
We 've heard lots about the Zune HD , some fact , some speculation .
Now that the release is just a month away , it 's important to get official details .
Here are the six areas that Microsoft is underlining :
Built - in HD Radio receiver :
Allows you to listen to higher - quality sound than is available from traditional radio channels , as well as access additional programming through HD2 and HD3 multicast channels .
: Allows you to listen to higher - quality sound than is available from traditional radio channels , as well as access additional programming through HD2 and HD3 multicast channels .

I 'll make my report as if I told a story , for I was taught as a child on my homeworld that Truth is a matter of the imagination .
The soundest fact may fail or prevail in the style of its telling : like that singular organic jewel of our seas , which grows brighter as one woman wears it and , worn by another , dulls and goes to dust .
Facts are no more solid , coherent , round , and real than pearls are .
But both are sensitive .
I ’ll make my report as if I told a story , for I was taught as a child on my homeworld that Truth is a matter of the imagination .
Quotations
A reader writes :
Optics , not reality , is what matters .
Everything can be massaged with a Mission Accopmlished banner , a sympathetic interview on Fox News , or a whisper campaign that your opponent is a faggot .
Wilson 's catcalling was only part of it .
This is the party of Colson and Segretti , Atwater and Rove , Kristol and Norquist .
It is the party of Joe Wilson and the odious Patrick McHenry , the latter a bad caricature of a South Park or Simpsons character .
Just look at them , with the " What bill ? " signs around their necks , waving the copies of their " bill " in the President 's face as he patiently explained to them why they are so very full of shit .
Yes , the GOP of 2009 is the party of torture and fiscal recklessness .
But as Joe Wilson 's outburst last night made clear , it is every bit as much the party of the College Republicans .
Juvenile , manipulative , impossibly smarmy , hateful - or at least more than willing to use the weapon of other people 's hate - and , above all , relentlessly cynical .
To these ( mostly ) men , politics is not the " art of the possible " , not a means for peaceably grappling with the most difficult and complex issues of the day , or for attempting to improve the lives of people you will never meet .
It is nothing but a game , one where the object is not just to win but to destroy your enemies with a weird mix of angry slander and junior high insults - and to have a good chuckle while admiring your handiwork .
It is an attitude that enables one to label a respected judge who worked with disadvantaged children a pedophile ( as Rove 's minions did in an Alabama Supreme Court race in 1994 ) , or to put Sarah Palin on a presidential ticket .
Just as for the neocons it is always 1938 , for the professional College Republicans in the House GOP , it is always the annual convention , with the hotly - contested race for treasurer or secretary between one guy from Michigan State and another from Clemson .
Accusations of fraud abound , frat boys and bookworms alike go berserk as they see their chances of interning with the RNC slip away , and desperate calls are made to worshipped alumni with the hope that some measure of revenge can be exacted .
Nerd libido harnessed to cynical rage .
Welcome to the House the College Republicans Built .
For our benefit , President Obama is more than happy to let them live in it .
Enlarge NASA / AFP / Getty Images U.S. astronaut Tom Marshburn , lower right , tightens some bolts outside the International Space Station .
Astronauts from space shuttle Endeavour ventured into open space on the mission 's second spacewalk aimed at helping complete the International Space Station .
CAPE CANAVERAL ( AP ) 
The astronauts aboard the shuttle - station complex celebrated the 40th anniversary of man 's first moon landing with their own spacewalk Monday , heading outside to stockpile some big spare parts .
In the second outing of their mission , David Wolf and Thomas Marshburn anchored a 6 - foot dish antenna on the international space station for future use , then did the same with a hefty pump and an engine for a rail car .
The spacewalk unfolded 40 years to the day that two other astronauts — Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin — strolled the moon 's dusty surface .
It was the 202nd spacewalk by Americans since the Apollo 11 lunar excursion .
Inside Mission Control , a clock counted down to 4:17 p.m. ET , the moment the Eagle set down on the Sea of Tranquility on July 20 , 1969 .
It was n't until two hours later , as the spacewalk was ending , that the astronauts made note of this " special day . "
Earlier in the day at a Washington news conference , some of the Apollo astronauts , including Aldrin , suggested the $ 100 billion poured into the space station had not yielded much and that the outpost would be better used as a testbed for human missions to Mars and even asteroids .
" We 've spent a lot of money up there for almost nothing , " said Apollo 13 commander Jim Lovell .
" It 's almost a white elephant and until we can really get a return on our investment of that particular project , then it was money wasted . "
Meanwhile , the $ 15.6 million space station toilet that broke down Sunday was up and running again , after the crew added some new parts .
The commode — one of three on the linked station and shuttle Endeavour — was out of action for about 24 hours .
NASA wanted the station commode working again as soon as possible .
With a record number of people on board — 13 — having three working toilets is crucial .
Complicating matters was the fact that Endeavour cannot eject any waste water while it 's docked to the space station .
The water would spray all over the porch attached two days ago to the Japanese lab , and possibly corrode it .
With the toilet fixed , there was no longer any worry about coming close to filling Endeavour 's waste water tank .
There were a few moments of concern midway through the seven - hour spacewalk , however , when Marshburn reported that one of the hooks on his safety tethers was not anchored to the station .
The antenna work was held up while he reeled his 85 - foot tether back out , trying not to drag the line against critical equipment .
Despite everything , he remained connected to the station the entire time .
The antenna and other spare parts that were attached to the space station were hauled up by Endeavour .
It was grueling work for the spacewalkers because of the tight clearances .
NASA wants to have as many extra pieces up there as possible so that when the shuttles stop flying next year , the station will be able to get along without their big deliveries .
None of the other spacecraft that visits the outpost can hold nearly as much cargo as the shuttle .
Monday 's spacewalk was much quieter than the one Saturday .
Loud static filled the airwaves throughout the earlier excursion , the result of improperly positioned microphones in an astronaut 's helmet .
The cap with those microphones will not be used again .
Three more spacewalks are planned during Endeavour 's station visit , which ends July 28 .

FAULENSEE , Switzerland  Kurt Klopfenstein has been fishing the waters off this Alpine village for over 30 years , but the object he dug out of his nets not long ago , in among the whitefish , perch , trout and pike , was like nothing he had ever pulled out before .
A hand grenade , slimy to the touch but easily recognizable .
“ I gingerly tossed it back overboard , ” he said , setting his nets from his rocking rowboat one recent evening .
It is a wonder a catch like Mr. Klopfenstein ’s does not happen more often around here .
For in the decades following World War II , the Swiss dumped more than 9,000 tons of munitions into the deep waters of Lake Thun , which stretch out placidly from this village .
Neutral Switzerland stockpiled the munitions  artillery shells , hand grenades , ordinary bullets and other ordnance  during the war in the event of an invasion by Nazi Germany or Fascist Italy , which never came about .
Some caches included matériel seized from trains crossing from Germany into Italy in violation of neutrality agreements .
In the years up to 1964 the munitions were disposed of by simply dumping them into at least four Alpine lakes , with Lake Thun , an 11 - mile - long body of water that is 700 feet deep in places , getting by far the lion ’s share , at least 9,020 tons .
CANNABIS CULTURE – Join the 2009 ‘ The Worldwide Rally For The Prince of Pot ’ , and show your support for Marc Emery , the marijuana activist who is going to jail in the United States for FIVE YEARS for selling marijuana seeds and funding the cannabis movement .
This is the 2009 rally page .
For the Saturday , September 18th 2010 worldwide rally page , go here .
Marc is expected to surrender into custody at the BC Supreme Court on Monday , September 28 , 2009 .
He will remain in Canadian custody until extradited by the Canadian Justice Minister , when he will be sent to he USA to be sentenced in a Seattle federal court by judge Ricardo Martinez .
The plea agreement is for a 5 - year sentence in US Federal Prison .
The global rallies in support of Marc happened on Saturday , September 19th — join the Facebook page !
Marc Emery is a well - known activist , Vancouver retail store owner , and editor of Cannabis Culture Magazine .
He was raided by Canadian police and the US DEA on July 29th , 2005 , and arrested for selling marijuana seeds over the Internet .
On September 10th 2005 , over 40 demonstrations were held around the world to protest Marc ’s arrest for extradition to the United States .
Locations included Moscow , Prague , Wellington , Sydney , Mexico City , Paris , and London .
Marc Emery , Cannabis Culture and WhyProhibtion.ca are calling for worldwide protests once again to bring attention to his cause and situation .
In Canada , Marc would like his supporters from every community in the country to hold a rally at their local Government of Canada building .
The government of Canada is responsible for the marijuana prohibition , as well as signing off on Marc ’s extradition .
We are hoping for organizers to come forward to host major rallies in support of Marc at US consulates in Vancouver , Calgary , Toronto , Montreal , Halifax , and the US Embassy in Ottawa .
( Vancouver , BC Location : Vancouver Art Gallery at 750 Hornby Street from 2 pm - 5 pm )
In the United States , we hope for a rally in all 50 States in as many cities and towns at Canadian Consulates , local courthouses , DEA offices , Justice Department offices , or a main intersections for maximum visibility to your community .
Across the globe , we hope for a rally in every country we can find a supporter to lead a rally , wherever on the earth they may be , at Canadian embassies or consulates , courthouses , or main intersections .
Help by planning a rally and organizing with others in their community .
Please contact Cannabis Culture ( 604-689-0590 ) or Marc and Jeremiahs directly ( [ email protected ] and [ email protected ] ) if you would like to organize and host the event or if you want to know who to contact in your area .

Marc Emery writes :
Pick the place for the rally first .
The main courthouse in town is a good place .
A busy intersection where you will be seen , or on the sidewalk by any US or Canadian embassy or consulate or a federal building on a main avenue are excellent rally sites .
You do n’t need any permits .
Posters & signs should be prepared and the rally should start at 2.00 pm and go to 5 pm .
Chants should be developed ; like “ Free Marc Emery ” , “ No Prison For Pot ” , “ No More Drug War ” , “ Stop the violence , end prohibition ” , “ Register to vote , Win the Right To Toke ” and , well , you ’ll think of many , they are fun .
But practice them before hand .
Make your signs legible and clear , check spelling beforehand .
People walking with signs while chanting slogans of cannabis liberation is fine for the whole 2 or 3 hours , but you can add speakers every 20 minutes or so to change it up .
Campaigning for Ron Paul in 2007 , I learned that a sign saying “ Google Ron Paul ” was very effective in drawing passers - by attention to his videos or philosophy .
A sign at each rally saying “ Google Marc Emery and his work for freedom ” or something like that will be helpful in expanding awareness .
Signs suggestions :
* Free Marc Emery
* Free the Prince of Pot
* Google Marc Emery
* Marc Emery = Political Prisoner
* No Prison For Prince of Pot
* Free Anti-Prohibition Activist Marc Emery
* Free Cannabis Culture Leader Marc Emery
* DEA out of __________ ( your country or town here )
* End Prohibition
* No More Drug War
* No Prison For Pot
The purpose of signs is to stir the mind of any passersby who might Google ‘ Marc Emery ’ , ‘ Prohibition ’ , or ‘ Drug War ’ .
It is important to inform your local media of the rally and its purpose , why you support Marc Emery .
Tell them the extradition of a non-violent Canadian to an American prison is WRONG !
Address the fact the DEA ( US Drug Enforcement Administration ) is in your country also , and should be expelled .
One of the under - currents of a worldwide rally , especially with substantial US participation , is to ease the anger many Canadians may feel towards Americans once I am incarcerated .
Improperly directed anger will be counter - productive to the cause .
If American rally support is significant , Canadians will see Americans as fellow warriors and victims in the drug war .
The risk is that there will be a lot of unproductive America - bashing by Canadians after my sentencing and while I am incarcerated .
Anger and indignation should be channeled against the drug war that exists everywhere on Earth , and towards the politicians that make these injustices and cruelties happen .
Find out why Marc is cutting a deal with US prosecutors .
Find out more about Marc ’s fight against extradition at NoExtradition .net .
HERE IS WHAT YOU CAN DO TO HELP !
1 ) Hold a rally in your town on Saturday , September 19th with hundreds of others around the world !
Go here for information !
2 ) Contact the Minister of Justice in Canada and insist he return Marc Emery to Canada as soon as possible !
Phone the Justice Minister at ( 613 ) 957-4222 , then send a letter to the Minister of Justice and Members of Parliament ( and let the Justice Minister know that Members of Parliament are also being contacted , so your concerns should not be ignored ! ) then forward a copy to Jodie Emery at [ email protected ]
3 ) Write a letter asking the Washington State judge to let Marc Emery return to Canada without any imprisonment .
If enough pieces of mail arrive at the courthouse , the judge will realize that many people are going to be upset if Marc Emery is sentenced to prison time , and he may be persuaded to give a lighter sentence — perhaps even the same as Marc ’s two coaccused Greg Williams and Michelle Rainey , who are starting two years of probation in Canada .
Send your polite , passionate letters to :
Honorable Ricardo S. Martinez
U.S. Courthouse
700 Stewart Street
Seattle , WA

Discover how to draw complex shadows , highlights , and even flames in Inskscape .
We 'll be using gradients , blurs , and clipping to simulate the effect of Illustrator 's gradient mesh in Inkscape .

Intermediate Estimated Completion Time : 1 hour
Step 1
Do a Google image search for " candle . "
We wo n't be tracing over a reference image , but you may want to study several photos .
There are a lot of subtleties to a candle 's lighting , and it's hard to create them from your imagination alone .
We 'll be using several layers , and it helps to give them descriptive names .
Rename the current layer to " Trunk . "
This will hold the body of the candle .
Using the Pen tool , draw the outline of the candle .
The top of the shape you draw will ultimately become the top -rear of the candle .
If you make the top wavy like I did , the candle will look like it 's been burning for awhile .
Note that the very top of the candle is wider than the base .
This gives the impression that the wax has melted and curled over a bit .
We 'll strengthen this effect later with highlighting .
I drew the bottom arc by hand , but if you want , you can use the Ellipse tool , then merge it with the rest of the shape .
To do that , select both the ellipse and the shape .
Then click Path > Union .
Step 2
Right - click the shape and select " Fill and Stroke . "
Select the Fill tab and click the linear gradient icon .
Click Edit and set up gradient stops with these four parameters : ( 1 ) Offset of 0.00 and Color of # c62f08 ff , ( 2 ) Offset of 0.30 and Color of # c03c08 ff , ( 3 ) Offset of 0.60 and Color of # bd4607 ff , and ( 4 ) Offset of 1.00 and Color of # df512 aff .
Step 3
Create a new layer on top of the current one and call it " Top . "
Using the Pen tool , draw an irregular elliptical shape .
This will be the top of the candle .
Step 4
Fill the shape with a radial gradient .
This creates a highlight in the center where the flame will eventually be .
The stops for this gradient are : ( 1 ) Offset of 0.00 and Color of # fffab0ff and ( 2 ) Offset of 1.00 and Color of # ffac19ff .
Step 5
Now we can start highlighting the candle .
This is the most important part , as almost all of the depth in the image comes from the highlights .
Create a new layer between the " Trunk " and " Top " layers , and call it " Trunk Highlights . "
Draw a simple box across the upper half of the candle .
Step 6
Fill the box with a radial gradient .
Unlike the others , this one will go from solid to transparent .
The stops are : ( 1 ) Offset of 0.00 and Color of # ffac29c3 , ( 2 ) Offset of 0.47 and Color of # ffa92247 , and ( 3 ) Offset of 1.00 and Color of # ffa21c00 .
Step 7
We can't let that highlight spill over the way it 's doing now , so we have to clip it within the bounds of the trunk .
To do that , select the trunk ( the first shape your created ) and copy it to the clipboard .
Choose Edit > Paste In Place .
Fill it bright green so it stands out .
Remove the top of the shape as illustrated below .
Handy Trick :
To get rid of Bezier handles , mouse over them and Control - click .
Step 8
Make sure the green trunk copy is above the highlight .
You can reorder objects with page - up and page - down .
Select the green trunk copy and the highlight .
Choose Object > Clip >
Set .
The highlight should now be clipped to the shape of the trunk .
Step 9
We 'll now add highlights to the sides of the trunk , simulating a studio lighting setup .
Draw two shapes like those shown below .
Step 10
Select the two shapes , go to Fill and Stroke , and set their Blur to 4.0 .
Step 11
Give them each a linear gradient going from white to transparent .
Clip them both to the shape of the trunk , following the same procedure as before .
Step 12
Now we 'll emphasize the lip around the top with some highlights .
At the top - front , draw a shape like that shown below ( green shape ) , just below the edge .
Step 13
Blur it .
Step 14
Apply a white to transparent radial gradient .
Step 15
Draw similar shapes at other points around the lip .
Step 16
Blur them and add radial gradients .
Step 17
These few sharp highlights are n't quite enough to suggest the shape of the lip .
So , we 'll add one subtle highlight going all the way around .
This shape will be a ring with a hole in the middle .
To achieve that , draw the outer ring , and then draw the inner ring on top of it .
Select both rings and choose Path > Difference .
Step 18
Set it to a semi- transparent white and Blur it .
This one does n't need a gradient .
Step 19
To suggest light coming from the flame , we 'll add a highlight on the inside of the lip .
Drawing the left and right sides of the shape requires a bit of three - dimensional thinking .
Step 20
Blur the inner highlight .
Thanks to our layering , the Blur does n't spill over onto the yellow ellipse .
Step 21
Apply a radial gradient going from orange - yellow to transparent .
Extend the gradient handles beyond the bounds of the object .
Step 22
We 're done with the highlights .
Here 's how it looks so far , shown below .
Step 23
Now we can start drawing the wick and flame .
First , draw an ellipse in the top- center , color it yellow - orange , and give it some Blur .
This will simulate the pool of molten wax around the wick .
Step 24
Draw the wick .
This should be a very simple shape , but make it a little more interesting than a rectangle .
Give it a black to yellow gradient .
Step 25
Let 's draw the flame .
Create a new layer called " Flame . "
Start by drawing a simple shape that shown below .
Fill it with a solid , fleshy color .
Step 26
Draw a slightly different shape on top of it , leaving a bit of a gap at the bottom .
Step 27
Fill the top shape with white and Blur it .
Step 28
Draw a boomerang - like shape at the bottom of the flame .
Step 29
Fill it with yellow and Blur it .
Step 30
Draw a circle at the bottom of the flame and Blur it .
Step 31
Apply a peach to transparent gradient , running top to bottom .
Step 32
The candle itself is done , but it looks rather bland against a white background .
Let 's draw a simple backdrop .
For mine , I just applied a vertical , linear gradient , then layered a radial gradient on top of it .
Final Image
With the background in place , our candle stands out nicely .
For added realism , you could put a few shadows on the ground beneath the candle .

Microsoft may be forced to release an out - of - cycle security update for a vulnerability published the same day as the firm released its September Patch Tuesday update .
Security researcher Laurent Gaffie published proof of concept code showing how a flaw in Microsoft 's file sharing ( SMB2 ) protocol could be exploited .
The flaw means that an attacker can remotely crash any Windows Vista or Windows 7 machines with Server Message Block 2.0 ( SMB2 ) enabled , he said .
According to Gaffie , Windows XP and 2000 are not affected by the flaw as they do not use SMB2 .
" This issue does appear to be remotely exploitable , and companies should look to patch as a matter of urgency as it presents a very real danger , " said Roger Rawlinson , managing director assurance at NCC Group .
" Threats from an external perspective will be limited as long as best practice has been followed in regards to blocking access to netbios at the external firewalls , " he said .
" We expect Microsoft to monitor the extent of exploitation of this new vulnerability and to provide guidance for workaround , " said Wolfgang Kandek , chief technology officer at security firm Qualys .
Microsoft is also working on a security update for a flaw in its Internet Information Service ( IIS ) software , which was disclosed last week .
" Until a patch for this is issued , as a temporary workaround we suggest IT administrators using IIS 5.0 and 6.0 turn off anonymous write access immediately , " said Ben Greenbaum , senior research manager at Symantec Security Response .
Those using IIS 7.0 with FTP Service version 6.0 installed should upgrade to FTP Service version 7.5 , said Greenbaum .
The existence of two zero - day vulnerabilities has sparked speculation that Microsoft will release an out - of - band patch before its scheduled October security update .
Yesterday , Microsoft issued five security bulletins which address eight vulnerabilities , six of which are rated as critical .
The focus is on the Windows operating system family and most versions are affected .
" The notable exception is Windows 7 , which is a pleasant surprise and most likely an outcome of the additional security measure implemented in this latest version of Windows , " said Kandek .
MS09-045 and MS09-047 are client - side vulnerabilities affecting indirectly Internet Explorer and Windows Media Player .
MS09 -048 is a network vulnerability located in the TCP / IP network stack of Windows 2008 and Vista and can be exploited through the network .
MS09-049 is an attack on the WLan auto - configuration service of Vista and Windows 2008 .
" This requires a malicious access point to be in Wi-Fi range , which limits the number of machines that can be attacked at any given time , " said Kandek .
Germany - based Heise Security has confirmed the flaw 's effect on Vista , but said it had no apparent effect on a computer running Windows 7 .

The paper
As you can see there is a great deal of variance in white male life expectancy in the United Sates .
Compare to this map :
" American " is probably just Scotch - Irish in this case .
It is noticeable it seems on this map that the countries in central Texas where Anglo ancestry is dominated by those of German origin exhibit high life expectancy .
In any case , you can actually look at the county - by - county data set from the above paper in regards to life expectancies .
The minimum male life expectancy in any county is 62 , with the maximum being 80.30 .
The median is 73.60 and the mean 73.38 ( these data are ~2000 ) .
There 's a " long tail " of sparsely populated counties with low male life expectancies as evidenced by the lower mean value than the median .
The standard deviation across the counties is 2.35 years .
As can be seen on the first map there is a strong geographic component to the interregional differences .
Below is a chart which reports the proportion of counties in the 50 states which have a life expectancy at , or above , the Canadian national value as of the year 2000 ( again , both these values are for males ) .
Some states obviously have very few counties .
But Kentucky has 120 .
None of them are at the Canadian level .

CHILDREN suffering from potentially lethal nut allergies have been offered the hope of leading normal lives for the first time , following the success of an experimental treatment .
Doctors at Addenbrooke 's Hospital in Cambridge have developed a pioneering therapy that effectively " retrains " the immune systems of patients who have food allergies so that they become desensitised to the food .
Trials of the technique have so far helped 20 children with severe peanut allergies overcome their condition .
Before the treatment , many of the patients could not touch even trace amounts of peanuts without suffering a reaction , but the researchers claim that the youngsters can now safely eat up to 12 peanuts a day without them having any effect .
The researchers are planning larger trials of the treatment to test its effectiveness and also hope to develop the therapy to treat other dangerous allergies to foods such as milk , eggs and gluten .
They believe the treatment could become a routine way of combating allergies .
69 Dollar Bid On The Price Is Right
Elizabeth Pennisi writes in Science about a case where computer scientists and their lawyers are bumbling through biology :
Patent 20090030925 was filed by Microsoft researcher Stuart Ozer , an expert in databases , in July 2007 .
Ozer says he wanted to apply database technologies to complex problems in biological sciences : " I saw an opportunity to create a new approach in analyzing sequence data when phylogenetic information was available , " he says .
The patent application describes a way to use biological data that has been organized according to evolutionary relatedness .
It includes methods for counting evolutionary events and grouping positions within molecules .
However , " this patent is written in such broad language that it appears to swallow up any activity that involves understanding biodiversity through phylogenetics , " says William Piel , a phylogeneticist at Yale University .
He points out that such analyses date back to Charles Darwin , who sketched the first evolutionary tree ; today , more than 350 phylogeny software packages are available on the Web .
" Microsoft might as well patent the multiplication tables , " Piel says .
The only novelty in this case is that systematists are likely to take it personally .
Biomedical researchers already work in a patent - rich environment , museum researchers in taxonomy do not – at least , not yet .
But with genomics and bioinformatics , the field is ripe for colonization by enterprising software developers whose companies ’ lawyers will be looking to protect their time .
And let ’s not forget that universities have been stomping into the patent game .
Seems to me that somebody needs to fund a few systematists to outline prior art in the area , so that the field is protected from overly broad patents that might stifle the development of new research methods .
Maybe there ’s a bright side :
There ’s no way that Microsoft could develop anything worse than the ICZN .

I wanted to share an interesting , yet common story about attracting women .
I am sure many times in your life you have been walking down the street and saw a beautiful women with an unattractive man and said to yourself “ something is wrong here .
Why is she with that guy ? ” I am sure you could not understand it .
That is because you could not see what women see and that is energy .
The energy that has been attracting women for centuries .
This is the confident , self assured and comfortable energy I have been describing to you since day one .
Unlike men , women are not primarily driven by looks .
Looks can be overridden by personality to a point where a man ’s features can totally transform in the eyes of a woman .
I recently sat down my friend and former Playboy model and we got into a conversation about looks vs. personality .
She shared an interesting story with me so I asked her to jot it down so I could share with you .
This story is about meeting the not so expected love of her life .
This story will tell you if when attracting women , if looks matter .
*******
Attracting Women : Do Looks Matter ?
Looks , I thought used to be very important to me until the man who made that seem last on my list .
I remember it was a late winter evening .
I was running behind and had gotten lost on my way to a first date .
By the time I finally got there my stomach starting feeling like it was eating my spinal chord and I had just assumed we would stay at the restaurant where we met .
But , he had changed his mind and wanted to go up the block to a little place he ’d heard of .
My date , ( a good - looking , late 30’s , Real Estate Broker ) and I arrived at this great little Italian restaurant about twenty minutes to closing .
The Gentleman , ( an overweight , mid 30’s , Matier ’d ) who greeted us said they would love to have us stay and enjoy a meal , ( even though it was completely apparent no one else was in the restaurant ) .
We could n’t resist !
I noticed there was something unusually appealing about the Matier’d .
He politely sat us and motioned over to the server .
“ Bon Appetit ” , he said as he handed me a menu .
My date and I shared some opinions over the real estate market and the neighborhood we were in while sipping our Chianti and devouring the Muscles Marinara we had ordered just to start .
By the time the entrees arrived , ( Zuppa de Pesce with the freshest Burrata I ’d ever tasted for me and Pappardelle with braised Veal Bolognese for him ) I came to the conclusion that my first date was going pretty well .
And , I had n’t cared less !
Although he was good - looking and successful , I could n’t stop looking over at the man who sat us trying to figure out what it was about him .
He had a tall build , dark intense eyes , and he was overweight !
But , his mannerisms were extremely confident and there was an air about him .
Overall , still NOT the guy that catches my eye .
Especially , when I had the attention of a beautiful man sitting right in front of me .
So strange , when I look back on that night .
I ’ve never been that drawn to someone so instantaneously .
When the server came to ask us for dessert I had already decided that I wanted to find my own way home so I could share at least a few words with this man I found to be so unusually appealing .
Dessert seemed to have went by like an eternity and the double shot of espresso made me even more anxious for dinner to be over and for me to act on my curiosity .
Finally , dinner came to a close and my date politely said good night out front when I told him I was going in the opposite direction .
He kissed my cheek and waved as his cab turned the corner .
After standing out front for a few moments , willing my new crush to come outside before the next taxi pulled up .
I heard a man ’s voice ask if I was , “ all set ” .
I turned to him and said , “ Yeah .
Just waiting for a cab . ”
He nodded politely and stepped outside with me .
He began asking me the normal questions you do when you first meet someone , “ What ’s your name ? , Where are you from ? ,
What do you do for work ? , yada yada yada ” but it was n’t what he was asking me , it was how he asked it .
He did n’t turn his eyes away from me once while I was speaking .
I felt his eyes going over every part of my face as I spoke to him and answered each question like it was the first time I ’d ever been asked this information by anyone !
I could feel him studying my lips as the words came out of my mouth , my hair as I pushed it away from my face , and my eyes when I actually worked up the nerve to look into his .
He made me feel shy and sexy at the same time .
Something I never felt before .
And when he directed his attention towards me it was fully and honestly .
He had a confidence about him that I never saw in any other man .
His confidence came from knowing what he wanted without being afraid of it .
After a few polite exchanges , he asked me if I had n’t liked the tiramisu my date ordered for us , ( I assumed he noticed how anxious I was ) .
I replied with what I hoped would catch his attention instead of the truth , ( which was that I could n’t be bothered with anything else besides him at the time ) .
So , I said in the most sultry voice I could , “ I do n’t feel like tiramisu tonight . ”
He turned to me with surprise , looked at me as if I had said something wrong , and as I turned away not knowing if I had just made a fool of myself , I secretly wished he would ask me to explain why I was n’t in the mood for tiramisu over some coffee together .
And like an attentive man should , he noticed , turned back to me , looked me dead in the eye , and said what I expected least , “ Do you like puff pastries ? ”
That was him .
Corny , but funny .
Charismatic and strong .
It did n’t take long for me to fall in love with him .
I always used to wonder how woman found certain men attractive , but I think some men really understand that a good woman just wants to be with a man we feel special with .
A man that makes us laugh .
We dated for a little over a year and I choose to see him as the man who showed me that being so superficial for the rest of your life is such a bore !
Grazie .
And yes , you ’re right .
This is L.A .
And it is hard to find someone that has more than just looks to offer .
But , on the most exclusive lists in “ Tinsel Town ” , looks are last in line and it ’s all about the swagg , Gentleman !
Work it .

Artificial trees could be used in areas where carbon emissions are high Engineers say a forest of 100,000 " artificial trees " could be deployed within 10 to 20 years to help soak up the world 's carbon emissions .
The trees are among three geo-engineering ideas highlighted as practical in a new report .
The authors from the Institution of Mechanical Engineers say that without geo-engineering it will be impossible to avoid dangerous climate change .
The report includes a 100 - year roadmap to " decarbonise " the global economy .
No silver bullet Launching the report , lead author Dr Tim Fox said geo-engineering should not be viewed as a " silver bullet " that could combat climate change in isolation .
He told BBC News it should be used in conjunction with efforts to reduce carbon emissions and to adapt to the effects of climate change .
Many climate scientists calculate that the world has only a few decades to reduce emissions before there is so much carbon dioxide in the atmosphere that a dangerous rise in global temperature is inevitable .

The authors of this report say that geo-engineering of the type they propose should be used on a short - term basis to buy the world time , but in the long term it is vital to reduce emissions .
They define two types of geo-engineering .
Nem Vaughan of University of East Anglia said : " The first category attempts to cool the planet by reflecting some of the sunlight away .
The problem with this is that it just masks the problem . "
" The other type of geo - engineering is to remove carbon dioxide from the atmosphere and store it . "
Hundreds of options
The team studied hundreds of different options but have put forward just three as being practical and feasible using current technology .
A key factor in choosing the three was that they should be low - carbon technologies rather than adding to the problem .
Dr Fox told BBC
News : " Artificial trees are already at the prototype stage and are very advanced in their design in terms of their automation and in the components that would be used .
" They could , within a relatively short duration , be moved forward into mass production and deployment . "
The trees would work on the principle of capturing carbon dioxide from the air through a filter .
The CO2 would then be removed from the filter and stored .
The report calls for the technology to be developed in conjunction with carbon storage infrastructure .
The captured carbon dioxide could be stored in empty north sea oil wells Dr Fox said the prototype artificial tree was about the same size as a shipping container and could remove thousands of times more carbon dioxide from the atmosphere than an equivalent sized real tree .
Another of the team 's preferred methods of capturing carbon is to install what they term " algae based photobioreactors " on buildings .
These would be transparent containers containing algae which would remove carbon dioxide from the air during photosynthesis .
Algae units could be designed into new buildings or retrofitted to old ones
The third option focuses on the reduction of incoming solar radiation by reflecting sunlight back into space .
The report says the simplest way of doing this is for buildings to have reflective roofs .
The authors stress that all of these options will require more research and have called for the UK government to invest 10 million pounds in analysis of the effectiveness , risks and costs of geo-engineering .
Dr Fox said : " We very much believe that the practical geo- engineering that we are proposing should be implemented and could be very much part of our landscape within the next 10 to 20 years . "

India And Vastu - A Brief History
Vastu shastra , the ancient architectural science , was first mentioned in the Indian holy texts called The Vedas .
More specifically , it was mentioned in the Stapatya Veda , which is a part of the Atharva Veda .
The Vedas are more than five thousand years old .
The sages in those times plotted the course of the sun and set down rules that governed each and every aspect of building temples and royal palaces .
It was only later that these rules grew to encompass buildings of every kind .
The word vastu is derived from the word vastoshpati which is found in the Rig Veda .
This concept is aimed at the preserving the happiness , health and prosperity of human beings in this life and the afterlife .
Vastu also believes in the existence of the Vastu Purush , the god who resides in all buildings .
The main function of vastu is to maintain the balance that we have with everything around us .
The science of vastu spread to other parts of Asia , including Japan where it became the basis for the development of Feng Shui .
In India , proof of the existence of vastu can be found in many sacred texts and epics .
The Ramayana and Mahabharata mention buildings that were constructed according to vastu principles .
Vastu was also used for the buildings in the Indus Valley Civilization .
Excavations at Harappa and Mohenjadaro are proof of this .
The first official thesis on Vastu was written by the sage Kasyapa .
It was called the Kasyapa Silpa .
A dissertation called the Agama Shastra talks about how vastu can be used for any type of construction .
Vastu shastra , being a technical science , was initially taught only to architects .
The architects passed the knowledge through the generations verbally and by written monographs .
Ancient Buddhist texts also mention vastu .
In fact , Lord Buddha talks about how overseeing the work on the construction of a building is one of the duties of a monk .
Monasteries , multi storey buildings , workplaces and residences were built using vastu principles .
Apart from the solar movements , vastu also places importance on the eight directions and the five basic elements .
The directions are north , south , east , west , north - west , north - east , south - west and south - east .
The elements are earth , wind , fire , water and sky .
Vastu believes that if there is a balance between all these elements , then we will have a happy and prosperous life .
The balance in our outer surroundings will bring balance to our inner selves .
The theories of vastu have also been scientifically proven .
We know now that the earth 's magnetic poles have an influence on us .
We also know that there is something called the Natural Law which is responsible for all life in the universe .
Vastu complies with all these theories .
It ensures that our houses and offices are built in such a way that we make the best of all the positive energies present around us and reduces our exposure to negative energies .
Even in cyberspace , the moment can only be described as surreal .
Two thousand Apple computer loyalists greet the return of their hero and Apple co-founder , Steven Jobs , at a Boston trade show , only to gasp as the looming picture of Apple 's archenemy , Bill Gates of Microsoft , appears on a huge on - stage screen .
It was Mr. Gates , after all , who copied Apple 's visionary point - and - click system of computer commands , marketed it far more aggressively and successfully , and drove Apple to near - collapse .
Mr. Gates and Mr. Jobs announced that Microsoft would inject more than $ 150 million into Apple and take other steps to guarantee Apple 's near - term survival .
Some Apple zealots in the audience hooted .
Others sighed in relief .
Virtually all were surprised and confused .
Even in cyberspace it is odd for one company to bail out its only rival in a key area of business .
Between them , Microsoft and Apple sell the operating systems , which dictate how computers analyze and display information , that run virtually every personal computer .
Odd or not , the bailout is good for both .
Apple users are assured that their beloved company gets desperately needed cash and that Microsoft will continue to supply them up - to - date word processing and other applications software .
Many would - be Apple buyers had been turning away out of fear that as Apple 's market share shriveled , so would the programs made available for use on Apple machines .
The bailout is also good for Microsoft because it preserves a demand for its software programs designed to be compatible with Apple machines .
But some suspect a more Machiavellian purpose by Microsoft as well .
Microsoft can now fend off antitrust charges by pointing out that Apple 's continued existence will prevent Microsoft from acting as a monopolist .
If Apple dies , Microsoft will appear nakedly monopolistic , the only major producer of operating systems for personal computers .
Of all the dismal and discouraging numbers to have emerged from the world of newspapers — the sharp plunges in circulation , the dizzying fall - off in revenues , the burgeoning debt , the mounting losses — none seems as sobering as the relentless march of layoffs and buyouts .
According to the blog Paper Cuts , newspapers lost 15,974 jobs in 2008 and another 10,000 in the first half of 2009 .
That ’s 26,000 fewer reporters , editors , photographers , and columnists to cover the world , analyze political and economic affairs , root out corruption and abuse , and write about culture , entertainment , and sports .
The membership of the Military Reporters and Editors Association has fallen from six hundred in 2001 to under one hundred today .
In April , Cox Newspapers closed its Washington office , contributing to the dramatic decline in the number of reporters covering the federal government .
The Boston Globe , The Baltimore Sun , The Philadelphia Inquirer , and Newsday have all closed their foreign bureaus .
Because of repeated retrenchments , the McClatchy newspapers , which include The Sacramento Bee , The Charlotte Observer , and more than two dozen other dailies across the US , cannot afford to open a South Asia bureau that ’s been in the works for three years , or to keep a full - time correspondent in Mexico or even Baghdad , where its bureau has done such standout work .
In “ the good old days , ” McClatchy editor Mark Seibel recently wrote , the organization could lay off reporters “ and insist with a straight face that there would be no change in our ability to cover the news .
No more .
The last year of layoffs , cutbacks and consolidations have hurt .
Bad . ”
In an online chat with readers earlier this year , New York Times executive editor Bill Keller deplored the “ diminishing supply of quality journalism ” at a time of “ growing demand . ”
By quality journalism , he said , he meant the kind “ that involves experienced reporters going places , bearing witness , digging into records , developing sources , checking and double - checking , backed by editors who try to enforce high standards . ”
The supply of such journalism , he added ,
is declining because it is hard , expensive , sometimes dangerous work .
The traditional practitioners of this craft — mainly newspapers — have been downsizing or declaring bankruptcy .
The wonderful florescence of communication ignited by the Internet contains countless voices riffing on the journalism of others but not so many that do serious reporting of their own .
Keller ’s lament — one of a steady chorus rising from the industry — contains a feature common to many of them : a put - down of the Web and the bloggers who regularly comment on Web sites .
David Simon , a former Baltimore Sun reporter and the creator of The Wire , offered a particularly barbed version during recent testimony in the Senate on the future of journalism .
While the Internet is “ a marvelous tool , ” he declared , it
leeches … reporting from mainstream news publications , whereupon aggregating websites and bloggers contribute little …
AUSTIN , Texas —
In general , I ’m against kicking ’em when they ’re down … unless really awful people are involved .
I figured Tom DeLay is so awful , plenty of people would gang up on him and I could pass .
Imagine my surprise when the toughest question one famous TV tough guy could come up with was , “ Do you think you invested too much in the Republican Party ? ”
Another inquired whether DeLay could think of any mistakes he ’d made .
I waited with bated breath for the immortal , “ I wish I could learn not to work so hard , ” but no , he could n’t think of a single one .
Newt Gingrich and Tom DeLay first came to power promising to restore democracy to the House of Representatives , supposedly suffering from then - Speaker Jim Wright ’s tyrannical regime .
Even after the Rs drove Wright from office , however , bipartisanship was out of the question for DeLay .
In the budget fight and government shutdown of 1995 , for instance , DeLay rejected compromise and famously said , “ It ’s time for all - out war . ”
I never minded DeLay being a tough guy — it was his syrupy claims to carry the banner for Christianity that I found offensive , as he frog - marched the House toward being a cash - operated special - interest machine .
The idea of putting pressure on lobbyists to give only to Republicans , pressuring lobbying firms into hiring only Republicans and then letting lobbyists sit at the table during committee meetings where legislation was written — it was just screaming overt corruption .
Tom DeLay and Newt Gingrich turned the U.S. House of Representatives , “ the people ’s House , ” into a pay - for - play machine for corporations .
Put in enough money , get your special tax exemption , get your earmarked government contract , get your trade legislation and your environmental exemption , get rid of safety regulation .
I ’d like to address the idea that what DeLay did was only “ payback ” for the alleged sins of Jim Wright and then - House Majority Whip Tony Coelho , that it ’s “ our turn ” at the trough , so why not act like Dan Rostenkowski ?
It ’s a great way to rationalize misbehavior , even if the misbehavior is as disproportionate as Wright ’s ethical peccadillo compared to the open corruption of DeLay ’s “ K Street Project , ” selling Congress to the lobby .
I ’ve watched enough switches of political power and use of the “ payback ” excuse to realize that what the new Ins call “ payback ” has little to do with whatever the new Outs used to do .
It is , instead , a direct reflection — “ projection , ” the shrinks call it — of the ethical values of the Ins onto the Outs .
Every time you hear a misdeed justified by , “ Well , they used to do it , ” you can generally mark off a 50 % to 75 % exaggeration .
To get a real sense of DeLay ’s cynicism and recklessness , forget the stuff the press loves , like the “ free golfing trip ” to St. Andrew’s .
Instead , take note of the following example .
The Northern Marianas Islands are a U.S. protectorate ( so it can label goods “ Made in the USA ” ) being used as a sort of labor gulag in the Pacific , with workers imported from China and elsewhere and paid pitiful wages .
Jack Abramoff had a contract with the government of the Marianas to lobby against stopping the flow of immigrant labor to the islands and to prevent a minimum wage bill ( mandating a level higher than the island ’s standard $ 3.05 per hour ) from getting to the floor of the House .
The islands are home to classic sweatshops .
In 1996 and 1997 , Abramoff billed the Marianas for 187 contacts with DeLay ’s office , including 16 meetings with DeLay .
In December 1997 , DeLay , his wife and their daughter went on an Abramoff - arranged jaunt to the Marianas .
DeLay brunched with the Marianas ’ largest private employer , textile magnate Willie Tan .
Tan had to settle a U.S. Labor Department lawsuit alleging workplace violations .
According to the book “ The Hammer ” by Lou Dubose and Jan Reid , among the violations common on the islands is forbidding women to work when they are pregnant , thus leading to a high abortion rate .
Evidently , DeLay did n’t have time to look into such allegations , since he was busy playing golf and attending a dinner in his honor , sponsored by Tan ’s holding company .
According to The Washington Post , it was at this dinner that DeLay called Abramoff “ one of my closest and dearest friends . ”
He also reminded those present of his promise that no minimum wage or immigration legislation affecting the Marianas would be passed .
“ Stand firm , ” he added .
“ Resist evil .
Remember that all truth and blessings emanate from our Creator . ”
He then went with Tan to see a cockfight .
This is why DeLay ’s professions of Christianity make me sick .
He was there .
He could have talked to the workers .
Instead , he chose to walk with the powerful and do real harm to the very people Jesus mandated we especially care for .
