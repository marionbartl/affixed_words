The Honey House
KAKI HUNTER and DONI KIFFMEYER
After a hands - on workshop taught by architect Nader Khalili , we returned home inspired to build our first earthbag project .
We started with simple , linear , buttressed exterior walls , graduated to serpentine garden walls , progressed to a small dome and are now finishing a larger dome with a vaulted entry way and big sunny arched windows .
This last project turned into a casual workshop inviting people to learn " Flexible Form Rammed Earth , " A term we now use that we feel best describes this construction method .
" Flexible Form Rammed Earth ( F.F.R.E. ) " is a free - form version of rammed earth construction .
Since the bags act as a flexible form , it allows the architectural design of curvaceous , sensual structures .
We have the ability to mold , bend , writhe and swoop sculptural forms inspired by nature 's artistic freedom , while providing structural integrity .
Hence , a whole house from foundation to walls to roof can be built using the " Flexible Form Rammed Earth " technique .
Our personal education began when we adopted the FQSS stamp of approval 
Fun , Quick , Simple and Solid !
By following this criteria , we made the ease of the construction process our priority .
As long as the work was Fun and Simple , it went Quickly and the results were Solid .
When the work became in any way awkward , FQSS deteriorated into Frustrating , Quarrelsome , Slow and Stupid , prompting us to stop , change tactics or blow the whole thing off and have lunch .
( Returning refreshed often spontaneously resolved the problem , resuming FQSS approval . )
THE BASIC PROCEDURE is simple .
The bags or tubes are filled with a suitable pre-moistened dirt right on the foundation , laid in a mason - style " running bond . "
We use # 10 coffee cans for scooping and filling .
This eliminates any heavy lifting .
After a row of bags has been laid , the row is compacted with hand tampers .
We lay two strands of long - barbed 4 - point barbed wire between every course which acts as a " Velcro mortar " cinching the bags in place .
This also provides tensile strength while allowing for the rows to be stepped in to create self - supporting corbelled domes [ there is realistic concern about saturation and collapse of unstabilized materials in wet climates ed ] and other unusual shapes .
Round structures are guided by the use of a revolving compass .
Arched openings are incorporated with the use of removable plywood forms until the " keystone " bags are tamped into place .
An average of four people working 5 - 6 hours per day moved 40 tons of earth with coffee cans to complete the " bag work " of the Honey House , a 16 - ft corbelled dome , in 19 days .
In another 7 days , we moved 7 tons more in the form of cob onto the roof .
The material we used in our bags is called " reject sand , " obtainable from most gravel yards .
Reject sand is the by - product of the process that separates sand and " clay fines " from the gravel being produced at these facilities .
This reject material often has the best ratio of clay to sand ( approximately 25 % clay to 75 % sand ) for rammed earth construction .
And ... it is dirt cheap !
We paid $ 1.00 per ton plus delivery .
The bags we used for our construction are woven polypropylene " misprints . "
The companies that manufacture these bags sometimes have imperfections or mistakes in the printing process that render them unsuitable to their clients .
Rather than throw these bags away , the manufacturers will sell them at a reduced cost .
A comprehensive list of bag manufacturers can be found in the Thomas Register at your local library .
Our favorite manufacturer has been Cady Industries in East Memphis , TN .
Exterior and interior finishes of these structures are open to many options suitable to the climate and design of the building .
Wall plasters range from a variety of natural adobe to stabilized earth to lime / cement stucco .
Since a corbelled F.F.R.E. roof is exceptionally strong they can easily be bermed into a hillside , or carry the weight of a 9 - inch - thick living roof , or a hefty layer of sculpted adobe .
Terra cotta tiles , mortared slab stone or slate shingles as well as wood or asphalt shingles are also suitable roofing materials .
In warm , frost - free climates , lime / cement stucco can be appropriate .
Thermal performance of earthen structures offer a level of comfort expressed by a long history of world - wide experience .
50 % of the current world population live in earthen dwellings from climates as diverse as China , Australia , Africa , Europe , and throughout the US .
Dense materials such as adobe , and rammed earth have R- values roughly equivalent to 0.25 per inch ... yet despite this low R- value , earthen walls function as an absorbent mass that is able to store warmth and return it to the living spaces as it is needed .
This has been documented as the thermal flywheel effect and is referred to as the K - value .
This substantiates the common experience people feel that an adobe house is " warm in the winter and cool in the summer . "
[ The " effective R- value " discussion depends enormously on climate and the thickness of the mass .
ed . ]
The merits of " Flexible Form Rammed Earth " are in its use of cost - effective materials , simple construction methods and the durable resistance to the ravages of fires , hurricanes , flooding , termites and , as Nader Khalili has proven in Southern California , earthquakes .
This makes this type of architecture capable of surviving as long as its 500 - 1000 year old rammed earth relatives around the world .
Costs for do - it - ourselves construction of the Honey House before windows and doors :
Home made tools ( compass , stands , pounders , etc. ) $ 175 Plywood arch forms ( reusable ) $ 150 Chicken wire $ 120 Professional backhoe excavation
( 2ft. deep x 16 ft. diam . )
$ 150 Straw for plaster / cob ( 20 bales ) $ 135 4 - point barbed wire ( 2 rolls ) $ 190 40 tons reject sand ( delivered ) $ 150 1000 bags ( delivered ) $ 250 TOTAL $ 920
* Tools of the the " dirt bag " trade .
To comply with the FQSS theory , we adopted techniques and developed a few specialized tools that enhanced the precision and quality of the construction , Equipped with the latest tools of the " dirt bag trade " a new jargon of bag talk has been born : bag stands , sliders , diddling , tube chutes , full pounders , quarter pounders , sliding compass , fans , halos , chicken - wire cradles , can tossing , contouring , hard - ass bags , and a huge breakthrough in bag technology , " scooching . "
These simple additions to the repertoire of FFRE construction have turned an awesome job into a friendly task .
We are currently involved in documenting material for a " How to " manual and inspirational video on F.F.R.E construction ( go ahead , pronounce it free construction ! ) .
We offer workshops in design and hands - on construction techniques utilizing Flexible Form Rammed Earth architecture as an aid to creating affordable and earth - friendly housing .

We ’ve already scratched thrift , candor and brevity off the list of virtues in this presidential cycle , so why not eliminate humor too ?
That seems to be the fondest wish of a few commentators and legions of Internet blatherers , who spent much of Monday vilifying New Yorker magazine for this week ’s cover , which depicts Barack and Michelle Obama as a couple of gun-toting , flag - burning , America - hating terrorists .
It seemed fairly obvious to me , my 8 - year - old and , likely , the majority of readers of one of America ’s finest magazines that the cover drawing by Barry Blitt was a parody .
In other words ( for those still struggling with the concept ) , the joke was not on the Obamas but on the knuckle - walkers who would do them harm by trying to turn a couple of fresh - scrubbed Harvard Law grads into something foreign and scary .
Yet online discussion boards from coast to coast overflowed with anger and despair that the image of the golden young senator from Illinois had somehow been taken in vain .

A grass -roots organizer in Chicago named Mark S. Allen made his complaint to one of the Chicago Tribune ’s blogs .
“ I will NEVER purchase or read The New Yorker Magazine again !! ” mewled Allen .
“ I found your current cover on the Obamas extremely insulting , hurtful , racist and not worthy of the reward of my continuing to purchase The New Yorker . ”
That was mild compared to the shame that Chuck - in - Wichita heaped on the New Yorker via his comment to the Los Angeles Times ’ politics blog , Top of the Ticket .
Chuck failed “ to see the humor in that rag they call a magazine . ”
Not content to merely boycott the magazine , he pledged “ to never even visit New York , let alone live there . ”
But it was not only the general public that fumed .
Los Angeles City Councilman Bernard Parks , running for L.A. County supervisor , woofed on cable TV about the outrage of it all .

Chicago Tribune columnist / blogger Eric
Zorn gave notice that he is waiting for the magazine to launch an equal - ink takedown depicting John McCain as “ about 150 years old and spouting demented non-sequiturs in the middle of a violent temper tantrum while , in the corner , his wife is passed out next to a bottle of pills . ”
Actually , someone who has maintained a little more perspective already obliged .
David Horsey , the two - time Pulitzer Prize - winning cartoonist for the Seattle Post - Intelligencer , riffed on the Blitt illustration with a McCain portrait of his own .
Horsey ’s image shows a drooling , wheelchair - bound McCain , singing “ Bomb bomb bomb -- bomb bomb Iran , ” as wife Cindy pours dozens of pills from a vial and implores her husband , “ Take some of my meds to get through the inaugural parade ! ”
Playing off the New Yorker cartoon , in which an Osama bin Laden portrait adorns the Oval Office , an American flag aflame in the fireplace , Horsey poses the McCains in front of a Dick Cheney portrait , their fire burning a copy of the Constitution .

Lest anyone miss the point , the cartoonist dedicates the piece to all those “ irony - challenged literalists who were upset by the New Yorker ’s Obama - as - a- Muslim magazine cover . ”
That ’s coming from a self - described progressive who has put a world of hurt on President Bush but who said in an interview that he sees a disturbing “ lack of irony or sense of humor ” among some Obama supporters .
Jon Stewart regularly rides roughshod over candidates of both parties but hears nary a whimper .
That ’s as it should be .
The “ Daily Show ” host is , after all , lampooning a system overflowing with absurdity and irony .
Audiences understand those broadsides as satire but fret like kindergarten teachers when it comes to one image on a printed page .
“ It ’s like they need a flashing light saying , ‘ It ’s a joke , ’ or they lose the capacity to judge , ” Horsey said .
Advertisement
And speaking of judgment , how is it that Obamites , who are justifiably furious over threats to civil liberties under the current administration , suddenly want to play censor when the 1st Amendment puts their man even remotely on the hot seat ?
If Barry Blitt is anything , it ’s brilliantly provocative .
The New Yorker artist sent up the furor over gays in the military by playing off a famous end - of - World - War - II photo : Instead of a sailor and a pretty girl in amorous embrace , he drew two male sailors doubled over in a lip - lock .
A few years back , Blitt spoofed the idea of President Bush as a maid -- complete with apron and feather duster -- to the shadow president , a scowling , cigar - smoking Cheney .
In March , no one seemed to mind when Blitt had Hillary Rodham Clinton and Obama in the same bed ( maybe there is progress ? ) , both in their pajamas and lunging to be the one to answer that proverbial 3 a.m. phone call on some global crisis .
Advertisement
Obama ’s supporters are desperately afraid , and not without cause , that his image and record will be distorted .
The Huffington Post ’s Rachel Sklar took the New Yorker to task for providing an image that plays into all the reactionary stereotypes of “ anyone who ’s tried to paint Obama as a Muslim , anyone who ’s tried to portray Michelle as angry or a secret revolutionary out to get Whitey , anyone who has questioned their patriotism . ”
But those who are going to fantasize about the Obamas as jihadists or un-American wo n’t rely on a simple drawing .
They ’ll recycle old pictures of the senator in African robes , or rely on some creative YouTube splicing .
The Obama campaign felt it had to reject the New Yorker cartoon as “ tasteless and offensive . ”
The McCain camp quickly reached the same verdict .
Advertisement
Obama was the one man capable of putting the “ furor ” in its proper context .
But he did n’t .
Instead of his terse no comment , he should have played one of his strongest cards -- his cool -- responding something like : “ Hey , I thought Michelle looked pretty good in camouflage . ”

When in Rome , right ?
Despite the fact that he supported a moratorium on offshore drilling during his previous run for the White House and he has opposed drilling in Florida , North Carolina , Oregon and elsewhere , McCain will call for the elimination of that moratorium today in Houston .
McCain ’s prepared remarks will be be well - received in Houston , arguably the oil capital of America .
My point is this :
When McCain is in Portland , Oregon he speaks at a Vestas Wind Energy facility and touts the benefits of renewable energy ( but offers little policy support to back it up ) ; when McCain is in Houston he calls for a gas tax holiday and lifting the moratorium on offshore drilling .
In short , the part of me that hears Sen.
McCain speak about addressing climate change and developing “ alternate energy sources ” does n’t jive with the part of me that reads his voting record on this stuff .
And apparently , I ’m not the only one .
“ The easiest point to make about John McCain ’s current support for offshore drilling is that it is a flip - flop .
When McCain ran for president in 1999 , he supported the current moratorium on offshore drilling , slated to last until 2012 . ” ( Mother Jones )
“ McCain ’s reversal on off - shore drilling is a blatant pitch for donations at today ’s Houston fundraising events . ” ( David Donnely of Campaign Money Watch )
“ Although McCain says that he supports renewable energy , he has set so specific targets .
John McCain ’s website makes no mention of solar , wind , renewable energy , or even public transportation under the section on climate change and has no section on energy . ”
( Sarah Lozanova of Red , Green , & Blue )
Considering the mission of this blog , I would be remiss to not include a snippet from a conservative pundit and backer of the McCain plan ( especially considering how much time I spent trying to find one ! ) :
“ In fact , the economic slowdown , including the spike in gasoline prices , gives Republicans chance to attack Democrats as elitists , as “ let - them - drive - bicycles ” - type snobs ; as polar - bear loving Greens who would rather worry about glaciers on the North Pole than about jobs for Middle Americans in North Carolina or North Dakota . ” ( James Pinkerton of The Fox Forum )

( NaturalNews ) British Prime Minister Gordon Brown has announced his support for the harvesting of organs from dead patients without prior consent , and said that he hopes for such a policy change to take place within the year .
" A system of this kind seems to have the potential to close the aching gap between the potential benefits of transplant surgery in the United Kingdom and the limits imposed by our current system of consent , " Brown wrote in the With a waiting list for organs 8,000 patients long , and 1,000 people dying each year due to organ unavailability , the U.K. has announced plans to overhaul its organ donation system .
As part of this new effort , doctors and nurses will be pressured to identify more organ donors ahead of time and to alert organ donation coordinators as patients approach death .
The government seeks to appoint a doctor in each hospital as a donation " champion , " to be paired with a lay person who can do outreach on the topic .
The government admits that a conflict of interest might occur when doctors are encouraged to view still - living patients as potential organ sources .
Even with these planned measures , the government says that donations might still be insufficient .
For this reason , Brown and others are calling for the presumption of consent unless patients have formerly opted out or their family members explicitly deny permission .
Advocates point to the discrepancy between the rate at which people in Britain endorse organ donation - 90 percent - and the 60 percent of families that give permission upon a relative 's death .
Among many ethnic minorities , the donation figure is as low as 25 percent .
Patients groups blasted the proposal , saying it infringes on patients ' rights over their own bodies .
" They call it presumed consent , but it is no consent at all , " said Joyce Robin of Patient Concern .
" They are relying on inertia and ignorance to get the results that they want .
" Robin said the government has not made enough efforts to increase voluntary donation to justify to such extreme measures .
Manikins ( the alternate spelling , mannequin , is usually used for the store window variety ) which are used for medical training are extremely interesting devices with accurate and working anatomical elements .
This list is larger than usual since the number of interesting items meant that we kept on looking .

So ? … A Note from Michael Moore
Friends ,
It would have to happen on Easter Sunday , would n’t it , that the 4,000th American soldier would die in Iraq .
Play me that crazy preacher again , will you , about how maybe God , in all his infinite wisdom , may not exactly be blessing America these days .
Is anyone surprised ?
4,000 dead .
Unofficial estimates are that there may be up to 100,000 wounded , injured , or mentally ruined by this war .
And there could be up to a million Iraqi dead .
We will pay the consequences of this for a long , long time .
God will keep blessing America .
And where is Darth Vader in all this ?
A reporter from ABC News this week told Dick Cheney , in regards to Iraq , “ two - thirds of Americans say it ’s not worth fighting . ”
Cheney cut her off with a one word answer : “ So ? ”
“ So ? ” As in , “ So what ? ”
As in , “ F*** you .
I could care less . ”
I would like every American to see Cheney flip the virtual bird at the them , the American people .
Click here and pass it around .
Then ask yourself why we have n’t risen up and thrown him and his puppet out of the White House .
The Democrats have had the power to literally pull the plug on this war for the past 15 months — and they have refused to do so .
What are we to do about that ?
Continue to sink into our despair ?
Or get creative ?
Real creative .
I know there are many of you reading this who have the chutzpah and ingenuity to confront your local congressperson .
Will you ?
For me ?
Cheney spent Wednesday , the 5th anniversary of the war , not mourning the dead he killed , but fishing off the Sultan of Oman ’s royal yacht .
So ?
Ask your favorite Republican what they think of that .
The Founding Fathers would never have uttered the presumptuous words , “ God Bless America . ”
That , to them , sounded like a command instead of a request , and one does n’t command God , even if they are America .
In fact , they were worried God would punish America .
During the Revolutionary War , George Washington feared that God would react unfavorably against his soldiers for the way they were behaving .
John Adams wondered if God might punish America and cause it to lose the war , just to prove His point that America was not worthy .
They and the others believed it would be arrogant on their part to assume that God would single out America for a blessing .
What a long road we have traveled since then .
I see that Frontline on PBS this week has a documentary called “ Bush ’s War . ”
That ’s what I ’ve been calling it for a long time .
It ’s not the “ Iraq War . ” Iraq did nothing .
Iraq did n’t plan 9/11 .
It did n’t have weapons of mass destruction .
It DID have movie theaters and bars and women wearing what they wanted and a significant Christian population and one of the few Arab capitals with an open synagogue .
But that ’s all gone now .
Show a movie and you ’ll be shot in the head .
Over a hundred women have been randomly executed for not wearing a scarf .
I ’m happy , as a blessed American , that I had a hand in all this .
I just paid my taxes , so that means I helped to pay for this freedom we ’ve brought to Baghdad .
So ?
Will God bless me ?
God bless all of you in this Easter Week as we begin the 6th year of Bush ’s War .
God help America .
Please .

COLD WAR AND INSURGENCY PROPAGANDA BANKNOTES
SGM Herbert A. Friedman ( Ret . )
Note : Portions of this article were previously published in the Whitman Numismatic Journal , July 1967 and September 1967 , and the International Banknote Society Journal , Volume 24 , Number 1 , 1985 and Volume 30 , Number 1 , 1999 .
Some illustrations from this article were used by The Centre Pompidou ( Paris ) for the autumn 2015 issue of " Les Cahiers du Muse national dart modern . "
The origin of the term " Cold War " is usually attributed to Bernard Baruch , advisor to many American presidents during the turbulent post - war years .
There is no single definition of this term , but we understand it to be a state of continual diplomatic adversity where the great philosophies of the East and West contend on every level except for the actual field of battle .
Bloodless skirmishes are fought between bickering politicians and mighty nations .
Espionage and propaganda campaigns and coups abound .
Information and disinformation is disseminated through every type of media , and even the slightest advantage is considered a major victory in the attempt to win prestige , territory and power through the use of the spoken and written word .
Propaganda becomes extremely important at a time when there is no actual combat by arms .
It allows one side to attack the philosophy and beliefs of another , usually at no risk of escalation .
For this reason , many millions of leaflets were prepared and disseminated on both sides of the " Iron Curtain " , that imaginary wall that divides Europe into East and West and was first mentioned by Winston Churchill in his Westminster College speech of 5 March 1946 .
He said in part : From Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the Adriatic an Iron Curtain has descended across the Continent .
Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe .
Warsaw , Berlin , Prague , Vienna , Budapest , Belgrade , Bucharest and Sofia , all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere , and all are subject in one form or another , not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and , in some cases , increasing measure of control from Moscow .
As in many propaganda battles whether political or revolutionary , leaflets in the form of banknotes were produced by both sides .
Propaganda leaflets may be avoided by patriotic or frightened citizens of a target country , but anyone will pick up a banknote on the street .
That has always been the perfect way to pass insidious propaganda to an unwary reader .
The Americans , British , Germans and Russians all used this technique in WWII .
Half a decade later in the Korean War the United States once again prepared banknote leaflets .
It was just a matter of time before they appeared again during Cold War psychological operations and in revolutionary conflicts where one side sought independence from another .
The only difference was that the banknotes prepared during the shooting wars were government projects and it was understood that they were authorized by the military .
The Cold War and insurgency notes for the most part were prepared by civilian organizations , though certainly in almost every case they were sponsored by some intelligence agency of a government .
We could make a case for calling them " Political Banknotes , " but there are legitimate banknotes prepared by real political parties in favor of candidates and policies .
I first wrote about them in the February 1970 issue of Coins in an article entitled " Political Propaganda Slogans Projected on Paper Money . "
In my computer file of Political Propaganda Currency I have no less than 70 pages of single - spaced entries .
And , I have not added to that list in the past few years .
In fact , to pick a name at random there are 21 political banknotes that attack President Richard Nixon alone .
I depict one here .
So , understand that we are not going to talk about electioneering or political notes .
Therefore , in the case of these pro and anti-Communist and insurgency currency leaflets we have chosen the name " Cold War and Insurgency Banknotes . "
I should stress that there are dozens of such notes that fall into this category .
We can not show them all .
Therefore we have selected some of particular interest for this article .
ALGERIA Algeria was conquered in 1830 by Charles X of France , the last Bourbon king .
The Algerians rose up in revolt in 1954 , which led to a French withdrawal eight years later in 1962 .
During the war , the French fought hard to keep Algeria and prepared dozens of propaganda leaflets .
One in the form of a banknote was a French parody of an Algerian 100 NF ( new francs ) on a 10,000 francs Bank of Algeria and Tunisia note of 28 January 1958 .
The front of the note looks very much like a real banknote and the French placed the message " This note has no commercial value " on it to make sure it was not used as counterfeit currency .
The note had a safe conduct pass on the back showing a photograph of a French soldier accepting a rifle from a smiling guerrilla and his comrade who are being paid cash .
The text on back is in French and Arabic , and says in French : Soldier : rally to us !
Present yourself to a citizen .
He will drive you to a French post .
You will divide the reward while receiving a 10,000 francs banknote .
The Arabic - language text is poorly readable and at about a grade - school level .
It is : Soldier , give yourself up !
Come forward to the one who will take you to the French and you will receive a reward of 10,000 francs .
The French Army and the French citizens living in Algeria refused to admit defeat and attempted to carry on the fight .
The Algerian OAS " Secret Army Organization " produced parodies of the French Banque de France notes of about 1960 .
The parodies have a tab on the left bearing the large initials " O A S " and French text " Reembourse par le Tresor " ( " Payable by the treasury " ) .
The backs have a large " O A S " at left , and at right a portrait and signature of French General Raoul Salan , head of the Secret Army Organization .
Salan led an unsuccess­ful putsch in April 1961 , aimed at preserving French rule in Algeria .
After the failure of the putsch , Salan founded the terrorist OAS , which fought against Algerian independence .
The French captured Salan in 1962 , and he spent 20 years in prison .
The notes I have seen are a parody of the 50 new francs on 5000 francs note of about 1960 .
This parody dates from 1961 or 1962 .
The second is a parody of the 100 new francs note of 12 January 1960 with blue ink on white paper .
The French - language text is : The Secret Army is not a political faction but a genuine Army which aims at the mobilization of the French people in order to protect the fundamental liberties , the social justice and also the integrity and the preservation of the national territory .
Signed SALAN
The money given by the bearer of this voucher is under control and responsibility of the Secret Army .
It will be reimbursed by the OAS Treasury .
AUSTRIA
The Communist Party in Austria prepared two parodies of the 100 schilling Oesterreichische Nationalbank note of 1949 .
The parodies are identical on the front , but differ on the back in both message and format .
One has the propaganda message horizontally while the other has it vertically .
These leaflets , dated 22 February 1953 , were produced by the Wahlgemeinschaft Oesterreichische Volksopposition ( People 's Opposition ) .
The Communists had called themselves Linksblock ( Left - wing bloc ) during the 1949 elections , but changed their name to the more acceptable " People 's Opposition " during the 1953 elections .
No matter what the name , the Austrian people showed little interest , giving the Communists just 4 of 165 seats in their Nationalrat ( Parliament ) .
As in all the leftist productions , the propaganda banknote message attacks the inflation allegedly brought on by the party in power .
On the front of the both notes we see an angel thumbing his nose at a two - faced caricature representing the ruling politicians .
On the back of the note with the horizontal message we find :
For 100 schillings you could buy : Beneath this title are listed a number of products with the amount you could have bought in 1949 and the amount you could purchase in the winter of 1952 / 53 .
Like the rest of the world , Austria suffered through a period of inflation in the early 50's .
Some of the items shown are bread 52 ½ kg down to 28 ½ kg , sugar 23 ½ kg down to 15 ½ kg , milk 71 ½ liters down to 42 liters and coal 278 kg down to 125 kg .
In all , eight different commodities are shown and their prices listed .
The leaflet goes on to attack the OVP and SPO parties and ends with the comment :
Have your salaries , wages and pensions kept in step with these price increases ?
No !
Therefore , let us bear in mind that the governing parties are responsible .
Vote on February 22nd for the People 's Opposition Party .
The message on the second vertical note is similar , except that some different commodities are listed .
We find such items as salt - 63 kg down to 31 kg , and men 's shirts down from two to one .
There is an additional section that attacks the middlemen involved in bringing farm products to the consumers .
This section tells what price the farmer is paid for a commodity and what price the consumer pays .
We are told that for 100 schillings the farmer supplies 16 Kg of beef , 140 Kg of potatoes or 16 liters of wine .
By the time the products reach market , the consumer gets for the same 100 schillings only 4 Kg of beef , 80 Kg of potatoes or 5 liters of wine .
The conclusion is :
These enormous price differences are due to middleman profit and taxes .
Our income has not kept pace with these increased prices .
In the cities and the farms the working man is being exploited .
Therefore , we want to defeat the government and the OVP and SPO parties and the camp followers of the VdU party .
On February 22nd we vote for the Election Union of the Austrian People 's Opposition .
The VdU mentioned in the text was the Verband der Unabhangigen ( Association of Independents ) , a small party of those opposed to the policies of the SPO and OVP , anti-Marxist in character .
They were able to win 14 seats during the 1953 elections .
This propaganda note did not seem to help the Leftists to any great degree .
Looking over the election results and the vote tally between 1949 and 1953 we see that the People 's Party dropped slightly from 1.8 million to 1.78 million , the Socialist Party rose from 1.6 million to 1.88 million , and the Communist Party was only able to generate 15,000 additional votes , rising from 213,000 to 228,000 .
It seems that it takes more than a fancy propaganda banknote to convince the voter that a major change is needed .
The Austrian Communist Party also produced a parody of the 100 shillings Oesterreichische Nationalbank note of 1960 .
The note was printed with the appearances of a corner torn off on both the front and back and in the space we find the German language message in red " Who has torn off a piece here ? "
The note has been folded and when opened reveals the following messages : A stitch in time saves nine .
That is an old proverb .
In 1958 someone had 10,000 schillings in the bank .
But since then , as the OVP and SPO Parties have to admit , 1500 shillings have been eaten away through cost of living increases .
Since 1958 the value of the schilling has been eaten away by fifteen percent .
The reduction in value of the schilling has been greater than the increase in capital by interest .
The devaluation of the schilling particularly affects the working people .
The economic miracle children do not invest their money in savings .
Their puppet schillings have been increased through profiteering during this inflation .
The value of their shares has multiplied .
They are the beneficiaries of this cost increase .
Schilling Elections ?
Yes , but you must vote against people whose politics increased the prices of everything and reduced the size of the schilling . "
The Communist Party of Austria .
The propaganda message on the inside second page is : Schilling elections .
The many schillings which one sees on today 's poster boards are something that should be in one 's pocket .
Just before the elections , the OVP and SPO parties suddenly discovered their concern for the schilling .
At night , the lazy become diligent .
For years the inflation has reduced the value of salaries and pensions .
During the last year this increase has been particularly large .
The SPO blames the OVP and the OVP blames the SPO for the increase in prices , but did they not govern together ?
Were not all decisions of the government and parliament made unanimously ?
Both government parties are jointly responsible for the price increases .
He who wants to fight against inflation votes Communist and Left Wing Socialist .
The political parties that are being attacked in this propaganda banknote are the two that ruled Austria for twenty years after the war .
The " OVP " is the Osterreichische Volkpartei ( Austrian People 's Party ) and the " SPO " is the Sozialistische Partei Osterreichs ( Austrian Socialist Party ) .
The Austrian Communist Party Kommunistische Partei Osterreichs or ( KPO ) never had any real following .
They were able to win five seats in Parliament in 1949 , but by 1959 they had no representation in the government .
The Austrian Press and Information Service located in New York City was kind enough to explain that during October 21 and 22 1960 , negotiations for the 1961 budget broke down .
It was another week before the Austrian political parties could agree on expenses .
CANADA Independent - minded French citizens in the province of Quebec have clamored to be separated from the rest of Canada for many years .
They have fought both politically and in some cases , with terrorism .
Two parody banknotes are known to be connected with these movements , although that connection is not always clear .
The first banknote would appear to be a Front de Liberation de Quebec ( FLQ ) terrorist note , inscribed " Une piastre / Banque de la Republique du Quebec " , greenish - black , with various French patriotic symbols .
A marching mob with independence placards are depicted on the back .
In fact , the notes were prepared in the late 1960s by the Chevaliers de Independence , a small organization of rioters depicted on the back of the note .
It was apparently designed for publicity and fund - raising , and the marcher at the head of the mob is Reggie Chartrand , their leader .
The Royal Canadian Mounted Police captured and destroyed the main hoard of notes after the October 1970 crisis that saw the kidnapping and death of Quebec labor minister Pierre LaPorte and the kidnapping of British trade commis­sioner James Cross .
The FLQ was formed about 1963 as a cellular terrorist organization with Cuban trainers .
On the night of 15 October 1970 The Canadian government declared martial law in Montreal .
The military searches turned up weapons , explosives and propaganda leaflets printed in China and Cuba .
A second banknote parody is a Canadian " FLQ " terrorist note , black on green , inscribed " Une piastre " and " Bastille 1789 / Quebec 19 ??. "
The leaflet was issued by the Front for the Liberation of Quebec .
The front and back are similar , with a proposed French Canadian flag as a central emblem on one side , and an FLQ badge as the central emblem on the other side .
A nine - paragraph publicity flyer was released along with the propaganda banknote .
Some of the text is :
The storming of the Bastille in 1789 is symbolic of French liberty and the hope of gaining the same freedom in 19 ?? for themselves .
The outline heavy black line signifies the intention of the French Canadians to establish a republic wall around Quebec but leaving the corners open to trade and commerce and diplomatic relations with the rest of the Canadian republic and the rest of the world .
The inner black lines protected by the F.L.Q. represent the inner walls of the sanctuary which will protect the culture , language and religion of the French Canadian people .
In other words the wish to revive the American spirit of 1776 and the French spirit of 1789 in order to show the way of independence and the forming of the republic of Canada to its sister provinces .
Some Canadian genuine banknotes have been overprinted with a rubber stamp inscription " Nous voulons le Quebec Libre , " ( " We want a free Quebec " ) .
Notes from the anti-Quebec Liberation movement also exist .
Some stress the economic repercussion that would occur if " liberation " were achieved .
One banknote resembles the Canadian one dollar bill but pictures Parti Quebecois leader Renee Levesque at the right and the words " The price of the separation " at the left in French .
About one - third of the left of the note is blank , implying the loss of purchasing power of the banknote .
There are two such notes , one depicting a portrait of Levesque issued in Sherbrooke in late 1970 , the other issued by the Liberal Party in Lafleche about the same time .
CUBA
I hesitate to mention these banknotes as part of a Cold War operation because they were allegedly to be used in the Bay of Pigs invasion .
However , one would assume that the notes were printed well before the invasion and because they were such good imitations were probably used before and after the invasion in an attempt to harm the Cuban economy .
It is alleged that the United States CIA forged Cuban 20 pesos Banco Nacional de Cuba notes of 1961 for the Bay of Pigs invasion .
According to Alejandro Quesada in The Bay of Pigs : Cuba 1961 , Osprey Publishing , 2009 : Each Brigade member taking part in the invasion was issued approximately 100 counterfeit Cuban pesos made by the CIA .
This money was intended for purchasing supplies from the peasants and / or bribery .
However , a news item in Bank Note Reporter of June 1987 , entitled " Cuban counterfeit deleted from Pick " reports that Cuban sources claimed that these items were privately produced , and were not made by the CIA .
We tend to doubt the veracity of this report , delayed 25 years .
We note that the Paper Money Guarantee ( PMG ) Company slabbed the note on occasion and identified it as " USA C.I.A. Counterfeit - Bay of Pigs Invasion Force Issue . "
The forgery ; or a similar operation is mentioned in Bay of Pigs , Peter Wyden , Simon and Schuster , New York , 1979 .
Wyden says :
When two million worth of pesos came ashore in four jute sacks that had gotten wet , the sacks were leaking blue , red , and green liquid , but the underground workers were only mildly annoyed .
They knew that the CIA was sending them counterfeit money ; that the printing and the paper were excellent but the ink was so unreliable you could usually wipe it off with saliva .
The counterfeit money , tens and twenties , was used by middlemen who bought expensive items such as cars from people they hoped never to see again .
The currency supplied to the infiltrators for their own use was authentic ; at least the ink did not run .
The forgeries are rather easy to spot because of their serial numbers or lack of same .
Four types are known : 1 . F69 at left ; no serial number at right .
2 . F69 at left ; reduced size serial number at right .
3 . F70 at left ; no serial number at right .
4 . F70 at left : serial number at right .
Very little has appeared in the U.S. press about the PSYOP of the invasion of the Bay of Pigs .
It was a classified CIA operation .
However , the Communists felt no need to keep any secrets and the book by Juan Carlos Rodriquez , The Inevitable Battle - From the Bay of Pigs to Playa Giron , Editorial Capitan San Luis , Havana , Cuba , 2013 , although Cuban propaganda , does talk a lot about American PSYOP .
Some of his data seems to be from the formerly classified CIA 's own Inspector 's General Survey of the Cuban Operation .
Some of the comments are : A psychological warfare campaign had been carried out by radio stations prepared especially for that purpose .
One of them had gone on the air eleven months earlier : Radio Swan ( Radio Free Cuba ) , which came in clearly , powerfully , and with a triumphal tone .
Swan Island was a small island in the Gulf of Honduras .
The American command post was set up in a Washington DC building known as Quarters Eye .
Propaganda plans were drawn up for psychologically softening up the Cuban people ...
This was the source of pamphlets dropped over the island ...
Cuba did not have sufficient or adequate radar equipment ... several small planes in the Florida Keys dropped hundreds of thousands of pamphlets urging people to carry out sabotage , set fire to sugar cane fields and to attack militia members .
In Happy Valley , Nicaragua , the operations base for Brigade 2506 , 11 million brochures were ready to be dropped over Cuban territory ...
By the time of the invasion , a total of 12 million pounds of leaflets had been dropped on Cuba .
The CIA estimates for the cost of propaganda operations was $ 500,000 in fiscal year 1960 and $ 1,200,000 in fiscal year 1961 .
Usually , when one nation counterfeits the currency of another nation , it attempts to keep that act secret .
Here , the United States seems to almost be saying to the Cubans " we did it , " and thumbing its nose at them .
This is a U.S. Army Special Forces training war game note against the mock nation of " Red . "
The same 20 peso note counterfeited for use in Cuba has now been parodied and turned into a safe conduct pass to be used by any Red soldier wanting to surrender or defect .
There are also anti-Castro overprints known on various Cuban banknotes .
For instance , U.S. News and World Report stated on May 20 , 1963 that evidence was mounting that harassment of Fidel Castro 's Communist regime was growing inside Cuba .
Cuba's one peso banknote depicted Castro's Triumphal entry into Havana in 1959 , but on many of the notes in circulation , anti-Castro forces had printed the message : Valueless for food .
Valueless for clothing .
Because Communism is hunger , misery and destruction .
This is the work of the great traitor .
Numerous propaganda leaflets were printed along with the fake banknotes .
This Miami Herald staff photograph taken by Bill Kuenzel depicts a number of anti-Castro sabotage and propaganda leaflets washed up on Miami Beach on 26 July , 1963 .
One of the leaflets depicts two ways to sabotage a telephone and text .
Many of the leaflets end with " Sabotage is necessary for liberty " and " Russians : out of Cuba . "
Another depicts cogs in machine and an oil can and asks Cuban workers to sabotage production by breaking machinery and not oiling it .
A third propaganda leaflet depicts an automobile motor and radiator .
It tells the Cubans : If it is necessary to damage official vehicles or those confiscated from businesses .
Zero oil to the motor .
Zero water to the radiator .
A fourth leaflet depicts a hand dropping a lit match into flammable materials and tells the Cubans :
It causes fires ... Drop matches or cigars where there are rags , straw , wood , paper and fuel .
We know a good deal about the propaganda missions over Cuba from the CIA Official History of the Bay of Pigs Operation .
Documents on air operations show that in late November 1960 , a major air strike was planned for B - 26's bombers carrying both ordnance and leaflets against unspecified targets in Cuba .
Two other B - 26s flew a propaganda drop on 12 December 1960 .
They worked the western end of Cuba , from the Isle of Pines to Cienfuegos , including Havana ; and on the same night , a C - 54 cargo aircraft dropped leaflets in the Manzanillo area .
The total leaflets dropped during the three December 1960 missions by the B26s were 1,700 pounds and 1000 pounds of leaflets .
The C - 54 dropped 1,000 pounds of leaflets .
It appears that the limited aircraft assigned to the invasion were unable to drop all the leaflets that had been printed .
On 15 February 1961 , 75,000 leaflets asking teachers to support a student strike were available from Miami for an upcoming drop and that 100 pounds of materials bearing the " fish symbol " were also ready for use in a drop aimed at Villanueva University in Havana .
On 18 February , a cable stated that there were approximately 18,000 pounds of leaflets in a warehouse ready for pickup .
In all , there were 23 leaflet drops between 12 December 1960 and the collapse of the Bay of Pigs Operation .
About 12 million leaflets were dropped in addition to assorted publications .
The CIA report mentions some specific leaflets .
One suggestion was that leaflets should be prepared depicting the crucifix upside down , to signify the Soviet treatment of religion , and that these leaflets should be distributed widely through Cuba .
There is no indication that this particular leaflet was ever printed .
In another instance , the Hammer and Sickle was used to form the " T " in the word " Traidor " on a sticker that was prepared for propaganda use .
In anticipation of the possible visit , 10,000 stickers of an anti-Khrushchev , anti-Soviet nature were forwarded from Headquarters to Havana Station .
The legend on one of these was " Cuba , Yes ; Russia , No ; Khrushchev , No ; " and a second item showed a prisoner behind bars formed by the stripes of the Cuban flag with the words Sin Palabras , " Without word . "
The stickers were never used .
The United States prepared a leaflet in the form of a 5 peso note as it prepared to drive the Cubans and Marxist government out of Grenada .
The Grenada story began on 13 March 1979 when Maurice Bishop overthrew the legitimate government and established a communist society .
The New Joint Endeavor for Welfare , Education , and Liberation ( New Jewel Movement ) ousted Sir Eric Gairy , Grenada 's first Prime Minister , and established a people 's revolutionary government .
Grenada began construction of a 10,000 foot international airport with the help of Cuba .
There was speculation that this airfield could be used to land military fighters and transports , threatening South America and the southern United States .
President Ronald Reagan accused Grenada of constructing facilities to aid a Soviet and Cuban military build - up in the Caribbean .
There was also worry about the large number of weapons flowing into Grenada .
One shipment in 1979 contained 3400 rifles and 3 million rounds of ammunition .
In addition , there were about 600 American medical students studying in Grenada and another 400 foreign citizens .
The safety of these Americans became a factor when Maurice Bishop and several members of his cabinet were murdered by elements of the people 's revolutionary army on 13 October 1983 .
The even more reactionary and violent Deputy Prime Minister Bernard Coard who led a Marxist - influenced group within the Grenadian Army replaced Bishop .
President Reagan called the leaders of the new government " A brutal group of leftist thugs . "
The United States reacted to the bloody coup in Grenada within two weeks .
On 25 October 1983 American troops landed on the beaches of Grenada .
They were assisted in part by members of the Organization of Eastern Caribbean States ( OECS ) , specifically Barbados , Jamaica , Antigua , Dominica , St Lucia and St Vincent .
They were opposed by Grenadian and Cuban military units and military advisors from the Soviet Union , North Korea , East Germany , Bulgaria , and Libya .
The propaganda banknote was depicted in the book Grenada - Revolution , Invasion and Aftermath , Hugh O'Shaughnessy , Sphere Books , London , 1984 .
He describes it as : Safe conduct pass in the form of a Cuban 5 peso banknote bearing the picture of Antonio Maceo , black hero of Cuban independence ( Authors note : Antonio Maceo y Grajales , 1845 - 1896 ) .
Distributed by U.S. troops for use by Cubans during the October invasion .
I later wrote this leaflet up in the International Banknote Society Journal , Volume 30 , No. 4 , 1991 .
The banknote leaflet parodied the Cuban 5 peso note of 1961 - 1965 .
The genuine Cuban note is green , but the propaganda note is crudely drawn in bright pink - violet .
The text on the front in both English and Spanish is : SAFE CONDUCT PASS
To those who are resisting the Caribbean Peace Force .
You will be taken to a safe place where your needs will be met .
Food , clothing , shelter and medical treatment are available .
The back of the banknote leaflet has " SAFE CONDUCT " at the top and bottom of the note in English and Spanish .
Stanley Sandler points out in Cease Resistance : it 's good for you : a History of U.S. Army Combat Psychological Operations :
The use of a Cuban rather than a Grenadian note showed that planners were understandably more concerned with resistance from the Cuban construction battalions than any from the rag -tag Grenadian local defense forces .
Before we leave this interesting propaganda leaflet that parodies a Cuban 5 peso banknote we should point out that the U.S. military apparently liked this vignette .
In the years afterwards the same banknote leaflet was used numerous times in war games and training exercises where U.S. Army Special Forces had to work with and pay mock rebel forces .
Here , in a war game between the nations of Costa and Ventura this banknote offers safe conduct and humane treatment to any soldier of Costa who turns himself in .
Variations of this banknote leaflet were used in at least a half - dozen other war games .
CZECHOSLOVAKIA
Note : Some of the Operation Prospero material in this article was used , with author 's permission , in the Brian Kannard book Steinbeck : Citizen Spy , Grave Distractions Publications , Nashville , TN , 2013 .
The first such propaganda banknote we will discuss is a parody of the Czechoslovak State Bank one Koruna of 1953 .
This story began in June , 1953 when the Czech Government launched a major currency reform .
Western experts believed that many thousands of workers and farmers would have their life savings wiped out as a result of this massive currency change .
This was considered an excellent opportunity for an anti-Communist campaign by the West and the Crusade for Europe organization , in conjunction with Radio Free Europe , designed a leaflet and radio attack to take advantage of the situation .
The leaflets were ordered by Free Europe Press , a division of the Free Europe Committee and prepared by Reynolds Offset , a New York City print shop , in sheets of 40 ( 8 across and 5 down ) .
Ken Graeber was the printer .
He said :
The two men who brought it into the plant made any number of cryptic remarks about its secrecy .
We would be reading about it soon they said , and there were remarks about " balloons . "
I do not recall how many we printed but it was not one of our larger jobs ... perhaps less than three days run on the press .
This project was explained in a small booklet entitled A New Weapon , published by the Free Europe Press .
The operation was named " Prospero . "
It would involve the sending of 6,512 balloons and saturation broadcasts at the rate of twenty hours a day from the RFE transmitters located at Holz - kirchen , West Germany .
This was a hurriedly prepared tactical exercise prompted by the riots in Prague , Pilsen , and Ostrava brought on by the drastic Czechoslovak currency reforms that effectively wiped out the savings of the population .
The operation was closely coordinated with radio broadcasts by RFE's " Voice of Free Czechoslovakia . "
Allan A. Michie talks about the start of the balloon campaign in Voices through the Iron Curtain : the Radio Free Europe Story , Dodd / Mead , 1963 :
In the summer of 1951 , the free Europe Committee acquired a stock of large weather balloons , about four feet in diameter when inflated , and decided to launch them from Germany across to Czechoslovakia , taking advantage of the prevailing west to east winds in the upper attitudes .
Working at night from a wheat field only three miles from the Czechoslovak frontier , a crew of German workers stuffed the balloons with leaflets , inflated them with hydrogen and sailed them across the border .
Each balloon carried some 3,000 leaflets .
Richard H. Cummings tells us more about the balloons in his article , " Balloons over East Europe : America 's Covert radio and Leaflet Operations in the Cold War . "
He says that in 1948 , under the code name " Project Ultimate , " the CIA 's Special Procedures Group ( SPG ) had a printing press and stockpile of world war two meteorological balloons to carry and deliver propaganda leaflets into East European countries in the event of war .
He continues :
The first balloons were launched on 12 August 1951 in an open field only 3 miles from the Czechoslovak border .
This test operation , known as the " Winds of Freedom , " was on an experimental stand - alone basis , i.e. , the launching of the balloons was not part of a coordinated programming effort with Radio Free Europe broadcasts .
The Free Europe Press ( FEP ) printed up millions of propaganda leaflets to be launched .
The leaflets contained such slogans as " A new hope is stirring , " and " Friends of Freedom in other lands have found a new way to reach you . "
Cummings mentions the campaign again in the book Cold War Radio : the Dangerous History of American Broadcasting in Europe 1950 - 1989 , McFarland & Company , Jefferson , North Carolina and London , 2009 .
He says in part : Prospero was the code name for the RFE balloon program in summer 1953 , when in a time span of only four days , 6.5000 balloons with over 12 million RFE leaflets were launched into Czechoslovakia ...
The regime responded to Prospero by using military aircraft and anti-aircraft weapons along the border to shoot down the balloons the day after the first launching ...
Police cars in Prague and elsewhere used loudspeakers ordering citizens to turn in all the leaflets ...
Because of the violent reaction and the media attacks , RFE inadvertently discovered that the balloon program was more successful than first planned .
Arch Puddington mentions the balloon campaign in Broadcasting Freedom , University Press of Kentucky , 2000 .
Puddington says : A major goal of the balloon campaign was to provide the Radio Free Europe audience with something approximating a free press .
In addition ... the Free Europe Press produced small newspapers in editions of two million , which were dropped more or less regularly to Poland , Hungary and Czechoslovakia between 1954 and 1956 .
The Free Europe Press eventually built at least three launch sites in Bavaria and near the West German - Austria border ... the annual cost of maintaining one launch site was nearly $ 500,000 .
On the nights of 13 through 17 July 1953 , over twelve million leaflets were sent from the German - Czech border by 6,500 balloon .
There were three different types of leaflets , including a propaganda banknote produced by RFE similar to the original banknote in size and color , but with the addition of a message block with text at the upper right on the front and at the upper left on the back of the note .
The message was translated in the article " West Wind over Prague , " published in News From Behind the Iron Curtain , August 1953 : MEN CALL THIS THE HUNGER CROWN - GIFT OF THE SOVIET UNION
It is the proof of the government 's helplessness and bankruptcy of the five - year plan , a remembrance of what you have had stolen by the government .
It is the appeal to fight , the appeal to direct the people 's power against the weakness of the regime and to resist as best you can .
The peoples of other countries enslaved by the Soviet Union are writing and will join you in your struggle .
The free world is with you .
All power belongs to the people !
On the other side of the parody banknote the text is : CZECHS AND SLOVAKS
The regime is weakening and is afraid of you .
The power is in the people and the people are against the regime .
Unite and mobilize your forces !
Down with the collective farms !
Insist on the rights of the workers !
Today demand concessions , tomorrow freedom !
At the same time , anti-Soviet messages were broadcast by the propaganda radio stations : The Soviet Union is growing weaker .
Only those will survive who detach themselves from the Communist boat in time ...
Everywhere in the Free World your friends are with you ... All power to the people .
On Prospero 's final night lighted lanterns were attached to the balloons for dramatic effect .
The second " leaflet " was in the form of an aluminum 25 Heller coin stamped with the Freedom Bell and the text : All Czechs and Slovaks for Freedom .
All the Free World for the Czechs and Slovaks .
Arch Puddington mentions the origin of the Freedom bell : Some four hundred thousand Germans lined the streets of West Berlin on October 24 , 1950 , to cheer General Lucius Clay , the hero of the Berlin Airlift and the figure who symbolized the Free World alliance of the United States and Europe ...
And there was the bell itself : eight feet high , weighing more than 10 tons , it was essentially a replica of the original Liberty Bell in Philadelphia 's Liberty Hall ...
The bell was sponsored , and it was assumed , paid for by a new organization called the Crusade for Freedom ... Clay then pressed the button that would ring the bell .
Its deep peels could be heard in the Soviet sector of the city , ten miles away .
The third leaflet was a one - page sheet with pictures of the Berlin uprising and a description of the ferment inside the USSR , including the purge of Beria .
At the same time that the balloons were floating overhead , RFE was playing a song specially written for the occasion , " The Iron Curtain Does Not Reach the Sky " .
The radio advised finders of the leaflets to hand a small percentage over to the police to protect themselves and pass the rest on to friends and neighbors .
On 18 July , Rude Pravo , official organ of the Czechoslovak Communist Party , published a lengthy article attacking this campaign and likening it to Hitler 's hate - propaganda .
It said in part :
Our citizens arrive with expressions of justified disgust at the leaflets , and they find offense in one leaflet which is some kind of copy of the new Czechoslovak Koruna , covered on both sides by a slanderous text .
Our people respect the new Koruna , its firm purchasing power which enabled us to discard the ration system , and therefore they deplore , in harsh and not too selective language , that the effigy of the Koruna has been misused for printing on it stupid lies and slander against the government of our Republic and against the Soviet Union .
Several attempts were made to end this campaign of balloon warfare .
In late 1954 a Czech agent was apprehended as he attempted to cross the border with forged papers .
When questioned , he explained that he had been ordered to burn the balloon launching site at Tirschenreuth .
When asked why he carried a weapon , he replied that his orders were to kill anyone who tried to stop him .
The Communist military forces were also involved in an attempt to stop the spread of the Western propaganda .
On 15 July 1953 , Russian - built MiG - 15 jet fighters attacked the airborne balloons and were credited with two " kills . "
It was reported that anti-aircraft batteries downed three more .
According to an article entitled " Balloons and the Big Lie " , published in East Europe , July , 1958 , the Czechs also attempted to keep the propaganda out of the hands of their citizens by claiming that the balloons were dangerous , carried explosives , germs and incendiary devices .
When a Czechoslovak Airlines passenger plane crashed on 18 January 1956 , killing twenty - two passengers and crew , they claimed that the aircraft had been brought down by a Free Europe Press propaganda balloon .
The United States refuted this claim , stating that the aircraft was flying in an area of poor visibility with high wind velocities and icing conditions .
The US explanation was that the pilot was attempting to find a landing site other than Poprad Airfield in the High Tatra Mountains and while flying in extremely high winds , dependent on instruments , had crashed into a hill due to faulty altimeter settings .
There is no way to determine what , if any , results were achieved by this psychological warfare operation .
In 1956 a count was made of all the references to balloons and leaflets in the Communist press .
It was found that the Czechs had complained about these propaganda campaigns no less than 487 times .
There were 1,303 complaints in the entire Communist bloc during the months of January and February 1956 alone .
The United States may not have changed many minds , but if nothing else , it seems to have cut heavily into their supply of printer 's ink .
GERMANY
There were other interesting psywar operations being carried out in 1953 .
The East Germans had risen up and attempted to throw out their Russian masters .
This revolt had been brutally put down .
Once again , this was seen as an opportunity to strike at the Communist system .
The West Berlin printing house Standard Verlag produced a fine parody of the German Democratic Republic 20 Mark note of 1948 .
This printing firm was alleged to have been connected with Radio Free Europe .
It produced a number of anti-Communist publications such as magazines , newspapers and leaflets .
Probably the best known publication was the satirical magazine Tarantel , an eight ‑page satirical periodical in printed Berlin and sent by balloon into East Germany .
It regularly attacked Russian control of the German Democratic Republic .
They also published an English - language newsletter entitled International Press Service .
Much of this material was sent into Germany through the Radio Free Europe balloons , the postal system , small rockets and , in some cases , simply throwing the literature out of the windows of trains moving through Germany .
Time mentioned Tarantel in an article entitled " Armed with a Snicker , " 12 January 1959 .
It said in part :
Tied to a balloon or bobbing down a canal in a bottle , the little magazine slips each month into Communist East Germany from the Western zone of Berlin .
The cover of the contraband Tarantel ( tarantula ) proclaims that it is " priceless , " but for East Germans caught chuckling over the magazine 's sledgehammer humor , the price can be a term in a Red prison .
Despite its problems of distribution and retribution , Tarantel is a big success among East Germans .
Reason : the butt of humor for Tarantel is East Germany 's Communist government .
Each month about half of Tarantel 's press run of 250,000 - 300,000 goes to West Berliners ; the rest is slipped into East Germany .
Tarantel is designed for hidden persuasion : the size of a theater program , it can be concealed in a book , fits easily into a standard German envelope .
The remarkable distribution system includes mailings from other countries , including Russia , and delivery by underground members , who delight in dropping copies into Stalin Alice mailboxes and onto the bookshelves of the Soviet House of Culture .
Replies to a standard request for reader comment ( " Do n't forget to use a false return address " ) show that Tarantel is regularly read all over East Germany .
The 20 Mark parody banknote is brighter and sharper than the original note .
It is very colorful and printed on high quality glossy paper .
The propaganda text is found at the upper left diagonally on the front and the lower right diagonally on the back .
This strange system allows the note to be folded in such a way that no text can be seen .
The advantage of this system is that even the most diehard Communist who might never look at Western propaganda would be tempted to pick up this banknote .
Once it was in his hands , it was hoped that he could not resist reading the message .
And what was the message ?
It was an attack on the Russian control of the Currency of the German Democratic Republic .
The text on the front stated : Comrades !
All money circulated begins and ends in Moscow .
There go our notes of protest , and also there go our banknotes .
We have to take leave of them as soon as we hear their sound in our pay envelope .
The government stores ask more money than a working man owns ; cost what it will , this prosperity has to be defended at any price .
Because through the help of our Soviet friends , the East Mark exchange value was put at such a high level that swindle is unavoidable .
This results from the backing the friends of our government gave for it .
Without this backing even a healthy exchange of money would not be possible .
There is a serial number " F17653 " that translates to " Freedom 17 June 1953 , " the date of the East German uprisings .
On the back of the note the text is : Appearances can deceive , and so can this note - Its value is nothing but noise and smoke , because the Party sends 10 out of every 20 marks to Moscow .
We should mention that because the group preparing this leaflet normally wrote satire , the note is heavily laced with puns and double meanings .
The message can be translated with some other more insulting comments about the Communist leadership .
The Tarantel organization was also responsible for a small mock - gold coin that bears anti-Communist propaganda on the front and back .
The front of the coin depicts a large " W " and the words Wir Wollen Wahlen ( " We want to vote " ) .
On the back of the coin a hand is depicted with three fingers raised to form a " W " and the German text that translates to " Economic Welfare , Vote , Reunification . "
The East German 20 Mark note was quite a popular target for anti-Communist groups .
We will now discuss another organization that also used it to carry anti-Soviet propaganda .
The Narodno Trudovoy Soyuz Rossiyskikh Solidaristov ( Popular Labor Alliance of Russian Solidarists ) is a non-Communist , Russian political organization founded in Belgrade in 1930 to offer a democratic alternative to the Soviet Communist Party .
This organization , known as the " NTS , " is probably the most feared of the patriotic movements that fought against the USSR .
For forty years they produced leaflet and radio propaganda .
They sent numerous agents behind the Iron Curtain .
The initials , besides standing for the organization , are also used for two patriotic slogans Nesem tiranam smert ( We are bringing death to tyrants ) and Nesem trudiashimsia svobodu ( We are bringing liberty to the workers ) .
The background of this group is told in a booklet NTS , published by Possev - Verlag in 1961 .
It explains that the NTS is a revolutionary movement , with the ultimate goal of overthrowing the Soviet regime .
In 1953 , a special instruction to the Soviet Secret Service signed by the Minister of State Security , called the NTS : Enemy Number One of the Soviet Union Possev - Verlag ( The Sowing - Printing House ) was first established by the NTS in 1945 at the Moenchehof Displaced Persons Camp .
After several moves caused by Communist verbal and physical attacks , it was permanently quartered in the suburbs of Frankfurt , West Germany .
The printing presses produced over 100 million copies of various types of literature and sent them to Russia and other East European countries since 1945 .
This literature was inserted between the goods in crates destined for the USSR , thrown in waterproof containers into rivers flowing across the border , mailed to known addresses , carried by agents crossing the Iron Curtain secretly and flown over in balloons .
Suppress the power of the Communists !
Have you found your place in the revolutionary struggle for freedom in Russia ?
Things which are worth living for are worth dying for .
Arise , all you who are strong in spirit - your motherland awaits you .
The Soviets hated the organization .
In 1957 , the newspaper Literaturnaya Gazeta wrote :
In March 1953 , the NTS printed 14 million leaflets and dispatched them by balloon from the German Federal Republic in an easterly direction .
It has been ascertained that the NTS sends not only leaflets , but also secret agents into the countries of Eastern Europe ...
Sovetskaya Moldavia said in 1960 :
Any means are legitimate to the NTS in their work of spreading anti-Soviet forgeries throughout the country .
Pamphlets , leaflets , calumnious letters are sent to such addresses as they succeed in obtaining ; these are slipped into parcels of books , in folders , into the packing of machinery imported from abroad .
The balloons , over 20 meters in diameter , could lift a maximum payload of 90 kilograms .
A special mechanism insured the successive release of printed material every 400 - 500 kilometers .
By the use of these and smaller meteorological balloons , NTS flew 86,867,000 leaflets into the USSR between 1951 and 1956 .
In particular , innumerable leaflets , small brochures and special editions were printed during the Hungarian Revolution of 1956 and the Berlin Uprising of 1953 .
In regard to the latter , we quote from The House of Secrets , Gordon Young , Duell Sloan and Pearce , NY , 1959 : Inhabitants of various towns in East Germany from time to time have been astonished to find lying on pavements , in parks , on barroom floors and elsewhere realistic - looking twenty - mark banknotes .
Eagerly they have picked them up - only to find that on the back side was printed an appeal by the NTS and the request that the well - counterfeited notes should be passed on to some Russian friend .
Puddington mentions the NTS in Broadcasting Freedom :
In the mid-fifties , the countries of Communist Eastern Europe were inundated with balloon leaflets sponsored by a variety of sources .
The CIA had its own balloon project .
So did the shadowy anti-Soviet Narodny Trudovoi Soyuz , the National Labor Union ... The NTS boasted a global network of agents and a core of devoted supporters within the Soviet Union who championed an ideology of anticommunism and Russian nationalism .
The NTS tried to reach the Soviet Union by launching their balloons from West Berlin .
The NTS propaganda banknote is a close match to the genuine German Democratic Republic 20 Mark of 1948 .
The colors are a bit more somber , being a duller , darker brown with none of the bright highlights found on the original .
The paper of the parody is also darker with a brownish tinge .
The genuine is printed on a bright , white paper .
The serial number of the propaganda note is in " XV 471200 " in brown , while the genuine notes have their serial number in red .
Generally speaking , even with the differences in shade , the notes could easily be confused , since the NTS product was prepared photographically from the original and certainly has the appearance of currency at first glance .
There are two types of NTS 20 Mark propaganda notes known at present .
One has the Russian title Dorogie Drovzia ( Dear Friends ) , the other Soldati I Ofitsieri ( Soldiers and officers ) .
Both have a second propaganda message in German which has the heading Deutsche Freude ( German friends ) .
Both notes are sometimes found with a Cyrillic overprint in red which translates to " specimen . "
The Russian language message of the Soldati I Ofitsieri leaflet is : Soldiers and Officers !
On the 17th of June 1953 , the workers of Berlin rose in protest .
They rose against the Communist regime .
In two days the uprising covered the entire zone .
In panic , the government sent out tanks against the workers .
Heeding the call of the NTS , the tankers refused to shoot the revolutionists .
We understand the plight of the Germans .
They were waiting for us to come to their rescue and help them get back their Fatherland .
The attempted uprising of the 17th of June was not in vain .
At this moment , in the Eastern Zone , there is again a stormy situation .
A general uprising is liable to break out at any moment .
It is our duty to support them .
Do n't shoot into the revolutionists !
Join with them in their struggle against the common enemy - the Communist regime .
The union of the German fighters and our own soldiers is a good assurance of victory in the struggle of our own and of the German people .
Long Live the Peoples Revolution !
The message is signed by " The Revolutionary Staff of the NTS " .
Directly below this message to the Russian military we find the second message written in German : German Friends !
The NTS is a Russian revolutionary organization , and is fighting the Communist regime .
The NTS is addressing itself in Russian text to the Soviet soldiers .
The NTS is appealing to the Soviet soldiers for a new uprising in the zone , not to shoot at the Germans , but to unite with them .
Only the union of the Russians and the Germans guarantees a successful uprising , and brings freedom to both nations .
Help spread this leaflet .
Once again the message ends with " NTS - The Revolutionary Staff " .
The leaflet also bears symbols such as the three - pronged pitchfork , which is the symbol of the NTS and represents the unity of workers , farmers and intellectuals in the new national revolution .
It is doubtful that many East Germans passed these on to their Russian allies as requested by the NTS .
Besides being inhospitable , it was probably extremely dangerous .
Do we know of any other western propaganda banknotes sent against the Communist regimes by the NTS ?
Dr. Julius Mader mentions another in an article entitled " Counterfeit Money as a Weapon of the USA " , published in The Baltic Sea Newspaper , 12 September 1981 .
He claims that a CIA - front organization ( possibly the NTS ) counterfeited German Democratic Republic I mark notes of 1948 and disseminated them by balloon in 1953 .
Mader says all of the counterfeits have the serial number " AM 7090673 . "
The text on the back of these notes is : Germany 's unity in freedom
Secures in the East and West
The equal purchasing power of our currency in all of Germany .
Therefore , fight the red oppressors
Until they are destroyed .
Council of the Free German Workers and Peasants
In the Soviet Occupation Zone .
Did the Communists fight back with propaganda material of their own ?
Of course they did .
One of the most interesting items was a parody of the West German 10 Mark Bank Deutsch Lander note of 1949 .
The note is a good photographic copy .
The color of the parody is all blue , whereas the genuine note also has a small amount of red scrollwork .
The printing of the fraud is slightly blurred compared to the original note .
However , the imitation is good enough to have been passed as legitimate currency in several cases .
The radio and press warned the public about attempting to use the fake currency , but several people were unconvinced and as a direct result ended up charged with passing counterfeit currency .
It is believed that the radio campaign which promised immediate prosecution and severe sentencing to anyone caught passing these frauds held this criminal act to a minimum .
The parody was printed on both front and back .
The serial number of the fraud is " N3061371J . "
The note has been folded and it is only when opened that the propaganda text appears .
The West German police reported that these notes were found in a printing plant in West Germany .
The same premises were also found to have been publishing Free People , the official organ of the illegal Central Committee of the Communist Party of Germany .
The police had searched for this printing plant for two years and found it just as it was about to go into full production .
When the warehouse of this firm was raided , the great majority of the propaganda banknotes were confiscated and destroyed .
However , between one and two thousand were distributed before the raid occurred .
The authorities stated that the Communist Party had produced numerous other types of anti-West propaganda to be disseminated during the parliamentary elections of 1957 .
When opened up , the following message in German was exposed :
This bill naturally is not genuine .
But have you ever given any thought to the fact that the 10 Mark bill in your pocketbook is also a fraud ?
You cannot buy 10 DM worth of goods for such a note , since about 2.50 DM of this bill has to go to taxes for the Adenauer Government .
So as not to be so noticeable , the Government has added these taxes to the prices of goods . "
A chart is then shown which lists various highly taxed consumer goods .
We find coffee , tea , sugar , matches and cigarettes .
The taxes on each are listed and the percentages run from 19 to 57.5 % .
The message ends with the statement :
These examples can be continued at random .
And what does the Government do with the 2.50 DM ?
It goes for soldiers , guns , tanks , planes and atomic armaments .
Do you earn your money for that ?
No !
Therefore on September 15th , do away with Atom Adenauer , vote no for the Christian Democratic Union / Christian Socialist Union .
The party of the tax oppressors and armament - hyenas .
Vote Socialist Democratic Party !
The German Communist Party .
When we first saw this propaganda note , we wondered why the Communists would support the party of Willy Brandt , a man who was perceived as strongly pro-American in the early 1950's and who had once stated in 1949 :
You can not be a democrat without being anti-Communist .
He had joined with President John Kennedy at the Berlin Wall and cheered when the young American made his famous " I am a Berliner " comment .
At the time it was believed that this banknote was an attempt to smear Brandt , perhaps with Adenauer 's blessing .
However , time has shown that Brandt was not nearly as pro-Western as thought .
He did eventually become Chancellor of Germany and even won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1971 .
At the same time , his Eastern policies led directly to the acceptance of Russian control of vast areas of conquered territories .
He was finally unseated in 1974 when it was discovered that his personal aide , Gunter Guillaume , was an officer in the German Democratic Republic People 's Army and an espionage agent for the Ministry of State Security ( MfS ) .
Since 1976 Brandt has served as Chairman of Socialist International , a group that has supported both the Sandinista regime of Nicaragua and the left - wing guerrillas in El Salvador .
We could suspect that the propaganda banknote supporting Brandt was produced by the Communist Party in 1957 because they had already recognized him as a possible future ally .
The Communist Party prepared a propaganda note for the election of 1953 .
It was slightly larger than the genuine currency , measuring 165x75 mm .
This note did not unfold , but had the propaganda message on the back in black text on white paper .
Once again it attacked the four years of Adenauer , the parties in power and compared prices between 1949 and 1953 for such items as milk , butter and sauerkraut .
The message ended : Vote the German Communist Party .
Another banknote was designed to bring young Germans to the East where they might be influenced by the glory of Communism .
It is a parody of the German Federal Republic 20 Deutsche mark note of 1948 .
The imitation has been folded so that the outside face and back shows the back of the genuine note ( " Zwanzig Deutsche Mark " ) in green .
The color of the parody is lighter in shade than the genuine note .
When opened , the following propaganda text is found in German : Wo n't you ... —
For 20 German marks , 10 German marks or even only 5 German marks , depending on where you live - ... Spend 14 days on a wonderful vacation ?
... See the best cultural groups of the world singing , dancing and playing ?
... See the German swimming champion Herbert Klein , and the Soviet world champion Meschkow setting new records ?
... Schade and Zatopek running long distance for the victory palm ?
... Be present when Dynamo Moscow is playing against a West European football team ?
... Meet young people from all over the world — from Lapland to South Africa ? ... Watch the world 's best movies ?
... Take part in a magnificent lake party on the Muggel - lake ?
What ?
All this is available for less than 50 German marks ?
Yes , of course .
At the World Festival Games of the Youth and Students for Peace in Berlin .
Everybody can take part !
You only need 5 German marks or 10 German marks — 20 German marks are sufficient for those living very far away .
You only need to pay 50 % of the fare up to the demarcation line .
Afterwards you are our guests and have no further expenses .
Join us in Berlin !
To the World Festival Games of the Youth and Students for Peace .
From 1 until 20 August 1951 .
The remainder of the text is a registration form to be filled out by the finder of the leaflet .
Additional text at the bottom of the message states that Manfred von Brauchitsch is the president of the West German Committee for Preparation of the World Festival Games .
The parody was prepared by " Nolting 's printing office , Hamburg 36 . "
How were these notes disseminated ?
Probably by hand .
However , we do have a newspaper clipping that indicates that at least some were sent through the mail .
An undated 1951 column entitled " Gottingen today " mentions the bank note parody .
The article states : A friendly reader put an invitation on our table which was mailed by the West German Committee for Preparation of the World Festival Games to youngsters and students of the Western Zone .
The Communists behave anti-capitalistic , but the Committee found it appropriate — following the old proverb that ' with bacon you will catch mice ' - to add a capitalistic appearance to the invitation .
The outside imitates two twenty mark notes .
The writer then goes on to sarcastically discuss the text of the leaflet .
He ends :
You see , the Communists understand propaganda .
They clearly know that with the World Festival phrases alone they will not lure many dogs from behind the ovens in West Germany .
That is why they appeared capitalistic under the cover of a twenty mark note , which , as that are famous for any kind of counterfeiting — is not clumsily reproduced .
When I found the propaganda bank note it was accompanied by a number of German newspaper clippings mentioning committee president von Brauchitsch .
I am unable to properly reference the clippings , but we can assume that they were from local West German newspapers published between 1951 and 1953 .
The first clipping is labeled " Mannheim " and tells of von Brauchitsch being elected president of a : Committee for the Unity within German Sports .
He had invited 400 guests to a restaurant to meet various German boxing personalities .
In a prepared speech von Brauchitsch spoke against ' militaristic tendencies within German sports .
The second undated clipping reads : Another arrest .
The former race - driver Manfred von Brauchitsch was arrested for suspicion of high treason .
He is the president of the " Committee for the Unity and Freedom of German Sports / ' an organization controlled by the Soviet occupied zone .
Further research has shown von Brauchitsch was arrested in early 1953 , so this clipping probably dates from about that time .
The final clipping is from the German Press Agency and is labeled " Munich , 8 May " .
It states ; that a lawyer known for defending Communist Party members has taken the case .
It further mentions that the general manager of the sports committee , Martin Hamann , has also been arrested .
Further research has indicated that von Brauchitsch was released 15 May 1953 .
On 30 September 1953 he was again arrested on suspicion of treason .
On 25 March 1954 he was released after giving his word of honor that he would be present at his trial .
Manfred von Brauchitsch immediately crossed the border into the German Democratic Republic where he took up residence in Grafenwarth .
I actually heard from a gentleman in 1991 who had attended the games .
He said : I was there as a 16 - year - old boy and helped the Commies celebrate their festival .
We went by train and boat on the River Spree inside the city of Berlin .
I actually had fun there .
I really cared little about the politics of the festival .
Another early monetary campaign reminds us of today 's computer hackers .
Allegedly , the Kampfgruppe Gegen Unmenschlichkeit ( Fighters against Inhumanity ) based in West Berlin , found a way to break the codes used by the banks of the German Democratic Republic .
The KgU then moved money from one bank to another illegally , causing great confusion in the East German economy .
This was supposed to have been done just prior to the uprising in the DDR in June of 1953 .
It is unknown if the KgU drew upon the funds that were moved or simply used the technique to cause confusion and fear among those that had their savings in the victimized banks .
The KgU has also been charged with counterfeiting coal , food , gasoline and other ration cards of the DDR .
There is one last item of interest that we should discuss .
It is not in the form of a banknote , but it is a Communist leaflet that pictures banknotes on the front in an attempt to catch the attention of the reader .
Since it uses currency as the " hook " we believe it deserves mention .
We are speaking of a German Communist Party leaflet that shows three West German 50 marks Bundesbank notes of 1960 on the front .
The size of the leaflet is 145x200 mm .
Each of the banknotes is shown in the green and brown of the original currency .
In place of the portrait of Chamberlain Urmiller that appears on the genuine notes , West German politicians appear .
At the left of the notes we find the bright red text Vorsicht , Bluten ! ( " Beware , Funny Money ! " ) .
When the leaflet is turned over we find a long German - language attack on the value of the German currency .
The text is all in black , except for paragraph headings which have been highlighted in red .
The propaganda message reads :
Any honest man dislikes counterfeiters - in money as well as in politics .
Warning !
Political counterfeiters are at work !
These are their words : " The German Government stands for effective peace policy through which legal tensions are eliminated and the arms race is halted .
We will cooperate in suggestions concerning control , reduction and elimination of armaments .
We are interested in improving relations with our Eastern neighbors in all areas of economic , political and cultural life . "
This quote is an official Government statement dated December 1966 .
The Communists then go on to tell what they believe to be the true sentiments of the West German Government .
These are the facts : Instead of starting proper relations with the DDR - non-recognition and the claim of sole responsibility for German matters .
Instead of accepting the DDR 's suggestion to reduce the arms budget by 50 % , the offer has been rejected .
Instead of speaking out against the dirty US war in Vietnam , increased support of the American war crimes .
Instead of genuine friendship with Eastern Europe , demand for the return of the borders of 1937 .
Instead of an all - encompassing nuclear weapons ban , attempting to obtain the right to make decisions concerning the use of such weapons .
These nice words of peace , security and understanding are not worth a penny .
They are counterfeit !
HUNGARY
The Communists produced a perfect photographic reproduction of the Hungarian 100,000 B - pengo ( billion pengo ) brown note of 3 June 1946 .
The back of the note bears a pro-Communist message .
Since a " five year plan " is mentioned and compared to 1946 , we might assume that this note was disseminated about 1951 .
Hungary was independent for a brief time after the Second World War .
In 1945 the Smallholders ( non-Communists ) won 245 out of 409 seats .
For the next two years the Smallholders were under constant pressure , some members imprisoned , others forced to leave the country .
In the elections of 1947 the Smallholders polled 14 % , the Social Democrats 15 % , and the Communists 21 % .
In the next two years the same tactics of disgrace and arrest were used against the Social Democrats .
By 1949 the Communists were firmly in command .
Matyas Rakosi , secretary of the Worker 's Party , described how the Communists had entered into coalitions in order to dispose of their partners .
In a speech made on 29 February 1952 , he called the technique of slicing off the other political parties one by one " salami tactics . "
The text of the propaganda bank note is as follows : Remember this ' Money ! '
This was left behind by Horthy fascism .
In 1946:1 month salary = 200 dkg pengo = 1 kg cherries .
The Communists created good money !
Average earnings :
In 1947 :
A conductor 278 forint = 163.5 liter milk = 24 kg sugar
A driver 363 forint = 213.5 liter milk = 31 kg sugar
A skilled worker 466 forint = 274 liter milk - 40 kg sugar Today :
A conductor 501 forint = 334 liter milk = 83.5 kg sugar
A driver 550 forint = 366 liter milk = 91.6 kg sugar
A skilled worker 602 forint = 401 liter milk = 100 kg sugar
The old owners of the BSzKRT deducted tax , old age pension and health insurance from your salary .
Today you do n't have to pay for them !
The five - year economic plan has raised your living standard 150 % in comparison to before the war .
Vote for the five - year economic plans and for peace !
Vote for the MDP , the leaders of the people 's movement !
Some comments on the names and abbreviations used on the note : Admiral Miklos Horthy ( 1868 -1946 ) was the wartime Regent of Hungary from 1920 to 1944 .
The initials " MDP " represent the Hungarian Workers ' Party ( Magyar Dolgozók Pártja ) , the name of their Communist party between 1948 and 1956 .
" BSzKRT " was the Budapest Street Car Corporation .
This company had been privately owned before the war .
It was nationalized by the government after the war and this leaflet is obviously meant to convey to the workers the great strides in salary and benefits that the Communist Party can provide for them .
IRAN
The revolutionary propaganda notes of Iran are both political and religious .
In October 1952 , Iranian Prime Minister Dr. Mohammad Mossadegh declared that Britain was " an enemy , " and cut all diplomatic relations with the United Kingdom .
In November and December 1952 , British intelligence officials suggested to American intelligence that the prime minister should be ousted .
The United States agreed .
The United States and Great Britain wanted to replace him with someone seen as more strongly anti-Communist and a leader that would not nationalize the Iranian oil industry .
They overthrew Mossadegh in 1953 as part of " Operation Ajax . "
Mohammad Reza Pahlavi , the Shah of Iran was put back in power and remained loyal to the West until his overthrow in 1979 .
Although the Shah was good for the West , his own people never forgave the United States or the Shah for overthrowing the legally elected Prime Minister .
The results of that act are still seen today .
During the Shah 's reign , Iranian currency bore his picture .
However , the new Supreme Leader of Iran after the fall of the Shah was the religious leader Grand Ayatollah Ruhollah Musavi Khomeini .
He enforced a more Muslim concept and portraits of the Shah on banknotes were forbidden .
As a result , all the portraits of the Shah on Iranian banknotes were obliterated .
There are hundreds of such obliterations ranging from a simple ink blot to very fancy designs .
The Standard Catalogue of Iranian Banknotes depicts 93 such notes , and there certainly are many more .
I have 16 in my collection and they are just representative of the various types of overprint .
At first , the moderate right wing parties replaced the Shah 's watermark with that of a " Lion and Sun " which still symbolized the Iranian Nationalistic movement .
The Shah 's portrait was removed and replaced with the Imam Reza Mosque .
The religious leaders then demanded that the " Lion and Sun " seal be covered with a black " Islamic Republic " seal .
So , notes exist with the Shah blacked out , the " Lion and Sun " blacked out , or both .
Banknotes also appeared in Iran that depicted Ayatollah Khomeini .
Nobody is sure why they were prepared .
It could have been pro-Royal forces who wanted to insult Khomeini by placing his face as an idol on a banknote .
It could have been pro-Khomeini forces that wanted to show their support for the holy man .
Or , it could have been criminals who attempted to pass the banknotes off as new Iranian currency .
There are two such unofficial Iranian revolutionary currency - like propaganda notes , a brownish - purple 5000 rials , and a multicolored 10,000 rials .
Both depict Khomeini on front and are entitled " Bank Markazi Iran " on back .
Supplies of the notes were allegedly destroyed as the new Islamic Republic currency appeared .
Another interesting political note for Iran was produced by monarchists who desired the end of the revolution and the return of the royal family .
This note is a 500 rials parody of the 200 rials and 500 rials Kingdom of Iran Bank Markazi Iran notes of 1974 - 1979 , with the bust of Crown Prince Reza II replacing that of the Shah on the front .
The designs of the front and back are basically that of the 500 rials note .
However , the back has the stylized view of the Maidane Shahyad monument .
Below the monument on the back is the English - language text " Supporters of the Continuation of Constitutional Monarchy for Iran . "
The parody is green on white paper .
Two versions are known .
The first is as discussed above .
A second exists with " Brighton U.K. " added as a third line of English - language text , and the text and image of Reza Pahlavi shown fuller and with better shading of the face .
IRAQ The United States has produced more propaganda banknotes for Iraq than anywhere else in history .
During Operation Desert Storm in 1990 - 1991 , 16 different propaganda dinar notes were dropped on the enemy .
During Operation Iraqi Freedom
There were no propaganda banknotes , but there was a leaflet coded CPA G0075 that depicted all the new Iraqi currency to help the people recognize counterfeits .
It explained the features that the Iraqi people should look for to be assured that the currency was legitimate and genuine .
We will not depict the war notes above , but we can show one banknote that has been used more recently during the consolidation phase of the Iraq occupation .
3,000 copies of this U.S. leaflet , code number IZ - 06 - HB - 5583 were disseminated in Fallujah and Ramadi as part of the anti-terrorist campaign .
The text on the back is :
To report terrorist activities call :
Ubaydi 619-929 ; Karabalah 652-499 ; Husaybah 653-077 KHALISTAN
The Sikhs have sought independence from India since 1947 , claiming territory from the Jamna River on the east to the border with Pakistan on the west .
Khalistan has been a member of the Unrepresented Nations and Peoples Organization since 1993 ; other members include Kurdistan , Tibet , Taiwan , and Nagaland .
To publicize their demand for independence , Dal Khalsa ( Sikh Empire - named after the Sikh army that operated in 17th and 18th - century Punjab ) , a fringe movement of the Akali Dal , printed propaganda banknotes in 1980 for the Republic of Khalistan advocating the formation of an independent Sikh state in the Indian Punjab .
Akali Dal , a collection of disparate Sikh factions desiring more autonomy for Sikhs in India , does not generally support the separatist Khalistan movement .
Dal Khalsa has active branches in the West .
Their constitution states in part that Dal Khalsa is a social - religious - political organization of the Sikh nation .
The primary goal of the Dal Khalsa is the establishment of self - rule for Sikhs .
The 5 dollar Bank of Khalistan note depicts Jagjit Singh Chauhan , Dal Khalsa leader living in Britain on the front and the Golden Temple at Amritsar , spiritual center for the Sikhs on the back .
The note was issued as a donation receipt by a group of Sikhs living in British Columbia , Canada .
The 10 dollar Bank of Khalistan depicts a vignette of the Amritsar Golden Temple on front and Baba Banda Singh Bahadur on the back .
The Amritsar Temple made headlines all over the world in June 1984 when Indian Prime Minister Indira Gandhi ordered her armed forces to attack the temple under " Operation Blue Star " to drive out Sikh militants .
The attack was a success , but a political disaster for Gandhi .
It caused an uproar among Sikhs all over the world .
The Sikhs were among the most loyal members of the Indian Army and Gandhi used them as her personal bodyguard .
After the desecration of the shrine her Sikhs took the ultimate revenge , assassinating the prime minister .
The note was issued as a donation receipt by a group of Sikhs living in British Columbia , Canada .
There is also a 50 dollar Bank of Khalistan red note , depicting Sant Jarnail Singh Bhindranwale on front .
The back features the Sri Takhat Sahib ( Throne of the Immortal ) at left and General Shubeg Singe on back right ( he trained Sikh militants and was killed in Operation Blue Star ) .
This seems to be the rarest of all the issues , only one known at present .
It was apparently printed much later than the first two notes , and probably not in Canada .
A Green Khalistan $ 100 dollar note appeared on the market in 2008 .
It is believed to have been printed in Germany .
The front left depicts the Akal Takht ( The Seat of the Timeless One ) in the Golden Temple complex in Amritsar , Punjab .
The front right depicts Sant Jarnail Singh Ji Khalsa Bhindranwale .
He supported the proposed Sikhism - based theocratic state of Khalistan .
Along with a group of activists he occupied the Akal Takht complex in the Golden Temple of Amritsar and was martyred by the Indian Army during their counter attack ( Operation Blue Star ) on 6 June 1984 .
Text at the lower center of the note is : Chairman , Dal Khalsa International Republic of Khalistan
The back of the note depicts a Sikh symbol at the left .
The back right depicts Sirdar Kapur Singh ( 1909 - 1986 ) , a Former Member of the Indian Parliament , intellectual and author of articles on the religious - cultural historical aspects of Sikh culture .
The text at the bottom of the note is Bank of Khalistan
The owner of one such note told me that several years ago a number of Sikhs appeared in Lahore , Pakistan at a time that the Khalistan movement was in the news .
They distributed the banknotes in the markets and public places more as a political leaflet than a banknote or receipt for donation .
Most were thrown away by the local people but a few were saved by collectors .
Most of the text on the first series of notes printed in Canada is in English , with some parallel notations in French and Hindi .
The French notations were removed in the later notes .
Data on the 50 dollar banknote is courtesy of Anil R. Bohora , " Banknotes of Khalistan - Scrip of the Indian Punjab Independence Movement , " IBNS Journal , Vol. 50 , No. 1 , 2011 .
KOSOVO
In 1989 , a nationalist leader by the name of Slobodan Milosevic took power in the Serbian Republic .
He had previously served as the leader of Belgrade Communist Party and the Serbian Communist Party .
He decided upon the ethnic cleansing of his country and the creation of a Greater Serbia .
He abolished Kosovo 's autonomy .
There were daily news reports of murders , rapes , mass killings and other atrocities carried out by the Serbs as Milosevic drove the minorities from their lands and homes , " purifying " Serbia .
Croatia and Slovenia declared their independence from the Yugoslav Federated Republic .
In Croatia , ethnic Serbs and Croats begin a long , bloody conflict .
The West recognized Bosnia - Herzegovina as an independent state .
The UN imposed sanctions on Yugoslavia .
There were new reports of " ethnic cleansing , " a policy of slaughtering Muslim inhabitants of towns or driving them away in order to create an ethnically pure region .
There were reports of concentration camps and mass rapes .
Milosevic 's actions forced the United Nations to deploy peacekeeping forces and begin humanitarian relief operations .
Operation Provide Promise began on 2 July 1992 .
Twenty - one nations formed a coalition to supply war - torn Sarajevo with food and medicine .
The U.N. established " no- fly " zones over Bosnia .
The United States mediated an agreement between the Bosnians , the Bosnian Croats , and the Government of Croatia to form a federation of Bosnians and Croats .
This temporarily ended the fighting .
In early 1999 , the Serbs again seemed intent on purifying their lands of all foreign ethnic groups .
Television reports told of thousands of ethnic Albanians persecuted , raped , or murdered .
This time the North Atlantic Treaty Organization ( NATO ) took action .
NATO demanded full compliance with UN Resolution 1199 of 23 September 1998 .
The resolution called for all parties to cease hostilities .
At a meeting held 15 March 1999 , the Kosovar separatists agreed to a cease - fire , but the government of Yugoslav President Slobodan Milosevic refused .
NATO warned that refusal to cease hostilities against the Kosovar civilians would lead directly to military force .
After a week of Serbian refusals , the 19 - member organization unanimously agreed to initiate air strikes .
The first occurred at 1400 on 24 March 1999 .
NATO aircraft pounded military and political targets within Serbia as part of " Operation Allied Force . "
Fighter aircraft later attacked Serb military forces in Kosovo .
The Kosovo Liberation Army ( KLA ) overprinted National Bank of Macedonia notes of 1992 .
The overprints are in black .
On the front , at left top is " Pristina , 1 April 1999 " ; at left center is the two - headed eagle of the Kosovo coat of arms ; at right top is " The Provisional Bank of the Republic of Kosovo " ; and at right bottom is the denomination and " DINARË . "
The banknotes were prepared by the KLA as propaganda for Kosovo 's independence .
The notes exist in six denominations ; 10,25 , 50 , 100 , 500 and 100 dinare .
At the end of the war a great number of Serbian military leaders escaped punishment .
The United States wanted to place them on trial for their actions and thus produced a number of reward leaflets in the form of banknotes .
The first is in United States reward leaflet for Radovan Karadzic , in the form of a parody of the Bosnia 50 Federal Convertible Maraka note of 1998 .
The front of the note is replaced by the reward notice , which shows a photograph of Radovan Karadzic at left , along with Bosnian text that says in part : Program Rewards for Justice offers up to $ 5,000,000 .
Program Rewards for Justice offers up to five million dollars for any information leading to the arrest and conviction of persons who have been accused by the International Tribunal for War Crimes in The Hague for violation of international law , including Radovan Karadzic .
If you possess any information , we ask that you please call Rewards for Justice on the telephone numbers or on the email address shown below .
All your connections will be treated as confidential ... / CALL NOW !
The text is printed on a black background in orange and white .
The email address is in English .
The back of the leaflet is a faithful reproduction of the back of the genuine Bosnian note .
Karadzic was indicted for genocide during the siege of Sarajevo and the 1995 Srebrenica massacre .
The United States also produced a series of wanted leaflets in the form of an enlarged replica of a $ 50 United States Federal Reserve Note , Series 1996 with the right half overlain with a poster .
Back has the address of " REWARDS FOR JUSTICE " in English , and at lower right a seal of the Department of State Diplomatic Security Service .
The text offers up to $ 5 million for information leading to the apprehension of the individuals .
The leaflets are designed so that , when folded twice vertically , the front and back of the packet show the left half of the enlarged $ 50 note .
The above reward for Balkan war criminals Slobodan Milosevic , Radovan Karadzic , and Ratko Mladic was printed in three languages ; English , Serbo - Croatian and Cyrillic .
Other banknote leaflets in the same $ 50 format offer rewards for ; Abdelmajid Dahoumane , an Algerian national indicted for international terrorism and placing a bomb near a terminal in the state of Washington in December 1999 , Lya Jamel , indicted for bombing ALAS Chiricanas flight 901 on 19 July 1994 , and a reward for terrorists who committed or aided in the attack on the USS Cole in the harbor of Aden on 12 October 2000 .
There is one more banknote leaflet that probably should be depicted in this section that mentions Serbia , Kosovo and Bosnia .
Because of the ethnic hatred among the various people of the old Yugoslavia , free trade and commerce became a problem that economically hurt everyone .
As a result , the United States Army produced a propaganda leaflet for Bosnia , modeled on the Yugoslavia 20 Novih Dinara note of 1994 , showing the poet Djuro Jaksic ( 1832 -1878 ) at left on the front .
In the leaflet , there is an appeal in behalf of free markets covering the right portion of the front of the note : In Business ...
More customers equal more sales for suppliers and more competition equals lower cost for consumers .
How can you influence the market ?
Encourage Freedom of Movement .
It makes economic sense .
The back of the leaflet shows a map of Bosnia overlain with a picture of a child driving a small pedal car , with the text : Freedom of Movement - everyone wins .
These notes were produced by the United States Army , and distributed to U.S. troops in Bosnia for dissemination .
POLAND
The Solidarity Movement I am not sure that we should add Solidarity banknotes to this article because there is some question as to whether or not they fall into the Cold War category .
Yet , it was a national movement to overthrow the Communist rule of Poland so I think we can make a case for the addition .
Between 1981 and 1989 , the Polish Solidarity Union issued numerous fund - raising stamp - like labels and leaflets in the form of Polish or foreign banknotes .
The leaflets were meant to be sold as donations to the Solidarity underground movement , mostly to finance underground printers .
These leaflets were illegal in Poland during the communist regime .
In June 1989 , in the first legal election in Poland in modern times , Solidarity came to power .
Anatol Kobylinski describes the movement in Six Years of the Underground Post in Poland : Martial law was declared in Poland on 13 December 1981 .
A direct consequence was the de-legalization by the authorities of the independent self - governing Trade Union Solidarnosc .
However , contrary to the government 's intentions , this mass movement which had been born during the heroic strike in the Lenin Shipyard in Gdansk in 1980 , was not crushed .
In fact , this declaration of war by a military junta against the people only forced Solidarnosc , in common with other opposition groups , to work underground .
New structures were rapidly set up and returned to visibility through a network of clandestine publications , both books and periodicals .
The biggest problem facing the author is what to depict .
I have eight computer pages single - spaced of Solidarity banknotes , the total number being 69 items .
Some Polish literature states that there could be as many as 100 of the banknotes .
In addition , Solidarity propaganda overprints were placed on at least 43 genuine banknotes .
Lech Walesa was the spokesman for Solidarity and appeared on many of the leaflet banknotes .
In the Solidarity 200 zlotych Narodowy Bank Polski Propaganda Banknote he is depicted in place of Polish revolutionary , nationalist , and General , Jarosław Dabrowski .
Some of the propaganda slogans on the genuine banknotes are ; " Boycott is victory , " " Strength by unity , " " Overcome your fear , do not vote , " and " Solidarity lives . "
SOMALIA
In 1960 , the Somali Democratic Republic was formed through merger of the British colony of British Somaliland and the Italian - administered UN trust territory of Italian Somaliland .
The republic 's seat of government is its principal city , Mogadishu , which lies on the coast in the southern part of the country .
From the start , the new country was plagued by regional clan - based rivalries .
As early as 1961 , citizens of northern Somalia were in revolt against the newly formed republic , and were seeking an end to southern domination of the north .
In 1969 Major General Mohamed Siad Barre took control in a bloodless coup and declared a Marxist state with close ties to the USSR .
With some 45 competing clan - based groups , Somalia 's political situation became extremely fluid and complex .
The Somali National Movement ( SNM ) , the most influential of many factional groups , was based in London for several years , and then relocated to Ethiopia in 1982 .
In 1988 the SNM captured and held several cities in the northwest .
In 1990 , a peaceful anti-government movement begun by the United Somali Congress erupted into a bloody civil war that resulted in the ouster of President Barre in early 1991 .
During the 1990's , six major factions , sometimes in fluid and temporary alliances , controlled most of Somalia : The SNM , the Somali Salvation Democratic Front , the Aideed faction of the United Somali Congress ( leader until his death in August 1996 : General Mohammed Farah Aideed ) , the Ali Mahdi faction of the United Somali Congress ( later the Somali Salvation Alliance ; leader , Ali Mahdi Muhammad ) , the Somali National Front , and the Somali Patriotic Movement .
Following the United Nations withdrawal , in June 1995 , Aideed , who controlled the southern half of Mogadishu , declared himself president of Somalia .
The Mahdi faction produced their own banknotes that appear quite similar to those of the official Central Bank of Somalia shilin currency , but are denominated in " N - shilin " ( North shillings ) .
Naturally enough , Aideed did not recognize these notes .
The notes are multicolored , and bear the notation " Muqdisho 1991 " at the bottom front .
Two banknotes are known from the Mahdi faction , a N20 shilin with the front showing a man leading a camel and the back showing a harvest scene with five female workers and a N50 shilin note with the front showing a boy at a loom and the back depicting banana trees and a young person leading a donkey bearing three children .
In the south of Somalia the Republic of Somaliland produced its own Baanka Somaliland currency banknotes .
They were printed in Britain for the Mohamed Haji Ibrahim Egal faction , politically close to the United Somali Congress and warlord Mohammed Farah Aideed .
All are denominated in Somaliland shillings , and are known in denominations of 5 , 10 , 20 , 50 , 100 and 500 shillings .
THE SOVIET UNION
The DDR 20 mark banknote was not the only one parodied by the NTS .
They also prepared an imitation of the Russian 25 Ruble note of 1947 .
We should mention here that Russian propaganda leaflet messages tend to be very long and tedious .
The Russian never learned that sometimes less is more .
The NTS leaflets followed that same formula and for the most part they are long , boring , and seldom display images or colors .
The 25 ruble parody was photographically reproduced and thus is an excellent match .
The colors are a duller green and lack the brightness and crispness of the genuine .
Also , the printing is somewhat fuzzy and does not have the sharpness of the original note .
There is only one type of 25 Ruble propaganda banknote known and this bears the title in Russian on the back " Soldier !
Sergeant !
Officer !
Brothers and Comrades ! "
The message is extremely long .
As we mentioned above , the Soviet propagandists never learned the technique of short hard - hitting messages to capture the imagination of the reader .
Most NTS literature reads like Russian tragedy .
Some of the highlights of the text are :
You have taken this paper into your hand .
No , this is not money but the word of truth .
Is it not more valuable than money ?
What value is the ruble in a country where the Kremlin bloodsuckers have turned it into the poorest place on earth ?
There are not another people in the West that lives any poorer than we do .
What does it mean ?
The word of truth is valuable .
And here it is : the fateful and revolutionary hour is approaching .
The great enemy of all times and people - Stalin - is ready to plunge you and the country into a carnage of a new and terrible war , a war which no one in the world wants , except he , Stalin .
This hunk of humanity in the form of a Generalissimo is mad and is looking insatiably for power at any price , including your blood .
The long message goes on to ask that groups be formed , defection be considered , the pitchfork symbol and the initials " NTS " be painted on walls and finally ends with the statement :
For a free revolution !
For an honest government on our own land !
For a free Russia !
Death to all tyrants !
To all workers freedom !
NTS .
The NTS also produced propaganda parodies of the Russian 100 Ruble note of 1947 .
There are at least four types prepared from 1953 to 1957 .
The titles of the four notes are : Drouzia !
Moriaki ! ( Friends ! Seamen ! ) , K Naseleniov Strany ( To the Citizens of the Land ) , Brat !
Droug !
( Brother ! Friend ! ) and Tovarisch ( Comrade ) .
Inspecting the propaganda banknotes , we find once again that they closely match the genuine currency , with only the dullness of the colors and the lack in sharpness of the image to point them out .
The messages are extremely long and the logic convoluted .
If anything , these banknotes leaflets are longer and duller than the 25 ruble leaflets .
Once again I will translate some selected text that gives a general impression of the content of the messages .
From the 100 Ruble note entitled " To the citizens of the Land , " we translate the first paragraph :
There was never a single revolution in the world that promised so much and gave so little to the people as the October Revolution .
Forty years of one 's lifetime is a long enough period .
During this period we were able to learn a lot about the workings of the Communist Regime , allowing for mistakes ascribed to lack of experience and postwar destructions .
The Party leaders refer to the present day living as the highest form of democracy .
But we the people have our own views about the October Revolution .
For forty years rivers of blood were flowing , millions of lives torn away and destroyed .
The Kronstat uprising , the opposition of the Kolchoz idea , the uprising in the camps Varkutee , Norelska , Karagandee in 1953 - 55 , the opposition of our intelligentsia to the political idea of suppression , the deep dissatisfaction of workers of low income , the dissatisfaction of the youth , all of this sufficiently proves the lack of trust that exists in all categories of society toward Communism .
It is interesting that although the note has " 1954 " written on it by the NTS agent who distributed it , the mention of " forty years " and the fact that the revolt in Karagandee occurred as late as 1955 indicates that this note was probably produced about 1957 .
The message on the note entitled " Comrade " is interesting because it allows us to accurately date the time of printing .
One line of text states : Enough !
36 years is long enough to convince one that the path of the party and the government is the path toward ruin and catastrophe !
Since we know that the Russian Revolution occurred in 1917 , we can add the 36 years and find that the message was written in 1953 .
The message ends with :
The NTS summons you to join the struggle !
Follow the instructions of the revolutionary staff NTS , F - 5303 .
We surmise that the " 5303 " pins the date down to March of 1953 .
The messages on the other 100 Ruble notes are similar in tone and need not be translated in length .
We should mention that the date " 1953 " does appear on the leaflet " Brother ! Friend ! "
The leaflet " Friends ! Sailors ! " uses the term " 36 years " in two paragraphs so it was probably also produced in 1953 .
Were there any other NTS propaganda currency leaflets ?
None have ever come to light or been offered at auction , but there are literary accounts of an additional piece in the Eastern European numismatic press .
In the 1981 Yearbook of the Paper Money and Securities Study Circle , there is an article entitled " Paper Money as a Paper Weapon of the Counter - Revolution . "
This article , written in the German Democratic Republic by Dr. Julius Mader , mentions an alleged NTS production of a Russian 10 Ruble propaganda note .
Dr. Mader says that a balloon with a defective release mechanism actually floated all the way to the outskirts of Moscow .
This balloon is said to have been loaded with 300 Kilograms of 10 Ruble notes .
However , Mader does not mention the NTS 100 Ruble propaganda banknote in any of his further comments .
How did the Communists react to all of the NTS propaganda ?
They were not happy about it .
In Louis Hagen 's The Secret War For Europe , Stein and Day , NY , 1969 , some of the Russian reactions are detailed : In April 1954 the Berlin NTS leader Dr. Alexander Trushnovich was kidnapped .
Nine days later an attempt was made to assassinate another NTS leader Georgi Okolovich .
On June 20th of the same year , Valeri Tremmel , an Austrian NTS leader was drugged and kidnapped .
The book goes on to mention dozens of such cases .
Open season was declared on the entire hierarchy of the NTS .
The Russians were not amused !
Did any other anti-Communist groups use money as a form of propaganda ?
The Anti-Bolshevik Bloc of Nations ( ABN ) , a group formed in the Ukraine in 1943 and other liberation movements such as the Ukrainian Insurgent Army ( UPA ) , the Organization of Ukrainian Nationalists ( OUN ) , and the Ukrainian Supreme Liberation Council ( UHVR ) produced a number of currency - like pieces between the years 1946 and 1949 .
However , these have been called " bons " in the past and it is probable that they were meant to be used as receipts for contributions rather than currency .
Some are thought to have been used as a medium of exchange , but since the notes were not actually intended to be currency I believe we can omit them from this article .
THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA
There have been numerous propaganda banknotes attacking the United States from Soviet - bloc nations , Independent communist nations and Third World Countries .
I will just depict a few of the more interesting ones in this section .
The Chinese Communists prepared a banknote for use against the United States .
It is a propaganda parody of United States $ 50 Federal Reserve Note of 1963 , with overprints in Chinese on front and back .
The text on the front is :
The great inflationary American dollar
The message on the back is : Support the Black American 's struggle .
Support the people of Vietnam against the Americans in their struggle to free their country .
Crush the American Imperialists in their exploitation of Hong Kong as a center for their espionage operation .
Crush the American Empire and its principles .
Long live our great leader Mao Tse -tung .
I am going to be honest here and admit that the above note is not really propaganda in the true sense of the word .
However , the atomic bomb was the most powerful weapon ever conceived by man in the late 1940s and America was willing to remind the world that it was the only nation with that bomb .
It was the " Big Stick " and America was willing to wave it .
The United States did countless tests of its super weapon , and in one operation the units involved prepared souvenir currency to commemorate their effort .
Between 1946 and 1958 , twenty - three nuclear devices were detonated at Bikini Atoll in the Marshall Islands in the Pacific Ocean .
The March 1954 detonation was the first test of the hydrogen bomb .
The program was named Operation Crossroads .
The support fleet consisted of more than 150 ships that supported the 42,000 men of Joint Task Force One .
Several different souvenir " short snorters " were printed in conjunction with Operation Crossroads .
The note above has different symbols and numbers that all represent part of Operation Crossroads .
For instance , the atomic bomb blast is depicted in the center , while " Joint Task Force One " is at the top .
At the left are " 58 " and " 509 . "
The 58th Wing Photo Unit supported all organizations during the tests .
The 509th Composite Group dropped the bomb on the ships moored in Bikini Atoll .
The back of the note has " Task Group One .
Five , " the Army Air Group that comprised of all Army Air Force Units assigned to the Crossroads mission .
The back depicts a B - 29 and the name of the islands " Bikini " and " Kwajalein . "
A second note from this series depicts a ship on the front and the back and the text " USA and USN Atomic Short Snorter . "
Normally , a short snorter is a banknote that had been autographed , and as the service member moved to a new location he attached more banknotes that were also signed by his new unit members .
Sometimes a short snorter roll can be several feet long .
It was originally thought that these Bikini banknotes were just souvenirs of the operation , but one naval veteran has stated that the short snorter notes were good for any drink in local bars whenever you could get someone to sign his name on it .
HONG KONG
Although its ownership has now reverted to the People 's Republic of China , during the Cold War years the city of Hong Kong was a British Crown Colony .

Armed with a map depicting a 10,000 - year - old landscape submerged beneath the North Sea and fresh evidence from nearby sites , archaeologists are realizing that early humans were more territorial than was previously thought .
Laura Spinney reports .
E. CH'NG / UNIV .
WOLVERHAMPTON
Pilgrim Lockwood , the skipper of a British fishing trawler named Colinda , was n’t quite sure what to make of the thing his nets had scraped up from the bottom of the North Sea .
Just over 21 centimetres long , it was made of antler with a set of barbs running along one side .
Back on land , Lockwood gave the artefact to the ship ’s owner , and it eventually made its way to a museum in Norwich , UK .
It turned out to be a prehistoric harpoon point dating to the Mesolithic period , between about 4,000 and 10,000 years ago .
A sketch of the Mesolithic harpoon point found in the North Sea by the Colinda in 1931 .
M. BURKITT & G. NORRIE
That was 1931 , and archaeologists studying the artefact , which became known as the Colinda point , began to realize that hunter - gatherers would once have roamed across a vast plain that connected Britain to the rest of Europe .
But they had no idea what the plain looked like or what life would have been like for the harpoon ’s makers .
Now researchers have drawn the first map of that lost world , sketching out a 10,000 - year - old landscape filled with marshes , rivers and lakes .
It turns out that the region they call Doggerland may have been a sort of paradise for Mesolithic people .
Because the archaeological evidence from the period is thin , Mesolithic people have in the past been depicted by researchers as restless nomads and Doggerland as a land bridge through which they passed without leaving a trace .
The new map suggests that , on the contrary , Doggerland would have been an ideal environment for them to linger in — until sea levels , rising since the end of the last ice age , finally inundated it , turning Britain into an island about 8,000 years ago .
Along with other new discoveries in Britain and continental Europe , the research is helping to fill in crucial gaps in the current knowledge about Mesolithic life .
“ Doggerland is key to understanding the Mesolithic in northern Europe , ” says Vince Gaffney , a landscape archaeologist at the University of Birmingham , UK .
Click for larger image
Along with his colleagues Simon Fitch and the late Ken Thomson , Gaffney established the mapping project to outline the terrain of Doggerland , named after the sandbank and shipping hazard of the Dogger Bank ( see ‘ Mesolithic sites around the North Sea ’ ) .
They managed to borrow seismic survey data , which outline sediment layers below the seabed , from the Norwegian oil company Petroleum Geo-Services .
The researchers then put their powerful computers to work to reconstruct Doggerland in three dimensions .
In a pilot project beginning in 2002 , the researchers reconstructed 6,000 square metres of the ancient landscape — slightly larger than a football field .
There , about 10 metres beneath the modern seabed , they discovered the course of a major ancient river , almost as big as today ’s Rhine .
They named it the Shotton River , after Birmingham geologist Fred Shotton who , among other things , was dropped behind enemy lines to map the geology of the Normandy beaches before the D - Day landings .
Now confident that the reconstruction would work , the researchers expanded the project .
The result is a 23,000 - square - kilometre map of a part of Doggerland — an area the size of Wales — that they hope eventually to extend northward as well as eastward , towards the Netherlands1 .
Archaeologists are excited about the map for several reasons .
First , with an idea of how the terrain undulated , they can work out how , and how quickly , it was submerged .
It is thought that the sea level rose no faster than about one or two metres per century , and that the land would have disappeared in a series of punctuated inundations .
“ It was perfectly noticeable in a generation , ” says marine archaeologist Nic Flemming , a research fellow at the National Oceanography Centre of University of Southampton , UK .
“ But nobody had to run for the hills . ”
Second , researchers can now start to predict how Mesolithic people might have used the terrain .
But it wo n’t be easy .
Working with divers and remotely operated vehicles is complex and expensive , and the new map is n’t detailed enough for underwater excavation purposes : the smallest detectable feature on it is about 10 metres high and 25 metres wide .
“ Doggerland is key to understanding the Mesolithic in northern Europe . ” Vince Gaffney
To get a more detailed picture of what Doggerland might have looked like , computer specialist Eugene Ch’ng of the University of Wolverhampton , UK , is building a virtual - reality simulation .
Starting with a 27 - kilometre stretch of the Shotton River , he has recreated a Stone Age settlement by the water ’s edge , at the confluence of two rivers , complete with thatched huts and racks for drying fish and tanning hides2 .
The virtual vegetation is faithful to the palaeobotanical record , right down to the stinging nettles .
There are fish in the rivers , birds in the air and boar in the woods — although for now these are just avatars rather than accurate biological models .
The only thing that is missing is the people , but Ch’ng will add them soon .
He is constantly feeding new data into the simulation , and his ultimate goal is to turn the virtual reality into augmented reality , in which archaeologists need only don a headset to enter the Mesolithic landscape .
Found artefacts find meaning
The most immediate way in which the map will be useful , however , is in giving context to marine archaeological finds .
For more than a century , fishing boats — particularly Dutch beam trawlers , whose nets scrape the seabed — have been scooping prehistoric material out of the North Sea .
Most of it dates from the Palaeolithic , the vast era that ended around 10,000 years ago , and includes the bones of woolly mammoths and reindeer from the last ice age .
But there is also some more recent , Mesolithic material .
Until now , archaeologists have n’t been sure how to interpret these scattered remains .
But with the Doggerland map , “ we ’ll be able to position the archaeological finds within that landscape to understand their meaning , ” says Hans Peeters of the National Service for Archaeology , Cultural Landscape and Built Heritage in Amersfoort , the Netherlands .
Jan Glimmerveen , a Dutch amateur archaeologist , has over the past decade collected around 100 Mesolithic artefacts , which he gets from fishermen trawling the southern North Sea .
The material includes an adze - or axe - like tool made from an antler , with part of the wooden shaft preserved , and a tool made from the bone of an aurochs , a large type of extinct cattle .
Some of the artefacts have been radiocarbon dated to between 10,000 and 8,100 years ago , and all come from a small area just off the southern edge of the Birmingham map of Doggerland .
The Dutch call it ‘ De Stekels ’ ( ‘ The Spines ’ ) because there are steep dunes that were probably once close to a river .
Although the artefacts were lying loose on the seabed , Glimmerveen is convinced there was a Mesolithic settlement on or close to those dunes , and Peeters agrees .
“ You can look at it in a similar way to ploughed fields , ” he says .
“ Objects may have been displaced , but not over very large areas . ”

H. WILDSCHUT
Dutch researchers have a unique opportunity to retrieve Mesolithic material that was once underwater but now is part of reclaimed land .
Peeters , for instance , works in a region of the central Netherlands , the Flevoland polders , that was reclaimed from an inland sea in the mid-twentieth century .
In the early Mesolithic period , this area would have been tidal wetlands .
Later it became a peat marsh , and the ancient bog has yielded a wealth of objects , including pottery and flint tools , that he thinks were deposited as a ritualized reference to lost ancestral lands3 .
Back on the British side , archaeologists are extracting Mesolithic information from a submerged site known as Bouldnor Cliff in the Solent , the stretch of water separating the Isle of Wight from mainland Britain .
As sea levels rose , swelling rivers deposited sediments over a Mesolithic valley .
When the Solent began to form around 5,000 years ago , it eroded first the sediments and then the original valley floor .
That erosion is continuing today , and near the Isle of Wight ’s shore , it is uncovering signs of Mesolithic human activity .
A few scattered flints emerged first , followed by the remains of what could be a wooden dwelling and then , last summer , tools , wood chippings and part of a log boat .
“ In general the preservation is immaculate , ” says Garry Momber , director of the Hampshire and Wight Maritime Trust for Maritime Archaeology in Southampton , who is overseeing the project .
He believes Bouldnor Cliff may have been a boat - building site , which is significant because it was far from the coast and so the boats would have been used only on a local lake .
“ We ’re finding evidence of sedentism , ” he says .
“ These people would have been living and working the land , maybe to a greater extent than we understand now . ”
Nomads settle down
Attachment to the land , ritual practices and sedentism are usually associated with later , Neolithic people .
The boundary between the Mesolithic and Neolithic periods is defined as when farming begins to be practised in an area , and it generally dates to between 4,000 and 6,000 years ago in northern Europe .
The stereotype of Mesolithic people is as “ surviving in this harsh wilderness ” , says Peeters .
“ It was only with the introduction of farming that this poor and risky way of life was gradually brought to an end . ”
This view , he thinks , short - changes Mesolithic people and the imaginative ways they may have used the landscape , both in life and in burial practices ( see ‘ Death in the Mesolithic ’ ) .
Evidence supporting this more complex view of Mesolithic life comes from Téviec and Hoëdic , two Mesolithic burial sites on the coast of Brittany , France .
Here , archaeologist Rick Schulting of the University of Oxford , UK , has analysed stable isotopes — mainly carbon and nitrogen — in human bones to get an idea of what the locals ate .
Téviec and Hoëdic are only 30 kilometres apart , a trivial distance for hunter - gatherers , and yet Schulting has found consistent differences in the bone isotopes between the two sites .
He thinks these reflect differences in their diet : residents of Hoëdic , for instance , seem to have got a lot more of their protein from marine resources than those in Téviec .
“ That suggests to me that these people were quite embedded into the landscape over the long term , ” says Schulting .
“ They were n’t moving around on a great scale . ”
“ These people were quite embedded into the landscape . ” Rick Schulting
A similar picture is emerging from Britain .
In 2000 , a team led by Clive Waddington of Archaeological Research Services , in Derbyshire , UK , began excavating a Mesolithic hut at Howick in northeast England .
By combining radiocarbon dating with analysis of the soil strata , they were able to determine that three huts had been built at the site , each on the ruins of the previous one .
Together , the huts were inhabited over about 150 years .
That occupation was n’t necessarily continuous , Waddington says ; nevertheless , over three or four generations people kept returning to that place .
To him , this suggests that Mesolithic people may have been staking out their group ’s territory .
“ Not that hunter - gatherers usually have any sense of ownership , ” he says .
“ But what they do have is a very strong sense of rights of access to land . ”
Waddington argues , in fact , that the drowning of Doggerland led directly to the development of sedentism and territoriality4 .
Although the idea is speculative , it fits with the growing body of evidence for Mesolithic life in and around Doggerland .
Land would have become an increasingly precious resource as the sea rose .
All these sites , taken together , may illuminate how Doggerland ’s residents adapted to the changing landscape .
But when and how did those changes begin ?
The Birmingham map offers a possible clue in the shape of a giant basin called the Outer Silver Pit , which stretches for up to 100 kilometres through Doggerland .
Fed by an inlet to the east , the pit would at one time have been a lake .
But two sandbanks running almost its full length could only have been formed by fierce currents .
Gaffney speculates that , as the sea rose , the peaceful lake became a fast - flowing estuary into which only the most foolhardy fisherman dared launch his canoe .
So what started as an attraction for water - loving people might eventually have driven them away , triggering the migration whose long - range effects Waddington is seeing at Howick .
Exact details of this upheaval will be hard to prove , not least because most of Doggerland remains uncharted .
Still , archaeologists are in little doubt that such turbulent environmental change required an equally dramatic human response .
In just a few thousand years , Doggerland was transformed from a harsh tundra into a fertile paradise , and eventually into the northern European landscape that we know today .
“ It put human adaptability to the test , ” says Gaffney .
Laura Spinney is a freelance writer in London and Paris .
Casey Luskin insists the Discovery Institute is a secular think tank .
And he says it with a straight face .
What is it about the spreading of pseudo - science that makes reasonable people cringe and gag ?
One characteristic is surely the introduction of religious / political thinking into discussions of fact .
The natural world simply is .
If it upsets our human sensibilities , too freaking bad for us .
When a bull shark bites a potential food item ( a human leg , perhaps ) , it is being neither good nor evil ; it ’s simply hungry and inquisitive .
It ’s nothing personal .
Thus , describing the natural world is best accomplished through observations of what is , not through contemplation of how things should be .
Blaming Darwinism for the Holocaust , communism , capitalism , rock ‘n roll music , abortion , racism , moral relativism , and the general decay of Western society is irrelevant to the scientific question of whether or not evolution by natural selection is a valid explanation for observed evolutionary change on planet Earth .
What is and what ought to be are two distinct questions .
But throw a rock at the Discovery Institute and you ’re more likely to hit a lobbyist or a lawyer than an actual scientist .
For example , Casey Luskin , an attorney with the DI , blogs to his fellow intelligent designers about the “ it ’s just a theory ” argument .
Darwinists love to bash Darwin - skeptics who call evolution “ just a theory , not a fact . ”
The truth is that I rarely , if ever , hear people who are closely involved with the ID movement using this line to oppose evolution .
The “ evolution is just a theory , not a fact ” phrase tends to come from the vox populi— intelligent people who studied this issue in their biology class or perhaps have read books like Darwin ’s Black Box , Icons of Evolution , or Darwin on Trial , but otherwise do n’t follow the issue very closely .
But most creationists do use the argument , endlessly .
They also use the “ intelligent designer ” and “ irreducible complexity ” arguments .
The fact is that intelligent design creationists are a small minority .
Polls indicate that most American creationists are of the Old Earth variety .
And I think the Discovery Institute knows this full well .
Is n’t it really all about talking points , ones the DI can easily disseminate , and ones the general public can easily digest and regurgitate , regardless of the scientific facts ?
Casey Luskins also lists his scientific qualifications :
Having taken over a dozen courses covering evolutionary biology at both the undergraduate and graduate levels , I ’m a scientific skeptic of neo -Darwinism .
Fine , be a skeptic , Luskin .
But are you as skeptical about intelligent design ?
Have you taken a dozen courses covering intelligent design at the undergraduate and graduate level ?
No , because intelligent design is n’t a science , and it can be pretty well summed up in a single 15 minute lecture .
ID is a vague conclusion , not an explanation .
The only thing propping it up is a propaganda machine .
And all the whining in the world about “ morals ” , “ culture ” , and “ academic freedom ” is n’t going to polish the ID turd .
The Discovery Institute calls itself the “ Center for Science and Culture ” .
But it really should choose one or the other , “ science ” or “ culture ” , not both .
Let “ ought ” and “ is ” be distinct ; life works so much better when our desires do n’t cloud our judgment of reality .

EDF nuclear budget for UK is £ 25bn
French energy giant EDF is planning to invest at least £ 25bn in nuclear energy in Britain over the next nine years .
Chain reaction : EDF is said to have earmarked £ 10 bn for four new reactors .
Financial Mail understands that EDF , which is favourite to buy nuclear energy generator British Energy , has earmarked £ 10 bn to build four new reactors .
And it plans to spend a further £ 4bn to £ 5bn on maintaining and renewing ageing reactors at the eight nuclear sites owned by British Energy .
This massive investment comes on top of the estimated £ 11bn that EDF is believed to have offered for British Energy .
British Energy spends about £ 300 m a year maintaining its plants , but EDF is expected to commit to increasing that total significantly because the plants are becoming increasingly unreliable .
British Energy was forced to shut down two nuclear plants last week because of technical problems .
EDF 's more modern reactorsin France have a far better reputation for reliability .
EDF executives , led by Vincent de Rivaz , are confident that they will be given preferred bidder status for British Energy .
Comments by Gordon Brown that he would like to see an enlarged nuclear industry are believed to be subtle digs at British Energy to get on with choosing a buyer .
Brown is becoming increasingly concerned about relentless price increases caused by the decline in oil and gas production .
He believes the nuclear industry could become the main driver in providing cheaper fuel .
The Government , which owns a 35 % stake in British Energy , can look forward to a £ 4bn windfall if Britain 's only nuclear energy producer is sold .
This money is vital to fill the hole in the Government 's accounts as it considers deferring fuel duty increases .
British Energy is desperate to get the best possible price for its sale , but its attempts to create an auction have so far been unsuccessful .
The company insists it has received a number of indicative offers worth more than 680 p a share .
German energy giant RWE and Iberdrola of Spain are understood to be interested , but only EDF has tabled a fully detailed proposal .
Centrica , the owner of British Gas , is negotiating with EDF to buy a stake in any new - build nuclear company .
Every California eighth - grader will be tested in algebra -- ready or not -- under a policy approved Wednesday that could make the state the first in the nation to require an upper - level math class before high school .
The state Board of Education voted for the change under pressure from federal officials and Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger , who broke months of silence by siding this week with advocates who want algebra to become mandatory in eighth grade within three years .
Proponents say the new policy will push school districts to ensure that eighth - graders are ready for the demands of algebra .
Critics say the anticipated three - year time frame is unrealistic .
The new mandate , they contend , overlooks the real need to help school districts better prepare students .
Lucila Zetino , a summer school student at Monroe High in North Hills , typifies both the state ’s aspirations and its failings .
Advertisement
Zetino , 18 , was part of an early push to get all students into Algebra 1 in eighth grade .
Zetino flunked the class and has been flunking it ever since .
Now she is attending classes after her senior year -- giving it another try , determined to earn her high school diploma .
Zetino ’s struggles demonstrate the depth of the challenge .
Her math slide began at Millikan Middle School in seventh grade , she said .
Then came eighth - grade algebra , when her teacher quit and was followed by several long - term substitutes .
“ I do n’t think I was prepared .
I think they just , like , pushed me into algebra .
. . .
Math was like a different language I never understood .
I felt hopeless . ”
In the Los Angeles Unified School District , more than half of eighth - graders , along with more than 2,000 seventh - graders , took algebra in 2007 .
But only 21 % of eighth - graders tested proficient .
About two - thirds of those who failed the class passed on their second try .
At many low - performing campuses , the picture is more dire .
At Gompers Middle School in Watts , for example , only 30 % of eighth - graders took algebra , and only 15 % of those scored proficient .
Moreover , only 1 % of students in general math , an easier course , tested proficient .
Advertisement
The state ’s curriculum for eighth grade has long included algebra , and schools get penalized on their own report card , the state ’s Academic Performance Index , for every eighth - grader who does n’t take the algebra test .
The next step , the state board decided , was to force all students to take the test -- and thus an algebra course -- at a younger age .
Under the likely terms of an agreement with the U.S. Department of Education , the state would have three years to make the transition .
State Supt. of Public Instruction Jack O’Connell had proposed instead a second , easier , algebra test as a fallback for some students .
That test , already in development , would have been ready in spring 2010 .
Requiring all students to take algebra “ will hurt kids and contribute to other problems ; I pray that I ’m wrong , ” O’Connell said after the vote .
“ Absent additional resources , we ’re setting our students up for failure . ”

Statewide , only 24 % of students , regardless of age or grade , scored proficient in algebra in 2007 .
In eighth grade , 38 % tested proficient -- a number virtually unchanged since 2003 .
But more students are taking algebra : less than a third in 2002 and more than half today .
For months , O’Connell ’s two - test option had considerable support .
The governor ’s office raised no objection , and state board President Ted Mitchell co-signed a letter to federal officials with O’Connell .
“ Board members were uncomfortable with a second test that would create the appearance of mastery of algebra but not actually do that , ” said Mitchell , explaining why he and other board members altered their positions .

Federal officials have complained that California established algebra as eighth - grade material but did n’t require students to take the algebra test .
Instead , they could take the more basic general math test .
The requirements and the test have to match under federal law .
Washington could n’t tell California exactly how to comply with the law , said Holly Kuzmich , deputy chief of staff to U.S. Secretary of Education Margaret Spellings .
“ But education policy is leading us to getting kids access to algebra by the eighth grade , and we know that ’s what leads kids to jobs and college . ”
She added : “ We are delighted at the governor ’s push for high standards . ”
Kuzmich said she knew of no other state that required algebra as early as eighth grade .
For months , advocates lobbied against O’Connell ’s approach .

“ This $ 1 - million proposed ‘ algebra light ’ alternative test will be a disaster for California kids and teachers , ” said Jim Lanich , president of California Business for Education Excellence , before the vote .
“ It will be a watering down of academic standards .
. . .
It will institutionalize a lower expectation for minority and low - income kids . ”
There also were critics from a nearly opposite perspective who wanted a test that matched the state ’s new “ algebra readiness ” curriculum .
Some of these advocates wanted the state to wait out the Bush administration .
For them , even the easier algebra test was “ meaningless and cruel ” for students who , because they were n’t ready , had n’t taken algebra , testified Charles T. Munger Jr. , a math curriculum expert .
The state board postponed the decision in May and also punted in June , but had to act this month to avoid possible sanctions .
Advertisement
The federal government could have stripped away several million dollars that the state uses to oversee programs for students from low - income families .
The state also could have lost flexibility for developing reforms .
The approved solution creates another problem .
If 95 % of eighth - graders do n’t take the algebra test , a school could be judged as “ failing ” under federal rules and subject to penalties .
Schwarzenegger stayed out of the debate until 24 hours before trustees were to act .
“ We must set our goals higher , ” the governor wrote to the state board .
“ Algebra is the gateway to critical thinking , pivotal for success in science , engineering and technology . ”

To graduate , California students must pass two years of high school math , including Algebra 1 , and the high school exit exam .
To enter the California State or University of California systems , students need a C or better in three years of high school math , which usually takes them at least through Algebra 1 , Geometry and Algebra 2 .
In L.A. Unified , as in other urban districts , students will need more help before eighth grade .
The district has had trouble attracting and keeping qualified and effective math teachers .
Its teaching corps needs training in imparting the concepts of math as well as skills that will lead to algebra , said Jeanne Ramos , director of secondary mathematics .
Zetino ’s current teacher , Brian York , is taking part in a new effort among schools in his area to coordinate early math instruction .
Advertisement
“ You ca n’t just say , ‘ Eighth - graders , you ’re taking algebra , ’ ” York said .
Despite clear explanations , good humor and words of encouragement , York can expect only about 50 % of his class of algebra repeaters -- some of whom barely speak English -- to make it through , based on past experience .
But he ’s going to keep trying .
So is Zetino , who wants to be a cosmetologist or find a job in the arts .
“ I really want to graduate from high school , ” she said .
“ I ’m hoping I do good in this class . ”

Same - sex weddings start with union of elderly San Francisco couple
After 55 years Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin are married by Mayor Gavin Newson , Monday June 16 , 2008 , in San Francisco , Calif .
Lacy Atkins / The San Francisco Chronicle After 55 years Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin are married by Mayor Gavin Newson , Monday June 16 , 2008 , in San Francisco , Calif .

Cheers filled San Francisco's City Hall shortly after 5 p.m. as longtime lesbian activists Phyllis Lyon and Del Martin , partners for more than 50 years , began their second wedding - and their first legal union .
Mayor Gavin Newsom , who officiated the ceremony in the reception area of his office , said it was a fitting way to memorialize last month 's state Supreme Court decision legalizing same - sex marriage in California , which took effect at 5:01 p.m .
Lyon , 83 , and Martin , 87 , were the first couple married four years ago when Newsom told the county clerk 's office to start offering marriage certificates to same - sex couples .
Eventually more than 4,000 same - sex couples were married in San Francisco that year , but those unions were later nullified by the court .
Today , the couple , and dozens of others , had their first chance to make their unions truly legal .
In at least five counties around the state , other couples were pronounced " spouses for life " once the clock chimed 5 .
In Alameda County , Emeryville couple Kenny Latham , 47 , and Keith Boadwee , 46 , wore pink peonies in their lapels as they became the first gay couple in that county to marry .
In Sonoma County , a giddy Mark Gren , 42 and Chris Lechman , 37 , of Guerneville , applied for a marriage license at 5:01 p.m .
And in Los Angeles County , lesbian couple Robin Tyler and Diane Olson - who were plaintiffs in the lawsuit that led to the high court 's May 15 decision - donned matching white suits to tie the knot in a traditional Jewish ceremony .
Newsom waited until exactly 5:01 p.m. to begin the San Francisco ceremony , the only one in San Francisco tonight .
The women were declared spouses for life at 5:07 p.m. in front of about 50 friends and family members .
Martin came into the area in a wheelchair but stood for the ceremony .
The couple made their way out of the office and onto the balcony area where a cake - and large crowd - was waiting .
Rose petals fluttered down from the ceiling as the crowd cheered and cameras flashed .
" This is an extraordinary moment in history and extraordinary moment in time " Newsom said to the crowd .
" They are extraordinary people who have lived extraordinary lives and spent half a century fighting for justice and equality . "
Lyon drew laughter with her comments .
" When first got together , we were not really thinking about getting married , we were thinking about getting together , " she said .
" I think it 's a wonderful day . "
" Ditto , " Martin said .
Just before 5:30 p.m. , the couple cut their cake .
Although Lyon and Martin 's ceremony is the only one at City Hall tonight , hundreds of couples are expected to flood the domed building Tuesday for the first full day of legal same - sex marriage .
Elsewhere in California , most clerks are waiting until Tuesday to begin the same - sex weddings .
This evening in Sonoma County , dozens of county staff members and supporters counted the seconds down from 10 .
And at 5:01 p.m. - with a cheer - Gren and Lechman stepped up to apply for marriage license .
A few minutes later , the couple entered a small room adjacent to the clerk 's office to take their vows - " in sickness and in health , for better and for worse , come what may " - then both men said " I do . "
Outside , Unitarian Church members handed out little bunches of flowers , while another 18 couples and their families waited for their own special moment .
Joe Balestreri of Santa Rosa said he came just to witness the first wedding .
" Now that I have the choice it does n't mean I am going to rush in to it , " he said , laughing .
Oakland Mayor Ronald Dellums also planned to officiate about a dozen ceremonies at Oakland City Hall this evening , while another 35 couples are expected to wed at the Alameda County Clerk - Recorder 's office on Madison Street .
By 5 p.m. , the lobby of the clerk 's office was packed with couples and their friends , everyone antsy to start the ceremonies .
Around 5:20 p.m. , the first couple , Latham and Boadwee , finished filling out their wedding certificate and made their way upstairs for the ceremony .
The Emeryville couple celebrated their 10 - year anniversary in May , and chose traditional vows for their ceremony .
Janet Appel , a volunteer deputy marriage commissioner , officiated the wedding , telling the men that " no other words are as tender as these vows or important as these vows . "
Latham described the moment as a " victory . "
" We 've been together so long , we know what it means to be a couple , " Boadwee added .
" However , now we have the legal protection , wherever we go throughout the state people will recognize it . "
Not everyone is happy about the state Supreme Court decision , which ruled that denying gay and lesbian couples the opportunity to marry was a violation of their civil rights under the California Constitution .
Outside San Francisco's City Hall , hundreds of raucous opponents and supporters of same - sex marriage filled the sidewalk .
A woman from the church of Kansas pastor Fred Phelps - whose followers are known for their anti-gay slogans - stood behind several police barricades put up in Civic Center .
Along with two of her children , the woman loudly sang while waving derogatory signs .
Another protester drove around the block in a truck painted to look like an American flag with a sign that read " Sodomy is sin . "
Luong
Do , who said he drove up from San Jose , held a giant sign that read , " homo sex is a threat to national security . "
" We want to tell people this lifestyle they 're living is a death style that will get them diseases in this life and eternal hell in the second , " he said .
Others were there to support the pending nuptials .
One man strummed a guitar and sang " Going to the Chapel , " while Kathryn Werhane threw rose petals on some of the protesters .
" We want to support these weddings .
It 's love and tolerance for real , " she said .
" Any proclamation of love is good with us .
Why are they crashing our party ? "
Inside the building things were more subdued , though the excitement was palpable even earlier in the day .
Martin and Lyon 's friends started gathering early .
Arlene Rusche , 68 , and Clara Brock , 80 , sat on a bench outside the mayor 's office shortly after 3 p.m. and planned to witness the wedding .
Brock was one of the first members of Daughters of Bilitis , a lesbian - rights group that Martin and Lyon founded in 1955 .
" I never thought this was going to happen to tell you the truth , " Brock said .
" This is so , so big , " agreed Rusche , Brock 's partner for 17 years .
" I never thought it would happen in our lifetime .
It just shows we are making progress . "
Several feet away sat a couple on vacation from Ireland who happened to stumble on the historic event .
Christine Yearsley said she planned to stay at City Hall the rest of the afternoon to witness as much as she could .
" This gentleman just told me there are two elderly ladies who are getting married today after being together for 50 years , " she said .
" They 're obviously committed !
I think it 's terrific .
They 're an example for heterosexuals , I think . "

A new RAND report tackles the question :
The comprehensive study analyzes 648 terrorist groups that existed between 1968 and 2006 , drawing from a terrorism database maintained by RAND and the Memorial Institute for the Prevention of Terrorism .
The most common way that terrorist groups end -- 43 percent -- was via a transition to the political process .
However , the possibility of a political solution is more likely if the group has narrow goals , rather than a broad , sweeping agenda like al Qaida possesses .
The second most common way that terrorist groups end -- 40 percent -- was through police and intelligence services either apprehending or killing the key leaders of these groups .
Policing is especially effective in dealing with terrorists because police have a permanent presence in cities that enables them to efficiently gather information , Jones said .
Military force was effective in only 7 percent of the cases examined ; in most instances , military force is too blunt an instrument to be successful against terrorist groups , although it can be useful for quelling insurgencies in which the terrorist groups are large , well - armed and well - organized , according to researchers .
In a number of cases , the groups end because they become splintered , with members joining other groups or forming new factions .
Terrorist groups achieved victory in only 10 percent of the cases studied .
At age 24 , she has no way to know if it is easier for today 's atheists to be " out of the closet , " but she said she had encountered hostility .
The mother of a previous boyfriend " would n't talk to me when she found out I 'm an atheist , " she said .
An unprecedented glimpse into the harsh conditions at Guantanamo Bay has emerged via a grainy video of a weeping Canadian teenager undergoing interrogation after he had been tortured by sleep deprivation for three weeks .
The longest portion of video , an eight - minute segment , shows a sobbing Omar Khadr , just past his 16th birthday , burying his head in his hands and moaning " help me , help me " as Canadian intelligence agents look on .
Over the course of a three - day interrogation Mr Khadr denied any association with al - Qa'ida and showed the agents wounds that he suffered on the battlefield from which he almost died .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The footage , taken by a camera hidden behind a ventilation shaft , and obtained under court order by Mr Khadr 's Canadian lawyers , is the first video of a Guantanamo interrogation to become public .
The interrogation took place in February 2003 , six months after Mr Khadr 's capture by US forces on an Afghan battlefield .
The US says he killed a soldier with a grenade and injured another at an al - Qa'ida compound but efforts to persuade military courts that he is an " enemy combatant " were thrown out last year .
Mr Khadr 's mistreatment began after his arrival at Guantanamo when he was denied sleep and forced to move cell every few hours over a period of three weeks – a process the US military refers to as its " frequent flyer programme " – to soften him up for interrogation by Canadian intelligence agents .
But , before the rage and tears , came trust .
The teenager thought his fellow Canadians had come to help him and he answered their questions freely .
An extract from the video
By the second day of his three - day interrogation , the harsh reality of his predicament dawns on him as the agents ask about links to al - Qa'ida , his friends and fundamentalist family in Afghanistan .
They ask the boy if he believes dozens of black - eyed virgins awaited him in Janna , or paradise .
Realising that the Canadian agents were there to pump him for information , Mr Khadr wept openly and denied everything .
Distraught , he pulled at his hair and tore off the orange jumpsuit to reveal his wounds .
The interrogation was witnessed by Jim Gould – a Canadian diplomat who later wrote in a briefing note that he had met a " screwed up young man " whose trust had been abused by everyone who had ever been responsible for him .
Mr Khadr is a Canadian citizen who was raised by fundamentalist parents in Taliban - run Afghanistan , where he became caught up in the conflict after the attacks on the US on 11 September 2001 .

Four years after the interrogation , in April 2007 , the judge presiding at a military court in Guantanamo , dismissed all charges against him because the US could not prove he was an " unlawful combatant " .
Mr Khadr also faced charges of conspiracy , providing material support of terrorism as well as murder , attempted murder and spying on US forces .
His lawyers released portions of the video yesterday because they want to shame Ottawa into demanding his release from Guantanamo .
Now 21 years old , Mr Khadr has no idea if he will ever be freed from US custody .
At one point , an interrogator discusses Mr Khadr 's desire to go home to Canada .
The intelligence agent taunts him , saying he cannot help free him but suggests Mr Khadr help him stay on in Guantanamo .
" The weather 's nice [ in Guantanamo ] , " the Canadian agent says .
" No snow . "
Later , a distraught Mr Khadr says " I lost my eyes .
I lost my feet , " referring to his battlefield injuries .
" No , you still have your eyes , and your feet are still at the ends of your legs , " the agent responds .
Nathan Whitling and Dennis Edney , Mr Khadr 's lawyers are not claiming he was tortured during the interrogation .
The mistreatment happened in the run-up to the interrogation .
They said : " Guantanamo Bay authorities manipulated Omar 's environment outside the interrogation room before Canadian interrogations to induce co-operation within the room . "
Sleep deprivation is considered torture under international law and Mr Khadr was woken every three hours for 21 days before the interrogation .
The former US defence secretary Donald Rumsfeld wrote a memo explicitly allowing what he called " sleep adjustment , " defined as " [ adjusting ] the sleeping times of the detainee ... e.g. reversing sleep cycles from night to day . "
Despite Mr Khadr 's young age when captured and the evidence of mistreatment , Canada 's Prime Minister , Stephen Harper , said he will not seek his return .
Although Canadian officials say they were told by the US that Mr Khadr was being treated humanely , documents dating from 2003 and 2004 ( when Mr Khadr was 17 ) indicate officials knew of mistreatment .
Lt - Cdr William Kuebler , Mr Khadr 's US military lawyer , said : " What is being done to Omar Khadr right now rests squarely on the shoulders of Prime Minister Harper .
There is very little question that if Canada demanded Mr Khadr 's repatriation to face due process under Canadian law , that the US would heed that request . "
* One of Osama bin Laden 's former drivers told a military tribunal at Guantanamo Bay yesterday that he was groped by a female interrogator – conduct that his lawyers say should prompt a judge to throw out statements he made to officials during his confinement .
Prosecutors deny the claims of Salim Ahmed Hamdan , arguing that the Yemeni has lied about details of his capture .
He is due to face trial next week .

Egyptian law limits the age gap between spouses to 25 years
The Egyptian authorities have banned a 92 - year - old man from marrying a 17 - year - old girl , the Egyptian al - Akhbar newspaper has reported .
The ministry of justice invoked a law which says the age gap between spouses should not exceed 25 years .
Egypt brought in the law prohibiting the marriage of elderly men to very young girls during the Gulf oil boom .
It was an effort to prevent wealthy men from the Gulf states seeking young poor brides from the Egyptian countryside .
Not much is known about the 92 - year - old man who tried to marry an Egyptian girl of 17 except that he is an Arab from the Gulf .
An Egyptian justice official said by refusing to endorse their marriage it would now be impossible for the girl to travel abroad with her husband .
However , in special cases , the justice ministry does allow foreign men to marry Egyptian women more than 25 years their junior if they deposit a very large sum of money in the name of their wife at the Egyptian National Bank .
Both husband and wife also have to report in person to the ministry which checks their marriage is genuine to prevent any kind of trafficking in women .
According to the al - Akhbar newspaper , 173 such marriages were allowed in the past year after the foreign husband deposited a sum equivalent to about US $ 8,000 and was screened .

What are these ?
Microhoo !
Yahoo ! has terminated all acquisition talks with Microsoft , today saying Microsoft was only interested in the internet provider 's search business .
Yahoo !
shares fell 10 per cent today to $ 23.52 , from yesterday 's closing price of $ 26.52 .
The beleaguered company is hitching its fortunes to the Google juggernaut with a search , advertising and IM deal .
Google said Thursday it 's providing Yahoo ! access to its AdSense service in the US and Canada .
Also , the companies will work on interoperability between their competing IM systems .
Google stressed this is not a merger , wo n't take out any competitors , increase Google 's share of search traffic or prevent Yahoo ! from making similar arrangements with others .
Got that , US and EU regulators ?
Good .
In a statement today , Yahoo ! said all talks with Microsoft over acquisition have been concluded following numerous meetings between both sides .
Attending the meeting from Yahoo !'s side was chairman Roy Bostock and other independent board members .
The catalyst for the break up was a June 8th meeting during which Microsoft " stated unequivocally " it was not interested in purchasing the entire company " even at the price range previously suggested " .
Microsoft instead said it remained interested in buying Yahoo !'s search business only , as it stated last month .
" Such a transaction would leave the company without an independent search business that it views as critical to its strategic future and would not be in the best interests of Yahoo !
stockholders , " Yahoo ! said .
Yahoo !
thinks the online advertising industry will grow from $ 40 bn last year to $ 75bn in 2010 .
" The company believes it has the right assets , strategic plan , board of directors and management team to capitalize on this growth opportunity , " Yahoo ! said .
Microsoft said in a statement its offer for the search business is still on the table .
" This partnership would ensure healthy competition in the marketplace , providing greater choice and innovation for advertisers , publishers and consumers , " Microsoft said .
Microsoft 's opening shot on January 31 was $ 31 a share , about $ 44.6 bn .
Microsoft boss Steve Ballmer last month verbally offered $ 33 a share - worth another $ 5 bn - to Yahoo !
founders Jerry Yang and David Filo .
They held out for $ 37 a share , giving Ballmer his opportunity to walk away from the table .
Yahoo !'s “ all or nothing ” attitude is likely to inflame further gazillionaire greenmailer Carl Icahn , who is waging a proxy war to depose the incumbent board .
Class action suits also loom , with investors seeking to overturn generous pay - outs to staff who leave if the company is acquired , and remove other poison pills in place to fend off hostile takeover .
In early court skirmishes , Yahoo !
documents released to two angry Detroit pension funds reveal that the company declined an offer from Microsoft in January 2007 worth $ 40 a share .
The funds complain of the failure of fiduciary responsibility .
Icahn is muttering about holding the board personally responsible for letting Microsoft slip through .
This will get even messier .
We gotta get out of this place
Two more senior executives are leaving Yahoo !.
Jeff Weiner , executive vice president of the network division , and Usama Fayyad , chief data officer and executive vice president of research and strategic data solutions , announced their departures today , the New York Times reports .
Weiner , recruited by former chief executive Terry Semel , lad various portal - based activities spanning mail , Flickr , Answers news and entertainment .
Fayyad was in charge of data mining .
The follow in the footsteps , of course , of Semel and chief technology officer Farzad Nazem .

The first thing to keep in mind when you begin to set up your fishing tackle box is essentially how much time and money you will actually be committing to fishing .
Remember , once the bug bites , there is no known cure for fishing and the disease will spread until it works its way into every part of your life .
To start out , you will obviously need a tackle box .
Tackle boxes come in a myriad of configurations sizes and shapes .
To add to your conundrum is the addition of tackle bags .
These bags expand your carrying capability to luggage size and will hold literally hundreds of lures .
Initially , though , you should select a box which you can first and foremost afford , and one which will not only give you the ability to carry what you need to the lake or pond but also give you the ability to expand and add when you need to .
After you have your box and bag figured out , you will need a good pair of long nose pliers with non slip grips .
When a fish takes a lure or hook deep you need the long reach of pliers to remove the hook or hooks and save the fish .
A pair of scissors is also good to have on hand .
From cutting knots to tough braided lines , good scissors will serve you well on more than one occasion .
Next for your fishing tackle box are lures .
As far as lures go , research what you will need .
The point is to assemble a sampling of lures from which you can become both familiar and proficient at using .
Resist the temptation to stock up on one of everything especially if it is on sale .
There are lures that resemble nothing man has ever seen in nature and some that are spot on matches .
Basically , you won�t know which ones catch fish and which wo n't .
The point is to diligently work a few lures initially so that you learn the tricks and secrets of what makes the bait attractive to fish .
Your set up should include a few spinner baits and buzz baits .
The newer chatter baits are fun to fish and can often produce great catches .
Depending on the water you fish , crank baits should be considered , especially the lipless shad and shallow running minnows .
Also , mix up the sizes of your baits .
Many times bass anglers get caught up with fishing large baits for large fish .
This is a mindset that can cost you a lot of fish in the end .
If fish turn finicky , change up the size and or color of what you are throwing .
Many times this will do the trick and entice a big one to bite .
When setting up your fly fishing tackle box these are the things you will need to worry about most .
The most important thing is that you are comfortable with everything and it works for what you are fishing for and the conditions you will be dealing with .
Left - leaning Berkeley and right - leaning Palm Desert are unlikely bedfellows , but the two cities were twin forces behind California 's innovative solar and energy efficiency financing law enacted Monday .
The law , sponsored by Assemblyman Lloyd Levine ( D- Van Nuys ) , allows cities and counties to make low - interest loans to homeowners and businesses to install solar panels , high - efficiency air conditioners and other improvements to save energy .
Participants can pay back the loans as part of their property taxes .
If they move , the improvements and loan balance are transferred to the next owner .
The financing scheme , if adopted by cities , is likely to give a statewide boost to the installation of solar panels to generate electricity .
Solar power systems can cost between $ 15,000 and $ 30,000 - - more than many homeowners can afford , although state rebates cover much of the cost .
But with the loans , and the guarantee that the investment will not be lost when people sell their homes , the risk is dramatically reduced .
The original idea was hatched by Cisco DeVries , chief of staff for Berkeley Mayor Tom Bates .
More than a year ago , when it was presented at a meeting of mayors in Seattle , the proposal drew national and international attention , with inquiries from scores of public officials .
In November 2007 , the Berkeley City Council approved the plan for solar power loans that property owners could repay through a 20 - year assessment .
Palm Desert , a city with an aging population and high air - conditioning costs , jumped on the bandwagon and created the Palm Desert Energy Independence Program to offer the loans , setting a goal of reducing energy consumption by 30 % over five years .
Berkeley 's initiative , called " Berkeley FIRST , " is still in the pilot stage .
But Palm Desert boasts that its Office of Energy Management has already started a list of interested customers .
The city expects to be " the first city in the state to offer this benefit to its residents and businesses , " said Palm Desert Management Analyst David Hermann .
So now who 's " right " ?
And what cities will be " left " behind in the race for energy independence ?

Small Businesses Can Be a Big Deal for Resellers in the Cloud Space
Small Businesses are private corporations , sole proprietorships , and partnerships .
The term “ Small Business ” defines by different organizations in the context of no .
of employees but generally it is mentioned , businesses ranging from less than 10 employees to thousand employees are mainly categorized as small to mid-sized companies otherwise they are termed as SMBs .
According to the other methods , Small businesses can also be categorized as assets , sales , liabilities , purchases , net profit and others .
These companies range from a very small store to e-commerce businesses .
In 2006 , more than 18,000 small businesses possessing more than 500 employees constitute half of the total employees engaged in all the small businesses .
SMBs want to lead themselves so they are focusing on the ways of cutting the costs and expansion of their capabilities .
There are various ways and among this , one way is that they are moving their important functions to the cloud .
Recently a study was conducted which predicted and showed the value $ 32 billion of the U.S. SMB Market in 2016 which is almost 20 % growth rate occurred on year to year basis and also showed an increase of 25 % in the adoption of the total global cloud services .
Use of Web hosting is becoming very popular among the large size businesses and so are small businesses .
The small size companies are also having their websites in order to improve their competitive position and to host them ; they are also using the hosting services of various web hosting companies .
Usage of the cloud services and products of the infrastructure by SMBs is expected to become almost double for the next few years and the reason behind this that these SMBs become more user - friendly with the concept of cloud and do not face in using the same .
Now SMBs are looking for the cloud service companies as now they are moving several applications of business to the cloud .
SMBs are the small size companies thus they operate more efficiently and focus on their main business , outsource functions of technology and in this context , they prefer the established organizations .
Resellers are having a great opportunity ; they can open the new stream of revenue and expand their relationship with the existing customers .
VARs , MSPs , SIs wants to expand their portfolio to use the cloud services and for the same , they are required to increase their revenue and improve their relationships with SMBs .
Demand is rising very fast within the SMB market for the different kinds of cloud services ;
( IAAS ) Infrastructure as a service - From the study , it is known that safety , IaaS server backup , and services related to a database is used by 40 % of the SMBs .
Those are in the need of a robust database find the web hosting solutions which are flexible via a reasonable and convenient way so as to store a large amount of data in offsite without considering the issue of maintenance of the server .
In the SMBs market , there are some rapidly growing sectors such as Security services , anti-malware , anti-spyware , anti-virus , and e-mail safety solutions .
( SAAS ) Software as a service Apps - Social media platform used by no. of SMBs as a tool for marketing and access productivity apps such as Dropbox on the regular basis .
SMB ’s feel more comfortable with the cloud services , they started to embrace platforms of CRM such as Salesforce.com and other solutions related to business intelligence .
These tools are accessed via laptops and desktops in the office and also on the mobile devices such as tablets and smartphones .
Cloud services are used by SMBs for increasing the capabilities of the communication and for consolidating the infrastructure for more efficiency and integration on one platform .
E-mail and hosted private branch exchange ( PBX ) phone services are included in the applications but Unified Communications - as - a - Service solutions attract the market towards themselves .
It delivers audio / video conferencing , telephone , messaging , presence technology , and email more over an IP network .
Windows , like practically any other mainstream multithreading operating system , provides a mechanism to allow programmers to efficiently store state on a per - thread basis .
This capability is typically known as Thread Local Storage , and it ’s quite handy in a number of circumstances where global variables might need to be instanced on a per - thread basis .
Although the usage of TLS on Windows is fairly well documented , the implementation details of it are not so much ( though there are a smattering of pieces of third party documentation floating out there ) .
Conceptually , TLS is in principal not all that complicated ( famous last words ) , at least from a high level .
The general design is that all TLS accesses go through either a pointer or array that is present on the TEB , which is a system - defined data structure that is already instanced per thread .
The “ per-thread ” resolution of the TEB is fairly well documented , but for the benefit of those that are unaware , the general idea is that one of the segment registers ( fs on x86 , gs on x64 ) is repurposed by the OS to point to the base address of the TEB for the current thread .
This allows , say , an access to fs : [ 0x0 ] ( or gs : [ 0x0 ] on x64 ) to always access the TEB allocated for the current thread , regardless of other threads in the address space .
The TEB does really exist in the flat address space of the process ( and indeed there is a field in the TEB that contains the flat virtual address of it ) , but the segmentation mechanism is simply used to provide a convenient way to access the TEB quickly without having to search through a list of thread IDs and TEB pointers ( or other relatively slow mechanisms ) .
On non-x86 and non-x64 architectures , the underlying mechanism by which the TEB is accessed varies , but the general theme is that there is a register of some sort which is always set to the base address of the current thread ’s TEB for easy access .
The TEB itself is probably one of the best - documented undocumented Windows structures , primarily because there is type information included for the debugger ’s benefit in all recent ntdll and ntoskrnl .
exe builds .
With this information and a little disassembly work , it is not that hard to understand the implementation behind TLS .
Before we can look at the implementation of how TLS works on Windows , however , it is necessary to know the documented mechanisms to use it .
There are two ways to accomplish this task on Windows .
The first mechanism is a set of kernel32 APIs ( comprising TlsGetValue , TlsSetValue , TlsAlloc , and TlsFree that allows explicit access to TLS .
The usage of the functions is fairly straightforward ; TlsAlloc reserves space on all threads for a pointer - sized variable , and TlsGetValue can be used to read this per- thread storage on any thread ( TlsSetValue and TlsFree are conceptually similar ) .
The second mechanism by which TLS can be accessed on Windows is through some special support from the loader ( residing ntdll ) and the compiler and linker , which allow “ seamless ” , implicit usage of thread local variables , just as one would use any global variable , provided that the variables are tagged with __declspec ( thread ) ( when using the Microsoft build utilities ) .
This is more convenient than using the TLS APIs as one does n’t need to go and call a function every time you want to use a per- thread variable .
It also relieves the programmer of having to explicitly remember to call TlsAlloc and TlsFree at initialization time and deinitialization time , and it implies an efficient usage of per- thread storage space ( implicit TLS operates by allocating a single large chunk of memory , the size of which is defined by the sum of all per - thread variables , for each thread so that only one index into the implicit TLS array is used for all variables in a module ) .
With the advantages of implicit TLS , why would anyone use the explicit TLS API ?
Well , it turns out that prior to Windows Vista , there are some rather annoying limitations baked into the loader ’s implicit TLS support .
Specifically , implicit TLS does not operate when a module using it is not being loaded at process initialization time ( during static import resolution ) .
In practice , this means that it is typically not usable except by the main process image ( .exe ) of a process , and any DLL (s ) that are guaranteed to be loaded at initialization time ( such as DLL (s ) that the main process image static links to ) .
Next time : Taking a closer look at explicit TLS and how it operates under the hood .

Issues with Readline in Mac OS X
話の流れをまとめると次のような感じ。
Mac OSX で Ruby の Readline モジュールのヒストリ機能がなんか変ですよ
高尾さんがパッチを作って下さった
なんか色々大丈夫 ？
それで高尾さんが状況の確認用として作成されたのが次のテストコードというわけです。
#include < stdio.h > #ifdef HAVE_EDITLINE_READLINE_H
#include < editline / readline.h > #else #include < readline / readline.h> # include < readline /history.h> # endif int main ( int argc , char ** argv ) { HIST_ENTRY * entry ; int i ; using_history ( ) ; printf ( " history_base : %d
" , history_base ) ; add_history ( " 1 " ) ; add_history ( " 2 " ) ; add_history ( " 3 " ) ; printf ( " added 1 , 2 , 3 to history
" ) ; printf ( " history_base : %d
" , history_base ) ; printf ( " history_length : %d
" , history_length ) ; entry = history_get ( history_base ) ; printf ( " history_get( history_base ) : %s
" , entry -> line ) ; for ( i = 0 ; i <= history_length ; i++) { entry = history_get ( i ) ; printf ( " history_get ( %d ) : %s
" , i , entry ?
entry -> line : " NULL " ) ; } return 0 ; }
この結果は GNU Readline の場合次のようになります。これが本来望ましい動作であると思われます。
history_base : 1 added 1 , 2 , 3 to history history_base : 1 history_length : 3 history_get(history_base ) : 1 history_get(0 ) : NULL history_get ( 1 ) : 1 history_get ( 2 ) : 2 history_get (3 ) : 3
しかし Mac OSX 10.5 ( libedit ) の場合には次のようになるそうです。
history_base : 1 added 1 , 2 , 3 to history history_base : 1 history_length : 3 history_get(history_base ) : 2 history_get(0 ) : 1 history_get (1 ) : 2 history_get ( 2 ) : 3 history_get (3 ) : NULL
というわけで history_get の返り値がずれてしまっています。それで前に GNU Realine をつらつらと眺めていた縁あってちょっと試してみたところ、libedit はやっぱり何かが変 。

Issues with Readline in Mac OS X
Ubuntu 8.04 のlibedit( 2.9.cvs.20050518 となってて相当古い)を使ってこのテストコードを動かすと
GNU Readline と同じ挙動を示します。
history_base : 1 added 1 , 2 , 3 to history history_base : 1 history_length : 3 history_get(history_base ) : 1 history_get(0 ) : NULL history_get ( 1 ) : 1 history_get ( 2 ) : 2 history_get (3 ) : 3
しかしほぼ最新版に相当すると思われる
http://www.thrysoee.dk/editline/ からダウンロードした libedit-20080712-2.11.tar.gz を使用すると Mac OSX 10.5 で報告された挙動と同一になります。
history_base : 1 added 1 , 2 , 3 to history history_base : 1 history_length : 3 history_get(history_base ) : 2 history_get(0 ) : 1 history_get (1 ) : 2 history_get ( 2 ) : 3 history_get (3 ) : NULL
これにより libedit の 2005 年から現在までの変更点のどこかがおかしいと察せられるわけです。私は

しか書いてなくって、これが何の意図による変更なのかが全然分からないのですよね。私は
NetBSD について全く分からないのでこれ以上は手が出せません（ひょっとしてBSD系の環境ではこれでうまく動くのでしょうか）。この辺について詳しい方はおられませんでしょうか。というかそもそも
Mac OSX の libedit がこれを基にしているのかどうかも疑わしいので困ります。
この種の挙動の差異がもしひょっとすると libedit の実装次第だったりバージョン次第だったりする場合には、Ruby の
Readline モジュールに下手に修正を加えるわけにはいかなかったりしませんでしょうか。でも修正しないと
Mac OSX 10.5 で現実に困ってる人はどうすればいいんだろうとも思うので、とても悩ましいことになります。
ということまでメールに書いて ruby - dev に送ったわけなのですが 、M.Suzuki さんが Mac OSX 10.4 でテストコードを試された結果はさらに衝撃的なものに。

In the last week , the buzz has been growing that Sen. Joe Biden ( D - DE ) is soaring up the shortlist of potential running mates for Barack Obama .
Since Obama campaign manager David Plouffe has already suggested that geography , or a running mate ’s ability to deliver their home state , will not be a major consideration in selecting a running mate .
The rumors have grown that the Obama campaign is giving a serious look at Biden .
Plouffe signaled that political heft will be a consideration for the ticket , and if the campaign is looking for a political heavyweight , Biden could be their man .
Recent pieces on both the LA Times and Salon websites have suggested that Joe Biden would provide the perfect balance for Barack Obama .
Biden has firmly stuck to his denials about wanting the VP slot , but on his last appearance on Meet The Press he did say , “ If the presidential nominee thought that I could help him win , I ’m [ not ] going to say to the first African - American candidate about to make history in the world , no , I will not help you … Of course I ’ll say yes . ”
One of the things that is said to make Biden an attractive option is that as a Roman - Catholic he would help Obama with a group of voters which the Illinois Senator has struggled mightily to court .
Advertisements
He is also a foreign policy expert who would certainly help ease some of the doubts that might feel about Obama ’s ability to handle foreign affairs .
Few people understand policy better than Biden , and he could be seen as the perfect nuts and bolts compliment to Obama ’s big ideas and vision .
An added bonus is that Biden is tough as nails and would flourish in the running mate attack dog role , and he would certainly destroy any Republican in the Vice Presidential debate .
The interesting thing is that almost every Democrat that I talk to thinks that Biden would be a good solid choice for VP .
Biden would bring knowledge , experience , and a bit of blue collar toughness to the Obama campaign and he might be the best option to balance Obama ’s youth and relative inexperience .
Catch me if you can :
Towards type - safe , hierarchical , lightweight , polymorphic and efficient error management in OCaml , by David Teller , Arnaud Spiwack , Till Varoquaux :
This is the year 2008 and ML - style exceptions are everywhere .
Most modern languages , whether academic or industrial , feature some variant of this mechanism .
Languages such as Java even have a degree of out - of - the - box static coverage - checking for such exceptions , which is currently not available for ML languages , at least not without resorting to external tools .
In this document , we demonstrate a design principle and a tiny library for managing errors in a functional manner , with static coverage - checking , automatically - inferred , structurally typed and hierarchical exceptional cases , all of this for what we believe is a reasonable run-time cost .
Our work is based on OCaml and features simple uses of higher - order programming , low - level exceptions , phantom types , polymorphic variants and compile - time code
rewriting .
Exhaustively checked , user - friendly exception handling was a bit of an open problem for awhile .
As the paper details , languages supported either cumbersome , exhaustively checked polymorphic exceptions , as in Haskell , or we had unchecked easily extensible monomorphic exceptions , as in ML , or we had checked , extensible exceptions using a universal type as in Java .
Supporting exhaustively checked , easily extensible polymorphic exceptions seemed quite a challenge , which this paper solves using monadic error handling and nested polymorphic variants .
The paper also gives a good overview of current techniques of exception checking in OCaml , ie .
ocamlexc .
The performance of such exceptions is understandably lower than native exceptions , given all the thunking and indirection that monads entail .
The authors attempt various implementations and test their performance against native exceptions .
Ultimately , monadic error management seems acceptable for actual error handling , but not for control flow as native exceptions are sometimes used in OCaml .
One interesting extension is to consider how efficient the implementations would be given more sophisticated control flow operators , such as continuations , coroutines , or delimited continuations , or whether native exceptions can be salvaged using a type and effects system in place of monads .
In this blog you 'll find lots of programming and technology , a little music , a little personal , and a sprinkle of productivity geeking .

The Boba Fett re-design looks particularly good .
Sillof decided to change the T visor in the helmet for rounded goggles , while keeping the rest almost intact :
While Fett's " T " visor is iconic , this design keeps the look of the rounder goggles that have become a staple of the line , while the red strip down the middle hints at the old " T " design .
His forearm weapons feature a mini-crossbow and a working retractable blade .
The Surcoat is reminiscent of Fett 's shoulder cape .
His rocketpack is still there just in a larger more industrial model .

Head to Sillof 's to see some of these in 360 - degree rotating versions .
The details are simply stunning .

Can fruit make you fat ?
Natural sugar in fruit is ' fuelling the nation 's obesity epidemic '
Gone fruity : A natural sugar found in fruits could lead to obesity if it is used to sweeten foods
A natural sugar found in fruit is fuelling the obesity epidemic , scientists say .
A study has shown that fructose - which is used to sweeten soft drinks and junk food - might be more harmful than other types of sugar .
In tests , fat people given large doses of fructose were more likely to put on weight around the stomach than those given glucose .
Doctors say this ' intra - abdominal fat ' is the most harmful type and is linked to diabetes and heart disease .
Pure fructose is found in fresh fruit , fruit juice and jam .
However , it also sneaks into our diet through the high - fructose corn syrup used in food manufacturing .
Concerns about fructose and high - fructose corn syrup have been growing .
Some experts believe they play a major role in the obesity crisis sweeping Britain and the U.S .
Scientists at the University of California put 33 overweight adults on a diet comprising 30 per cent fat , 55 per cent complex carbohydrates such as bread and rice , and 15 per cent protein for a fortnight .
For a further ten weeks they were moved to a diet in which a quarter of their energy came from either fructose or glucose , New Scientist reports today .
Both groups put on the same amount of weight - 1.5 kg or 3.3 pounds .
However , volunteers on the fruit sugar diet put on more intra-abdominal fat , which wraps around their internal organs and causes pot bellies .
Those eating fructose also had higher levels of cholesterol .
The study , led by Dr Peter Havel , looked only at pure fructose - not high - fructose corn syrup .
However the syrup breaks down into fructose and glucose in the body .
Dr Havel said : ' The question is what is the amount of high - fructose corn syrup or normal sugar you need to consume to get these effects ? '
The finding suggests that the number of calories in food might not be as important as the type of sugar it contains .
A cake made with fructose could do more harm than one made with glucose .
A spokesman for PepsiCo , which sponsored Dr Havel 's work , said : ' This is a very interesting and important study .
But it does not reflect a real - world situation nor is it applicable to PepsiCo since pure fructose is not an ingredient in any of our food and beverage products . '
In a separate study , Dr Havel 's researchers compared the immediate effects of consuming a meal in which 25 per cent of the energy came from either high - fructose corn syrup , sucrose , fructose or glucose .
The level of triglycerides - or fats - in the blood were all elevated to a similar level 24 hours after consuming fructose , sucrose or high - fructose corn syrup , but not glucose , according to the findings published in The American Journal of Clinical Nutrition .
Sucrose breaks down into fructose and glucose in the body .
Dr Francine Kaufman , of the Keck School of Medicine in Los Angeles , said : ' It adds to what we have known for a long time .
' It 's probably not a good idea to consume too much sugar . '
Experts point out that this does not mean we should stop eating fruit .
Fresh fruit contains relatively low levels of fructose - and the risks are outweighed by health benefits .
Palestinian children in Gaza protest Israel ’s crippling siege on the Gaza Strip , April 2008 .
( Wissam Nassar / MaanImages )
USD
Naser al - Batran is a 41 - year - old father of five children living in the central Gaza Strip .
He used to work for a weaving factory inside Israel but found himself jobless after Israel ’s total closure of Gaza ’s travel and commercial crossings in June 2007 , worsening an already difficult economic situation since Israel began shutting out Palestinian laborers years ago .
“ Life has become miserable , extremely miserable , ” he said .
The crippling economic blockade of the Gaza Strip colors all aspects of life there .
According to the Hamas - run Palestinian Health Ministry , 70 percent of Gaza ’s 1.5 million residents suffer from anemia , including 44 percent of pregnant women .
Malnutrition among Palestinian children has also increased over the past 11 months , affecting more than 10 percent of Gaza ’s children under the age of 18 , according to the Gaza City - based Ard al - Insan health organization .
A recent survey conducted by Ard al - Insan revealed that around 10.4 percent of households in Gaza City and in the northern and southern Gaza Strip suffer from chronic malnutrition .
Stunting and low birth weights are also affecting children there .
“ The inability of the majority of Palestinian households to purchase basic food items has increased the magnitude of this health problem , ” explained Dr. Adnan Abdel Aziz al - Wahadi , the head of the health care unit of Ard Al - Insan .
“ In comparison with previous times , the demand for health and nutrition care has increased over the past 11 months , as evidenced , for example , by a survey conducted in 2003 indicating that only 3.4 percent of households had malnutrition during that year , ” Dr. al - Wahadi explained .
A large number of households in Gaza are currently unable to afford essential food items .
Israel ’s siege and collective punishment on the Gaza Strip following the democratically - elected Hamas government ’s takeover there a year ago has been characterized by severe restrictions on food and fuel imports .
The situation means that Palestinians in Gaza are simply unable to afford former staples .
Mohammed Mohareb , a fishmonger at the Nuseirat refugee camp market in the central Gaza Strip , complained of the residents ’ inability to buy fish .
“ Prior to these circumstances , I would bring in 100 boxes of fish , but now I only bring in 20 , and I still ca n’t sell all of the fish .
Now , I lose much more than I earn , ” he said .
Nour al - Din Abu - Saqer , a fruit vendor , standing idle behind his fruit stand in the Maghazi refugee camp market in the central Gaza Strip , lamented , “ Over the past couple of months , people have become even less likely to buy fruit , bearing in mind that for the past 11 months we have been selling less fruit than we used to . ”
“ We only sell fruit during the first week of each month when government employees obtain their salaries .
During the rest of the month , many of our goods perish as sales go down .
The prices are beyond people ’s purchasing power , especially for those who are unemployed , ” he explained .
The World Food Program states that 80 percent of households in the Gaza Strip depend on international food aid as the unemployment rate has reached more than 80 percent .
More than 95 percent of Gaza ’s industrial sector , involving textiles , canneries , weaving factories and metal workshops has already stopped working , rendering 32,000 laborers jobless .
Last month , Israel further reduced shipments of diesel , cooking gas , and food into the Gaza Strip , thus aggravating the deteriorating living conditions to the extent that many motorists were forced to use cooking oil instead of diesel to keep their vehicles running .
“ We are a society with no natural resources ; the only resource we have is the human one , so unless there is adequate food and health , how are we supposed to develop a nation ? ” wondered Dr. al - Wahadi .
For the time being , it seems this question will remain unanswered .
Rami Almeghari is currently contributor to several media outlets including the Palestine Chronicle , IMEMC , The Electronic Intifada and Free Speech Radio News .
Rami is also a former senior English translator at and editor in chief of the international press center of the Gaza - based Palestinian Information Service .

“ I ’ve made much more money by choosing the right things to say no to than by choosing things to say yes to .
I measure it by the money I have n’t lost and the quality I have n’t sacrificed . ”
- Danny Meyer of the Union Square Hospitality Group
Great quote .
From the book Small Giants : Companies That Choose to Be Great Instead of Big .
More about the book :
It ’s a widely accepted axiom of business that great companies grow their revenues and profits year after year .
Yet quietly , under the radar , some entrepreneurs have rejected the pressure of endless growth to focus on more satisfying business goals .
Goals like being great at what they do . . . creating a great place to work . . . providing great customer service . . . making great contributions to their communities . . . and finding great ways to lead their lives .
In Small Giants , veteran journalist Bo Burlingham takes us deep inside fourteen remarkable privately held companies , in widely varying industries across the country , that have chosen to march to their own drummer .
He searches for the magic ingredients that give these companies their unique “ mojo ” and the lessons we can learn from them .

A wide range of gemstones is consisted of minerals with a crystal like structure but we must keep in mind that all gems are not gemstones as they have an organic origin .
They take their shape because of biological processes that can be animals or plants as well .
These organic gems are not found in a wide range but they include some usual varieties that are considered very important in the gem business .
Amber , coral , jet , ivory and pearl are some member of this organic gem family .
Amber is considered as the fossilized toughen organic substance of the pine tree that came into being almost 50 million years back .
The use of amber in jewelry , religious objects and amulets is as old as hills ; it has been used in these things since prehistoric times .
There is addition of insects , plants or pyrites in the pieces of amber which are considered the most prized .
Kaliningrad in Russia is the place where the largest deposits of amber are found in the world .
There are also large reserves of the amber in the seabed of the Baltic .
Coral is counted as a branching skeleton - like formation that used to build by small sea animals that were called as coral polyps .
Reef - forming corals are the workers behind forming gem-quality coral .
Mediterranean , Red sea and coastal plans in Japan are the places where the most valuable coral variety is found .
Bright to dark , red to orange - red pink , white black and blue are some well - known color ranges of Corals .
Unpolished coral is dull but once it shines it gives an attractive glassy luster .
During 19nth century Jet was very popular but it ’s quite unique .
A bituminous coal that can be polished is called a Jet .
Jet ’s fame is related to Queen Victoria of England who wore jet as her mourning after Prince Albert ’s death .
Due to its light weight long necklaces of jet beads were popular enough among the women during 1920s .
Usually , the material of elephant ’s tusk is referred to Ivory but these days teeth of hippopotamus , walrus , wild boar and some other mammals also serve as ivory .
Ivory , just like bones , is consisted of calcium phosphate .
In the past when plastic was n’t commonly found , cutlery handles , billiards balls , some musical instruments and carved ornamental items were formed with ivory .
But many animals that have ivory tusk were killed to get their tusk and that was the reason that import and sale of ivory was strictly banned in many countries of the world .
Pearl is considered the king of all organic gems .
The use of pearls was quite obvious even more than 6000 year back .
There was a considerable pearl trade in China even by 2500 B.C .
The best quality of pearl is that they need not any processing the give their best unique features and full luster in their natural state .
Pearls are grown or cultivated in hinged shell mollusks of the oyster type .
Pearl are widely searched in different seas and streams .

This video has received enormous attention on the Internet recently with hundreds of thousands of views in just a few days .
It shows a New York City police officer picking a cyclist at random and violently assaulting him .
This kind of things has been going on in the US for many years .
Click here for a detailed report of a mass assault by police officers against cyclists ordered by then Mayor Willie Brown .
Mass Police Attack Ordered Against Critical Mass Riders by San Francisco Mayor ( 1997 )

Although I was never crazy about the idea , there was a time – several weeks ago now – when I considered the idea of an Obama - Clinton ticket to be a potentially good idea .
Andrew Sullivan ’s excellent column floating the idea moved me somewhat – even as I tended to think that Senator Jim Webb would be a better choice .
I had thought of Doris Kearns Goodwin ’s description of Lincoln ’s genius in organizing his “ team of rivals ” even before Sullivan mentioned it .
And I thought that Obama could pull it off if any politician today could .
But Maureen Dowd ’s description of Obama ’s and Clinton ’s interpersonal dynamic struck me as accurate enough , and Clinton continued to campaign – standing up for her supporters – “ hard - working white people ” ; comparing her efforts to de-legitimatize the process of delegate selection she at first endorsed to abolition ; and in general acting as if Obama ’s nomination were not only a personal affront to her but the end of the Democratic party .
So , I ’ve soured on the idea .
Here ’s seven reasons why Hillary Clinton should not be chosen as Obama ’s vice presidential running mate :
As a bonus :
Hillary ’s not going to help Obama win in November .
Let ’s get on to the main event already .
Drop out , Senator , and settle for becoming the next Secretary of Defense or a Supreme Court Justice .

We usually speak of storing and using energy without being very precise about what we mean .
That ends forever if you take a few chemistry or engineering courses .
Thermodynamics rules everything .
One of the most critical aspects of the implementation of renewable electricity is the ability to store electricity .
If a good solution existed right now , our situation would be a good deal easier .
On the face of it , compressed air seems a likely candidate : relatively easy to make , store and use - so what is the problem ?
Why is n't it used routinely ?
Let 's start with the usual definition of work - using a force to push something a given distance ( in the direction of the force ) .
The amount of work is the force multiplied by the distance , and has units of energy .
If we lift a 1 kg mass by 1 metre in the earth 's gravitational field on the surface of the earth , then the work done on it is the force required : 1 kg x 9.8 m/s2 ( 9.8 Newtons ) , times 1 metre , or 9.8 Joules .
Since a Watt is 1 Joule per second , then in principle ( no friction ) , this lift could be carried out in 9.8 seconds by a 1 Watt electric motor .
At the end of the process , the weight has acquired 9.8 Joules of gravitational potential energy .
We just constructed an energy storage device .
The weight we lifted could now be allowed to descend , giving its potential energy back to an electrical generator and making electricity in the process .
This is in fact the basis of possibly the most effective existing way of storing electricity .
Water is pumped from a low reservoir to a high one at times when there is a surplus of electricity , and then allowed to flow back when there is a shortage .
For useful amounts of energy storage using reservoirs that are not too large , one generally requires reservoir height differences of a hundred metres or more , which limits this to suitable terrain .
So what about compressed air ?
Surely a cylinder of compressed air contains energy that could be used to drive something ?
This is where it all becomes a little strange .
The energy content of compressed gas is n't very different from that of uncompressed gas at the same temperature .
For an ideal gas , the energy contents are identical .
How come we can get work from the compressed gas ?
The answer is that compressed gas has a lower entropy than the uncompressed gas , and that the amount of useful work you can get out of something when it changes depends both on the change in energy content and the change in entropy .
We usually focus so much on the energy side of things that we ignore the entropy side .
If the compressed gas has no more energy than the uncompressed gas , where did the energy used to compress it go ?
The answer can be found in the old bicycle pump experiment .
When you compress a gas it becomes hot .
In fact all the work put into an ideal gas to compress it is turned into heat .
If that heat is thrown away , the same amount of energy as was in that work is thrown away with it .
To look at a definite example , if we take 1 cubic metre of air at 1 atmosphere pressure and 20C and compress it to 10 atmospheres pressure , its temperature will increase very considerably - to 293C .
If we want to store this compressed air at 10 atmospheres pressure and 20C , then more compression will be needed as we cool the gas , or its pressure will drop as its temperature does .
The total work done on the gas , and the total heat lost are both about 91.7 Watt - hours ( Wh ) .
( This assumes that the air is an ideal diatomic gas . )
This gas would now have a lower entropy than the same amount of uncompressed air .
The entropy change is 796 J/K ( Joules per degree Kelvin ) .
Note the units are energy per degree .
This gives a hint of how the entropy change is related to the work that can in principle be extracted from the compressed air .
That work can be calculated by multiplying the entropy change by the temperature of the environment in degrees Kelvin .
20C is 293 K , so the amount of work that can in principle be extracted is 233 kJ , or 64.8 Wh .
If we compare this with the work done compressing the gas , we see that the efficiency of the process is about 71 % , even if the compressor is perfectly efficient .
Looking at the expansion of the same air back to 1 atmosphere , using a motor to do work in the process , we can work out that the temperature will fall to - 121C , and that the work that is done would be 47.5 Wh .
The efficiency of ths process is thus 47.5/64.8 = 73 % , even with a perfect motor .
The round - trip efficiency for energy storage and use would then be just 52 % .
With real compressors and motors it would clearly be considerably worse .
These numbers above are for a compression ratio of 10 .
If we instead use a compression ratio of 100 , things get worse still , with a round - trip efficiency of 27 % .
This actually gives a clue as to how to improve the situation .
The maximum efficiency of the cycle depends on the pressure ratio , and rises to 100 % as that ratio approaches 1 .
The answer is to use staged compression , with cooling back to ambient temperature between the stages , and staged expansion , with reheat back to ambient temperature between stages .
If we get the 100 times compression by two stages of times 10 each , then half the work goes into the first stage and half into the second , with efficiencies as for 10 times compression - a huge improvement .
If we use four stages ( ratio 3.17 ) , then the maximum effficiency would be 72 % .
If we take into account that real compressors and engines are not perfect , and neither are coolers and reheaters , we can see that real overall efficiencies achieved are never likely to be very good , even with very complicated equipment .
Whether technology is useful depends , though , on comparison with the alternatives .
The overall efficicency of a compessor train and a compressed air car may not look all that high , but an internal combustion vehicle engine can look pretty inefficient , even with North American fuel prices .
This means that an air - powered car may make some sense .
For more details on the MDI air car , see some MDI engine tests .
Notice that in a conventional car you get free heating , but in a compressed air car you get free cooling .
Bulk power storage is another matter .
Large reservoirs of compressed air can be and have been constructed , but they are not used simply to drive engines to regenerate power .
Building large heat exchangers to warm the air in a power generating unit would be very costly and not very efficient , so the air is instead heated to a much higher temperature before the expansion turbine by burning natural gas in it .
The whole installation is thus a sort of gas turbine , with the difference that the compressor and power turbines are run at different times instead of together .
This is no longer a straightforward energy storage device .
The US economic slowdown has brought not only sustained job losses , but also a steep rise in the proportion those unemployed for prolonged periods .
The number of people out of work for more than six months has shot up by 37 percent since June of 2007 , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
Last month , 1.5 million people had been unable to find work half a year or more .
Many of these workers , without paychecks or medical insurance and having exhausted their unemployment benefits , are confronted with foreclosure on their homes , evictions and the threat of destitution .
The number of long term unemployed is up from 1.1 million in June of 2007 .
The average duration of unemployment climbed from 15.1 to 15.9 weeks in June from a year earlier .
The increase in the number of long - term unemployed was twice the rise in the total number of jobless over the same time .
These figures come from the most recent Bureau of Labor Statistics report , which showed that the US economy shed 62,000 jobs in June , on top of an earlier 62,000 loss in May .
The unemployment rate , which shot up in May by the highest amount in over 20 years , remained steady at 5.5 percent , up from 4.6 percent a year ago .
June marked the sixth straight month of falling payrolls , with the US economy having lost 438,000 jobs since the beginning of the year .
The total number of unemployed reached 8.5 million last month , up from 7.0 million a year earlier .
The unemployment rate for prime - aged workers , those 25 and up , rose from 4.1 to 4.3 percent .
This shift was compensated by a decline in youth unemployment , leaving the overall unemployment rate nominally unchanged .
These figures do not take into account the 1.6 million people who are “ marginally attached ” to the workforce , who had looked for work in the previous 12 months , but not in the last month .
This figure includes approximately 420,000 “ discouraged workers , ” who had given up looking for work because they think that there is no work available .
The results followed layoff announcements from American Airlines , Goldman Sachs and Starbucks , which announced plans last week to close 600 stores and lay off 12,000 workers .
A significant portion of the June payroll loss was attributable to the construction sector , where employment fell by 43,000 .
The sector has lost some 528,000 jobs since the peak of the housing bubble in 2006 .
Manufacturing did not fare much better , with some 33,000 jobs slashed in the last month .
Manufacturing payrolls have shed 353,000 jobs in the past twelve months .
While six consecutive months of declining payrolls have always signaled recessions during the past 50 years , current estimates indicate that the US economy managed to continue growing in both the first and second quarters .
“ We have not really had a downturn quite like this one in which we lose jobs month after month but the economy somehow manages to grow , ” Nigel Gault , chief domestic economist at Global Insight , told the New York Times .
The fact that the economy has continued to grow while unemployment has shot up hints that adverse economic conditions have not fully made themselves felt in consumer spending .
This is likely due to the effect of the $ 78 billion in tax rebates recently sent out by the government , which may have temporarily boosted consumer expenditures .
Once those rebates are spent , however , it is likely that the economy will begin to contract and the current hemorrhaging of jobs will only accelerate .
According to a recent survey , consumer confidence has sunk to its lowest level in 16 years .
All the while , real wages have continued to plummet .
Median wages have increased by 2.8 percent in the past year ; the Consumer Price Index rose by over 4 percent during the same period .
This adds up to a decrease in median real wages of over 1.2 percent , as workers have lost bargaining power as the labor market has softened .
Congress responded to these developments last week by passing a law to extend the duration of unemployment benefits nationwide .
The bill adds 13 weeks onto the 26 weeks of unemployment benefits currently guaranteed by state governments .
The extension lasts only until March .
Moreover , to qualify for the extension , workers must have been on the job for 20 months before being laid off , a provision that excludes 10 percent of the long term unemployed .
The provision is estimated to cost some $ 8 billion , and was included in a bill funding the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan through 2009 .
In comparison to the war funding provision , estimated at $ 162 billion , the aid to the millions of unemployed amounts to a pittance .
The rise in overt militarism and imperialism at the outset of the twenty - first century can plausibly be attributed largely to attempts by the dominant interests of the world economy to gain control over diminishing world oil supplies .
1
Beginning in 1998 a series of strategic energy initiatives were launched in national security circles in the United States in response to : ( 1 ) the crossing of the 50 percent threshold in U.S. importation of foreign oil ; ( 2 ) the disappearance of spare world oil production capacity ; ( 3 ) concentration of an increasing percentage of all remaining conventional oil resources in the Persian Gulf ; and ( 4 ) looming fears of peak oil .
The response of the vested interests to this world oil supply crisis was to construct what Michael Klare in Blood and Oil has called a global “ strategy of maximum extraction . ”
2
This required that the United States as the hegemonic power , with the backing of the other leading capitalist states , seek to extend its control over world oil reserves with the object of boosting production .
Seen in this light , the invasion and occupation of Afghanistan ( the geopolitical doorway to Western access to Caspian Sea Basin oil and natural gas ) following the 9/11 attacks , the 2003 invasion of Iraq , the rapid expansion of U.S. military activities in the Gulf of Guinea in Africa ( where Washington sees itself as in competition with Beijing ) , and the increased threats now directed at Iran and Venezuela — all signal the rise of a dangerous new era of energy imperialism .
The Geopolitics of Oil
In April 1998 the United States for the first time imported the majority of the petroleum it consumed .
The crossing of this threshold pointed to a very rapid growth in U.S. foreign oil dependency .
At the same time fears that the world would soon reach peak oil production became increasingly prominent , assuming a high profile behind the scenes in establishment discussions .
A key event was the publication in Scientific American in March 1998 of “ The End of Cheap Oil ” by retired oil industry geologists Colin J. Campbell and Jean H. Laherrère .
“ The End of Cheap Oil ” predicted that world oil production would peak “ probably within 10 years . ”
The Campbell and Laherrère article and the question of peak oil immediately drew the attention of the International Energy Agency ( IEA ) , the OECD ’s energy organization , in its World Energy Outlook of 1998 .
The IEA claimed that even adopting the pessimists ’ assumptions on the real extent of world oil reserves and the existence of a bell - shaped production curve ( but without the sharp oil price hike suggested by Campbell ) , its own long - term supply model “ would not peak until around 2008 – 2009 . ”
Employing the IEA ’s own assumptions on reserves , moreover , would push the peak back around a decade further .
3
This , however , was still far from distant .
The peaking of United Kingdom North Sea oil production in 1999 ( Norwegian production peaked two years later ) added a still greater sense of urgency .
Matthew Simmons , CEO of the Houston - based energy investmentbanking firm Simmons and Company International and a member of the National Petroleum Council and the Council on Foreign Relations , published an article in Middle East Insight in 1999 in which he emphasized the “ far faster ” depletion of major oil fields arising from high - extraction technology .
Rather than extending the life of oil fields as previously supposed , the introduction of this technology most likely accelerated their depletion .
Referring to oil fields “ brought into production since 1970 , ” Simmons noted that “ almost all of these new fields have already reached peak production and are now experiencing rapid rates of decline …
fAnd when the stable base of old , but giant , fields also starts to deplete , ” he asked , “ what will this do to the world ’s average depletion rate ? ”
4
In 2000 Simmons ’s concerns regarding diminishing oil supply led to his becoming an energy advisor for George W. Bush ’s presidential campaign .
As he recounted it in a February 2008 interview , he had “ pulled aside ” Bush ’s “ first cousin ” in early March 2000 to tell him of an earlier conversation he had had with an assistant to Secretary of Energy Bill Richardson , who had been sent to examine the spare oil production capacity of the OPEC countries .
As Simmons reported to Bush ’s cousin :
I said , “ When you have someone who is the head of U.S. oil policy call you and [ say ‘ shit !’ ] about five times in 20 seconds , this is so much worse than what they ’ve warned us about . ”
I said , “ Between now and the election , if this all breaks out and Bush is misinformed , he can mispronounce every head of state in the world , but this , this will sink you . ”
And that dragged me into helping create the comprehensive energy plan put forth by Bush when he was running .
5
Simmons was a member of the Bush - Cheney Energy Transition Advisory Committee , advising on the growing oil constraints .
His 2005 book , Twilight in the Desert : The Coming Saudi Oil Shock and the World Economy , arguing that the Saudi oil production peak was imminent , has become one of the most influential works propounding the peak oil notion .
6
The Energy Information Administration ( EIA ) of the U.S. Department of Energy conducted a full assessment of the peak oil issue as early as July 2000 , considering a number of scenarios .
As opposed to those who saw the peak occurring “ as early as 2004 ” the EIA concluded that “ world conventional oil production may increase two decades or more before it begins to decline . ”
The analysis itself , however , was not altogether reassuring to the vested interests , since it suggested that a world oil peak could be reached as early as 2021.7
These concerns with regard to world oil supply that began to penetrate the corridors of power in the 1998 –2001 period led to a wide - ranging debate within the inner circles in the United States about the nature of the oil extraction problem and the strategic means with which to alleviate it .
This was increasingly integrated with wider issues on the expansion of the U.S. empire raised by groups such as the Project for a New American Century .
8
In July 1998 the Center for Strategic and International Studies ( CSIS ) launched its “ Strategic Energy Initiative , ” at the urging of former chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee Sam Nunn and former secretary of defense ( and former secretary of energy ) James R. Schlesinger .
In November 2000 , the Strategic Energy Initiative issued a three volume report , The Geopolitics of Energy into the 21st Century , with Nunn and Schlesinger as cochairs .
It stressed that the Persian Gulf would have to expand its energy production “ by almost 80 percent during 2000 – 2020 ” in the face of rising demand and declining oil production elsewhere in the world in order to meet world energy needs .
The question of a world oil peak in the decade 2000 – 10 was also examined , focusing on the arguments of Campbell and Laherrère and Simmons .
The CSIS Strategic Energy Initiative officially rejected the notion that the world oil peak would be reached as early as 2010 .
Nevertheless , its report took the peak oil issue extremely seriously .
As the “ only superpower ” the United States , it declared , had “ special responsibilities for preserving worldwide energy supply ” and “ open access ” to the world ’s oil .
Underscored throughout the report was the necessity of finding ways to increase oil exports from Iraq and Iran both then under U.S. economic sanctions .9
In 2001 the James Baker III Institute for Public Policy of Rice University and the Council on Foreign Relations cosponsored a study of Strategic Energy Policy Challenges for the 21st Century , chaired by energy analyst Edward L. Morse .
Task force members included both oil optimists , such as Morse and Daniel Yergin of Cambridge Energy Research Associates , and oil pessimists such as peak oil proponent Simmons .
The Baker Institute / Council on Foreign Relations report emphasized the adequacy of world oil reserves for decades to come but argued that world oil was facing “ tight supply ” due to “ underinvestment ” in new production capacity and “ volatile states . ”
Excess capacity had been “ wiped out , ” falling to “ negligible ” amounts , partly due to oil producing countries devoting oil revenues to social projects rather than to investment in new production capacity .
In this situation , the Baker Institute / Council on Foreign Relations report pointed out that Iraq had emerged as a key “ swing producer ” of oil , operating well below capacity , and in the previous year “ turning its taps on and off when it has felt such action was in its strategic interests to do so . ”
This presented a growing danger to the world capitalist economy , which included the “ possibility that Saddam Hussein may remove Iraqi oil from the market for an extended period . ”
Indeed , “ Iraqi reserves , ” the Strategic Energy Policy report emphasized , “ represent a major asset that can quickly add capacity to world oil markets and inject a more competitive tenor to oil trade . ”
Investment in the enhancement of Iraqi oil production capacity was essential .
The problem was what to do about Saddam Hussein .
Overall , the Baker Institute / Council on Foreign Relationsreport emphasized , the stakes were exceedingly high , since there was a danger that oil price increases and supply shortages would make “ the United States appear more similar to a poor developing country . ”
The answer was for the Western powers led by the United States to play a more direct role in the development of world oil resources .
This would be coupled with replacement of the current political economy of oil dominated by national oil companies , which had arisen with the growth of “ resource nationalism ” in the third world , with one in which the multinational oil corporations centered in the advanced capitalist economies once again took charge of reserves and investments .
10
These reports by national security analysts on strategic energy policy were followed in May 2001 by the White House release of its National Energy Policy , issued under the direction of Vice President Dick Cheney .
It too emphasized the need for U.S. petroleum security , noting that total U.S. oil production had fallen 39 percent below its 1970 peak and that U.S. reliance on foreign oil imports could increase to almost two - thirds of its total gasoline and heating oil consumption by 2020 .
President Bush warned in May 2001 that dependence on foreign crude oil put U.S. “ national energy security ” in the hands of “ foreign nations , some of whom do not share our interests . ”
In terms of the long - term world oil supply outlook , the U.S. Department of Energy ’s International Energy Outlook in 2001 projected the need for a doubling of Persian Gulf oil production over 1999 levels by 2020 in order to meet expected world demand .
This optimistic forecast could not possibly be fulfilled , however , without massive investment in an expansion of capacity in the Persian Gulf of a kind that key states , such as Iraq and Iran , and even Saudi Arabia , seemed unlikely to undertake .
Iraqi crude oil production in 2001 was 31 percent less than in 1979 , while Iran ’s had fallen by about 37 percent since 1976 .
Both nations were viewed as underproducing due to underinvestment and the effects of sanctions .
The IEA estimated that Persian Gulf states would have to invest over half a trillion dollars on new equipment and technology for oil production capacity expansion by 2030 in order to meet projected oil production levels .
11
U.S. national security and energy analysts as well as energy corporations and the Bush administration had thus arrived at the conclusion by spring 2001 that , while substantial oil reserves still existed , capacity was extremely tight , presaging a series of oil price shocks .
Only a vast increase of oil production in the Persian Gulf as a whole could prevent an enormous gap emerging between oil production and demand over the next two decades .
Behind all of this lay the specter of peak oil production .
Rather than try to solve the problem on the demand side by lessening consumption , the Bush administration turned , as had all other administrations before it , to the military as the ultimate guarantor .
As Michael Klare wrote in his Blood and Oil :
In the months before and after 9/11 , the Bush administration fashioned a comprehensive strategy for American domination of the Persian Gulf and the procurement of ever - increasing quantities of petroleum .
It is unlikely that this strategy was ever formalized in a single , all - encompassing White House document .
Rather , the administration adopted a series of policies that together formed a blueprint for political , economic , and military action in the Gulf .
This approach — I call it the strategy of maximum extraction — was aimed primarily at boosting the oil output of the major Gulf producers .
But since the sought - after increases could be doomed by instability and conflict in the region , the strategy also entailed increased military intervention .
12
Militarily the issue was one of shoring up Saudi Arabia in the face of growing signs of instability , carrying out regime change in Iraq , and exerting maximum pressure on Iran .
Key figures in the Bush administration such as Donald Rumsfeld and Paul Wolfowitz had been pushing for an invasion of Iraq even before the election .
Once the September 2001 attacks occurred , the “ War on Terrorism ” led to the invasion first of Afghanistan , giving the United States a geopolitical doorway ( and pipeline route ) to Central Asia and the Caspian Sea Basin , followed by the invasion in 2003 of Iraq .
From the standpoint of the geopolitics of oil , Saddam Hussein ’s removal and the occupation of Iraq was seen as enhancing the security of Middle East oil , presenting the possibility of a big boost in Iraqi oil production , and providing a staging ground for increased U.S. military , political , and economic dominance of the Gulf .
U.S. strategic control of the Middle East and its oil was viewed as the key to establishing the basis of a “ new American century . ”
As former Federal Reserve Board Chairman Alan Greenspan , the top U.S. economic official throughout this period , stated in his book The Age of Turbulence in 2007 : “ I am saddened that it is politically inconvenient to acknowledge what everyone knows : that the Iraq war is largely about oil . ”
The U.S. invasion of Iraq , Greenspan claimed , needed to be seen against the background of previous Western military interventions aimed at securing the oil of the region , for example : “ the reaction , to and reversal of , Mossadeq ’s nationalization of Anglo - Iranian oil in 1951 [ resulting in the CIA ’s overthrow of Iranian Prime Minister Mossadeq and the installation of the Shah in 1953 ] and the aborted effort by Britain and France to reverse Nasser ’s takeover of the key Suez Canal link for oil flows to Europe in 1956 . ”
The U.S. intervention in Iraq and its increased military role in the Middle East was , for Greenspan — the leading spokesperson for financial capital in the 1990s and early 2000s — justified by the fact that “ world growth over the next quarter century at rates commensurate with the past quarter century will require between one - fourth and two - fifths more oil than we use today . ”
And this vast increase in oil production needed to come largely from the Persian Gulf , where two - thirds of the world ’s reserves and hence most of its capacity for increased extraction was located .13
Although the Bush administration criticized Greenspan ’s statement , the centrality of oil in the occupation of Iraq was not something that it could easily deny .
In a September 13 , 2007 , prime time television speech , Bush declared that if the United States were to pull out of Iraq “ extremists could control a key part of the global energy supply . ” 14
Peak Oil : A Global Turning Point ?
In the five years that have elapsed since the United States invaded Iraq the world oil supply problem has drastically worsened .
Estimates of the potential for increased Iraqi oil production made prior to the war had suggested that Iraq free of sanctions could potentially increase its crude oil production within a decade from its previous 1979 high of 3.5 million barrels a day ( mb/d ) to 6 or even 10 mb / d.15 Instead , Iraq ’s average annual oil production in 2007 had fallen to 13 percent below its 2001 level , having declined from 2.4 to 2.1 mb /d .
Oil production in the Persian Gulf as a whole increased by 2.4 mb/d on average between 2001 and 2005 and then dropped by 4 percent in 2005 – 07 , along with the stagnation of world oil production as a whole .
16
At the time U.S. troops reached Baghdad peak oil was already a specter looming over the globe .
Today it is present in all establishment discussions of the world oil issue .
Peak oil is not the same as running out of oil .
Rather it simply means the peaking and subsequent terminal decline of oil production , as determined primarily by geological and technological factors .
The extraction of oil from any given oil well typically takes the form of a symmetrical , bell - shaped curve with extraction steadily rising , e.g. , by 2 percent a year , until a peak is reached when about half of the accessible oil has been extracted .
Since oil production for an entire country is simply a product of the aggregation of individual wells , national oil production can be expected to take the form of a bell - shaped curve as well .
Geologists have become adept at estimating the point at which a peak in national production will occur .
These methods were pioneered in the 1950s by oil geologist M. King Hubbert , who achieved fame for successfully predicting the U.S. oil peak in 1970 .
The eventual peak in oil production is therefore sometimes known as “ Hubbert ’s peak . ”
Peak oil is generally viewed in terms of the peaking of conventional crude oil supplies on which the main estimates of oil reserves are based .
There are also unconventional sources of oil that can be produced at much greater cost and with a much lower energy returned on energy invested ( EROEI ) ratio .
These include heavy oil , petroleum derived from oil sand , and shale oil .
As the price of oil rises some of these sources become more exploitable , but also at much greater cost — monetarily and to the environment .
It is estimated that it takes an equivalent of two out of three barrels of oil produced to pay for the energy and other costs associated with extracting oil from the tar sands in Alberta .
It requires one billion cubic feet of natural gas to generate one million barrels of synthetic oil from oil sands .
Two tons of sand must be mined to get one barrel of oil .
Oil sand mining also requires vast quantities of water , producing two and a half gallons of toxic liquid waste for every barrel of oil extracted .
This liquid waste is stored in enormous and rapidly expanding “ tailing ponds . ”
The economic and environmental costs are thus prohibitive .
Peak oil therefore inevitably signals the end of cheap oil .17
A key part of the argument on peak oil is the fact that discoveries of oil fields worldwide peaked in the 1960s , while the average size of new discoveries has also declined over time .
Those who argue that peak oil is imminent insist that estimates of proven reserves are commonly exaggerated for political reasons , and that actual retrievable reserves may be considerably less .
The conventional notion that there are forty years of crude oil production remaining at current rates of output is seen as misleading , since it exaggerates the reserves in the ground and downplays the fact that the economy requires that oil demand and production levels increase .
Peak oil analysts therefore focus on production levels rather than reserves .
The peak oil crisis is more sharply defined than the more general crisis in energy , since not only is petroleum the most protean fuel , but it is also the preeminent liquid fuel in transportation , for which there is no easy substitute in the quantities needed .
Therefore more than two - thirds of U.S. oil demand is in the form of gasoline and petrodiesel consumption by cars and trucks .
An imminent peak in conventional oil thus strikes at the lifeblood of the existing capitalist economy .
It presents the possibility of a drastic economic dislocation and slowdown .18
The peak oil debate , which has often been fierce over the past decade , has now narrowed down to two basic positions .
One of these is that of “ early peakers ” ( usually seen as peak oil proponents proper ) .
These analysts argue that peak oil will probably be reached by 2010 – 12 , and may have already been reached in 2005 – 06 .
The alternative position , represented by “ late peakers , ” is that the world oil peak will not be reached until 2020 or 2030.19
Hence , there is a growing consensus that peak oil is or will soon be a reality .
The chief question now is how soon , and whether it is already upon us .
An added consideration is whether world oil production will face a classic bell - shaped curve , culminating in a slender , rounded peak , to be followed quickly by a decline ( within what can be viewed as a symmetrical curve ) — or whether production will rise to a plateau and then stay there for a while , before declining .
In fact , world oil supply appears already to have reached a plateau over the last three years at the level of 85 mb/d .
This therefore has lent credence to the notion that this is the form the peak will initially take .

Sources include natural gas liquids and condensates , refinery processing gains , and the production of conventional and unconventional oil . ”
Conventional or crude oil is readily processed oil “ produced from underground hydrocarbon reservoirs by means of production wells . ”
Unconventional oil is derived from other processes , such as liquefied natural gas , oil sands , oil shales , coal - to - liquid , biofuels , “ and / or [ other fuel that ] … needs additional processing to produce synthetic crude . ” 20 The lower line in chart 1 , labeled “ crude oil production , ” refers simply to production of conventional oil .
The higher line , labeled “ world oil supply , ” also includes unconventional sources plus net refinery processing gains ( losses ) .
The “ crude oil production ” line shows a very slight dip in 2005 – 07 , reflecting the fact that crude oil production fell from an average of 73.8 mb/d in 2005 to 73.3 mb/d in 2007 .
The “ world oil supply ” line , however , remains level at about 85 mb/d due to a compensating rise in unconventional sources over the same period , resulting in what appears to be a more definite plateau .
Explaining that a plateau is the most likely initial outcome at the world level , Richard Heinberg , a leading peak oil proponent , writes :
Why the plateau ?
Oil production is constrained by economic conditions ( in an economic downturn , demand for oil falls off ) , as well as by political events such as war and revolutions .
In addition , the shape of the production curve is modified by the increasing availability of unconventional petroleum sources ( including heavy oil , natural gas plant liquids , and tar sands ) , as well as new extraction technologies .
The combined effect of all of these factors is to cushion the peak and lengthen the decline curve .
21
The notion that a partly geological - technical , partly political - economic , plateau is emerging has now become the dominant view in the industry .
In November 2007 the Wall Street Journal reported :
a growing number of oil - industry chieftains are endorsing an idea long deemed fringe :
The world is approaching a practical limit to the number of barrels of crude oil that can be pumped every day … .
The near adherents [ to the peak oil view ] — who range from senior Western oil - company executives to current and former officials of the major world exporting countries — do n’t believe that the global oil tank is at the half - empty point .
But they share the belief that a global production ceiling is coming for other reasons : restricted access to oil fields , spiraling costs and increasingly complex oil - field geology .
This will create a production plateau , not a peak , they contend , with oil output remaining relatively constant rather than rising or falling .
The Wall Street Journal article referred to the estimates of Cambridge Energy Research Associates , asserting that the peak will not be reached until 2030 and that it will manifest itself at first as an “ undulating plateau . ”
But the Journal article also took seriously the views of Simmons , who pointed out that , due to declining production in old fields , an increased average daily oil production equivalent to ten times current Alaskan production was needed “ just to stay even . ”
Indeed , “ at the furthest out , ” he suggested , the crisis associated with the world peak in conventional oil production would be reached “ in 2008 to 2012 . ”
Echoing many of the same worries , some oil executives have raised the specter of an oil supply ceiling of 100 million barrels ( conventional and unconventional ) , with petroleum supply likely falling short of expected demand within a decade or less .

Given the appearance of a world oil production plateau at present , and with oil supply seemingly stuck at the 85 mb/d level , it is not surprising that some analysts believe that peak oil has already been reached .
Thus Simmons and Texas oil billionaire T. Boone Pickens have both raised the question of whether the peak was reached in 2005 .
While the Energy Watch Group in Germany , which includes both scientists and members of the German parliament , contends that “ world oil production … peaked in 2006 .
”
23
Publicly of course the peak oil problem has often been characterized by establishment sources and the media as a “ fringe issue . ”
Yet over the past decade the question has been pursued systematically with increasing concern within the highest echelons of capitalist society : within both states and corporations .
24 In February 2005 the U.S. Department of Energy released a major report that it had commissioned entitled Peaking of World Oil Production : Impacts , Mitigation , and Risk Management .
The project leader was Robert L. Hirsch of Science Applications International Corporation .
Hirsch had formerly occupied executive positions in the U.S. Atomic Energy Commission , Exxon , and ARCO .
The Hirsch report concluded that peak oil was a little over two decades away or nearer .
“ Even the most optimistic forecasts , ” it stated , “ suggest that world oil peaking will occur in less than 25 years . ”
The main emphasis of the Hirsch report commissioned by the Department of Energy , however , was on the issue of the massive transformations that would be needed in the economy , and particularly transportation , in order to mitigate the harmful effects of the end of cheap oil .
The enormous problem of converting virtually the entire stock of U.S. cars , trucks , and aircraft in just a quarter - century ( at most ) was viewed as presenting intractable difficulties .
25
In October 2005 , Hirsch wrote an analysis for Bulletin of the Atlantic Council of the United States on “ The Inevitable Peaking of World Oil Production . ”
He declared there that , “ previous energy transitions ( wood to coal , coal to oil , etc. ) were gradual and evolutionary ; oil peaking will be abrupt and revolutionary .
The world has never faced a problem like this .
Without massive mitigation at least a decade before the fact , the problem will be pervasive and long lasting .
” 26
Similarly , the U.S. Army released a major report of its own in September 2005 stating :
The doubling of oil prices from 2003 –2005 is not an anomaly , but a picture of the future .
Oil production is approaching its peak ; low growth in availability can be expected for the next 5 to 10 years .
As worldwide petroleum production peaks , geopolitics and market economics will cause even more significant price increases and security risks .
One can only speculate at the outcome from this scenario as world petroleum production declines .
27
Indeed , by 2005 there was little doubt in ruling circles about the likelihood of serious oil shortages and that peak oil was on its way soon or sooner .
In its 2005 World Energy Outlook the IEA raised the issue of Simmons ’s claims in Twilight in the Desert that Saudi Arabia ’s super - giant Ghawar oil field , the largest in the world , “ could , ” in the IEA ’s words , “ be close to reaching its peak if it has not already done so . ”
Likewise the U.S. Department of Energy , which had initially rejected Simmons ’s assessment , backtracked between 2004 and 2006 , degrading its projection of Saudi oil production in 2025 by 33 percent .
28
In February 2007 the U.S. Government Accountability Office ( GAO ) released a seventy - five - page report on Crude Oil pointedly subtitled : Uncertainty about Future Oil Supply Makes It Important to Develop a Strategy for Addressing a Peak and Decline in Oil Production .
It argued that almost all studies had shown that a world oil peak would occur sometime before 2040 and that U.S. federal agencies had not yet begun to address the issue of the national preparedness necessary to face this impending emergency .
For the GAO the threat of a major oil shortfall was worsened by the political risks primarily associated with four countries , accounting for almost one - third of world ( conventional ) reserves : Iran , Iraq , Nigeria , and Venezuela .
The fact that Venezuela contained “ almost 90 percent of the world ’s proven extra - heavy oil reserves ” made it all the more noteworthy that it constituted a significant “ political risk ” from Washington ’s standpoint.29
In April 2008 , Jeroen van der Ver , CEO of Royal Dutch Shell , pronounced that “ we would n’t be surprised if this [ easy ] oil would peak somewhere in the next ten years . ”
Due to a combination of factors including production shortfalls and a declining dollar , oil in May 2008 reached over $ 135 a barrel ( it averaged $ 66 in 2006 and $ 72 in 2007 ) .
The same month Goldman Sachs shocked world capital markets by coming out with an assessment that oil prices could rise to as much as $ 200 a barrel in the next two years .
Western oil interests were particularly distressed that the first production from Kazakhstan ’s Kashagan oil field ( considered the largest oil deposit in the world outside the Middle East ) was eight years behind schedule due in part to waters frozen half the year .
By May 2008 the IEA , according to analysts for the New York Times , was preparing to reduce its forecast of world oil production for 2030 from its earlier forecasts of 116 mb/d to no more than 100 mb/d.30
It was alarm about gasoline prices and national energy security ( and no doubt the specter of a world oil peak ) that induced the Bush administration in 2006 to take a more aggressive stance in promoting corn - based ethanol production as a fuel substitute .
In 2007 , 20 percent of U.S. corn production was devoted to ethanol to fuel automobiles .
The price of grain spiked worldwide partly as a result .
As environmentalist Lester R. Brown wrote in his Plan B 3.0 : “ Suddenly the world is facing a moral and political issue that has no precedent :
Should we use grain to fuel cars or to feed people ?
… The market says , Let ’s fuel the cars . ”
31
The New Energy Imperialism
The response in U.S. national security circles to the apparent oil production plateau , the disappearance of surplus oil production capacity , and growing fears of peak oil was swift .
In October 2005 the CSIS issued another report , this time on Changing Risks in Global Oil Supply and Demand , written by Anthony Cordesmam ( long - time national security analyst for the U.S. Department of Defense , now holder of Arleigh A. Burke Chair in Strategy at CSIS ) and Khalid R. Al - Rodhan ( a strategic analyst specializing in Gulf issues ) .
Cordesman and Al - Rodhan quoted the IEA ’s prediction in its 2004 World Energy Outlook that global oil production would not “ peak before 2030 if the necessary investments are made . ”
Rather the immediate problem was “ lagging investment ” in the Middle East .
Still , peak oil issues were not to be entirely discounted .
Thus Cordesman and Al - Rodhan noted that , “ Some analysts have questioned the [ Saudi ] Kingdom ’s ability to meet sudden surges in demand because of its lack of spare production capacity , and others — like Matthew Simmons — have estimated that Saudi production may be moving towards a period of sustained decline . ”
“ Stability in petroleum exporting regions , ” Cordesman and Al - Rodhan added , “ is tenuous at best .
Algeria , Iran , and Iraq all present immediate security problems , but recent experience has shown that exporting countries in Africa , the Caspian Sea , and South America are no more stable than the Gulf .
There has been pipeline sabotage in Nigeria , labor strikes in Venezuela , alleged corruption in Russia , and civil unrest in Uzbekistan and other FSU [ Former Soviet Union ] states . ”
32
Even more central than the CSIS study was a 2006 Council on Foreign Relations report , chaired by former CIA Director John Deutch and Schlesinger , entitled , National Security Consequences of U.S. Oil Dependency .
The Deutch and Schlesinger report zeroed in on inadequate oil production capacity , with OPEC no longer having the surplus capacity with which to keep prices under control .
Production from existing conventional oil fields throughout the world was “ declining , on average , about 5 percent per year ( roughly 4.3 million barrels per day ) , and thus even sustaining current levels of consumption ” would be enormously difficult .
Moreover , “ the depletion of conventional sources , especially those close to the major markets in the United States , Western Europe , and Asia , means that the production and transport of oil will become even more dependent on an infrastructure that is already vulnerable . ”
Major energy suppliers like Russia , Iran , and Venezuela were using oil to pursue domestic and geopolitical goals , rather than reinvesting the oil proceeds .
Saudi Arabia , Iraq , Iran , and West Africa were all centers of instability .
China was trying to “ lock up ” oil supplies in Africa , the Caspian Sea , and elsewhere .
Although the Deutch and Schlesinger report discussed some demand - side measures to reduce U.S. consumption and oil dependency , it stressed expanding the role of the U.S. military in securing oil supplies .
Thus the report declared that “ the United States should expect and support a strong military posture [ in the Persian Gulf in particular ] that permits suitably rapid deployment to the region , if required …
Any nation ( or subnational group ) that contemplates violence on any scale must take into account the possibility of U.S. preemption , intervention , or retaliation . ”
33
No less significant was an April 2007 “ policy report ” issued by the James A. Baker III Institute for Public Policy on “ The Changing Role of National Oil Companies in International Energy Markets .
” Emphasizing that national oil companies now controlled 77 percent of the world ’s total reserves , whereas Western multinational oil companies controlled a mere 10 percent , it contended that this was the key issue in managing the current world oil supply problem .
“ If the United States were able to wish into existence a world that would favor its terms of trade and superpower status , ” the Baker Institute went so far as to declare ,
all NOCs [ national oil corporations ] would be privatized , foreign investors would be treated the same as local companies and OPEC would be disbanded , allowing free trade and competitive markets to deliver energy that is needed worldwide at prices determined solely by the market .
But it is hard to imagine why major oil producing countries would agree to that ….
In light of this reality , the United States will have to accept the existence of NOCs as a fact of life but should encourage steps to make their activities more businesslike , transparent and — to the extent possible — free of onerous government interference .
Above all the U.S. imperial objective should be to “ break up ” wherever possible “ the monopoly power of oil producers ” and their use of their oil resources to pursue national goals other than purely commercial ones .
The chief example of such state interference in oil production , the Baker Institute report stated , was Venezuela under the leadership of Hugo Chávez .
Not only had the Bolivarian Revolution prioritized “ the government ’s national development policy ” and “ social and cultural investment ” over “ commercial development strategy , ” it had also used oil as an instrument of “ foreign policy activism . ”
This could be seen in its geopolitically motivated agreements with Bolivia , Ecuador , Nicaragua , and the Caribbean nations .
Another case of the geostrategic wielding of oil power was Iran , which had threatened that it “ could block the vital oil transitway , the Strait of Hormuz , ” if faced with a U.S. military attack .
One critical danger that the United States needed to guard against was a “ hostile ” alliance between major oil producing / consuming states , such as Russia , China , Iran , and the Central Asian states .
Another key consideration in the geopolitics of tough oil , the Baker Institute underscored , was the continuing political instability in Iraq .
Despite Washington ’s attempts to stabilize that country , political unrest and war continued , preventing the oil exploration of Iraq ’s Western desert .
34
The tightening oil situation has prompted the rapid on the ground growth of U.S. energy imperialism , beyond the continuing Iraq and Afghan wars .
The security of Saudi Arabia remains an overriding focus .
Washington ’s plans for a massive expansion of investment and production in Saudi Arabia , which according to the U.S. Department of Energy needs to double its oil output by 2030 , depends on the feudal kingdom remaining in place .
Meanwhile , there is rising social tension , emanating from the vastly unequal distribution of the country ’s oil revenues .
Ninety percent of private sector jobs go to foreigners .
The sexes are entirely segregated .
The repressive structure of the society conceals massive popular resentment .
Any destabilization of the society would likely prompt U.S. military intervention .
As James Howard Kunstler has written in The Long Emergency , “ a desperate superpower might feel it has no choice except to attempt to control the largest remaining oil fields on the planet at any cost ” — particularly if faced by growing rivalry from other states .
35
The United States has sought to counter the possibility of an energy alliance between Russia , China , Iran , and Central Asian oil states by expanding its military bases in Afghanistan and Central Asia , notably its Manas air base in Kyrgyzstan on the border of oil - rich Kazakhstan .
Threats of U.S. “ preemptive ” military intervention directed at Iran meanwhile have been continuous , based on its alleged attempts to acquire nuclear weapons through the aggressive pursuit of nuclear energy , and its “ interference ” in Iraq .
Iran ’s pursuit of nuclear power , as a 2007 study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences has confirmed , is due to an oil export decline rate of 10 – 12 percent , arising from the growth of domestic energy demand plus a high rate of oil field depletion and a lack of investment growth in expanded capacity .
This led to Iran ’s recent inability to meet its OPEC oil export quota .
The current trend points to the likelihood of Iranian petroleum exports falling to zero by 2014 – 15 .
From the standpoint of Western energy and national security analysts , Iran ’s government and its national oil corporation have adopted the monopolistic policy of underinvesting in oil , deliberating slowing its production in expectation of continually rising prices , thereby holding back on the lifeblood of the world economy .
36
During the last few years the U.S. military has dramatically increased its bases and operations in Africa , particularly in the Gulf of Guinea .
The United States expects to get 20 percent of its oil imports from Africa by 2010 , and 25 percent by 2015 .
The U.S. military set up a separate Africa Command in 2007 to govern all U.S. military operations in Africa ( outside Egypt ) .
Washington sees itself as in direct competition with Beijing over African oil — a competition that it perceives not simply in economic but also military - strategic terms .37
U.S. ruling interests also have increased their threats directed at Venezuela , Ecuador , Bolivia , and other Latin American states , accusing them of “ resource nationalism ” and presenting them as dangers to U.S. national security .
Washington has made one attempt after another to unseat Venezuela ’s democratically elected president Hugo Chávez and to overthrow Venezuela ’s Bolivarian Revolution , with the clear object of regime change .
This has included stepping up its massive military intervention in Colombia and backing the Colombian military and its intrusions into neighboring countries .
In 2006 the U.S. Southern Command conducted an internal study , declaring that Venezuela , Bolivia , Ecuador , and conceivably even Mexico ( which was then facing elections with a possible populist outcome ) offered serious dangers to U.S. energy security .
“ Pending any favorable changes to the investment climate , ” it declared , “ the prospects for long - term energy production in Venezuela , Ecuador and Mexico are currently at risk . ”
The military threat was obvious .
38
All of this is in accord with the history of capitalism , and the response of declining hegemons to global forces largely outside their control .
The new energy imperialism of the United States is already leading to expanding wars , which could become truly global , as Washington attempts to safeguard the existing capitalist economy and to stave off its own hegemonic decline .
As Simmons has warned , “ If we do n’t create a solution to the enormous potential gap between our inherent demand for energy and the availability of energy we will have the nastiest and last war we ’ll ever fight .
I mean a literal war . ” 39
In January 2008 Carlos Pascual , vice president of the Brookings Institution and former director of the Bush administration ’s Office of Reconstruction and Stabilization , released an analysis of “ The Geopolitics of Energy ” that highlighted U.S. capitalism ’s de facto dependence on oil production in “ Saudi Arabia , Russia , Iran , Iraq , Venezuela , Nigeria , and Kazakhstan ” — all posing major security threats .
“ Due to commercial disputes , local instability , or ideology , Russia , Venezuela , Iran , Nigeria and Iraq are not investing in new long - term production capacity . ”
This then was both an economic and a military problem for Washington .40
Especially disturbing in this new phase of energy imperialism is the lack of resistance from populations within central capitalist countries themselves .
Thus left - liberal publications in the wealthy nations often play on the prejudices of their readers ( who are buffeted by rising gasoline prices ) , encouraging them to support oil imperialism designed to safeguard Western capitalism .
David Litvin , writing on “ Oil , Gas and Imperialism ” in 2006 for the Guardian in London , claimed that “ the inevitability of modern energy imperialism needs to be recognized . ”
Threats from Russia , OPEC , Venezuela , and Bolivia were highlighted .
The United States invaded Iraq , we were told , partly for “ oil security . ”
Clearly sympathizing with that form of energy imperialism that “ involves consumer states launching political or military ” interventions “ to secure supplies , ” Litvin concluded : “ Energy imperialism is here to stay , and efforts should [ therefore ] focus on making it a more benign force . ”
41
Likewise Joshua Kurlantzick , a contributing writer for Mother Jones , wrote a piece entitled “ Put a Tyrant in Your Tank ” for the May–June 2008 issue of that magazine which attributed oil supply problems to national oil companies , and argued — referring to the Baker Institute report on “ The Changing Role of National Oil Companies ” — that oil would be better safeguarded if placed in the hands of multinational oil companies as of old .
The latter , readers were told , “ may cozy up to nasty regimes … but they are at least obligated to respond to public criticism . ”
Kurlantzick presented repeated criticisms of Hugo Chávez in Venezuela for his “ resource nationalism , ” going so far as to compare Venezuela to Burma and Russia , as “ authoritarian and corrupt , ” citing a study from the neoconservative , largely U.S. government - funded , Freedom House .
The Mother Jones article also gave credence to the 2006 internal study conducted by the Pentagon ’s Southern Command , pinpointing the national security dangers to the United States of resource nationalism in Venezuela , Bolivia , and Ecuador .
Other petrostates that were subjected to sharp criticism were Iran , Russia , Kazakhstan , Nigeria , and Libya .
Chinese state oil corporations were targeted for their aggressiveness in pursuing oil around the world and for their lack of environmental concerns .
U.S. energy imperialism was thus seen as justified even by the putatively progressive Mother Jones — with hope and confidence being placed mainly in big oil and the Pentagon.42
Planetary Conflagration ?
The supreme irony of the peak oil crisis of course is that the world is rapidly proceeding down the path of climate change from the burning of fossil fuels , threatening within a matter of decades human civilization and life on the planet .
Unless carbon dioxide emissions from the consumption of such fuels are drastically reduced , a global catastrophe awaits .
For environmentalists peak oil is therefore not a tragedy in itself since the crucial challenge facing humanity at present is weaning the world from excessive dependence on fossil fuels .
The breaking of the solar energy budget that hydrocarbons allowed has generated a biospheric rift , which if not rapidly addressed will close off the future .
43
Yet , heavy levels of fossil fuel , and particularly petroleum , consumption are built into the structure of the present world capitalist economy .
The immediate response of the system to the end of easy oil has been therefore to turn to a new energy imperialism — a strategy of maximum extraction by any means possible : with the object of placating what Rachel Carson once called “ the gods of profit and production . ” 44 This , however , presents the threat of multiple global conflagrations : global warming , peak oil , rapidly rising world hunger ( resulting in part from growing biofuel production ) , and nuclear war — all in order to secure a system geared to growing inequality .
In the face of the immense perils now facing life on the planet , the world desperately needs to take a new direction ; toward communal well - being and global justice : a socialism for the planet .
The immense danger now facing the human species , it should be understood , is not due principally to the constraints of the natural environment , whether geological or climatic , but arises from a deranged social system wheeling out of control , and more specifically , U.S. imperialism .
This is the challenge of our time .

Notes
1. Influential mainstream political analyst ( and former Nixon White House strategist ) Kevin Philips has recently argued that oil in the Middle East and elsewhere has emerged as perhaps the single most important strategic ( non-monetary ) factor in “ the Global Crisis of American Capitalism , ” and is closely tied up with the world ’s need to shift to a “ new energy regime . ”
See Phillips , Bad Money : Reckless Finance , Failed Politics , and the Global Crisis of American Capitalism ( New York : Viking , 2008 ) , 124–27 .
Indeed , the struggle to control world oil can be seen as the centerpiece of the new geopolitics of U.S. empire , designed at the same time to combat the decline of U.S. hegemony .

The central scenario , however , estimated the world oil peak occurring in 2044 , a figure too out of line with all other studies to be considered credible .

In their paper on peak oil and global warming , Kharecha and Hansen present a baseline atmospheric carbon stabailizaton scenario in which oil - based CO2 emissions peak by 2016 , due principally to the “ peaking ” of world oil production ( mediated by economic and social as well as geological factors ) .
If such a peak were to occur , they argue , it would facilitate the stabilization of atmospheric carbon at ( or below ) what scientists increasingly consider to be the maximum safe level of 450 parts per million ( associated with a rise in global average temperature of around 2 °C above pre-industrial ) .
But stabilization of atmospheric CO2 at this level would also require that CO2 emissions from coal - fired power plants peak by 2025 and that coal - fired plants without sequestration be phased out completely “ before mid-century . ”

As a pacifist , I do not condone the use of violence to solve one ’s problems but this topic still intrigues me .
Imagine bombs that do as much damage as TNT but without the environmental impact .
Whether detonated or not TNT ( Trinitrotoluene ) can contaminate the environment .
This compound is used frequently as an explosive because in its standard form it is a solid but it can quickly be converted to a harmful gas .
According to University of Minnesota researchers , solid TNT contaminates the soil and groundwater .
Also , if broken down by water , the chemical can be absorbed directly into the skin causing headaches , anemia and skin irritation .
So , in lieu of the environmental and unintended human safety issues surrounding TNT and similar traditional chemical weapons , German scientists are developing explosives made using tetrazoles .
Tetrazoles are found to be extremely stable and get their explosive power from nitrogen rather than the carbon found in TNT and company .
Two particular tetrazoles , HBT and G2ZT , have been tested in German labs and while they do produce hydrogen cyanide gases researchers have determined that they can mix each with oxidizers to counter the effects and even improve performance of the explosives .
So , is it worth it ?
I really do n’t like the idea of bombs anyway but I suppose that if they continue to be produced then they should be more environmentally conscious .
Spoof news network
The Onion offers a more comical view of the subject with their reader commentary post titled Germans Making ‘ Green Bombs . ’
What do you think of these supposedly more eco-friendly bombs ?

Are razors this expensive these days , that some people have to resort to this kind of practices to remove their facial hair ?
It ’s terrible , if waxing your face was n’t enough , now young teenagers must burn their faces to get the smooth , clean face they desire so much .
Please , if somebody knows this dude , buy him a razor …I ’m buying .
Albert Einstein
He 's certainly got the mad scientist hair thing down .
One of the last century 's most celebrated scientists , Albert Einstein turned physics on its head with his theories of relativity , and made enormous contributions to the fields of gravitation and quantum theory .
He also liked to take his sailboat out on the water on windless days , " just for the challenge . "
Leonardo da Vinci
Between painting the most revered masterpieces of Renaissance art , Leonardo da Vinci somehow still found time to tap into his inner eccentric .
The Italian 's scientific sketchbooks , most written in mirror - image cursive , are a fantasyland of oddball machines and brilliant designs , many which would never come to fruition and some that would be built many centuries later , like his rudimentary helicopter .
Nikola Tesla

This is the guy you picture pulling down a giant electric switch in a shower of fiery sparks .
Tesla , who is credited with the invention of the wireless radio and the AC generator that kick - started the electrical age was even born , fittingly , during a violent lightning storm in 1856 .
He was also known as a manic genius that slept little and loved to put on a good show , often using his own body as a conductor in public demonstrations .
James Lovelock
This modern environmental scientist and inventor of the world - as - superorganism Gaia Hypothesis has been dispensing dire predictions about climate change and our world for decades now , many of which have come true .
He 's not shy about spreading one ultra -gloomy forecast ; given the current ecological crisis , a massive die - off of about 80 percent of humans by 2100 is inevitable , he believes .
Jack Parsons
When Jack Parsons was n't busy co-founding the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , he was practicing magic and calling himself the Antichrist .
This mysterious bad boy of the space program had no formal education , yet still managed to develop a rocket fuel that would guide the United States through WWII and into space .
Tragically yet appropriately dramatic , Parsons blew himself up during a lab experiment at his home in 1952 .
Richard Feynman

Part of the Manhattan Project 's team of geniuses that developed the atomic bomb , physicist Richard Feynman went on to become one of the most important scientists of the late 20th century .
Far from the stuffy professor type , this free spirit explored music and nature , decoded Mayan hieroglyphics and picked locks in his spare time .
Freeman Dyson
( Image credit : Lumidek )
Respected nuclear physicist and prolific writer Freeman Dyson moonlights as a science fiction writer 's dream .
In 1960 , he touted the idea that in the future humans may need to construct an artificial shell , now called the Dyson Sphere , that would encircle the entire solar system and make maximum use of the sun 's energy .
Dyson wholeheartedly believes in extraterrestrial life and thinks we 'll make contact within the next few decades .
Robert Oppenheimer
The Manhattan Project 's head honcho was never reserved about his sympathies for socialism and his conflicted feelings over dropping the atomic bombs , and was ultimately stripped of his academic and political power for it .
Despite those controversies , he 's also remembered as a man his grad students called " Oppie , " who learned Dutch and Sanskrit just because , and quoted a Hindu holy text at the sight of the first atomic bomb test .
Wernher von Braun

At the age of 12 , an intrepid Wernher von Braun loaded his toy wagon with some firecrackers and shot off across a crowded German street .
It was a sign of things to come .
The brains behind Hitler 's V - 2 rocket program arrived in the United States as a prisoner of war and went on to be its champion of space and lunar exploration .
While putting people on the moon , von Braun also mastered scuba diving and philosophy .
Johann Konrad Dippel
Born and raised in Germany 's Castle Frankenstein , 17th - century alchemist Johann Dippel became noted as the inventor of Prussian Blue , one of the first synthetic chemical dyes , but most famous for his endless quest for elixirs of immortality .
Rumors of his experiments on human corpses may have inspired Mary Shelley 's legendary character that bore the castle 's name .
Top - dog firms still rule K Street
Lobbying disclosure second - quarter reports began rolling in on Monday and , well , what they show is that the Democratic takeover of Congress has n’t produced dramatic changes yet .
The same heavyweight firms that reigned during the Republican era remain as the top K Street shops today .
The reports also do n't include new information required by an ethics reform law passed by the new Democratic Congress last year that would shed light on how much fundraising lobbyists do for members of Congress .
The collection of that new data has been delayed by a stalemate between the White House and the Senate over appointments to the Federal Election Commission , which is charged with writing the rules for disclosing the information .

More reports will trickle in over the next few days .
But here ’s a list of the top ten firms compiled Tuesday morning by CQ Money Line and the money they ’ve been paid for lobbying activity in the first six months of this year .
Which debt repayment method is right for you ?
When it comes to repaying debt , you have several options .
Our latest report discusses the pros and cons of each so you can choose the right one for your circumstances .
The application I work on for my employer makes extensive use of modal dialogs in Internet Explorer .
These are a nice feature where you can load a page in a dialog box , and the user cannot access the parent window until the dialog has closed – this includes forward / back buttons , menus , everything .
An issue we have had with supporting Firefox 2 is that it does n’t support modal dialogs .
It seems to have completely been missed by the Firefox 3 fanboys , but Firefox 3 supports modal dialogs .
See my previous post on tips on how to use them .
This is a very very cool thing which I ’m sure many people will find use for .
There are n’t many examples of modal dialog use around , since up until now it was IE - specific , but hopefully it ’ll become much more popular .
The Mozilla team seem to have simply copied the window .
showModalDialog function exactly from Microsoft , so any code previously used to open modals in IE works just fine in FireFox 3 .
You ’ve got to love open source : out - innovating the proprietary guys 99 % of the time , then copying whatever you missed 🙂
Update : I ’ve confirmed that in FireFox 3 modal dialogs , unlike in IE , when you click a hyperlink the resulting page will correctly open in the dialog , and NOT open a new window .
This makes them infinitely more useful , and should negate the need for the horrendous hacks that IE forces on people .
Google
Test is portable : it works on a variety of platforms ( Linux , Windows , Mac OS X , and more ) , with several versions of GCC and MSVC compilers , and with or without exceptions .
You can even use it in embedded systems like Windows CE and Symbian .
Build tools and test runners for many of these are under active development , with Linux Autotools support already in place .
It supports both fatal and nonfatal assertions .
The test will continue after a nonfatal failure .
This allows more problems to be uncovered and fixed in a single edit - compile - test cycle .
It provides many assertions for common testing needs , and lets you easily define new assertions for less common cases .
On Linux , you can write death tests to ensure that your code crashes with expected errors .
Because it 's based on the popular xUnit architecture , Google Test is easy to learn if you 've used any testing framework in this family before .
We hope this list can help you decide whether [ Google Test is useful ] for you too : Google Test is designed to be portable .
It works where many STL types ( e.g. std :: string and std::vector ) do n't compile .
It does n't require exceptions or RTTI .
As a result , it runs on Linux , Mac OS X , Windows and several embedded operating systems .
Nonfatal assertions ( EXPECT _* ) have proven to be great time savers , as they allow a test to report multiple failures in a single edit - compile - test cycle .
It 's easy to write assertions that generate informative messages : you just use the stream syntax to append any additional information , e.g. ASSERT_EQ ( 5 , Foo(i ) ) << " where i = " << i ; .
It does n't require a new set of macros or special functions .
Google
Test automatically detects your tests and does n't require you to enumerate them in order to run them .
No framework can anticipate all your needs , so Google Test provides EXPECT_PRED * to make it easy to extend your assertion vocabulary .
For a nicer syntax , you can define your own assertion macros trivially in terms of EXPECT_PRED *.
Death tests are pretty handy for ensuring that your asserts in production code are triggered by the right conditions .
SCOPED_TRACE helps you understand the context of an assertion failure when it comes from inside a sub-routine or loop .
You can decide which tests to run using name patterns .
This saves time when you want to quickly reproduce a test failure .
Another excellent thing about the framework was that it ’s easy to learn the basics as well has advanced features .
Its very similar to xUnit tests and has good features to compare with CppUnit .
The basics can be learnt from here and the advanced guide is here .
Predicate Assertions are probably one of my favorite features , that we encountered quickly in a program that we were having trouble to debug .
There are also a host of other assertions available and we ’ve not got into very deep with all the assertions .
But from the initial look at the framework , most of us very ranking it as one of the best testing frameworks out there ...
The folks at Google have recently open - sourced their xUnit - based testing framework for C++ development .
The framework is said by project developer Zhanyong Wan to have been in use internally at Google for years by thousands of their C++ developers .
According to Google the primary highlights of this release are : While the C++ community has always been in agreement that their toolset for good unit testing does not live up to that offered for other modern languages , such as Java and C# , many are still sure to ask , " Why another toolset ?
What 's special ? " .
On the Faqs portion of their wiki , Googlers attempt to address this question and many others .
They caveat that they are not claiming their toolset to be " better " per se than existing tools , but rather just offering a different combination of functionality that they at Google have found useful for their needs .
From the site : Saptarshi " Sunny " Purkayastha spent some time checking the new framework out and posted his initial thoughts on his blog .
His reaction was positive : According to the wiki , you can get up and running with Google Test by checking out their Primer , and then referencing the Advanced Guide for more intensive use .
Download the framework here , try it out , and let the community know what you think !
News in Science reports :
Scientists have photographed a giant gas bubble emanating from a whale , suggesting that flatulence is just as common for ocean mammals as it is for humans and many other terrestrial animals .
The picture , released last week by scientists from the Australian Antarctic Division ( AAD ) in Tasmania , was taken by the captain of a U.S. research ship the Nathaniel B. Palmer , while on expedition between Marguerite Bay and Palmer Station , Antarctica .
" The picture is of an Antarctic minke whale taken from the bow of a ship , " said AAD principal research scientist Dr Nick Gales .
" The white bits in the photo are pieces of ice - floe , the stream of pinky colour behind the whale is a faecal plume - a .k.a. " poo " - the large circle in the water is indeed the physical eruption of the whale 's flatulence . "

The Lunar Crater Observation and Sensing Satellite ( LCROSS ) is a very exciting mission for lunar exploration .
Since the discovery of water on Mars by Phoenix last week , focus is turning on other planetary bodies and natural satellites for the possibility they may hold a supply of water too .
First stop for any manned mission will be our return trip to the Moon by 2020 , so it would be very advantageous if we could find a frozen reservoir of H 2 O hiding within the craters of the lunar surface .
LCROSS is going to hitch a ride with the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) later this year on board an Atlas V rocket .
It has just passed some gruelling pre-launch tests before it sets out on a suicide mission that will end in collision with the lunar surface …
To make sure LCROSS can stand up to the huge temperature gradients it will experience during its lunar adventure , engineers have subjected it to rigorous heating and cooling cycles at the Northrop Grumman facility in Redondo Beach , California .
These tests come after successful completion of thermal vacuum testing at the start of this month .
LCROSS has also been given the thumbs up after passing a launch acoustic vibration simulation intended to see how the integrity of the spacecraft copes with the violence of an Atlas V blast - off .
This new round of tests heated the spacecraft to 230 °F ( 110°C ) and then cooled it to - 40 °F ( - 40 °C ) over 13.5 days to simulate the extremes of temperature it will experience en-route to the Moon and flyby .
“ The spacecraft steadily has taken shape since Ames delivered the science payload in January .
It is a testament to the hard work , perseverance and expertise of the NASA and Northrop Grumman teams that the spacecraft has completed these critical tests ahead of schedule . ”
– Daniel Andrews , LCROSS project manager , NASA ’s Ames Research Center , California .
When in orbit around the Moon in 2009 , LCROSS will create two impact plumes in the lunar surface .
The target will be a crater near the lunar polar region that is constantly in shadow .
This is the perfect location for water ice to form , if there ’s any at all .
The Atlas V’s Centaur upper stage rocket will carry LCROSS to the Moon and execute a lunar flyby .
It will then enter an elongated Earth orbit , putting the probe in the correct trajectory , ready for LCROSS - Centaur separation .
The Centaur stage will then be instructed to carry out a suicidal plunge into the surface so the resulting plume of dust and gas that will rise into the orbital path for LCROSS to analyse .
Once data about the plume is relayed to Earth , LCROSS itself will make the ultimate sacrifice , ploughing into the Moon ’s surface , creating a second plume of debris for Earth - based observatories to analyse .
It is hoped this trailblazer mission will unlock some of the lunar secrets as to whether water ice is present in any great quantities inside this polar crater , possibly the source for a future manned lunar base .

Via Andrew Sullivan new research on the neurobiology of sexual orientation :
The scans reveal that in gay people , key structures of the brain governing emotion , mood , anxiety and aggressiveness resemble those in straight people of the opposite sex .
The differences are likely to have been forged in the womb or in early infancy , says Ivanka Savic , who conducted the study at the Karolinska Institute in Stockholm , Sweden .
" This is the most robust measure so far of cerebral differences between homosexual and heterosexual subjects , " she says .
Previous studies have also shown differences in brain architecture and activity between gay and straight people , but most relied on people 's responses to sexuality driven cues that could have been learned , such as rating the attractiveness of male or female faces .
To get round this , Savic and her colleague , Per Lindström , chose to measure brain parameters likely to have been fixed at birth .
" That was the whole point of the study , to show parameters that differ , but which could n't be altered by learning or cognitive processes , " says Savic .
Liberals tend to believe that sexual orientation is determined by genetics but that gender - difference in behavior is not , whereas conservatives tend to believe the reverse .
But , of course , as we see here these are related issues .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Total was reportedly the last major western energy firm interested in Iran
The head of French energy giant Total has said it will not invest in Iran because it is too politically risky .
The company had been planning to develop the huge South Pars gas field , but Christophe de Margerie says this will not now go ahead .
The announcement comes a day after Iran test - fired a series of missiles amid weeks of rising tensions with Israel and the US over its nuclear ambitions .
Analysts say Total 's move will be a big blow to the Iranian energy industry .
It means Iran is now unlikely to significantly increase its gas exports until late into the next decade , they add .
In further response to the test missiles , US Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice said on Thursday that Washington would defend the interests of America and those of its allies from attacks by Iran .
Sanctions Total has a memorandum of understanding with the state - owned National Iranian Oil Company to develop Phase 11 of Iran 's half of the South Pars field in the Gulf .
Today we would be taking too much political risk to invest in Iran because people will say : ' Total will do anything for money '
Christophe de Margerie
Chief Executive , Total
What now for Iran 's gas reserves ?
Send us your comments
In May , Total said it was still interested in working on the project together with the Malaysian company , Petronas .
But Mr de Margerie 's comments now cast serious doubt on whether the French firm will invest in the Islamic Republic in the near future .
" Today we would be taking too much political risk to invest in Iran because people will say : ' Total will do anything for money ' , " he told the Finacial Times .
And later he told the France 24 television station : " It is probably necessary that things get better , that Iran can again have better relations with its neighbours and the rest of the countries that today have a harsh stance towards it . "
The remarks follow increasing tension between Iran and Israel over Tehran 's nuclear programme .
Iran has the second biggest gas reserves after Russia The US has also recently stepped up the pressure to impose tougher sanctions on the Iranian government and companies that do business with it .
Total was the last major Western energy group to have seriously considered investing in the country 's huge gas reserves .
It was also one of the few companies in the world to have the technology needed to exploit Iran 's huge , but untapped gas reserves .
The BBC's Jon Leyne in Tehran says it has been particularly galling for Tehran to watch as Qatar pumps vast amounts of gas from the South Pars field to its side of the Gulf , helping it become one of the world 's major energy suppliers .
But observers say it is not just sanctions or political pressure - international banks simply are not prepared to put up the billions of dollars needed for such investments in Iran .
' Provocative ' missile test Mr de Margerie 's remarks come a day after state media reported that the Iranian Revolutionary Guards test - fired a updated version of the Shahab - 3 missile , said to have a range of 2,000 km ( 1,240 miles ) .
Gen Hoseyn Salami , the Guards ' air force commander , said the tests demonstrated Iran 's " resolve and might against enemies who in recent weeks have threatened Iran with harsh language " .
State media quoted him as saying : " Our hands are always on the trigger and our missiles are ready for launch . "
Tehran has tested the Shahab - 3 before , but the latest launch comes amid rising tensions in the region .
William Burns , the top official handling Iranian issues at the US state department , said the launch was " very disturbing , provocative and reckless " .
But US officials played down suggestions that the move had brought military confrontation with Iran any closer .
" The reality is there is a lot of signalling going on , but everybody recognises what the consequences of any kind of a conflict would be , " said Defence Secretary Robert Gates .

What are these ?
THE AMERICAN Automobile Association reported last week that summer gasoline prices may have peaked  news that will be particularly welcome if it takes the steam out of two wrong - headed energy proposals from Washington .
Democrats have rallied around a plan to raid the Strategic Petroleum Reserve , while the Bush administration has proposed a special rule to spur exploitation of oil shale in the West , a petroleum source that requires large quantities of water and energy to develop and will not be commercially viable for years , if ever .
The energy proposal before Congress that does deserve support is the extension of expiring tax credits for renewable energy and energy efficiency projects .
The plan to tap 10 percent of the petroleum reserve , sponsored by Representative Edward Markey of Massachusetts , failed to get the two - thirds majority it needed , but it is likely to come back .
The Bush administration is right to oppose it , since the purpose of the reserve is to keep oil flowing in the event of a terrorist attack , war , or natural catastrophe , not to put a damper on the pump price of gasoline .
The Bush administrations own most recent attempt to fool the public into thinking it has an answer to the energy crunch is its proposal to offer sweetheart leases for developers of oil shale in the West .
According to the Interior Department , the West has an estimated 800 billion barrels of oil in underground shale formations  three times the proven reserves of Saudi Arabia .
But getting the oil out requires cooking the oil out of the rock and then pumping it to the surface .
Senator Ken Salazar of Colorado has called the lease proposal a last - minute fire sale and said the nation is years away from knowing if the technologies for developing oil shale on a commercial scale are even viable .
Much of the water for oil - shale development would have to come from the depleted Colorado River basin .
Getting oil from shale produces far more greenhouse gases than the extraction of conventional petroleum .
Congress  2005 energy bill funded studies on oil shale development , but until a way can be found to extract the oil without adding to global warming , worsening the Wests water shortage , and blighting the landscape , any proposal to offer leases at bargain rates is woefully premature .
In the meantime , Congress could ensure new energy production without greenhouse gases by ending the uncertainty surrounding the tax credits for solar , wind , and other renewable sources .
Investors need a signal that the credits will not run out .
Congress should give a green light to green energy .

Gentlemen , this is a problem so many of us have experienced :
How to ask a young lady if she likes it in the pooper .
From my personal experience , if you simply ask your date ( particularly if it's a first date ) , you 're most likely going to be met with , at best , nervous giggles , and at worst , a steely gaze followed by a request to be let off the back of your bicycle .
Why is this ?
I believe it 's because " society " frowns upon this form of intercourse , even though 9 out of 10 women prefer it .
( Like most other facts in my book , I just made that up . )
Why do I put " society " in quotation marks ?
Because what is " society ? "
It 's you and me , and the only way we are going to change " society " is by taking an active role in dispensing with the embarrassment and shame of putting your wiener in some chick 's butt .

How do we do this ?
As loving men , how do we approach the sensitive question : Anal ?
There are a couple of different methods .
The most common is what I call " the accidental method . "
Simply put , you wait until you are about to have intercourse .
Then , you " accidentally " put it in her rear end .
When she says , " That 's the wrong hole , " you say , " There 's nothing wrong about it . "
From that point , it should be obvious how she wants you to proceed .
I do n't recommend this approach because it catches the lady off guard and , if for some reason , she does not want to proceed in the prescribed manner , it necessitates you either cleaning yourself off or " double dipping , " which is not a good idea for hygienic reasons .

Another approach is the " finger twaddle . "
I call it that because " twaddle " is a very funny word .
This is a multi-stage process .
First , during foreplay , spend some time fondling her tush .
If she responds positively , insert your pointer finger , a maneuver I call " the twaddle . "
Twaddle around in there a little .
She likey ?
Great .
Now , as you twaddle , whisper the following in her ear .
" Roll over , baby . "
The rest should take care of itself .
Maybe you 're one of those guys who likes to lay down the rules of the road before the evening progresses to coitus .
As I mentioned before , simply posing the question in a straightforward manner rarely achieves the desired result .
Instead , try asking in an indirect way .

Perhaps you 've just enjoyed a romantic dinner together ( I suggest Red Lobster ) .
The evening is going well , and you suspect the two of you might end up in bed together later in the evening .
Great .
Here 's what you do : Order dessert .
( If you take my suggestion of Red Lobster , I further suggest " The Chocolate Wave . " )
When your Chocolate Wave arrives , spoon some of that gooey concoction into her mouth , and say , " I wish this gooey concoction was my wang , and I wish your mouth was your butt . "
If she says , " I wish that , too , " you 'll know where you stand .
If she says , " That 's disgusting , " you can easily say , " I was just kidding . "
Or , less convincingly , you could try , " I think you misunderstood me . "
But that 's not the kind of thing that 's easily misunderstood .

If this is still too direct , take her on a long walk through a nature conservancy or arboretum .
While strolling among the flora and fauna , take her hand in yours and say something like , " I 'm having a great time .
I 'd like to know everything about you . "
Women love to hear that .
Next , ask her a series of utterly meaningless questions : " What are your hopes and dreams ? "
" Have you ever been in love ? "

It was a fortuitous typo for the Fred Meyer retail chain .
This spring , an employee intending to order a special CD - DVD edition of R.E.M.'s latest release “ Accelerate ” inadvertently entered the “ LP ” code instead .
Soon boxes of vinyl discs showed up at several stores .
Some sent them back .
But a handful put them on the shelves , and 20 LPs sold the first day .
The Portland - based company , owned by the Kroger Co. , realized the error might not be so bad after all .
Fred Meyer is now testing vinyl sales at 60 of its stores in Oregon , Washington and Alaska .
The company says it plans to roll out vinyl in July in all its stores that sell music .

Other retailers are giving vinyl a spin too .
Best Buy Co. is testing sales at some stores .
And Amazon.com Inc. , which has sold vinyl for most of the 13 years it has been in business online , created a special vinyl - only section last fall .
The bestseller so far at Fred Meyer is The Beatles album “ Abbey Road . ”
But bands including the White Stripes , the Foo Fighters , Metallica and Pink Floyd are selling well , the company says .
“ It ’s not just a nostalgia thing , ” said Melinda Merrill , spokeswoman for Fred Meyer .
“ The response from customers has just been that they like it , they feel like it has a better sound . ”
According to the Recording Industry Assn. of America , manufacturers ’ shipments of LPs jumped more than 36 % from 2006 to 2007 to more than 1.3 million .
Shipments of CDs dropped more than 17 % during the same period to 511 million , as they lost some ground to digital formats .

The resurgence of vinyl centers on a long - standing debate over analog versus digital sound .
Digital recordings capture samples of sound and place them very close together as a complete package that sounds nearly identical to continuous sound to many people .
Analog recordings on most LPs are continuous , which produces a truer sound -- though , paradoxically , some new LP releases are being recorded and mixed digitally but delivered analog .
Some purists also argue that the compression required to allow loudness in some digital formats weakens the quality .
But it ’s not just about the sound .
Audiophiles say they also want the format ’s overall experience -- the sensory experience of putting the needle on the record , the feeling of side A and side B and the joy of lingering over the liner notes .
“ I think music products should be more than just music , ” said Isaac Hudson , a 28 - year - old vinyl fan in Portland .

The interest seems to be catching on .
Turntable sales are picking up , and the few remaining record pressers say business is booming .
But the LP is n’t going to muscle out CDs or iPod soon .
Nearly 450 million CDs were sold in 2007 , versus just under 1 million LPs , according to Nielsen SoundScan .
Nielsen says vinyl album sales could reach 1.6 million this year .

Engineers at the University of Kitakyushu have developed an underwater survey robot that looks good enough to eat .
" Tai - robot - kun , " a 7 - kilogram ( 15.4 lb ) robotic sea bream ( red snapper ) with a silicone body covered in realistically hand - painted scales , features a unique propulsion system that allows it to move its tail and drift silently through the water like a real fish .
( Watch a video . )
The robotic fish can swim for an hour on a full battery charge , and it relies on a ballast system similar to those used in submarines to adjust its buoyancy and depth .
Tai - robot - kun 's creator , professor Ikuo Yamamoto , says the robot can easily be mass - produced , outfitted with various cameras and sensors , and released into the sea to perform a wide range of oceanographic survey tasks .
He adds that because the robot swims silently and looks like a real fish , it would be able to gather data without alarming the creatures it encounters .
Yamamoto and his team are also reportedly developing a robotic manta ray that uses some of the same technology .

The democratization of information , where the barrier to entry is often only an Internet connection , has seen some interesting ideas about how to best educate the public about complex issues such as climate change .
One of the standout efforts has to be Google Earth .
More and more individual scientists , research projects , and institutes are making their data available to the public in the form of Google Earth overlays , that demonstrate vividly their findings .
The UK's Met Office Hadley Centre and the British Antarctic Survey are teaming up with Google Earth to better inform the public about their work on climate modeling .
It might be simplistic and oft - repeated , but the impact of information technology on science has been immense .
Analysis of data that would involve lengthy calculations , statistical tables , and slide rules can now be done in a flash thanks to applications .
The Internet has brought the world 's libraries into every office and lab , and the power of today 's computers allows for complex simulation such as modeling protein - drug interaction or analyzing huge data sets like DNA arrays or radio telescope data .
But technology has just as important a role to play in disseminating that research to its owners , the general public .
Scientific R&D is publicly funded across the globe as a public good , but that means little if the people paying the bill do n't understand the work or see how they might benefit from it .
Google , the Internet search and advertising behemoth , has been quite active in using both its technology and its philanthropic arm in support of a number of worthy causes , and climate change is one that Google Earth is well suited to .
The Met[eorological ]
Office Hadley Centre has developed a KML file that dynamically demonstrates its climate modeling projections over the century , so the curious among you can see what kind of climate changes your children and grandchildren can expect .
The overlay also contains points of interest that describe specific regional impacts , or explain how the data were calculated .
The British Antarctic Survey 's overlay file concentrates on Antarctica , as one might expect .
It contains multiple entries , along with some stunning images , showing the extent of the ice retreat on this frozen continent .
It 's not just researchers that are using Google Earth in the fight against climate change .
Private industry is getting in on the effort too .
The public is ( slowly ) starting to get interested in the idea of incorporating renewable energy into existing or proposed buildings , and a Seattle - based company called 3 Tier has used Google Earth technology , in concert with an office full of PhDs , to create Firstlook , a tool for determining the best choice of renewable wind or solar for a given location .
The push towards individual businesses and homeowners installing renewable energy devices is going to grow over the next few years as the impact of climate change starts to sink in .
But according to James Woolsey , former CIA Director , it makes sense on a national security level too .
I had the opportunity to see Woolsey speak at the recent AAAS Science and Technology forum , where he brought attention to the frailty of the power infrastructure of the US , as outlined in a recent National Academies report .
Woolsey argued that even from just a security outlook , having buildings generate their some of their own electricity ( as currently happens in Germany or Denmark ) is just good sense .
When you take into account climate change , it starts to become an urgent priority .
Bush administration settles Hatfill suit , buries anthrax investigation
By Patrick Martin
3 July 2008
The Bush administration agreed June 27 to pay nearly $ 6 million to biological - weapons expert Steven J. Hatfill in return for ending a lawsuit against the Justice Department .
Hatfill filed the suit after top government officials named him a “ person of interest ” in the FBI investigation into the anthrax attacks that killed five people and spread panic in the wake of the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 .
The agreement does not free the scientist of suspicion , although it makes it highly unlikely that he could ever be prosecuted if he actually had any connection to the attacks .
The Department of Justice admitted no liability in relation to Hatfill , and a spokesman said that the settlement was agreed “ in the best interests of the United States . ”
Hatfill was the subject of intense media attention for more than a year , and was fired from a job at Louisiana State University because of FBI pressure .
He will receive a lump - sum payment of $ 2.825 million , as well as an annuity that will pay him another $ 3 million , or $ 150,000 a year over the next 20 years .
One consequence of the deal is that the ongoing federal case against former USA Today journalist Toni Locy is likely to be quashed .
Locy was subpoenaed by Hatfill ’s attorneys , who demanded to know the sources for several articles she had written about the case .
Locy refused to comply , citing journalistic confidentiality , but was facing $ 5,000 per day fines imposed by US District Judge Reggie Walton .
The fines were stayed while Locy ’s appeal worked its way through the courts .
Hatfill also sued the New York Times and columnist Nicholas Kristof , who wrote extensively on the case in 2002 and was the first to report Hatfill ’s identity , but that case was thrown out by the courts last year .
Judge Walton has been increasingly critical of the government case against Hatfill , declaring at a hearing earlier this year , after he had reviewed still - secret internal FBI memos about the anthrax investigation , “ There is not a scintilla of evidence that would indicate that Dr. Hatfill had anything to do with this . ”
One of Hatfill ’s lawyers , Mark Grannis , told the press , “ The good news is that we still live in a country where a guy who ’s been horribly abused can go to a judge and say ‘ I need your help , ’ and maybe it takes a while , but he gets justice . ”
Actually , the United States is not such a country .
The cash windfall for the former “ person of interest ” is in sharp contrast to the treatment the Bush administration routinely deals out to terrorism suspects who are not , like Hatfill , veterans of Green Beret training with ultra- right political associations and reported connections to US intelligence services .
If Hatfill had been a Muslim or an immigrant from the Middle East , he would have been arrested , imprisoned in solitary confinement , and denied access to a lawyer or to the media .
Instead , he walks away with one of the biggest financial awards ever issued for government misconduct .
The US government has not paid a dime in compensation to innocent victims of the CIA ’s rendition program , like Khaled al - Masri , a German citizen of Kuwaiti descent who was kidnapped by the CIA while on vacation in Macedonia , shipped to Afghanistan , abused for five months , then released when the agency realized it had seized the wrong man .
Nor has anything been paid to Maher Arar , a Canadian citizen of Syrian origin , grabbed at Kennedy International Airport while changing planes , transported to Syria and tortured there for months , also eventually released without any charges against him .
Instead of paying them millions of dollars , the Bush administration invoked the “ state secrets ” privilege to bar either victim from suing in US courts over their kidnapping , illegal imprisonment and torture .
Then there is the example of Ali Marri , a Qatari national and US resident , studying at Bradley University in Peoria , Illinois , where he lived with his wife and five children .
Marri has been held in a Navy brig in Charleston , South Carolina since 2003 on unspecified terrorism charges .
The Bush administration maintains that it has the power to seize an immigrant living legally in the United States , and hold him indefinitely in a military prison without any legal recourse whatsoever .
All three cases have one thing in common : there is far less evidence against any of the prisoners , one still held by the US government , than there was against Hatfill , who was never arrested and has not spent a single day behind bars .
The anthrax investigation is reputedly one of the largest and most wide - ranging ever conducted by the FBI , with thousands of interviews and inquiries , dozens of searches , and zero progress .
The dead end is all the more remarkable because independent scientific experts have maintained that the anthrax used in the deadly mailings in the fall of 2001 could only have been obtained by someone with biological warfare expertise and access to US biological weapons testing facilities , particularly the lab at Ft. Detrick , Maryland , where Hatfill once worked .
The universe of possible suspects has been estimated at between 20 and 250 people .
Hatfill came to the attention of the Justice Department , and ultimately of the media , because of several curious facts in his career .
After US military service , he attended the University of Zimbabwe when the country was still under white minority rule , taking a medical degree .
Kristof raised some logical questions in his New York Times column in 2002 , where he referred to Hatfill as “ Mr. Z. ”
He wrote ( in the form of questions to the government investigators ) : “ Have you examined whether Mr. Z. has connections to the biggest anthrax outbreak among humans ever recorded , the one that sickened more than 10,000 black farmers in Zimbabwe in 1978 - 80 ?
There is evidence that the anthrax was released by the white Rhodesian Army fighting against black guerrillas , and Mr. Z. has claimed that he participated in the white army ’s much - feared Selous Scouts .
Could rogue elements of the American military have backed the Rhodesian Army in anthrax and cholera attacks against blacks ?
Mr. Z ’s resume also claims involvement in the former South African Defense Force ; all else aside , who knew that the US Defense Department would pick an American who had served in the armed forces of two white - racist regimes to work in the American biodefense program with some of the world ’s deadliest germs ? ”
While in Zimbabwe , moreover , Hatfill had lived near a Greendale School , the fake return address used in the anthrax mailings to Congress .
He had a grievance against the government because the Pentagon had revoked his security clearance on August 23 , 2001 , and he was later fired from his job at a defense contractor as a result .
Investigators also discovered that Hatfill had penned an unpublished novel that centers on a lone terrorist attacking Congress using plague bacteria .
These may just be strange coincidences , but they are many .
Even more significant is the evident right - wing political motivation behind the anthrax attacks .
They served two purposes : in general , to spread fear and panic after the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 ; and in particular , to intimidate the leadership of the Democratic Party in Congress , and sections of media demonized by the far - right as “ liberal , ” such as NBC News .
The mailings went to the offices of Senate Majority Leader Tom Daschle and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy , as well as to the office of NBC anchorman Tom Brokaw , and to the company that owns the National Enquirer tabloid .
As the WSWS wrote at the time , after the source of the anthrax was positively identified : “ The Democratic Party leadership was targeted for assassination using weapons produced by ( or stolen from ) the American military itself .
The whole affair exudes the stench of an attempted political coup . ”
Sections of the ultra - right media , particularly the Wall Street Journal , sought to dismiss the significance of the targeting of congressional Democrats , claiming that the FBI was mistaken in concluding that the attack was of domestic origins and suggesting that Al Qaeda or Saddam Hussein were responsible .
The Journal continues to take this line today , depicting the payoff to Hatfill as a vindication of its initial criticism .
The Journal makes no mention of another curious fact , uncovered by the right - wing Judicial Watch group , in the course of a Freedom of Information Act suit against the Bush administration : the White House staff were all issued tablets of Cipro , which protects against anthrax , on September 11 , 2001 — more than three weeks before the first mailings arrived in Florida and on Capitol Hill .
Larry Klayman of Judicial Watch declared , in a press statement , “ We believe that the White House knew or had reason to know that an anthrax attack was imminent or underway . ”
Not only the investigation into the anthrax attacks , but the settlement with Hatfill itself has a politically compromised character .
Besides ensuring that the former military bioweapons expert has an incentive to keep silent on whatever he may know about the 2001 events , the payoff may be an effort to dispose of the case before a change of administration in Washington .
Former senator Daschle , one of the main targets of the anthrax mailings , is a leading figure in the Obama campaign , and many of his former staffers , including those who were in the office the day the anthrax letter arrived , could take key positions in an Obama administration .
Despite the spineless response of the Democratic leadership on the entire range of political issues summed up in the label “ war on terror , ” there are undoubtedly those in the Bush White House who are nervous about allowing the anthrax case to carry over to a new administration in which former targets of the attacks play a significant role .
Gary McKinnon could face a long prison sentence A Briton accused of hacking into top secret military computers has lost a Law Lords appeal against being extradited to stand trial in the US .
Glasgow - born Gary McKinnon could face life in jail if convicted of accessing 97 US military and Nasa computers .
He has admitted breaking into the computers from his London home but said he was seeking information on UFOs .
The 42 - year - old 's lawyers said they would apply to the European Court of Human Rights to prevent his removal .

Mr McKinnon first lost his case at the High Court in 2006 before taking it to the highest court in the UK , the House of Lords .
He was arrested in 2002 but never charged in the UK .
The US government claims he committed a malicious crime - the biggest military computer hack ever .
The authorities have warned that without his co-operation and a guilty plea the case could be treated as terrorism and he could face a long jail sentence .
A statement by solicitors for McKinnon , who was not at the Lords to hear the judgement , said : " Gary McKinnon is neither a terrorist nor a terrorist sympathiser .
" His case could have been properly dealt with by our own prosecuting authorities .
We believe that the British government declined to prosecute him to enable the US government to make an example of him .
" American officials involved in this case have stated that they want to see him ' fry ' .
" The consequences he faces if extradited are both disproportionate and intolerable . "
' Computer nerd '
Their client is accused of hacking into the computers with the intention of intimidating the US government .
It alleges that between February 2001 and March 2002 , he hacked into dozens of US Army , Navy , Air Force , and Department of Defense computers , as well as 16 Nasa computers . .
American officials involved in this case have stated that they want to see him ' fry '
Gary McKinnon 's lawyers Prosecutors say he altered and deleted files at a naval air station not long after the 11 September attacks in 2001 , rendering critical systems inoperable .
Mr McKinnon , who is unemployed , has admitted that he accessed computers in the US without authority .
But he has said he is merely a computer nerd , whose motives were harmless and innocent .
He denies any attempts at sabotage .
He said he wanted to find evidence of UFOs he thought was being held by the US authorities , and to expose what he believed was a cover - up .
Repatriated The Law Lords were told by Mr McKinnon 's lawyers that extraditing him would be an abuse of proceedings .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
US authorities had threatened him with a long jail sentence if he did not plead guilty , they said .
If the case was treated as terrorism it could result in a sentence of up to 60 years in a maximum security prison , should he be found guilty on all six indictments .
With co-operation , he would receive a lesser sentence of 37 to 46 months and be repatriated to the UK , where he could be released on parole and charges of " significantly damaging national security " would be dropped .
But Clare Montgomery QC , representing the home secretary , argued no threats were made , and the extradition should go ahead .

Critical Links to Lamaism
Not unlike other religions Buddhism also has “ skeletons in its ’ closet ” which it carefully conceals in the Western world .
There are dark aspects in this “ philosophy of compassion , non-violence and tolerance ” .
Zen-Buddhism for example influenced the most sophisticated warrior philosophy of the East : the extremely brutal and suicidal Samurai Ethics .
In Tibetan Buddhism one can find believes in spirits and demons , in secret sexual practices , in war gods , in occultism .
Lamas search to influence their retinue and the world with all sorts of magical rituals .
In Sri Lanka Buddhist violence and Buddhist racism are the order of the day .
In Burma and in Kashmir Buddhist armies are fighting .
And yet the Dalai Lama has another face that peeks out from behind the mask of goodness , charity and kindness , which gives one pause to think more deeply about the shadow sides of this “ man of peace . ”
Why is Buddhist fundamentalism so dangerous - because it shows a tendency to religious Fascism !
It ’s not well known that the brain trust of the SS in Nazi Germany was extremely interested in Vedic - and Buddhist - teachings , in the Lamaist culture , and in Zen-Meditation with the goal to construct with elements of these eastern believes its own Nazi-Religion .
( See : www.trimondi.de/H-B-K/inhalt.hi.en.htm )
Buddhism - if it will become congruent with western values like democracy , human rights , equality of gender etc. must be “ reinvented ” .
The condition therefore is an open , critical and honest debate .
In the old version of this site ( Critical Links to Buddhism and Lamaism ) we did refer to articles concerning different Buddhist schools ( Theravada , Zen , Chan .... ) .
Now we will concentrate only on contributions to Lamaism .
Since this site was published ( 2005 ) the critical debate on Tibetan Buddhism has more and more expanded .
The internet is full of hundreds of unbiased analyses , discussions and reports about the history of Tibet , the Dalai Lama and Buddhist Tantrism .
In Youtube one can find a lot of impressive documentary material .
Although several of these films are escorted by Chinese propaganda the historical documents speak their own unadorned language .
The time Tibetan Buddhism could argue that in difference to other religions it has been always peaceful , compassionate and non-violent is over .

The misuse of Western Terms by Eastern Mystics
www.american-buddha.com/misuse.west.terms.htm
The American Family Association , a powerful Christian group , has emerged as a key player pressuring Heinz to pull its Deli Mayo commercial featuring two men kissing – even though it was never broadcast on US TV .
Heinz 's US HQ was flooded with emails complaining about the Deli Mayo ad , which was only broadcast in the UK , after the AFA found out about it via the internet and mobilised its 3.5 million members .
The AFA , which says it stands for " traditional family values " and targets the " influence of television and other media " on society , sent an email " action alert " to its 3.5 million subscribers denouncing the Heinz Deli Mayo commercial as the " kind of ad we can expect to see in California as they prepare to vote on homosexual marriage " .
" I thought you might be interested in seeing the Heinz ad featuring a homosexual family and two homosexuals kissing , " said the email action alert .
" We suggest you forward this to all your family and friends letting them know of the push for homosexual marriage by Heinz .
This ad is currently running in England , but no doubt can be expected in the US soon . "
The action alert , sent out on June 24 , included the phone numbers of Heinz 's US corporate headquarters and an email letter of complaint for subscribers to support .
Cindy Roberts , the director of media and public relations at the AFA , told MediaGuardian.co.uk that after the alert was sent out Heinz US called to let the organisation know the ad would not run again .
Roberts said Heinz had admitted that the volume of AFA members ' email complaints had " bogged the [ computer ] system down " .
The AFA alert was sent out a day after MediaGuardian .
co.uk revealed that about 200 viewers had complained about the ad to UK's Advertising Standards Authority .
Heinz UK said it actually pulled the ad on Friday June 20 , several days before the AFA got involved .
But Heinz UK only put out an official statement on Monday last week , June 23 , saying it had taken the decision to pull the campaign because " some consumers raised concerns over the content of the ad " .
A Heinz UK spokesman said the company took the decision after receiving " 30 to 40 " complaints " from all sides of the debate , not from one side exclusively " .
Despite the UK's pre-emptive move , the AFA appears to have applied significant pressure in the US that contributed to Heinz putting out a second , much more strongly worded statement distancing the company from the Deli Mayo TV ad .
" Heinz apologises for its misplaced attempt at humour and we accept that this ad was not in accordance with our longstanding corporate policy of respecting everyone 's rights and values , " said the statement , which was put out by Heinz US the day after the AFA galvanised its members to protest .
Michael Mullen , the director of global corporate affairs at Heinz , declined to reveal how many complaints - or how many votes of support - the company had received about the TV ad .
" The ad was intended to be humorous and was not intended to be an advocacy ad , " said Mullen in an email statement to MediaGuardian.co.uk .
" Heinz made the proactive decision to withdraw the ad before we were contacted by the American Family Association . "
Wayne Besen , an executive director of gay advocacy group The Truth Wins Out , appeared on a CNN debate in the US last week discussing the Heinz ad .
In the debate he raised issue of how the AFA , a powerful American lobby group , had played a role in the strong stance Heinz US had adopted over the ad .
" They are a very powerful constituency , a very powerful lobby group .
They are one of the top groups in the religious right in America , " Besen told MediaGuardian.co.uk .
He added that the AFA had gone after companies including Disney and Ford in the past .
" They have a lot of experience mobilising campaigns and boycotts .

Yahoo , Google , and Cisco all trekked over to the Senate today to sit for an hour under the grandfatherly , but strangely stern eye of Sen. Dick Durbin ( D - IL ) .
The subject was " Internet freedom , " but this turned out to be code for " censorship in China . "
While all three companies lamented censorship and the role that their products or services played in supporting it , each suggested that it was really the role of the US government to take up the censorship issue .
But when Durbin pressed the idea of legislation that would outlaw certain behaviors of US - based companies operating in other countries , the " we need more government involvement " rhetoric seized up faster than an unventilated Xbox 360 .
By the end of the hearing , Durbin was the only Senator in the room , and he ended the event with an announcement that some sort of legislation would soon be forthcoming , possibly modeled on a recent House bill .
Yahoo , Google , and Cisco , however , made clear that they would prefer the issue be seen as a trade barrier ( like some EU proposals ) , or that the State Department do more to address censorship through its Global Internet Freedom Task Force .
UN treaties like the International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights ( which China has not signed ) were covered by Google , while Yahoo talked up its own meetings on Chinese censorship with Condoleezza Rice .
Even some forms of legislation would be acceptable , so long as the law was designed more to protect US companies than to punish them .
Durbin and witnesses from Human Rights Watch and the Global Internet Freedom Consortium sounded less convinced , though , that multinational corporations were truly doing as much as they legally could to avoid censoring information .
Arvind Ganesan of Human Rights Watch said that a " virtual curtain " on the Internet was replacing the old " Iron Curtain " that separated the world into computing spheres of influence .
He called out search engines for censoring information " in anticipation " of what censors wanted , not merely in response to government requests .
He also suggested that the industry 's voluntary program to craft a code of conduct for dealing with censorship issues was going nowhere after 18 months of negotiations .
Some companies remain resistant to " independent monitoring , " he noted , saying that Google has " actively resisted such efforts .
Shiyo Zhou of the Global Internet Freedom Consortium referred to an recently unearthed six - year old internal presentation from a Cisco China engineer that outlined the Chinese government 's approach to Internet security and censorship in the course of 90 PowerPoint slides .
Shiyu argued that the presentation showed Cisco 's interest in powering China 's " Golden Shield , " and he charged that the company was aiding Chinese repression .
A Cisco representative expressed " regret " at some of information conveyed in the presentation , but said that Cisco sells only globally standard routing equipment in China and in no way customizes its products to aid censorship .
But some of the hearing 's toughest statements were made by Durbin .
After Google 's Nicole Wong claimed that engagement with China was better than isolation , Durbin said that the answer reminded him of corporate arguments regarding apartheid in South Africa .
When Yahoo explained how it set up and Internet human rights fund in November 2007 to offer legal support for dissidents who express their views online , Durbin retorted that Yahoo seemed bent on keeping the fund busy due to their 40 percent stake in a Chinese search engine that would continue to turn information over to the government upon request .
The companies fought back vigorously , with Google perhaps providing the best responses .
The company had not yet rolled out Gmail in China , Wong noted , since it could not guarantee that it would not have to turn over confidential information to the Chinese government .
In addition , Google was the first search engine to offer a notice whenever results were censored ; as a result of this innovation , Wong said that most Internet search engines in China have since followed suit .
Still , it did n't appear to mollify Durbin , and this sort of issue carries bipartisan appeal .
Sen . Tom Coburn ( R - OK ) , who was present at the beginning of the hearing , claimed that " China 's eyes are on us " and that the US government and corporations need to show the Chinese " what freedom looks like . "
There 's little time left in the legislative year for any new legislation to pass , but these companies have been on the hotseat with Congress for two years now and might be wise to ramp up their education and lobbying budgets in 2009 .

Man Caught Using Impersonator to Divorce Wife
An Indian man took a new approach to the painful process of divorce recently .
Sanjib Saha decided it would be best if he hired an impersonator to act as his wife during divorce procedures in the eastern city of Kolkata .
Both Sanjib and his fake wife said they sought a mutual divorce which the court granted .
Sanjib ’s real wife found out later , when she was asked to leave their home .
She immediately appealed to a higher court charging her husband with cheating on her and faking their divorce .
The court suspended the fake divorce leaving both Sanjib and his wife married once more .
“ The case exposed the legal loopholes in our system , ” Kaushik Chanda , lawyer of Saha ’s real wife , said .
Sanjib Saha finds himself in a tough situation .
If he now tries to get the divorce legally , the judge is likely to be very hard on him and rule in his wife ’s favor .
If he does n’t get the divorce he has to live and stay with his wife , who he just tried to divorce with an impersonator .
I would definitely not want to be in Sanjib ’s shoes …

Democratic presidential candidate Barack Obama continues to try to distance himself from his primary campaign proposal of having all troops out of Iraq in 16 months .
In an interview with the Military Times Obama was asked the timing and strategy involved in withdrawing the troops from Iraq .
“ It ’s very hard to anticipate what it ’s going to be like six months from now .
We saw how rapidly things have changed over the last six months , because of not only the extraordinary work of our armed forces , but also the shift in attitudes of tribal leaders in places like Anbar , the Mahdi army ’s decision to — for now at least — to stand down the more aggressive posture that the Maliki government took in going into places like Basra , ” Obama said .
Obama said withdrawal could happen quickly if the situation in Iraq continues to improve , “ So if current trends continue and we are at a position where we continue to see reductions in violence and stabilization and continue to see some improvements on the part of the Iraqi army and Iraqi police , then my hope would be that we could draw down in a deliberate fashion in consultation with the Iraqi government at a pace that is determined in consultation with General Petraeus and the other commanders on the ground . ”

However , he made it clear that if things deteriorate in Iraq , the troops might not come home so quickly , “ It strikes me that that is something we could begin relatively soon after inauguration .
If , on the other hand , you ’ve got a deteriorating situation for some reason , then that ’s going to have to be taken into account . ”
Obama has made it clear that he opposes this war , and that he wants to end it , but what has also become very clear is that Obama is n’t committed to having all of the troops out in 16 months .
This shift makes his position a lot closer to one Hillary Clinton took , and many liberal Democrats rejected , during the primary campaign .
I completely understand that Obama does n’t want to stick to a firm timeline then get bitten by it later if he does n’t get all of the troops out on time , but this is quite a switch from his earlier rhetoric , and he seems to have left the door open for a slower withdrawal from Iraq .
Transcript of the Military Times interview
NATIONS , like people , occasionally get the blues ; and right now the United States , normally the world 's most self - confident place , is glum .
Eight out of ten Americans think their country is heading in the wrong direction .
The hapless George Bush is partly to blame for this : his approval ratings are now sub-Nixonian .
But many are concerned not so much about a failed president as about a flailing nation .
One source of angst is the sorry state of American capitalism ( see article ) .
The “ Washington consensus ” told the world that open markets and deregulation would solve its problems .
Yet American house prices are falling faster than during the Depression , petrol is more expensive than in the 1970s , banks are collapsing , the euro is kicking sand in the dollar 's face , credit is scarce , recession and inflation both threaten the economy , consumer confidence is an oxymoron and Belgians have just bought Budweiser , “ America 's beer ” .
And it 's not just the downturn that has caused this discontent .
Many Americans feel as if they missed the boom .
Between 2002 and 2006 the incomes of 99 % rose by an average of 1 % a year in real terms , while those of the top 1 % rose by 11 % a year ; three - quarters of the economic gains during Mr Bush 's presidency went to that top 1 % .
Economic envy , once seen as a European vice , is now rife .
The rich appear in Barack Obama 's speeches not as entrepreneurial role models but as modern versions of the “ malefactors of great wealth ” denounced by Teddy Roosevelt a century ago : this lot , rather than building trusts , avoid taxes and ship jobs to Mexico .
Globalisation is under fire : free trade is less popular in the United States than in any other developed country , and a nation built on immigrants is building a fence to keep them out .
People mutter about nation - building beginning at home : why , many wonder , should American children do worse at reading than Polish ones and at maths than Lithuanians ?
The dragon 's breath on your shoulder
Abroad , America has spent vast amounts of blood and treasure , to little purpose .
In Iraq , finding an acceptable exit will look like success ; Afghanistan is slipping .
America 's claim to be a beacon of freedom in a dark world has been dimmed by Guantánamo , Abu Ghraib and the flouting of the Geneva Conventions amid the panicky “ unipolar ” posturing in the aftermath of September 11th .
Now the world seems very multipolar .
Europeans no longer worry about American ascendancy .
The French , some say , understood the Arab world rather better than the neoconservatives did .
Russia , the Gulf Arabs and the rising powers of Asia scoff openly at the Washington consensus .
China in particular spooks America — and may do so even more over the next few weeks of Olympic medal - gathering .
Americans are discussing the rise of China and their consequent relative decline ; measuring when China 's economy will be bigger and counting its missiles and submarines has become a popular pastime in Washington .
A few years ago , no politician would have been seen with a book called “ The Post - American World ” .
Mr Obama has been conspicuously reading Fareed Zakaria 's recent volume .
America has got into funks before now .
In the 1950s it went into a Sputnik - driven spin about Soviet power ; in the 1970s there was Watergate , Vietnam and the oil shocks ; in the late 1980s Japan seemed to be buying up America .
Each time , the United States rebounded , because the country is good at fixing itself .
Just as American capitalism allows companies to die , and to be created , quickly , so its political system reacts fast .
In Europe , political leaders emerge slowly , through party hierarchies ; in America , the primaries permit inspirational unknowns to burst into the public consciousness from nowhere .
Still , countries , like people , behave dangerously when their mood turns dark .
If America fails to distinguish between what it needs to change and what it needs to accept , it risks hurting not just allies and trading partners , but also itself .
The Asian scapegoat
There are certainly areas where change is needed .
The credit crunch is in part the consequence of a flawed regulatory system .
Lax monetary policy allowed Americans to build up debts and fuelled a housing bubble that had to burst eventually .
Lessons need to be learnt from both of those mistakes ; as they do from widespread concerns about the state of education and health care .
Over-unionised and unaccountable , America 's school system needs the same sort of competition that makes its universities the envy of the world .
American health care , which manages to be the most expensive on the planet even though it fails properly to care for the tens of millions of people , badly needs reform .
There have been plenty of mistakes abroad , too .
Waging a war on terror was always going to be like pinning jelly to a wall .
As for Guantánamo Bay , it is the most profoundly un-American place on the planet : rejoice when it is shut .
In such areas America is already showing its genius for reinvention .
Both the Republican and Democratic presidential candidates promise to close Guantánamo .
As his second term ticks down , even Mr Bush has begun to see the limits of unilateralism .
Instead of just denouncing and threatening the “ axis of evil ” he is working more closely with allies ( and non-allies ) in Asia to calm down North Korea .
For the first time he has just let American officials join in the negotiations with Iran about its fishy nuclear programme ( see article ) .
That America is beginning to correct its mistakes is good ; and there 's plenty more of that to be done .
But one source of angst demands a change in attitude rather than a drive to restore the status quo : America 's relative decline , especially compared with Asia in general and China in particular .
The economic gap between America and a rising Asia has certainly narrowed ; but worrying about it is wrong for two reasons .
First , even at its present growth rate , China 's GDP will take a quarter of a century to catch up with America's ; and the internal tensions that China 's rapidly changing economy has caused may well lead it to stumble before then .
Second , even if Asia 's rise continues unabated , it is wrong — and profoundly unAmerican — to regard this as a problem .
Economic growth , like trade , is not a zero - sum game .
The faster China and India grow , the more American goods they buy .
And they are booming largely because they have adopted America 's ideas .
America should regard their success as a tribute , not a threat , and celebrate in it .
Many Americans , unfortunately , are unwilling to do so .
Politicians seeking a scapegoat for America 's self - made problems too often point the finger at the growing power of once - poor countries , accusing them of stealing American jobs and objecting when they try to buy American companies .
But if America reacts by turning in on itself — raising trade barriers and rejecting foreign investors — it risks exacerbating the economic troubles that lie behind its current funk .
Everybody goes through bad times .
Some learn from the problems they have caused themselves , and come back stronger .
Some blame others , lash out and damage themselves further .
America has had the wisdom to take the first course many times before .
Let 's hope it does so again .
The rantings and ravings of an authority averse , amateur wordsmith .
SEATTLE–A hiker who lost his life on Mount Rainier lay down in the snow and used his body 's warmth to protect his wife and a friend from the 112 - kilometre per hour winds of a freak June blizzard , national park officials said .
When it became obvious the trio could not find their way back to base camp in whiteout conditions , they dug a snow trench with their hands .
Eduard Burceag , 31 , lay down in the snow while his wife and friend lay on top of him .
Later , when they begged him to switch places , Burceag refused , saying he was okay .
" In doing so , he probably saved their lives , " park spokesperson Kevin Bacher said Thursday .
Mariana Burceag , also 31 , survived the storm , as did the couple 's friend , Daniel Vlad , 34 .
Eduard Burceag was just one of the heroes .
When the call came at 3:30 a.m. Tuesday to the Camp Muir base camp , saying three hikers were missing in a blizzard , the National Park Service ranger in charge of rescue operations had little hope they would survive the night .
Kevin Hammonds , 28 , described the storm as the worst he had ever seen during his years of hiking and mountain climbing : wind blowing hard enough to knock you off your feet and zero visibility , making it impossible to see your hand in front of your face .
" The fact that any of them made it is noteworthy , " Hammonds said Thursday .
His lack of optimism did n't stop Hammonds and a fellow ranger , Joe Franklin , from preparing a search party to head out at first light .
Around 5:30 a.m. , Franklin was checking the horizon for any clues to the location of the missing hikers , all natives of Romania who were living in Bellevue , a Seattle suburb .
He saw what looked like a boulder in an unusual spot on the snowfield , then took a closer look with binoculars and realized the shape was moving .
Hammonds grabbed two mountain guides who had stayed the night at Camp Muir , about 10,000 feet up the 14,410 - foot mountain , and headed out toward Vlad .
Walking through knee - deep , blowing snow , it took about 10 minutes to meet him halfway .
Bacher called Vlad a hero , for his determination to get help .
" It was n't that he had the physical stamina to do it , but he had the mental will , " Bacher said .
One guide helped Vlad back to Camp Muir after directing Hammonds and Eben Reckord of International Mountain Guides toward the Burceags .
" We were able to , more or less , find them right away because he had given us such a good description , " Hammonds said .
" They would have actually been hard for us to find without his guidance .
Where they were definitely was not in eyeshot of camp . "
Mariana Burceag was conscious but not coherent , said Hammonds , a trained emergency medical technician .
Eduard Burceag was unconscious ; they could n't find a pulse .
" The two of us had to make a decision that she needed our immediate attention , " Hammonds said .
" It was obvious to us , that ... if left there much longer , she would probably be in the same shape he was . "

Hammonds ' training told him they had to focus on the person most likely to survive .
They put a second down jacket on Mariana Burceag , placed her in a sleeping bag and onto a sleeping pad , covered her with a small tent and started to drag the whole package toward Camp Muir .
They got about 100 feet closer to the camp before Hammonds and Reckord realized they needed more help .
Four more guides answered their call with oxygen , another sleeping bag and a sled .
It took another hour for six people to get Mariana Burceag to shelter .
Then the rescuers went back for Eduard Burceag .
Perhaps another hour passed before they got him to shelter ; attempts to revive him were unsuccessful .
Hammonds said the three were experienced hikers – both Eduard Burceag and Vlad had summited Rainier in the past – and were dressed properly for a spring hike in warm winter jackets , wool hats and gloves , and sturdy boots .
Thick clouds prevented a helicopter evacuation that day .
An Army chopper rescued Mariana Burceag and Vlad from the peak Wednesday morning .
They were treated for frostbite at a Seattle hospital and released .
Eduard Burceag 's body was brought down the mountain on a sled Wednesday afternoon .
The Pierce County medical examiner 's office confirmed Thursday night that he died of hypothermia .
Reached by telephone in Romania , Eduard Burceag 's brother , Cristian , told The Seattle Times his older brother moved to the United States eight years ago and fell in love with Seattle , its mountains , its opportunities .
Cristian Burceag said his mother was visiting his brother and was watching their two young sons while Eduard and Mariana hiked to Camp Muir .
He said he was not surprised his brother died shielding his wife from the blizzard .
" He was a hero for us , " the younger Burceag said .
" I 'm sure he would do that .
He knew very well that his children needed a lot of their mother and that was the main thing in his life . "
TEHRAN ( Reuters ) -
An adviser of Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said there was a plot to assassinate the Iranian president during a U.N. food crisis summit in Italy earlier this month , an Iranian daily reported on Tuesday .

It came a few days after Ahmadinejad , who often rails against the West , accused the United States and its allies of plotting to kidnap and kill him during a visit to neighboring Iraq in March .
Presidential adviser Ali Zabihi said Ahmadinejad ’s policies since his election in 2005 were threatening “ the illegitimate interests ” of many foreign powers and domestic circles , the Etemad-e Melli daily reported .
“ Therefore they are thinking about his dismissal or assassination , ” Zabihi said in the northwestern city of Tabriz .
A plan to kidnap Ahmadinejad in Baghdad in March and a plot to assassinate him at this month ’s three - day summit in Rome were part of this , he said , without giving details , adding : “ Both of those were aborted with God ’s help . ”
Ahmadinejad , widely expected to stand for re-election next year , visited Rome on June 3 .
Reformist critics of the president have asked why the Iranian government has not lodged an official complaint about the alleged plot .
“ Another assassination claim , ” the reformist Mardomsalari said in a front - page headline on Tuesday .
On Friday , Ahmadinejad was quoted as saying by state radio : “ Based on reliable intelligence , our enemies had plans to kidnap and kill your servant ( Ahmadinejad ) .
But we intentionally made last - minute changes in our schedule . ”
A U.S. military official in Baghdad said he was unaware of any threats against Ahmadinejad during his visit to Iraq .
During the first visit by an Iranian leader to Iraq since the neighbors fought an eight - year war in the 1980s , Ahmadinejad cancelled his scheduled visit to Shi’ite holy cities of Karbala and Najaf in southern Iraq .
The presidential office said at the time the trip was cancelled for security reasons .
The United States accuses Iran of funding , arming and training Shi’ite militias in Iraq .
Iran denies the charge .
The two are also at odds over U.S. claims , denied by Tehran , that Iran is trying to build nuclear weapons .
Sixteen years after Barbie dolls declared , " Math class is tough ! " girls are proving that when it comes to math they are just as tough as boys .
In the largest study of its kind , girls measured up to boys in every grade , from second through 11th .
The research was released Thursday in the journal Science .
Parents and teachers persist in thinking boys are simply better at math , said Janet Hyde , the University of Wisconsin - Madison researcher who led the study .
And girls who grow up believing it wind up avoiding harder math classes .
" It keeps girls and women out of a lot of careers , particularly high - prestige , lucrative careers in science and technology , " Hyde said .
I 'm shocked , I tell you — shocked : Math study finds girls are just as good as boys .
( Nice headline .
Snort . ) Mmm .
Yes , that — plus the " demeaning and condescending attitudes , lots of off - color jokes , sexual innuendo , arrogance ; colleagues , particularly in the tech culture , who genuinely think women do n't have what it takes — who see them as genetically inferior . "
Just off the top of my head , possibly there are so many men who see themselves as genetically superior because they 've been erroneously told all their lives that they are .
I always tested higher on aptitude tests in math / science than I did in language .
Now that I have official reassurance that proximity to a calculator wo n't detonate my vajayjay , I 'm giving up the blogging biz and setting out to fulfill my dream of becoming a mad scientist - cum - evil genius who will hold the entire planet hostage to my every whim under constant threat of death by Doomsday Laser [ H / T Oddjob . ]
We take the moon for granted , but Earth would be a very different place had our nearest neighbor only achieved half of its present mass when it formed some 4.5 billion years ago in a titanic collision .
In fact , we might not even be here to appreciate it at all .
Let 's start with eclipses .
In one of those bizarre cosmic coincidences , our moon today is positioned at just the right distance between Earth and the sun for its diameter to completely block out the sun during a total solar eclipse — the next of which will occur on Friday , August 1 . [ see ScientificAmerican.com 's special report on the eclipse ] .
But what would happen if the moon had only grew to half its present mass ?
Assuming our half - size moon was composed of rock as dense as that of the actual moon , it would still be 80 percent as large across as the full - size version ( based on the relationship between a sphere 's volume and radius that you learned in grade school ) .
Most solar eclipses are " annular , " meaning that the moon only partially blocks the sun and appears to be framed by a ring of glowing sunlight .
Annular eclipses happen on average three to four times a year ; total eclipses only occur about once per annum .
At its current distance from Earth , if the moon were 80 percent of its current size , there could be no total eclipses — just the annular kind .
A less massive moon would also orbit closer to Earth than the real one .
( This means that total eclipses could still happen , although the half - mass moon would have to be at least 20 percent closer to Earth than the actual moon is now , or closer — but that would require a coincidence on top of a coincidence )
Our real moon orbits at an average distance of 238,600 miles ( 384,000 kilometers ) , but every year it drifts about 1.6 inches ( four centimeters ) farther away .
The cause ?
Ocean tides .
The moon 's gravity , combined with the waltz of Earth and the moon around their center of mass , forces the oceans into an oval shape , with two simultaneous high tides .
One high tide is on the side of Earth facing the moon , whereas the other high tide is directly opposite , on the other side of our world .
Because Earth spins so rapidly compared with the moon 's orbit around us , our planet drags the high tide closest to the moon a little bit ahead of it .
The gravitational pull of the water on the trailing moon imparts energy to it .
This makes it spiral a little farther outward with every orbit around Earth .
( Each lunar revolution takes about 29.5 days ) .
If the moon were half its mass , then the ocean tides would have been correspondingly smaller and imparted less energy to it .
Given the moon 's lesser mass , this means that less energy would be required to push it away from Earth ; however , it turns out that the half - as - big high tide would actually contain less water than our high tide , therefore it would have less mass to influence the half - pint moon 's orbit .
So a less massive moon would nonetheless end up closer than the real one to Earth .
The energy given to the moon comes from Earth 's rotation — and to compensate , our planet is slowing down .
In other words , days are getting longer .
Geologists believe that an Earth day was originally five to six hours long .
If the moon had been less massive , thereby creating less drag on Earth , our planet would n't have slowed down as much .
The day would be , perhaps , 15 hours long .
Weaker tides ( of a half moon ) would also have caused less erosion of Earth 's landmasses over the past few billion years — and the continents ' shorelines would likely look quite different for it .
Less soil and minerals from land leaching into the ocean might have had profound effects on the origin of life , too .
Some organic ( carbon - based ) compounds thought to have seeded life may not have made it into the primordial soup of the early oceans , which would also have mixed less thanks to the reduced tides .
Assuming life had still arisen , it would have had to contend with more frequent ice ages as well more extreme warm snaps .
Large moons stabilize planets .
Mars , which sports only two tiny moons , wobbles a lot on its axis , and as a result it has bigger climatic swings and seasonal temperature changes than Earth does .
Without the full - mass moon to hold us steady , life on Earth might have experienced greater seasonal fluctuations .
The outlook for life would have been dim — literally .
A smaller moon means less scattered sunlight at night — that 's all moonlight is — which would mean darker nighttimes .
Whatever life forms did evolve on this altered Earth would have had to develop bigger or more sensitive eyes to help them navigate , forage and spawn at night under this diminished glow .

Soft hyphen ( SHY ) – a hard problem ?
Summary
There has been a fundamental controversy about the soft hyphen character ( often abbreviated SHY , one HTML notation : ­ ) .
Although the ISO Latin 1 standard ( ISO 8859 - 1 ) makes things perfectly clear , saying that it is a visible hyphen , to be used in a specific context , it is commonly regarded as hidden hyphenation hint , and this is what the Unicode standard currently says .
These two views are incompatible .
This conflict of standards has its counterpart in various interpretations of the soft hyphen in programs .
For example , Microsoft Office software treats the soft hyphen as a visible character with no special semantics ; it uses an Ascii control character as a discreationary hyphen , calling it “ soft hyphen ” .
The “ hyphenation hint ” interpretation is caused by the strong needs for hyphenation of Web documents .
These needs are very real , but it was a bad move to try to answer to them in a manner that implies a conflict between character code standards .
Moreover , explicit hyphenation hints can play only a very small role in the solution of the hyphenation problem , and the ( mis ) use of SHY would not even be the best way of giving hyphenation hints .
On the other hand , the HTML 4 specification defines SHY as a hyphenation hint , although in a manner which suggests that universal support to it is not to be expected .
The support is now fairly wide , though only as primitive ( simplistic ) implementations .
Thus , in Web authoring , SHY ( written e.g. using the entity ­ ) can be used as an occasional hyphenation hint in special cases , with the small risk that it may be displayed as a normal hyphen in any context by some ( rare ) browsers .
Moreover , some browsers ( e.g. , Firefox 2 ) simply ignore SHY and some ( Google Chrome ) implement it partly incorrectly .
What the ISO Latin 1 standard says
The ISO Latin 1 character code , also known as ISO 8859 - 1 , and the ISO 8859 character sets in general , contain a character named soft hyphen , abbreviated SHY , code value 255 in octal .
In general , the ISO 8859 standards specify the characters and their codes only , not the use of the characters .
However , soft hyphen is one of the few exceptions .
The ISO 8859 - 1 standard defines , in section 6.3.3 , both the graphic presentation and the usage of soft hyphen , as follows :
A graphic character that is imaged by a graphic symbol identical with , or similar to , that representing hyphen , for use when a line break has been established within a word .
Thus , according to ISO 8859 - 1 , soft hyphen is a visible ( graphic ) character , not an invisible hyphenation hint .
Soft hyphen is not related to any word division process to be applied to the text but may indicate what has happened in such a process when the text was produced .
Such a character seems to appear in the EBCDIC character set , too , under the name “ syllable hyphen ” , also abbreviated “ SHY ” .
It is described in a glossary by IBM ( AS / 400 Master Glossary ) as follows :
syllable hyphen
In the OfficeVision program , a hyphen used to divide a word at the end of a line ; it may be removed when the OfficeVision program adjusts lines .
Contrast with required hyphen .
As regards to the difference between a normal hyphen and a soft hyphen , the specification says that there might or might not be some visible difference .
The difference in usage is that the soft hyphen is for a particular use – in practise , at the end of a line .
The specification does not prohibit the use of normal hyphen there as well .
Thus , it is possible but not mandatory to indicate whether a hyphen at the end of a line belongs to the word itself ( and is to be presented even if the word is not divided into lines at that point ) , by using normal hyphen in that case and soft hyphen otherwise .
As early as in 1982 , ECMA ( originally established as European Computer Manufacturers ’ Association ) begun work on a standard with aims similar to those that lead to the ISO 8859 standardization , and in March 1985 , ECMA published Standard ECMA -94 8 - Bit Single Byte Coded Graphic Character Sets - Latin Alphabets No. 1 to No. 4 .
It is largely compatible with parts 1 through 4 of ISO 8859 .
The 2nd edition of ECMA - 94 ( June 1986 ) is available on the Web in PDF and PostScript formats .
The interesting thing is that as regards to the Latin 1 characters , ECMA - 94 and ISO 8859 - 1 appear to be almost identical , except possibly for some variation in the names of characters , but for the soft hyphen , they differ .
At least they formulate things differently , in definitions that are word by word identical up to a point :
Definitions of the semantics of soft hyphen ( SHY ) ECMA - 94 ( clause 6.3.3 ) ISO 8859 - 1 ( clause 6.3.3 )
A graphic character that is imaged by a graphic symbol identical with , or similar to , that representing HYPHEN , for use when a line break is permitted in the text as presented .
A graphic character that is imaged by a graphic symbol identical with , or similar to , that representing HYPHEN , for use when a line break has been established within a word .
So what does the difference between “ is permitted in the text as presented ” and “ has been established within a word ” mean ?
The former , ECMA - 94 , formulation seems to suggest use as a hyphenation hint , indicating permissible hyphenation point , though since it ’s described as being a graphic character , the description is subject to various interpretations .
If ISO 8859 - 1 , which assumably used ECMA - 94 as the basis , really wanted to clarify the formulation into the “ invisible hyphenation hint ” direction , it was n’t very successful .
It seems much more natural to assume that the intent was to prevent such an interpretation .
Soft hyphen in typography
In typographic tradition , the expression “ soft hyphen ” often seems to correspond to a visible hyphen that has been added at the end of a line .
For example , The Complete Manual of Typography by James Felici ( Peachpit Press , 2003 ) says , on page 85 :
A hyphen added by a hyphenation program us called a soft hyphen , and it will disappear when the word in which it occurs no longer needs to be broken at line ’s end .
A hyphen that you key into a manuscript is called a hard hyphen , and it is a permanent part of the text stream .
However , the difference between such a definition and a hyphenation hint is often obscured by formulations that do not clearly distinguish between a character encoded as part of text ( stored in digital format ) and a visible symbol on paper or screen .
The same book comes , on page 143 , rather close to the idea of a soft hyphen as an invisible hyphenation hint :
There are several types of hyphens .
The hard hyphen is keyed into a manuscript and becomes a permanent part of the text stream .
Another kind of hyphen is added by the hyphenation dictionary or algorithm of your program .
It ’s temporary and will dis­appear i it ’s no longer needed to divide a word at the end of a line .
A hybrid between the two is the discretionary hyphen , or soft hyphen .
If your program fails to hyphenate a word correctly ( or at all ) , you can type in a discretionary hyphen that acts like a dictionary - or algorithm - inserted hyphen .
That is , it will disappear if it ’s not needed .
You can also use a discretionary hyphen to suggest to your program a preferable hyphenation point , even though the one the program has chosen is legitimate .
What the book here describes as “ another kind of hyphen ” appears to be the soft hyphen as discussed previously in the book .
The Oxford Style Manual describes the old typographic concept of soft hyphen rather unambiguously , at the very start of section 5.10 Hyphens and dashes :
The hyphen is of two types .
The first , called the ‘ hard ’ hyphen , joins words together anywhere they are positioned in the line .
The second , called the ‘ soft ’ hyphen , indicates word division when a word is broken at the end of a line .
On typescripts , editors should use the stet mark on hard hyphens at the end of lines to distinguish them from soft hyphens .
The HTML 2.0 and HTML 3.2 view
According to the HTML 2.0 specification ( RFC 1866 ) , the document character set of an HTML document must be ISO Latin 1 or some superset of it .
( In HTML 3.2 the situation was clarified further that it shall be a specific superset of it , namely ISO 10646 . )
It specifies , in the section Characters , Words , and Paragraphs , some features of the processing of characters .
The visible presentation involves reformatting , but of course any ISO Latin 1 character for which no specific treatment is mandated shall be presented as such .
( Variations in sizes , font faces etc are allowed , of course . )
There is no specific rule for a soft hyphen , just the following note :
Use of the non-breaking space and soft hyphen indicator characters is discouraged because support for them is not widely deployed .
Being just a note , this does not introduce any additional rule .
It implies that the two characters mentioned must be supported but warns authors ( without relaxing requirements on browsers ) that those characters may not be processed according to the specifications on all browsers .
The HTML 3.2 specification is partly less informative than HTML 2.0 , so we must really assume the material in HTML 2.0 as the default when reading HTML 3.2 .
It mentions the soft hyphen in no other way than by introducing a quasi-symbolic notation , ­ , for it , to be used as identical with the older ­ notation .
So what is the intended use of SHY in HTML documents ?
Should a line ending with SHY be treated so that effectively the SHY and the following newline are removed , restoring the integrity of a word that had been divided into lines ?
This would be natural , but there is no specific requirement on this and it does not logically follow from the definition of ISO Latin 1 ( which does not prescribe in any way how the text should be processed in eventual reformatting – such issues are outside the scope of a character code standard ) .
The so - called internationalization activity of the W3C produced a short document on hyphenation which seems to take it for granted that SHY is a hyphenation hint .
This was reflected in the document Internationalization of the Hypertext Markup Language ( RFC 2070 ; in January 1997 ; now obsolete ) which contains the following :
NOTE - the soft hyphen character ( U+00 AD ) needs special attention from user - agent implementers .
It is present in many character sets ( including the whole ISO 8859 series and , of course , ISO 10646 ) , and can always be included by means of the reference ­ .
Its semantics are different from the plain hyphen : it indicates a point in a word where a line break is allowed .
If the line is indeed broken there , a hyphen must be displayed at the end of the first line .
If not , the character is not dispalyed at all .
In operations like searching and sorting , it must always be ignored .
Strangely , this was presented in a note as if referring to a specification set up elsewhere , but without citing any source .
Anyway , this approach was adopted later in HTML 4 .
A review of some discussions
This section reviews some relatively old discussions which the author found on the Web .
In a discussion on a mailing list ( HTML - WG ) as early as in 1994 , an article suggested two different interpretations :
a visible hyphen within a word :
My assumption was that the purpose of this soft hyphen would be to mark a visible hyphen or dash character that can be used as a word separator ; for example , in order to break the word " drawing -
parlour " at a margin ( as in this letter ) , one would use the string " drawing­parlour " in their HTML document .
an invisible mark for a possible hyphenation point :
The other interpretation is that ­ would mark an * invisible * point at which a word can be broken ; thus , " al­go­rithm " could be used to represent a word which can be broken at a margin into the portions " al - " and " gorithm , " or " algo - " and " rithm , " depending on which is needed by the browser .
it is a “ graphic character that is imaged by a graphic symbol identical with , or similar to , that representing hyphen ”
identical with , or similar to , that representing ” it is “ for use when a line break has been established within a word ” .
Yet another interpretation of what SHY should mean was presented in an article that suggested that it might mean the following :
a real hyphen which is an allowed breakpoint , as in much­needed and as opposed to a non-breaking one like X - Windows ( where you do n’t want an X - at the end of a line
In a Usenet message , Olle Järnefors has commented several character issues and raised the following question :
… the current definition of SHY … says nothing about how to image the character when it is within a word on a line and not at the end of the line ( which should be more frequent than the other situation ) .
My interpretation of the wording of ISO 8859 - 1 is that SHY shall definitely be presented as a hyphen , either identical with or similar to hyphen , in all positions .
This is a requirement on programs which present ISO 8859 - 1 characters in visible form .
The occurrence of SHY in other positions than at the end of a line is a violation of the standard by the person or program which produced the text , but such violation implies no change on the requirement of the standard .
( As a remote analogue , if I violate the rules of the English language by misspelling a word , programs should not “ fix ” this by displaying my text differently from the requirements of the character code used .
They may of course suggest changes to the text itself .
Similarly , a Web browser might separately report that SHY is used incorrectly in the document , but it must still display SHY as a hyphen . )
The question of the nature of SHY seems to appear again and again in discussions about HTML .
For example , the document Suggestion for hyphenation indications in HTML - < HYPH > , ( May 1996 ) says :
The current situation in HTML is that the only possible way to specify to the client where a hyphenation can be done is by using the soft hyphen character .
The soft hyphen issue has been discussed in the www - html list .
Interestingly , an article was posted which quoted a message from the president of the Unicode consortium , saying just the following
The Unicode character 00 AD is defined to be invisible , except at the end of a line , where it may or may not be visible , depending on the script .
( Here “ 00 AD ” means the character which has code 00 AD in hexadecimal , i.e. the soft hyphen character . )
As a commented in my reply , such a statement , despite its authoritative appearance , cannot settle the question .
However , after the approval of version 3.0 of the Unicode standard the official answer is that Unicode regards the soft hyphen as an invisible hyphenation hint .
This was further clarified in Unicode 4.0 , where the semantics of the soft hyphen “ were clarified : it marks a position for hyphenation , rather than being itself a hyphen character ” .
There is a paper by Kent Karlsson titled Soft Hyphen and some other characters , presented as an expert contribution to the ISO / IEC JTC 1 / SC 2 working group WG3 .
It says ( referring to this document of mine by its old address ) :
The text concerning SOFT HYPHEN in the ISO / IEC 8859 series ( and in ISO / IEC 6937 ) is unclear , and has been misinterpreted as disallowing SOFT HYPHEN if not immediately followed by a LINE FEED and / or CARRIAGE RETURN ) .
See e.g. : http://www.hut.fi/~jkorpela/shy.html.
This misinterpretation has been circulated as " the correct one " on one of the Linux mailing lists .
It then cites the ISO 8859 definition and says ( with a mismatched left quotation mark , here replaced by Ascii quotation mark ) :
The intent here is that the graphic symbol is to be used when " a line break has been established within a word , and that otherwise no graphic symbol is to be used .
The paper says that “ text in the 8859 series on SOFT HYPHEN is unclear ” and proposes the following reformulation :
SOFT HYPHEN ( 00AD ) : SOFT HYPHEN ( SHY ) allows an automatic line break to be established just after it ( like ZERO WIDTH SPACE ) .
SOFT HYPHEN is imaged by a graphic symbol identical with that representing HYPHEN when an automatic line break has been established just after it , or if it is directly followed by an explicit line break ( including end - of - string ) .
When an automatic line break has not been established just after it , nor is it followed by an explicit line break , the SOFT HYPHEN is not rendered and has zero width .
Note :
In certain combinations , e.g. , webb < SHY > besökare , the SOFT HYPHEN can in addition suppress the letter following the SOFT HYPHEN when the SOFT HYPHEN is not rendered ( e.g. webbesökare ) .
Such behaviour is similar to automatic ligature formation .
Well , this would be clear , although the question arises whether the ECMA formulation was even clearer .
Whether it was the original intent in ISO 8859 standards is an open question .
But in any case , it does not correspond to the way that typical , widely used text processing programs ( e.g. , MS Word ) work : they do not use or recognize soft hyphen as an invisible hyphenation hint .
Instead , they use ASCII control characters or other special techniques to store such hints , and regard the soft hyphen as yet another data character only , to be displayed in a fixed manner as dictated by the font in use .
The HTML 4 view
It should be clear from the preceding arguments that in the context of ISO 8859 - 1 , the soft hyphen character is , per se , a visible character for a specific use which can hardly be frequent in HTML .
On the other hand , the specification of a markup language like HTML can naturally define specific semantics for printable characters .
Just as the less than sign ( < ) has a very special meaning , not derivable from the normal meaning of “ less than ” , the soft hyphen might be defined to mean something which is more or less different from its meaning in ISO 8859 .
( These cases are not quite comparable , since the less than sign is the concrete syntax representation of SGML abstract syntax whereas the soft hyphen character would be separately defined to have a special meaning as a data character .
Thus , the space character and the non-breaking space are closer analogues . )
In a sense , the HTML 4.0 specification is more explicit here than the HTML 2.0 and HTML 3.2 specifications .
It says , in section Text , subsection Lines and Paragraphs , clause Hyphenation :
In HTML , there are two types of hyphens : the plain hyphen and the soft hyphen .
The plain hyphen should be interpreted by a user agent as just another character .
The soft hyphen tells the user agent where a line break can occur .
Those browsers that interpret soft hyphens must observe the following semantics :
If a line is broken at a soft hyphen , a hyphen character must be displayed at the end of the first line .
If a line is not broken at a soft hyphen , the user agent must not display a hyphen character .
For operations such as searching and sorting , the soft hyphen should always be ignored .
In HTML , the plain hyphen is represented by the " - " character (- or -) .
The soft hyphen is represented by the character entity reference ­ ( ­ or ­ )
In a sense , this clearly defines the “ discretionary hyphen ” semantics for the soft hyphen .
( In fact , it might be clearer , since the phrase “ where a line break can occur ” is somewhat abstract and obscure ; line breaks do not just “ occur ” , they are produced by user agents . )
And the character entity reference list even names the character as “ soft hyphen = discretionary hyphen ” .
But notice the wording “ Those browsers that interpret soft hyphens “ .
Perhaps the intent is to refer to the fact that browsers need not divide words into lines at all , in which case they would ignore soft hyphens .
But the obvious interpretation of the wording is that browsers need not “ interpret soft hyphens ” at all .
In that case they would treat them as normal data characters having their normal meanings as set up in ISO 8859 - 1 .
This would imply that soft hyphens are displayed as hyphens .
The specification explicitly requires the display of a hyphen when a line is broken at a soft hyphen .
This contradicts with the modern Unicode semantics for the character .
It also strongly suggests that the character displayed is the “ plain hyphen ” discussed in the text , i.e. the Ascii hyphen - minus U+002D , which does not correspond to a modern view on the rendering issue .
Early definitions
In the Unicode standard version 2.0 , soft hyphen was defined as follows :
U+00 AD soft hyphen indicates a hyphenation point , where a line - break is preferred when a word is to be hyphenated .
Depending on the script , the visible rendering of this character when a line break occurs may differ ( for example , in some scripts it is rendered as a hyphen - , while in others it may be invisible ) .
The Unicode standard also defines U+2027 hyphenation point , but that character is irrelevant for the discussion here .
( It is a raised dot , resembling a middle dot and used to indicate correct word breaking , e.g. in dictionaries .
It is definitely a printable character , and the very purpose of its use implies that it must be visible .
Naturally , this makes it very clear that the soft hyphen is not intended to be a visible hyphenation hint to humans ; the discussion revolves around the question whether it is intended to be an invisible hyphenation hint to computer programs . )
The code table in Unicode 2.0 mentioned “ discretionary hyphen ” as an alternative name for soft hyphen .
This , together with the definition quoted above , implies that the intention was to specify that soft hyphen is not a normal printable character but essentially an invisible hyphenation hint , which may cause a hyphen - like glyph to be rendered if some program actually divides the word into two lines at the suggested hyphenation point .
One might say that this does not make the soft hyphen even a conditionally printable character , since an eventual glyph is used by the program to indicate what it has done .
The appearance and form of such a glyph may or may not depend on whether hyphenation took place due to a hyphenation hint given by a soft hyphen or due to normal hyphenation rules ( based on dictionary lookup or algorithmic rules or something else ) .
Notice that the definition of soft hyphen in ISO 8859 - 1 strongly suggests that when a line break within a word has been established by a program applying hyphenation rules , it could use the ( visible ) soft hyphen character so that the situation can be distinguished ( programmatically at least , perhaps visually too ) from a hyphen that occurs at the end of a line for some other reason .
Such a definition seems to be in definite contradiction with ISO 8859 - 1 as regards to the definition and use of the soft hyphen characters .
These important standards conflicting , and implementations being defective from both viewpoints , the practical conclusion was that usually authors should not use the soft hyphen character at all , for any purpose .
The conclusion was supported by the fact that few browsers implemented the soft hyphen in the Unicode way .
There ’s practical problem to be considered if soft hyphens are used : they may prevent hyphenation elsewhere in a word .
The Unicode Standard Annex # 14 ( Line Breaking Properties ) says , in the description of the soft hyphen :
The action of a hyphenation algorithm is equivalent to the insertion of a SHY .
However , when a word contains an explicit SHY it is customarily treated as overriding the action of the hyphenator for that word .
Although Web browsers generally have no hyphenation algorithms at present , future versions may have at least simple algorithms for some major languages .
This means that an author who uses a soft hyphen within a word should specify all the permissible hyphenation points in that word explicitly .
The Unicode FAQ ( by the Unicode Consortium ) now contains an entry on SHY :
Q : Unicode now treats the SOFT HYPHEN as format control ( Cf ) character when formerly it was a punctuation character ( Pd ) .
Does n’t this break ISO 8859 - 1 compatibility ?
A : No .
The ISO 8859 - 1 standard defines the SOFT HYPHEN as " [ a ] graphic character that is imaged by a graphic symbol identical with , or similar to , that representing hyphen " ( section 6.3.3 ) , but does not specify details of how or when it is to be displayed , nor other details of its semantics .
The soft hyphen has had a long history of legacy implementation in two or more incompatible ways .
Unicode clarifies the semantics of this character for Unicode implementations , but this does not affect its usage in ISO 8859 - 1 implementations .
Processes that convert back and forth may need to pay attention to semantic differences between the standards , just as for any other character .
In a terminal emulation environment , particularly in ISO - 8859 - 1 contexts , one could display the soft hyphen as a hyphen in all circumstances .
The change in semantics of the Unicode character does not require that implementations of terminal emulators in other environments , such as ISO 8859 - 1 , make any change in their current behavior .
Thus , the FAQ entry admits that the meaning of the soft hyphen as defined in ISO 8859 - 1 is not the same as in the Unicode standard .
It even warns about “ semantic differences between the standards ” , which is more than just saying that ISO 8859 - 1 is vague or has been implemented in different ways .
Although the soft hyphen has reasonably well - defined semantics in the HTML context since HTML 4.0 , it has not become popular .
One reason to this has been poor browser support .
However , it now seems that the Web is finally ready for the use of soft hyphens as hyphenation hints without serious drawbacks , as far as browsers are considered .
Reasonably new versions of major browsers either support the soft hyphen or at least graciously ignore it , i.e. display words as if they contained no soft hyphens .
Thus , you can write long words in HTML documents so that they contain hyphenation hints , e.g. hy­phen­ated .
You can use the entity reference ­ or the soft hyphen character itself , if you just know how to enter it ( e.g. , by typing Alt 0173 on Windows ) .
In the latter case , the HTML source is more readable , but your web page creation program probably either does not display the soft hyphen visibly at all or displays it the same way as the normal hyphen .
It took a long time to get there , though .
The treatment of soft hyphens in web browsers made it impractical to use the character on web pages for many years .
For example , ( at least some versions of ) Netscape 4 and Internet Explorer 4 basically treated soft hyphens as plain data characters which are always visible .
IE 4 may divide a word into two lines where a soft hyphen occurs , but it does the same for normal hyphens .
It was frustrating to see the appearance of your document improve on some browsers but look very foolish on browsers that display your text as explicitly hy - phen-ated !
Even stranger things have happened .
For example , a blog discussion Hyphens a soft problem ( in 2004 ) mentions even situations where soft hyphen is rendered as a breve ( an accent on blank ) .
Internet Explorer versions from IE 5 onwards treat soft hyphens as discretionary , i.e. they do not display them as a rule but may split a word at a soft hyphen ( and then append a hyphen at the end of a line ) .
This is the intended behavior according to HTML 4 specifications .
Lynx 2.8.2 treats soft hyphens as discretionary .
Netscape ignored soft hyphens .
The same applied to Firefox uo to Firefox 2.0 .
That is , the text was presented as if they were not present at all .
Thus , on those browsers , soft hyphens caused no harm , but neither did they help .
CSS improvements in Firefox 3 included support to soft hyphens .
Opera also used to ignore soft hyphens , but at least in version 9.02 , it now treats them as discretionary .
I have written a simple test document for checking how browsers deal with soft hyphens .
Note that if a user copies and pastes text from a web page into Microsoft Word , all soft hyphens become visible , because Word treats the soft hyphen as a normal graphic character .
They can be removed , though , or even replaced by Word ’s own discretionary hyphen , using the Edit / Replace command in an advanced way .
Similar issues are raised in general when copy and paste is used , e.g. to quote a web page in e-mail .
Soft hyphen and search engines
Search engines may treat the soft hyphen as yet another punctuation character , as a separator between “ words ” , or in some special way .
They might also completely ignore it , and this would best match the Unicode semantics .
Google originally treated the soft hyphen as dividing a string into parts , or “ words ” .
Thus , when “ discretionary ” is written using soft hyphens , “ dis­cretion­ary ” , Google treated it the same way as “ dis cretion ary ” .
However , it seemed to treat them as non-consecutive words , making things even worse .
MSN Search ( Live Search ) probably still has the problem .
As usual , search engine behavior may vary rather unpredictably .
Thus , to be on the safe side , you might want to make sure that a spelling with soft hyphens is not the only version of an important content word on a page .
That is , you would include it at least once as a whole word .
Yahoo and AltaVista seem to ignore soft hyphens .
Soft hyphen and word processors
Some word processors , such as WordPerfect , implement the soft hyphen in the Unicode meaning .
However , the dominant software , Microsoft Word , treats it as a normal graphic character , which is always visible .
MS
Word has its own concept of discretionary hyphen , or optional hyphen , and you may see it called soft hyphen , too .
It can be typed using the shortcut Ctrl+hyphen or entered via the Insert / Symbol menu .
Internally , it is an Ascii control character , U+001 F .
When you copy and paste text between programs , this control character usually gets lost .
On the other hand , if you save an MS Word document in HTML format , sufficiently new versions of MS Word generate the soft hyphen character from “ optional hyphen ” .
In this rather indirect sense , MS Word thus supports the soft hyphen .
Soft hyphen in PDF
When you generate a PDF document using data that contains a soft hyphen , it may get turned to an Ascii hyphen or retained .
Even in the latter case , it appears as a visible hyphen in PDF readers .
This is in conformance with the PDF standard ( ISO 32000 - 1 , Document Management – Portable Document Format – Part 1 : PDF 1.7 , First Edition , issued in 2008 .
Its clause 14.8.2.2.3 says :
Hyphenation .
Among the artifacts introduced by text layout is the hyphen marking the incidental division of a word at the end of a line .
In Tagged PDF , such an incidental word division shall be represented by a soft hyphen character , which the Unicode mapping algorithm ( see “ Unicode Mapping in Tagged PDF ” in 14.8.2.4 , “ Extraction of Character Properties ” ) translates to the Unicode value U+00 AD .
( This character is distinct from an ordinary hard hyphen , whose Unicode value is U+002D . )
The producer of a Tagged PDF document shall distinguish explicitly between soft and hard hyphens so that the consumer does not have to guess which type a given character represents
Thus , in PDF , the soft hyphen has unambiguously a meaning as a visible character , i.e. the meaning presented in this document as the original one , and incompatible with its Unicode semantics .
Soft hyphen in PostScript
In the built - in font encoding ISOLatin1 Encoding in PostScript , the soft hyphen code is mapped to the hyphen character in the font , whereas the hyphen - minus character ( Ascii hyphen , U+002D , octal 055 ) code is mapped to the minus character .
The hyphen character is visually distinctly shorter than the minus character , so this process leads to wrong rendering .
Due to this oddity , any hyphen - minus character ( whether part of a word or introduced by a hyphenatior ) needs to be converted soft hyphen ( octal 255 ) , when generating PostScript and using ISOLatin1 Encoding .
The oddity is technically not a bug but a documented feature .
The mapping is specified in PostScript language reference , third edition , Appendix E.5 , page 781 .
Semantic complexity
In section The Unicode View above , the early formulation of the soft hyphen semantics in the Unicode standard was quoted .
It vaguely referred to differences in rendering .
Later , the description has become more and more complex .
Various versions of the line breaking rules in the Unicode standard have referred to script - specific or language - specific features of hyphenation .
It is not clear how they are meant to relate to the soft hyphen semantics .
The description of the soft hyphen in the Unicode standard itself is relatively short , since the details have been moved to Unicode Standard Annex # 14 , Unicode Line Breaking Algorithm , where the section Use of Soft Hyphen described rather complicated requirements .
The soft hyphen is defined as merely indicating “ a preferred intraword line break position ” .
This is rather abstract semantics , as compared with the semantics of Unicode characters in general .
The old name is retained , even though the character is now a format character and not a hyphen of any kind , though the formatting functionality may , in some situtations , result in the display of a hyphen at the end of a line .
Software that recognizes the soft hyphen is expected to pay attention to the writing system ( script ) and the language .
In practice , programs lack such sophisticated features .
The section on soft hyphen continues as follows :
[ …]
If the line is broken at that point , then whatever mechanism is appropriate for intraword line breaks should be invoked , just as if the line break had been triggered by another mechanism , such as a dictionary lookup .
Depending on the language and the word , that may produce different visible results — for example Simply inserting a hyphen glyph
Inserting a hyphen glyph and changing spelling in the divided word parts
Not showing any visible change and simply breaking at that point
Inserting a hyphen glyph at the beginning of the new line
Consequently , a correct implementation should never treat a soft hyphen in a simplistic manner .
It is inappropriate to break a word after a soft hyphen adding a hyphen , unless the language of the text is known and taken into account .
Treating it simply as an invisible hyphen that way would be just as arbitrary as always treating it as a simple break opportunity ( with no insertion of hyphen ) or making some random changes to word spelling when doing the division .
Yet , such simplistic manner is probably what programs do with the soft hyphen if they have any support to it in its Unicode sense .
In particular , HTML specifications explicitly require the simplistic incorrect handling .
The HTML 4.01 specification says , in section 9.3.3 Hyphenation :
Those browsers that interpret soft hyphens must observe the following semantics :
If a line is broken at a soft hyphen , a hyphen character must be displayed at the end of the first line .
If a line is not broken at a soft hyphen , the user agent must not display a hyphen character .
For operations such as searching and sorting , the soft hyphen should always be ignored .
This means that the soft hyphen should be used with care , mostly only when the author ( or someone else working on the text ) knows that the writing system uses a hyphen to indicate word division .
In complex cases like the Swedish word tillämpa , which should hyphenate into till - and lämpa ( with a total of three l letters ) , a soft hyphen should not be used unless it is known that software used for processing the text really handles this .
Rendering issues
When a soft hyphen causes a word to be hyphenated so that a hyphen is displayed at the end of a line , which character is displayed then ?
Early documents seem to take for granted that the Ascii hyphen ( called hyphen - minus in Unicode ) is used .
According to Unicode , it could be some other language - dependent hyphen , too , but assuming that the text is in English , should the character be the Ascii hyphen U+002D or the Unicode hyphen U+2010 ?
The same question also applies to hyphens introduced by hyphenation algorithms .
There is no simple and definitive answer to the question .
For all that we can know , the text might use Ascii hyphens in words that contain an explicit hyphen ( like “ time - consuming ” ) , or it might use Unicode hyphens , or even a mix of the two .
Is it acceptable that a a hyphen introduced in hyphenation looks different from an explicit hyphen ?
This even brings us back to the issue of hard vs. soft hyphens : would n’t it even be useful to be able to distinguish between them visually ?
Relatively few fonts contain a glyph for the Unicode hyphen , and even fewer have it as different from the Ascii hyphen .
It is natural to expect the Unicode hyphen to be shorter , due to its specific semantics , and e.g. the Code2000 font implements it that way .
Provided that the Unicode hyphen is available in the font used in the text , it seems logical to use it when a hyphen is to be displayed as the result of a hyphenation process .
But e.g. web browsers differ :
Internet Explorer displays the Ascii hyphen
Opera displays the Ascii hyphen oddly misplaced ( vertically raised )
Firefox displays the Unicode hyphen
Chrome mostly displays the Unicode hyphen , but in some cases ( maybe whenever the new line contains one word only ) no hyphen at all .
Concluding remarks : why did all this happen ?
Hyphenation is one part of the problems of taking various ( natural ) languages and writing systems into account on the Web , an issue called internationalization ( abbr. i18n ) or localization , for some odd reason .
It is a difficult issue , but not really among the most important in the area , except for languages with very long words and in contexts where text width is small .
Conceivably , people want fast solutions to their problems .
When we see the problems which arise from Web browsers using no hyphenation , we pay attention to the worst cases and wish we could solve at least them , and solve them now .
The simple idea of giving an explicit hyphenation hint suggests itself .
Several popular text processing programs allow you to enter “ hidden hyphenation hints ” that are normally invisible .
This is probably how people started thinking that there must be a character for the purpose , and when one looks at the ISO Latin 1 specification , what else could one use but soft hyphen ?
Moreover , people may regard the notation ­ as comparable to HTML tags .
But of course it is defined simply as a notation which stands for a single character , the soft hyphen .
Another source of confusion is that some programs implemented the Unicode semantics for the soft hyphen , but many widely used text editors and word processors did not .
Instead , program - specific methods were used for discretionary hyphen .
This resulted in problems in data interchange , making the use of soft hyphens questionable .
Revision history :
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Walking a bit more each day can help people control their Type 2 diabetes but obese people trying to keep weight off may need to exercise harder than they had thought , according to a studies published on Monday .
A jogger runs along the Hudson River in Hoboken , New Jersey in this file photo from August 3 , 2006 .
REUTERS / Gary Hershorn
Simply walking 45 minutes more each day helped people with diabetes use blood sugar better , Michael Trenell of Britain ’s Newcastle University and colleagues wrote in the journal Diabetes Care .
“ People often find the thought of going to the gym quite daunting , but what we ’ve found is that nearly everyone with diabetes is able to become more active through walking , ” Trenell said .
The Newcastle team paired 10 Type 2 diabetes patients with people without the condition of similar height , weight and age and asked everybody to walk more than 10,000 steps each day .
Magnetic resonance imaging or MRI scans showed that people who walked 45 minutes more each day burned about 20 percent more fat -- increasing the ability of the muscles to store sugar and help control diabetes , the researchers said .
“ What is exciting about this study is that it provides an immediate way to help control diabetes without any additional drugs , ” Trenell said .
Diabetes affects an estimated 246 million adults worldwide and accounts for 6 percent of all global deaths .
Type 2 diabetes accounts for about 90 percent of all diabetes cases and is closely linked to obesity and physical inactivity .
Obesity and diabetes both are growing problems as more developing nations adopt a Western lifestyle , something the International Diabetes Federation estimates will propel the number of people with diabetes to 380 million by 2025 .
But current exercise guidelines calling for people to get 150 minutes -- 2.5 hours -- each week may not be enough to help the obese keep weight off , John Jakicic of the University of Pittsburgh and colleagues wrote in the Archives of Internal Medicine .
To determine an optimal amount of exercise , the U.S. team enrolled 201 overweight and obese women in a weight loss programme between 1999 and 2003 and assigned them to one of four exercise groups .
After six months , women in all four groups had lost an average of 8 to 10 percent of their weight but many gained it back .
Women assigned to exercise for about an extra hour each day did not gain the weight back , the researchers said .
These women were also more likely to stick to healthy diets .
Jakicic recommended that people who want to lose weight and keep it off get at least 4 - 1/ 2 hours of exercise a week .
“ There is a growing consensus that more exercise may be necessary to enhance long - term weight loss , ” Jakicic and colleagues wrote .
NEW YORK �( Money Magazine ) --
The jig is up .
For years , politicians have been playing what amounts to a multi-trillion - dollar shell game with state and local pensions .
They 've doled out lush retiree benefits to their heavily unionized workforces , knowing that they could shove the cost for those benefits onto future generations of taxpayers .
But a recent financial bombshell dropped by a San Francisco suburb shows why that shell game is now starting to unravel in a nasty way .
And it 's a cautionary tale that you can't afford to ignore .
Here 's the skinny :
In late May , Vallejo , Calif. , became the largest city in California history to declare bankruptcy .
Its financial demise was brought about partly by the real estate crash , which decimated home prices in the area and put a major dent in the city 's tax revenues .
But the real nail in Vallejo 's coffin was the city 's labor costs .
Under the current labor agreement , the average police officer walking the beat in Vallejo will be paid $ 122,000 this year before overtime , according to city documents .
An average sergeant will make $ 151,000 ; a captain , $ 231,000 .
The average firefighter , meanwhile , will bring in $ 130,000 before overtime .
That 's just the salaries , though .
The final budget - crusher was the city 's pension plan .
Thanks to retroactive benefit enhancements approved by the city council in 2000 , police officers and firefighters can now retire at age 50 and receive an annual pension equal to 90 % of their final pay ( assuming 30 years on the job ) , an amount that gets increased every year to help keep pace with inflation .
The old plan had given the workers a pension equal to 60 % of their final pay at age 50 .
So a Vallejo police sergeant making $ 150,000 a year can now retire at age 50 and receive an annual pension of $ 135,000 , increased each year for inflation .
To put that amount in context , you would need to amass a retirement nest egg equal to about $ 3.5 million to produce a similar retirement income on your own .
It was n't just police and firefighters who benefited from the city 's largess .
The annual pensions for rank - and - file city employees were jacked up from 60 % of final pay at age 55 ( after a 30 - year career ) to a whopping 80 % of pay , increased each year for inflation .
Other towns in trouble
Here 's the scary part :
What 's going on Vallejo is n't unique .
Back at the turn of this century , when the stock market was still booming , public pension plans across the country were suddenly overflowing with surplus money .
Politicians responded by handing out heavily sweetened pensions .
Then , even though the stock market collapsed , politicians could n't stop the trend .
In 2001 alone , pension benefits were increased in at least 17 state plans , as well as some major cities .
For a while , inflated housing prices came to the rescue , handing many municipalities a windfall in increased property tax revenues .
Now that bubble has collapsed and the stock market is floundering .
State pension plans alone are about $ 360 billion short of the assets they should ideally hold for future retirees , according to a recent report by the Pew Center on the States .
And that 's not including city plans .
Cities and states that enriched their benefits in the past few years are especially at risk .
That 's because no matter how badly a pension plan 's investments perform , the enhanced pension benefits promised to state and local employees back in the boom times can't be taken away , or even modified - they are locked in by constitutional and legal guarantees .
There is , however , one potential option for cutting back on public pension benefits : bankruptcy .
And that 's what it has now come to in Vallejo .
Elected officials in other struggling areas will surely be watching .
Of course , nobody wins in a bankruptcy .
Vallejo must now slash services and lay off workers to make ends meet - a sad outcome for both the city workers and residents .
Bankruptcy will also wreak havoc on the city 's credit rating , making it much more expensive to borrow money for building roads and schools and maintaining the city 's infrastructure .
So what 's the lesson here ?
I 'm certainly not suggesting that state and local workers be deprived of the pensions they were promised when they started their careers .
That was part of the deal they signed up for and it should be honored .
The police and firefighters of Vallejo , for example , were told they'd get a pension equal to 60 % of their pay at age 50 , and so they should .
But the practice of retroactively boosting public sector pensions without any serious debate or approval by taxpayers has got to stop .
As the Vallejo debacle illustrates , the stakes are simply too high .
Historically , the justification for these types of pension enhancements has been that public sector workers are forgoing the salaries they would have otherwise received in the private sector , in exchange for better retirement benefits .
But that no longer seems to hold true .
According to the federal Bureau of Labor Statistics , the hourly salary ( before benefits ) of public - sector professionals ( including teachers and lawyers ) was $ 31.51 in December 2007 , virtually identical to the $ 31.75 for private - sector professionals .
Public - sector service employees ( including many blue - collar jobs ) averaged $ 16.72 an hour in salary , compared to $ 9.87 for private - sector employees .
This is an election year .
As such , many states and municipalities are under heavy pressure to sweeten the pension plans for their workers - Massachusetts , South Carolina and Pennsylvania are but three high - profile examples .
And ironically , just a few hours south of Vallejo , the city of Rialto , Calif. , recently approved a similar retroactive pension increase that will give police officers a pension equal to 90 % of their salaries at age 50 .
The bottom line :
If similar changes are being considered in your city or state , the Vallejo disaster tells you that it 's well worth your while to get the facts .
Maybe you 'll discover that your local pension fund is flush with money and that elected officials in your area have out laid out a sound , fiscally responsible plan for funding any pension improvements .
But I would n't bank on it .

A NEW form of fatal dementia has been discovered in 16 Americans , 10 of whom have already died of the condition .
It resembles Creutzfeldt - Jakob disease - with patients gradually losing their ability to think , speak and move - but has features that make it distinct from known forms of CJD .
No one yet knows how the disease originates , or under what conditions it might spread .
Nor is it clear how many people have the condition .
" I believe the disease has been around for many years , unnoticed , " says Pierluigi Gambetti , director of the US National Prion Disease Pathology Surveillance Center at Case Western Reserve University in Cleveland , Ohio .
Cases may previously have been mistaken for other forms of dementia .
Since Gambetti's team wrote a paper describing an initial 11 cases referred to his centre between 2002 and 2006 ( Annals of Neurology , vol 63 , p 697 ) , another five have come to light .
" So it is possible that it could be just the tip of the iceberg , " Gambetti says .
As in other spongiform encephalopathies , such as CJD and mad cow disease ( BSE ) , the brain tissue of victims is full of tiny holes .
This damage is thought to be caused by the accumulation of prions , misfolded versions of a brain protein called PrP that can convert normal PrP molecules into their own misshapen form .
Some features of the new disease are different , however .
All known disease - causing prions resist degradation by proteases - enzymes which digest the normal form of PrP .
But prions from patients with the new disease are broken down by the enzymes .
Some very rare forms of CJD run in families and are caused by mutations in the gene for PrP .
Six of the cases described in Gambetti's paper were from families with a history of dementia , suggesting a genetic cause .
However , these people had no mutations in their PrP genes .
" Maybe there are other genes that have an influence on the disease , " suggests James Ironside of the UK's National CJD Surveillance Unit in Edinburgh .
Most forms of CJD develop spontaneously , for unknown reasons , but can be spread if someone is exposed to brain material from people with CJD , for instance , by neurosurgery using inadequately sterilised instruments .
One variant of CJD has been linked to the consumption of contaminated meat from cattle with mad cow disease .
If the new condition is similarly caused by something in the victims ' diet , or another environmental cause , new measures might be needed to protect public health .
Gambetti is now conducting experiments in mice to see how the disease is transmitted .
He suspects that there is no cause for alarm .
" I believe the disease occurs naturally , and is not due to environmental causes , " he says .

Print This Email This Democratic National Committee Chairman Howard Dean wants things to wrap up : this morning , on CNN's Wolf Blitzer , he said of the party 's superdelegates : " I need them to say who they re for starting now . 
Watch the video here .
 We can not give up two or three months of active campaigning and healing time ,  the Democratic National Committee Chairman told CNNs Wolf Blitzer .
 Weve got to know who our nominee is . 
After facing criticism for a mostly hands - off leadership style during much of the primary season , Dean has been steadily raising the rhetorical pressure on superdelegates .
He said Thursday that roughly 65 percent of them have made their preference plain , but that more than 300 have yet to make up their minds .
The national party chair , who has remained neutral throughout the primary process , said again its his job to make sure both candidates feel they are treated fairly  but not to tell either of them when to end their run .

Several offshore wind farms are planned for the North Sea
Up to 30,000 jobs and £ 3bn in new investment could result from an expansion in offshore wind farms in the North East , the government has said .
Energy Minister Malcolm
Wicks made the prediction during a trip to an offshore research facility in Northumberland .
Mr Wicks was touring a plant in Blyth , where the world 's largest wind turbine is being developed .
His comments came as a consortium was unveiled to bid for licences to build offshore wind farms in the North Sea .
Mr Wicks was visiting the Californian - owned Clipper Wind facility at the New and Renewable Energy Centre ( NaREC ) at Blyth .
' European hub '
He said : " The North East already has a wealth of skills and experience in the manufacturing sector to diversify into the green energy market .
" The region is a pioneer in offshore wind .
Blyth was the location for the first wind turbines to be subject to the full force of the weather and waves in the North Sea .
" With our plans to increase the financial support for offshore wind , it is further evidence of our commitment to make the UK one of the most attractive places to invest in green energy . "
Meanwhile , Banks Developments , Hainsford Developments and NaREC have formed Northumbria Offshore Wind Ltd ( NOW ) , to bid for offshore licences for wind farms to be developed in the North Sea .
It is estimated around 3,000 extra offshore wind turbines will be needed to help the UK meet its target of 15 % of total energy being generated from renewable sources by 2020 .
July 11 , 2008  --
The American Medical Association has agreed to support proposed legislation that , some physicians say , could make make having a planned birth in one 's home difficult , to virtually impossible .
As of now , no actual legislation has been drawn up , but the AMA has agreed to back a measure called " Resolution 205 , " a request to support the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ' ( ACOG ) position that home births are not safe .
" We are against home births , period , " said Gregory Phillips , an ACOG spokesman .
Women who give birth outside of a clinical setting risk putting themselves and their newborns at risk , Phillips told ABCNEWS.com .
In an e-mail to ABCNEWS.com , AMA board member Steven Stack , MD , wrote that the AMA " stresses that the safest setting for delivering a baby is in the hospital or a birthing center within a hospital complex . "
The influential medical groups -- AMA and ACOG -- now find themselves at odds with those who say women should have the choice to give birth at home or in a hospital .
The American College of Nurse - Midwives has issued an unequivocal statement in support of planned home births , citing a study in the British Medical Journal that showed home births to be no riskier than hospital births .
Although only about 1 percent of babies born in the United States are born outside of a hospital , the debate has been framed in some circles as a battle between our country 's troubled medical system and mothers - to - be who want to break free of it .
ACOG 's call for support came after the release of " The Business of Being Born , " a recent documentary by former talk - show host Ricki Lake , in which she depicted the final stage of her pregnancy , up to the point of giving birth .
Lake chose to have her second child at her home in New York 's West Village with the assistance of a certified nurse midwife .
She explored , on film , the thought process behind her decision .
But it may have been the documentary 's criticism of the medical establishment , both explicit and implied , that rubbed ACOG the wrong way .
Phillips said ACOG 's decision to ask the AMA to support legislation to curtail home birthing -- as well as the prospects for what he ( and many other physicians ) consider under-qualified " lay- midwives " -- had " nothing to do with Ricki Lake . "
Yet , in the ACOG proposal to the AMA 's annual June conference , Lake was called out by name .
Abby Epstein , the film 's director , told ABCNEWS.com that the point of the documentary was not to vilify OB / GYNs .
She said that Lake 's first birth was " fantastic " and was performed at a hospital birthing center .
And , as the documentary explained , she added that she , herself , had complications that made it necessary to perform a c-section in a hospital .
But that does not mean that the tone of the documentary was uncritical of typical hospital - birth protocol .
" What the film has done is to cause a lot of women to choose midwives over OBs -- especially younger women who 've never heard of midwives , " said Epstein .
" We 've received calls from midwives saying that their practices have doubled since our film was released .
There 's a lot of ego in this -- that one would want to choose a midwife over an MD .
It 's really a turf war going back 100 years between the medical establishment and midwives . "
Phillips said ACOG 's goal is not to criminalize home birthing .
Still , the group 's moves may leave key questions unanswered :
If the medical group wishes to let the public know how it feels about home births , why not simply issue a public service announcement ?
Why the call for " legislation ? "
The relevant section of Resolution 205 , which received the AMA stamp of approval , suggests " that our American Medical Association support the recent American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists statement that ' the safest setting for labor , delivery , and the immediate post - partum period is in the hospital , or a birthing center within a hospital complex , that meets standards jointly outlined by the American Academy of Pediatrics ( AAP ) and ACOG , or in a freestanding birthing center that meets the standards of the Accreditation Association for Ambulatory Health Care , the Joint Commission , or the American Association of Birth Centers . ' "
One of ACOG 's dissenting members , Dr. Stuart Fischbein of California , told ABCNEWS.com he has no doubt ACOG wants to ban home births .
Even if officials never pass legislation , the effect of their statement -- now approved by the AMA -- will have a chilling effect on the practice , he said .
" This will trickle down to the insurance carriers .
If the AMA says home births are dangerous , fear of litigation will cause insurance carriers to refuse to support doctors who oversee midwives , " said Fischbein , who oversees four midwives in addition to his regular practice .
The effect , Fischbein added , would be that he and other doctors would be forced to drop midwives who perform home births .
ACOG has also received letters from other physicians , including Dr. Lauren Plante , an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Thomas Jefferson University in Philadelphia .
Plante wrote that she was " dismayed to read the ACOG statement opposing home birth , and specifically disallowing any support for individuals that advocate home birth . "
Plante added that " home birth remains a viable option in several developed nations where birth outcomes are excellent .
I personally know several ACOG members who , themselves , have chosen to deliver at home . "
In a letter to the ACOG board , Canadian ACOG member Dr. Andrew Kotaska wrote , " If ACOG and the AMA are passive - aggressively trying to coerce women into having hospital births by trying to legally prevent the option of home birth , then their actions are a frontal assault on women's autonomy . "
Yet , there are at least as many doctors who stand on the other side of the fence , who believe that , until more studies are done in the United States , ACOG and the AMA are on the right track .
Dr. Erin Tracy , a delegate to last month 's AMA convention and an OB / GYN who works out of Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston , told ABCNEWS.com that even in healthy women , potentially fatal complications can arise that can only be successfully resolved in a hospital setting .
" I worry about the small percentage of women who have unpredictable complications , " she said .
" The studies are conflicting .
My fear with home deliveries is that , even in the best , most capable hands , a home does n't have the equipment needed to save a life in an extreme circumstance . "
Tracy emphasized that , although the AMA 's resolution calls for legislation , at no time in the conference was there any talk of criminalizing women who have home births .
Nevertheless , that 's what it looks like to home birth advocates like Debbie Young , president of DONA International , an organization of doulas .
Doulas are assistants who give emotional support and look after the physical comfort of the delivering mother .
They generally work in hospitals and birthing centers alongside doctors and midwives .
Young said her 5,500 members would n't be professionally affected if legislation was passed , but they are " all about patient choice .
We want women to be able to choose for themselves . "
Eliot Spitzer , in his first big business venture since he was shamed out of office by a prostitution scandal , is shopping around a plan to start a vulture fund that would scoop up distressed real estate assets around the country , revamp them , and flip the properties for a profit .
Late last month , the former governor of New York gathered a group of high - level Washington , D.C. - based labor union officials in a conference room at the headquarters of his father 's real estate business in Manhattan and pitched them his idea for starting such a fund , a source said .
During the meeting , Mr. Spitzer expressed relief that he was no longer burdened with the frustrations of being governor , according to the source .
And , in contrast to his repentant resignation speech that he delivered beside his tearful wife , Silda Wall , he took a more relaxed view of his indiscretions .
He has told friends and associates that he is consoled by passersby who stop him on the city sidewalks and tell him that sex is " no big deal " and that the disclosure that he frequented prostitutes was distorted out of proportion , the source said .
Europeans , the former governor has noted , have been especially supportive of him and perplexed by the fallout from the scandal .
In the half - hour meeting , Mr. Spitzer told the officials that he was determined to take his ailing father 's real estate company to " the next level , " the source said .
Mr. Spitzer said he would lay out his business plan in greater detail at a later date , and would ask the labor officials to consider investing pension fund money under their control .
Mr. Spitzer is moving aggressively to occupy a niche created by the credit crunch , the subprime mortgage crisis , a surge in foreclosures , and a declining real estate market .
He is looking to mine for riches in projects that banks are no longer willing to finance .
Distressed real estate funds  also known as " vulture " or , more euphemistically , " opportunity " funds  typically promise returns of more than 20 % and are active in Florida , Nevada , and Southern California .
They rely heavily on pension and university endowment investments .
Mr. Spitzer is said to be envisioning projects valued between $ 100 million and $ 500 million .
Mr. Spitzer , who would be competing against much larger investors , such as the Blackstone Group and the Carlyle Group , is seeking to leverage the reputation of his father 's business as a successful manager of real estate assets .
In approaching the national labor unions , he is also trading on the goodwill he earned in that sector during his days as attorney general , when he was known as the scourge of Wall Street .
In doing so , Mr. Spitzer , who turns 49 today , is attempting to breathe life into the real estate empire built by his octogenarian father , Bernard Spitzer , whose real estate holdings , which include the Corinthian apartment building on East 38th Street , have not changed significantly since the early 1990s .
Mr. Spitzer works out of the Crown Building at 730 Fifth Ave. , a 26 - story structure his father and two other real estate investors bought in 1991 ( in what turned out to be a highly lucrative investment ) .
Playboy Enterprises leases commercial space in the building .
Speaking to the union leaders , Mr. Spitzer noted that the conference room in which they were sitting would have been his personal office had he entered his father 's business after graduating from college , a source said .
Mr. Spitzer 's entrepreneurial activities are the latest indication that the former governor is plunging himself more deeply into a life of business , rather than following , for instance , the model set by a former British war minister , John Profumo , who spent the rest of his life volunteering for a charity after he was caught in a scandal involving a prostitute and a Russian spy .
Mr. Spitzer , who resigned in March just days after it emerged that he had hired high - priced call girls while serving as governor , is quickly making the transition to real estate power player even as his legal standing is in limbo .
While two women who operated the call girl ring connected to Mr. Spitzer have pleaded guilty to money laundering and prostitution - related charges , federal prosecutors have not given any signal as to whether they will charge Mr. Spitzer with a crime .
Mr. Spitzer , who has not spoken substantively to the press since he resigned , did not return a call for comment .

An article co-written by a former Congressman and carried by the San Francisco Chronicle has gained much attention recently as it shines light on a coordinated federal government program to build detention camps at undisclosed locations within the United States .
" Since 9/11 , and seemingly without the notice of most Americans , the federal government has assumed the authority to institute martial law , arrest a wide swath of dissidents ( citizen and noncitizen alike ) , and detain people without legal or constitutional recourse in the event of an emergency influx of immigrants in the U.S. , or to support the rapid development of new programs . " write Lewis Seiler and former Congressman Dan Hamburg of the watchdog group Voice of the Environment , Inc .
Voice of the Environment ’s mission is to educate the public regarding the transfer of public trust assets into private , mostly corporate , hands .
The article continues :
Beginning in 1999 , the government has entered into a series of single - bid contracts with Halliburton subsidiary Kellogg , Brown and Root ( KBR ) to build detention camps at undisclosed locations within the United States .
The government has also contracted with several companies to build thousands of railcars , some reportedly equipped with shackles , ostensibly to transport detainees .
According to diplomat and author Peter Dale Scott , the KBR contract is part of a Homeland Security plan titled ENDGAME , which sets as its goal the removal of " all removable aliens " and " potential terrorists . "
Seiler and Hamburg also warn of the alarming and numerous freedom killing pieces of legislation that have been passed recently , dovetailing with the build up of infrastructure of tyranny inside the US .
We have previously highlighted the shocking details behind this shining example of modern day corporate fascism .
The issue gained national attention two years ago when it was announced that Kellogg , Brown and Root had been awarded a $ 385 million dollar contract by Homeland Security to construct detention and processing facilities in the event of a national emergency .
The language of the preamble to the agreement veils the program with talk of temporary migrant holding centers , but it is made clear that the camps will also be used " as the development of a plan to react to a national emergency . "
Following the story , first given wide attention by Prisonplanet.com , the Alternet website put together an alarming report that collated all the latest information on plans to initiate internment of political subversives and Muslims after the next major terror attack in the US .
The article highlighted the disturbing comments of Sen. Lindsey Graham , who encouraged torture supporting then Attorney General Alberto Gonzales to target , " Fifth Columnists " Americans who show disloyalty and sympathize with " the enemy , " whoever that enemy may be .
It is important to stress that the historical precedent mirrors exactly what the Halliburton camp deal outlines .
Oliver North ’s Reagan era Rex 84 plan proposed rounding up 400,000 refugees , under FEMA , in the event of " uncontrolled population movements " over the Mexican border into the United States .
The real agenda , just as it is with Halliburton ’s gulags , was to use the cover of rounding up immigrants and illegal aliens as a smokescreen for targeting political dissidents .
From 1967 to 1971 the FBI kept a list of persons to be rounded up as subversive , dubbed the " ADEX " list .
According to author Naomi Wolf , the National Counterterrorism Center today holds the names of roughly 775,000 " terror suspects " with the number increasing by 20,000 per month .
Discussions of federal concentration camps are no longer the rhetoric of paranoid Internet conspiracy theorists , they are mainstream news .
Halliburton , through their KBR subsidiary , is the same company that built most of the major new detention camps in Iraq and Afghanistan .
KBR have been embroiled in a human sex slave trade that their representatives have lobbied to continue .
We have a company that has been handed a contract to build prison camps in America that is engaged in trafficking young girls and women .
Can this horror movie get any more frightening ?
Sadly , yes .
A much discussed and circulated report , the Pentagon ’s Civilian Inmate Labor Program , has recently been updated and the revision details a " template for developing agreements " between the Army and corrections facilities for the use of civilian inmate labor on Army installations . "
The plan is clearly to swallow up disenfranchised groups like prisoners , immigrants and Muslims at first and then extend the policy to include ‘ Fifth Columnists , ’ otherwise known as anyone who disagrees with the government or exercises their Constitutional rights .
Respected author Peter Dale Scott speculated that the " detention centers could be used to detain American citizens if the Bush administration were to declare martial law . "
Daniel Ellsberg , former Special Assistant to Assistant Secretary of Defense , called the plan , " preparation for a roundup after the next 9/11 for Mid-Easterners , Muslims and possibly dissenters .
They ’ve already done this on a smaller scale , with the ‘ special registration ’ detentions of immigrant men from Muslim countries , and with Guantanamo . "
George Bush has declared himself to be dictator and to have supreme power over and above the limitations of the US Constitution .
Bush administration officials like Alberto Gonzales have declared Bush to be " above the law . "
White House advisors are openly discussing the legality of crushing a child ’s testicles as part of the war on terror .
Preparation for the internment of thousands of Americans who are ‘ disloyal ’ in times of emergency are afoot .
Under the enemy combatant designation anyone at the behest of the US government , even if they are a US citizen , can be kidnapped and placed in an internment facility forever without trial .
Jose Padilla , an American citizen , spent over four years in a Navy brig before being brought to trial .
In 2002 , FEMA sought bids from major real estate and engineering firms to construct giant internment facilities in the case of a chemical , biological or nuclear attack or a natural disaster .
Okanogan County Commissioner Dave Schulz went public three years ago with his contention that his county was set to be a location for one of the camps .
Furthermore , in May 2006 , we exposed the existence of a nationwide FEMA program which is training Pastors and other religious representatives to become secret police enforcers who teach their congregations to " obey the government " in preparation for the implementation of martial law , property and firearm seizures , mass vaccination programs and forced relocation .
A whistleblower who was secretly enrolled into the program told us that the feds were clandestinely recruiting religious leaders to help implement Homeland Security directives in anticipation of a potential bio- terrorist attack , any natural disaster or a nationally declared emergency .
The first directive was for Pastors to preach to their congregations Romans 13 , the often taken out of context bible passage that was used by Hitler to hoodwink Christians into supporting him , in order to teach them to " obey the government " when martial law is declared .
It was related to the Pastors that quarantines , martial law and forced relocation were a problem for state authorities when enforcing federal mandates due to the " cowboy mentality " of citizens standing up for their property and second amendment rights as well as farmers defending their crops and livestock from seizure .
It was stressed that the Pastors needed to preach subservience to the authorities ahead of time in preparation for the round - ups and to make it clear to the congregation that " this is for their own good . "
Pastors were told that they would be backed up by law enforcement in controlling uncooperative individuals and that they would even lead SWAT teams in attempting to quell resistance .
Though some doubted the accuracy of this report at the time due to its fundamentally disturbing implications , the story was later confirmed by a KSLA 12 news report , in which participating clergy and officials admitted to the existence of the program .
What could the government be contemplating that leads it to make contingency plans to detain without recourse millions of its own citizens ?
ask Lewis Seiler and Dan Hamburg in the conclusion to their article .
The answer clearly lies in the fact that over the past decade we have witnessed an extreme acceleration of the physical implementation of a framework and infrastructure ready to receive those who will not go along with a coordinated destruction of traditional American values and freedom .

America 's famed love affair with the car is spending more and more time at marriage counselling .
Texas oil has fuelled Houston 's economic boom
The price of petrol , fears about global warming - yes , even in America , more and more people are afraid that the planet might explode - the daily misery of traffic jams , parking tickets and speed cameras have all become passion killers .
The love affair is really a drawn - out marriage clinging to its vows , beset by a throbbing midlife crisis .
It is high time we reflected on how much influence the marriage has had .
On the canvass of America 's vast landscape , the combination of the motorcar and cheap oil have done nothing less than shape the physical appearance of the country and the way we live our lives .
From 12 - lane highways , drive - in fast - food joints , strip malls and the rash of exurbs , to obesity , audio books and handless mobile phones , the car has perhaps done more than any other inanimate object to shape our environment .
Cluster of skyscrapers
By the time of his or her death , the average adult in America will have spent several years of his or her life in a car .
And the residents of Houston , Texas , spend considerably more time driving than the average American .
I was there for two days this week to host a BBC World debate on the future of oil .
It was the perfect place to confront some of the crude truths about crude and its most famous by - product , the motorcar .
Houston would probably not even exist without the car .
The city of 2.8 million people - in the next few years it is set to overtake Chicago as America 's third largest city - is really a rosetta of suburbs and exurbs stretching between downtown and the airport .
Oil addiction has become too costly for our pockets , our planet and security
Send us your comments Downtown is a cluster of skyscrapers .
The dreaming corporate spires of Big Oil , a dozen high - rise car parks - in other cities the space might have been used for department stores or cinemas - and an alarming number of high - rise jails next to high - rise courthouses .
Here , the only people walking on the street are the homeless .
Most people stay in their cars or in their offices with the air conditioning turned down to arctic levels .
The population darts from furnace heat to freezing cold .
Not surprisingly , a disproportionate number of people seem to be suffering from snivelling colds in the middle of summer .
Houston is not so much a city but a climatic disaster masquerading as one .
Small steps
Even before global warming , the place was hot - and if it had not been for the black gold of Texas , not many people would have bothered to live here .
But Bill
White , the affable mayor of Houston who used to be Bill Clinton 's deputy energy secretary , knows that oil wealth cannot be relied upon indefinitely , so he has tried to wean the city off its addiction to crude and turn it into the energy capital of the world .
There are 3000 energy companies here , and although most of them make their money from oil , they are also investing in wind , water and solar power .
The parking meters downtown are powered by individual solar panels .
And the mayor , who has been re-elected three times , including once with an eye - popping 91 % of the vote , has built an electric tram in the city 's historic district .
When I looked , the carriages were mainly empty .
But at least these are small steps in the right direction .
Houston is set to overtake Chicago as America 's third - largest city
The debate took place in the splendid columned hall of the Corinthian building , a former bank now used for lavish weddings .
We had persuaded the head of Shell America , the head of Nissan America , Mayor White and two prominent energy gurus to debate the future of crude and , everyone was in agreement : we are addicted to oil .
The addiction has become too costly for our pockets , our planet and security .
Even the oil man agreed that his company Shell Oil might be called something different ten years from now .
It is not that oil is running out - this we also established is a fallacy .
But we do not need it to run out for us to change our ways .
As Sheikh Yamani , the former Saudi Oil Minister , said in 1973 during the first oil shock : " The stone age did n't end because we ran out of stones . "
Revolution
The question is , can we all come to the table at the same time to bring about real change ?
Will the car - makers produce a mass - consumption electric vehicle with efficient batteries that people want to buy ?
The man from Nissan told me that such a vehicle will be on sale in the US by 2010 .
We will be recharging our car batteries much as we recharge our phone batteries .
Will governments provide the right legislation to encourage new industries or are we just going to carry on drilling ?
Will the oil companies use more of their profits to invest in alternative energy ?
And most importantly , will we the addicts , the consumers , go along with it ?
This must be a revolution driven from below .
Unlike in 1973 , today 's oil shock is not caused by the suppliers but by the consumers .
In America , on average , almost every citizen owns a vehicle .
In China , it is a tenth of the population .
If the Chinese want to drive like us in the future , using the same fuel , we really will despair .
In fact it simply will not be an option .
The Chinese know this , which is why they are leapfrogging us in the development of alternative energy sources .
They simply have no choice .
As gas creeps above $ 4.50 ( £ 2.25 ) a gallon , it is easy to blame Big Oil for our big headaches .
But although the oil companies are making a mint , they at least provide a counterweight to the really BIG Oil companies in Opec , like Saudi Aramco , which is 20 times the size of Shell .
Arguably the worst thing that could happen to us now is that oil goes back to $ 15 ( £ 7.50 ) a barrel .
It would make us feel richer but it could rekindle our love affair with the car and its combustion engine , deferring more pain to the future .
The car - powered by cheap petrol - has been the love of our lives .
It is time to find another lover .

What are these ?
Think of this .
You have a job where , whenever you need to , you can find the absolute truth .
When someone asks you , “ Phil , why is this happening ? ” you are 100 % confident that you can figure out the precise answer .
This is the idyllic situation many engineers on the planet Earth live in , and , well , it ’s just a great gig .
I exaggerate .
Engineers do have blind spots , but for their work , for their specific pile of bits , they are omniscient .
They ’re their bits and they constructed them into their specific system where they are intimately familiar with the rules because they defined them .
Outside of my career as an engineer , I ’ve been a store clerk , a butcher , a video rental clerk , a lawyer ’s assistant , and a bookseller , and while it ’s been over 15 years since I ’ve done any of these jobs , I remember the sense of naive pointlessness : “ What do I build ?
Well , I sell stuff , cut stuff , or type stuff .
I do n’t really build anything , I… do stuff . ”
This made the first engineering gig a revelation .
“ You .
We are building a database application and you own this specific part .
It is entirely yours .
Do n’t fuck it up . ”
Delicious , delicious structure .
Sweet , sweet definition .
These basic and essential elements of job satisfaction are at the root of why many engineers make horrible managers .
They are trained and love to be control freaks .
The New Gig
Now you have a new job .
You have an office and you have a door .
On your desk , there ’s a timer that tracks the number of seconds that it ’s just you alone in your office .
Whenever someone else walks into your office , the timer magically resets to zero .
Today ’s record for consecutive uninterrupted seconds is 47 .
This is not a world an engineer is used to , this interrupt - driven day full of people and political calculus .
This is where the reputation that your manager does nothing begins .
It ’s your manager who thinks it .
It ’s the close of the day and your manager wonders , “ Did I actually do anything today except contend with a constant stream of people coming into my office ? ”
Try as you might , the structure and definition of your quiet engineering gig is gone .
Your days of digital omniscience are over .
This is the big switch between the engineer and the manager .
You are leaving the comfortable world of bits for one of bafflingly configured atoms , where you need to figure out how to trust those you work with .
Where you need to train folks to make decisions for themselves , but also help them understand it ’s ok to escalate for help .
It ’s a gig where you need to keep track of everything , constantly re-prioritize , but remain strategically limber .
And to do all of this , you need a task tracking system that allows you to strategically forget .
The Taste of the Day
This is my system .
It ’s a mix of my ability to be a systematic thinker with the fact that there is more to do than I can ever complete .
I ’ve been using some variation of it for ten years now and it ’s how I run my day and my week .
It all orbits around a task system .
Your first question will be : “ What task tracking system do you use , Rands ? ”
The answer is a simple : “ Whatever works for you ” .
I ’ve used a homegrown Excel system , Tasks , and I ’m currently using Things , but as you ’ll see , the strategic key here is not identification of the task tracking system , it ’s using it — all the time .
This system is designed to create a living , breathing , manageable list of things you might actually do , and it starts with …
The Morning Scrub
The first task of the day is to set my head .
What kind of day am I getting myself into ?
A quick glance at the calendar gives me the first hint of what to expect .
Is this a quiet get - things - done day ?
A meeting hell day ?
Or a sky - is - falling day ?
Each day has a different taste and the Morning Scrub forces me to set my head appropriately .
It gives me a rough sense of my capacity , the people I ’ll meet , and what they might need .
More importantly , it reminds me that Priority is Relative .
Humans suffer from bright ’n’shiny complex , where we ’re titillated by the new .
Think of it like this : have you actually done anything with that last domain you bought ?
No .
You had the idea for it on Tuesday morning and you got all fired up , so you bought the domain the moment you got in to work .
At lunch you furiously doodled your design in your notebook , fully intending to get home and get started on the HTML / CSS , and then you got home … and watched Lost .
Take the bright ’n’shiny complex and apply it to your entire group , where everyone is prioritizing their day by their particular inspiration and you ’ll realize it ’s shocking that we ever collectively get anything done .
By taking a deep breath and considering your entire day , I ’m attempting to ditch all the bright ’n’shininess and gather perspective : “ What is going to matter today ? ”
With this rough priority scale in mind , I do a complete scrub of the to - do list .
Yeah , the whole thing .
If you ca n’t get through this list in 5 uninterrupted minutes , your list is either too long or you ’re bad at scrubbing .
Do n’t worry about that yet .
The purpose of the Morning Scrub is to land each task into one of three buckets :
Today .
This task must be completed today .
Later .
Not today .
Later .
Never .
Yeah , I ’m never going to do this task .
It ’s gone .
This is an important essential decision that we ’ll talk about in a moment .
Initially , getting through this list is tricky because , invariably , a task will be so delectable that you ’ll want to jump into immediate action .
Do n’t .
The point of this scrub is not forward momentum ; it ’s complete prioritization .
Any deviation from the scrub decreases the chance you ’ll get through the whole list .
How many Today tasks are left when you ’re done with the scrub ?
I do n’t know because I do n’t know who you are or how granular your tasks are , but I usually end up with between 10 and 20 .
With the Morning Scrub complete , I create the Parking Lot .
This is a blank legal size piece of paper that sits directly to the left of the keyboard .
New sheet .
Always legal size .
Every morning .
Anyone who has sat through an offsite knows exactly what this paper is for .
It ’s the landing spot for any idea / task / thing that is worth remembering , but , if acted upon at the moment , will derail the productivity train .
Like the Morning Scrub , the art of capturing a bright ’n’shiny idea and landing it in the Parking Lot is an acquired skill .
You ’re going to want to move on the new , and sometimes that ’s the right move , but you need to honestly and quickly answer the question , “ Is moving on this new thing more important than finishing what I ’m doing right now ? ”
Practice Productivity Minimalism
As I ’ve already mentioned ( and written about ) , this is not a piece where I ’ll debate the pro/cons of various productivity tools .
You get to find a tool that fits your personal quirks , but whatever that tool is , I have some brief advice how to use it relative to assessing your personal Taste of the Day :
My task list has no hierarchical organization .
I ’ve used systems before that allow me to lump tasks by projects or by theme and , inevitably , I end up maintaining the structure rather than getting shit done .
This pisses me off .
I do use tags within
Things , but only to track who the most important person is , if anyone , for a given task .
This is a handy way to run 1:1s .
“ Show me all Bob - related things . ”
No priorities .
Really .
Again , priority is relative , and while slapping a priority on a task when you create it feels right , it ’s wrong because two days from now the priority will be different .
Priority is a big deal — as a manager you want to get the right stuff done at the right time , but the priority that matters is the one sitting in your head right now rather than the one you dreamed up a week ago .
No dates .
I ’ve got to be pissing off productivity nerds now .
I do n’t track due dates , either .
I fully scrub my to - do list every day , which means I ’m constantly making real - time calls regarding scheduling tasks .
As an engineer , your natural inclination is to build an increasingly complex system for tracking your tasks .
The risk is that the more structure you put into your list , the more you need to maintain it , and the more you maintain it , the less time you ’ll have to actually get work done .
The Evening
After work , after dinner , or just before I go to sleep , I complete another scrub .
The process for the Evening Scrub is slightly different .
First , I scrub the Parking Lot into the Later bucket .
This is the first taste I get of how the day actually went .
Lots of new tasks ?
Ok , what kind ?
With the Parking Lot scrubbed , I take a moment to size up the day .
How’d I do on taste ?
My original read was “ meeting - infested nightmare ” — was I right ?
This is another priority leveling exercise .
It does n’t matter if I made the right call on the day ; the point is to again set your head appropriately .
Finally , I scrub unfinished items in the Today bucket .
For each item remaining , I ask , “ Ok , why did n’t I get this done ? ”
Very often , the answer is , “ Not enough time ” , so the item gets thrown back into the Later bucket , but sometimes it just gets deleted .
Your question is , “ How did a task that was scrubbed into the Today bucket this morning suddenly become irrelevant ? ”
The efficient , version control - loving information pack rat in you is going to have a problem punting a task into oblivion .
Your thought is , “ Sure , it might not feel important right now , but WHAT IF !? ”
Stop .
Delete it .
We ’ve already wasted 37 seconds noodling on this semi-essential but tasteless task .
Nuke it .
By getting this task off your list and out of your head , we ’re making space .
Do n’t worry , if the task is actually important , it ’s going to find its way back to your Parking Lot .
This deletion is advanced management kung - fu and it ’s based on insight I do n’t like to give to new managers because it ’s a total productivity buzz kill .
The insight is : “ You will never complete everything you should . ”
“ Rands , I can do anything ! ”
Of course you can .
“ Do n’t tell me what I ca n ’t do ! ”
I ’m not .
What I ’m telling you is that management is the art of choosing what not to do , which means you need to be ready and willing to look at the task at the end of a day and ask , “ Ok , I made this urgent this morning .
A day has passed and I had time , but never got to it .
Does it matter ? ”
Priority is relative .
What felt so important last Wednesday loses importance five days later when the larger context of your week , your month , and your career shows up .
You need to develop a practice of strategic information shedding where you are constantly and intelligently jettisoning ideas and work .
A well maintained to - do list gives you a daily sense of professional well - being .
It constructs the pleasant illusion that you have a degree of control in a world where you have no idea how tomorrow will taste .
The system I ’ve constructed to maintain this list is lightweight , built using the practical use of constraints , designed to sift through an endless crapload of information that passes me during the day , but it ’s a system that is incomplete .
A glance at my current Parking Lot demonstrates this incompleteness .
It ’s a list of things I need to do .
It ’s a list of tactics that I need to do to keep the management engine running , but dutifully following these to - do ’s is n’t management ; it ’s task execution .
You need another list , one that represents the strategy for your team , your career , and your values .
And that one is called the Trickle List .
A Celebration of the life of
Kenneth Eugene Iverson
Ken Iverson was influential in many people 's lives .
His passing in October of 2004 has been marked by several events that celebrated his life .
The purpose of this web site is to collect some materials together in a place where they may be accessed by people looking for information about Ken and his contributions to computing , especially APL and J .
Ken and Donald McIntyre worked on what was to be " The Story of APL & J " in 2004 through a series of e-mail messages , with the last e-mail from Ken coming in the morning of Saturday , 2004 - 10 - 16 .
Donald , who passed away 2009 October 21 , felt that he wass unable to continue work on " The Story of APL & J " due to his poor health .
What remains is an autobiographical sketch of Ken .
Donald emphasizes that the text is in Ken 's own words .
The biographical sketch may be viewed here .
- Updated 2008 7 14
Roger Hui wrote a paper , Remembering Ken Iverson to be published in VECTOR , the British journal of APL and j .
Additionally , he has very thoughtfully collected together various eulogies that may be viewed here .
- Updated 2010 1 25
Many people have recalled Quotations and Anecdotes of and about Ken and their interactions with him over the years .
Roger has collected a number of those and created an interesting perspective of Ken 's life which continues to evolve and may be viewed here .
- Updated 2016 11 27
There was a evening of celebration at the Computer History Museum and for that event Eugene McDonnell provided a collection of caricatures , created by his son Peter , that portray some of the people who were influenced deeply by Ken .
You can view the resulting slide show here .
A video of the presentations at the celebration is available from the Computer History Events pages .
A celebration was also held in Toronto .
Catherine Lathwell has graciously spent a lot of work on a video presentation of excerpts from that celebration .
View it here .
The last 17 years of Ken 's life were devoted to creating and enhancing j , much of that work can be seen in j help and reference material .
The British APL Association website VECTOR has lots of information about APL , J , and K as well as many remembrances of Ken .
Various people have contributed things related to Ken and APL and j .
A collection of those , thoughtfully indexed by Roger Hui , can be viewed and / or downloaded here .
Michael Montalbano , in October 1982 , published an IBM Technical Report describing an APL History from a personal perspective .
Michael Montablano also wrote several poems and a song about APL which can be heard here .
In Michael Montalbano 's personal perspective he recalls his first acquaintance with the notation that has since become APL starting with a paper by Kenneth Iverson titled , The Description of Finite Sequential Processes .
Two important papers describing the design and evolution of APL can be found at The Design of APL
and The Evolution of APL both authored by A.D. Falkoff and K.E. Iverson .
These and many other relevant papers can be found in the jsoftware papers repository .

Griselda Blanco has acquired many monikers in her 65 years .
The Colombian drug dealer earned the title of " Cocaine Queen " in Seventies New York , and she became La Madrina — a .k.a.
" The Godmother " — when she moved her operations to Miami .
Because of her tendency to bump off her own husbands , three in all , she has also been dubbed " Black Widow . "
Blanco got busted in California in 1985 , and she was subsequently convicted in federal court of conspiring to import cocaine .
The conviction made the nightly news , which is how Charles Cosby , a small - time street hustler from Oakland , California , learned about her .
He was gob - smacked , he says .
" My drug dealing was confined to the hood , " he recounts in a telephone interview from California .
" I could n't see beyond the ghetto .
I never knew anything about the higher echelons . "
Info Griselda Blanco
Cosby saw Blanco as a role model , someone to be emulated .
In 1991 , he sent a fan letter to her California prison cell , and she wrote back .
The two struck up a fast correspondence friendship .
Authorities would n't let Cosby , then 23 , meet the 51 - year - old Blanco in person because , he says , he was on probation for carrying a machine gun .
But after months of written exchanges plus daily phone conversations , Cosby finally got cleared for a jailhouse visit .
" I 'll never forget it , " he says .
" When the officers brought her in , everything stopped .
She commanded the attention of the entire room .
She was beautiful .
She immediately embraced me and stuck her tongue in my mouth . "
According to authorities , Griselda Blanco was behind many of the murders that rocked Miami in the late Seventies and early Eighties as cocaine dealers resurrected the murderous mayhem of Prohibition - era Chicago .
In the midst of the torrid cocaine wars , hundreds of people were killed — flattened by machine guns , murdered execution - style on back streets , sometimes rubbed out in public places in the bright Florida sunshine .
Blanco is a central yet elusive character in the 2006 documentary Cocaine Cowboys , which chronicles the way Miami flourished with drug money .
When researching the movie , director Billy Corben and producer Alfred Spellman came across photos of Cosby .
The documentary - makers , who are about to release a straight - to - DVD sequel titled Cocaine Cowboys II : Hustlin ' with the Godmother , July 29 , say they often wondered , Who is this young black man ?
They were unable to locate him .
After Cocaine Cowboys was released , Cosby found them .
The filmmakers invited him to Miami , where they run a production company called Rakontur , to record an interview they could tag on to the DVD as an extra feature .
Meanwhile , fans were clamoring for more information about La Madrina .
" There 's surprisingly very little out there about somebody who was responsible for much of the Wild West activity in Miami , " Spellman marvels .
" The one character that did n't speak in Cocaine Cowboys was the one that everyone wanted to hear about . "
Via a lawyer , Blanco had declined the Rakontur team 's request for an interview .
In 2004 , she was released from prison and deported to Colombia .
Now , here was this guy who knew her on an intimate level , wanting to share his memories .
Corben and Spellman say they decided to tell Griselda Blanco 's story through Charles Cosby .
" Out of all the people Griselda did business with , so many of them are dead , " Spellman says .
" That makes it almost impossible to develop any kind of first - person narrative .
That 's why Charles is so important . "
Cosby is the central narrator in Rakontur 's new 97 - minute film , which Magnolia Pictures will issue on disc .
It 's one of several sequels Rakontur hopes to turn out , with each focusing on different personalities from the Miami cocaine wars .
The first Cocaine Cowboys became a runaway underground hit , especially with the urban crowd , helped immensely by South Florida rappers such as Trick Daddy and Pitbull shooting video shoutouts for the flick .
When Cosby first met Blanco , he says , she was still in the drug business , by her own estimates pulling in $ 50 million a year while behind bars .
Cosby had hit the big time .
A few days after the visit , Blanco sent two boxes full of coke to his house as a first installment in their fireball relationship .
Within weeks , Cosby was a millionaire .
The second time he saw Blanco , they retreated into a prison closet for rapid - fire sex .
The guards were in on it : Blanco uninhibitedly handed out bribes .
As such , she enjoyed privileges like those quickies with Cosby , and she was allowed to dress in silk suits instead of jailhouse scrubs , Cosby says .
The new documentary does n't quite match the high - speed intensity of the first Cocaine Cowboys , which made Miami Vice and Scarface seem almost tame by comparison .
But Cosby knows how to spin a good yarn — he relates disturbing tales with engaging detail in a nonchalant tone .
The film begins in California , focusing on Cosby 's entry into the crack business .
It 's a sharp detour from the Miami drug scene , with old photos of Cosby looking like a character from Boyz n the Hood .
There 's even a demonstration of how to condense cocaine into crack on a stovetop .
Cosby offers a street - level glimpse at the impact the Colombian Cocaine Queen had on a single community — it 's a scene that was playing out in neighborhoods across the nation .
Blanco is thought to have smuggled tons of powdered cocaine into the United States during her heyday .
I 'm giving a talk to a group of students ( grades 10 , 11 , 12 ) at the end of April , who are attending a Math Camp at my University .
The talk is called " What I Wish I Knew About Math In High School " and I 'd like to discuss things that I 've discovered about math that I think are really cool , but you would never have been encouraged to learn about while you were in high school .
The current high school curriculum focuses on algebra , trig , and ( in the later years ) pre-calculus , which is an amazingly small portion of what math has to offer .
I 'm interested in hearing what type of things the hive mind finds fascinating about math .
These topics should be relatively easy for anyone to understand ( after a brief explanation ) , and have some sort of " wow " factor to them .
Bonus points if you can apply it somehow to " real " life .
An example could be the Golden Ratio , since it has roots which are purely mathematical , but is debated to be found in nature , art , and music .
The humble and charming tugboat emits more soot for the amount of fuel it uses than any other commercial vessel , according to a new study that also finds cargo ships emit more than twice as much as previously thought .
The findings bode ill for the Arctic , in particular , where a rapidly melting ice cap allow for more commercial ship travel .
In particular , a long - sought Northwest Passage opened last summer and could become navigable again this year .
In fact the very North Pole could be ice - free later this year , scientists said recently .
The researchers worry that the extra soot could exacerbate Arctic melting .
Small dark soot particles absorb sunlight , create haze , and affect how clouds form and make rain , further altering a region 's heat balance , the researchers say .
If commercial shipping extends new routes through Arctic waters as they become navigable , soot emissions there could increase .
Previous studies have concluded that soot could hasten Arctic melting .
Dirty shipping
Commercial shipping releases roughly 130,000 metric tons of soot per year , or 1.7 percent of the global total -- much of it near highly populated coastlines , the authors estimate .
In the coming years global shipping is expected to grow two to six percent annually .
Oceangoing tankers and container ships emit half a gram of soot per kilogram of fuel burned when at dock and slightly less when traveling , according to scientists from the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) and the University of Colorado ( CU ) who conducted the new study .
Tugs emit nearly a gram of soot per kilogram of fuel burned — twice as much as any other vessel type , the authors find .
" Tugboats are a huge source of black carbon that may be under - reported or not reported at all in emissions inventories compiled by ports , " says the study lead author Daniel Lack of NOAA 's Earth System Research Laboratory ( ESRL ) and the NOAA - CU Cooperative Institute for Research in Environmental Sciences .
The finding will be detailed in the July 11 issue of the journal Geophysical Research Letters , a journal of the American Geophysical Union .
The research was funded by NOAA .
Exceptionally high soot levels from tugboats point to their low - quality fuel — a thick , black tar left over from crude oil after the gasoline and kerosene have been removed .
Engine age and maintenance also play a role .
Tugboats have a disproportionate impact on air quality because they travel within ports , emitting potentially harmful particles near populous urban areas , the researchers point out .
About the study
To investigate ship emissions , the researchers observed plumes from commercial vessels in open ocean waters , channels , and ports along the southeastern United States and Texas during the summer of 2006 .
From the NOAA research vessel , Ronald H. Brown , the team measured black carbon emitted by tankers , cargo and container ships , large fishing boats , tug boats , and ferries , many of them in the Houston Ship Channel .
" Commercial shipping emissions have been one of the least studied areas of all combustion emissions , " Lack said .
" The two previous studies of soot emissions examined a total of three ships .
We reviewed plumes from 96 different vessels . "
A 2007 study by American and German scientists linked particle pollution from shipping to tens of thousands of premature deaths each year , most of them along coastlines in Europe , East Asia , and South Asia .
Soot makes up a quarter of that pollution , Lack said .
The primary sources of soot , or small particles of black carbon , are fossil fuel combustion , wildfires , and burning vegetation for agricultural purposes .
On a global scale , soot currently traps about 30 percent as much heat as does carbon dioxide , the most important greenhouse gas , according to the latest assessment of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change .
After the 2004 election Holt proposed the “ Voter Confidence and Increased Accessibility Act . ” GOP objects to bill allowing recounts
Voting rights activists who hoped the federal government would help local governments pay for paper trails and audits for electronic voting machines have gone from elation to frustration as they watched Republicans who supported such a proposal in committee vote against bringing it to the House floor .
The result :
The elections in November will likely be marred by the same accusations of fraud and error involving voting machines that arose in the aftermath of the 2004 presidential race .

When New Jersey Democratic Rep. Rush Holt ’s Emergency Assistance for Secure Elections
Act came up for a vote in the House Administration Committee on April 2 , the Republicans on the committee gave it their unanimous support .
But two weeks later , those same Republican members voted against moving the bill to the House floor .
It would have taken a two - thirds vote to push the bill to the floor ; with most House Republicans opposed , the bill did n’t make it that far .
Larry Norden , director of the voting technology project at the Brennan Center for Justice at New York University ’s law school , called the vote “ a sad statement on how little Congress has done on the issue of making sure elections are as secure and reliable as possible . ”
In May 2003 , Holt proposed the Voter Confidence and Increased Accessibility Act .
That bill would have mandated a paper trail for voting machines so that voters could verify their vote and a recount could be performed , if necessary .
The measure faced conservative objections on states ’ rights grounds and failed to make much headway .
So Holt introduced his new bill in January .
Under the Emergency Assistance for Secure Elections
Act , the federal government would help localities switch to paper ballots or attach printers to their electronic voting machines in time for the November elections .
To overcome states ’ rights objections , Holt crafted the bill as an opt-in : Nobody would be required to switch technologies or conduct audits , but federal funding would be available to offset costs for those who did .
Without a mandate , Holt ’s bill drew more bipartisan support ; Rep. Tom Davis ( R - Va. ) was one of the 92 co-sponsors .
“ We need standards to ensure that things are auditable , verifiable and give the voters confidence , and [ Davis ] does n’t think that what we have now does that , ” said Davis spokesman Brian McNicoll .
“ The principle reason for the bipartisan consensus is that this was opt - in , ” Holt told Politico after the bill passed committee .
“ Everybody , Democrat and Republican , would prefer fewer disputed elections and better ways of resolving disputes .
You ca n’t resolve disputes without a paper trail . ”
But Holt ’s bill hit a snag on April 15 when the White House put out a statement of opposition on the grounds that it was unnecessary to spend the money appropriated in the bill when funding could come instead from the Help America Vote Act .
Republicans say it was the bill ’s cost , not the White House ’s opposition , that caused them to change their votes .
“ The version that passed committee on April 2 did not authorize a specific dollar amount , ” said Salley Collins , a spokeswoman for Republicans on the Administration Committee .
“ We did n’t receive the [ Congressional Budget Office ] score until the 14th of April , one day before it went to the floor . …
So we did not know that the proposed legislation would cost $ 685 million — $ 50 million more than Holt ’s first version . ”
Holt and his staff dismissed that objection .
“ There ’s no reason to expect it would actually cost $ 680 million , ” he said , arguing that the $ 680 million estimate assumes more local governments will opt in than he believes is likely .
Republicans also cited concerns regarding implementation .
Collins said Holt ’s bill is “ overly prescriptive with the hand recounts , ” and she suggested that it might not be realistic to expect local governments to adopt new technologies in such a short timeframe .
“ It could wreak havoc on a hotly contested election , ” she said .
Holt says these issues are red herrings :
Because of the opt - in nature of the bill , any state worried that it could not complete the process in time could simply choose not to participate .
While some election reform activists would have preferred a mandatory bill , many saw it as the best they could hope to get in time for the next election .
“ On Election Day , if machines are breaking down and there are no paper ballots , the failure of this bill will be one place to look for explanations , ” said Norden .
Holt is predicting exactly that :
Ultimately , he said , the bill ’s failure will mean that “ millions of voters will leave the 2008 election questioning the process and whether their vote means anything . ”

JavaScript functions are versatile .
They are powerful and flexible and exotic like a carnival contortionist .
It ’s amazingly easy to get into trouble with them .
Not just small trouble , but big - time Pinocchio - hanging - out - with - Lampwick trouble .
Here ’s a great way to get sucked into some such trouble :
var i ; for ( i=0 ; i< 5 ; i++ ) { setTimeout ( function ( ) {alert ( ' The number is '+i ) ;} , 5000 ) ; }
I think most programmers would expect this code to give you five alerts , and that the alerts would look like this :
The number is 0
The number is 1
The number is 2
The number is 3
The number is 4
But that ’s not how it works .
Instead , you get this :
The number is 5
The number is 5
The number is 5
The number is 5
The number is 5
What ’s happening ?
The inside function ( the one in the setTimeout call ) is a closure .
A closure has access to its parent function ’s variables , even after the parent function is done .
In this case , we ’re setting up five alerts .
This happens very fast , before the first alert has executed .
So by the time the alerts happen , the loop counter is 5 .
So how do you fix this ?
Well , the first answer is that it ’s a dumb way to do it .
You can pass setTimeout a string instead of a function and solve it that way , or just call one setTimeout and have that one call the next one .
But I ’ve had a problem similar to this with click handlers on a series of buttons , so let ’s go ahead and look at a real solution .
for ( i=0 ; i< 5 ; i++ ) { ( function ( num ) { setTimeout ( function ( ) {alert ( ' second '+ num ) ; },5000 ) ; } ) ( i ) ; }
Huh ?
That looks crazy .
Let ’s figure it out .
Here ’s a function .
function lert ( ) { alert ( " Nope " ) ; }
Here ’s another function .
( function ( ) { alert ( " Yep " ) ; } ) ( ) ;
What are the differences between them ?
The first function has a name ( the name is “ lert ” ) , while the second function does not have a name .
The first function does not execute until it ’s called , but the second function executes immediately .
To get the immediate execution , we wrap the function in parentheses and follow it with another pair of parens .
That ’s just how it is –get used to it .
That ’s how our solution works , except it needs to be a bit fancier because we need to pass a parameter in .

I 'm in the airport on my way home , very tired and very happy to be going home and sad to be leaving my 18 Clarion students ( who will now have Geoff Ryman and Nalo Hopkinson for the last two weeks ) .
My mailbox is starting to fill up with questions from journalists about the announcement at San Diego that I 'll be writing a two - part Batman story for Andy Kubert to draw , that will come out in January .
They have lots and lots of questions .
So I do n't have to write lots and lots of emails back to all the journalists :
1) Yes , I am writing a two part Batman story .
2 ) Yes , Andy Kubert will be drawing it .3 ) Yes , it will be two oversized issues .
4 ) No , I do n't plan to say anything else about it until it's all written and drawn .
( I just called my Visa card to fix something , and found myself being asked if I wasNeil Gaiman .
I said yes , I was .
" So , " said the Visa person , " Are you going to be writing an episode of Dr Who ? " )

The Hillary Clinton campaign keeps ducking on the Weathermen issue that it tried to use against Barack Obama .
First , campaign communications director Howard Wolfson broke a promise to tell reporters what Clinton thought of her husband ’s 2001 pardon of two Weather Underground radicals who had gone to jail for involvement in violent crimes .
Then , yesterday , Clinton herself played dumb when asked about those pardons :
I did n’t know anything about it ?
At what point ?
The question , though , is , what do you think of those pardons ?
In this interview , Clinton said , “ When you run for president … you know that everything is going to be fair game . ”
So if you ’re going to blast an opponent for having once held a fundraiser at the apartment of William Ayers , a former Weather Underground radical , you ought to be willing to handle questions regarding your closest campaign adviser ’s decision to pardon two Weather Underground veterans .
That ’s certainly fair game .
Clarification : Clinton did not issue pardons to the two radicals ; he commuted their prison sentences .
Media accounts often conflate the two different actions .
These two commutations were announced by the White House on January 20 , 2001 , as part of a long list of almost 140 pardons and commutations , which included the infamous pardon of fugitive financier Marc Rich–which was a pardon .
Once again , digging through Apple 's XML files has revealed the url to the iPhone 2.0 Firmware that is presently available on Apple 's servers .
One of our readers found this new firmware image :
Link removed at request of Apple
This build is slightly higher than the one of the latest iPhone Firmware Beta ( 5A345 ) which was also spotted on shipping iPhone 3Gs .
Despite the filename appearing in the XML file , the actual firmware has not yet been released officially .
As well , the firmware carries a " 1,2 " designation while all previous firmwares , including the beta firmwares carried a " 1,1 " number .
Apple has posted an updated guide about firmware upgrades and warns :
Normally if you choose to update , the iPhone or iPod touch software is updated but your settings and media are not affected .
If your device currently has a software version prior to 2.0 ( 1.x ) and you are updating to software version 2.0 or later , all data on your device will be erased in order to perform install the new software .
In this case , iTunes will offer to create a one - time media backup of your device depending on what content is on your device and what content is stored in the iTunes Library you are connected to .
You should ensure that you have enough free space on your Mac or PC to accommodate a backup that matches the capacity of your iPhone or iPod touch ( 4 GB , 8 GB , 16 GB , or 32 GB ) if you proceed with the this backup .
Be sure to fully sync prior to proceeding .
In order to install this firmware , you will have to do it manually by pressing the Option key ( Shift under Windows ) when pressing the " Check for Update " button in iTunes version 7.7 .
Then select the .ipsw file manually .
If for some reason your download is a " .zip " file , rename it to " .ipsw " before proceeding .
We expect the firmware to be officially released shortly and will appear in your iTunes software update .
If you do n't wish to wait , you can use this method , but should proceed with caution and at your own risk .
That being said , there are reports of people having successfully used this firmware on the original iPhone , and are successfully downloading and running App Store apps .
Note : Can not be used for iPod touch .
@pipper : CCD and CMOS sensors are sensitive to short - wave IR light , but for daytime viewing security cameras use an IR - blocking filter that shops IR reaching the sensor and washing out the colors .
For low - light , night time use , the filter is moved out of the way .
As a result this would only work at night .
It is always wise to ask yourself whether things that you are buying will be too expensive .
This includes all sorts of loans .
You may think that it is a bit odd to say that you ‘ buy ’ a loan but actually we do pay for the loan as we have to pay fees , charges and / or interest .
This means that we are purchasing something and therefore need to make sure that we are not paying more than we can afford for it .
We also should make sure that we are not paying more than necessary .
There are therefore two things that we have to check out :
Are we Spending more than we can Afford ?
So , we need to firstly work out how much the loan will cost and then we can think about whether we can afford this .
To find out how much the loan costs could seem tricky .
If you try to work it out using the interest rate it can be complex and it might not include all of the costs as loans will often has fees as well .
Therefore , it is wise to either use a calculator , which is often included on the lender ’s website , to work out the total cost or to ask the lender to calculate it for you .
They should be able to let you know what you will have to repay in full and if you take away the amount you have borrowed you will be able to work out the cost of it .
This will allow you to think about whether you feel the loan is worth it and if you think you can afford it .
If you are borrowing for an emergency , then you might be prepared to pay a lot more for the loan compared to if you are using it to buy luxury items .
It is good to think about what you are using the money for and whether you think that it is worth paying that cost for it .
You need to think about that cost and whether you would be prepared to pay that much more for the thing that you are buying .
So imagine that the price of it was the price you are buying it for plus the cost of the loan and consider whether you would still buy it .
Are we Paying more than Necessary ?
It is also worth making sure that you are not paying more than necessary .
This is something that you will need to be able to work out if you compare the costs of different lenders .
It is good to look at different personal loans to see how the prices of those compare and work out what the cheapest on is .
Do remember that using comparison websites could help you here , but not all loans will be included on them and so if you can , try to look at other loans that are not included in these so that you can be sure that you are comparing all your options .
It is also a good idea to look at different types of loans .
You will find that there are different options that you can take when you are looking to borrow the money .
This means that it is worth making sure that you do not eliminate those options .
You will then be able to check whether a personal loan is a good idea compared with other loan types that might be cheaper .
Of course , there are more differences between loan types than just the cost and you will need to look and see which you think will give you the best value for money .
If you have n’t already jumped on the mobile marketing train , then it ’s about time you do .
You ’ll want to make the jump as soon as possible as well , because it ’s moving quickly , and you do n’t want to be left in the dust .
More than 50 % of people on the internet are using their phones to access it , which means you need to use mobile marketing .
If you do n’t have a mobile marketing strategy in place for your small business , then how many consumers are you losing business to ?
It ’s a fact that more people are turning to their smartphones for internet use than ever before .
Whether you ’ve recently started a small business or are looking for new ways to advertise , mobile marketing needs to be on the top of your priority list .
Do n’t miss the mobile marketing train and get lost in the dust .
It ’s time to make the jump right now .
Continue reading below for a list of 7 reasons why you ’re going to want a first - class ticket to the mobile marketing express !
1 . It ’s a Direct Way to Reach Consumers
When you use other forms of advertising , there ’s a risk of the advertisement never making it into the right hands .
Maybe your mail flyer was quickly thrown in the trash before it was ever looked at .
Maybe your bulletin board posts were passed up by consumers who matter most ( your target audience ) .
When you create a mobile marketing strategy , you ’re directly reaching your consumer and target audience without error .
Many people have their phones on them throughout the entire day if not directly in their hands .
For most , their smartphone is the last thing they look at at night and the first thing they see in the morning .
Connecting to your consumers via their smartphone is an ideal way of reaching to them directly .
2. Online Shopping Is Common
Online shopping has also become more popular .
Think about how often you , yourself , use your mobile device to complete shopping orders rather than go to the store and shop in - person .
Stores have made it even easier for customers by allowing them to shop online and then pick up their orders for free ( no delivery charge ) with a drive - up pick - up .
There are even apps that allow you to create a shopping list and then have someone else go to the physical store and purchase the items for you .
Because online shopping is more common , you need to create a mobile marketing strategy that allows your consumers to browse through your products or services online and make purchases or schedule appointments via their mobile devices .
When a purchase is made , you can then send out shipments using automatic printing and seamless integration .
These features are essential to have to make the process as simple as possible .
3 . It Reaches Consumers While in the Stores
Depending on what your business is , you might want to reach your target audience while they ’re inside the actual store .
Different mobile apps allow consumers to search for coupons , track down deals , and make price comparisons all while shopping at the store .
Apps like these make for a wonderful mobile marketing strategy .
If you have a storefront , be sure to look into creating a mobile app that improves the consumer ’s shopping experience in one way or another .
Even if your business does n’t sell products , but instead offers services , you can still use an app to improve the consumer ’s experience with your business .
4. It Targets a Larger Audience
When you use more traditional methods of marketing , you ’re only able to reach a small number of people .
For example , if you hang up flyers , you ’re only going to advertise to the small number of people who happen to walk past your flyer and stop to read it .
When you use mobile marketing techniques , you ’re able to target a much larger audience .
Anyone with a smartphone will have access to your advertisements , which is a much larger number than those who ’ll walk by a flyer in a specific location .
5 . It Targets Consumers in Your Area
When you use mobile marketing to post advertisements , you can target consumers in your area .
For example , if you want to use Facebook Ads , you ’ll put in your location .
When someone on Facebook is in your area , whether they ’re visiting or live there , they ’ll see your ads .
This is also true when using Google Ads .
When someone is near your business and searches for a product you sell or a service you offer , they ’ll be met with an ad for your business .
6 . It ’s Done on a Variety of Platforms
Mobile marketing comes in a variety of forms .
There are several different platforms that you can use to reach mobile users .
This is another reason why mobile marketing is so important .
You have the option of using social media advertisements , email lists and newsletters , Google ads , in - game ads , SMS marketing , and more !
The best way to ensure you ’re reaching a wider audience is to use all forms of mobile marketing .
Know who your target audience is , and then use each type of platform to ensure you ’re reaching them .
7 . It ’s a Trusted Form of Advertising
Consumers trust marketing and advertising when it ’s sent to their mobile phones .
Why ?
Because traditional methods of marketing are becoming outdated , mobile marketing is the best way to keep up with the times .
A reputable business will do what it can to implement the newest forms of marketing .
When using something like an SMS sign up , consumers will know exactly who the advertisement is for and will trust it .
It ’s Time Small Businesses Begin to Use Mobile Marketing !
If you ’re a small business owner , then it ’s time to jump on the mobile marketing express and use mobile marketing to reach your audience and increase sales !
Do n’t fall behind , because one of the most important things about owning a business is learning to be flexible and incorporate new trends .

Farah 's parents left Iraq after her father was attacked on his way home A storm was brewing and there was a roll of thunder .
Farah - a four - year - old Iraqi girl now living in Lexington , Kentucky - urgently asked her mother , " Was that a bomb ? "
Farah and her brother Bashar - who is nearly two - used to live in Baghdad with their parents Haithem and Ethar .
Ethar worked in a bank , Haithem as an interpreter - for the Iraqi army , and for American forces at a base near the capital .
One evening , Haithem was driving home with his friend when they were pursued by two cars with men shooting at them .
Haithem 's friend , in the passenger seat , was shot dead .
Haithem arrived home that night with his friend 's blood all over his T - shirt .
Haithem and Ethar decided to leave .
Adjustments Ethar has a British passport ( she was born in London ) , and so have the children .
But Haithem has an Iraqi passport .
The British authorities refused to let them settle in the UK as a family .
Farah in Baghdad - a city of guns , checkpoints , death threats and fear They applied to live in the US .
It took two years , but they now have their " green cards " , which means they are permanent residents with the right to work .
They are finding it hard to adjust .
The US is land of cars and credit cards .
They have no car , and no credit cards .
And they have found it deeply unsettling moving from a country where there is immense community support to a place where they are expected to fend entirely for themselves .
They arrived to a completely empty flat in Lexington .
No beds , no seating , no kitchen equipment .
Nothing .
A friend lent them blankets , and they slept on the carpeted floor .
Church help Haithem imagined he would get support from the local mosque in Lexington .
They never returned his calls .
Haithem thinks he has only one realistic but appalling alternative - to go back to Baghdad
The family have now moved to a two - bedroom apartment , which is fully furnished and decorated with gifts from the local ecumenical church .
They have even provided toys and crayons and colouring books for the two children .
And they 've been accepted by a local programme for refugees - which is paying their first three months ' rent .
Haithem and Ethar are mystified that the US Embassy in Baghdad gave them their documents , and said , " You 're good to go " , but made no provision for the complexities of arriving in the US .
Nightmares Finding appropriate work is proving hard too .
Ethar wants to stay at home to look after the children until they have learned English , so Haithem has to get a job .
And $ 6 an hour at a burger bar is n't enough for the $ 600 a month rent for their apartment , which they will soon have to start paying .
So he thinks he has only one realistic but appalling alternative - to go back to Baghdad as a well - paid interpreter for a firm of US contractors .
His application is being processed .
In Baghdad , Ethar used to have nightmares in which a man with a beard - looking like Osama Bin Laden - was trying to kill her husband .
In Lexington she sleeps well , with no bad dreams .
But they are likely to return if Haithem goes back to the city of guns and checkpoints and razor wire and death threats and bombs .

WASHINGTON  Registered lobbyists have donated large amounts of money to Senator John McCain ’s presidential campaign , even as he denounces their profession .
But Democratic candidates for Congress have also raised prodigious sums from lobbyists , outdoing the Republicans , according to reports filed for the first time under a new ethics law .
Senator Barack Obama , the presumptive Democratic nominee for president , says he does not want money from lobbyists , but a few modest contributions have slipped through .
Health care , education , environmental and human rights lobbyists have given to Mr. Obama .
In total , lobbyists and trade groups have reported giving about $ 10.4 million to presidential and Congressional candidates in the first half of this year .
So far , Mr. McCain , who has locked up the Republican presidential nomination , has received more than $ 181,600 from lobbyists and trade groups , while Mr. Obama has received just over $ 6,000 .
Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton , who ended her bid for the presidency in June , got more than $ 87,000 .

Just hours after taking delivery of his brand new electric supercar , the unnamed owner of Tesla # 6 has found himself back at the
Menlo Park dealership awaiting news from his insurance company .
Dane
Golden reports that his friend Alex Volkov stumbled upon the first crash of a privately owned Tesla .
At 6 PM on Friday afternoon , the Jet Black beauty found itself unceremoniously wedged in front of an early ‘ 90s Camry and beneath a
2000s C-Class at the corner of Geary Boulevard and Gough Street in San
Francisco .
Volkov , who came upon the carbon fiber carbon - friendly wreck ten minutes after it occurred , told Wired.com that the crash scene was sedate with only one police car blocking traffic .
“ No action , no drama – everyone was very mellow , ” Volkov said .
“ Nobody was blaming anybody .
The people involved in the crash were just giving their testimony for police officers . ”
Volkov and bloggers speculated that the car was being driven by a Tesla engineer since it had no license plates .
However , Darryl Siry , Tesla ’s Vice President of
Marketing , told Wired.com that # 6 ( shown here in happier times ) had been delivered to a customer ’s home shortly before the accident .
“ It was a Tesla customer who got into that accident .
We 're aware of it because we service our vehicles , ” he said , though he declined to name the customer ( who he did identify as male ) so as to protect his identity .
Autopia is working on obtaining an official copy of the police report from the San Francisco Police Department .
Until then , we ’ll bring you some good old - fashioned he - said , she - said and post - crash photos .
According to Volkov , eyewitnesses to the crash told him the Roadster had gone “ unnoticed ” because of its low profile and silent powertrain .
“ There was extensive recording , switching between police officers to compare notes – writing , writing , writing , more than I 've seen in an average accident , especially because they could n't believe the statements .
They were trying to establish the fact of the car 's unnoticeability . ”
Though he arrived well after the crash , Volkov speculated the accident was the fault of the Tesla ’s driver because eyewitnesses told him the
Tesla ’s driver was trying to “ go bumper to bumper between the cars , ” a theory supported by the damage to the Tesla ’s right front and rear corners .
The car “ probably would still be ok if the first one did n't suddenly stop in rush hour traffic , ”
which Volkov estimated was moving between 25 and 30 miles per hour .
Volkov did not speak with any of the drivers involved .
Siry said that the customer was rear - ended , a theory that makes sense considering the angle of the crash and that the airbags did n’t deploy .
“ He did n't crash into someone , ” he said .
“ The rear - ending caused him to go under the car in front of him – my guess is that 's why the airbags did n't deploy . ”
Right now the car is at the dealership with a positive prognosis .
“ We have the car now .
I think it 's repairable , ” Siry said .
“ I
have n't seen it personally , let 's wait until the insurance company takes a look at it . ”
He doubted it would be totaled because so much of the car ’s value lies in its batteries .
“ It ’s a very unique car , it 's sad that it happened , ” he said .
This is the fourth Tesla to be damaged .
The first two were crash tests sacrificed in the name of federal crashworthiness certification , while former Tesla CEO Mark Eberhard ’s car was damaged by a technician during delivery .
According to Siry , between 8 and 10 of the
$ 109,000 electric cars have been delivered .
Let ’s hope none of them meet the same fate as this one .

Even with the human genome in hand , geneticists are split about how to deal with issues of race , genetics and medicine .
Some favor using genetic markers to sort humans into groups based on ancestral origin – groups that may show meaningful health differences .
Others argue that genetic variations across the human species are too gradual to support such divisions and that any categorisation based on genetic differences is arbitrary .
These issues have been discussed in depth by a multidisciplinary group – ranging from geneticists and psychologists to historians and philosophers – led by Sandra Soo -Jin Lee of Stanford University , California .
Now the group has released a set of 10 guiding principles for the scientific community , published as an open letter in this week ’s Genome Biology .
Advertisement
1 . All races are created equal
No genetic data has ever shown that one group of people is inherently superior to another .
Equality is a moral value central to the idea of human rights ; discrimination against any group should never be tolerated .
2 . An Argentinian and an Australian are more likely to have differences in their DNA than two Argentinians
Groups of human beings have moved around throughout history .
Those that share the same culture , language or location tend to have different genetic variations than other groups .
This is becoming less true , though , as populations mix .
3 . A person ’s history is n’t written only in his or her genes
Everyone ’s genetic material carries a useful , though incomplete , map of his or her ancestors ’ travels .
Studies looking for health disparities between individuals should n’t rely solely on this identity .
They should also consider a person ’s cultural background .
4 : Members of the same race may have different underlying genetics
Social definitions of what it means to be “ Hispanic ” or “ black ” have changed over time .
People who claim the same race may actually have very different genetic histories .
5 . Both nature and nurture play important parts in our behaviors and abilities
Trying to use genetic differences between groups to show differences in intelligence , violent behaviors or the ability to throw a ball is an oversimplification of much more complicated interactions between genetics and environment .
6 . Researchers should be careful about using racial groups when designing experiments
When scientists decide to divide their subjects into groups based on ethnicity , they need to be clear about why and how these divisions are made to avoid contributing to stereotypes .
7 . Medicine should focus on the individual , not the race
Although some diseases are connected to genetic markers , these markers tend to be found in many different racial groups .
Overemphasising genetics may promote racist views or focus attention on a group when it should be on the individual .
8 . The study of genetics requires cooperation between experts in many different fields
Human disease is the product of a mishmash of factors : genetic , cultural , economic and behavioral .
Interdisciplinary efforts that involve the social sciences are more likely to be successful .
9 . Oversimplified science feeds popular misconceptions
Policy makers should be careful about simplifying and politicising scientific data .
When presenting science to the public , the media should address the limitations of race - related research .
10 . Genetics 101 should include a history of racism
Any high school or college student learning about genetics should also learn about misguided attempts in the past to use science to justify racism .
New textbooks should be developed for this purpose .
The Stanford group did n’t always agree when coming up with these ideas .
Predictably enough , the biomedical scientists tended to think of race in neutral , clinical terms ; the social scientists and scholars of the humanities argued that concepts of race cannot be washed clean of their cultural and historical legacies .
But both groups , according to the letter , recognise the power of the gene in the public imagination and the historical dangers of its misrepresentation as deterministic and immutable .

Genetics – Keep up with the pace in our continually updated special report .
Irreversible Climate Change Policy By Arnold Kling
Megan McArdle writes ,
Ryan
Avent has been doing some great posting on cap and trade versus carbon taxes .
With all information known , the two are theoretically identical .
But in the real world they will differ ; the question is how much .
One way to think about it is that we are choosing between two kinds of transparency : transparency to regulated companies , and transparency to voters .
Politicians like cap and trade because the connection between the plan and higher energy prices will be less obvious to the voters .
For that reason , a libertarian should generally prefer a direct tax .
I will discuss the theoretical equivalence of a carbon tax and cap - and - trade below the fold .
In practice , cap - and - trade creates an irresistable opportunity for politicians to use carbon permits as political favors to be handed out to special interests .
This in turn means that there will be special interests with a large stake in keeping cap - and - trade policies in place , regardless of what transpires in terms of global temperature .
What is the probability that the United Nations derivation of climate model consensus overstates the problem of man-made global warming ?
Unless that probability is zero , it seems to me that we should prefer a climate change policy that is reversible to one that it irreversible .
Because I think that the probability that the UN is misleading us is significantly greater than zero , I think that the issue of irreversibility is quite important .
Therefore , I think that a carbon tax is far preferable to cap - and - trade .
Ten years from now the global warming scare might be completely debunked , and yet we will still be unable to unwind cap - and - trade .
As with farm subsidies and many other policies , the problem will be long gone but the solution will be with us in perpetuity .
In theory , cap - and - trade can be equivalent to a tax .
Suppose that your goal is to reduce carbon emissions by 50 percent .
You estimate the responsiveness of carbon usage to price , and you raise the tax or taxes on carbon - using activities by the amount that you think will get a response of 50 percent .
If you start seeing responses that are different from what you expected , you adjust the tax rate up or down , as necessary .
The result is that people substitute away from carbon - intensive production methods and consumption , and government gets revenue from the tax .
With cap - and - trade , you issue a set of permits to be bought by firms that sell carbon - intensive goods or use carbon - intensive production methods .
However , you only issue enough permits to allow for 50 percent of today ’s carbon use .
You auction off these permits , and these permits then can be traded between firms as they get a clearer idea of where substitution away from carbon is easy or difficult .
This trading takes place in a market , resulting in a market price .
The price or carbon permits raises the cost of carbon - intensive consumption and production relative to other forms of consumption and production , causing people to substitute away , exactly as if it were taxed .
Assuming that government auctions off the permits , then government gets revenue from the cap - and - trade system , exactly as with a tax .
In theory , you can make cap - and - trade equivalent to a tax .
What I worry about is that under cap - and - trade Congress is very unlikely to have a pure auction of permits .
Instead , permits will be given to favored industries .
The equivalent under a carbon tax would be to set different tax rates for different industries , with favored industries getting anywhere from a partial exemption to a full exemption to a negative carbon tax , or a carbon subsidy .
I think that this would be a complex set of tax rates for Congress to manage , both computationally and politically .
Therefore , my guess is that using the tax approach there would be less micro-management , and Congress would create fewer clear winners with a stake in perpetuating the policy .
Finally , there is the famous Weitzman paper on “ prices vs. quantities . ”
He points out that if the welfare - maximizing government is uncertain about some of the parameters in the system , then setting a price ( via a tax ) is not equivalent to setting a quantity ( via a cap ) .
Students of economics should take time to appreciate the argument , but I think in this case it is less important than the political economy of cap - and - trade .
I get the sense that Tyler Cowen , in his comment on this issue , is perhaps indirectly alluding to Weitzman .

“ Most of those states have n’t voted Democratic in a presidential since the Johnson landslide over Goldwater in 1964 , and we do n’t see that changing , ” said Harold Ickes , a senior adviser to Mrs. Clinton .
“ They ’re great states , but Idaho , Nebraska and the Carolinas are not going to be in the Democratic column in November .
He ’s winning the Democratic process , but that is virtually irrelevant to the general election . ”
Look deeper , the Obama campaign contends , and there is another argument in his favor in traditionally non-Democratic states :
He has drawn more votes from independents and Republicans than Mrs. Clinton has .
But it is unclear whether independents and some Republicans in swing states or Republican - leaning states would choose him over Senator John McCain of Arizona , the presumptive Republican nominee .
At the same time , Mr. Obama has argued that Mrs. Clinton ’s victories in closely contested states like Arizona , Nevada and Ohio were no slight against him .
Yet he has not shown that he can win as much support from blue - collar workers and Hispanics as she has .
In conversations with superdelegates , Obama advisers have cast Mrs. Clinton as a divisive figure who would struggle to win swing states and be a drag on other Democratic candidates .
That argument has yet to be proved at the ballot box , though some political analysts and state officials say that they believe Mrs. Clinton could wound the ticket in some states , because polls have shown her to be a polarizing figure .
“ Some state polls that I ’ve seen show Obama doing much better against McCain than Hillary ; that ’s a legitimate cause for concern for state officials who are superdelegates , ” said Steve Murphy , a Democratic strategist who is not working for either candidate .
“ In the last few cycles , the Democratic vote for the House of Representatives has aligned closely with the percentage of the vote we received in the presidential race . ”
Mrs. Clinton points to her victories in the Texas primary and in Arkansas and Tennessee as a sign that she has appeal in states that Democrats struggle to carry in a general election .
What is more , Clinton advisers question whether Mr. Obama has a real base of support in the swing states Mrs. Clinton won , arguing that he has relied on upper - income liberals , college - educated voters and students , groups that , the Clinton team argues , will support any Democratic nominee .
That said , many of these voters have appeared far more passionate about Mr. Obama than Mrs. Clinton .

Texas will go ahead with the scheduled Aug. 5 execution of Houston rapist - killer Jose Medellin despite Wednesday 's United Nations world court order for a stay , a spokesman for Gov. Rick Perry said .
The U.N. 's International Court of Justice 's call for stays in the cases of Medellin and four other Mexican nationals awaiting execution in Texas came in response to a petition filed last month by the Mexican government .
The petition sought to halt executions to allow for review of the killers ' cases to determine whether denying them access to the Mexican Consulate after arrest impaired their trial defenses .
The Vienna Convention on Consular Relations stipulates that , upon request , an alien offender 's national consulate must be notified of his arrest .
In its order , the world court quotes the Mexican government 's argument that " Texas has made clear that unless restrained , it will go forward with the execution without providing Mr. Medellin the mandated review and reconsideration , " which will " irreparably " breach the U.S. government 's obligations to the court 's 2004 order .
The Mexican government reasons that " the paramount interest in human life is at stake , " according to the court 's order .
If Medellin and the other nationals are executed without additional court reviews , " Mexico would forever be deprived of the opportunity to vindicate its rights and those of the nationals concerned . "
Perry 's office dismissed the argument .
" The world court has no standing in Texas and Texas is not bound by a ruling or edict from a foreign court , " Perry spokesman Robert Black said .
" It is easy to get caught up in discussions of international law and justice and treaties .
It 's very important to remember that these individuals are on death row for killing our citizens . "
But international law expert Sarah Cleveland , a professor of human and constitutional rights at New York City 's Columbia Law School , said if the U.S. fails to act on the world court order , other countries may follow suit .
" This can only come back to hurt U.S. citizens when they are detained abroad , " she wrote in an e-mail . " ...
When a global leader like the U.S. refuses to comply with its clear international legal obligations ( and everyone agrees that this is a clear legal obligation ) , it undermines the willingness of other states to comply with their own obligations and it inspires them not to trust us to obey ours . "
Deadly gang initiation
Medellin , 33 , was condemned for the 1993 killings of Jennifer Ertman , 14 , and Elizabeth Peña , 16 , who stumbled into a drunken midnight gang initiation rite at T.C. Jester Park in northwest Houston .
One of Medellin 's accomplices , Derrick O'Brien , was executed in July 2006 .
Also sentenced to die is gang leader Peter Anthony Cantu .
Three other accomplices are serving prison sentences .
Medellin was the only non-American involved in the murders .
Wednesday's U.N. court decision in The Hague , Netherlands , was the latest development in an ongoing legal wrangle that has involved President Bush , the U.S. Supreme Court and the Mexican government .
In 2004 , the U.N. court ordered a review of the cases of 51 Mexican nationals facing execution in the United States because they had not been allowed to speak with their nation 's consular officials .
In February 2005 , Bush directed state courts to abide by the U.N. court decision , specifically asking Texas to review Medellin 's case .
In March , the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that Bush had overstepped his authority .
Chief Justice John Roberts said the president cannot order such court reviews without congressional concurrence .
On Monday , U.S. Rep. Howard Berman , D - Calif. , filed a bill providing for such reviews .
As of Wednesday , it was in committee .
Weeks after the Supreme Court 's ruling , Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice and U.S. Attorney General Michael Mukasey jointly wrote Perry asking for his help in obtaining the reviews .
The United States , they wrote , continues to be bound by the world court 's decision under international law .
Girls ' fathers adamant
Meanwhile , Randy Ertman , father of Jennifer Ertman , hotly denounced the world court 's order for stays .
" The world court do n't mean diddly , " he said .
" This business belongs in the state of Texas .
The people of the state of Texas support the execution .
We thank them .
The rest of them can go to hell . "
Adolfo Peña , father of Elizabeth Peña , agreed .
" I believe we 've been through all the red tape we can go through , " he said .
" It 's time to rock and roll . "

The presidency ages a man .
( And hypothetically it would a woman , but we 'll never know ! )
Remember when there was color in Bill Clinton 's and George W. Bush 's hair ?
Barely ?
After two terms in the Oval Office , both men looked twenty years older .
This despite the fact that Bush gets 12 hours of sleep a night and Clinton received regular tail !
But what will happen to Barack Obama or John McCain ?
Obama does too many drugs to sleep and old people like McCain just doze off in front of the tv each night for a couple unsatisfying hours .
So we had intern Anna Peele work a little photoshop wizardry to age Obama and McCain and help us figure out exactly which terrifying visage we 'll be forced to look upon in 2012 .
Scary results below !
See ?
Then they 'll dissolve the Senate and create the Galactic Empire .
The mysterious circle of stones that rises on Salisbury Plain near here has stood as an archaeological marvel for thousands of years , its origins and purpose shrouded in the mists of history .
But a just - completed excavation of Stonehenge , the first within the ancient circle in more than 40 years , could provide some of the first reliable explanations for one of the greatest wonders of the prehistoric world .
A team of British archaeologists hopes to prove its theory that nearly 4,000 years ago Stonehenge was regarded not as a place of sacrament for the dead , but as a temple with healing powers .
The dig is looking closely at the 82 bluestones -- a double circle of large rocks , some weighing as much as 4 tons , that were brought in during the second stage of Stonehenge , the first stone construction at the site that began about 2150 BC .
Advertisement
About 150 years later , these were rearranged and encircled by much larger sarsen stones that have become iconic of Stonehenge .
Yet it is the bluestones , somehow hauled to the Salisbury Plain from the Preseli Hills in Pembrokeshire , Wales , that researchers say hold the key to the mystery .
Although the researchers found to their dismay that the area they examined had been tampered with in Roman times , they still hope the excavations will help show that the bluestones were once viewed as having therapeutic powers .
Stonehenge ’s legends have been many .
Some have said the devil bought the stones from a woman in Ireland ; another story suggests they were placed on the plain by the fabled wizard Merlin ; others have claimed that aliens built the monument and left it as a place for worship , or that Druids built it as a temple for sacrificial ceremonies .
Advertisement
“ You could put 10 archaeologists in a room and you ’d get at least 11 theories , ” said Dr. Andrew Fitzpatrick of Wessex Archaeology , a firm involved in the excavation , which was approved by English Heritage , which manages Stonehenge .
“ I think the one thing everybody would agree on is that Stonehenge is a temple , which is easy to lose sight of in the kind of to - ing and fro-ing of ideas . ”
But the recent realization that the site contained stones from mountains 250 miles away in Wales shed new light on Stonehenge ’s origins .
Tim Darvill , a professor at the University of Bournemouth , and Geoff Wainwright , president of the Society of Antiquaries of London , have spent the last six years researching Stonehenge and the rocky outcrop Carn Menyn , thought to be the site in the Preseli Hills from which the bluestones were taken .

Darvill and Wainwright , the co-directors of the dig , found the Welsh site to be a center for ceremony and burials , where the springs that flowed below the rocks were regarded by ancients as having medicinal powers .
They hope that by finding evidence to tie the stones from the Preseli Hills to those at Stonehenge , they will have an answer to the age - old question of the site ’s purpose .
The two men hope to establish a more precise timeline , to within 10 years , for the construction of Stonehenge by using radiocarbon dating to compare samples from the excavation with those taken from the site in Wales .
The scientists also hope to shed light on whether the stones were transported manually , as Darvill believes , or the former Irish Sea Glacier pushed them to Salisbury .
But one fact is certain :
Their presence makes Stonehenge unique among the stone circles of its era .

“ Once they arrive here , this monument becomes very different from any other kind of monument in the British Isles . . . .
And when they come here they elevate this monument into something rather special , ” Darvill said one recent afternoon as a student volunteer sifted dirt through a large metal sieve .
“ You can make the analogy with a medieval cathedral -- it ’s a bog - standard Paris church until they get those relics , and at that point it becomes a beautiful , marvelous building , ” he said .
“ It changes its purpose at about that time from a fairly standard henge to a temple of really European renown . ”
This theory , first proposed by Darvill in a book , “ Stonehenge : The Biography of a Landscape , ” that he wrote nearly two years ago , is in its infancy when compared with the other beliefs and cult theories about the monument that have been floated for hundreds of years .
Even so , Fitzpatrick said , it is also one of the two most widely accepted current archaeological theories about the origins of Stonehenge .
The second dominant theory is being explored by Mike Parker Pearson of the University of Sheffield , who recently uncovered evidence of a village in Durrington Walls , another henge monument a few miles from Stonehenge .
Advertisement
Pearson believes that Stonehenge ’s true significance is in its relationship to a sister temple found at Durrington Walls .
He believes that the two temples served as centers for religious observance -- Durrington Walls as a site of feasts for the living , Stonehenge as a series of statues of the dead .
“ There is certainly a debate going on amongst archaeologists in the UK at the moment , ” Fitzpatrick said .
“ We ’re all kind of waiting to see how it pans out ; we ’re waiting to see if the new excavations provide dating , which will help us resolve some of these questions . ”
Now that researchers have come to believe the bluestones came from Wales , the question is why .
If prehistoric people believed they were ordinary rocks , surely they would not have labored to move them so far .
One clue may lie in the burial mounds that surround the site :
Are they commemorations of the dead or evidence of attempts to heal the living ?
Advertisement
“ There ’s people in the landscape buried here who have come here perhaps like pilgrims , in order to benefit from the things here , ” Darvill said .
“ You can imagine a big temple like this is going to have shamans , it ’s going to have witch doctors , it ’s going to have all the sorts of people who in prehistoric terms would look after those who were ill . ”
Many of the remains uncovered during previous excavations show signs of ailments and , in some cases , primitive surgery .
“ One , for example , has a trepanation taken out of the top of the skull , a circular piece of bone taken out to relieve pressure on the brain , ” Darvill said .
“ You ’ve got to be feeling pretty unwell to let somebody get a flint blade and cut the top of your head off . ”

Although the Romans may have destroyed some of the evidence that the two scientists were hoping to find , they refuse to be deterred .
Their research “ ties in with some big questions about the interpretation of Stonehenge , ” Darvill said .
“ Once these bluestones were moved here , people believed the place was important , it was sacred , they could become pilgrims , they could come here . ”
But for what ?
For Darvill and Wainwright , inching closer to an answer is all they can ask for .

Texas Congressman Ron Paul made a short appearance on the nationally syndicated Alex Jones show yesterday and elaborated on his recent warning of an imminent major event that could send liberty into hibernation .
Referring to his statement before the House last week in which he warned of “ chaos about to be unleashed ” on the economic and political system , the Congressman told listeners :
“ Most of the thoughts going through my mind concerned the relationship of foreign policy and how it ’s draining and bankrupting us and the critical problems that we have in the financial sector today . ”
“ I dwell on the dollar because hundreds of billions of dollars have been allotted to bail out the housing program , that puts weight on the dollar , and the dollar is going down so we can expect a lot of inflation and a weak economy and I think we ’re seeing the beginning of a major economic event . ”
Paul continued .
“ If you do n’t save the dollar , everybody is going to suffer a lot more than anyone ever dreamed of , I mean you can keep trying to prop up the system and reinflate the bubble , and try to care of everybody receiving welfare checks , but what happens when the money does n’t buy anything ? ”

The Congressman also warned of hidden items within the recent housing bill , which he has dubbed “ the mother of all bailouts “ :
“ Inside that bill they decided that they are going to start fingerprinting anybody who works within the mortgage business as a supposed solution to our problems .
Also in that bill they have a new law that says that every single credit card transaction will be reported to the IRS , and they raised the national debt by $ 800 million dollars . ”
Paul commented .
The Congressman also commented on his frightening experience earlier this week when a plane he was a passenger on suddenly depressurized and was forced to make an emergency landing in New Orleans .
In addition he revealed details of the rally he ’s hosting in Minneapolis in September to coincide with the RNC , which has now moved to a bigger venue and blossomed into a three - day Campaign for Liberty mini-convention .

How many times have you passed one of these annoying things and thrown 50 cents away ?
I 'm hugely guilty of it .
I can't resist them .
One time I got six out in a row , then I 've gone years with no success .
Is there a secret ?
Well , it seems there is .
And seeing as how I 've spent some time warning you away from a lot of fairground cons recently , I thought I 'd try and be positive about at least one of them .
I did a little research and found several places offering some basic advice .
I 'm not entirely sure how much of this is based on hardcore scientific proof , and how much is just observation , but I 'm willing to learn anything I can to beat the crane game system .
So , first here 's a little advice from all over the WWW :
Go for 3 - pronged claws .
They are supposedly a little kinder to you than 4 - pronged claws .
Do n't believe the hype about grease .
The claws are n't coated in it , but they are very shiny and polished .
Look carefully at the selection .
The machine stockers will try to tuck most toys tightly together .
Use a friend .
There are two POVs , and lining up your claw perfectly is easier with a guide at your side .
Timing is everything .
Spend most of your time controlling the claw , and the last few seconds to grab .
Most important .
BAIL after a couple of bucks .
Do n't spend $ 15 on a $ 5 stuffed toy .
All that is all well and good , but I knew most of it from the experience I 'd had over the years I spent in front of claw machines .
So I searched deeper , and found a show on G4 called Brainiac had done the hard research for me .
And the results ?
Well , check them out in this cool video below .
Next time you pass a claw machine , you may be armed with enough knowledge to beat it .
Good luck , claw hounds .

After a nearly six month - long trial , the jury in the Hans Reiser murder prosecution finally has the case .
If you ’ve been following David Kravets ’ gavel - to - gavel coverage in this space , you know the facts are complicated .
At heart , though , the case puts a battery of circumstantial evidence against the proposition that Hans Reiser , though kind of a jerk , is n’t a killer .
No body has been found .
Much of the circumstantial evidence comes in the form of Reiser ’s suspicious behavior following his wife ’s disappearance .
Reiser ’s so - called Geek Defense proposes that this was the result of his overly - logical mind , and his inattention to social cues .
Wired.com is , of course , produced by geeks , for geeks , and many of our readers have been paying close attention to the case .
So we ’d be remiss if we did n’t give our readers a chance to weigh in .
Obviously , no amount of reading can replace the experience of sitting in a jury box , hearing the testimony first hand , and shouldering the responsibility of determining guilt or innocence in a murder prosecution .
So nobody should mistake this poll as a predictor of what the jury will find , or a barometer of Reiser ’s guilt or innocence .
We ’re posing the same question the jury is asked : has the prosecution proven its case to the necessary legal standard .
That is , based on the evidence presented at trial , would you find Reiser guilty of killing his wife , beyond a reasonable doubt ?
First degree murder requires premeditation , in a killing that is intentional and deliberate .
Second degree murder means there was no premeditation proven .
Voluntary manslaughter is an unplanned killing in the " heat of passion " or a " sudden quarrel . "
You can review Kravets ’ nearly 100 posts from courtroom here , and read more about the jury ’s instructions and see a timeline of events here .
Update:4/28/2008 18:15:00
The jury has returned its verdict , and the poll is closed .

Dozens of residents are stranded in their homes on Sydney 's north shore after a bomb went off in their street early this morning and a second was found under a car .
Officers were called to Walker 's Drive in the Lane Cove North housing estate about 3:30 am ( AEST ) , when residents heard gunshots , followed by an exlosion .
When they arrived , police found a homemade bomb had blown up near a car on the street .
Sergeant Tony
Bear says the explosion caused minor damage but police found a second bomb under the car .
The bomb squad was called in and the device was removed .
Ambulance crews arrived and were on standby but have since left the scene .
Police have blocked off the street , preventing about 50 people from driving out of the estate .
Forensic officers are examining the area and interviewing residents .
Police are asking any witnesses to come forward .

In this week ’s episode , I rant about the movie going experience , the marketing surrounding it , and how ’s it ’s gone from distraction to infraction .
You can either listen to this post via podcast :
Or read it as a blog post :
I went to the movies to see the new blockbuster WANTED starring Angelina Jolie and Morgan Freeman during its opening weekend .
My review ?
A great summer action movie that played out as The Matrix meets Office Space .
Very slick .
Very enjoyable .
But NOT so enjoyable was the process leading up to the movie .
The pre-game , if you will , was unbearable .
Remember the claims that movie companies were placing subliminal messages ( Drink Coca Cola ) in their pre-movie intros ?
They were attempting to get you to buy something without you even knowing it .
You were forced to sit in the semi - dark theatre , chomping on popcorn , and actually ( gasp ! ) talking to the person you came with .
Cheesy music played in the background while you waited for the previews .
So it was a minor breakthrough when theatres came up with the idea to show you amusing , time - passing ‘ Movie Scramble ’ games .
The next step was an ad for the local pizza joint or tavern that looked like they simply scanned in the print ad that they ran in the phone book that year , and put it up on the big screen .
But all that has changed …
Now you ’re getting full - featured commercials and highly produced movie shorts pitching products for minutes on end .
And it does n’t stop with the theaters simply bringing in revenue from outside businesses .
They ’re in on the game as well , pitching the fact that you can watch a standup routine of a comedian I ’ve never heard of , movie - style .
This strikes me as a weird genre .
I can listen to stand - up on Sirius Radio or on podcasts and still get the jokes .
Or I can have the full experience with a boisterous crowd at one of a dozens standup shows in Manhattan .
But really ?
Paying money to go to a movie theater to watch a comedian perform on screen ?
Even the message to turn off your cell phones was an ad .
There ’s a giant 30 foot screen saying Shut Off Your Cell Phones .
Everyone is looking at the screen .
There is nowhere else to look .
We get it .
We ’re supposed to turn off our phones .
There ’s still going to be that one moron that forgets , but we understand .
So why is the message up there not for 5 or 10 seconds , but 30 seconds or more ?
Why of courseâ€ ¦ it ’s the glowing , pulsating AT&T logo at the bottom .
Really ?
That ’s where their money is best spent ?
Do you think anyone , anywhere is signing up for a specific cell phone carrier based on seeing their logo on a Shut Off Your Phone movie promo ?
How does that conversation go ?
Marketing exec # 1 says :
You know boss , we ’ve heard from people in the field .
Research shows buyers are really confused with our smart phones , they do n’t know the difference between the Moto Q , the Blackjack , the Palm Centro , the 4 Blackberry models , or the Treo .
We recommend allocating some marketing dollars to make up some collateral so people can easily read about the advantages of each model .
What do you think ?
Marketing exec # 2 says : No , I have a better idea .
We do n’t want to help people that are already in our store ready to buy and use our phones .
Instead , lets pick a random place like a movie theatre , and put up our logo on the screen that tells everyone to TURN OFF THEIR PHONES .
That would be a huge success .
Know what my suggestion is ?
Give that money back and cut the price of text messages on the iPhone .
A recent TechCrunch article that got popular on Digg computed that the cost of text messages under the new iPhone plan was $ 1,310 per megabyte .
OK , again , we get it .
You ’re subsidizing the cost of the iPhone .
But do you have to take ALL our money ?
I have a feeling that it does n’t cost you upwards of $ 20 a month in expenses for users to send a few hundred texts at 160 bytes of data .
Some people complain about the number of ‘ real ’ movie trailers that they show , but that ’s been well - documented , and most people enjoy those , so I ’ll give them a pass .
Ditto for paying $ 9 for a ginormous package of teeth - rotting gummi bears or bushel of popcorn and a 55 gallon drum of Pepsi .
It ’s been that way for years and the difference is , you have a choice .
You can choose not eat or very easily snag a 99 cent bag of Twizzlers at the convenience store across the street .
But the number of commercials was relentless , with some even being shown twice .
At times it was hard to distinguish between a commercial and a new trailer .
That ’s because it was a trailer .
As a commercial .
As opposed to the trailers that were trailers .
But to my surprise , the unwanted marketing experience transcended from the screen to the theater itself .
I heard a voice in the aisle behind me , and turned to see a representative from the theater .
She was making some kind of announcement , and I feared that we had lost air conditioning power .
Earlier while I was waiting in the lobby , they made an announcement that the 3 pm showing was still on , but that one particular theater in the building did not have air conditioning .
Kind of a problem on a 90 degree day .
This was confirmed to me as I witnessed 2 - 3 ladders crowded near the entrance , with only maintenance workers legs visible as their unseen torso disappeared into the ceiling , frantically trying to repair some hidden generator as the temps neared triple digits outside .
Or maybe they were just manequin legs giving us a false sense of work being done .
Either way , cool air – and cash — was escaping the building .
But no , the representative was n’t informing us of any problems in the theater .
Not content with making us sit through ads , they were now going to physically take our cash .
Along with a handicapped male in an electric wheelchair , they proceeded to slowly pace the aisles – Sunday church style – asking for cash donations to the Boys and Girls Club .
Of course this charity is a fine organization .
I am sure they do wonderful things .
My heart goes out to the individual in the wheelchair .
Please please , be generous and donate to the Boys and Girls Club .
But I prefer to donate to charities of my own accord .
As an athlete by nature , I freely give to friends and co-workers running or biking for a good cause .
Because people close to me have battled cancer , I ’m focusing more of my donations on organizations that are working on a cure .
But to solicit money from me simply because we were an easy mark – a captive audience that could not get away – seemed exploitive , both for the handicapped worker , and their targets .
I can tell you the audience was visibly awkward .
Another blogger once wrote ( apologies for not having the link to reference ) that the difference here was that we paid money for one thing ( to see a movie ) , and because we had , we were entitled to that and just that – a movie going experience .
We did n’t ask to see commercials before the film started .
We ca n’t get away .
Forget about timing it to come on right as the previews start .
On a Saturday in downtown Manhattan ?
That ’s fine if you bring your first row neck brace .
On TV , there is an understanding .
You watch free TV , the content is subsidized by commercials .
Conversely you can pay for HBO or Showtime and see no ads .
Surf your favorite website for free ?
You ’ll likely see some banner ads .
Pay for Sirius radio ?
Most stations have no advertising .
Yes , there was a time when audiences were concerned that corporations were subliminally selling their products .
There was a time when theatres were happy to distract you with word puzzles and trivia .
That time is long gone .
The theatres have crossed the line from distraction to all out infraction .
They know they have you .
And now you ca n’t miss it , and you ca n’t get away .
George Washington ’s Blog
June 5 , 2008
A couple of months ago , a financial analyst who sells derivatives told me that fears about a meltdown in the derivatives market were unfounded .
Yesterday , he told me – with a very worried look – " THE DERIVATIVES MARKET IS UNWINDING ! "
What does this mean ?
What are derivatives and why should you care if the market is unwinding ?
Well , it turns out that the reason that Bear Stearns was about to go belly - up before JP Morgan bought it is that it had held trillions of dollars in derivatives , which were about to go south .
( The reason that JP Morgan was so eager to buy Bear Stearns is that it was on the other side of these derivative contracts — if Bear Stearns had gone under , JP Morgan would have taken a huge hit .
But the way the derivative agreements were drafted , a purchase by JP Morgan canceled the derivative contracts , so that JP Morgan did n’t experience huge losses .
That is probably why the Fed was so eager to broker – and fund – the shotgun marriage .
JP Morgan is a much larger player , and if Bear ’s failure had caused the derivatives hit to JP Morgan , it probably would have rippled out to the whole financial system and potentially caused an instant depression ) .
In addition , the subprime prime loan crisis is intimately connected to the unwinding of the derivatives market .
Specifically , loans were repackaged into derivatives called collateralized debt obligations ( or " CDO ’s " ) and sold to both big and regional banks and investment companies worldwide .
The CDO ’s were highly - leveraged — many times the amount of the actual loans .
When the subprime loan crisis hit , the high leverage magnified the fallout , and huge sums of CDO derivatives became essentially worthless .
Do you remember when wealthy Orange County , California , went bankrupt in 1994 ?
Yup , that was because it had invested in bad derivatives .
And , according to a recent article by one of the world ’s top derivative insiders , the market for credit default swap ( " CDS " ) derivatives is also unraveling .
And reported just today , Lehman Brothers is now on the edge , due to exposure to derivatives .
Derivatives are the Elephant in the Living Room
The subprime mortgage crisis is bad , and is hurting many people , and slowing the economy .
High oil and food prices are bad , and are hurting many people , and bringing down the economy .
But — according to top insiders — derivatives are the elephant in the room . . . the single largest threat to the U.S. and world economy .
One reason is that , according to Paul Volcker , the former chairman of the Federal Reserve , the entire modern financial system is based upon derivatives , and the financial system today is entirely different from the traditional American or global financial system because derivatives – a relatively new concept – now underly the entire fabric of the financial system .
In short , many of the people who know the most about derivatives say that the current system is a house of cards built upon derivatives .
Moreover , as mentioned above , the subprime and derivatives crises are closely linked .
Similarly , Britian ’s New Statesman newspaper links derivatives and rising food and commodity prices :
" This latest food emergency has developed in an incredibly short space of time – essentially over the past 18 months .
The reason for food " shortages " is speculation in commodity futures following the collapse of the financial derivatives markets .
Desperate for quick returns , dealers are taking trillions of dollars out of equities and mortgage bonds and ploughing them into food and raw materials .
It ’s called the " commodities super - cycle " on Wall Street , and it is likely to cause starvation on an epic scale .
The rocketing price of wheat , soybeans , sugar , coffee – you name it – is a direct result of debt defaults that have caused financial panic in the west and encouraged investors to seek " stores of value " .
These range from gold and oil at one end to corn , cocoa and cattle at the other ; speculators are even placing bets on water prices . "
Hiding the Ball
And yet banks and financial houses have hidden their derivatives exposure off the balance sheets .
No wonder almost no one understands derivatives :
Indeed , the government may have actively helped to hide the the derivatives mess since at least 2006 .
For example , according to Business Week :
" President George W. Bush has bestowed on his intelligence czar , John Negroponte , broad authority , in the name of national security , to excuse publicly traded companies from their usual accounting and securities - disclosure obligations . "
Former fed chairman Alan Greenspan has been a huge booster for and defender of derivatives since 1999 or before ( and see this ) .
Did you know that the same guy that pushed subprime loans has also aggressively pushed derivatives for many years ?
And the other regulatory agencies and Congress have taken a totally hands - off approach towards derivatives .
How Big a Problem ?
How big is the derivatives market ?
Worldwide , it is $ 596 TRILLION dollars *.
The derivatives market dwarfs the real market for goods and services , and acts likes an unregulated black market .
As one writer put it :
And its not just the U.S. Derivatives salesmen have sold these babies all over the world .
Because banks , financial institutions and governments world - wide have bought significant derivatives , the fall out will not be limited solely to the U.S.

The key to good health is to be physically active .
The key to being active is … to be born that way ?
The well - documented importance of exercise in maintaining fitness has created the idea that individuals can manage their health by increasing their activity .
But what if the inclination to engage in physical activity is itself significantly affected by factors that are predetermined ?
Two new studies suggest that the inclination to exercise may be strongly affected by genetics .
Controlled experiments into the effects of genetics on human activity have yet to be attempted , but recent studies on mice – the standard test species for mammalian genetics – have found genetic influences .
In a paper recently published in the journal Physiological Genomics , a team of researchers led by University of North Carolina at Charlotte kinesiologist J. Timothy Lightfoot announced that they had found six specific chromosomal locations that significantly correlate to the inheritance of a trait of high physical activity in mice , indicating that at least six genetic locations were affecting activity .
Now , in a study forthcoming in The Journal of Heredity , the same team has identified 17 other genetic locations that also appear to control the level of physical activity in mice through interaction with each other , a genetic effect known as epistasis .
Together , the located genes account for approximately 84 % of the behavioral differences between mice that exhibit low activity levels and mice that show high activity traits .
" Can you be born a couch potato ?
In exercise physiology , we did n't used to think so , but now I would say most definitely you can , " said Lightfoot .
The question of whether genetic influences can significantly affect activity in humans has never been rigorously studied , Lightfoot notes , but experiments with mice are indicating that the effect can be strong .
" The problem with the human literature in activity is that , up until recently , research has ignored the possibility that activity is regulated by biological as much as by environmental factors .
What 's interesting is that there is a disconnect between the animal and the human literature in this – researchers have n't been paying attention to the animal studies which , for example , have shown that that hormones affect activity . "
Lightfoot 's interest in the issue drew him to work with strains of mice that had markedly different behaviors when given an exercise wheel .
A " high - active " strain scored notably higher than other strains in speed , duration and distance achieved in running than other strains , including one that was labeled as " aggressively sedentary " because of its consistent avoidance of activity .
At first , Lightfoot suspected that the difference was due to genetic factors affecting the way energy is used by muscle tissue because early genetic studies of the strains indicated that variation was present in genes known to affect metabolism .
However , studies the team conducted on muscle tissue in the different mice failed to show a genetic effect that could cause a difference in muscle performance .
" We have done some gene chips on muscle tissue and we do n't see any differential expression between high - active and low - active animals in peripheral ( muscle ) tissue , " Lightfoot said .
" So the suggestion that by over - expressing a glucose transporter we can increase activity does n't seem to be the explanatory factor . "
Subsequent studies have led the team to suspect that genetic differences are having a profound affect on mouse activity levels by causing significant differences in their brains .
" More and more what we are seeing is differences in brain chemistry .
We are really convinced now that the difference is in the brain , " Lightfoot said .
" There is a drive to be more active . "
The current studies interbred active and inactive strains of mice to re-sort the genes .
The researchers tested the second generation ( f2 ) of offspring for activity using three measurements -- speed , endurance and distance – and found a range of significant differences among the new hybrid mice in their overall activity levels .
The team then performed genetic tests on the mice and found significant correlations between differences in their genomes and the behavioral variations .
The team identified six locations on the mouse chromosome where differences had a strong relationship to activity , indicating at least six genes that individually can affect activity .
A second genetic study found seventeen other genetic locations that were also having an effect on activity levels by interacting with each other .
While differences in activity could not be exclusively connected to genetics , a surprisingly large amount of the activity difference in the hybrids – about half – had a strong relationship to the specific genetic variations identified .
" We do n't know yet what the genes involved in activity are doing , but there is some strong suggestion that many of them may be involved in regulating dopamine , " Lightfoot noted .
" In one sense it is very similar to a model for genetic influences on ADD . "

I found this story puzzling ...
From MarketWatch : S&P says energy spending has fallen to 1971 pace
[ A ] Standard & Poor 's report said Wednesday it expects Americans to spend the same portion of their household income on energy as they did the year the Ed Sullivan Show went off the air .
S&P Chief Economist David Wyss said the ratings agency expects an average U.S. household to spend 6.7 % of its income on energy this year - the same portion spent on average in 1971 , before the creation of the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries oil cartel .
In the early 1980s , in contrast , energy costs accounted for 7.9 % of U.S. household income .
Click on image for larger graph in new window .
However , back in 1981 , energy was a much larger part of the US economy , representing 14 percent of the gross domestic product , Wyss says .
Because energy was so crucial back then , the Federal Reserve pushed interest rates sharply higher to curtail inflation .
Today , energy represents 7 percent of GDP .
These numbers do n't make sense to me , so instead I looked at U.S. energy consumption as a percent of GDP .
The EIA provides this percentage from 1970 through 2005 ( most recent estimate ) .
The EIA estimate shows that energy consumption as a percent of GDP was 8.4 % in 2005 , slightly higher than the 8.0 % in 1971 .
However , in case no one noticed , energy prices have increased since 2005 .
In 2005 , petroleum prices were in the $ 50 per barrel range , now spot prices are over $ 140 per barrel .
In 2005 , the average well head price for natural gas prices spiked to over $ 7.00 per million Btu because of the hurricanes in the gulf , and then declined slightly in 2006 .
However wellhead prices have spiked again to over $ 10.00 per MMBtu Even coal prices , after years of comparatively minor price changes , have risen significantly in 2008 Using the EIA price data , and making a few assumptions ( no increase in energy consumption in 2008 , and an energy mix of 40 % petroleum , 23 % coal , 23 % natural gas , and 14 % nuclear and renewables ) , we can estimate that energy consumption as a percent of U.S. GDP will set a record in 2008 of over 14 % .
This estimate could be too high .
Prices might fall , and the energy mix in 2008 might change , but clearly energy as percent of GDP will be close to the record high this year .
This graph shows the EIA estimates of energy consumption as a percent of GDP ( blue ) , and my estimates for 2006 through 2008 ( red ) .
In 2006 , Wyss was quoted in The Christian Science Monitor : Oil spike : a surmountable challenge ?
In 2006 , Wyss apparently was using the most recent data ( energy consumption was 7.0 % and 6.9 % in 2000 and 2001 respectively - the data available in 2006 ) .
However , as this graph shows , energy consumption was probably already approaching 10 % of GDP in 2006 .

He has always dreamed of pursuing a career in computer hardware engineering .
“ I want to design my own chipset ” , he used to tell his Computer Science teacher in high school .
Now , as a junior enrolled at a reputable technical college , he finally has the chance to make his dream a reality .
Although he somewhat slacked his way through the two years of general education courses , he always knew he would have to be studious during his junior year when the core engineering classes started .
He wakes up every morning filled with excitement and positive intentions .
Studying is actually the first thing that crosses his mind .
“ I ’ve got to get that chapter read ” , he tells himself .
But first he needs to grab some Starbucks and a muffin .
“ Okay , now I ’m ready . ”
He sits down at his dorm room desk and cracks open the book “ Modern Computer Hardware Design ” .
The phone rings .
It ’s Jane , a good friend he met in his sophomore English class .
“ Lunch , today ?
Yeah , I could do that .
How ’s noon sound ?
Perfect .
See you then . ”
Before he sits back down to read he remembers that he skipped his workout yesterday .
“ A quick workout will only take 45 minutes and it will energize my mind and prepare me for a couple hours of diligent studying ” , he thinks to himself .
He puts on his sneakers , grabs his iPod and heads over to the campus gym .
When he returns from the gym , he takes a shower and is again ready to start reading .
Page one : “ Welcome to the exciting world of computer hardware design .
This book is divided into … ”
“ Ah , crap !
I forgot to email my mother those photos I promised her .
Heck , it will only take a second . ”
He quickly opens up his laptop and logs into Gmail .
Before he has time to send the email he gets an IM from an old high school buddy , Greg , who he has n’t spoken to in six months .
After a forty - five minute chat session , he fires the email off to his mother and returns to the book .
He glances up at the wall clock and realizes he only has about thirty minutes before he has to leave to meet Jane for lunch .
“ Jeez , it will be pointless to get into the groove of a focused study session for just thirty measly minutes ” , he thinks out loud .
He convinces himself that it would be in his best interest to save the reading for after lunch .
So logs into Facebook , replies to a few messages from his friends and then heads off to meet Jane .
Once he returns from lunch an hour and a half later , he feels exhausted .
The post - meal grogginess is kicking in hard .
“ All I need is another round of Starbucks and I ’ll be ready ” , he thinks to himself .
He heads out to grab it .
As he sits back down at his desk with his coffee he repeats the word “ focus ” over and over as a mantra to himself .
He cracks the book back open .
Page one : “ Welcome to the exciting world of computer hardware design .
This book is divided into … ”
But then …
His neighbor knocks on his door .
“ Turn on the Local 6 news channel .
The college apartment complex down the street is on fire ” , his neighbor says .
Again , he puts down the book and then clicks on the television .
This should only take a second …
Yeah … right …

This week , Americans were introduced to Wrong - Way McCain .
To be sure , it 's the same John McCain ( " McSame " ) who would continue the policies of George W. Bush that 80 % of Americans believe have put the country on the wrong track .
It 's also the same " Jukebox John " who has changed his tune 61 times on issues foreign and domestic , including a dizzying 10 times in two weeks back in June .
But as he showed repeatedly over the past several days , Wrong - Way McCain is also the Republican presidential nominee who simply can't keep his stories straight .
Whether the result of crass political opportunism , transparent deceit or just plain confusion , on at least 7 occasions this week alone , Wrong Way McCain could n't remember what he stood for , if anything at all .
Equal Pay .
As part of his ongoing ( and failing ) effort to reach out to women voters , McCain on Friday proclaimed :
" I ’m committed to making sure that there ’s equal pay for equal work .
That there is equal opportunity in every aspect of our society .
And that is my record and you can count on it . " ( video here )
Unfortunately , as with his bogus claims regarding Hurricane Katrina , McCain 's record shows just the reverse .
In April , Mr. Straight Talk not only skipped the vote on the Ledbetter Fair Pay Act , but announced he would have opposed the bill because it " opens us up to lawsuits for all kinds of problems . "
The solution for American women , McCain argued then , is n't to fight pay discrimination , but " education and training . "
Football Follies .
For years , John McCain has told the tale of duping his Vietnamese captors by giving them the names of the Green Bay Packers instead of other pilots in his squadron .
As recently as 2005 , McCain confirmed for CNN that the account in his memoir Faith of My Fathers and the A&E biopic based on it was accurate .
But on Friday , McCain offered a made - to - order biographical facelift for a Pittsburgh audience .
With Pennsylvania and its 21 electoral votes in play ( compared to just 10 in Wisconsin , home of the Packers ) , McCain 's story suddenly honored the hometown team .
As he told KDKA - TV ( video here ) :
" When I was first interrogated and really had to give some information because of the physical pressures that were on me , I named the starting lineup -- defensive line -- of the Pittsburgh Steelers as my squadron - mates ! "
For its part , the McCain campaign rejected suggestions of a Pittsburgh Pander , instead claiming the episode was an " honest mistake " and that " if bloggers want to make fun of John McCain because he forgot which team he used under torture , that is their right . "
Phil Gramm and America's " Mental Recession . "
Earlier in the week , McCain 's " Jobs for America " economy road show went off the rails when his chief adviser and UBS vice chairman Phil Gramm declared the economic downturn a " mental recession " and America a " nation of whiners . "
But while a defensive McCain insisted at a press conference Thursday , " I strongly disagree , " on two different occasions earlier this year McCain , too , deemed the recession " psychological . "
In June , McCain declared that his born - again support for offshore drilling would have a " psychological impact that I think is beneficial . "
And back in April , Sigmund McCain told Fox News host Neil Cavuto that his gas tax holiday placebo was just what the doctor ordered for Americans ' fragile psyches , if not their pocketbooks ( video here ) :
" I 'm very concerned about it , Neil .
And obviously the way it 's been going up is just terrible .
But I think psychologically - and a lot of our problems today , as you know , are psychological - the confidence , trust , the uncertainty about our economic future , ability to keep our own home .
This might give them a little psychological boost .
Let 's have some straight talk , it 's not a huge amount of money . "
On Thursday , McCain told reporters that Phil Gramm " does not speak for me - I speak for me . "
That same day , as the Washington Post reported , Phil Gramm was in New York , " where he was meeting with the Wall Street Journal Editorial Board on McCain 's economic policies . "
First Term Balanced Budget Pledge .
McCain 's economic woes this week extended to on - again , off - again , on - again promise to balance the federal budget by the end of his first term .
After first making the pledge in February to end the red ink by 2013 , by April McCain had backed off , claiming " economic conditions are reversed . "
That same month , his adviser Douglas Holtz - Eakin was targeting 2017 , while claiming , " I would like the next president not to talk about deficit reduction . "
Alas , on Monday , the commitment that " John McCain will balance the budget by the end of his first term " magically reappeared in his " Jobs for America " document , if not in the abridged statement signed by 300 economists .
Luckily ( or unluckily ) for McCain , no one believes his fuzzy math , anyway .
As the New York Times said Sunday of the self - proclaimed " foot soldier " in the Reagan Revolution , " there he goes again . "
Insurance Coverage for Contraception .
In much the same way McCain fudged his record on equal pay to hoodwink women voters , his surrogate - gone - wild Carly Fiorina on Monday tried to sell a bill of goods when it came to Mr. Straight Talk 's opposition to requiring insurance companies which cover Viagra to also pay for birth control .
When a reporter the next day asked his position on the issue , McCain bumbled and stumbled before ultimately claiming he did n't know what it was :
When McCain was asked for his position on the issue , he said - with a nervous laugh - " I certainly do not want to discuss that issue . "
The reporter pressed .
" But apparently you ’ve voted against - " " I do n’t know what I voted , " McCain said .
The reporter explained that McCain voted against a bill in 2003 that would have required health insurance companies to cover prescription birth control .
" Is that still your position ? " she persisted .
During the awkward exchange , with several lengthy pauses , McCain said he had no immediate knowledge of the vote .
" I 've cast thousands of votes in the Senate , " McCain said , then continued : " I will respond to - it's a , it 's a … "
( As it turns out , this was hardly McCain 's first bout of squeamishness - or amnesia - when it comes to the issues of contraception , abstinence and AIDS . )
Teaching Intelligent Design .
As Steve Benen noted last week , McCain 's discomfort and confusion regarding evolution and intelligent design is the stuff of legend .
" In 2005 , " Benen wrote , " McCain endorsed intelligent design creationism , a year later he said the opposite , and a few months after that , he was both for and against creationism at the same time . "
In an interview with the New York Times on Sunday , John McCain again punted on the issue :
Q : How do you feel about teaching evolution in schools ?
Mr. McCain : I think , first of all , it ’s up to the school boards .
That ’s why we have local control over education .
So my personal view is that children should be exposed to as much as they possibly can so that they can make their decisions and be the best informed .
But I really believe that school boards are elected in order to make a lot of those decisions , and I respect their decisions unless they are unconstitutional in some way or , you know .
Q : If you were on a school board , how would you vote ?
Mr. McCain : I do n’t know , Adam .
I ’d have to see the proposal , I ’d have to see where it lies in the curriculum , I ’d have to - I can ’t .
I ’m not running for school board .
Support from Veterans Groups .
No area hits closer to home for John McCain then his treatment of - and support from - veterans groups .
Having already received credit from President Bush for backing the new GI Bill he opposed , McCain this week mistakenly claimed he enjoyed the backing of all veterans ' organizations .
Confronted by a Vietnam veteran at a Denver town hall meeting Monday , McCain insisted ( video here ) :
" I ’ve received every award from every major veteran ’s organization in America .
I received every organization in America their awards ... The reason why I have a perfect voting record from organizations like the Veterans of Foreign Wars , the American Legion and all the other veterans service organizations is because of my support of them . "
Of course , as ThinkProgress detailed , McCain 's record is far from perfect and his support from unanimous among veterans ' organizations :
He received a grade of D from the Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America and a 20 percent vote rating from the Disabled Veterans of America ; Vietnam Veterans of America noted McCain had “ voted against us ” in 15 " key votes . "
As for the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars - with whom McCain claims to have a “ perfect voting record ” - both groups vigorously supported Sen.
Jim Webb ’s ( D - VA ) GI Bill that McCain tirelessly opposed .
And so it goes .
After a disastrous week in which he also called Social Security " an absolute disgrace " and joked about killing Iranians not by bombing them but by using cigarettes of mass destruction , Wrong - Way McCain does n't know whether he 's coming or going .
And yet some in the American media can still be trusted to conclude that a week which should have ended his presidential hopes was " won " by John McCain .
The three largest genetic schizophrenia studies to date have uncovered several ways in which changes to the genome may increase the risk of developing the condition .
The studies bring to light several common variations that increase the risk slightly , and rarer ones that raise it significantly , researchers say .
While previous studies have suggested several genes with roles in schizophrenia , small sample sizes gave these findings limited statistical significance .
Most recently , differences in copy number variations ( CNVs ) – chunks of genetic material that are either repeated or missing from the genome entirely – were identified between healthy and schizophrenic people .
But the study was too small to implicate specific CNVs in causing the disease .
Advertisement
Quantity matters
Now , in the biggest study of its kind , the International Schizophrenia Consortium has collected further evidence about the role of CNVs in the condition .
The researchers examined the genomes of 3391 schizophrenics and found that they had around 15 % more CNVs on average than the 3181 healthy controls .
This supports the idea that the sheer increase in CNVs alone could be a risk factor for schizophrenia .
Another study , led by David St Clair of the University of Aberdeen , UK , and deCODE genetics , Iceland , looked at 66 specific CNVs in 1400 schizophrenics and 33,000 healthy participants .
Missing regions
The team was able to identify several CNVs that are linked to a much higher risk of developing schizophrenia , but occur relatively rarely – in as few as one in 1000 schizophrenics .
They found three missing chromosome regions that raised the risk of developing schizophrenia by as much as 15 times .
Importantly , two of these regions were also highlighted in the ISC study above , making it likely that these regions are a real risk factor .
Using yet a different approach , Michael O’Donovan of Cardiff University , UK , and colleagues looked for variations of single “ letters ” ( SNPs ) of the genetic code that were significantly more common in people with schizophrenia , occurring in as many as one in 10 .
Common variant
In a study of more than 360,000 SNPs , they found three convincing associations in specific genes , one of which increases the risk by about 1 % .
The gene , called ZNF804A , may play a role in regulating the activity of other genes .
“ The variation in that gene makes for a very small increase in risk , but it ’s also very common , ” O’Donovan says .
“ Together , the new studies show that many of us carry some risk genes for schizophrenia , but the people that have the illness simply carry more of them . ”
“ This is a provocative and important set of findings , ” says Daniel Weinberger , at the National Institute of Mental Health in Bethesda , Maryland .
But he adds that the rarity of the genetic variations means that the findings account for less than half a percent of schizophrenia cases .
“ We do n’t know yet if these results will translate to the other 99.5 % of people with a schizophrenia diagnosis , ” he says .
“ We ’ll have to further interrogate these regions and see whether common variants within them predict the more common forms of the disorder . ”
No simple test
There are likely to be many more genetic variants that are associated with schizophrenia coming to light – maybe as many as thousands , says St Clair .
“ I would n’t have said that even a year ago , but that ’s the way it ’s looking . ”
That means that a simple genetic test is still a long way off .
But both St Clair and O’Donovan believe that identifying some of the genes in the pathway – and where they can be found – is already a big step forward .
Dan Rujescu , a lead author on the deCODE study , likens the situation to that of Alzheimer ’s disease .
“ The findings of the rare Alzheimer ’s mutations contributed hugely to the understanding of how Alzheimer ’s works , ” he says .
“ One of the hopes is that as more studies like these come out in the near future , we can also understand the physiology of schizophrenia . ”

6月11日に青少年ネット規制法が成立した。法案時点での詳しい解説については楠さんのITmediaの記事があるので、是非読んでみてください。
決定事項と懸念事項 楠さんの記事で必要十分なのだが、参議院内閣委員会の審議内容があまり広まっていないせいか*1、いくらか誤解が広まっているように見受けられる。だから、素案の段階でMIAUが懸念していた問題と成立した法律の差分について指摘しておきたい（以下の理解が誤っていたらすぐさま教えてくださいね）。 予定している話題 プレインストール努力義務 自作PC、Linux 、PSPは現状維持 iPod Touchは要対策
有害基準の問題 有害情報は定義でなく例示に 判断主体はあくまで民 間
閣僚会議と基本計画による規制強化の可能性 国の関与は薄まる 基本計画で有害情報基準を策定しないとの言質
附 則3条による3年後の見直し 3年後といわず、今秋がひとつの山場
まとめ 可能な限り骨抜きにした法律 油断は禁 物
有害情報は定義でなく例示に 素案の段階では、以下の6つの情報が青少年有害情報として定義されていた。
人の性交等の行為又は人の性器等の卑わいな描写その他の性欲を興奮させ又は刺激する内容の情報であって、青少年に対し性に関する価値観の形成に著しく悪影響を及ぼすもの
殺人、傷害、暴行、処刑等の場面の陰惨な描写その他の残虐な行為に関する内容の情報であって、青少年に対し著しく残虐性を助長するもの
犯罪若しくは刑罰法令に触れる行為、自殺又は売春の実行の唆し、犯罪の実行の請負、犯罪等の手段の具体的な描写その他の犯罪等に関する内容の情報であって、青少年に対し著しく犯罪等を誘発するもの
麻薬等の薬物の濫用、自傷行為その他の自らの心身の健康を害する行為に関する内容の情報であって、青少年に対し著しくこれらの行為を誘発するもの
特定の青少年に対するいじめに当たる情報であって、当該青少年に著しい心理的外傷を与えるおそれがあるもの
家出をし、又はしようとする青少年に向けられた情報であって、青少年の非行又は児童買春等の犯罪を著しく誘発するもの
そして、何が有害で何が無害なのかの基準を内閣府内に設置する独立行政委員会（「青少年健全育成推進委員会」）が決定するというシステムを想定していたわけである。
当初から、実際に個々のコンテンツについて有害性の適否を判断し、違法有害コンテンツを見えなくさせるような措置を講ずるのは民間の事業者であって、行政の手によるものではなかった。しかし、それでも多くの個人や組織は「表現の自由」侵害の恐れを懸念し、反対声明を発表した。
その甲斐あってか、成立した法律では青少年有害情報は例示にされるに留まっている。 （定義）
第二条
３ この法律において 「青少年有害情報」とは、インターネットを利用して公衆の閲覧（視聴を含む。以下同じ。）に供されている情報であって青少年の健全な成長を著しく阻害するものをいう。
４ 前項の青少年有害情報を例示すると、次のとおりである。
一 犯罪若しくは刑罰法令に触れる行為を直接的かつ明示的に請け負い、仲介し、若しくは誘引し、又は自殺を直接的かつ明示的に誘引する情報
二 人の性行為又は性器等のわいせつな描写その他の著しく性欲を興奮させ又は刺激する情報
三 殺人、処刑、虐待等の場面の陰惨な描写その他の著しく残虐な内容の情報 参院の内閣委員会審議においても、この例示規定にあたるか否か、個別の該当性を判断する主体は、サーバ管理者やフィルタリングソフト開発事業者など「あくまで民間」であり、個別に有害であることを行政権が判断することは「想定されていない」と笹木先生の答弁で強調されていた（動画で言うと10:50くらいから）。
また、2条4項1号に例示される情報については、誘引罪等の違法情報を含むことが、松井先生の質問により明確化されている（12:20くらいから）。「有害情報には、広く違法情報を含むという理解」で良いということらしい。つまり、この法案では違法と有害情報は区別されておらず、両者の判断はあくまで民間が行う。しかし何らかの法律効果をもたらすものについては、本法とは別の個々の法に照らして処断される。
さて、引用部分を参照していただければわかるように、家出やいじめに関しては規定から落とされている。ただし、これは例示にすぎないから、ここに示されていない情報であっても、民間の機関や事業者が独自に規制対象とすることもできる点は注意が必要だろう。
基本計画で潜脱的に有害情報基準を策定しない
また、独立行政委員会の方は行政計画を策定し、推進する閣僚会議という位置づけに落ち着いている。国の有害情報基準策定への関与はかなり薄まったと見て良い。 第八条 内閣府に、インターネット青少年有害情報対策・環境整備推進会議（以下「会議」という。）を置く。
２ 会議は、次に掲げる事務をつかさどる。
一 第十二条第一項の基本計画を作成し、及びその実施を推進すること。
二 前号に掲げるもののほか、青少年が安全に安心してインターネットを利用できるようにするための施策に関する重要事項について審議すること。 第十二条 会議は、青少年が安全に安心してインターネットを利用できるようにするための施策に関する基本的な計画（以下「基本計画」という。）を定めなければならない。
２ 基本計画は、次に掲げる事項について定めるものとする。
一 青少年が安全に安心してインターネットを利用できるようにするための施策についての基本的な方針
二 インターネットの適切な利用に関する教育及び啓発活動の推進に係る施策に関する事項
三 青少年有害情報フィルタリングソフトウェアの性能の向上及び利用の普及等に係る施策に関する事項
四 青少年のインターネットの適切な利用に関する活動を行う民間団体等の支援その他青少年が安全に安心してインターネットを利用できるようにするための施策に関する重要事項 さらに、松井先生の質問によって、基本計画において有害情報の基準を策定することは「想定していない」し、表現の自由や民間の自主的取組みを尊重するという「法の趣旨に合わない」ため、有害情報基準策定を基本計画に盛り込むことはないとの答弁が引き出された（21:10くらいから）。
この質問と答弁によって立法者の言質が取れたわけだ。しかし、後述する附則3条のこともあり、基本計画や法改正によって趣旨の逸脱が行われないよう、注視する必要があると思う。
なお、閣僚会議の必要性については、省庁間の「横の連携を取る」ことが主眼であり、縦割りの弊害を取り除くためであるという（18:20くらいから）。
3年後といわず、今秋がひとつの山場 今回は附則3条による3年後の見直しが求められている。 （検討）
第三条 政府は、この法律の施行後三年以内に、この法律の施行の状況について検討を加え、その結果に基づいて必要な措置を講ずるものとする。 一度作った法律を廃止するということは、政局に影響を及ぼすような例外を除き、経験則上非現実的だと思う。だから、規制が廃止・軽減される方向で検討が進む可能性は少ない。
逆に、 「ネットのせい」と受け止められるような事件が発生してしまい、感情的規制強化論が起きるであるとか、あるいは「民間だけの対応では実効性が見られない」ことを理由として、なし崩し的に規制強化へ流れてしまう可能性の方が余程高い。
しかも、3年を待たずに規制強化の契機は訪れる可能性が高い。附則で違法情報対策を速やかに議論することになっているし、今秋にある臨時国会でのブロッキング議論がもうひとつの山場になるだろう。
昨日を歴史のターニングポイントにしないために、出来ることからやって行きたい（とりあえず今はMIAUの声明を下書きしているところだ）。
In a blistering attack , Nevada ’s Republican senator John Ensign has launched an offensive against solar energy lobbyists , ahead of a crucial vote on renewable energy tax credits .
Breaking ranks with the the state ’s increasingly important solar industry , Ensign said that efforts by the Solar Energy Industry Association to force his hand on tax breaks had in fact had the opposite effect of “ personally alienating ” him and other senators .
In a scathing letter , later released to the press , Ensign accused the lobby group of squandering goodwill by accusing him of favouring “ billionaire hedge fund managers ” over job creation in Nevada .
Indicating the depth of his feelings on the issue , he went on to say “ It is rare to have such overwhelming bipartisan support in today ’s political climate but the solar industry had it and your association ’s leadership squandered it . ”
Nevada solar executives had privately become increasingly unhappy with the Senator ’s record of voting against bills containing the tax credits .
Ensign said that he opposed the bills because the funds for tax breaks would have been raised by increasing the burden on the oil and gas industry .
Earlier this spring , he co-sponsored an alternative approach , calling for tax credits without the corresponding offsets .
It made it through the Senate by a vote of 88 - 8 , but has become bogged down in the House .
Last Tuesday , the senate voted to block progress on the Consumer First Energy Act and the Renewable Energy and Job Creation Act .
However , with a new vote expected this week , the rift is likely to dismay observers hopeful of progress on the hotly disputed tax credits bill .
A block would be particularly damaging to the renewables industry , which wants to make investment decisions against a background of long - term stability in renewable energy policy .
Other posts on the U.S. Senate and Renewable Energy Policy :
“ Senate to Vote on Renewables as Early as Today ”
“ Senate Passes Renewable Energy Tax Credits .
Should n’t I Be More Excited ? ”

Hope you 've gotten your fill of Dan Lyons ' great Secret Diary Of Steve Jobs blog , because it 's going away .
Unlike previous burials that Dan has given Fake Steve , the one he posted today is real .
While Dan , who created the blog while working at Forbes magazine , has the rights to take the site with him to his new gig at Newsweek , he tells us that he is indeed done with Fake Steve .
Except that this is Fake Steve / Real Dan Lyons , so it 's never exactly cut and dry :
As a Bits item notes , Dan is done with the Fake Steve blog , but he has sold the movie rights to Hollywood middlemen Media Rights Capital , and it 's possible that the character could show up in other formats .
Use your imagination here .
Oh .
And did we mention the greatest hits book , out today ?
Of course , Dan is n't done blogging .
RealDanLyons , his personal site , is currently in hibernation , but should be up and running sometime next week .
Not clear whether how or if he 'll incorporate it into his new Newsweek gig .
And while we 're working as Dan 's mouthpiece , we may as well go ahead and clear up a few other issues :
Dan is n't writing about the new iPhone for Newsweek this week , because Dan does n't work for Newsweek yet .
He starts in the fall .
But !
It 's unclear whether Newsweek , which used to get primo access to all things Apple ( AAPL ) , including sit - downs with El Jobso himself , will get squat from the company going forward .
" I hear that I 've been blacklisted , and that Apple reached out directly to Newsweek to complain about my hiring "
Dan tells us .
Seriously .
The film industry has a long reputation for unfinished screenplays or projects abandoned because of expensive production costs and a hundred other reasons .
These are the top 10 films that actually started filming but were never finished or released for one reason or another .
10 Uncle Tom ’s Fairy Tales 1968
Uncle Tom ’s Fairy Tales was to be the first film starring Richard Pryor .
The movie was about a white man who goes on trial for having raped a black woman .
At the time of the making of this film , Richard Pryor ’s wife complained that he was paying more attention to the film than he was to her .
The film was eventually canceled and his wife shredded the negative .
No copies of the film were known to have survived , however in 2005 , scenes from the film appeared in a retrospective while Pryor was being honored by the Directors Guild of America .
There is still a law suite pending to this day between Pryor ’s ex wife and his daughter over this film and who should own it .
9 Who Killed Bambi 1978
Russ Meyer was set to direct this film , which was to be the first featuring the Sex Pistols .
The movie was intended as a pseudo - punk version of A Hard Day ’s Night .
Just a day and a half worth of shooting were completed as the filming stopped when the executives at 20th Century Fox read the script .
The Producers and decision - makers were so shocked that they pulled all funding .
The footage that exists shows Sting ( the leader of a pop group called The Blow - Waves ) assaulting drummer Paul Cook as he stops to ask for directions .
8 Kaleidoscope 1971
This film was to be a groundbreaking experimental film directed by Alfred Hitchcock .
If it had been completed it would probably have been Hitchcock ’s darkest film .
Even Hitchcock himself worried that some scenes might be too frightening for the audience .
Kaleidoscope was the story of a bodybuilder who was a serial rapist and killer .
David Hemmings and Michael Caine had been suggested as leads in the film .
In the script there are several murders , including an attempt on the life of a policewoman .
Hitchcock planned to experiment with innovative filming techniques such as hand - held filming and natural light .
He also wanted to tell the entire story from the perspective of the killer .
Unfortunately MCA studios stopped the project because they thought that the protagonist was too repulsive .
All that remains now is an hour - long tape of silent footage .
Some of these ideas would be recycled into his 1972 movie “ Frenzy ” .
7 The Works 1978
This film was to be the first entirely 3D computer animated film .
The film was about a villainous giant ant - like creature .
The original meaning of the word “ robot ” in many Slavic languages inspired the name .
The story was set somewhere in the future when a last World War had led to an advanced computer network , which now controlled the world .
The main problem for this film was the fact that technology could not cope with a full feature - length CGI movie .
The film was worked on from 1978 until 1986 .
In the end it became clear the movie would never be finished so the project was abandoned .
However it is said that all the technology and software that was created for this project made the effort worthwhile .
6 Dus 1997
Dus was to be a Bollywood action film directed by Mukul S.Anand .
The storyline was about terrorism and shows an anti-terrorist intelligence officer who is sent on a mission to find an Afghan terrorist .
Shooting of the film began in Utah , which was to have depicted scenes of Kashmir – the major setting of the film .
40 % of the shooting had been completed before director Anand suddenly died .
The film was abandoned never to be completed or released .
The music soundtrack of the film was released while the film was still in production .
5 The Man Who Killed Don Quixote 2000
Terry Gilliam directed this feature film .
The shooting stopped within a week due to an injury to star Jean Rochefort who was playing Quixote .
The movie was set to have been one of the biggest European films ever made , with a budget of $ 32 million .
The entire movie would have been filmed in Spain and throughout Europe .
The character Toby was to be played by Johnny Depp , and Vanessa Paradis would have been his love interest .
When Rochefort , ( an able horseman ) attempted to ride it was obvious that he was in pain and required assistance dismounting and walking .
It was discovered after he flew to his doctor in Paris that he had a double herniated disc .
When it became apparent that he would not be able to return , Gilliam decided to scrap the project .
There may be some plans to restart the production in 2009 with hopes that Michael Palin will play Quixote alongside Johnny Depp .
4 The Day the Clown Cried 1972
The Day the Clown Cried was a film directed by , and starring , Jerry Lewis .
The movie is about a depressed , formerly great German circus clown named Helmut Dorque during the beginning of the Holocaust .
Dorque is eventually fired from the circus and is arrested at a bar by the Gestapo for mocking the Fuhrer .
Dorque is then imprisoned in a Nazi camp for political prisoners .
Lewis reportedly lost forty pounds for the concentration camp scenes .
Unfortunately the producers were not fronted with sufficient finances , causing Lewis to began paying for the production costs with his own money .
Lewis reportedly has the only known videocassette copy of the film , which he keeps locked away in his office .
The location of the original film negative is unknown .
Lewis refuses to discuss the film at all in interviews to this day .
3 Dark Blood 1993
Dark Blood is about a character named Boy ( played by River Phoenix ) .
Boy is a hermit who lives on a nuclear testing site waiting for the end of the world while making dolls that he believe have magical powers .
He meets a couple in the Arizona desert due to their car breaking down and he holds them prisoners because he desires the woman and wants to create a better world with her .
Dark Blood was never completed due to the death of River Phoenix in 1993 .
The crew was 11 days shy of completing production .
Because the film had to be abandoned , Phoenix ’s mother was sued due to loss of expenses .
The unfinished film is owned entirely by George Sluizer who wrote the film .
He has hinted that he might use it as footage in a documentary about River ’s life .
2 The Other Side of the Wind 1972
Anyone who is a film buff would know that an Orson Welles film would have to be somewhere on this list .
This Welles film was to star John Huston , Peter Bogdanovich and Dennis Hopper .
Some believe that because this film was filled with so much sex and violence it was an attempt to revive Welles career .
Apparently 96 % of the film was complete but financial problems prevented it from being finished .
Showtime cable network had guaranteed the money to complete the film , but a lawsuit by Welles ’ daughter caused Showtime to withdraw its funding .
In April 2007 Bogdanovich said in a press report that a deal was made to complete the movie .
His goal was to release the film in 2008 but Bogdanovich recently said there is still over a year ’s worth of work to be done .
1 Something ’s Got to Give 1962
Something ’s Got to Give is probably the most famous unfinished film in Hollywood history .
This was to be a light comedy and was a remake of the movie My Favorite Wife .
The film starred Marilyn Monroe , Dean Martin , Cyd Charisse and was directed by George Cukor .
Monroe had recently undergone gallbladder surgery and had dropped over 25 pounds reaching the lowest weight of her adult life .
On the first day of production , Monroe called the producer to let him know that she had a severe sinus infection , and would not be on the set that morning .
Similar delays continued on an almost daily basis and the film quickly turned into a costly disaster .
Because of the delays Monroe was fired and the film cancelled and shelved .
Marilyn Monroe spiraled further into decline and died later that year in 1962 .
In the video clip above you can see the first 10 minutes of the film .

We bury them underground , drown them in lagoons , or shove them out to sea — no matter how remote a site , it may be full of the toxic by - products of modern life .
Nuclear waste and heavy metals are just some of the noxious residue of our everyday existence .
To reverse the damage , scientists turn to both innovative technologies and peculiar organisms .
Chlorine Cuisine
If they make their way into the groundwater , chlorinated wastes , like those found in dry - cleaning fluids and paint thinner , can cause liver problems and cancer in people .
But some bacteria find these chemicals quite palatable :
When Dehalococcoides ethenogenes comes in contact with the chemicals , it feasts on chlorinated compounds , converting them into harmless gases .
Fly Ash Bricks
In the process of generating electricity , U.S. coal plants spew more than 70 million tons a year of a radio­active waste called fly ash .
Now a Missouri company has found a way to turn the ash into bricks , an innovation that reduces fly ash while providing an extra benefit :
The bricks soak up toxic mercury from the air .
Purging Pesticides
White rot fungi , common in the forests of North America , use special enzymes to convert the carbon in trees to energy .
These same enzymes can oxidize environmental pollutants such as pesticides and PCBs , rendering them benign .
Flushing Iron
Metal toxins commonly found at mining sites could be treated with the stinky remains of human wastewater .
The human waste , rife with iron , would be especially useful if dumped at sites loaded with cadmium , lead , and arsenic .
The iron would readily react with the other metals and keep them from dissolving into nearby groundwater .
Plutonium Pyramids
Hematite , a shiny black mineral sometimes used to make jewelry , can soak up plutonium and uranium waste from nuclear plants .
Scientists recently found that hematite crystals placed in acid grow pyramid - like structures on their surface .
As the structures form , contaminants can settle into tiny pockets in the hematite crystal , where they could remain stable for hundreds of years .

Will GPS Make Us Dumb ?
In July , Apple will release the new iPhone 3G with better GPS technology .
June 17 , 2008  --
For most people -- the cab driver , the tourist , the business traveler -- the ubiquitous GPS has become a lifeline , giving directions to the nearest bathroom , a pizza joint or the shortest route to the office .
But , just like with spell - checker before it , some experts believe that the guiding device gives less than what it takes away .
The price we pay for the convenience , they say , could be our sense of direction .
For years , the Web - surfing faithful have used Internet - based maps and route finders , like MapQuest and Google Maps , to guide them to their destinations .
These online options bring travelers instantly calculated directions , without having to scrutinize colorful representations of roads .
But now , as BlackBerrys and the new iPhone that hits stores on July 11 become GPS - enabled , the world will see a drastic leap in hand - held technology , as well .
As the prices on these devices drop -- the new iPhone will cost only about $ 200 -- more people will be able to possess these GPS phones .
This new affordability may increase our addiction to GPS , according to Ian White , founder of Urban Mapping , a company that licenses geographic data for use in online maps , like Google Maps .
" When we develop a crutch for technology , we lose the ability to do that which we did previously , " White said .
" It could n't be more true .
People become more and more reliant , and their expectations get bigger and bigger , and if technology does n't deliver , they get frustrated . "
This dependence can already be seen in the use of GPS in cars , which has become more prevalent .
If other phone makers follow Apple 's footsteps , look for GPS to become even more commonplace .
" I think GPS is going to continue to be embedded in more and more digital devices , including kinds that we have n't even imagined yet , " Middlebury College geography professor Anne Knowles said .
" Any human activity takes place somewhere .
I think we could see GPS units in our watches , in credit cards , or for any human activity that relies on knowing where you are or planning where you 're going to go . "
Kevin Slavin , managing director and co-founder of area / code , a company that makes games based on geography , said that getting lost helps develop our sense of place , and contributes to a functioning society .
" There is a social function of being lost , " Slavin said .
" And that social function of being lost will itself be lost .
Think about how many times in the last month or so you have asked somebody for directions , or somebody has asked you for directions .
That bit of social communication , in which a stranger and native meet at some point , will slowly ebb away .
The question is :
Will we feel ourselves to be natives everywhere , or to be strangers everywhere ? "
But soon , people may not need to have any sense of direction whatsoever .
The GPS on the iPhone allows a person to search for a type of place , such as a Chinese restaurant , eliminating search time for places people do n't yet know exist , but also ending that human impulse to explore .
The technology may just be the beginning of a new , previously unthinkable form of localization , according to White .
" I remember hearing this idea from well over 10 years ago , " he said .
" You walk down the street , you walk by a Starbucks , and your phone buzzes and says , ' Get a dollar off your next latte ! '
That 's not even close to happening yet .
But what the iPhone has done that is very much popularized , and has been made incredibly easy and elegant , is a way to derive value from your location . "
Jeff Han , a consulting research scientist for New York University 's department of computer science , who developed an interactive multi- touch screen that includes GPS functions , foresees a decline in GPS popularity due to privacy issues , after an initial surge in use .
" What does it mean when everyone can potentially point out where all their friends are ? " he said .
" Instead of actively calling all of your friends , you can say , ' Oh yeah , a few of them are over here . '
So , that brings in social issues , and those are the things not yet worked out by cell phone companies .
" All of those things are being experimented , and I think that people will realize that they are giving up too much information about themselves , and there will be a little bit of backtracking , " Han said .
Of course , use of GPS is n't all negative .
One potential -- and perhaps obvious -- beneficial change will be cutting down on travel time .
People will not spend long hours walking around looking for a hidden street if their cell phones can show them the way .
Travelers will most likely feel more confident in new locations .
Parents may give their children more freedom to walk by themselves at younger ages ; their phones will take them home .
Knowles views the negative effects of widely - used GPS as intertwined with the potential for humans to expand their understanding of space .
" One effect of an increased dependence on GPS will be that peoples ' ability to read maps will further decay , " Knowles said .
" Americans are generally poor map readers .
Some cannot read maps at all because it 's not part of our education .
" But what will grow , instead , will be better geographic imagination and awareness .
People will see the connections between places more clearly -- not quite as accurately -- but will better imagine how to get from one place to another because of this technology . "
Asked if his remarks could be interpreted as trying to talk down the stock of the two companies , which have been plummeting recently , he said : " I 've been short Fannie Mae since I came here three years ago or four years ago .
This is bad for America , who cares if I make some money ... I 'm short lots of banks . "
The Treasury Department and the Federal Reserve on Sunday offered massive aid to bolster confidence in Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and head off a potential financial market meltdown , as the two finance around $ 5 trillion , or about half , of U.S. home loans .
But investors ' enthusiasm for the measures was short - lived .
" In two years or three years , when six or eight other people are failing , America wo n't have any more bullets left , " Rogers said , adding that Sunday 's move increased the burden of public debt and did not solve the root cause of the crisis .
" The patient has cancer , Band Aids wo n't help . "
Letting the two fail would throw the country in recession but would ensure that the system is cleansed , he added .
" It would cause problems in the economy but we 've got problems in the economy anyway . "
Rogers said he was not investing in oil currently because the price was too high , but that new reserves have to be discovered quickly for the prices to come down .
He also said he was investing in airlines , whose stocks have recently been hammered by fears the fuel price would cut into their profits .
" I am buying airlines .
If you fly a lot , you 'll see that you can't get a seat , the rates are going higher .
The capacity is going down and the demand is still there , " Rogers said .

Some techs are techs , and some need to find a desk job real fast .
One night at the NOC [ed .
Network Operations Center ] , I was working with my team on routine network maintenance .
One of the items on our list was to install two PHY [ ed .
Physical Layer Device ] boards into a router .
A basic job , although we all knew this particular card was a tricky one to install : the cards were thin and the guide levers had to be turned 180 degrees and then snapped into place before you could put the board in the slot .
If you do n't know how to do it , you realize it very quickly .
But in this case , the field tech doing the install was in another location and we had him on speakerphone , and he was new on the job and apparently had not absorbed anything about this router in training .
We told him to go ahead and install the cards one at a time and to wait before installing the second , and we waited there on the phone expecting him to return to the phone for aid or at least to verify that the first went well .
After 15 or 20 minutes of hearing the field tech curse , strain , grunt and generally get pissed off , suddenly there was just silence for 10 minutes .
Worried , we tried desperately to get the field tech back on the phone , but to no avail .
We then heard this loud , piercing , and utterly chilling noise like metal being hit with metal along with lots of other sounds you should never hear in a datacenter .
Ever .
And all the time he 's still cursing at the router , but now it is triumphant .
Back at the NOC , we were just sitting there speechless as error messages start scrolling and we lost contact with first one router and then the other .
Something had gone very wrong ...
[ To be continued ]
Tales from the Field will hopefully be a recurring segment on this blog , offering a voice to the folks who install the gear , flip the switches , and do all the real work holding the internet together that we do n’t hear about in the press .
Do you have a story from the field to share ?

Above , the small house that dripped blood
Echoing the bizarre scenes from horror movies ( and the dubious associated claims ) , a small house in the outskirts of Sao Paulo , Brazil , dripped blood .
Deputy officer Marco Antonio Ferreira , who investigates the case , have discarded the idea that foul play may have been involved , as the people who live in the house are a retired elderly couple above all suspicion .
This past Sunday and Monday night , around 6:30 PM , they complained about a liquid that looked like blood that started to drip from the walls from a height of around 15 cm in the bathroom , living room and one of the bathrooms .
“ I was already going to archive the case , as in a preliminary analysis we thought the liquid could be paint .
But it is blood ” , Ferreira told the news .
He also dismissed the hypothesis of a homicide in the house .
“ Blood is tissue .
It only comes from a living person .
I visited the house and I have seen that everything was fine .
There is nothing wrong there .
I may even go back there to have a cup of coffee with the couple , ” he joked .
The couple is scared and does n’t want to talk with the press .
They do n’t event want to be named .
But if that was n’t bizarre enough , the last bit is simply priceless .
The neighborhood where everything is happening is called …
“ Jardim Bizarro ” , or “ Bizarre Garden ” .
People are seemingly very Catholic around there , including the couple , who first things first , immediately called a priest .
But they do n’t want to move .
A group of around twenty Catholic ladies also visited the house to pray and help clean the mess .
Another neighbor , identified as Angela , told that the couple is above any suspicion — “ I know them for years .
They lived here for 38 years .
For my part , I lived here for the past 50 years .
Nothing like that ever happened . ”
Good for them .
She also tells how the neighborhood may be finally living up to its name , as “ everything around here has always been very peaceful .
But around a week ago , a young man was murdered , another was thrown from a train and now , blood is dripping from nowhere .
We are scared . ”
“ They say the fact that our village has ‘ bizarre ’ in the name attracts bad luck .
It may well be .
We should change .
But ‘ Bizarro ’ is the surname of a very traditional family of the region .
They owned a construction material shop in the past .
A name like any other ” .
Wait a minute .
The Bizarro family owned a construction material shop , and now blood is dripping from the walls ?
I see a connection there .
I hope they kept the receipts for the material in the walls .
The Bizarro family may have things to explain .
More updates in this bloody case as they come .

Sex may not be quite the same for a while , depending on your treatments and the way you feel about your body .
Sex may not be quite the same for a while , depending on your treatments and the way you feel about your body .
CorbisYou might be one of the lucky few whose sex life cruises through breast cancer diagnosis and treatment without so much as a bounce .
More likely , there are bumps in the road or you may have stalled out altogether .
According to the National Cancer Institute , one in two women treated for breast or gynecologic cancer experiences some combination of low desire and pain with intercourse .
Below , a list of the most common problems and some expert suggestions on what to do about it .
1. Fatigue
Breast cancer typically brings on one of the biggest libido - killers : fatigue .
Recovering from a mastectomy — and perhaps reconstruction — can sap your energy , as can chemotherapy and radiation .
" Fatigue is a bigger problem because it can be pervasive and it can last a lot longer " than other physical changes such as hair loss or dry skin , says Helen L. Coons , PhD , president and clinical director of Women 's Mental Health Associates in Philadelphia .
2. Vaginal dryness
If you 're on hormone treatment , you may be plunged into early menopause , and for some people that includes low desire and vaginal dryness , which can make sex painful .
( Younger women and women who've had chemotherapy are generally more likely to report problems with sex . )
Leslie R. Schover , PhD , professor of behavioral science at the University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston , suggests a vaginal lubricant and / or a vaginal dilator to make sex less painful .
" Being on an antidepressant or anti-anxiety medication can also blunt sexual desire , " she says .

Rep. Wayne Gilchrest ( R - MD ) speaking on the House floor yesterday on HCR 362 :
Mr. Speaker , I want to speak today on Resolution 362 that is circulating in the House and its impact on policy in the Middle East .
As a result of Resolution 362 and its tightening of sanctions on Iran in a more broader way , will that have a positive impact on America ’s policy in the Middle East ?
Will it have a positive impact on the politics in the Middle East ?
Will it have a positive impact on Iran as far as the conflict between our two nations is concerned ?
I will say , in my judgment , Mr. Speaker , that Resolution 362 will exacerbate , make much more difficult , the problems in the Middle East , the relationship of Iran with its neighbors in the Middle East , and the relationship of Iran with the United States , and the relationship of Iran with the country of Israel .
Let me try to explain why .
If we look at the Middle East right now in a very objective fashion , what is going on in the Middle East right now ?
The geopolitical balance of power in the Middle East right now is fractured .
We are focusing on the conflict in Iraq .
We need as a Nation to focus objectively on the Palestinian - Israeli question , to resolve that issue , to reduce the number of recruits for al Qaeda and the Taliban .
We need to understand that Saudi Arabia , a Sunni country , does not want Iraq , a Shia country , to become an Iranian satellite .
We need to understand that Iran , who lost more men dead in a conflict with Iraq just a few years ago than we lost in World War I , World War II , Korea , and Vietnam combined , wants to have some influence in the Middle East and certainly with what will go on in Iraq .
What will influence the direction the Middle East will take in the decades to come ?
There is violent conflict there .
There is political conflict there .
There is mistrust in the Middle East .
Let me use a quote from Sam Rayburn , former Speaker of the House .
“ Any mule can kick a barn door down , but it takes carpenters to rebuild that door and that barn . ”
We need carpenters .
We need diplomats .
More conflict , more restrictions , more sanctions is going to further exacerbate the problem in the Middle East and its relationship with the country of Iran .
One other quick comment .
Iran is not an Arab country .
Iran is a Persian nation that speaks Farsi , that does not speak Arabic .
It is a nation of Shias with their own brand of Islam .
Knowledge and an informed policy in the Middle East , a surge of diplomacy , can make a key difference .
Let me go back and express some precedence of the past about diplomacy and where it worked .
When Nikita Khrushchev said he was going to bury the United States , what was Eisenhower ’s response ?
He invited Nikita Khrushchev to the United States to tour the Nation , and it began to lessen the conflict between the two countries .
What did President Kennedy do when there were deployable nuclear weapons in Cuba aimed at the United States ?
He negotiated his way out of that conflict and saved a catastrophe .
What did Nixon do after Mao Zedong said it would be worth half the population of China being destroyed if we could destroy the capitalists in America ?
What did Nixon do ?
He had a dialogue .
He went to China .
What happened when we did not have a dialogue , some understanding of Ho Chi Minh ?
A million people died .
Today in the Middle East we certainly need a strong military , we need a strong intelligence .
But the aspect that is missing in the Middle East is what Eisenhower said was so critical in foreign policy ; that is , consensus and dialogue .
Mr. Speaker , there are a number of Members in this house that have started a long time ago , a couple of years , beginning a dialogue with the Iranians .
Just last fall , 58 Members of this House on both sides of the aisle signed a letter to the parliament in Iran asking for a parliamentary exchange ; 58 Members of Republicans and Democrats .
That letter was hand - delivered by some of us in Lisbon to Iranian parliamentarians .
They took it to Iran .
And what is their response to us ?
They want a dialogue .
There are members of the Iranian parliament that want a dialogue .
Consensus and dialogue .
We need more carpenters .
Vote against Resolution 362 .
Angry passenger leaves jet through emergency hatch
GEORGETOWN , GUYANA — Guyanese authorities say a first - class airline passenger was so angry at seeing economy passengers leave a jetliner before him that he yanked open an emergency hatch and slid down the chute .
Police spokesman Sealall Persaud says the Guyanese man identified as Satyanand Christopher appeared to be intoxicated after the Delta Airlines flight from New York .
Persaud said Sunday that local police arrested Christoper , who was quickly released on bail after the Friday incident .
Delta spokesman Junior Horatio says the U.S. carrier plans to file charges against the man for interfering with flight crew members .
The tooth - protecting sugar substitute xylitol has been incorporated into gummy bears to produce a sweet snack that may prevent dental problems .
Research published today in the open access journal BMC Oral Health describes how giving children four of the xylitol bears three times a day during school hours results in a decrease in the plaque bacteria that cause tooth decay .
Xylitol is a naturally occurring sugar alcohol that is frequently used as a sweetener .
It has been shown to reduce levels of the harmful mutans streptococci ( MS ) bacteria that are known to cause tooth decay .
While xylitol chewing gums are available , they are not considered to be suitable for younger children .
This research was led by Kiet A. Ly from the University of Washington .
He says , " For xylitol to be successfully used in oral health promotion programmes amongst primary - school children , an effective means of delivering xylitol must be identified .
Gummy bears would seem to be more ideal than chewing gum . "
The children in the study were given four bears three times a day , containing different concentrations of xylitol .
The results show that after six weeks of gummy bear snacking , the levels of harmful MS bacteria in the children 's plaque was significantly reduced .
According to Ly " Based on our findings , it is feasible to develop a clinical trial of a gummy - based caries prevention programme .
Such a study is now being carried out in the East Cleveland primary school district ( Ohio , USA ) . "
Tooth decay is one of the most common diseases in the world .
The distribution of Xylitol gummy bears in the school setting may help to reduce the burden of this foremost chronic childhood disease in Europe and the US .

Lo scontrino elettronico è uno strumento digitale innovativo che l’Esecutivo e Agenzia delle Entrate hanno fortemente …
Larry J Sabato , professor of politics at the University of Virginia , takes a close look at Hillary Clinton 's arguments that she deserves the Democratic Party 's presidential nomination .
Give Hillary Clinton credit .
She has shown toughness , stamina , and persistence in one of the longest presidential campaigns in American history .
If super - delegates back Hillary Clinton , will they alienate loyal black voters ?
She has fought hard and come back time and again in the 2008 primary season , defying the pundits who insisted on writing her political obituary prematurely .
She has held the charismatic phenomenon named Barack Obama almost to a draw in the fight for votes and delegates in the Democratic party 's nominating battle .
As some of Obama 's weaknesses become more apparent , her arguments are drawing new attention , and at least a few Democratic leaders are considering them .
No -one is likely to agree on exactly what the popular vote is , or how it should be counted - the notion ought to be shelved
All that being true , it 's still very unlikely she will overcome Obama 's lead .
With just seven states ( plus Puerto Rico and Guam ) remaining on the primary schedule , Obama is ahead by close to 160 elected ( or pledged ) delegates and , overall , by about 130 delegates , once the super - delegates are included .
This may not sound like many in a convention that will host more than 4,000 delegates , but party rules make it difficult to gain a sizeable number of delegates quickly .
( Incredibly , you can win a big state and net a mere handful of delegates .
The Democrats have developed a system so fair it is unfair . )
Changing the maths
Here 's the basic dilemma for Hillary Clinton :
How can she convince senior Democrats to turn their backs on the most loyal party constituency , African - Americans , who regularly give 90 % of their votes to party candidates ?
For the first time , one of their own has a real chance to become the presidential nominee and the occupant of the White House .
The anger in the black community would be palpable and long - lasting if Obama is sent packing .
Democratic women appear unlikely to respond in the same fashion if the first serious woman candidate is turned aside .
Worry among super - delegates about Obama 's viability in the fall is not enough .
The only conceivable scenarios that might change the present nominating math are : a campaign - ending scandal or gaffe by Obama
a highly improbable series of victories by Hillary Clinton in primaries she is expected to lose ( such as North Carolina and Oregon )
a raft of polls showing Clinton defeating McCain handily while Obama is losing to McCain decisively ( most current polls show relatively little difference in the Obama - McCain and Clinton - McCain national match - ups , though the prospective contests in individual states vary considerably )
How can it be that Clinton is so unlikely to prevail , especially close on the heels of her solid , impressive 9.2 % victory in Pennsylvania on 22 April ?
Why would n't that victory generate significant momentum for Clinton , just at the moment when the remaining super - delegates prepare to make their decisive choice ?
Did n't her 214,000 - vote plurality in the Keystone State vault her into the popular - vote lead nationally , as she claimed ?
The size and breadth of Clinton 's triumph in Pennsylvania certainly demonstrated the emerging limitations of Obama 's appeal , not least the disaffection of many whites , blue - collar workers , and low - income Democrats .
But it almost certainly will be Obama , not Clinton , who is on the November ballot under the Democratic label .
Michigan and Florida Take Clinton 's claim about the popular vote .
On the morning after Pennsylvania , she insisted that she had taken a narrow popular - vote lead , about 15.12 million to nearly 15 million for Obama .
But this is classic " new math " , where the numerical answer obtained is often less important than the agile mental gymnastics used to get there .
Clinton 's total relies on two very dubious assumptions .
First , one must incorporate the primary results from Florida and Michigan , two January contests excluded by the Democratic National Committee for violating the scheduling rules set by the party .
This is no minor sum of votes - 2,344,318 , to be exact .
Barack Obama has regularly done better than Hillary Clinton in caucuses
But no even - handed person would contend that Michigan , whose primary occurred on 15 January , should be part of the equation .
Barack Obama 's name was not even on the ballot .
The vote total cited by Clinton conveniently excludes three caucus states won by Obama , in Iowa , Maine , and Washington .
( Nevada , won by Clinton , is also left out of the tally . )
No -one knows the exact number of votes cast for each candidate in these four states since the state parties , by tradition , refuse to release the data .
Eliminating Michigan , the Obama - Clinton match - up shows an Obama edge of a couple hundred thousand votes .
Striking Florida brings it to about a half - million - vote Obama plurality .
And the unknown caucus results would add at least 100,000 to his lead .
Comparing like with unlike
This discussion of caucus states raises another interesting subject .
How can one compare primary and caucus states at all ?
By their very nature , primaries attract a large electorate in most states .
A caucus is a very different political animal , requiring hours of commitment from each participating individual .
The concept of the national popular vote is borrowed from the general election , when it makes more sense
The caucus also is inflexible , beginning at a set , mandatory time .
There are no absentee ballots and no excuses for troops abroad , medical personnel who must attend to the sick , or elderly individuals who cannot brave a lengthy , stressful outing .
Caucus participation is usually just a fraction of the turnout that would have occurred had the state held a primary .
Therefore , the national vote total is heavily skewed to the states holding primaries , and this total mixes primary apples and caucus oranges in an unenlightening way .
The concept of the national popular vote is borrowed from the general election , when it makes more sense .
However , in the nominating season the idea is dubious , and it is not a particularly useful measure for the undecided super - delegates .
Nevertheless , it has been bandied about so much by the campaigns and news media that it has now become an inescapable yardstick of electoral validity for Clinton and Obama .
Key states
Other questions about the vote mathematics are also compelling .
Should the voting results in November 's likely competitive states - the ones we often call purple - a mixture of Republican red and Democratic blue - be given special weight in the popular - vote formula ?
After all , the purpose of the nominating contest is to pick a candidate who can win the general election .
Both Clinton and Obama have won states critically important to a Democratic majority in November
Hillary Clinton has pushed this interpretation , but only up to a point .
She wants her wins in competitive , significant states such as Ohio and Pennsylvania to be determinants for the super - delegates , yet she ignores Barack Obama 's victories in medium - sized toss - up states such as Colorado and Virginia .
With apologies to George Orwell , all states are equal , but some are more equal than others .
Overall , though , this game is pointless since both Clinton and Obama have won states critically important to a Democratic electoral college majority in November .
Different voters
The flaw in the state - based argument is also fundamental .
Party primary electorates do not resemble the November electorates in the vast majority of states , so primary results tell us surprisingly little in most states about how a party presidential nominee will fare in the general election .
Think of it this way - perhaps 35 million Americans will have voted in all the Democratic primaries and caucuses by June , but the November voter turnout could reach 135 million people - and those extra 100 million voters are different , both in ideological and partisan terms , than the 35 million early - birds .
US territories
An ancillary issue is whether the U.S. territories , none of which has electoral college votes in November , should even be included in the party nominating system .
In an extremely close race , their delegates could decide the outcome of a presidential nomination , and potentially the Presidency itself .
Should Puerto Rico , voting on 1 June , have more delegates than half the American states , as the Democrats have assigned ?
Neither Clinton nor Obama will raise this concern , of course , but unbiased observers ought to do so .
In most conventions , the territorial votes are a harmless matter , but every now and then , the unintended consequences of their inclusion could become enormous .
The long and short of the debate over the popular vote is this - no - one is likely to agree on exactly what it is , or how it should be counted .
There are considerable flaws inherent in the concept .
The popular - vote notion ought to be shelved - but naturally , in this endlessly contentious campaign season , it will not be .

Now that the Bureau of Land Management is deferring solar projects on public land , the forecast for solar energy seems a bit cloudy .
What happened ?
Just over a year ago , the BLM was actively encouraging solar projects to be shuttled through in a “ timely manner . ”
Then it teamed up with the Department of Energy “ to assess the environmental , social , and economic impacts associated with solar energy development . ”
So what are the potentially negative environmental impacts of solar installations ?
For starters , the BLM has identified these three : energy use and accompanying emissions required for manufacturing plants , hazardous materials used in production , and land use disrupting natural habitats and wildlife .
But solar tends to come out favorably when pitted against building , say , another coal plant .
And with all this talk of a recession , why is the BLM trying to stunt an industry that ’s creating thousands of new jobs across the country ?
The 2006 - 2007 solar installation boom generated 6,000 new jobs and injected $ 2 billion into the U.S. economy .
The BLM flip - flopping would n’t have anything to do with an administration hand protecting traditional energy industries , would it ?

You want a Republican super - lobbyist ?
I 'll show you a super - lobbyist ...
As you may have heard , Republican fundraiser and lobbyist Stephen Payne was caught on tape offering meetings with Dick Cheney and Condi Rice in exchange for a hefty donation to the George W. Bush presidential library .
Lobbyists are professional bullshit artists .
Any number of influence peddlers will promise face time with high - level officials , the question is who can actually deliver .
Of course , the Bush administration and the library project are frantically trying to disassociate themselves from Payne .
My research confirms that Payne was about as plugged in as you can imagine .
White House press secretary Dana Perino admitted that Payne has probably met with the president on a number of occasions , but she balked when reporters asked her about visitor logs that might establish how often , citing " lawsuits and stuff . "
If even half of what Stephen Payne says about himself is true , there is no question that he had acces to the highest levels of the Bush administration .
Payne was a Bush Pioneer in 2000 and 2004 .
He was also a member of Bush Cheney 04 , George W. Bush for President , and Tom DeLay 's Congressional Committee .
According to a cached copy of Payne 's curriculum vitae that I found on the Worldwide Strategic Partners website ( now scrubbed ) , Payne claims to have been George W. Bush 's personal travel aide during his father ’s 1988 Presidential campaign .
Payne served as Senior Advisor to the NASA Administrator on White House and Congressional Affairs in 2001 , according to the same document .
If the old Worldwide Strategic Partners website is to be believed , Payne has accompanied Bush and Cheney on offical trips , as well as served as an advance man for them : " Currently , Mr. Payne assists the White House as a Senior Advance Representative traveling internationally in advance of and with President Bush and Vice President Cheney , including trips with President Bush to Jordan for the Red Sea Summit ( Mid-East Peace Summit ) , and with Vice President Cheney to the Mid-East , Korea , Kazakhstan , and to Afghanistan for the historic swearing - in of President Hamid Karzai . "
According to the same bio page and a WSP brochure obtained by the Sunday Times , Payne personally advised General Pervez Musharaff and helped secure billions of dollars in aid to Pakistan .
I was able to confirm through public records that Payne was a registered lobbyist for the Islamic Republic of Pakistan and a member of a lobbying group called Team Eagle ( formerly known as Team Barakat ) .
Republican heavyweights Gary Polland and Tim Powers served alongside Payne on Team Eagle .
All three were registered foreign agents of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan .
Another former member of Team Eagle and current member of Worldwide Strategic Partners is Brian Ettinger , a former legislative aide to Sen. Joe Biden .
This is especially interesting because Biden 's name came up in the influence - peddling sting operation .
When it comes to Republican bona fides , Polland 's website bio says it all : " Gary is on a first name basis with President Bush ( he is called " Chairman " ) , his political alliances are widespread from the White House , where he is friends with key Presidential assistants like Karl Rove to United States Senators Cornyn , Graham , Hutchison , and Kyl ; and to House leaders like Eric Canter and Ted Poe .
In Texas , Gary is an advisor to the GOP and its statewide office holders .
Gary is also a key fundraiser for Republicans and is responsible for raising more than $ 3.35 million for Republican candidates and causes during the last ten years . "
Polland is also a McCain fund raiser .
Tim Powers served Bush 's Department of Commerce transition team in 2001 .
He 's a former deputy director of legislative affairs for the Republican National Committee .
Payne 's closest current ties to the executive branch appear to be through the Department of Homeland Security .
According to the WSP brochure , Payne is a member of the Homeland Security Advisory Council , the Rice / Chertoff Commission on Visas , and Border Protection , and the Essential Technologies Task Force of DHS .
Another of Payne 's claims to fame is that he is one of Latvia 's Honorary General Consuls to the United States .
Payne is also a founder and managing partner of Envion Worldwide , a D.C. - based globally networked investment firm that " works to acquire and consolidate natural gas , petroleum , alternative energy , and other power generating assets . "
Envion 's senior advisor is none other than Frank Carlucci , chairman emeritus of the Carlyle Group .
Payne is a strategic limited partner in MSH Ventures and where Carlucci is senior advisor .
Payne is a co-founder of Alliance & Co. , which appears to be led by most of the same people as Envion and MSH , including Carlucci .
Carlucci and Payne both serve on the board of the National Defense University .
Payne is also the president of a firm called Advanced Clean Air Technologies , which allegedly holds an exclusive NASA patent to scrub emissions from coal plants .
These preliminary findings are only scratching the surface of Stephen Payne 's strange network of influence .

A South African court has banned a team of scientists and doctors , including a former adviser to President Thabo Mbeki , from conducting unauthorised clinical trials into the use of vitamin therapies to treat Aids .
German doctor Matthias Rath and American biochemist David Rasnick , who used to sit on Mbeki's Aids advisory council , were among 12 people accused in the Cape high court of supervising illegal medical trials in black townships and selling unregistered vitamin supplements to poor Aids sufferers .
The suit was brought by the South African Medical Association and the Treatment Action Campaign lobby group , which said some of Rath 's patients died after relying on his unproven remedies rather than seeking conventional treatment at state - run clinics .
Judge Dumisani Zondi yesterday ruled against Rath and Rasnick , who is a member of the Dr Rath Health Foundation .
" It is declared that the clinical trials conducted in South Africa ... are unlawful , " Zondi said .
Rath was also barred from publishing any advertisements for his natural Aids remedies - high - dose vitamin pills containing minerals such as iron and iodine - which he claims are more effective that antiretroviral drugs .
His theories have proved hugely controversial in South Africa , which has one of the highest incidences of HIV in the world , with up to 1,000 people dying of Aids - related illnesses every day .
Aids activists say that Rath found a market for his products because of mixed messages from the government , which was slow to acknowledge the scale of the HIV problem and to distribute life - saving drugs .
Mbeki flirted with dissident theories on Aids treatment for years , while the health minister , Manto Tshabalala - Msimang , publicly advocated the use of beetroot , garlic , lemons and African potatoes rather than clinical drugs .
As part of the suit , the South African government was accused of failing in its statutory duty of care for the public by failing to prevent Rath from distributing his products .
Appearing before the court , Tshabalala - Msimang said that Rath 's remedies were not medicines but foodstuffs , and thus fell outside the Medicines Control Council 's regulatory scope .
But Zondi ruled that Tshabalala - Msimang , who had opposed the suit , must now take reasonable measures to prevent Rath from conducting further trials and advertising his products , especially Vitacell , which he says has strong anti-Aids benefits .
Rath , who was not in court to hear the ruling , claimed the lawsuit was an example of " pharmaceutical colonialism " which had " genocidal consequences for the people in the developing world " .
The Treatment Action Campaign welcomed the decision .
" This judgment this morning is a victory for the rule of law and the scientific governance of medicine , " said Nathan Geffen , the group 's spokesman .

Home Why Multi-Core is Easy and Internet is Hard I was recently invited to be on the panel Reinventing Audio and Music Computation for Many - Core Processors at the International Computer Music Conference ( ICMC 2008 ) , Belfast , Ireland , Aug. 2008 .
In my position statement , The Challenges and Opportunities of Multiple Processors : Why Multi-Core Processors are Easy and Internet is Hard , I explain why programming multi-core processors is basically a sociological problem ( the technical problems were solved long ago ) and why programming loosely coupled systems ( like the Internet ) still has a lot of technical challenges .
I am curious to hear what the LtU community thinks about this .

Or nearly so ... that is to say until the President realized that he'd better try to unsay the unspeakable in an interview on Tuesday in Saudi Arabia .
Too late , methinks .
Q I just wanted to ask you if you could just clarify a little bit your statement this morning to OPEC .
What specific action would you like them to take at their first meeting coming up February – THE PRESIDENT : I would like for them to realize that high energy prices affect the economies of consuming nations .
And that if these economies weaken , those economies will eventually be buying fewer barrels of oil .
And having said that , there is not a lot of excess capacity in the marketplace .
What 's happened is , is that demand for energy has outstripped new supply .
And that 's why there 's high price .
And I fully understand how it affects the U.S. consumer .
And my point to His Majesty is going to be , when consumers have less purchasing power because of high prices of gasoline -- in other words , when it affects their families -- it could cause this economy to slow down .
If the economy slows down , there will be less barrels of oil purchased .
You can practically hear echoing in the background an anonymous aide screaming into the presidential ear - piece : " No , no , no !
Dammit , do n't admit the Saudis have authoritá !!
Oil is fungible , say it . "
So Bush quickly corrects the record :
Now in our case , just so the American people know , most of our oil comes from Canada and Mexico .
But oil is a market , it 's globalized , it 's fungible .
That 's what I meant .
Chiz , of course that 's what he meant , it makes perfect sense :
High demand for oil will cause demand to plummet unless the Saudis bail out the US economy .
We do n't need their damned oil , not a bit of it .
Bush has been wandering around the Gulf all week trying ineffectually to boost oil production , but his mincing show in Saudi Arabia was the lowest of low points .
" President Bush is over in the Gulf now begging the Saudis and others to drop the price of oil , " Clinton said .
" How pathetic . "
In fact , as Bush admitted in the same interview , though he'd been in the country for more than a day he still had n't raised the matter with King Abdullah .
This is the man who , during a December 1999 debate , declared that " the president of the United States must jawbone OPEC members to lower the prices . "
Q Did you bring it up already ?
THE PRESIDENT : No , I have not .
I brought it up with members of his administration , and will do so with him tonight on the farm .
Cringeworthy .
And here is how members of Abdullah 's " administration " reacted to the President 's request :
Neither King Abdullah nor Mr. Bush discussed the matter publicly as they met for dinner inside a tentlike hall on Tuesday night , chatting instead about the unusually cold weather .
But Saudi Arabia ’s oil minister , Ali al - Naimi , appeared to rebuff the president ’s appeal earlier in the day .
Saudi Arabia , he said , shared the president ’s concern that a downturn in the American economy could have profound effects around the world , including on the oil market .
He even raised the prospect of " recession , " a word Mr. Bush studiously avoided in the interview , even when pressed about " the R - word . "
But Mr. Naimi said Saudi Arabia would raise production only " when the market justifies it . "
" Presidents and kings have every right , every privilege , to comment or ask or say whatever they want , " Mr. Naimi said in a news conference after Mr. Bush ’s remarks .
" The concern for the U.S. economy is valid , but what affects the U.S. economy is more than the price of oil . "
The Bush interview from Saudi Arabia is a portrait of a man so far out of his depth that the subjects for discussion mainly involved things he could not discuss : the " R " word ( recession , a term not to be uttered - even though Bush had just warned the Saudis to beware it ) ; the over - hyped naval incident in the Strait of Hormuz ( Bush still knew nothing , though he'd been briefed ) ; the Iranian NIE ( he was n't treating it as a dead letter , but then maybe he was ) .
And to top it all off , there was the President trying to explain why he'd decided to send Condoleezza Rice to Baghdad on short notice :
Q So is it basically to promote -- THE PRESIDENT : It 's to , first of all , be there .
And secondly , is to -- there 's a momentum , there 's a political process that has been working that is -- with some of those laws coming to fruition .
Her job is to be there , sitting down with them , explaining how much we appreciate what they 've done , how they need to do more .
And keep moving the process .
Let me be the first to point out that as near as possible that 's jibberish .
Is this really the extent of George Bush 's comprehension of what diplomacy entails ?
Oh , wait , Bush showed us how it 's done in Saudi Arabia ... just ' being there ' .

The police surveillance team had spotted their target : a 12 - year - old boy with freckles and ginger hair .
He was known to police for nuisance behaviour .
They watched as he walked along a path with friends in the distance , before disappearing down a side street .
When the four boys emerged from the estate ’s maze of alleyways , the patrol car was waiting .
“ Is this that operation , sir ? ” said one boy .
“ I do n’t want to be on camera . ”
He already was .
Operation Leopard is the latest weapon in the fight against antisocial behaviour to receive government backing .
Pioneered by officers in Essex policing difficult estates , it deploys forward intelligence teams ( FITs ) – units trained to gather evidence at foxhunts , protests and football matches – in areas suffering from crime .
FIT officers target a hit list of individuals who are “ known to police ” , and subject them to repeated surveillance .
Last week the Guardian was given unprecedented access to the latest operation on the Five Links estate in Laindon , near Basildon .
For civil rights groups , the operation is an Orwellian technique that persecutes individuals who have committed no crime .
But for police , the “ in your face ” approach works and , unlike covert surveillance , it requires no special authorisation .
Essex police claim there has been a “ 100 % ” drop in crime on target estates during recent operations .
Their surveys indicate the so - called “ harass a youth ” strategy is popular in the community .
Before the previous Operation Leopard , 27.8 % of residents on the estate told police they had recently witnessed crime or antisocial behaviour .
In the weeks after the operation , that dropped to 8.5 % .
Home Office support for the tactic comes as confidence in asbos once the government ’s flagship tool for combating antisocial behaviour has disintegrated .
Earlier this month the government released figures to show use of the orders had dropped by 34 % .
In a speech this month widely received as marking the decline of the asbo , the home secretary , Jacqui Smith , singled out the Essex force ’s initiative for praise .
“ Operation Leopard is exactly the sort of intensive policing that can bring persistent offenders to their senses , ” she said .
“ It creates an environment where those responsible for antisocial behaviour have no room for manoeuvre and nowhere to hide , where the tables are turned on offenders so that those who harass our communities are themselves harried and harassed . ”
Essex police , who have scheduled 12 more operations this year , have since been approached by police forces across Britain for information on their techniques .
Troublemakers
Last week ’s three - day operation began with officers hunched over laminated mugshots of 14 “ targets ” on the Five Links estate .
Sergeant Simon Mathias , in charge of neighbourhood policing , briefed two community support officers , two special constables and a team of FIT officers on the individuals he had identified as troublemakers .
All were male , and most were under 18 .
One was just 11 .
Between them they had convictions for robbery , battery , criminal damage and carrying weapons .
Mathias explained that officers would work in shifts , roaming the estate in search of the targets .
Occasionally , he said , they should visit the targets ’ homes .
Officers were instructed to film “ any individuals ” seen associating with them .
All footage would be kept for “ evidence and intelligence ” purposes .
“ We ’re going to be more proactive , more intrusive , ” said Mathias .
“ But it ’s going to all be in the public domain , and all in the interests of preventing crime and antisocial behaviour . ”
Nicknamed Alcatraz because of its fortress - like appearance , the Five Links estate has high levels of crime .
It is also notoriously hard to police when confronted , suspects easily melt into a web of backstreets that police call “ the rat run ” .
During the first afternoon , two youths were reported on the roof of a school and , after a chase , were caught .
They were in a group filmed earlier in the day for associating with a target .
“ It shows that we ’re stopping the right people , ” said Mathias .
Although officers claimed targets could choose not to be filmed , none of those stopped in the presence of the Guardian around 15 suspects and associates were given that choice .
“ It winds me up .
I ca n’t go nowhere without them following me , ” said Michael , 18 , after what he said was his fourth stop .
“ I got back from work and as soon as I got out the van they were just taking photos of me straight away zooming in on all the patterns I ’ve got in my hair . ”
Michael ’s mother complained to police that he was being harassed .
“ You can understand the parents , ” an FIT officer remarked later .
“ But , you know : tough .
You wo n’t control them we will . ”
By the third day the group actively began to evade police .
They spent time indoors , playing computer games , or ventured off the estate on to a nearby patch of grass to play football .
Some lifted their hoods every time they saw a patrol car .
Lee , 19 , said he had been stigmatised .
“ I admit I was a little shit back in the past , but who ain’t ? ” he said .
“ I ’ve grown up now I ’m chilled these days .
The old bill do n’t let us move on .
They keep on classing us as criminals . ”
For civil rights groups , which have complained about Operation Leopard , this is precisely the problem .
Some activists have launched a counterattack , subjecting FIT officers to surveillance .
Turning their own cameras on FIT , activists have started posting officers ’ names , faces and badge numbers online .
Adversarial
Back at the station , the officers logged on to one of the websites , Fitwatch , and vented their frustration at “ revenge attacks ” .
One said being filmed felt “ unnerving ” .
During patrols the adversarial nature of what one FIT officer called “ the hunt ” was on show .
Some officers developed derogatory nicknames for the teenagers they were stopping .
But when talking to their teenage targets , the officers strove to build a rapport .
They joked about the situation , and told the teenagers to rest assured they had done “ nothing wrong ” .
Sergeant Gavin Brook , who helped devise Operation Leopard in January , was the only FIT officer who agreed to be named .
He acknowledged there were civil liberty implications , but added : “ You have to weigh up causing a bit of annoyance to 12 or 14 youths , against the 2,000 or 3,000 residents whose lives have been improved . ”
Many Five Links residents backed Brook ’s argument , saying any initiative that put large numbers of police on the street would deter nuisance behaviour .
But others , particularly long - time residents , were sceptical about it working when the cameras were off , or felt the method would make teenagers more hostile .
Pictured : Superstar matador gets gored by TWO angry bulls
Matador Jose Tomas had a lucky escape yesterday when he was gored not once , but TWICE during a bullfight in Madrid .
The 32 - year - old , who is widely considered one of the best bullfighters of all time , was competing at the Las Ventas bullring in the Spanish capital when he sustained his injuries .
Tomas , who received medical treatment at the scene , sustained one groin injury that looked exceptionally painful .
Ouch : Matador Jose Tomas is gored in a sensitive spot by the second bull
Just two weeks ago , Tomas survived another goring during a bullfight at the ' El Coso de los Califas ' ring in Cordoba .
Following that incident , veteran critic Juan Belmonte of Canal Sur television in Seville said that success in bullfighting is a question of having a unique style , a personal flair that breaks the mould that usually makes one matador virtually indistinguishable from the next - and in this Tomas excels .

Tomas gets up very close to the bull - both before luring it into a charge and as it rumbles by - and looks relaxed and natural in his bravado , showing utter disregard for all the danger , Belmonte said .
He added , ' You realise that the guy out there gives the impression that he does not care if he dies right then . '
Tomas left bullfighting behind in 2002 , at the peak of his career , without saying why , and returned to the sport a year ago .
He told the newspaper El Pais in May last year that he was coming back because ' living without bullfighting is not living ' .
Awkward situation , above .
But Tomas is known for his fearlessness .

Just doing someone a favor .
I go to the website .
I ’ve used it before , so I figure I ’ll log in to my account .

Uh oh .
W0500 Sorry you 're having trouble .

This does not bode well .
I ’m having trouble ?

And if the trouble is on my end , what good will trying again later do ?
Are they suggesting that I am having brain issues which will resolve themselves in a few hours ?
OK , assume this is just their eccentric way of saying “ login failed ” .
I have a dim recollection of not being able to use one of my regular passwords because they do n’t allow special characters in their passwords ( why is it always institutions which handle large sums of money that have poor password policies ? )
Email customer service , and meanwhile , click the “ retrieve password ” link .
Notice while emailing customer service the lengthy backlog of previous Western Union customer service mail from the last time I tried to wire money through them .
Oh dear , I must have blocked those memories .
OK , well , chin up and keep trying .
While waiting for customer service , hit the “ forgot password ” link .
Go through the first step , email address , date of birth … that ’s odd .
This is probably the first site I ’ve ever seen where the “ Date of Birth ” field is a password - style field .
Presumably so no potential identity thieves peering over my shoulder witness that top - secret information , and I have to go through all the hassle of changing my birth date to something new .
Anyway , moving on , ah , the Security Question .
OK , what ’s it going to be – good ole ’ mother ’s maiden name ?

I spoke to a manager , re-started the transaction .
Gave them all my information over again , then sat on hold for another ten minutes or so .
Finally , after a total of 50 minutes on the phone , they informed me that my transaction had been rejected by the ineffable machines which sometimes grant , and sometimes deny , and no one can say why … for security reasons .

Like many people , I participated in the Google Android contest this spring , and like most of them , I did n’t win , but I did enjoy working with the platform , and am very excited about the idea of an open source mobile platform that ’s relatively powerful .
From the outset , due to the lack of actual source code for a lot of the system , there have been “ doubters ” about what Google is really up to .
I ’m not one of them , and am largely ok with their reasons for holding back : I buy their reasoning that the long term benefits of a strong , properly QA ’ed launch probably outweigh the possibility of failure that might come from the press and the public at large that does n’t care much about software freedom seeing phones come out with half - baked , early implementations .
I think most of us working with Android were ok with that strategy , and the ones who were n’t self - selected out of the platform , most likely .
However , lately Google has made something of a mess of their communications regarding Android .
The problem stems from the fact that they gave an updated version of the SDK only to the winners of the competition , which for a lot of people felt like a bit of a slap in the face : they helped popularize the platform by participating in the contest and writing applications for it , and in return got excluded from the upgrade path .
Personally , it ’s not really any skin off my nose , as I ’m sanguine about the Hecl port proceeding apace when the new SDK is public , but I can see that if you were , say , a company porting your app to the platform and now are left behind the competition winners , you might be a bit irritated .
The biggest mistake they ’ve made though , is a big lack of communication regarding this business .
As I said , I do n’t really have that much skin in the game , and if they explained in a convincing way why they needed to do things that way , they would go a long ways to allaying the frustrations felt by many .
I ’m not much of a believer in conspiracy theories and plots , especially where companies are concerned .
Inept bumbling is a far more likely explanation in most cases , including this one .
What is odd , though , is that Google has a lot of people who “ get it ” .
I met Dan Morrill at the Munich Android event , and he definitely gets it .
He writes about his frustrations as a developer advocate and all the crazy things people say .
Well , one way to reduce the number of batty internet theories ( eliminating them is clearly impossible due to the alien mind control rays ) is to consistently communicate quality information about what ’s really going on , something that has been lacking with regards to the SDK question .
Here ’s another Google employee who understands this need to communicate , and apparently does so despite being worried about being “ slapped for talking publicy about all this ” :
http://groups.google.com/group/android-developers/msg/244edfad99870c63
But the root of the problem is certainly not licensing but that there has n’t
been a new public SDK release
since M5 , while at the same time a small group of people received updated
versions privately .
I really do n’t know precisely why this happened ; but I ’m sure it has more to
do with logistics and reducing
the burden of support while we shift priorities ( to shipping real devices )
rather than politics or any will of our
part to “ hurt the community ” ( come one guys , we are not that stupid … !)
While others in the team may disagree , I think it was very very unfortunate ;
some of us are trying to
prepare a new SDK release , but it ’s a lot harder than I can comment on here ,
so do n’t hold your breath
because it might not happen that soon .
This explains things in part , but still leaves us in the dark , and leaves me with the feeling that someone in power , somewhere at Google , despite his or her clued in colleagues , really does n’t get it with regards to open source .
I ’m still unconcerned about the Android source code : I think we ’ll see it , but to be a true open source project , Android will need an open community as well , not one where decisions are taken exclusively at Google , and not even communicated to the development community at large .
All in all , this mistake is more molehill than mountain , but however you look at it , in terms of open source , it is a step backwards .
" You ca n't use your religious beliefs to get away with harming a child , " the mother of two who now lives in Georgia told the paper .
" This is so much bigger than myself .
This is about not allowing the cover of religion to permit physical abuse in a church , and particularly to a child . "
On the day of Saddam Hussein ’s capture , last December , the left - leaning political weekly The Nation celebrated its hundred - and - thirty - eighth birthday .
It was a Sunday night , and the weather was dreadful — forbiddingly cold and wet , heavy snow giving way to sleet — but three hundred people could not be deterred from dropping five hundred dollars a plate for roast chicken amid the marble - and - velvet splendor of the Metropolitan Club , on Fifth Avenue .
Jean Stein , a veteran of the liberal party circuit and the mother of Katrina vanden Heuvel , The Nation ’s editor , was there , as were E. L. Doctorow , John Waters , Charlie Rose , and even John McEnroe .
Robert Byrd , the senior senator from West Virginia , was an honored guest ; Amtrak had been advised of his itinerary , and , despite service delays all weekend , the train got him there on time .
Joseph Wilson , the former Ambassador to Gabon , riding a wave of liberal good will since the politically motivated outing of his wife , the C.I.A. operative Valerie Plame , attended as well , by special invitation .
Byrd spoke first , and he delivered a generous helping of full - throated Southern oratory .
Yes , it was good to see Saddam gone , Byrd said , but he was ever more convinced , what with a “ swashbuckling , ‘ High Noon ’ ” kind of President in office , that Iraq was the wrong war at the wrong time .
“ Thank God for courageous institutions like this one , ” he said , “ which are willing to stand up to the tide of popular convention . ”
He recited the closing lines of Tennyson ’s “ Ulysses , ” and then , finishing up , invoked “ the spirit of Longfellow . ” Standing ovation .
Toward the dessert ( chocolate torte ) portion of the evening , Uma Thurman rose to introduce a special guest : Aaron McGruder , the creator of the popular and subversive comic strip “ The Boondocks , ” who , as it happens , had travelled farther than anyone else to be there , all the way from Los Angeles .
McGruder , one of only a few prominent African - American cartoonists , had been making waves in all the right ways , poking conspicuous fun at Trent Lott , the N.R.A. , the war effort .
An exhibition of his comic strips — characters with Afros and dreadlocks drawn in a style borrowing heavily from Japanese manga , __with accentuated __foreheads and eyes — was on display in the Metropolitan Club ’s Great Hall .
It seemed to be , as a Nation contributor said later , “ his coronation as our kind of guy . ”
But what McGruder saw when he looked around at his approving audience was this : a lot of old , white faces .
What followed was not quite a coronation .
McGruder , who rarely prepares notes or speeches for events like this , began by thanking Thurman , “ the most ass - kicking woman in America . ”
Then he lowered the boom .
He was a twenty - nine - year - old black man , he said , who got invited to such functions all the time , so you could imagine how bored he was .
He proceeded to ramble , at considerable length , and in a tone , as one listener put it , of “ militant cynicism , ” with a recurring theme : that the folks in the room ( “ courageous ” ?
Please ) were a sorry lot .
He told the guests that he ’d called Condoleezza Rice , the national - security adviser , a mass murderer to her face ; what had they ever done ?
( The Rice exchange occurred in 2002 , at the N.A.A.C.P. Image Awards , where McGruder was given the Chairman ’s Award ; Rice requested that he write her into his strip . )
He recounted a lunch meeting with Fidel Castro .
( He had been invited to Cuba by the California congresswoman Barbara Lee , who is one of the few politicians McGruder has praised in “ The Boondocks . ” )
He said that noble failure was not acceptable .
But the last straw came when he “ dropped the N - word , ” as one amused observer recalled .
He said — bragged , even — that he ’d voted for Nader in 2000 .
At that point , according to Hamilton Fish , the host of the party , “ it got interactive . ”
Eric Alterman , a columnist for The Nation , was sitting in the back of the room , next to Joe Wilson , the Ambassador .
He shouted out , “ Thanks for Bush ! ” Exactly what happened next is unclear .
Alterman recalls that McGruder responded by grabbing his crotch and saying , “ Try these nuts . ” Jack Newfield , the longtime Village Voice writer , says that McGruder simply dared Alterman to remove him from the podium .
When asked about this incident later , McGruder said , “ I ai n’t no punk .
I ai n’t gonna let someone shout and not go back at him . ”
Alterman walked out .
“ I turned to Joe and said , ‘ I ca n’t listen to this crap anymore , ’ ” he remembers .
“ I went out into the Metropolitan Club lobby — it ’s a nice lobby — and I worked on my manuscript . ”
Newfield joined in the heckling , as did Stephen Cohen , a historian and the husband of Katrina vanden Heuvel .
“ It was like watching LeRoi Jones try to Mau - Mau a guilty white liberal in the sixties , ” Newfield says .
“ It was out of a time warp .
Who is he to insult people who have been putting their careers and lives on the line for equal rights since before he was born ? ”
By the time McGruder had finished , and a tipsy Joe Wilson took the microphone to deliver his New Year ’s Resolutions , perhaps half the guests had excused themselves to join Alterman in the lobby .
A Nation contributor estimated that McGruder had offended eighty per cent of the audience .
“ Some people still have n’t recovered , ” he said , sounding thrilled .
“ At a certain point , I just got the uncomfortable feeling that this was a bunch of people who were feeling a little too good about themselves , ” McGruder said afterward .
“ These are the big , rich white leftists who are going to carry the fight to George Bush , and the best they can do is blame Nader ? ”
He went on , laughing a little , “ I was not the right guest for that event .
I ’ll be the first one to say that .
It was one of those reminders that , yeah , I ’m not this political leader that people are looking for . ”
As a talented young black man who is outspoken in his political convictions , McGruder has grown accustomed to inordinately high expectations .
The Green Party called him last year , asking if he might like to run for President .
He had to point out that he was n’t old enough .
“ I want to do stuff that has a moral center — stuff that I can be proud of , ” he continued .
“ But I ’m not trying to be that guy , the political voice of young black America , because then you have to sort of be a responsible grownup , for lack of a better word .
And it ’s like — you know , Flip Wilson said this , he said , ‘ I reserve the right to be a nigger . ’
And I absolutely do , at all times . ”
Huey Freeman , the hero of “ The Boondocks ” and McGruder ’s supposed alter ego , has not cracked a smile in five years of syndication .
From the day he and his little brother , Riley , moved out of Chicago ’s South Side to live comfortably with their granddad in the suburbs — the boondocks —
Huey , a practicing member of the “ church of self - righteousness , ” has been treating readers of the funnies page to an unhealthy dose of indignation , paranoia , and hatred .
He is perhaps ten years old , in that ageless cartoon way , with an Afro , a high forehead , perpetually knitted brows , and an unnatural familiarity with the precepts of socialist black nationalism .
He has roughly equal contempt for Dick Cheney , Cuba Gooding , Jr. , and Santa Claus .
“ Since when are millions of Americans ready to wake up to the rantings of an angry black kid ? ”
Huey ’s best friend , Caesar , a dreadlocked , droopy - eyed transplant from Brooklyn , once asked him , in an early installment of the strip .
The joke was obvious and boastful ; by then “ The Boondocks ” was appearing more or less daily in some two hundred and thirty newspapers ( it is now in three hundred ) , including the Los Angeles Times , the Washington Post , and the Chicago Tribune .
More or less daily because editors tended to suspend Huey and company from their pages on occasions when the intentions of the strip ’s author — to provide “ a daily foot in the ass of The Man ” — were achieved a little too vividly .
( A dozen editors had already expelled the Freeman family for good ; still others had relocated McGruder to the op - ed page . )
The Freeman trio — Huey , Riley ( a wanna - be thug ) , and Granddad ( a cantankerous skeptic and resigned pragmatist ) — represent “ three different facets of the sort of angry - black - man archetype , ” according to McGruder .
He recently published an anthology of the strip ’s first few years , titled “ A Right to Be Hostile . ”
More angry books are on the way .
“ Profits of Rage ” is the working title of one , a text - only manifesto fashioned after the works of Michael Moore and Al Franken .
“ Huey ’s Hate Book , ” a planned coffee - table volume , is another .
Like the Freeman brothers , McGruder was born on the South Side of Chicago , though he did n’t stay there long .
The McGruders — Aaron , his parents , and an older brother , Dedric , who is now a part - time political cartoonist — shuffled around some before settling , when Aaron was six , in the middle - class suburb of Columbia , Maryland .
( Aaron ’s father works for the National Transportation Safety Board . )
Columbia is in some ways the inspiration for Woodcrest , the fictional home of the “ Boondocks ” characters .
It was a planned community — envisioned as a sort of integrationist , post - civil - rights utopia — developed by the Rouse Company in the mid-nineteen - sixties , and featuring an official town “ Tree of Life , ” and streets and neighborhoods with names like Hobbit ’s Glen and Morning Walk and Elfstone Way .
( Huey and Riley live on Timid Deer Lane , one block over from Bashful Beaver . )
McGruder ’s was a fairly typical , well - adjusted eighties childhood , and he had typical interests : “ Star Wars , ” Charlie Brown , kung fu .
He went to a Jesuit school — “ a very strict , very , very white Jesuit school ” — outside Columbia from seventh through ninth grade .
“ Those were the most oppressive years of my life , ” he told me .
( Huey and Riley , not coincidentally , attend J. Edgar Hoover Elementary . )
They were also the years in which he was exposed to his greatest , and perhaps most surprising , comedic influence .
“ When I was in seventh grade , I discovered Monty Python , ” he said .
“ That shit still kills me .
I try to get my friends to watch that and they just ca n’t get it .
‘ No , no , no , it ’s funny — the lumberjack ! ’
‘ Life of Brian ’ is , to me , the most brilliant piece of satire ever — it ’s just brilliant .
He ’s trying to write ‘ Romans go home ’ in Latin and he ca n’t do the Latin right . ”
McGruder shook his head .
“ A lot of black people ai n’t up on Monty Python like they should be . ”
In tenth grade , he transferred to public school and began , for the first time , really , to hang out with other black people .
He listened to a lot of hip - hop music .
It was the era of politically conscious rap : Public Enemy , KRS - One ( Knowledge Reigns Supreme Over Nearly Everyone ) , X - Clan .
“ All that sort of radical , pro-black - nationalist type of music — it was just a fad , but at fifteen and sixteen you ’re very impressionable , ” he told me .
“ It was one of the few times , I think , in black history when as a young person you could be cool and intellectual at the same time . ”
( McGruder , who is proud to call himself a nerd , no longer thinks of himself as cool .
“ Most cool niggas I know are broke , ” he said . )
The first person ever to publish “ The Boondocks ” was the disgraced New York Times fabulist Jayson Blair , who was then editing The Diamondback , the campus paper at the University of Maryland , where McGruder majored in African - American studies .
“ We were n’t friends , but he seemed like the brother who had figured out the system , ” McGruder recalls of Blair .
“ It was like , ‘ You do n’t seem one hundred per cent down , but you ’re definitely not a Tom .
Somehow you ’re making it work . ’ ” That was the end of 1996 ; less than two years later , having found an audience among the largely white Maryland readership , McGruder signed a deal with the Universal Press Syndicate , the publisher of Garry Trudeau ’s “ Doonesbury , ” and in April of 1999 “ The Boondocks ” began appearing in a hundred and sixty papers — one of the biggest launches in the history of comics .
Even after the Metropolitan Club melee , McGruder has continued to receive and accept invitations to deliver lectures — at banquets , on college campuses , in corporate boardrooms .
The Sony Music Group flew him to New York in February for one such talk , and he agreed to meet me for dinner afterward .
He arrived at the restaurant , a small , country - style spot near Gramercy Park , wearing a James Brown T - shirt , jeans , and sneakers .
He is not , in person , imposing or striking or noticeably angry — not the kind of guy you ’d expect to be challenging anyone to a fight .
He is short , with soft features , a slight goatee , and the beginnings of an Afro.
Unlike Huey , he smiles — sheepishly and often .
“ Somebody has to sort of translate the drums for white folks , and occasionally they call me to try to do it , ” McGruder explained .
It was a good hustle , the lecture circuit , he said .
In the course of three hours — McGruder tends to answer each question with a fifteen - minute monologue — he returned repeatedly to this familiar trope of cynical entrepreneurialism .
People like Ann Coulter and Bill O’Reilly , he said , were hustlers .
“ It ’s like , ‘ The more ridiculous shit I say that ’s hurtful and hateful and racist , the more you stupid rednecks will buy books , ’ ” he said , in a deep , slightly nasal baritone .
“ I do n’t even get mad at them , ’ cause I get what it is .
I ’m in the same game . ”
Larry Elder , an African - American radio host and a frequent McGruder critic , was a hustler , too : “ He decided to be the black guy that makes money by saying the things that white people want black people to say . ”
( Elder , in a recent op - ed column , suggested that an award for the “ Dumbest , Most Vulgar , Most Offensive Things Uttered by Black Public Figures ” be dubbed the McGruder . )
“ I ’m always on the fence : do I want to be one of those guys ? ” McGruder said .
“ I love Michael Moore ” — Moore wrote the foreword to “ A Right to Be Hostile , ” praising McGruder ’s “ bodacious wit ” — “ and I see what he does .
He ’s got the game down , and that ’s not a bad thing .
People act like you ca n’t be a left - winger and be rich at the same time , like that ’s some type of hypocrisy .
It ’s not hypocrisy .
You gotta get paid .
This is n’t the days of the civil - rights era , where you can change the world with a picket sign .
You gotta get your money up . ”
I got a disturbing email today on Flo 's mailing list ( of Notepad2 fame ) .
Florian Balmer is the author of the most excellent Notepad2 .
This is a great " it just works " editor .
It 's Notepad , but goes one better , I like to say .
I 've promoted it on my Tools List and in countless talks .
Notepad2 has been developed over ten years and is in active , ongoing development .
Florian has posted most recently about his adventures in Unicode .
Flo was surfing and discovered http://www.notepad3.org.
This is uncool for a number of concrete reasons .
UPDATE / CORRECTION : I screwed up the licensing so my only complaints to the author of Notepad3 is that the name makes for a tacky fork and that the changes appear to be not significant in their scope .
I apologize .
Notepad3 is a fork of a older version of Notepad2 , specifically the GPL'ed Notepad2 1.0.12 rather than the BSD Licensed Notepad2 2.1.19 .
The GPL'ed Notepad2 was released on June 25th , 2004 .
The BSD licensed version was released on April 7th , 2007 .
See , it turns out Netiquette CAN be subtle !
The distributor of Notepad3 did not include Florian 's license .
UPDATE / CORRECTION :
The license still is intact in the .c source code files , just not in the main license .
txt .
The full copy of the original Notepad2 license. txt also appears in Notepad3's source zip in c165/license.txt .
Notepad2 is distributed with this license ( I snipped the copyright all caps at the end for brevity ) as its main license.
txt .
Florian 's name does n't appear anywhere within the Notepad3 root license.
txt , which appears to be an aggregate of a number of licenses of the sub-components .
UPDATE / CORRECTION : Flo 's website is referenced in the license .
txt 's header .
The Notepad3 " creator " did n't make any attempts to include his changes in Notepad2 or give Florian a heads - up .
Now , these next reasons are my own opinions , and possibly subtle .
You tell me .
These are my opinions .
Mildly Tacky :
They made up a new name and registered a new domain for the project .
The new source can be only by found by digging around the main site .
Can you find it ?
UPDATE / CORRECTION : I think the source should be linked directly to from the main page .
Rather , it 's under download / src using the navigation on the left of their site .
They made up a new name and registered a new domain for the project .
The new source can be only by found by digging around the main site .
Tacky :
The new entity , Notepad3 , arguably does n't contain substantive improvements , certainly not enough to be called an entirely new version , and definitely not Notepad3 .
You can see the sum total of the changed lines on Flo 's post .
The new entity , Notepad3 , arguably does n't contain substantive improvements , certainly not enough to be called an entirely new version , and definitely not Notepad3 .
You can see the sum total of the changed lines on Flo 's post .
Rather Tacky :
They took the time to put the new entity has been put up on Softpedia and promote it without a single reference to Florian or Notepad2 .
It 's not that Florian does n't appreciate improvements .
He has put a number of modified versions his side , including a very minor update by Wesner Moise and I .
If he wanted to incorporate these changes into the mainline he could easily .
I included a source diff for him , but most importantly I did n't make it look like his work was mine !
Modified Versions of Notepad2
When people do Open Source work , one of the things that is almost universal is the natural human need for appreciation .
For attribution .
One overarching intent of the whole Creative Commons with Attribution license and most Open Source Licenses is " just do n't remove the part that says * I did this ! * "
Flo says it well , albeit with some understandable passion :
Nonetheless , the author has chosen the name " Notepad3 " .
Compared with the original Notepad , Notepad2 represents an evolution with new features .
" Notepad3 " implies the same , but with even less features , without any new development .
Seems that the play on words is used to fool users into believing that " Notepad3 " is something more advanced .
The popularity of Notepad2 is being taken advantage of to attract some attention ―
I have no idea what else might be the motivation of the author .
The author justifies the publication of " Notepad3 " with the added installation and documentation ( which is actually my documentation , and has always been there ) .
Innovation equals zero .
This causes confusion about the different versions available , and the reputation of my software is harmed when associated with that kind of sloppy , offending descendants ( and , it makes me think how indiscriminate some well - known software sites are concerning additions to their repositories ) .
I have no problem with new versions of my software being released , even with minor changes ― my licensing conditions are fully met .
The problem here is that the author made minor changes to the code and branded it in a very disingenuous and deceiving manner .
Perhaps this is just a faux pas , a minor misunderstanding .
However , I would encourage Readers who are interested in getting into Open Source to think about these issues when getting involved in projects .
My Own Experiences in Open Source
I 've had a lot of great experiences and one speed bump .
WatirMaker
When I wrote WatirMaker and released the source , I had written it from scratch .
Each time it got forked or written again or modified , the folks who did it let me know !
They asked for help !
I offered help !
It was a lovefest - the kind of lovefest that I think Open Source should be .
The email conversations usually went like this :
Dude , heads up , I want to do _____ Sweet !
Rock on , let me know if you want help with ____ or if / when / how we can put _____ back into the source .
Wanna join the project !
Sweet !
Dude !
Rock on !
Yay !
< Hugs . >
And the results were cool .
Notice how everyone is genial , chatting , and attributing ?
Even in Richard 's WatinRecorder post , by now likely a complete re-write of my stuff , was thoughtful enough to thank a bunch of folks .
DasBlog
DasBlog , now the work of dozens , originally came from Clemens Vasters , who originally got it from Chris Anderson 's BlogX had a similar issue happen when a gentleman forked our Source Code and created an entirely different project out of it with an all new name .
This happened two years ago and he 's since changed / refactored the project pretty substantially , but it still felt crappy at the time and the team was rightfully torqued .
At the time , all that had been done was a recompile under VS2005 and a check - in as a new project with a new name .
Justice Gray blogged about it soon after :
Saying that " in the long term , Think Jot will move away from the original dasBlog source code " , implies that all you 've done is make some minor project ports , throw in a new DatePicker and call this your own project .
For sure , it 's probably legally fine given the terms of the open - source license , but it leaves a bad taste in my mouth .
How would you feel if you worked on something for a long time and then someone just took all the work you did , rebranding it and called it their own ?
I mean , c'mon !
Fortunately the author posted about this later and admitted this most important point :
" My biggest mistake has been that I never talked to the dasBlog team previously about this .
I admit it , and apologize . "
And I give him full credit for that simple admission .
Folks that copy / fork are rarely evil or malicious .
We 're all just trying to move the ball forward , and perhaps that 's the same in the case of Notepad3 .
However , that does n't change the fact that talking to folks up front can make all the difference .
Unfortunately , at this point , this issue has soured Florian considerably :
I have been working on Notepad2 over more than 10 years , altogether .
The above hacks may have been done in a few minutes .
There have been similar cases in the past , already , but this one really beats everything .
I 'm not sure if I 'm going to release any more open source versions of Notepad2 , in the future .
Ain't fun like that .
Let 's encourage Florian to keep up the great work and as we go about our lives as members of the Open Source community , let 's remember to appreciate all the hard work that folks put into their various projects and that just because Copy / Paste is easy does n't make it right .
My Tips ?
When in Doubt ...
If you 're doing Open Source and you 're unclear about Netiquette , then :
Just ask .
Ask someone working on a project how they do it .
Err on the side of attribution .
You can't attribute or thank too many people , especially if you 've copy / pasted something .
Reach Out . Email the authors .
Talk to people , join mailing lists and for goodness sake , avoid working in a vacuum .
I still get emails about GlucoPilot , a shareware app I wrote almost 8 years ago .
If I had the rights to the source , I 'd give to the world .
( Still working on that , actually )
Appreciate your peers and everyone that contributes to the community .
Jeffrey Blankenburg has a clever idea , declaring July 3rd , " Contribupendance Day , " while slightly ethnocentric ;) it 's a great idea where Jeff is going to tell 5 people in his peer group how much he appreciates what they do and how they contribute by writing compliments and recommendations on their LinkedIn and Plaxo or Facebook pages .
I think I 'll do the same !
What do you think ?
Whether by calculation or coincidence , Hillary Clinton and Republicans who have attacked Barack Obama for elitism have struck a chord in a long - standing symphony of racial codes .
It is a rebuke that gets magnified by historic beliefs about what blacks are and what they have no right to be .
Clinton is no racist , and Obama has made some real missteps , including his remark last week that “ bitter ” small - town Americans facing economic hardship and government indifference “ cling to guns or religion or antipathy to people who are n’t like them . ”
Perhaps he was being more sociological than political , and more sympathetic than condescending .
But when his opponents branded him an elitist and an outsider , his race made it easier to drive a wedge between him and the white , rural voters he has courted .
As an African American , he was supposedly looking down from a place he did n’t belong and looking in from a distance he could not cross .
This could not happen as dramatically were it not for embedded racial attitudes .
“ Elitist ” is another word for “ arrogant , ” which is another word for “ uppity , ” that old calumny applied to blacks who stood up for themselves .
At the bottom of the American psyche , race is still about power , and blacks who move up risk triggering discomfort among some whites .
I ’ve met black men who , when stopped by white cops at night , think the best protection is to act dumb and deferential .

Furthermore , casting Obama as “ out of touch ” plays harmoniously with the traditional notion of blacks as “ others ” at the edge of the mainstream , separate from the whole .
Despite his ability to articulate the frustration and yearning of broad segments of Americans , his “ otherness ” has been highlighted effectively by right - wingers who harp on his Kenyan father and spread false rumors that he ’s a clandestine Muslim .
In a country so changed that a biracial man who is considered black has a shot at the presidency , the subterranean biases are much less discernible now than when the Rev. Martin Luther King Jr. was assassinated .
They are subtle , unacknowledged and unacceptable in polite company .
But they lurk below , lending resonance to the criticisms of Obama .
Black professionals know the double standard .
They are often labeled negatively for traits deemed positive in whites :
A white is assertive , a black is aggressive ; a white is resolute , a black is pushy ; a white is candid , a black is abrasive ; a white is independent , a black is not a team player .
Prejudice is a shape shifter , adapting to acceptable forms .
So although Obama ’s brilliance defies the stubborn stereotype of African Americans as unintelligent , there is a companion to that image -- doubts about blacks ’ true capabilities -- that may heighten concerns about his inexperience .
Through the racial lens , a defect can be enlarged into a disability .
He is “ not ready , ” a phrase employed often when blacks are up for promotion .
When Clinton mocked Obama for the supposed emptiness of his eloquence , the chiding had a faint historical echo from Thomas Jefferson ’s musings in “ Notes on the State of Virginia ” that “ in music they are more generally gifted than the whites with accurate ears for tune and time , ” but “ one could scarcely be found capable of tracing and comprehending the investigations of Euclid . ”

This slander that blacks had more show than substance was handed down through later generations as a body - mind dichotomy , with physical and mental prowess as opposites .
Overt “ compliments ” -- they ’ve got rhythm , they can dance , they can jump -- were paired with the silent assumption of inferior intellect .
Clinton surely had no racial intent , but none is needed for a racial impact .
In a society long steeped in stereotypes , such comments reverberate .
The incessant loop of the Rev. Jeremiah Wright Jr. cursing America and repeating old conspiracy theories has revived fears of black anger among whites whose threshold of tolerance for such rage has always been low .
No matter that Obama seems anything but angry .
A few sentences from his pastor are enough to incite such anxieties .
The nation is testing how its racial attitudes have evolved .
As the campaign continues , we are likely to be both pleased and disappointed with ourselves .
While some organizations are focusing on recruiting new and replacement workers , many others are urging and enticing older workers to stay longer .
This is creating a new form of discrimination called the “ gray ceiling . ”
Unlike the more common cases involving discrimination such as gender , age , and sexual preference , the gray ceiling is n’t necessarilty protecting a protected class .
The implications for ignoring the gray ceiling wo n’t likely result in an employee filing a discrimination claim .
But this is n’t necessarily a time to celebrate .
The consequences may be much worse !
Generation X , the former youngest generation in the workplace , are now the middle children at work .
They ’ve been patiently – or at least reluctantly - waiting for a boomer to get out of the way so they can finally move up the career ladder .
But those aging , baby boomers just do n’t seem to want to move on with their lives .
Whether it ’s their workaholic nature or the need for money , they are not leaving the workplace as quickly as anticipated .
While that might generate a sigh of relief for many executives and business owners , I ’ll suggest you take a deep breath and ….. ponder this .
The most highly skilled Generation X workers are no longer waiting around .
They are leaving the workforce in record numbers .
Their skill sets make them hot property .
Their age ( roughly late 20s to early 40s ) offers another organization immediate talent and future capacity .
This exodus of Gen X skilled workers is not only the fault of gray - haired boomers staying longer .
It ’s also the result of the newest generation , the Millennials , arriving on the scene .
Bright , ambitious , collaborative and technically advanced , this youngest cohort is catching the eye of the workplace elders and the wrath of the Xers .
In fact , it ’s not the Boomers who are complaining the most of these “ irritating rug rats . ”
It ’s the Xers !
What is beginning to happen in many workplaces is that the Millennials are leapfrogging the Xers into lead roles and projects .
Even more insulting , Millennials are like heat seeking missiles for knowledge .
Why waste no time going to his or her Gen X boss when they have a question .
They just go straight to the best source by sending an email or knocking on the door of the President .
This group is used to quick access to information .
Why go to the library and borrow the book when you can " google " just about anything ?
Playing politics to them is just like playing games .
You outmaneuver your opponents to get to the next level .
Gen Xers are just another level on the way to the top and these game - playing Millennials are smart and savvy .
The Xers , on the other hand , are restless and are n’t taking this lying down .
Remember these kids grew up with latch - keys and learned to fend for themselves .
Ignore them and they ’ll go away without anyone really noticing .
But when the boomers finally do decide to call it a career , a gaping talent hole will be discovered by those businesses who do n't consider the consequences and do n’t plan ahead .
Succession used to be so much easier !
What ’s a business to do ?
1 . First things first .
Assess the demography of your workforce today .
How many older workers are just biding time until retirement ?
How soon will be they leaving ?
Who is in line to replace them ?
How many younger workers are at risk to be picked off by a competitor ?
2 . What is the capability of the younger workers ?
Will they be prepared to move up into management and leadership position when the time comes ?
What additional training will they need ?
3 . How prepared are your managers to deal with the wants and demands of four generations working side - by - side ?
How prepared is your organization to squelch the workplace warfare between the Geeks , Geezers and other generations ?
What can you do to slow the boomer brain drain , retain the Gen Xers and recruit the Millennials all at the same time ?
Today , EFF Senior Staff Attorney Kevin Bankston was invited to guest - blog at The Hill.com 's Congress Blog on EFF 's plans in the wake of the recent surveillance law overhaul :
Our long war against warrantless wiretapping has only just begun , and we will not stop until we get that legal ruling we ’ve been fighting for .
Wednesday we only lost a battle , not the war , and EFF ’s struggle to hold the White House and the telecoms accountable for their lawbreaking will continue on multiple fronts — starting with a constitutional challenge to the immunity provisions ...
While duking it out over immunity in the courts , EFF will also continue its fight in Washington , working in the next session of Congress — a Congress likely to be much different in its composition than today ’s , and working with a different president — to wipe the stain of the FAA ’s immunity provisions off the books .
What you see here is not a simple array of LCD displays .
This is NASA 's hyperwall - 2 , the world 's highest resolution visualization system .
At 23 by 10 feet wide , hyperwall - 2 uses 128 screens driven by 128 graphic processing units with a total of 1,024 processor cores capable of displaying quarter billion - pixel graphics .
That 's 74 teraflops of power - the number - crunching capacity of six hundred last - generation consoles - accessing 475 terabytes of data , what scientists and Led Zeppelin technically classify as " a whooping whole lotta love . "
Instead of gaming , however , this massive display will be used for more mundane things like , you know , black holes or saving lives .
NASA says that this system will be key to visually analyzing massive data sets .
These goes from peeking at black hole collisions to studying global weather patterns , and the design of the new vehicles needed for future manned space programs , as well as assisting in the safety of existing ones .
Using hyperwall - 2 , NASA engineers will be able to analyze re-entries for the space shuttle .
Remember when you were three and thought " I want to be an astronaut " but then you left home to …
NASA Develops World 's Highest Resolution Visualization System
MOFFETT FIELD , Calif .
The power to visualize highly complex information in a way that 's easier for the human mind to grasp is taking a giant leap forward with the advent of NASA 's new hyperwall - 2 system unveiled today at Ames Research Center .
Developed by scientists and engineers in the NASA Advanced Supercomputing ( NAS ) Division at Ames , the 128 - screen hyperwall - 2 , capable of rendering one quarter billion pixel graphics , is the world 's highest resolution scientific visualization and data exploration environment .
The new tool enables scientists to quickly explore datasets that otherwise would take many years to analyze .
The 23 - foot - wide by 10 - foot tall liquid crystal display wall is being used to view , analyze , and communicate results from NASA 's high - fidelity modeling and simulation projects supporting the safety of new space exploration vehicle designs , atmospheric re-entry analysis for the space shuttle , earthquakes , climate change , global weather and black hole collisions .
" The hyperwall - 2 offers a supercomputer - scale environment that is truly up to the task of visualization and exploration of the very large datasets routinely produced by NASA supercomputers and instruments , " said Bryan Biegel , NAS deputy chief .
" The system also will be used to get highly detailed information on how NAS supercomputers are operating , enabling staff to quickly and precisely diagnose problems or inefficiencies with the supercomputers or the software running on them . "
Designed and developed by the NAS visualization team in partnership with Colfax International , Sunnyvale , Calif. , the system is powered by 128 graphics processing units and 1,024 processor cores , with 74 teraflops ( one teraflop equals one trillion floating point operations per second ) of peak processing power and a data storage capacity of 475 terabytes ( one terabyte equals one trillion bytes ) .
The hyperwall - 2 allows researchers to quickly determine trends across an array of related simulation results , or to view a single large image or animation .
It would take nearly 600 video game consoles to equal the hyperwall - 2's graphics processing capabilities .
" We are proud to continue partnering with NAS as it offers advanced , innovative solutions for high - performance computing , " said Gautam Shah , chief executive officer , Colfax International .
" As NASA Ames successfully responds to support the visualization and data analysis needs of researchers to maximize the understanding of scientific results , Colfax International is pleased to be part of the hyperwall - 2 visualization cluster project , " Shah added .
Colfax previously built a " mini " hyperwall for NAS used for demonstrations at national conferences .
With a direct , high - speed connection from the supercomputers at NAS , including the Columbia supercomputer , hyperwall - 2 will enable NASA to meet its increasing needs for advanced visualization and analysis of large , high - dimensional simulation results .
With more than 100 times the processing power of the original 49 - screen hyperwall developed in 2002 by the NAS visualization team , hyperwall - 2 will be integrated with the team 's software tools .
This includes a state - of - the - art concurrent visualization framework to provide NASA scientists and engineers with ultra-high resolution images and videos to explore results of their research and analysis .
Sunset so soon ?
( Catamount ) Duke Energy , one of the biggest coal - burning utilities in the U.S. , just added another clean - energy company to its growing portfolio .
The Charlotte , NC - based company will pay $ 320 million for Catamount Energy Corp. , a small wind - power developer based in Vermont .
There are a few possible readings here .
First , maybe rising capital costs of coal and nuclear power plants �as well as rising fuel costs for coal and natural gas�really are turning the tables against traditional ways to generate power and ...
STRATFORD , Connecticut ( CNN ) --
When Cappie and Don Perras saw their stock market investments tank this year , they decided to tighten their belts .
They drive fuel efficient cars around their Connecticut town and eat at cheaper restaurants if they eat out at all .
To avoid impulse buying , they avoid the mall .
And for now , at least , they 've put away the credit cards .
Like many Americans , the Perrases rarely use their credit cards anymore .
This marks a big change from their old attitude .
" I felt secure with my credit cards like , ' Oh well , I always have my credit cards , ' " says Cappie Perras , a special education teacher .
" Now I feel like , it 's almost like there 's a big caution sign in front of the credit card , ' Do Not Use , Only In Case of Emergency , ' " she adds .
The Perrases are examples of a trend building among middle - income and middle - aged consumers to cut back on credit card use , according to a new study by Javelin Strategy & Research , a financial research firm .
Forty percent of consumers surveyed said they 're pulling out their credit cards less than they were at the beginning of the year .
Watch one family stop the credit cards »
Don Perras , a college professor approaching retirement age , says the family has stopped using cards , except for rare instances like booking hotel rooms on the road .
Instead , the couple uses their debit cards .
The aim : to soon be free of credit card debt .
" It would be a top priority , " Don Perras said .
But with the high cost of living , the Perrases are having trouble making a dent in their $ 8,000 credit card balance .
" I used to be able to maybe put $ 600 towards the debt .
...
Now it 's maybe if I 'm lucky , $ 200 , " his wife says .
The Perras family has plenty of company .
Americans carry approximately $ 961.8 billion in revolving debt , according to the Federal Reserve Board .
Delinquency rates on credit cards are at the highest levels since the end of 2002 .
Even as consumers cut back on using credit cards , they 're finding it harder to pay down their balances , says Javelin President James Van Dyke .
" In some cases they 're out of work or perhaps their wages have been cut back , or maybe they had a variable rate which they have to pay more for than ever before , " Van Dyke said .
When people use their credit cards less , " this changes what goes on in the industry because credit card companies typically make a lot of their money on the fees they charge merchants . "
The reduction in revenue from new purchases , combined with concerns about new delinquencies , pose big worries for the credit card industry , Van Dyke says .
" Credit card companies are running a bit scared right now , and for good reason , because people are having a difficult time paying off their balances ; and everyday consumers , they 're cutting into their purchases right now -- both luxury goods and even the basic necessities , " Van Dyke says .
According to the Javelin study , nearly 70 percent of financial institutions say they have cut back on credit card solicitations .
Six of 10 say they are limiting the amount of credit offered to customers .
James Chessen , chief economist for the American Bankers Association , says the industry is well prepared for the economic downturn .
" It 's all a matter of managing that risk , because you know the volume will be off , you know the economy is riskier today than it was a year ago .
So you naturally take that into account so you have the capacity to come out of this even stronger than you came into it , " he added .
For Cappie Perras , being stronger means cutting back on plastic .
" I do n't feel good about the credit cards , " she says .
" I regret that we got into so much credit card debt . "
Paul Krugman writes :
…( according to Reinhart and Rogoff ) the resolution of Sweden ’s financial crisis imposed a fiscal burden – that is , required a taxpayer - financed bailout – equal to 6 percent of GDP .
That would be $ 850 billion in America today .
Just saying .
It ’s worth noting that such costs consist mostly of transfers rather than real resource costs .
Most of the costs of overinvestment in housing already have been borne in the form of lower living standards , namely we have fewer non-housing goods and services .
Making debt obligations whole again does involve higher taxes but most of the money is sloshed around ; the government does n’t dynamite any factories or homes .
It should bother you if you think taxes are already too high but of course that does n’t describe everyone .
Furthermore if the destruction of the debt claim would otherwise have been deflationary , some of that debt can be monetized ( thus , taxes do n’t go up ) without raising the risk of inflation .
( TC : the Swedish number seems to be wrong , see the first comment . )
Here are a few other points about bailouts , or non-bailouts , as the case may be :
1 . Most plans for Fed assistance are n’t bailouts at all .
It is pretty easy for the Fed or Treasury to virtually wipe out shareholders .
The real " bailouts " come when the institutions are allowed to stay open and continue taking risks .
2 . The Fed ’s regulatory powers make crisis deals less than fair .
If you , as a bank , do n’t accept the Fed ’s terms , you can be prosecuted or thrown in jail or at least ruined by your friendly regulator .
Being an advocate of the rule of law , I ’m not entirely comfortable with this arrangement , but it does mean that the Fed has a much easier time managing crises .
Keep in mind also that the failing banks are indeed the most likely ones to have been criminal , so the unfairness is not usually being applied to the innocent .
3 . If you think the managers were in charge , and will remain in charge , the real moral hazard problem is the severance pay for the failed managers , not the so - called bailouts .
4 . If you ’re a critic of bailouts , you ca n’t have it both ways .
If the Fed or Treasury is guaranteeing loans , yes that does put taxpayer dollars on the line .
But if you think the system can hold up , as do most bailout critics , those guarantees are unlikely to cost very much .
The Fed or Treasury may even turn a profit .
If you think the system cannot hold up , the bailout is probably necessary even if costly .
So you ca n’t claim : " The bailout is n’t needed " and also " The bailout will burden taxpayers . "
Addendum :
By the way , do read David Leonhardt on " what really happened . "
From ClusterStock :
So far , it seems as though the tax rebate checks are n't so much stimulating the economy as they are Wal - Mart , Exxon , and your food bill .
( And soon , Apple , whose 3G iPhone comes out next Friday . )
If there is anything left after that , people might actually be paying down debt and / or saving their checks .
And , of course , there 's one more way the tax rebates are adding stimulus : porn .
From an Adult Internet Market Research Company press release :
An independent market - research firm , AIMRCo ( Adult Internet Market Research Company ) , has discovered that many websites focused on adult or erotic material have experienced an upswing in sales in the recent weeks since checks have appeared in millions of Americans ' mailboxes across the country .
According to Kirk Mishkin , Head Research Consultant for AIMRCo , " Many of the sites we surveyed have reported 20 - 30 % growth in membership rates since mid-May when the checks were first sent out , and typically the summer is a slow period for this market . "
Jillian Fox , spokeswoman for LSGmodels.com , one of the sites reporting figures to AIMRCo , added , " In a June 15 , 2008 survey to our members , thirty two percent of respondents referenced the recent stimulus package as part of their decision to either become a new member , or renew an existing membership .

Auditors at a Pentagon oversight agency were pressured by supervisors to skew their reports on major defense contractors to make them look more favorable instead of exposing wrongdoing and charges of overbilling , according to an 80 - page report released yesterday by the Government Accountability Office .
The Defense Contract Audit Agency , which oversees contractors for the Defense Department , “ improperly influenced the audit scope , conclusions and opinions ” of reviews of contractor performance , the GAO said , creating a “ serious independence issue . ”
The report does not name the projects or the contractors involved , but staff members on the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee who were briefed on the findings cited seven contractors , some of whom are among the biggest in the defense industry : Boeing , Northrop Grumman , Fluor , Parker Hannifin , Sparta , SRS Technologies and a subsidiary of L3 Communications .
( Article continues below )
Supervisors at DCAA attempted to intimidate auditors , prevented them from speaking with GAO investigators and created a “ generally abusive work environment , ” the report said .
It cited incidents of “ verbal admonishments , reassignments and threats of disciplinary action ” against workers who “ raised questions about management guidance . ”
In a case later identified as involving Boeing , the GAO said the agency made “ an upfront agreement ” with the company to limit the scope of work and basis for an audit in 2002 .
The audit related to a cost - and - pricing system of aircraft that included the C - 17 , aerial refueling tanker , the B - 1 and other planes , according to documentation provided to Congressional staff members .
These deals were being negotiated by Darleen Druyun who was then a top Air Force acquisition official .
Druyun later went to prison after admitting that she favored Boeing in selecting its tanker while she was seeking a job with the company .

Link : Inhabitat » MILE HIGH ULTIMA TOWER : Vertical eco city works like a tree .
“ We ’ve seen a whole slew of gigantic , volcano shaped , city - in - a - building towers , each promising to be the largest building in the world .
First it was the wacky X - Seed design for Tokyo , and then even Norman Foster got into the game with his proposal for the massive ‘ Crystal Island ’ development in Moscow .
“ Well now , architect Eugene Tsui is taking the gigantic volcano tower concept to a whole new eco level , by taking design inspiration from the natural world .
His new design for the Ultima Tower – a 2 - mile high Mt Doom - esque structure – borrows design principles from trees and other living ystem to reduce its energy footprint .
We are always intrigued by architecture that uses biomimicry – the borrowing of principles from nature ’s designs – and Tsui ’s concept for this towering , ultra - dense urban development has certainly captured our attention with its thought - provoking design .
( ( ( Also , it looks completely insane … or at least it makes Frank Lloyd Wright ’s nuclear - powered “ Mile - High ” look like a piker . ) ) )
“ Population growth rates and rural - urban migration are creating a trend of chaotic urbanization that brings environmental , economic and social challenges .
Within the next 7 years , 22 megacities across the globe are expected to have populations that exceed 10 million people , according to the UN .
The Ultima Tower is an innovative green design concept proposed to resourcefully use earth ’s surface and allow sustainable distribution of resources within a dense urban setting .
“ Designed to withstand natural calamities , ( ( ( good idea ) ) ) Ultima Tower is highly stable and aerodynamic .
Rather than spreading horizontally the structure rises vertically from a base with a 7,000 foot diameter – inspired in part by the termite ’s nest structures of Africa , the highest structure created by any living organism … ”
2011 How wine affects your body
A guest article by Estelle Platini from Cellarer.com .
[ There is another article by Estelle on the types of red wines . ]
There has been much suggestion that the drinking of wine is somehow “ good for you . ”
While it might calm your nerves a bit , what many want to say is that , for whatever reason , it can protect you from heart disease , perhaps by lowering cholesterol .
Some point to those parts of the world where people eat high fat diets , drink lots of wine , and live to a very old age .
At this stage of knowledge , it probably is n’t a good idea to start drinking to obtain hypothetical protective effects .
Whether it helps you if you are drinking is controversial .
Most people will agree that if you drink “ too much , ” it is not good for you ( for a variety of reasons ) .
Drunkenness
Getting drunk happens in some social circumstances — like the end of college .
The liver filters alcohol and sends it to the blood stream .
This notably affects your brain ( and damages it a little for many weeks ) .
You should switch to water when you are feeling dizzy .
In any case , do not ever drive a car ( or a bike ) after a glass .
Lead in wine
Some people are concerned about high levels of lead in wine .
A possible reason is that the high acidity levels in wine help to cause lead to leach out of things that it touches .
Lead “ capsules ” ( the foil at the top of the bottle ) have all but disappeared from new bottles of wine for this reason .
You can wipe the top of a bottle with a damp cloth before pouring if you have an older bottle with a lead capsule .
There is some reason to believe that lead can be leached out of lead crystal glasses .
Whether this occurs in significant numbers in the short run I do not at this time know , but I have read some material that indicates it is not a good idea to store an alcoholic beverage in crystal decanters for long periods of time .
Other negative effects
Addition to alcohol is called alcoholism .
It pushes you to continue taking alcohol .
Alcohol can damage your liver .
Allergies , sulphites , natural wines
The biggest complaint here is that some people develop headaches from drinking wine .
There are several proposed causes .
One is that sulphites added by the producer ( or can be naturally present in lesser amounts ) cause the allergic reaction .
Furthermore , it has been suggested that cheaper wines are likely to have more sulphites as a cheap substitute for careful grape selection and winemaking .
Some people say that it is only red wine that causes them a problem .
Sulphites are present in both red and white wines .
Another possible cause is anthocyanin pigments which are what makes “ red ” grapes red .
These are also present in blue cheese .
If both cause you problems , maybe you ’ve found a reason ?
Solutions suggested by some ( but not recommended or approved by me in any way ) are : Drink lots of water before drinking the wine .
Take a pain - killer first .
The problem with this last one is that is known to enhance the alcoholic affect .
The best answer is , if this is a problem , do n’t drink wine .
While there are wines that claim to be sulphite free , some people will tell you that this is not possible , as sulphites exist in nature on the grape .
However , the amount would be less if not artificially introduced .
The French Scout details explanations on organic winemaking and sulphite use .
But since sulfur dioxide is often used to control how the wine is produced ( getting rid of unwanted yeasts , molds and bacteria ) , some feel that you may not get as good a wine .
United States law requires that wine with over 10 parts per million of sulphites state that the wine “ contains ” sulphites .
Yet some wineries produce wine with very little sulphites .
If this is important to you , you should look for sulphite - free wines near you .
Calories in wine
Most of the calories in wine come from alcohol , though some additional calories come from the “ food ” that came from the fruit ( proteins , carbohydrates [ like sugar ] , etc. ) .
Since some wines are more dry than sweet ( that is , they have less sugar ) , those wines would have a little less calories .
Also , wines vary in alcohol content , which would , of course , also affect the number of calories from alcohol .
The United States Department of Agriculture says that 100 grams of “ table wine ” ( 12.2 percent alcohol by volume ) has 85 calories while 100 grams of “ dessert wine ” ( 18.8 percent alcohol by volume ) has 135 calories .
In any event , a pretty good rule of thumb is that table wine has approximately 25 calories per ounce .
When cooking with wine , you can end up boiling out the alcohol .
The result is that the calorie impact from the wine is drastically reduced .
Pregnancy and wine
Heavy alcohol use in pregnancy can lead to birth defects .
Some doctors feel that the safest course is not to drink any alcohol at all during pregnancy .
Others feel that light , occasional drinking has not been shown to be harmful .
Check with your doctor but take your own decision !
Wine as a sleeping aid
The general consensus is that alcohol might help you fall asleep immediately but that you ’ll be up in the middle of the night .
A warm glass of milk seems to be a better idea .
Tannins , resveratrol
Polyphenols and beneficial tannins are found in some young red wines .
It has been reported that resveratrol may induce a number of beneficial health effects , such as anti-cancer , antiviral , neuroprotective , anti-aging , anti-inflammatory and life - prolonging effects .
Beware that some of these studies used animal subjects ( e.g. rats ) .
Resveratrol is found in the skin of red grapes and is a constituent of red wine but , based on extrapolation from animal trials , apparently not in sufficient amounts to explain the “ French paradox ” .
The French paradox is that the incidence of coronary heart disease is relatively low in southern France despite high dietary intake of saturated fats .
Here is more about the chemicals in wine and their effects on the body .
One may also discuss such a thing as sustainable wineries .
Some elements of wine can be beneficial , such as resveratrol or OPCs .

Or Felicien ’s primer on red types of wines ( per variety and district ) ?

Revisiting Coroutines , by Ana Lucia de Moura and Roberto Ierusalimschy :
This paper defends the revival of coroutines as a general control abstraction .
After proposing a new classification of coroutines , we introduce the concept of full asymmetric coroutines and provide a precise definition for it through an operational semantics .
We then demonstrate that full coroutines have an expressive power equivalent to one - shot continuations and oneshot partial continuations .
We also show that full asymmetric coroutines and one - shot partial continuations have many similarities , and therefore present comparable benefits .
Nevertheless , coroutines are easier implemented and understood , specially in the realm of procedural languages .
Finally , we provide a collection of programming examples that illustrate the use of full asymmetric coroutines to support direct and concise implementations of several useful control behaviors , including cooperative multitasking .
Coroutines seem to get fairly short riff in the literature , and they have only been discussed on LTU , a couple of times .
Given coroutines have such a straightforward mapping to hardware , I hope they get more attention .
Coroutines show up in many different places .
For instance , the inter - process communication ( IPC ) facilities of microkernels , like EROS , are a faithful implementation of asymmetric coroutines , with an important difference .
Essentially , yield and resume must both take an explicit coroutine argument naming the coroutine respectively yield to and resume .
If the coroutine to yield to is left implicit , as it is in most treatments I 've seen , then coroutines become less composable since yield returns control to the innermost resume which , given abstract types , might be the wrong one .
This problem is discussed in Section 5.6 , " Avoiding Interference Between Control Actions " .
The paper recommends tagging coroutines to match up resume / yield pairs , but the EROS IPC system provides a more direct encoding via a " resume " capability , which is a single - use coroutine used to return control directly to a client .
Each subsequent invocation of the object synthesizes a new resume capability .
Taking this to the extreme implies that yield and resume can be unified into a single " invoke " operation which accepts a coroutine argument to be used in a subsequent invoke operation .
Indeed , these are " symmetric coroutines " .
This paper suggests that symmetric coroutines are harder to understand due to the actors / CPS - like nature of the control flow .
Berlin crowd cheers Obama

Sen . Barack Obama , standing before a cheering crowd of more than 200,000 in Berlin - many waving American flags - Thursday delivered an historic political address to a worldwide audience , telling Europeans that " there is no challenge too great for a world that stands as one " against terrorism and for peace .
In a speech that echoed famed addresses by both John F. Kennedy and Ronald Reagan - two American presidents who delivered landmark addresses in Berlin - the Democratic presidential contender urged Americans and their European allies , who together defeated communism , to " defeat terror and dry up the well of extremism that supports it . "
" The walls between old allies on either side of the Atlantic cannot stand , " the Illinois Senator said .
" The walls between the countries with the most and those with the least cannot stand .
The walls between races and tribes , natives and immigrants , Christian and Muslim and Jew cannot stand , " he said .
" History reminds us that walls can be torn down , but the task is never easy , " said Obama .
" True partnership and true progress requires constant work and sustained sacrifice ... they require allies who will listen to each other , learn from each other , and most of all trust each other , " he said to cheers .
Though Illinois Senator 's address succeeded in delivering unprecedented international attention to his campaign in the midst of 2008 presidential contest , he told the Berlin audience that " I speak to you not as a candidate for president , but as a citizen - a proud citizen of the United States - and fellow citizen of the world . "
He acknowledged to cheers that " I do n't look like the Americans who have previously spoken in this great city , " noting his mother " was born in the heartland of America , but my father grew up herding goats in Kenya , " a note that was met with cheers from the crowd .
Obama 's address noted both past American differences and its common ground with Europe - even as he acknowledged his country 's strengths and mistakes .
" I know my country has not perfected itself , " he said .
" At times , we 've struggled to keep the promise of liberty and equality ( alive ) ... we 've made our share of mistakes . "
But he said , " I also know how much I love America ...
I know for more than two centuries , we have strived ... to form a more perfect union . "
Obama 's address in Berlin held both delicate challenges and potential pitfalls for the candidate .
By speaking directly to a huge audience in the heart of what former Bush defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld once dismissed as " old Europe , " many said Obama had the opportunity to repair bonds and restore some of the good will that critics say was squandered after 9/11 by the Bush Administration as well as to outline a call for " change " to a worldwide audience .
And on the day of its delivery , Sen .
John McCain 's camp suggested the Illinois Senator appears to think he 's already U.S. president , seizing on a report in the Atlantic Monthly that said he 's already forming a transition team for the White House .
Republicans particularly jumped on the report , asking small groups of aides to " begin thinking through the process .
Before they 've even crossed the 50 - yard line , the Obama campaign is already dancing in the end zone with a new White House transition team , " said McCain spokesman Brian Rogers .
" The American people are more concerned with Barack Obama 's poor judgment and readiness to lead than his inaugural ball . "
Prior to the address , Obama senior strategist Robert Gibbs released a statement underscoring Obama 's outreach to European leaders , saying the candidate had " a warm and productive conversation " with German Chancellor Angela Merkel .
" They covered a wide range of foreign policy issues , including Afghanistan , Iraq , Iran , the Middle East peace process , Russia , and NATO .
Senator Obama offered an overview of his trip and key impressions from discussions with leaders in the region , focusing , in particular , on the urgency of stopping Iran 's pursuit of nuclear weapons , " he said .
" They also discussed climate change and broader economic challenges . ''
Obama 's Berlin address came as a new NBC Wall Street Journal poll showed strong evidence that Americans are looking for a new direction for the country ; 74 percent of voters now believe that the country is on the wrong track , the lowest number ever recorded in the poll .
The last time so many Americans held negative views about their country 's direction was in 1992 , when Democratic former Arkansas Gov. Bill Clinton beat incumbent President George H.W.
Bush in what was viewed as a pivotal " change " election .
But although Obama has held a 5 to 6 point national lead in many national polls , the latest polls show McCain has made some significant gains in key battleground states like Colorado , especially with regard to his national security and foreign policy credentials .
The Obama speech generated extraordinary attention in Europe regarding the appearance of a U.S. presidential candidate .
Reporters on the scene said hundreds lined the streets in Berlin just to catch a glimpse of the candidate outside his hotel , Obama tee shirts sprung up around the city , a festive carnival atmosphere enveloped the city and thousands gathered hours before the speech to get a good spot .
Without a doubt , the Federal Reserve now faces the most difficult financial and economic climate in our collective memory .
And it is increasingly apparent that its options are constrained .
Although it is premature to arrive at definitive judgments , it ’s nevertheless worth asking whether some of these limitations were unwittingly self - created .
Friday ’s market rout , triggered by the one - two punch of an unexpectedly large rise in unemployment and an $ 11 spike in oil prices , put paid to the idea that the Fed might put through a wee interest rate increase before year end .
We did n’t expect anything more than 25 basis points , since the second leg of the credit crunch , this time dragging down regional and local banks , is underway .
And Wall Street has not hit bottom either .
But as Wolfgang Munchau tells us in the Financial Times , for the first time in modern memory , a foreign central bank ’s stance , in this case , the ECB ’s , is limiting the Fed ’s scope of action :
In the past , European central bankers tended to follow the US Federal Reserve , often with delay , never perfectly , but generally in the same direction ….. The policy response to our most recent financial crisis has been different .
While the Fed cut by an accumulated 325 basis points , the Europeans first refused to follow , and they are now moving in the opposite direction ….
the ECB is now likely to raise interest rates by 25 basis points next month , and I suspect this could be followed by another rate increase later this year … .
This suggests that in terms of global monetary policy , we are in the middle of a shift from a unipolar to a bipolar world .
In the past , the Fed ’s policy alone used to determine the global monetary policy stance – via the dollar , the global anchor currency .
Through long periods of loose monetary policies , including lengthy episodes of negative real interest rates , the Fed contributed directly to the rise in global inflation … .
In theory , an independent central bank , under a floating currency regime , can achieve whatever inflation target it wants , no matter what happens elsewhere .
In practice , central banks , even tough - talking ones such as the ECB , make compromises .
The ECB would not have raised interest rates if the euro ’s exchange rate to the dollar had been at $ 1.70 , or if the economy looked as though it were to fall into a black hole …
The policy goal of the Fed , meanwhile , appears to be avoidance of recession and minimising distress in the financial system .
Price stability , which also ranks as one official goal in the Fed ’s mandate , seems to be pursued by means of sanctimonious speeches , rather than policy action .
As monetary policy of the world ’s two largest economies moves in starkly opposite directions , interesting possibilities are opening up .
One is whether the dollar will decline prematurely as a global currency – an issue on which economists are divided .
Differential inflation rates could plausibly trigger such a shift .
As US inflation rises , more and more countries may unpeg from the dollar to avoid imported inflation .
If this trend persisted , the US would risk losing its exorbitant privilege – the ability to live beyond its means thanks to a globally domineering currency .
Before we get to the Fed ’s options , to give a fuller appreciation of the difficulty of this situation , Evans Ambrose - Pritchard of the Telegraph , in opposition to Munchau ’s view , sees Trichet ’s presumed move to tighten as unwise :
ECB chief Jean - Claude Trichet has “ signalled ” a rate rise in July to combat 3.6 pc inflation , much to the fury of Paris , Madrid , Rome , Lisbon and Dublin …
The ECB demarche is ominous for the rest of us as well .
We may be watching a replay of the Bundesbank ’s ill - judged rate rise in October 1987 , which sent the dollar into a tailspin and triggered the Black Monday crash .
Any tilt to monetary tightening is a dangerous gamble at this delicate juncture .
The world is facing an almighty clash between two opposing storm systems .
The West is in the full grip of a debt deflation as years of credit abuse come back to haunt it .
The East – loosely speaking – is in the blow - off phase of an inflationary boom .
Russia , Ukraine , Vietnam and the Gulf are out of control .
China has dithered beyond the point of no return .
It is they who have repeated the errors of the 1970s , not the West .
It will take central banking skills of great subtlety to pilot these seas .
Slavish adherence to “ inflation - targeting ” and other such totemism and pseudo - science will ruin us all …
America is going from bad to worse …
Fed chairman Ben Bernanke knows that the crunch will tame inflation over time ….. But Bernanke is now compelled – against his better judgment – to declare an end to the easing cycle .
An interest floor of 2 pc has been fixed …
The ECB policy shift has already had a perverse effect .
By sending the dollar into a fresh dive this week , it triggered a $ 16 surge in the price of oil over two days .
Crude is now moving almost reflexively as a sort of “ anti- dollar ” , a currency on steroids with eight times leverage .
No matter that the global economy is slowing hard .
Bad is good for oil in the topsy - turvy world of commodity funds .
We are in uncharted waters .
The easy trade - off between growth and inflation that so flattered asset prices for a quarter century is over .
The monetary lords can no longer shield us from the full consequences of our debts .
Note that despite their polar opposite views on whether inflation or deflation is a bigger risk for developed economies , both Munchau and Evans - Pritchard now see Bernanke as unable to cut rates below 2 % due to adverse consequences on other fronts ( note that heretofore , going to 1 % , as the Fed did in earlier in the decade , had been an option .
Indeed , Merrill Lynch economist David Rosenberg had forecast the Fed funds rate at 1 % for all of 2009 a mere month ago ) .
Bernanke has treated the dollar with benign neglect , but now that the oil has become a preferred dollar hedge .
Even if oil would fall to $ 110 , it would still put brakes on the economy , and oil above $ 130 or higher will suck any remaining life out of the economy .
The high prices have n’t yet worked their way through to the pump , and the secondary effects , such as the price effects of higher shipping costs , are only beginning to kick in .
But how did the Fed get itself here ?
There are different ways to frame the problem .
We ’re of the view that the central bank took rates too low and left them low for too long in the dot - bomb era , and cut too deep , too fast this time .
Former Fed economist Richard Alford explains that those decisions were the product of a flawed analytical framework :
One of the interesting aspects of economic policy in the US is a belief that we exist independent of the rest of the world .
In the minds of many policy makers , the US is the focus and the rest of world economy is just a stable background .
To open the model up to external factors , market imperfections , and quasi- floating exchange rates would increase the complexity of the model and limit the number of policy prescriptions that could be made , so most US economists pretend that the rest of the world does not exist , is stable , or that the dollar will quickly adjust so as to maintain US external balances .
It has only been in the past few years that the trade deficit has moved to a level that is clearly unsustainable … .
If you look at the difference between gross domestic purchases and potential output , by US consumers , businesses , and government — all are above potential output .
The only time in recent memory when the difference between these two measures started to narrow was in 2001 when we were in a recession .
One of the things we need to consider is that that US may need to see consumption drop significantly before we can achieve a sustainable position , for example vis a vis the dollar …
T]he demand side is fine .
Remember , US domestic purchases are still running around 105 - 106 % of potential domestic output .
The problem is not the level of demand but rather the composition of demand .
Americans are buying too many imported goods and the world is not buying enough of our exports .
So we have a growing wedge growing between gross domestic purchases , which is what the Fed really controls , and net aggregate demand , which is defined as gross domestic purchases less the trade deficit .
Given the inability or unwillingness of the US to correct the trade imbalance , the Fed has run expansionary monetary policy almost continuously , generating higher levels of domestic purchases so as to keep net aggregate demand near potential output .
The Fed did this using low interest rates , which generated asset bubbles , large increases in consumer debt and sharp declines in savings , and also a larger trade deficit .
But there ’s another constraint the Fed has taken as a given : recessions are to be avoided , or if that is n’t possible , kept short and shallow .
While slowdowns not only do damage , but in our society of tattered social safety nets , do the most damage to the poor and lower income , they may be the least bad of unattractive alternatives .
The price of milder recessions has been stagnant average worker incomes .
Economists have come to regard the so - called Great Moderation as a state of affairs that can be engineered to continue in perpetuity .
Yet Thomas Palley has argued that that view is flawed and the real source was the erosion of labor ’s bargaining power :
The raised standing of central bankers rests on a phenomenon that economists have termed the “ Great Moderation . ”
This phenomenon refers to the smoothing of the business cycle over the last two decades , during which expansions have become longer , recessions shorter , and inflation has fallen .
Many economists attribute this smoothing to improved monetary policy by central banks , and hence the boom in central banker reputations … .
That said , there are other less celebratory accounts of the Great Moderation that view it as a transitional phenomenon , and one that has also come at a high cost … .
The great Polish economist Michal Kalecki observed that full employment would likely cause inflation because job security would prompt workers to demand higher wages .
That is what happened in the 1960s and 1970s .
However , rather than solving this political problem , economic policy retreated from full employment and assisted in the evisceration of unions .
That lowered inflation , but it came at the high cost of two decades of wage stagnation and a rupturing of the link between wage and productivity growth …..
The important implication is that the Great Moderation is the result of a retreat from full employment combined with the transitional factors of disinflation , asset price inflation , and increased consumer borrowing .
Those factors now appear exhausted .
Further disinflation will produce disruptive deflation .
Asset prices ( particularly real estate ) seem above levels warranted by fundamentals , making for the danger of asset price deflation .
And many consumers have exhausted their access to credit and now pose significant default risks .
Many readers have reacted angrily to statements by economists , particularly those who see themselves as liberal , such as Paul Krugman , that we should be relieved that inflation is n’t becoming embedded , as in generating demands for higher wages that then spiral into even higher costs .
They see every day as prices climb that their paycheck goes less far , and the fact that their inability to get compensating pay increases is portrayed as a good thing is galling .
Even if they do n’t see the broader policy context , they see the consequences full well .
The Fed ’s third constraint is what Willem Buiter calls cognitive regulatory capture .
Munchau mentioned its symptom : a policy of “ minimizing distress in the financial system , ” which again creates a bias towards overly accommodative monetary policies .
Buiter describes its source :
I believe a key reason is that the Fed listens to Wall Street and believes what it hears , or at any rate , acts as if it believes what Wall Street tells it .
Wall Street tells the Fed about its pain , what its pain means for the economy at large and what the Fed ought to do about it .
Wall Street ’s pain was indeed great – deservedly so in most cases .
Wall Street engaged in special pleading by exaggerating the impact on the wider economy of the rapid deleveraging ( contraction of the size of the balance sheets ) that was taking place .
Wall Street wanted large rate cuts fast so as to improve its solvency , not its liquidity , and Wall Street wanted the provision of ample liquidity against overvalued collateral .
Why did Wall Street get what it wanted ?
Throughout the ten months of the crisis , it is difficult to avoid the impression that the Fed is too close to the financial markets and leading financial institutions , and too responsive to their special pleadings , to make the right decisions for the economy as a whole .
Historically , the same behaviour has characterised the Greenspan Fed .
It came as something of a surprise to me that the Bernanke Fed , if not quite a clone of the Greenspan Fed , displays the same excess sensitivity to Wall Street concerns .
The main evidence to me of Fed excess sensitivity to Wall Street concerns are ( 1 ) the two cuts in the primary discount rate ; ( 2 ) the decision to let the clearing bank acting for the primary dealer price the collateral offered by the primary dealer to the Fed in both the TSLF and the PDCF ; ( 3 ) the modalities of the Bear Stearns rescue , and especially the roads not taken ; ( 4 ) the proposal that interest be paid on reserves without making this conditional on interest not being paid on required reserves ; and ( 5 ) the aggressive interest rate cuts since August 2007 , and especially the 75 basis points cut on January 21/22 2008 .
There are other signs as well .
For instance , the Fed has become , to put it crudely , Wall Street ’s bitch .
It is now assumed that the Fed will not let any meaningful institution fail because they are allegedly too interconnected , as if the US consists of one mega bank rather than individual institutions .
But is that true in all cases ?
Having permitted the banking industry to make its own risk ( effectively capital ) decisions for derivatives , it handed the industry a blank check in the mid-late 1990s , And the Street will always lever more when it can , since all things being equal , higher gearing is the course to greater profit .
But some animals are more equal than others .
Bear Stearns , by virtue of being a major credit default swaps protection writer , could have triggered cascading defaults in the primed - for - disaster credit default swaps market .
Like it or not , they could not be cut loose .
Yet while even high profile short says Lehman is not going to fail ( and the central bank ’s latest round of facilities is a big reason why ) .
Yet would a Lehman failure have created a systemic crisis ?
I ’m not convinced that the firm is so deeply or fundamentally involved in the most vulnerable parts of the securities markets as to make that a necessity .
But regardless , Lehman , along with its peers , is now the beneficiary of the central bank ’s largess .
And the Fed has been way too cautious about insisting that the firms that now benefit from its salvage operations adhere to new , tougher rules .
Yes , it ’s an election year , which means nothing will happen .
But that ’s more reason to talk a tough line .
The longer investment banks have explicit socialized losses and privatized gains , the harder it will be to roll the new status quo back .
I was similarly distressed to see the timid turns of phrase used by New York Fed president Timothy Geithner in a Financial Times comment , a preview to a speech he will give at the Economist Club of New York today .
It grandly talks about things that would be desirable to happen , and too little of regulators being in charge .
In fact , the subtext is a reluctance to assert authority , yet in the same article , Geithner ( of course ) advocates regulatory streamlining in the US with the Fed as the main actor .
Some illustrations :
This will require more exacting expectations on capital , liquidity and risk management for the largest institutions that play a central role in intermediation and market functioning .
They should be set high enough to offset the benefits that come from access to central bank liquidity , but not so high that they succeed only in pushing more capital to the unregulated part of the financial system …..
As we reshape the incentives and constraints for risk - taking in the financial system , we have to recognise that regulation has the potential to make things worse .
Regulation can distort incentives in ways that may make the system less safe .
One of the strengths of our system is the speed with which we adapt to challenge .
It is important that we move quickly to adapt the regulatory system to address the vulnerabilities exposed by this financial crisis .
We are beginning the process of building the necessary consensus here and with the other main financial centres .
Notice the litany of reasons to be half - hearted about imposing rules : more capital might go to unregulated players ( fine , just prohibit regulated concerns from lending to them ) ; regulations can have adverse outcomes ( yes , but any form of insurance is costly , and after what we have been through , light regulation has been an utter disaster ) ; we need the consent of the regulated ( since when ?
Oh , since they bought all the politicians ) .
I can only hope that new appointments at the Fed will also bring a new tough - mindedness .
But that ’s probably too much to expect .
Twenty eight years ago Russian army has entered Afghanistan .
They stayed there for 9 years and more than 15,000 Russian soldiers were lost dead , much more were wounded or had psychological problems in their civil life later .
The troops that were fighting against Russian army at that times were actively supported by Pakistan and Western World as an opposing effort of the Free World against the Evil Empire – USSR .
One of the most notable leaders supporting the rebels against the “ Russian oppression ” in Afghanistan was a Western supported Osama Bin-Laden .
A few years later , when there were nobody to fight against in Afghanistan he found new victims for his fight .
Now in the Free Western World that supported him before , with all the tactical skills his people were studied by Western instructors .
In Russia there is a proverb , something like “ Do n’t dig a hole for someone else , as you will fall into it yourself ” , some Russian soldiers found that it was true in this occasion , after learning that those guy they fought for years , took over the Afghanistan after they left and started to fight now against his supporters .
These are photos from that time when the Russian army was still there , mainly from private archives .

Obama camp charging voting problems in PA Nick Juliano

Print This Email This Update : Local campaign alleges ' dirty tricks ' in voting problems Barack Obama 's campaign has been circulating anecdotal reports of voting machine problems in some Philadelphia precincts , according to news reports .
The site Election Journal has been compiling reports of voting machine malfunctions and other problems throughout the day Tuesday .
Brad Friedman also is compiling reports of voting problems on his blog .
According to the Philadelphia Inquirer , several machines were malfunctioning in the city , leading one local candidates campaign to allege " dirty tricks " were the cause .
Readers and Inquirer reporters attempting to cast ballots this morning found long lines across the region created by broken machines .
One of two machines was down at a busy Delaware County polling site .
About 50 people already had voted by 9:15 a.m. at the Temple Israel on Spruce and Bywood Avenue in Upper Darby , which is heavily populated by immigrant and first time voters .
Many of those freshly - minted voters had difficulties using the one machine that still functioned .
" Hell of a day for one of the machines to be down , " said one poll worker .
In South Philadelphia , both voting machines were broken at 4th and Ritner , smack dab in the middle of a John Dougherty strong hold .
" The dirty tricks have begun , " said Frank Keel , spokesman for the Dougherty campaign , who sees a conspiracy .
A local elections official interviewed on MSNBC acknowledged some problems early Tuesday morning , but he said those had been resolved before midday .
He denied reports that only one or two voting machines were functional in some predominantly African American neighborhoods .
" We had a few problems early on .
We always do , " Fred Voight , a deputy commissioner in Philadelphia told MSNBC .
Video of Voight 's interview is available here .
He called reports of machines breaking down " flat out untrue " and said " everything is working throughout the city as we speak . "
The interview aired around 11:15 a.m. Tuesday .
The Justice Department announced Monday that it would have monitors in Philadelphia to ensure compliance with voting laws .
Obama 's campaign apparently passed along anecdotal reports of voting machine problems earlier Tuesday morning , MSNBC reported .
Voight told the network that " campaigns are like four steps removed from where things are actually happening . "
In two Pittsburgh neighborhoods , Obama 's campaign also circulated reports of voting problems , according to the Tribune Review : Obama 's campaign said there were problems with machines in Lincoln Place and the Hill District , but county officials could n't confirm that .
The Post Gazette also reported some minor problems but said they were n't causing major delays : Because of the expected large turnout , election judges ' difficulty getting machines started at a polling place in North Braddock and another in the city 's Banksville section prompted some concern .
At these two sites , election judges , clerks and inspectors , all nominally paid volunteers , initially were unable to print out verification that the voting machines had been set at zero .
Nothing was wrong with the machines in either case , Mr. Wolosik said .
A technician was dispatched to each location and helped to properly set up the machines .
More than 30 people in Banksville and several more in North Braddock used emergency paper ballots to cast their votes .
Post - Gazette readers also reported problems at one or two polling stations this morning , including Graham Field and Beacon Hill in Wilkinsburg .
No details were available about those issues .

The judiciary is becoming an important election issue .
John McCain is warning conservatives that control of today 's finely balanced Supreme Court depends on his election .
Unfortunately , his jurisprudence is likely to be anything but conservative .
The idea of a " living Constitution " long has been popular on the political left .
Conservatives routinely dismiss such result - oriented justice , denouncing " judicial activism " and proclaiming their fidelity to " original intent . "
However , many Republicans , like Mr. McCain , are just as ...
As brains age , they slowly lose the ability to generate new neurons , which results in a diminishing ability to learn new things and retain memories .
But today a group of neuroscientists in Florida announced a strange cure for what amounts to brain decay : blood from the umbilical cords of human infants .
When the researchers injected this blood into aging rats , it kickstarted a new round of neurogenesis in their brains , helping them to grow new neurons and shed some other effects of brain aging .
Essentially , effects of aging were rolled back .
There 's tremendous potential here for helping aging humans to regain the plasticity of their youthful minds .
A release about the study explained :
Co-author Alison Willing , PhD , of the USF Center of Excellence for Aging and Brain Repair [ said , ] " The increase in neurogenesis we saw after injecting UCBCs seemed to be due to a decrease in inflammation . "
According to lead author Carmelina Gemma , Ph.D. , of the James A. Haley Veterans Administration Medical Center ( VA ) and USF , the decrease in neurogenesis that accompanies aging is a result of the decrease in proliferation of stem cells , not the loss of cells .
" In the brain , there are two stem cell pools , one of which resides in the hippocampus , " explained graduate student and first author Adam Bachstetter .
" As in other stem cell pools , the stem cells in the brain lose their capacity to generate new cells .
A potent stressor of stem cell proliferation is inflammation . "
Prior to this study , the research team led by Paula C. Bickford , Ph.D. , of the VA and USF found that reducing neuroinflammation in aged rats by blocking the synthesis of the pro-inflammatory cytokine IL1B rescued some of the age - related decrease in neurogenesis and improved cognitive function .
" We think that UCBCs may have a similar potential to reduce inflammation and to restore some of the lost capacity of stem / progenitor cells to proliferate and differentiate into neurons , " said Dr. Bickford .

The United States has often presented itself as the guardian of Internet free speech .
China may censor the Internet , and otherwise - civilized nations such as Germany or France may attempt to block what they view as unacceptable material , but the United States of America likes to think of itself as a place that does n't censor people online ... unless you happen to own a foreign travel business that offers trips to Cuba .
Under such circumstances , as Steve Marshall discovered , all bets are off .
Steve Marshall is a British citizen living in Spain .
For the past decade , he has operated an online travel agency that specializes in selling trips to Cuba to various European nationals .
Marshall operated a number of Cuban - specific web sites , including several that focused specifically on the literary and historical aspects of Cuba , and maintained them in English , French , and Spanish .
The Internet Archive has some of Marshall 's web material on file .
The sites themselves do n't appear to have been particularly well - designed — both Flash and text ads abound — but there 's no evidence that Marshall failed to provide the services he advertised .
According to the Department of the Treasury , however , Marshall and his business helped Americans evade the US embargo against Cuba .
A 2004 DoT ( Department of the Treasury ) press release stated : " This travel provider is not only a generator of resources that the Cuban regime uses to oppress its people , but it also facilitates the evasion of U.S. sanction policy . "
The PR goes on to assert that Tour and Marketing International Ltd. ( Marshall 's company ) advertised itself as the number one agency for American travelers , claimed it could serve any traveler , and insisted that Americans interested in traveling to Cuba use the company 's online payment system .
Marshall 's domain name registrar , eNom , is based in the US .
It apparently did n't learn that his company had been blacklisted for two and a half years .
When it did , however , the registrar promptly shut down Marshall 's sites without notification and has since refused to release the domain names to him .
Marshall has since rebuilt his business using a European registrar and the .net rather than the .com suffix , but his experience raises troubling questions .
As previously noted , Marshall is a British citizen operating a business from Spain , with servers located in the Bahamas .
He does not claim that no Americans ever visited Cuba , but he has stated that he was uninterested in marketing his services to the US .
In this case , the Department of the Treasury was able to shut down his business without notification or negotiation of any sort .
Even if he wanted to appeal the decision , Marshall has no organization to which he can appeal , save his registrar , which can simply claim to have been following government orders .
If the US intends to continue presenting itself as the guardian of Internet rights , situations like this require a bit more delicacy .
By effectively shutting down Marshall 's business , the United States has committed the censorship it condemns in other nations .
Even worse , the Department of Treasury effectively shut down an international business without any type of due process .
Both France and Germany followed a court process when investigating Yahoo for alleged improprieties , and the company in question ( Yahoo ) had the opportunity to respond to the charges in a court of law .
Marshall was afforded no such luxury .
While the Internet may be global in nature , foreign companies may very well limit their use of US registrars and hosting services out of concern that activities targeted at other countries could be shut down here .

In September 2007 , President Bush announced on a nationally televised address that " it will soon be possible to bring home an Army combat brigade , for a total force reduction of 5,700 troops by Christmas " and that " by July , we will be able to reduce our troop levels in Iraq from 20 combat brigades to 15 . "
So when the president announced while in Bahrain earlier this month that he was willing to slow down or stop the pace of planned U.S. troop withdrawals from Iraq , I was shocked , shocked .
After meeting with Gen. David Petraeus , the top U.S. commander in Iraq , and Ryan Crocker , the U.S. ambassador to Baghdad , Bush remarked : " My attitude is , if he [ Petraeus ] did n’t want to continue the drawdown , that ’s fine with me , in order to make sure we succeed , see .
I said to the general , ‘ If you want to slow her down , fine .
It ’s up to you . ’"
Once upon a time  in what seems like a galaxy far , far away  then - Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld had plans to have only 40,000 U.S. troops in Iraq by fall 2003 .
From almost the moment U.S. troops set foot in Iraq the Bush administration has been making promises that the number of boots on the ground would be reduced .
But they have all been empty promises .
For example , in December 2005 then - chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. Peter Pace proclaimed , " If things go the way we expect them to , as more Iraqi units stand up , we ’ll be able to bring our troops down and turn over that territory to the Iraqis . "
Yet again , just a few weeks after Secretary of Defense Robert Gates indicated that five brigade combat teams ( BCTs ) could be withdrawn from Iraq by the middle of 2008 and another five BCTs in the second half of the year , leaving 100,000 U.S. troops in Iraq at the end of this year , it seems that the promise will be broken .
President Bush ’s benchmark continues to be the constantly moving goal posts of " victory . "
Indeed , the United States has had many opportunities to declare victory and give Iraq back to its rightful owners  the Iraqis :
In May 2003 , after three weeks of military operations , President Bush declared " major combat operations in Iraq have ended " while standing in front of a " mission accomplished " banner aboard the USS Abraham Lincoln .
In December 2003 , Saddam Hussein  the former dictator of Iraq  was captured .
In October 2004 , the Iraq Survey Group reported that there were no stockpiles of WMD in Iraq .
In January 2005 , Iraqis had their first general elections to choose representatives for the interim 275 - member Iraqi National Assembly tasked with drafting a constitution .
In October 2005 , the Iraqi constitution was ratified .
In December 2005 , a 275 - member Iraqi Council of Representatives was elected  marking the formation of a permanent , sovereign Iraqi government .
In June 2006 , the most wanted man in Iraq  Abu Musab al - Zarqawi , the leader of al - Qaeda in Iraq and believed to be responsible for most of the suicide bombings in Iraq , as well as the execution of American Nicholas Berg  was killed .
But instead of using these opportunities to craft a much needed ( and now much wanted , as far as the American public is concerned ) exit from Iraq , the president continues to cling to the fantasy of democracy on the Tigris and Euphrates .
Ironically , Bush recently issued another clarion call for democracy in the Middle East while in the United Arab Emirates , a U.S. ally but also an extremely undemocratic country where a royal elite makes virtually all the decisions .
But democracy in foreign lands is not a prerequisite for U.S. security , nor is it the antidote to the terrorist threat confronting America .
Now , although Bush claims the surge is a success , in the next breath he declares that success in Iraq will " require active U.S. engagement that will outlast my presidency . "
I ’m shocked , shocked .

Honoring Senator McCain Through # ActsOfCivility
Senator McCain did n’t always agree with his colleagues in Congress , but he always respected them .
There was nothing he enjoyed more than debating the most pressing issues of the time on the floor of the Senate with his good friend , the late Senator Ted Kennedy , shaking hands at the end of their discussion , and then sharing lunch with one another as friends .
Sadly , this type of civil engagement is all too rare lately .
But we can do something to help reignite a spirit of civility .
To celebrate the life and legacy of Senator McCain , the McCain family and McCain Institute are undertaking and promoting acts of civility and you 're invited to engage in this effort with them .

RUBBISH !
Portland 's top brass said it was OK to swipe your garbage -- so we grabbed theirs .
by CHRIS LYDGATE AND NICK BUDNICK
published : 12/24/2002
It 's past midnight .
Over the whump of the wipers and the screech of the fan belt , we lurch through the side streets of Southeast Portland in a battered white van , double - checking our toolkit : flashlight , binoculars , duct tape , scissors , watch caps , rawhide gloves , vinyl gloves , latex gloves , trash bags , 30 - gallon can , tarpaulins , Sharpie , notebook - - notebook ?
Well , yes .
Technically , this is a journalistic exercise -- at least , that 's what we keep telling ourselves .
We 're upholding our sacred trust as representatives of the Fourth Estate .
Comforting the afflicted , afflicting the comfortable .
Pushing the reportorial envelope -- by liberating the trash of Portland 's top brass .
We did n't dream up this idea on our own .
We got our inspiration from the Portland police .
Back in March , the police swiped the trash of fellow officer Gina Hoesly .
They did n't ask permission .
They did n't ask for a search warrant .
They just grabbed it .
Their sordid haul , which included a bloody tampon , became the basis for drug charges against her ( see " Gross Violation , " below ) .
The news left a lot of Portlanders -- including us -- scratching our heads .
Are n't there rules about this sort of thing ?
Are n't citizens protected from unreasonable search and seizure by the Fourth Amendment ?
The Multnomah County District Attorney 's Office does n't think so .
Prosecutor Mark McDonnell says that once you set your garbage out on the curb , it becomes public property .
" She placed her garbage can out in the open , open to public view , in the public right of way , " McDonnell told Judge Jean Kerr Maurer earlier this month .
" There were no signs on the garbage , ' Do not open .
Do not trespass . '
There was every indication ... she had relinquished her privacy , possessory interest . "
Police Chief Mark Kroeker echoed this reasoning .
" Most judges have the opinion that [ once ] trash is put out ... it's trash , and abandoned in terms of privacy , " he told WW .
In fact , it turns out that police officers throughout Oregon have been rummaging through people 's trash for more than three decades .
Portland drug cops conduct " garbage pulls " once or twice per month , says narcotics Sgt. Eric Schober .
On Dec. 10 , Maurer rubbished this practice .
Scrutinizing garbage , she declared , is an invasion of privacy :
The police must obtain a search warrant before they swipe someone 's trash .
" Personal and business correspondence , photographs , personal financial information , political mail , items related to health concerns and sexual practices are all routinely found in garbage receptacles , " Maurer wrote .
The fact that a person has put these items out for pick - up , she said , " does not suggest an invitation to others to examine them . "
But local law enforcement officials pooh - poohed the judge 's decision .
" This particular very unique and very by - herself judge took a position not in concert with the other judges who had given us instruction by their decisions across the years , " said Kroeker .
The District Attorney 's Office agreed and vowed to challenge the ruling .
The question of whether your trash is private might seem academic .
It 's not .
Your garbage can is like a trap door that opens on to your most intimate secrets ; what you toss away is , in many ways , just as revealing as what you keep .
And your garbage can is just one of the many places where your privacy is being pilfered .
In the wake of 9/11 , the U.S. government has granted itself far - reaching new powers to spy on you , from email to bank statements to video cameras ( see " Big Brother 's in Your Trash Can , " below ) .
After much debate , we resolved to turn the tables on three of our esteemed public officials .
We embarked on an unauthorized sightseeing tour of their garbage , to make a point about how invasive a " garbage pull " really is -- and to highlight the government 's ongoing erosion of people 's privacy .
We chose District Attorney Mike Schrunk because his office is the most vocal defender of the proposition that your garbage is up for grabs .
We chose Police Chief Mark Kroeker because he runs the bureau .
And we chose Mayor Vera Katz because , as police commissioner , she gives the chief his marching orders .
Each , in his or her own way , has endorsed the notion that you abandon your privacy when you set your trash out on the curb .
So we figured they would n't mind too much if we took a peek at theirs .
Boy , were we wrong .
Perched in his office on the 15th floor of the Justice Center , Chief Kroeker seemed perfectly comfortable with the idea of trash as public property .
" Things inside your house are to be guarded , " he told WW .
" Those that are in the trash are open for trash men and pickers and -- and police .
And so it 's not a matter of privacy anymore . "
Then we spread some highlights from our haul on the table in front of him .
" This is very cheap , " he blurted out , frowning as we pointed out a receipt with his credit - card number , a summary of his wife 's investments , an email prepping the mayor about his job application to be police chief of Los Angeles , a well - chewed cigar stub , and a handwritten note scribbled in pencil on a napkin , so personal it made us cringe .
We also drew his attention to a newsletter from the conservative political advocacy group Focus on the Family , addressed to " Mr. & Mrs. Mark Kroeker . "
" Are you a member of Focus on the Family ? " we asked .
" No , " the chief replied .
" Is your wife ? "
" You know , " he said , with a Clint Eastwood gaze , " it 's none of your business . "
As we explained our thinking , the chief , who is usually polite to a fault , cut us off in midsentence .
" OK , " he said , suddenly standing up , " we 're done . "
Hours later , the chief issued a press release complaining that WW had gone through " my personal garbage at my home . "
KATU promptly took to the airwaves declaring , " Kroeker wants Willamette Week to stay out of his garbage . "
If the chief got overheated , the mayor went nuclear .
When we confessed that we had swiped her recycling , she summoned us to her chambers .
" She wants you to bring the trash - - and bring the name of your attorney , " said her press secretary , Sarah Bott .
Actually , we could n't snatch Katz 's garbage , because she keeps it right next to her house , well away from the sidewalk .
To avoid trespassing , we had to settle for a bin of recycling left out front .
The day after our summons , Wednesday , Dec. 18 , we trudged down to City Hall , stack of newsprint in hand .
A gaggle of TV and radio reporters were waiting to greet us , tipped off by high - octane KXL motor - mouth Lars Larson .
We filed into the mayor 's private conference room .
The atmosphere , chilly to begin with , turned arctic when the mayor marched in .
She speared us each with a wounded glare , then hoisted the bin of newspaper and stalked out of the room -- all without uttering a word .
A few moments later , her office issued a prepared statement .
" I consider Willamette Week 's actions in this matter to be potentially illegal and absolutely unscrupulous and reprehensible , " it read .
" I will consider
all my legal options in response to their actions . "
In contrast , DA Mike Schrunk was almost playful when we owned up to nosing through his kitchen scraps .
" Do I have to pay for this week 's garbage collection ? " he joked .
We told Schrunk that we intended to report that his garbage contained mementos of his military service .
" Do n't burn me on that , " he implored .
" The Marine Corps will shoot me ! "
It 's worth emphasizing that our junkaeological dig unearthed no whiff of scandal .
Based on their throwaways , the chief , the DA and the mayor are squeaky - clean , poop - scooping folks whose private lives are beyond reproach .
They emerge from this escapade smelling like -- well , coffee grounds .
But if three moral , upstanding , public - spirited citizens were each chewing their nails about the secrets we might have stumbled on , how the hell should the rest of us be feeling ?
HAUL OF FAME
Decked out in watch caps and rubber gloves , we are kneeling in a freezing garage and cradling our first major discovery - - a five - pound bag of dog poo .
We set it down next to the rest of our haul from District Attorney Mike Schrunk 's trash -- the remains of Thanksgiving turkey , the mounting stack of his granddaughter 's diapers , the bag of dryer lint , the tub of Skippy peanut butter , and the shredded bag of peanut M&Ms .
There is something about poking through someone else 's garbage that makes you feel dirty , and it 's not just the stench and the flies .
Scrap by scrap , we are reverse - engineering a grimy portrait of another human being , reconstituting an identity from his discards , probing into stuff that is absolutely , positively none of our damn business .
It 's one thing to revel in the hallowed tradition of muckraking .
It 's another to get down on your hands and knees and nose through wads of someone else 's Kleenex .
Is this why our parents sent us to college ?
So we could paw through orange peels and ice - cream tubs and half - eaten loaves of bread ?
And yet , there is also something seductive , almost intoxicating , about being a Dumpster detective .
For example , we spot a clothing tag marked " 44 / Regular . "
Then we find half of a torn receipt from Meier & Frank for $ 262.99 .
Then we find the other half , which reads : " MENS SU 3BTN . "
String it together , and we deduce that Schrunk plunked down $ 262.99 for a size - 44 three - button suit at Meier & Frank on Saturday , Nov. 16 , at 9:35 am .
We are getting to know Portland 's top prosecutor from the inside out .
Here 's an empty bottle of Johnnie Walker Black Label .
There 's a pile of castoff duds from his days as a Marine .
Is he going " soft " on terrorism !?
Chinese takeout boxes and junk - food wrappers testify to a busy lifestyle with little time to cook .
A Post - it note even lays bare someone 's arithmetic skills ( the addition is solid , but the long division needs work ) .
Our haul from Mayor Vera Katz is limited to a stack of newsprint from her recycling bin-- her garbage can was well out of reach -- but we assemble several clues to her intellectual leanings .
We find overwhelming evidence that the Mayor reads The Oregonian , The Washington Post National Weekly Edition , U.S. Mayor and the Portland Tribune .
We also stumble across a copy of TV Click in which certain programs have been circled in municipal red .
If we 're not mistaken , the mayor has a special fondness for dog shows , figure skating and The West Wing .
Our inspection of Chief Kroeker 's refuse reveals that he is a scrupulous recycler .
He is also a health nut .
We find
a staggering profusion of health - food containers : fat - free milk cartons , fat - free cereal boxes , cans of milk
chocolate weight - loss shakes , cans of Swanson chicken broth ( " 99 % fat free ! " ) , water bottles , a cardboard box of protein bars , tubs of low - fat cottage cheese , a paper packet of oatmeal , and an article on " How to Live a Long Healthy Life . "
At the same time , we find evidence of rust in the chief 's iron self - discipline : wrappers from See 's chocolate bars , an unopened bag of Doritos , a dozen perfectly edible fun-size Nestle Crunch bars , three empty Coke cans .
We unearth a crate that once contained 12 bottles of Cook 's California sparkling wine , but find no trace of the
bottles themselves .
Is the chief building a pyramid of them on the mantelpiece ?
We stack the crate beside a pair of white children 's socks , a broken pen , the stub of an Excalibur 1066 cigar , burnt toast , a freezer bag of date bars , orange peel , coffee grounds , a cork , an empty film canister ( no weed - - we checked ) , eggshells , Q tips , tissue paper and copious quantities of goo .
We uncrumple a holiday flier from the Hinson Memorial Baptist Church , which contains a handwritten note : " Mark .
Just want you to know one Latin from Manhattan Loves You . "
Invasion of privacy ?
This is a frontal assault , a D - Day , a
Norman Conquest of privacy .
We know the chief 's credit - card number ; we know where he buys his groceries ; we know how much toilet tissue he goes through .
We know whose Christmas cards he has pitched , whose wedding he skipped , whose photo he threw away .
We know what newsletters he gets and how much he 's socked away in the stock market .
We even know he 's thinking about a new car -- and which models he 's considering .
By the time we tag the last item ( a lonesome Christmas tree angel ) , our noses are running and our gloves are black with gunk .
We scrub our hands when we get home .
But we still feel dirty .

Gross Violation Officer Gina
Hoesly has long had less privacy than the average cop , thanks to the Portland Police Bureau 's rumor mill .
Hoesly ( below ) , 34 , has dated rock musicians , other cops and Portland Trail Blazers .
She 's had breast implants and once posed for a photo on a website selling motorcycle gear -- badpig.com -- showing plenty of skin .
In 1996 , she won a $ 20,000 settlement from the bureau in a sexual - harassment claim based on behavior by her co-workers .
But none of that comes close to the scrutiny she received in March , when fellow officers rifled through her garbage .
The evidence they found led to her indictment on charges of possessing ecstasy , cocaine and methamphetamine .
Hoesly , a 13 - year police officer who occasionally was an undercover decoy in police prostitution stings , became the subject of an investigation early this year , when she told police she 'd been assaulted by her ex-boyfriend , Joshua David Rodriguez .
Rodriguez has a history of drug arrests and convictions , and when officers booked him on assault charges , they found meth in his pocket .
Subsequently police began investigating Hoesly , hearing rumors from police informants that she had used drugs .
On March 13 at 2:07 am , narcotics officers Jay Bates and Michael Krantz took her garbage .
The order to do so came from Assistant Chief Andrew Kirkland , who dated Hoesly in the early '90s .
Searching through her trash back at Central Precinct , they found traces of cocaine and methamphetamine , as well as drug paraphernalia .
They also found a bloody tampon .
They sent a piece of the tampon to the state crime lab , where forensics experts tested it for drugs , DNA and , for reasons that remain unclear , semen .
The results of those tests have not been released .
The police did n't seek a search warrant to take Hoesly 's trash because , as the Multnomah County District Attorney 's office conceded , officers did n't at the time have sufficient evidence to convince a judge to issue a warrant .
But once they had drug residue from Hoesly 's trash , officers were able to persuade Judge Dorothy Baker to issue a search warrant for Hoesly 's house .
Inside , they found more paraphernalia and a diary that described apparent drug use .
An indictment was issued in June .
Hoesly , who is currently on medical leave and at the time of her arrest was in the process of medically retiring , pleaded not guilty and hired criminal - defense lawyer Stephen Houze .
Like a Labrador smelling leftover turkey , Houze promptly zeroed in on the grabbing of her garbage .
He argued that under Oregon 's Constitution , privacy rights extend to someone 's trash -- at least until it 's picked up by trash haulers .
The used tampon " goes to the heart of just what an outrageous violation of privacy rights this police search was , " Houze said .
" If the police will do this to a police officer , who wo n't they do it to ? "
Not only that , he said , but if garbage is up for grabs , " There will be identity thieves lining up out there on every garbage day , knowing they can [ take trash ] with impunity . "
The Hoesly case is not unprecedented .
In 1997 , police poked in the trash of David Peters , a star prosecutor for Multnomah County , and found cocaine residue , which was used to obtain a search warrant .
Unlike Hoesly , he was not indicted ; instead , he was fined and allowed to enter court diversion to maintain a clean record .
In a hearing on Dec. 10 , Judge Jean Kerr Maurer agreed with Houze , issuing a ruling that said the cops ' taking of trash was illegal .
Senior Deputy District Attorney Mark McDonnell immediately said his office would challenge the ruling .

Big Brother 's in Your Trash Can
The government is essentially going through your trash every day , says Evan Hendricks , publisher of Privacy Times , a Washington , D.C. , newsletter .
" They just do n't have to get their hands dirty .
In the past 16 months , thanks to measures contained in the Patriot Act , the Homeland Security Act and the creation of the Total Information Awareness office , our government has turned into a bad Oliver Stone movie -- you know , where a cabal of conservative spooks takes over and suddenly Big Brother is in charge .
No longer do the Feds need to meet the evidentiary standard of " probable cause " to initiate an investigation or start amassing information on you .
Nor do they need to show any evidence of a link to terrorism .
All they need to do , in short , is say they find
you suspicious .
They do n't need to tell a judge why .
" This administration really represents a combination of Reaganism and McCarthyism -- though they 're not chasing Communists , they 're chasing people that they call ' terrorists , ' " says Hendricks , who grew up in Portland .
" They 're expanding their power and intimidating people to sort of go along or be afraid of being accused of being soft on terrorism . "
The October 2001 enactment of the USA Patriot Act opened the door to domestic and Internet surveillance , as well as warrantless , covert " sneak and peek " searches .
Then , on Nov. 19 , 2002 , Congress approved the Homeland Security Act , which Sen. Pat Leahy ( D - Vt. ) called the " most severe weakening of the Freedom of Information Act in its 36 - year history . "
The HSA also created the Total Information Awareness office , whose logo , taken from the back of the dollar bill , is of a pyramid with an eye on top , looking down at the globe .
Headed by Iran - Contra co-conspirator Admiral John Poindexter , the agency will " mine " commercial databases , including magazine subscriptions and book purchases , to spy on American citizens .
It plans to use this information to profile likely terrorist supporters ; it also wants to deploy video camera and facial - recognition surveillance systems .
" The Pentagon basically wants to knock down the walls to all private - sector records and plug into them , " says Hendricks .
" And trash is like a microcosm of what you get : the bills people pay , what they buy at the store , the packages they throw out .
The government is proposing more systematic surveillance of databases that have the same information . "
How do they define who is a likely terrorist supporter ?
Sorry , but that 's a secret .
Attorney General John Ashcroft has given federal agencies free rein to reject information requests , with the assurance that his Department of Justice would defend the agencies no matter what .
Civil - liberties advocates point to the inherent danger in granting the government such sweeping power .
Declassified documents have shown myriad abuses by law - enforcement agencies involved in domestic spying in the '60s , '70s and ' 80s , including in Portland .
In 1997 , a Washington , D.C. , police official used video surveillance of people coming and going from a gay bar to try to blackmail married men .
And studies of camera systems in Britain found that they were used to target minorities for increased police attention , while women caught on camera were often targeted for voyeuristic reasons , with male camera operators panning over them for purposes of ogling .
Small wonder that even conservatives such as Rep. Dick Armey , Sen. Charles Grassley and New York Times columnist William Safire are going ballistic .
Attorney General Ashcroft is " out of control , " and the federal government has " no credibility " on protecting individuals ' privacy , said Armey , who has even volunteered to do consulting work for the ACLU on privacy issues upon his retirement .
" You Are a Suspect " was the title of Safire 's Nov. 14 column on the Total Information Awareness program , which he called a " supersnoop 's dream " and a " sweeping theft of privacy rights . "

Joshua 's mother and grandfather recently died from cancer
An eight - year - old boy has been found hanged in his bedroom in Lancashire .
Joshua Aldred was found unconscious by his grandmother in Lytham on Thursday night .
He was taken to hospital in Blackpool but died a short time later .
Joshua 's mother and grandfather had recently died from cancer and his family believe it was a cry for help .
His father Jason Aldred said : " He missed his mother and spoke of her often .
Our very close relationship was of immense support to both of us . "
He said he believed his son only intended to hurt himself , not take his own life .
" A tragic accident at home occurred when Joshua 's sadness at the loss he had experienced at such a young age has resulted in this tragedy , " he said .
" The family are sure he expected to only injure himself slightly and are devastated that this cry for attention resulted in the loss of such a beautiful boy . "
He was a delightful eight - year - old who will be very sadly missed by everyone
School statement A post - mortem examination carried out on Friday showed his death was consistent with hanging .
Family liaison officers from Lancashire Police are now working closely with his relatives .
Mr Aldred added : " Joshua Isaac Aldred was my beautiful son who was so tragically taken from me .
" In his very short life , Joshua had faced the double tragedy of the loss of his mother , Sarah , from breast cancer on 17 March 2008 and his granddad , John , from prostate cancer , on 9 July 2007 .
" Outwardly this loving and happy child , who had a great network of family and friends to support him , coped admirably . "
Pupil support Joshua was a pupil at the independent King Edward VII and Queen Mary School in Lytham St Annes .
A statement posted on the school website said : " We are shocked and saddened by news of the death of Joshua Aldred .
He was a delightful eight - year - old who will be very sadly missed by everyone .
" We are talking to the children and their parents in the preparatory school and are providing support to them .
" Our deepest sympathy goes to Joshua 's father and the rest of his family and we of course respect their rights to privacy at this sad time . "

So if you have n't already , go check out the " Meet the Sniper " vid .
Its Cash Money .
But if you look closely at the Pyro he decapitates , hes holding a strange new weapon .
My panel of experts has come to the agreement that it is most likely a weighted projectile launcher , similar to that of a flare gun or blunderbuss .
We can only speculate as to what it fires , but our hopes are a short range napalm grenade that can bounce one or two times before exploding a small area into purifying flame !!!!!
Discuss .

77 Year - Old Granny Beats Up Italian Soldiers
We know Asian women are able to keep their looks as they age , but their strength as well ?
Keiko Wakabayshi , also known as the â€œSamurai Grannyâ€ was hired by the Italian army to teach new soldiers hand to hand combat techniques .
But if you think that she is only teaching the methods rather than putting them into practice , think again .
The 77 year old grandmother wipes the floor with her recruits , beating them up on a daily basis with the hopes that they will one day be able to learn the techniques themselves .
Since sparring is the best way to learn how to put martial arts into practice , Keiko is â€œforcedâ€ to take down her students one by one until they have learned to counter her attacks and master her techniques .
Not many soldiers believed that any Japanese women were going to be able to beat up the entire Italian army , let alone one a grandmother in her late 70’s , but their doubt was quickly turned into humiliation as their faces were thrown against the floor .

Grant - this one ’s for you .
I would go into more depth but somehow it got really long already … .
Why Porn ?
I got into porn because I just ca n’t seem to grasp this elusive idea we ’ve all been socialized to conform to about how women should behave .
I ca n’t buy into this Madonna / Whore complex .
I got into porn because I can’t seem to understand how it has become more virtuous for a woman to throw her entire life away on one man in exchange for security and social standing .
We have one life to live and women are taught to give all that up on a marriage to the “ right man ” , a man who she is not supposed to test out sexually , who may change down the line , who will ultimately be the biggest factor in her happiness .
Women are taught to hold out and not give up their prized virginity until they get their asking price , but the women who give and take freely of sex and truly enjoy themselves are pushed into the gutter and ultimately are the ones who are called whores .
Rather than commit to a lifelong pact and an uncertain future , why are n’t women socialized to enjoy their bodies and secure their own resources and create their own social standing ?
Why are n’t women taught to take charge of their happiness ?
Should n’t a woman who does this be the one who is respected rather than the weak ones whose only accomplishment in life is the male they managed to tie down or be tied down by ?
I know times have changed and it is much less common for women to actually wait until marriage , but this is still the ideal .
Mothers will still brag if their daughters conform to this and daughters still lie to their mothers .
I got into porn because I like money , and the idea that wealth or success is bad will never resonate with me .
The people who call material wealth a character flaw are the same people who ask for hand downs and expect others to give away freely what they ’ve earned ( yet ironically do n’t want sex given freely ) .
The people who criticize material wealth are never the people who have material wealth .
They are the ones who for whatever reason chose not to capitalize on their potential .
I will not allow these people to make me feel like I am somehow less virtuous than them .
Material wealth is a measure of success .
It is a gauge for how well you ’ve applied your resources .
Economically the best thing I can do right now is porn , and I ’m not ashamed of that .
The dollar amount I make in porn is very high compared to the dollar amount one would pull in from an average job with a good education .
Being in porn has nothing to do with an inability to do anything else and everything to do with a very simple economic rule : profit maximization .
I ’m interested in a future that is financially stable and will remain so independent of anyone else .
I got into porn because I know the value of money .
I know that $ 10,000 invested starting at age 14 is worth close to 1.2 million at age 65 with an annual return of 10 % .
$ 16,000 invested starting at 19 with the same rate of return is only worth about one million by age 65 .
And $ 78,000 invested starting at age 27 is only worth about .8 million by then .
I got into porn because I want the biggest return for the hours I put in .
My time is important to me and I am not willing to trade it for less than I can get in porn .
I got into porn because I cannot stand monotony .
I do not want to throw my energy into anything that does n’t change day to day and does n’t allow me to build something .
I got into porn because even when I ’m working I ’m doing the things I want to be doing while I ’m young .
I ’m traveling , I ’m going to school , I ’m learning about the real world , and I still have the time and money to enjoy that nagging horse habit I have .
I got into porn because I feel like I ’m giving up the least while gaining the most .
I got into porn because for some reason I just do n’t understand what is “ wrong ” with porn outside of social constructs .
I understand what the social constructs are , I just do n’t understand why as a nation we still buy into them .
When people try to explain it to me it feels like they are holding a sheer curtain in front of the argument and as hard as I try I ca n’t help but see straight through it .
I ca n’t see how sex is bad .
I ca n’t see how enjoying sex is bad .
I ca n’t see how sex can only be enjoyed when under the influence of a certain emotional state .
Sex has huge mental components , yes , but at the end of the day it is a physical act and the orgasm is a physical response .
I ca n’t see how liking different kinds of sex is bad .
I ca n’t see how fetishes are harmful .
I ca n’t understand why women have to be abused as children in order to like a little exhibitionism or S&M .
I think these boundaries are all specific to the individual and should stop where the comfort level stops for all involved .
I got into porn because it is some of the greatest real world education I will get .
Where else , at age 22 , will I learn how to network and manage myself the way I do here ?
There are so many subtleties in this industry .
Most of them I did n’t even see for the first year .
I ’m guessing there are many more that I ’m not even aware of yet .
At age 22 , what other industry is going to give me the green light on running my own business ?
Because that is what these websites are .
They are small businesses and the girls who get them going and keep them running are small business owners .
College does not provide this kind of instruction .
College will provide theory only and I want both .
I intend to run a much larger business someday .
I got into porn because I really do like the sex .
There is a rush that still has n’t gone away when I have sex on a set .
There is a rush in talking about it .
There is something very carnal that takes over when I see men like the ones I work with .
I ’m always asked what my biggest fantasy is in interviews and I have a hard time articulating it .
For me , there is nothing like fucking a man for the sheer purpose of fucking him .
There is nothing like seeing a person that I consider to be completely male and just experiencing him in that way .
I will get off on the way his muscles move when he grabs me .
I will get off on his jaw line .
I will get off on him getting off on me .
That is what I fantasize about .
I did not get into porn because of a strict background , or because of abuse .
Even if I had been a victim as a child I would not let myself simply be bounced around today .
I refuse to let choices be made for me .
I also refuse to let anti-porn comments hurt me personally , because I believe that the final result should not be focused on so much as the reasoning behind it .
When I do hear anti-porn comments , I look for the reasoning behind them and the reasoning usually crumbles .
I think it is ironic that sex is in the gutter but our arguments have more merit .
I think it is ironic that sex workers are in the gutter but we are more honest with ourselves than those passing judgment .
Generally I think it is ironic that American culture is more backwards about sex than most of the western world as we try to hold our footing as self appointed leaders on the world stage .
Mostly , I think it is strange that with the substantial amount of money porn stars make they are still asked why they do it .
A Cross -Browser , Bookmarklet Speed Reader
Yesterday , via both Digg and Reddit , I came upon Spreeder , a wonderful speed reading app .
However , it has a major drawback .
To use the application , you actually have to perform the speed reading on spreeder.com , taking you away from the page you need .
You can either cut - and - paste content into their application , or use their bookmarklet that redirects you to their site after highlighting the text you want to read .
So , I took a few minutes to cobble together this app , which I think is a lot easier to use and far more simple .
It is also cross - browser compliant for FireFox , Opera and Safari , no luck in IE as of yet .
Just simply drag the link below to your browser ’s bookmark bar .
Then , when you want to speed read your favorite blog or magazine article , just highlight the text on the page , and then press the bookmarklet .
It will pop the speed reader up right there in front of you , and help you read at a full 300 words per minute !
Click and hold on the link below and drag it up to the bookmark bar
If you click and release , the whole thing will be ruined .
Just kidding , but it will look weird , because WordPress screws up the bookmarklet so I have to put it in the iframe below .

( CNN ) --
A massive tornado tore into the northern Colorado town of Windsor and nearby towns Thursday , killing one person and damaging many homes and businesses , the town 's mayor said .
The storm struck the town of Windsor and " several other areas " of Weld County , a fire spokeswoman says .

" It will be a long time before the town recovers from this , " Windsor Mayor John Vasquez said .
The funnel cloud , accompanied by golf - ball sized hail , blackened the skies over Windsor as it knocked down power lines , shredded crops in fields outside the city and blasted whole neighborhoods .
The southeast side of town was hit the worst by the storm , which began around noon , Vasquez said .
Windsor , with a population of nearly 19,000 , is about 80 miles ( 130 km ) north of Denver .
Colorado Gov. Bill Ritter ordered the National Guard to aid rescue and cleanup efforts .
He visited the town Thursday evening , saying the number of homes damaged was significant .
" There are places where it looks like the entire roof is missing and places where the wall and part of the roof is missing , " he said .

More than 100 children escaped injury when the staff at Windmill Child Enrichment Center hustled them into an interior room as the storm approached , Kristi Bernhardt , the center 's director , told CNN .

Rough weather also affected communities in western Colorado .
Rising waters prompted authorities to close a 12 - mile stretch of I - 70 near Grand Junction a few hours after the tornado struck Windsor , about 220 miles away .
Power was out across town , and about 100 people were taking shelter at a local recreation center , he said .
Vasquez said firefighters and utility crews were working to cap ruptured gas lines .
The single fatality reported was at a campground at a park outside Windsor , near the city of Greeley , he said .
Authorities had no count of injuries .
Earlier , Weld County Sheriff 's Cmdr. Ken Poncelow said more than 100 homes could be damaged .
Watch an enormous funnel cloud move in quickly »
" Some are completely demolished and unrecognizable -- just masses of timber , " said Scott Scofield , a Weld County deputy .
CNN confirmed that another tornado touched down in Laramie , Wyoming , hitting a high school , a middle school , a Wal - Mart store and houses .
In Fort Collins , Colorado , the Larimer County Sheriff 's Office had several reports of damage , including one home destroyed and another in which residents were trapped by a fallen tree , spokesman Don Nadow said .
Witnesses also reported funnel clouds over parts of Loveland , about 13 miles south of Fort Collins , he said .
Several power outages were reported because of downed power lines , but there were no reports of injuries in Larimer County , said Capt .
Steve Fleming of the Poudre Fire Authority .
Inspector Dan Engelhardt , a Loveland Fire Department spokesman , said multiple funnel clouds had been reported in that area and several touched down .
Loveland and other area fire departments have contributed engine companies and rescue teams to Windsor , he said .
Windsor , Fort Collins and Loveland lie in the shadow of the Rocky Mountains , where the Great Plains give way to steep hills .
" It 's very unusual to see this by a mountain range .
It 's kind of a freak thing , " Fleming said .
The storm , moving northwest , dissipated quickly after the tornado struck .
But watches and warnings remained posted for northeastern Colorado .
Later Thursday night , KABC in Los Angeles , California , reported that a tornado warning was issued for west central Riverside County .
March Air Reserve Base near Moreno Valley was closed and its control tower was evacuated after multiple twisters were spotted .
A big-rig truck was overturned and a train was derailed , reportedly by a tornado moving across Riverside County , the CNN affiliate reported .
CNN Meteorologist Chad Myers contributed to this report .

Barack Obama to “ Refine ” His Iraq War Withdrawal Promise
Oh the ever changing positions of Barack Obama , they will make your head spin .
Barack Obama promised the far left that he would begin withdrawing troops from Iraq immediately upon his inauguration and that all troops would be home within 16 months after he became president .
Now he is saying that he will “ refine ” his position and may not bring the troops home even as he still promises to bring them home .
I know I am writing in knots ( if that makes any sense either ) but Barack Obama twists and turns in the wind so much that it is hard to keep track of any of his various stances on the issues .
I ’ve always said that the pace of withdrawal would be dictated by the safety and security of our troops and the need to maintain stability , ” he said .
“ That assessment has not changed .
And when I go to Iraq and have a chance to talk to some of the commanders on the ground , I ’m sure I ’ll have more information and will continue to refine my policies
So now he will meet with the people who actually know what is going on and “ refine ” his position ?
Needless to say this flip - flop on ending the war regardless of what the people on the ground say has infuriated the far left .
Obama ’s base .
He had to “ clarify ” his statement about refining his Iraq war position just a few hours later .
“ We ’re going to try this again , ” Obama said .
“ Apparently , I was n’t clear enough this morning on my position with respect to the war in Iraq . ”
“ Let me be as clear as I can be , ” he said .
“ I intend to end this war .
My first day in office , I will bring the Joint Chiefs of Staff in , and I will give them a new mission , and that is to end this war – responsibly , deliberately , but decisively .
And I have seen no information that contradicts the notion that we can bring our troops out safely at a pace of one to two brigades a month , and again , that pace translates into having our combat troops out in 16 months ’ time . ”
He took both sides of the issue in a matter of hours to try to please everybody , hoping nobody would call him out .
And they wo n’t , Barack Obama gets a free pass on all of his flip - flops by the mainstream media .
This is no exception .
Why else would he so blatantly tell two different groups two different things within hours of each other ?
The media is not doing their job .
Obama skates on issue like this .
People were foolish to believe that Barack Obama was just going to pull the troops out of Iraq as soon as he became president , but they did .
So now Obama is trying to break the news to them that he will not be able to deliver on this promise , even as he is still promising to withdraw from Iraq .
The man is shameless , the voters are blind , and the media is incompetent .
It makes for a scary situation .
The problem is that we are winning a war that Obama had hoped we would have lost by know and he is having trouble dealing with it .
Just give us your position Barack , how can you be trusted to lead if you just try to capitulate to everybody ?
Sometimes leadership means making some people unhappy .
Grow a set and stick to a position , and then live or die with that position .

It has been over 50 years since the discovery of the double - stranded nature of DNA , and over that half - century and more we have learned a lot about deoxyribonucleic acid , from the fact that it organizes into a double - stranded double helix all the way to having sequenced the entire DNA of humans and a range of other organisms .
Now , according to a paper published in the Journal of the American Chemical Society , a team in Japan has created the world 's first DNA strand made from artificial bases .
As information storage systems go , DNA is not bad .
Just four different bases ( adenine , thymine , guanine , and cytosine ) are all that 's needed to code for 20 different amino acids , using three base codons ( e.g. AUG ) .
In fact , the four - base , triplet codon system has the potential to be able to store information for more than just 20 amino acids ; there are 64 potential combinations , so several amino acids have multiple codons , along with three stop codons that tell the cellular machinery involved that the sequence is done .
Along the way , people have looked at DNA and thought that it ought to be possible to use DNA to store nonbiological data .
Better still , it can pack that information into far smaller packages than is possible with solid state memory or even the densest hard drive platters .
There have also been experiments that use DNA sequences to perform parallel processing , as we covered last year .
But we need n't be limited to the four complementary bases , and that 's just what has been shown by a Japanese team , who have published details of their creation of an artificial DNA strand .
All the components of their DNA product are nonnatural , yet they spontaneously form right - handed duplexes with the corresponding opposite base , and these bonds have very similar properties to those of natural DNA .
The hope is that this artificial DNA could have a range of applications in the real world , from the aforementioned DNA computing proposals , along with using DNA to store data , to using it in nanotech settings .
Artificial DNA has similar physical properties to common - or - garden DNA without being degraded by enzymes such as DNase ( which is found everywhere ) , a factor that would make it quite useful for any kind of biomedical setting .

Kucinich impeach bill charges Bush ' fabricated threats ' ; Pelosi hints at possible hearing Mike Sheehan and Nick Juliano
Published : Thursday July 10 , 2008
Print This Email This Concerned that the 35 articles of impeachment he introduced a month ago might be too much for members of the House Judiciary Committee to handle all at once , Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D - OH ) simplified things Thursday .
The former Democratic presidential candidate introduced a single article to impeach President Bush , accusing him of deceiving Congress to convince lawmakers to authorize his invasion of Iraq more than five years ago .
" Yesterday in the House , we had a moment of silence for the troops , " Kucinich said during a Capitol Hill press conference .
" Today it is time to speak out on behalf of those troops who will be in Iraq for at least another year , courageously representing our nation while their Commander - in - Chief sent them on a mission that was based on falsehoods about the threat of WMDs from Iraq . "
Kucinich spoke outside a House office building with the Capitol dome gleaming behind him as he distributed to news organizations , including RAW STORY , the text of his impeachment article .
Its title : " Deceiving Congress with Fabricated Threats of Iraq WMDs to Fraudulently Obtain Support for an Authorization of the Use of Military Force Against Iraq . "
Surrounded by reporters as well as supporters from activist group Code Pink , Kucinich said he was " grateful " for House Speaker Nancy Pelosi 's suggestion that the Judiciary Committee may soon hold hearings on his measure .
" Like everything else in Washington , never say never , " Kucinich said of the possibility for action on an impeachment measure Pelosi long said was " off the table . "
Watch it :
Kucinich said he would move to refer the single impeachment article to the Judiciary Committee either on Monday or Tuesday of next week .
His primary concern , he said , is that he be able to testify on the contents of the measure to the committee .
" Throughout the summer and fall of 2002 , the Congress , the media and the American people heard the terrifying drumbeat of fear from the Bush White House in the form of loud , well - advertised and orchestrated chanting by the President and his Administration about ' Weapons of Mass Destruction , ' ' Nuclear Threats , ' ' Biological Weapons , ' ' Chemical Weapons , ' ' Threats of Imminent Attack , ' all calculated to gain media attention , public support and Congressional support for a war against Iraq , " Kucinich said earlier in the conference .
The failure of Congress to hold the president accountable with the most severe tool it has available -- impeachment -- is very disconcerting , he said .
" There 's a deep concern that the American people have about the institution of Congress , " Kucinich emphasized .
In June , Kucinich presented 35 articles of impeachment to Congress , but that effort has been stalled in the Judiciary Committee .
Kucinich 's article focuses on " what the President presented to Congress in the Authorization of the Use of Military Force .
It does not address the voluminous evidence of orchestrated deceptions which have been well documented by various governmental , non-governmental and media sources .
" I understand that many members of Congress voted in good faith to authorize the use of force against Iraq , " Kucinich said , " and I understand that many in the media supported that action .
When the President of the United States makes representations on matters of life and death , we all want to believe him and give him the benefit of the doubt .
Trust is the glue which holds the fabric of our nation together .
" Those in Congress and in the media who acted on the President 's representations of the threat of Iraq WMDs did so trusting that those representations were honest .
Unfortunately , they were not . "
He continued , " We all know the consequences of the war , the loss of lives and injury to our troops , the deaths of innocent Iraqis , the cost to the American taxpayers .
There has been another consequence : Great damage to our Constitution through an unnecessary , illegal war and the destruction of the superior role of Congress in the life of this nation .
" Congress must , " Kucinich asserted , " in the name of the American people , use the one remedy which the Founders provided for an Executive who gravely abused his power : Impeachment .
" Congress must reassert itself as a co-equal branch of government ; bring this President to an accounting , and in doing so reestablish the people 's trust in Congress and in our United States system of government .
We must not let this President 's conduct go unchallenged and thereby create a precedent which undermines the Constitution .
He continued , " In the final analysis this is about our Constitution and whether a President can be held accountable for his actions and his deceptions , especially when the effects of those actions have been so calamitous for America , Iraq and the world .
" Unless Congress reasserts itself as the power branch of government which the Founders intended , our experiment with a republican form of Government may be nearing an end , " Kucinich said in closing .
" But when Congress acts to hold this President accountable it will be redeeming the faith that the Founders had in the power of a system of checks and balances which preserves our republic . "
The impeachment measure , Kucinich insisted , was not motivated simply out of distaste for President Bush .
It 's about protecting the Constitution , keeping balance between the branches of government and making sure the next president does not abuse his power as this one has , he said .
" This Constitution is what the President of the United States takes an oath to defend , " Kucinich said .
" He has n't done that . "
Following is an excerpted version of the draft of the impeachment article as issued by Kucinich .
The complete bill is available at AfterDowningStreet ... # AN ARTICLE OF IMPEACHMENT OF PRESIDENT GEORGE W. BUSH INTRODUCED BY CONGRESSMAN DENNIS J. KUCINICH JULY 10 , 2008 Resolved , that President George W. Bush be impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors , and that the following Article of Impeachment be exhibited to the United States Senate :
An Article of Impeachment exhibited by the House of Representatives of the United States of America in the name of itself and of the people of the United States of America , in maintenance and support of its impeachment against President George W. Bush for high crimes and misdemeanors .
ARTICLE ONE DECEIVING CONGRESS WITH FABRICATED THREATS OF IRAQ WMDs TO FRAUDULENTLY OBTAIN SUPPORT FOR AN AUTHORIZATION OF THE USE OF MILITARY FORCE AGAINST IRAQ .
In his conduct while President of the United States , George W. Bush , in violation of his constitutional oath to faithfully execute the office of President of the United States and , to the best of his ability , preserve , protect , and defend the Constitution of the United States , and in violation of his constitutional duty under Article II , Section 3 of the Constitution " to take care that the laws be faithfully executed , " deceived Congress with fabricated threats of Iraq Weapons of Mass Destruction ( WMD ) to fraudulently obtain support for an authorization for the use of force against Iraq and used that fraudulently obtained authorization , then acting in his capacity under Article II , Section II of the Constitution as Commander in Chief , to commit US troops to combat in Iraq .

A woman who became a victim of a stroke , recovered from the disease speaking with a strange accent .
This is one of the rare cases when a person starts speaking with a new " foreign " accent called foreign accent syndrome ( FAS ) .
Rose Dore , a 52 year - old woman lives with her family in southern Ontario .
After she started recovering from a stroke , her family realized that she was speaking differently .
For example , she pronounced certain words quite strangely like " tink " for " think " , or " dat " for " that " , " diss " for " this " , " gracey " instead of " greasy " and " rogue " instead of " dog " .
Scientists at McMaster ’s Cognitive Science of Language program say that the rare condition often results from the neurological damage in certain brain areas .
Rose Dore 's new accent resembles Newfoundlander 's one , characteristic for the East Coast .
Interestingly , the woman had never visited that region and never had any contacts with anyone from the Maritimes .
Her parents were Irish and Danish and both always lived in southern Ontario .
The woman herself did not seem to notice that she speaks differently , the researchers said .
Her speech sounds absolutely normal and nobody thinks that she suffered from a stroke .
Taking into account that often strokes result in language loss , the woman 's new accent is considered to be a very good outcome .
There were around fifty cases of foreign accent syndrome recorded in the last 60 years with a lot of cases going unreported .
The study was published in the July issue of the Canadian Journal of Neurological Sciences .

As many of you will by now know , on 23 July 2008 , N Robin Crossby , the creator of Hârn , HârnMaster and the universe of Keléstia , passed on to Yàsháin .
Robin had been suffering from liposarcoma or fat - cell - cancer in his bowel that was discovered in January 2006 .
He underwent surgery followed by chemotherapy , and was briefly in remission in 2007 .
Robin is survived by his wife Sharon , his three daughters , his three siblings , his father and many friends all over the world .
All of us will miss him dearly .
We will miss his wit and humour , his brilliance , his particular perspective on the worlds , his ( sometimes maddening ) attention to detail , his song , his love of his creation and his dedication to his vision .
Robin began to create the world of Hârn over three decades ago , and brought it to the public in 1983 .
Over the years he worked with many people to bring his vision to fruition .
His chief love was map making , and his maps of Hârn and other places are renowned .
Robin was a perfectionist , and constantly strove to reach the unobtainable - the perfection of his vision .
He was never satisfied with his own work , always striving to improve it , to come closer to his vision .
His goal was to make Kèthîra , the world of Hârn , as real a place as he could for his friends and fans all over the world .
Many people shared and continue to share his love of Hârn and thus part of his vision .
Robin was the Creator of Hârn , and the founder of Keléstia Productions .
He can't and wo n't be replaced , but his legacy will live on .
Robin made it clear that it was his desire for Keléstia
Productions to continue working towards perfecting our reflection of his vision .
Those of us who have been working with him these last few years plan to honour that wish as best as we are able .
" Kua hinga te Totara " - " A great Totara has fallen " .
" The stars of the heaven are dimmed ; darkness is over all .
Our treasured bird has flown ; the giant tree of the forest
that sheltered the birds and the small has fallen to the earth .
The midpost of the house has snapped asunder ;
the chill wind blows through the afflicted home .
Our friend is gone ; borne away on the canoe of Fate .
He passes along the viewless path by which so many have gone before " .

LOWER THE FLAGS ALONG WALL STREET TO HALF - STAFF .
Play a dirge and hang out the crepe .
Market capitalism is dead .
Our financial system , for all intents and purposes , has been federalized , with taxpayer - financed " backstops " stretching as far the eye can see .
Bear Stearns , Freddie Mac ( ticker : FRE ) , Fannie Mae ( FNM ) and their mortgage - industry brothers - in - ARMs all are beneficiaries of this corporate - welfare scheme .
Other reckless lenders with sob stories almost certainly will be added to the list .
What is hard to digest is that the government 's " bailout " of Fannie , Freddie and the rest of the housing market has elicited barely a whimper of protest from the famed financial district , a place that once proudly billed itself as the free - market capital of the world .
Nor has there been a plausible peep from our two presidential candidates about this blow to the American way .
Wall Street -- the proud , powerful and symbolic American landmark that Osama bin Laden repeatedly has vowed to destroy -- used to be about the invisible hand , risks and rewards , and the late economist Joseph Schumpeter 's " creative destruction . "
It was creative , alright .
Now the incubator of financial innovation turns out to be part wax works , a place where dead companies are made to look life - like by the very visible hand of the government .
Move over , Madame Tussaud .
Make room for Treasury Secretary Hank Paulson and Federal Reserve Chairman Ben Bernanke .
Their intention is to protect the financial system from a far larger catastrophe .
But Paulson and Bernanke inadvertently are leading us to a place from which countries like Sweden are desperate to escape : a land called Socialism .
History has demonstrated here and abroad that once you start down this slippery slope , it is extremely hard to reverse direction .
Welfare dependence among the poor was a pathology that endured for 30 years until President Bill Clinton ended open - ended handouts .
Expect our bankers to be just as reluctant to get off the dole as were the beneficiaries of those handouts .
Among the many ironies here , Paulson and Bernanke were appointed by George Bush , our very first MBA president , who seems uninterested in the credit - market catastrophe and its ramifications , and only too happy to delegate the stressful job of shoring up a collapsing economy to his more experienced minions .
As far as we can tell , he took no 3 a.m. phone calls from Paulson when the Fannie and Freddie started to topple a few weekends ago .
The poor man !
With just a few months left in office , Bush sees leg after leg falling from under his legacy .
He was a uniter , not a divider .
He was going to fix Social Security .
He was going to cut spending and shrink government , not run up the deficit .
And he was going to liberate Iraq , not occupy it .
His lofty goals have morphed into bitter disappointments .
He 's become a real - life Charlie Brown , all tangled up in his kite string .
Until recently , the economy was the president 's most enduring achievement .
It miraculously survived and prospered through the Sept. 11 attacks , monster hurricanes , a major war -- a resiliency Bush attributes , correctly in my opinion , to his tax cuts .
The economy is still managing to grow despite oil - price and commodity shocks and the bursting of a spectacular investment bubble .
But the economic growth is subpar and has been sustained by a debased currency and extraordinary efforts such as stimulus checks and the recent corporate " backstops , " administration - speak for bailouts .
A " Mission Accomplished " banner just wo n't serve as a credible backdrop here .
Even more ironic , Paulson and Bernanke are being egged on by Wall Street brokers and bankers who may well be the children and grandchildren of the same Elephant plutocrats who denounced Franklin Delano Roosevelt 's New Deal 70 years ago as a pinko plot .
They 've encouraged big government to solve our most pressing problems .
The backstops now are a political problem for the GOP , which no longer can castigate Democrats for pitching big - government solutions to most of our problems .
If the Democrats win in November , as pollsters are predicting , there will be no credible opposition to : government - run health care ; a tax system that redistributes wealth rather than raising essential revenue ; and a command - and - control " green - power " industry , or the born - again prohibitionists who this time will take their axes to the oil barrel , sparing the contents of the whiskey barrel as a fuel resource for your car .
If you expect a spirited defense of free - market capitalism from Republican hopeful John McCain , look elsewhere .
McCain recently said he does n't believe General Motors ( GM ) needs a government bailout , but if conditions worsen enough for the auto maker , all options need to be considered .
R.I.P. free market , at least on this side of the Pacific .
Update 01/2009 : this post is still valid , but see updated installation instructions here .
Last night at the Python user group I gave a short demo on using Emacs as a Python editor / IDE .
My macbook pro refused to display on the projector so I thought my demo was going to be a ' no go ' .
Thankfully , sontek allowed me to use his Linux laptop .
I hurriedly copied over my emacs environment , installed a few packages and was able to present after all .
I think the demo went fairly well even though I think it was a bit hurried and I forgot to cover a few things , I think I was pretty nervous at the same time because of the fact that the mac did n't work and got me flustered .
Oh well , I think people enjoyed it .
My Emacs Environment
Below are the Emacs features most applicable to Python development :
Rope and Ropemacs Rope is a general ( non-emacs specific ) Python IDE library .
It has awesome support for multiple refactoring methods and code introspection .
Inside Emacs , this gives us : Full ( working ! ! ) code - completion support of modules , classes , methods etc. ( M-/ and M-? )
Instant documentation for element under the cursor ( C- c d ) Jump to module / class / method definition of element under the cursor ( C - c g ) .
This works for any Python code it finds in your PYTHONPATH , including things from the stdlib .
Refactoring of code ( like rename -- C-c r r )
List all occurences of of a name in your entire project and More .
YASnippet YASnippet is a snippet tool like TextMate .
You can expand user defined keywords into whole blocks of predefined code .
This is especially useful for the usual boilerplate that would go into a python file like #!/usr / bin/env python and if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : Granted , Python does n't require much boilerplate , and therefore this package is much more suited to languages like Java , but I bring it up because I think its cool and if you get into the habit of using it , then a few keystrokes saved here and there will add up over time .
and Subversion support with psvn.el Psvn is a comprehensive subversion client for Emacs .
It integrates well with ediff mode so you can use it to check changes between versions .
It does all of the other boring subversion stuff well too .
Ido - mode for buffer switching and file opening .
Emacs , to the uninitiated , can be confusing because by default there is only one view into a single file at a time .
How does one get to another file ?
Instead of cluttering the interface with GUIness and making the user click somewhere ( and thereby forcing the user to waste their time by moving their hand off of the keyboard ) , Emacs gives powerful ways to switch between files .
Ido - mode is one of these useful ways -- it makes a list of open files starting with the most frequently visted files and widdles this list down as you type part of the filename .
You can have dozens of files open and only be a few keystrokes away from any one of them .
A lot of people , for whatever reason , do n't feel that Emacs is an IDE at all .
I do n't personally care what you define it as -- the fact remains -- Emacs is a powerful Python environment and despite being over 32 years old has proven to be just as modern as any IDE today , and remains THE most configurable editor ( operating system ? ) ever .
I 've tarred up my Emacs environment for general consumption .
Instructions :
Install Pymacs
Install Rope and Ropemacs
BTW , those three packages should be the only packages other than Emacs you 'll need .
Everything else is self contained .
Extract the tarball to your home directory .
This creates a directory called ryan- emacs-env .
Rename " ryan-emacs -env " to " .emacs . d "
Symlink my dot - emacs file to your .emacs .
Run " ln -s .emacs.d/dot-emacs .emacs " .
If you also want to do Java development run " tar xfvz jde - 2.3.5.1.tar.gz " .
I leave it tarred because you do n't need to pollute your environment if you 're not going to use Java .
( Also for whatever reason , jde does n't like to be stuck in my subversion repository so I just leave it tarred up and untar on every machine I check it out on . )
Extra tips :
Put your .emacs.d directory under version control .
Never rely on your distros emacs packages , install all future elisp files yourself in your .emacs.d file and commit to your repository often .
This way you 've got an environment that is easily transportable and synchronizable across multiple machines .
This is the major reason why my emacs environment was so fast to trasnfer from my macbook pro to sontek 's laptop during the demo .
Speaking of sontek , he brought up an excellent point in #utahpython the other day , he 's not going to be using my emacs environment except for reference , instead he 's starting with a clean slate .
This is by far the best and most prudent thing to do .
My emacs environment is a culmination of several years of plugging in and deleting various packages and writing various snippets of elisp .
Your needs are always going to be different than mine and you are also going to be better off by educating yourself along the way by creating your own .
Some more fun Emacs evangelism :
Chinese Cyber Attacks
The popular media conception is that there is a coordinated attempt by the Chinese government to hack into U.S. computers — military , government corporate — and steal secrets .
The truth is a lot more complicated .
There certainly is a lot of hacking coming out of China .
Any company that does security monitoring sees it all the time .
These hacker groups seem not to be working for the Chinese government .
They do n’t seem to be coordinated by the Chinese military .
They ’re basically young , male , patriotic Chinese citizens , trying to demonstrate that they ’re just as good as everyone else .
As well as the American networks the media likes to talk about , their targets also include pro-Tibet , pro-Taiwan , Falun Gong and pro-Uyghur sites .
The hackers are in this for two reasons : fame and glory , and an attempt to make a living .
The fame and glory comes from their nationalistic goals .
Some of these hackers are heroes in China .
They ’re upholding the country ’s honor against both anti-Chinese forces like the pro-Tibet movement and larger forces like the United States .
And the money comes from several sources .
The groups sell owned computers , malware services , and data they steal on the black market .
They sell hacker tools and videos to others wanting to play .
They even sell T - shirts , hats and other merchandise on their Web sites .
This is not to say that the Chinese military ignores the hacker groups within their country .
Certainly the Chinese government knows the leaders of the hacker movement and chooses to look the other way .
They probably buy stolen intelligence from these hackers .
They probably recruit for their own organizations from this self - selecting pool of experienced hacking experts .
They certainly learn from the hackers .
And some of the hackers are good .
Over the years , they have become more sophisticated in both tools and techniques .
They ’re stealthy .
They do good network reconnaissance .
My guess is what the Pentagon thinks is the problem is only a small percentage of the actual problem .
And they discover their own vulnerabilities .
Earlier this year , one security company noticed a unique attack against a pro-Tibet organization .
That same attack was also used two weeks earlier against a large multinational defense contractor .
They also hoard vulnerabilities .
During the 1999 conflict over the two - states theory conflict , in a heated exchange with a group of Taiwanese hackers , one Chinese group threatened to unleash multiple stockpiled worms at once .
There was no reason to disbelieve this threat .
If anything , the fact that these groups are n’t being run by the Chinese government makes the problem worse .
Without central political coordination , they ’re likely to take more risks , do more stupid things and generally ignore the political fallout of their actions .
In this regard , they ’re more like a non -state actor .
So while I ’m perfectly happy that the U.S. government is using the threat of Chinese hacking as an impetus to get their own cybersecurity in order , and I hope they succeed , I also hope that the U.S. government recognizes that these groups are not acting under the direction of the Chinese military and does n’t treat their actions as officially approved by the Chinese government .

The body 's " feeding clock " may over - ride our natural sleep cycles Adjusting meal times can help travellers recover from jet lag , a study suggests .
Harvard University researchers believe the brain has a second " feeding clock " which keeps track of meal - times , rather than daytime , after studying mice .
When food is scarce , the feeding clock overrides the master clock , keeping animals awake until they find food .
Thus , shift workers and travellers can keep tiredness at bay by not eating , they suggest in the journal Science .
Our daily sleep cycles , behaviour and metabolism are governed by a powerful master clock , which resides in an area of the brain known as the suprachiasmatic nucleus .
It 's never going to make the symptoms of jet lag disappear entirely , but it could certainly make them a lot more manageable
Dr Neil Stanley , of Norwich University Hospital Disruption of these " circadian " rhythms have been shown to be linked with insomnia , depression , heart disease , cancer and neurodegenerative disorders .
This " circadian " clock is highly sensitive to daylight .
But scientists have for several years been aware of a second " feeding " clock which is sensitive to our eating patterns .
To understand the relationship between the two clocks , a Harvard team studied mice which were missing a key clock gene , Bmal1 .
By restoring this gene to different parts of the brain , one at a time , they were able to pinpoint the " feeding clock " to an area of the hypothalamus known as the dorsomedial nucleus .
What is more , by observing the mice 's behaviour , they found that the " feeding clock " could supersede the circadian master clock , keeping the mice awake until they had the opportunity to eat .
Beneficial Lead researcher Clifford Saper suggested travellers and shift workers may be able to use the feeding clock to adapt to changes in time zones and night - time schedules which leave them feeling groggy and jet - lagged .
" If , for example , you are travelling from the US to Japan , you are forced to adjust to an 11 - hour time difference .
" Because the body 's biological clock can only shift a small amount each day , it takes the average person about a week to adjust to the new time zone .
" And , by then , it 's often time to turn around and come home .
" A period of fasting with no food at all for about 16 hours is enough to engage this new clock .
" So , in this case , simply avoiding any food on the plane , and then eating as soon as you land , should help you to adjust and avoid some of the uncomfortable feelings of jet lag . "
Dr Neil Stanley , a sleep expert at Norwich University Hospital , said the discovery was " potentially very beneficial " to travellers and people who work unsociable hours .
" It 's never going to make the symptoms disappear entirely , but it could certainly make them a lot more manageable , " he said .

What are these ?
A license plate that would have become the first in the nation to prominently feature a religious symbol is unlikely to be on the road any time soon after state lawmakers did not include it in a bill Tuesday .
The plate , which included an image of a Christian cross , stained - glass window and the words " I Believe , " is not in legislation passed late Tuesday that 's now headed to the governor .
Opponents of the plate said approving it would result in a court challenge because it violated the separation of church and state and gave the appearance the state was endorsing a particular religious preference .
Update
More news from Tallahassee ...
Hard - core Christians in Florida who want to show everyone looking at the rear end of their car that they believe will have to make do with a bumper sticker or a Jesus fish .
Aside from the obvious lawsuit bait , it 's not like Florida needs another special plate to go with the 110 or so that we already have that support every cause from sea turtles to junior golf .
( I 'm still holding out for the one supporting " Lesbians for the Metric System " . ) I know it 's hard to believe , but not every proposed specialty plate passes .
While the " Choose Life " plate is still out there , the legislature rejected a pro-choice plate in 2007 .
But at least they did n't pass the one celebrating Confederate heritage . : Stephen Colbert pitches for the plate : HT to SFDB and Incertus
VANCOUVER , British Columbia 
A couple of years ago , a Canadian magazine published an article arguing that the rise of Islam threatened Western values .
The article ’s tone was mocking and biting , but it said nothing that conservative magazines and blogs in the United States do not say every day without fear of legal reprisal .
Things are different here .
The magazine is on trial .
Two members of the Canadian Islamic Congress say the magazine , Maclean ’s , Canada ’s leading newsweekly , violated a provincial hate speech law by stirring up hatred against Muslims .
They say the magazine should be forbidden from saying similar things , forced to publish a rebuttal and made to compensate Muslims for injuring their “ dignity , feelings and self - respect . ”
The British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal , which held five days of hearings on those questions here last week , will soon rule on whether Maclean ’s violated the law .
As spectators lined up for the afternoon session last week , an argument broke out .
“ It ’s hate speech ! ” yelled one man .
“ It ’s free speech ! ” yelled another .
In the United States , that debate has been settled .
Under the First Amendment , newspapers and magazines can say what they like about minorities and religions  even false , provocative or hateful things  without legal consequence .
Sylvie Eymard 's Provence farmhouse kitchen should be the picture of French rural calm .
But the stockpiles of bottled water , disinfectant rinse and disposable paper plates hint at something strange .
For the past two weeks , Eymard , 41 , and her children , 13 and seven , have had a phobia of taps .
To wash up , they go out to the yard and fill a bowl from a specially delivered plastic tank of purified water on a fork - lift tractor .
They carry the water up to the bathroom to wash .
Even the dog drinks bottled water , and it is left out for the birds .
" I feel as if everything 's constantly dirty , " Eymard said , her hands deep in soapy lather scrubbing plates .
The view from the house over the fields is dominated by the nearby cooling towers of the Tricastin site , a nuclear power plant run by EDF , the company which is poised to buy British Energy and take control of most UK nuclear stations .
Next to the plant is a nuclear treatment centre run by a subsidiary of Areva , the nuclear group which hopes to design many of the new British reactors .
Last month an accident at the treatment centre during a draining operation saw liquid containing untreated uranium overflow out of a faulty tank .
About 75kg of uranium seeped into the ground and into the Gaffiere and Lauzon rivers which flow into the Rhône .
Eymard 's house is 100 metres from one of these streams .
Like a handful of rural homes near the nuclear site , hers is plumbed into the local groundwater from wells .
For 20 years she has drunk from the tap .
But after the incident there was a ban on drinking the groundwater , using it to water fields - as all local farmers do - or swimming or fishing in local lakes and streams .
Since then , Eymard feels like she is in an episode of The Simpsons , in a Springfield where people 's trust has been abused by haphazard mistakes .
" It feels like a science fiction film where experts constantly come to examine and film the people who 've been exposed . "
At the centre for adults with learning disabilities where she works , some have seen her on the TV news and innocently asked for her autograph .
At 10.30 am on the dot , two men in green overalls from the nuclear site appear at her door to collect the daily sample of water from her tap to analyse it for uranium .
Levels have fluctuated daily .
Even after the official ban was lifted this week and the families ' urine samples tested normal , Eymard wo n't drink from the tap .
" I always trusted that nuclear was totally secure .
But now I wonder , have there been other accidents in the past we have n't been told about ? "
The nuclear site at Bollène sits in a picturesque corner of Provence between the lavender fields and cypress trees that stretch north to the nougat capital of Montélimar and to the historic town of Avignon 30 miles to the south , which was hosting its famous theatre festival when the spillage occurred .
Until now most locals have accepted the plant as a risk - free part of everyday life in nuclear - dependent France .
More than 80 % of France 's electricity is generated by the country 's 58 nuclear reactors - the world 's highest ratio .
But the leak has shaken French trust in nuclear safety and embarrassed Nicolas Sarkozy as he crusades for a French - led world renaissance in atomic power .
The president wants to export French nuclear know - how around the world , including to Britain where nuclear power supplies 19 % of electricity , and London and Paris are to cooperate on a new generation of nuclear power plants .
Areva , 90 % state - owned , is at the heart of foreign cooperation agreements not just with Europe but countries such as the United Arab Emirates , Algeria and Libya .
Last year it clinched the biggest commercial nuclear power contract on record , worth € 8bn ( £ 6.3 bn ) , to supply China with two reactors and provide nuclear fuel for nearly two decades .
Areva has been criticised by France 's nuclear safety watchdog over the Tricastin leak for not adequately informing local authorities and for unsatisfactory measures and operational procedures .
The leak rated at level one of the seven - stage scale of nuclear incidents .
It was detected on the night of July 7 but the town hall and locals who continued to drink water contaminated with uranium were not informed until the following afternoon .
Areva 's chief executive , Anne Lauvergeon , called the leak an " anomaly " which posed no danger to humans or the environment .
The treatment plant has been shut and the subsidiary 's director removed .
But in recent days there have been other , lesser incidents at nuclear sites .
In Romans - sur - Isère , north of Tricastin , at another site run by an Areva subsidiary , officials discovered a burst underground pipe which had been broken for years and did not meet safety standards .
A tiny amount of lightly enriched uranium leaked but not beyond the plant .
This week , about 100 staff at Tricastin 's nuclear reactor number four were contaminated by radioactive particles that escaped from a pipe .
EDF described the contamination as " slight " .
The French government has now ordered tests on the groundwater around all nuclear sites in France .
The environment minister , Jean - Louis Borloo , said there were 86 level - one nuclear incidents in France last year and 114 in 2006 .
People living near the Tricastin plant remain concerned .
In basil and coriander fields farmed by the extended Eymard family not far from the nuclear site , part of the crop was ruined after wilting during the ban on using contaminated water .
The herbs , which are sold to make frozen seasoning , have been tested for radioactivity and cleared .
Roger Eymard , 69 , a retired farmer , now washes by pouring purified water into the shower fitting of his camper van parked in a stable .
" Nuclear was progress and we wanted that .
We thought people were competent .
Now we ask , were there previous incidents we were n't told about ? "
France 's IRSN nuclear safety institute has pinpointed high levels of uranium in the groundwater that it said could not have been caused by the recent leak alone .
A separate commission raised the possibility that this contamination could be linked to military nuclear waste at the Tricastin plant from 1964 to 1976 .
The area 's image has been so dented that the nearby Rhône Valley wine makers whose label is Coteaux du Tricastin want to change their name .
In nearby Bollène , sales of bottled water have soared despite assurances that the tap water is unaffected .
Some people have even asked chemists for iodine tablets , recommended for a nuclear emergency .
Not far from the nuclear site , Emilie Dubois , 61 , sat by her luxury swimming pool framed by fig trees , poolside bar , shower and designer outdoor kitchen .
But for two weeks the cover has been on as the family ordered tests on radioactivity levels in the pool water .
The day the emergency water ban was announced , more than 50 people swimming in a local lake were ordered out and fled .
" It was as if there was a shark attack , " one said .
Dubois was in her pool with her grandchildren when a town hall official arrived to tell her of a ban on watering with groundwater .
He said he had orders not to give an explanation .
She assumed it was a drought warning and got back in the pool .
Only from television that night did the family learn of the leak .
The pool , filled with local groundwater , was a potential contamination zone .
It has now tested safe to swim in .
Her husband is a retired engineer from the plant and her sons work in the industry .
" I 've never questioned the safety of nuclear , " she said .
She has resumed watering her vegetable patch and ate freshly picked salad for lunch .
" It 's organic but it 's been watered with the groundwater after the leak .
Why would I eat anyone else 's tomatoes that were n't organic ?
Although there are thoughts at the back of my mind as I 'm eating . "
Sarkozy recently announced that France will build a second new - generation nuclear reactor , a European pressurised water reactor or EPR .
He said nuclear power was France 's best answer to soaring energy prices and global warming .
The Green party attacked the EPR as " useless , dangerous and expensive " , saying : " France is becoming a nuclear showroom for Sarkozy the sales rep and Areva . "
Not far from the stream that was contaminated from the Tricastin leak , Joel Bernard sat in his farmhouse tallying the loss to his carrots , radishes , turnips and cherries which could n't be watered during the ban .
" Until last week , it was paradise here , " he said .
" I do n't want to return to the rural past .
But something like this creates a kind of suspicion . "

I ’m pleased to announce that our XMPP gateway for exposing a RabbitMQ instance to the global XMPP network has been released ( documentation , browse or check out code .
Update : Because it depends on a newer release of RabbitMQ than 1.3.0 , you will also need to check out the server and codegen code from our public mercurial repositories , or download them as snapshots : server , codegen .
The mod_rabbitmq module implements an ejabberd extension module which gateways AMQP ( as implemented by RabbitMQ ) to XMPP .
By bridging between the two systems , we benefit from :
* XMPP ’s internet - scale addressing and federation
* XMPP ’s presence model
* AMQP ’s store - and - forward capability
* AMQP ’s routing and filtering ( using exchanges and bindings )
The current implementation is a very simple mapping between the two systems .
Its simplicity keeps the code short , but only exposes a subset of AMQP features to the XMPP network , and vice versa .

This week ’s How - To comes from our newest contributor : Logan Williams .
This simple guide will show you how to build a digital synthesizer that generates and manipulates square waves .
Your synthesizer will have one oscillator , which produces a variable pitch controlled by a potentiometer , as well as an LFO which modulates that pitch at a variable frequency .
The part count for this project is quite low , and it can be built for under $ 20 .
Finding the Parts
The first step in building this digital synthesizer is to procure the parts that you will need .
Most of these can be bought at RadioShack , but RadioShack ’s prices are often much more expensive than ordering online .
All of the parts for this project can be purchased at Jameco , Digi - Key , or Mouser .
We ’ve provided Jameco part numbers below .
If you do n’t mind waiting , this is the best way to order parts .

Note :
The potentiometers and audio jack must be either taped or soldered to 22 AWG solid core wire .
Soldering is highly recommended , as it produces a more secure connection .
Creating an oscillator
Before we can begin with the digital synthesizer , we must generate the correct voltage .
Most of you will be familiar with using a 7805 5V voltage regulator .
It is very simple ; connect the +9V from the battery to the left hand pin , ground the middle pin , and the right hand is +5V .
The most basic circuit in any synthesizer is the oscillator .
A square wave oscillator constantly alternates between two voltages , in this case +5V and 0V .
We have a logic inverter to create this , which operates quite simply ; if it is given +5 V in ( a logic 1 ) , it give
s 0V out
( a logic 0 ) and if it is given a logic 0 , it gives a logic 1 as output .
When the input and output are connected together , it will oscillate rapidly between those two values : a 0 goes in , comes out as a 1 , goes in , comes out as a 0 , and so on .
The problem is that it oscillates much too fast .
A resistor capacitor ( RC ) delay circuit can be added to slow it down .
This forces the output current to charge the capacitor before it can pass through to the input .
The resulting brief delay slows the oscillations to audible frequencies .
To build the oscillator , assemble the schematic below on a breadboard .
When done , the oscillator should look something like this :
Connect one side of the audio jack to 0V and the other side to the output , and it will sound like this :
Controlling the oscillator
We can make things more interesting by allowing the user to change the frequency .
We replace the constant resistor R1 with a potentiometer , such as the 100K R2 .
This is a simple change to do , and is reflected in this altered schematic .
Now the oscillator sounds like this :
Much more interesting .
Try playing an actual song , if you dare .
Duty cycle adjustment
We can add some basic timbre control to make the oscillator more interesting .
The duty cycle of a square wave is how long it spends at logic 1 vs. at logic 0 .
For example , a wave that spends 1 ms at +5V and 1ms at 0V per cycle would have a 50 % duty cycle .
1.5 ms at +5V and 0.5 ms at 0V would be a 75 % duty cycle .
To adjust the wave ’s duty cycle , we can add another potentiometer and diode to the circuit .
When the input is high and the output is low , current will be able to flow through both potentiometers , decreasing the amount of time it takes to charge the capacitor , and increasing the duty cycle .
It should sound like this when completed :
Creating an LFO
A low - frequency oscillator ( LFO ) is an oscillator that oscillates very slowly , from 1 to 100 cycles per second .
We will use an LFO to alternate the pitch of our oscillator between two different frequencies .
This can be used for siren like sound effects , timbre control , or musical sequences .
The circuit to control the LFO is slightly more complex than the ones we have used before .
Because it uses a capacitor with 10 x the capacitance , and a potentiometer with 10 x the resistance , the oscillations are 100x slower than our first oscillator .
The LFO connects to the gate of the IRF 510 MOSFET transistor .
When the output of the LFO is +5V , the transistor connects its source and drain pins .
With these pins connected , current can flow through the second potentiometer , increasing the pitch .
When the LFO returns to 0V , the potentiometer is disconnected , and the pitch drops back to its original level .
There are quite a number of sounds that can be produced with the LFO , such as this :
and this :
Conclusion
You have now made your own simple digital synthesizer .
Keep experimenting with different control methods .
The frequency is adjusted with just resistance , so almost anything can be used for an input .
Try a photocell , or a flex sensor .
Try combining the LFO and the duty cycle adjustment .
Try using it to actually make music !
We ’d love to see what you come up with .

That ’s all we know .
U.S. stocks will continue to fall next week , in continuation of a sell - off that saw the Dow Jones Industrial Average experience its worst week in over four years , due to nervousness that the easy - money binge of the last few years has come to an end .
No fireworks in earnings so far .
It will be tough for Wall Street to shake off the bear market blues next week if the price of oil keeps rising and the earnings season kick - off from Alcoa and General Electric disappoints investors .
Stocks will remain vulnerable to any new signs of distress from hedge funds hit by their exposure to bad U.S. home loans , as well as from credit markets , where Wall Street firms and corporations are finding it harder and harder to obtain financing .
Oil has become the biggest wild card for growth and corporate profits .
It jumped to a record above $ 145 a barrel on Thursday , driven by tensions between Israel and Iran , before the long holiday weekend to mark US Independence Day .
The price of crude is up 50 percent so far this year .
On Friday , US markets are closed on July 4th for the Independence Day holiday .
Financial results from Alcoa and GE will kick off the second - quarter earnings season next week .
Aluminum company Alcoa , the first Dow component to report results , will release its quarterly numbers on Tuesday .
GE , another Dow industrial and a bellwether for the US economy , will report earnings on Friday .
Aside from second - quarter results , investors are anxious to see the companies ’ forecasts for world economic growth and their own corporate sales prospects .

More clarity on the economic outlook may come from Federal Reserve chairman Ben Bernanke .
He is expected to speak twice , first at an FDIC mortgage lending forum on Tuesday and on Thursday , he will testify before on financial market regulation before the House Financial Services Committee .
But it ’s oil that will remain a top concern .
“ The price of crude oil is on the top of everyone ’s list , ” said Dan Peirce , a portfolio manager of the global asset allocation group at State Street Global Advisors in Boston .
“ We saw a pullback one month ago , only to see it come back with a vengeance , which really pressured major equity markets . ”
Expectation was high that a combination of a weak US dollar , lower US crude stockpiles and tension between Israel and major oil producer Iran would push prices to $ 150 a barrel before the close of trade , in line with a prediction made last month .
For the holiday - shortened week , the Dow Jones industrial average ended down 0.5 per cent , the Standard & Poor ’s 500 Index slid 1.2 pc and the Nasdaq Composite Index dropped 3 pc .
This was the fifth straight weekly decline for the S&P 500 and the Nasdaq , and the Dow ’s third straight week of losses .
On Wednesday the Dow closed more than 20 pc below its all - time closing high reached in October , crossing the threshold typically considered as the onset of a bear market .
The Dow closed above that mark on Thursday .
But the broader S&P 500 index on Thursday slipped into bear territory during the trading session , unable to withstand the avalanche of gloomy global economic news and profit outlooks , surging inflation fears and weakening consumer confidence .
While the S&P 500 eked out a slight advance by Thursday ’s close to climb out the bear market , optimism appeared scarce that there would be enough bargain hunting next week to help stocks decisively snap out of their slump .
“ We ’ve become nervous bulls , ” said Brian Gendreau , a New York - based investment strategist at ING Investment Management Americas , which recently went “ neutral ” on US stocks .
“ Equities have become a play on oil and we just do not know what oil will do .
So we are on the sidelines for now , ” he added .
General Electric , the second - largest US company by market capitalization , will garner a great deal of attention when it releases quarterly earnings at the end of the week .
The company is viewed as an economic bellwether because of the range of its businesses .
Since financial services account for a large chunk of its revenues , GE ’s results are also scrutinised for clues on the health of the financial sector , the biggest drag on the stock market this year .
Reuters Estimates sees GE reporting profit of $ 5.33 billion in the second quarter , or 54 cents per share , compared with year - earlier earnings of $ 5.4bn .
Results deviating from forecasts are expected to wield a disproportionate impact on the market , for better – if earnings are higher than expected – or worse , if the company misses earnings , such as occurred in the first quarter .
Fresh in the market ’s memory is GE posting an unexpected drop of 6 percent in first - quarter profit , with an EPS of 44 cents a share , 7 cents below analysts ’ forecasts .
The news drove GE ’s stock down nearly 13 pc , their sharpest drop in two decades , wiping out about $ 45bn of market value and dragging global markets down into the mud .
The earnings figures aside , the stock market will be looking for market direction by poring over what GE has to say about the next quarter or two , said Andre Bakhos , president of Princeton Financial Group in Princeton , New Jersey .
“ They ( investors ) do n’t want to hear about a slowdown in any major economies , ” he said .
“ They do n’t want to hear about paring back revenue estimates .
That would exacerbate already heightened fears of recession woven into the market . ”
Alcoa ’s earnings on Tuesday will be put under the microscope for comments about industrial demand in economies abroad , particularly Asia and South America , he said .

The Artist 's Right to Share in the Resale of Art
Y ou live in California and purchased a painting by a local artist in 1989 in California .
Now you have negotiated to sell the painting to a buyer who is paying $ 2,500.00 for it -- $ 500.00 more than you paid .
After receiving the selling price , you may invest all of the $ 2,500.00 in the stock market ?
True or false ?
False .
California has a statute which regulates the resale of fine art .
This statute requires the seller to retain 5 % of the resale price and to remit it to the artist within 90 days of the sale .
If the seller cannot locate the artist , the seller is required to transfer 5 % of the resale price to the California Art Council within the same time frame .
If the seller fails to make the transfer , the artist may bring an action for damages within three years after the date of sale or one year after the discovery of the sale , whichever is longer .
The prevailing party is entitled to attorney fees .
The artists from whom you purchased the painting died in 1991 .
Now you may invest the entire proceeds of sale in the stock market ?
True or false ?
False .
The right of the artist to receive 5 % of the resale price of his / her work inures to his or her heirs or person inheriting under their Will or Trust until the 20th anniversary of the artist 's death .
The resale price of the painting was only $ 1,850.00 -- $ 150.00 less than you paid for the painting originally .
Now you may invest the entire proceeds in the stock market ?
True or false ?
True .
If the resale price is less than $ 1,000.00 or less than the price paid by the seller , there is no duty on the seller to pay the artist any portion of the resale price .
You anticipated the California resale law and when you purchased the painting in 1989 , you had the artist sign a waiver of his / her rights to receive 5 % of any resale .
With this waiver in your file , you may now invest the entire sale price of $ 2,500.00 in the stock market ?
True or false ?
False .
The right of the artist to receive 5 % of any resale may not be waived .
The right to receive 5 % may be only waived if there is a written contract providing the artist with MORE THAN 5 % of any resale .
Hints : Keep a record of : the artist 's address when purchasing a work of fine art .
Only buy fine art that you plan to keep forever in your private collection .
Include the 5 % resale remit to the artist in your selling price .

Normally I do n’t care much about cable chat show ratings , but for this one I ’ll bite .
From a press release just out from NBC …
In a large randomized trial of human lactation , researchers have found evidence that prolonged breast - feeding is associated with improved scores on some intelligence tests in childhood .
The results , published in the May issue of The Archives of General Psychiatry , appear to confirm those of previous observational studies .
Researchers in Belarus trained 8,457 mother - infant pairs with an extensive breast - feeding educational program , while a control group of 7,856 received standard care .
At three months , 73 percent of the trained mothers , but only 60 percent of the controls , were still exclusively breast - feeding .
By six months , exclusive breast - feeding had declined substantially in both groups , to 7.9 percent for the education group and 0.6 percent for the controls .
At 6 ½ years , the breast - fed group scored significantly higher on tests of vocabulary , word matching and verbal I.Q. , although the differences in several other tests of intelligence were not significant .
Teacher ratings of the children were consistently higher for those who were breast - fed .

Me : “ Stuff missing ?
Like what ? ”
Caller : “ Well , for starters , there ’s no book with it … and I do n’t know how to assemble it . ”
Me : “ Book ?
What book ?
We do n’t have books .
We just sell tattoo inks , needles , machines … and assembly ?
Is there something not assembled in your kit ? ”
Caller : “ Yeah , it ’s all in pieces … it ’s a piece of crap ! ”
Me : “ Pieces ?
Did it get damaged during shipment to you ? ”
Caller : “ No , it ’s just a bunch of pieces .
There ’s a power supply , foot pedal , a couple of tattoo machines … but I gotta put it together myself .
That ’s bulls ***!
I do n’t know what I ’m doing !
You guys should have assembled everything for me before shipping . ”
Me : “ You want us to assemble your tattoo shop for you ?
Wait a sec …
Did you say you do n’t know what you ’re doing ? ”
Caller : “ That ’s right .
I ’ve never tattooed before .
That ’s why I thought there ’d be a book with the kit . ”
Me : “ You mean like : step one , put a picture on the skin ; step two , dip the needle in ink ; step three , tattoo the ink into the skin ? ”
Caller : “ Yeah , that ’s it !
Why did n’t you guys give me that kinda book when I bought the kit ! ? ”
Me : “ So , how are you expecting to learn to tattoo ?
Are you not doing a tattoo apprenticeship at a real tattoo shop , where they teach you to do this sort of thing ? ”
Caller : “ Nah … I just figured I ’d start off tattooing my wife until I can figure it out … ”

現在のところの予定では 、GimpとGEGLの統合は段階的に行われるとのことです。
GEGLへの移行はGIMPの内部構造を大きく変えるものです。たとえば画像深度ひとつをとっても今までの8bit/pixelから16bit floatに変わるのですから、コードの大幅な見直しが必要になります。そのため開発者は時間をかけてGEGLに移行していくプランを立てています。以下の内容は、もう半年以上も前になるGIMP-2.4がリリースされた前後の、今後のGimp開発予定の時点でのGEGLマイグレーション計画です。実際の開発はその時点での状況によって変化していくので、これとは違ってくることに注意してください。Gimp-2.5.2まで開発が進んでいる現時点では、GimpImageMapToolを利用する色補正機能がGEGLのオペレーションに置き換わっています。具体的にGEGLオペレーションに置き換わった機能は、カラーバランス、色相/彩度、着色、明るさ/コントラスト、閾値、レベルツール、カーブツール、ポスタリゼーション、色→反転、色→脱色、です。( app/gegl/)
これらの機能を、同一画像でGEGLをオンにした場合とオフにした場合とで比較すると少々結果が異なるのに気付きます。すでにGEGLに置き換えられた機能については、まだ以前の実装コードが残っていてGEGLをオフにすれば古いほうを使うようになっています。両方が存在しているということですね。「上の機能を利用している色修正ツール(焼き込み/覆い焼きetc)
をGEGLで実装」というのはまだ行われていないようです。上のGimpImageMapToolへのGEGL置き換えが1月中に終わってしまったのに手が加えられていないことから考えると、おそらくGimp-2.6での実現は見送られるのでしょう。個人的に気になっているのは、16bitカラーやCMYK完全対応はどの時点から使えるようになるのかということです。上の予定からすると、楽観的に見ればGimp-2.8から制限つきで使えるようになりそうです。しかし実際にはその時になってみないと分かりません。現在の開発ペースや追加/変更されている機能や開発者の手数からすると、まだまだ開発が遅れそうな気配がします。そのため、まだ完全にGEGLに対応していないGIMP-2.10が出てもおかしくないかも。*****GIMP-developer ML " is watercolor ( brush color blending mode ) ... "
よりいわゆる回転キャンバス機能。超期待。*****GEGL自身への評価はさておき、今後GimpがGEGLべったりになっていくことは間違いないでしょう。その過渡期にある現在、さまざまな可能性の模索やアイデアの提案はGEGLの将来を豊かにするはずです。

As companies transition from short - term pandemic response to long - term planning , many are contemplating how differently the industry might look in the months and years to come
Having written a list on the ten most evil children in the world , I am very pleased to have received this submission of 7 children who are far from evil ; they are children who have changed the world by their actions or examples .
7 Anne Frank 1929 – 1945
Annelies Marie “ Anne ” Frank was a German - born Jewish girl from the city of Frankfurt .
She gained international fame posthumously following the publication of her diary which documents her experiences hiding during the German occupation of the Netherlands in World War II .
Anne and her family moved to Amsterdam in 1933 after the Nazis gained power in Germany , and were trapped by the occupation of the Netherlands , which began in 1940 .
As persecutions against the Jewish population increased , the family went into hiding in July 1942 in hidden rooms in her father Otto Frank ’s office building .
After two years , the group was betrayed and transported to concentration camps .
Seven months after her arrest , Anne Frank died of typhus in the Bergen - Belsen concentration camp , within days of the death of her sister , Margot Frank .
Her father Otto , the only survivor of the group , returned to Amsterdam after the war to find that her diary had been saved , and his efforts led to its publication in 1947 .
It was translated from its original Dutch and first published in English in 1952 as The Diary of a Young Girl .
Anne Frank has been acknowledged for the quality of her writing , and has become one of the most renowned and discussed of Holocaust victims .
6 Samantha Smith 1972 – 1985
Image : 1985 USSR Stamp with “ Samantha Smith ” in Cyrillic .
Samantha Reed Smith was an American schoolgirl from Manchester , Maine who became famous in the Cold War-era United States and Soviet Union .
In November 1982 , when Smith was 10 years old , she wrote to Soviet leader Yuri Andropov , seeking to understand why the relations between the Soviet Union and the United States were so tense .
Her letter was published in the Soviet newspaper Pravda .
Samantha was happy to discover that her letter had been published , however , she had not received a reply .
She then sent a letter to the Soviet Union ’s Ambassador to the United States asking if Mr. Andropov intended to respond .
On April 26 , 1983 , she received a response from Andropov .
Smith attracted extensive media attention in both countries as a “ Goodwill Ambassador ” , and became known as “ America ’s Youngest Ambassador ” participating in peacemaking activities in Japan .
She wrote a book and co-starred in a television series , before her death at the age of 13 in the Bar Harbor Airlines Flight 1808 plane crash .
5 Hector Pieterson 1964 – 1976
Image : Sam Nzima ’s famous June 16 , 1976 photograph of Mbuyisa Makhubo carrying Hector Pieterson , accompanied by Hector ’s sister , Antoinette .
Hector Pieterson ( 1964 – 16 June 1976 ) became the iconic image of the 1976 Soweto uprising in apartheid South Africa when a news photograph by Sam Nzima of the dying Hector being carried by a fellow student , was published around the world .
He was killed at the age of 12 when the police opened fire on protesting students .
For years , June 16 stood as a symbol of resistance to the brutality of the apartheid government .
Today , it is known as National Youth Day — a day on which South Africans honour young people and bring attention to their needs .
Since June 1976 , Hector ’s surname has been spelled Peterson and Pietersen by the press but the family insists that the correct spelling is Pieterson .
The Pieterson family was originally the Pitso family but decided to adopt the Pieterson name to try to pass as “ Coloured ” ( the apartheid - era name for people of mixed race ) , because Coloured people enjoyed somewhat better privileges under apartheid than blacks did .
On June 16 , 2002 the Hector Pieterson Memorial and Museum was opened near the place he was shot in Orlando West , Soweto to honour Hector and those who died around the country in the 1976 uprising .
4 Iqbal Masih 1982 – 1995
Iqbal Masih was a Pakistani boy who was sold to a carpet industry as a child slave at the age of 4 for the equivalent of ( 12 ) USD .
Iqbal was held by a string to a carpet loom in a small town called Muridke near Lahore .
He was made to work twelve hours per day .
Due to long hours of hard work and insufficient food and care , Iqbal was undersized .
At twelve years of age , Iqbal was the size of a six - year old boy .
At the age of 10 , he escaped the brutal slavery and later joined a Bonded Labor Liberation Front of Pakistan to help stop child labour around the world , and Iqbal helped over 3,000 Pakistani children that were in bonded labour , escape to freedom .
Iqbal gave talks about child labour all around the world .
He was murdered on Easter Sunday 1995 .
It is assumed by many that he was assassinated by members of the “ Carpet Mafia ” because of the publicity he brought towards the child labour industry .
Some locals were accused of the crime , however .
In 1994 , Iqbal was awarded the Reebok Human Rights Award .
In 2000 , when The World ’s Children ’s Prize for the Rights of the Child was formed , he was posthumously awarded this prize as one of the first laureates .
3 Nkosi Johnson 1989 – 2001
Nkosi , born Xolani Nkosi , was born to Nonthlanthla Daphne Nkosi in a township east of Johannesburg in 1989 .
He never knew his father .
Nkosi was HIV - positive from birth , and was legally adopted by Gail Johnson , a Johannesburg Public Relations practitioner , when his own mother , debilitated by the disease , was no longer able to care for him .
The young Nkosi Johnson first came to public attention in 1997 , when a primary school in the Johannesburg suburb of Melville refused to accept him as a pupil because of his HIV - positive status .
The incident caused a furor at the highest political level — South Africa ’s Constitution forbids discrimination on the grounds of medical status — and the school later reversed its decision .
Nkosi was the keynote speaker at the 13th International AIDS Conference , where he encouraged AIDS victims to be open about the disease and to seek equal treatment .
Nkosi finished his speech with the words .
“ Care for us and accept us – we are all human beings .
We are normal .
We have hands .
We have feet .
We can walk , we can talk , we have needs just like everyone else – do n’t be afraid of us – we are all the same ! ”
Nelson Mandela referred to Nkosi as an “ icon of the struggle for life . ”
He was ranked fifth amongst SABC3 ’s Great South Africans .
At the time of his death , he was the longest - surviving HIV - positive born child .
Together with his foster mother , Nkosi founded a refuge for HIV positive mothers and their children , Nkosi ’s Haven , in Johannesburg . [ 6 ]
In November 2005 , Gail represented Nkosi when he posthumously received the International Children ’s Peace Prize from the hands of Mikhail Gorbachev .
Nkosi ’s Haven received the US $ 100,000 prize money from the KidsRights Foundation as well as a statuette which has been named the Nkosi in Nkosi Johnson ’s honour .
Nkosi ’s life is the subject of the book We Are All the Same by Jim Wooten .
2 Om Prakash Gurjar 1992
At the age of five , he was taken away from his parents and for three years he worked in the fields .
After he was rescued by activists of Bachpan Bachao Andolan , Om campaigned for free education in his native Rajasthan .
He then helped to set up a network of what are known as “ child friendly villages ” , places where children ’s rights are respected and child labour is not allowed .
He also set up a network that aims to give all children a birth certificate as a way of helping to protect them from exploitation .
He also worked to ensure children are given birth certificates .
He says such registration is the first step towards enshrining children ’s rights , proving their age , and helping to protect them from slavery , trafficking , forced marriage or serving as a child soldiers .
He was awarded the International Children ’s Peace Prize by former South African President FW de Klerk , who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1993 .
1 Thandiwe Chama 1991
A 16 - year - old Zambian girl , Thandiwe Chama of Lusaka ’s Chawama township has scooped the 2007 International Children ’s Peace Prize beating 28 other nominees from across the world .
The prestigious prize was presented to Thandiwe in The Hague on Sunday by Nobel Peace Laureate , Betty Williams and Live8 initiator , Sir Bob Geldof .
The Prize consists of a statuette – “ the Nkosi ” – and 100,000 euros , which are to be awarded to a direct aid project in the spirit of the young winner ’s efforts .
In 1999 , when she was only eight - years - old , her school was closed because there were no teachers .
Thandiwe refused to accept this and led 60 other children in walking to find another school .
As a result , all the children were taken into the Jack Cecup School .
Strengthened by this achievement , Thandiwe has been fighting ever since for the right to education for all children .
Thandiwe continues to impress , for example by speaking in church about children and AIDS – an issue not always discussed easily in churches .
With a friend , she wrote and illustrated a booklet called “ The Chicken with AIDS ” , telling young children about the perils of AIDS .
“ It ’s so important to know that also a child has rights .
At school I learned about rights .
And I knew then that this was something I wanted to fight for .
Because if children are given an opportunity , they for sure can contribute in making this world a better place . ” – Thandiwe Chama

Even faster UTF - 8 character counting
I recently came across two articles , " Counting characters in UTF - 8 strings is fast " by Kragen Sitaker , and " Counting characters in UTF - 8 strings is fast ( er ) " by George Pollard , which provide a series of successively faster ways of ( as the article names suggest ) counting the number of UTF - 8 characters in a NUL - terminated string .
We can do better .
Kragen takes the approach of examining each byte in sequence and asking if ( a ) is it the terminating NUL , and ( b ) is it the first of a UTF - 8 character .
This last test is quite easy : Bytes 0x01 through 0x7 F in UTF - 8 represent the corresponding ASCII characters , while bytes 0xC0 through 0xFF are the first byte of a multi - byte character .
This results in the following inner loop ( modulo some style changes to make it easier to compare this against later versions ) :
while ( s [i ] ) { if ( ( s [ i ] & 0xC0 ) != 0x80 ) j++ ; i++ ; } return ( j ) ;
Kragen continues by comparing this to an optimized version written in x86 assembly language by Aristotle Pagaltzis ; Aristotle 's version cleverly takes advantage of the shl instruction setting the sign , carry , and zero flags , but otherwise applies exactly the same algorithm :
loopa : dec %ecx loopb : lodsb shl $ 1 , %al js loopa jc loopb jnz loopa
However , this assembly language version , like Kragen 's C version , inspects each of the bytes one by one , which inherently limits the performance .
George Pollard makes the assumption that the input string is valid UTF - 8 , and notices that by looking at the first byte of a multibyte character , we can determine the length of the character :
If the first byte is between 0xC0 and 0xDF , the UTF - 8 character has two bytes ; if it is between 0xE0 and 0xEF , the UTF - 8 character has 3 bytes ; and if it is 0xF0 and 0xFF , the UTF - 8 character has 4 bytes .
After reading the first byte of a multibyte character , George skips over the trailing bytes .
He also fast - paths the handling of ASCII characters , treating characters as signed bytes in order to distinguish between ASCII and non-ASCII characters , while giving a wonderful example of using a goto to jump from the middle of one loop into the middle of another :
while ( s [ i ] >
0 ) { ascii : i++ ; } count += i - iBefore ; while ( s[i ] ) { if ( s [ i ] >
0 ) { iBefore = i ; goto ascii ; } else { switch ( 0xF0 & s[ i ] ) { case 0xE0 : i += 3 ; break ; case 0xF0 : i += 4 ; break ; default : i += 2 ; break ; } } count ++ ; }
While this code is considerably faster than both Kragen 's C code and Aristotle 's assembly code , it suffers from two performance limiting factors :
First , it uses conditional branches which will only be consistently predicted correctly if all of the characters encountered have the same length ; and second , it still inspects characters one by one .
This can be improved in three ways :
Instead of using conditional branches , identify the initial bytes of UTF - 8 characters using logical operations only .
Instead of handling one character at once , vectorize : Handle lots of bytes in parallel .
In order to reduce the cost of waiting for memory , prefetch data if possible .
# define ONEMASK ( ( size_t ) ( - 1 ) / 0xFF ) static size_t cp_strlen_utf8 ( const char * _s ) { const char * s ; size_t count = 0 ; size_t u ; unsigned char b ; /*
Handle any initial misaligned bytes .
*/ for ( s = _s ; ( uintptr_t ) (s ) & ( sizeof ( size_t ) - 1 ) ; s++) { b = *s ; /*
Exit if we hit a zero byte .
*/ if ( b == ' \0 ' ) goto done ; /*
Is this byte NOT the first byte of a character ? */ count += ( b >> 7 ) & ( ( ~b ) >>
6 ) ; } /* Handle complete blocks .
*/ for ( ; ; s += sizeof ( size_t ) ) { /* Prefetch 256 bytes ahead .
*/ __builtin_prefetch(&s [ 256 ] , 0 , 0 ) ; /* Grab 4 or 8 bytes of UTF - 8 data . */ u = *( size_t *) (s ) ; /*
Exit the loop if there are any zero bytes .
*/ if ( ( u - ONEMASK ) & ( ~u ) & ( ONEMASK * 0x80 ) ) break ; /*
Count bytes which are NOT the first byte of a character .
*/ u = ( ( u & ( ONEMASK * 0x80 ) ) >>
7 ) & ( ( ~u ) >> 6 ) ; count += ( u * ONEMASK ) >> ( ( sizeof ( size_t ) - 1 ) * 8 ) ; } /*
Take care of any left - over bytes .
*/ for ( ; ; s++) { b = *s ; /*
Exit if we hit a zero byte .
*/ if ( b == ' \0 ' ) break ; /*
Is this byte NOT the first byte of a character ? */ count += ( b >> 7 ) & ( ( ~b ) >> 6 ) ; } done : return ( (s - _s ) - count ) ; }
Making these improvements gave me the following code :
How much faster is this ?
I put together a a slightly improved version of Kragen 's benchmark code , using a buffer filled with valid UTF - 8 text instead of his more artificial test cases , and ran it on an Opteron 848 @ 2.2 GHz running FreeBSD 7.0 - RELEASE - p1 after compiling with gcc 4.2.1 with the - O3 flag set .
Some notes to help decipher the output :
The function names and their meanings are gcc_strlen = the strlen ( ) function as compiled by gcc ; kjs_strlen = Kragen 's non-UTF - 8 strlen function ; cp_strlen = my non-UTF - 8 strlen function ( not shown here , but see the source code if you 're interested ) ; kjs_strlen_utf8 = Kragen 's UTF - 8 character counter ; gp_strlen_utf8 = George 's UTF - 8 character counter ; and cp_strlen_utf8 = my UTF - 8 character counter .
The test strings are " hello , world " , " naïve " , and " こんにちは " .
The values printed on each line before the colon are the result computed -- the number of bytes for strlen functions , and the number of UTF - 8 characters for strlen_utf8 functions ; the values after the colon are the mean and standard deviation time taken in seconds .
The improvement is striking :
testing 33554424 bytes of repeated " hello , world " : gcc_strlen = 33554424 : 0.034169 +/- 0.000090 kjs_strlen = 33554424 : 0.049529 +/- 0.000280 cp_strlen = 33554424 : 0.011357 +/- 0.000030 kjs_strlen_utf8 = 33554424 : 0.060930 +/- 0.000031 gp_strlen_utf8 = 33554424 : 0.049675 +/- 0.000294 cp_strlen_utf8 = 33554424 : 0.014049 +/- 0.000047 testing 33554430 bytes of repeated " na?ve " : gcc_strlen = 33554430 : 0.034168 +/- 0.000069 kjs_strlen = 33554430 : 0.049544 +/- 0.000287 cp_strlen = 33554430 : 0.011348 +/- 0.000021 kjs_strlen_utf8 = 27962025 : 0.061020 +/- 0.000291 gp_strlen_utf8 = 27962025 : 0.059726 +/- 0.000029 cp_strlen_utf8 = 27962025 : 0.014041 +/- 0.000043 testing 33554430 bytes of repeated " ????? " : gcc_strlen = 33554430 : 0.034157 +/- 0.000088 kjs_strlen = 33554430 : 0.049437 +/- 0.000018 cp_strlen = 33554430 : 0.011438 +/- 0.000286 kjs_strlen_utf8 = 11184810 : 0.060919 +/- 0.000032 gp_strlen_utf8 = 11184810 : 0.027454 +/- 0.000031 cp_strlen_utf8 = 11184810 : 0.014133 +/- 0.000287
Not only is vectorized character counting faster than the " look at a byte , skip a few " approach , it is n't even close :
Even when the characters are 3 bytes each ( as in the case of " こんにちは " ) , the vectorized approach wins by a factor of 2 ; and its lead is larger when the skipping approach can't skip as many bytes .
Moreover , vectorized character counting is only 30 % slower than a vectorized strlen and more than twice as fast as a non-vectorized strlen -- although given that character counting runs at slightly faster than one byte per clock cycle , it 's not surprising that non-vectorized code can't keep up !
Can we do better ?
I think so .
My code uses 64 - bit integer registers to manipulate 8 bytes at once ; this is the same size as MMX registers , so those probably wo n't be very useful , but with SSE2 16 can be manipulated at once , which could provide another doubling of the performance .
Beyond a doubling ?
Well , the first rule of optimization is to start by finding a good algorithm -- and any algorithm in which the critical path involves counting UTF - 8 characters in a 32 megabyte NUL - terminated string is doing something wrong .
This is very much a toy problem ; but the lesson it teaches is worth remembering : Vectorization is good !

io9 wants to encourage mad scientists in every field , but especially in the area of synthetic biology .
That 's because synthetic biologists are the people who are going to build new life forms , like ligers and unicorns and people with claws and glowing eyes .
OK , they might build bacteria that can clean up oil spills and repair damaged kidneys too .
The point is , building new lifeforms is the science of the future and therefore you can never have too many garage laboratories and mad scientists devoted to it .
That 's why io9 is sponsoring a contest to find two of the best synthetic life forms you can design for us .
The winners in our two categories will get either an all - expenses - paid trip to the kickass Synthetic Biology Conference in Hong Kong this October , or $ 1000 and a chance to have their creature drawn by a cool comic book artist .
Find out more below .

There are two categories in the contest , each with their own prize .
The important thing to remember is that this contest is about creating cool new lifeforms that are also , in some way , entertaining .
So each entry will be judged for plausibility ( i.e. whether it is scientifically justifiable ) , creativity , usefulness , and entertainment value .
Our esteemed judges include synthetic biologist Drew Endy ( MIT ) , evolutionary biologist and PLoS co-founder Michael Eisen ( UC Berkeley ) , Spore game developer Jason Shankel ( EA / Maxis ) , and biology researcher / io9 " ask a biogeek " columnist Terry Johnson ( UC Berkeley ) .

Category One : BioBricks Lifeform
Using the BioBricks registry of standard biological parts , propose a lifeform design that you could conceivably create in a lab .
Must include a complete description of how you would make the lifeform , what it would do , and what possible hazards might be involved in creating it .
You may design this creature with a team , but only one of you can claim the prize .
You may enter lifeforms that you have entered in other contests , but you must state in your entry which contest ( s ) you 've already entered .
Your entry should be in the form of a short scientific paper ( no more than 3000 words ) , with illustrations .
More points given if you 've actually got a working organism .
Prize :
All travel and hotel expenses paid trip to the Synthetic Biology Conference in Hong Kong in October , as well as the chance to present your research there .
Category Two : General Synthetic Lifeform
This lifeform can be more creative .
Propose a scientifically justifiable lifeform , which could conceivably be created using current technology .
Explain how you would create it , what it would do , and hazards involved .
Unlike the BioBricks lifeform , this lifeform can be more speculative .
It should be science fictional , but must remain scientifically plausible .
Your entry should be less than 3,000 words , please .
Illustrations and diagrams are a good idea .
Prize : $ 1000 , plus a cool comic book artist will draw your lifeform and you 'll get a signed copy of the original art .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
DEADLINE FOR ALL ENTRIES IS AUGUST 25 AT MIDNIGHT PST .
General Rules
1. Send queries and completed entries to madscience@io9.com .
2 . On entries , please include your full name , an email and phone number where we can reach you , plus any information about other contests you may have entered your lifeform in .
3. Winners will be announced September 8 .
4 . All general Gawker contest rules apply .
Wow that was dumb .
McCain put out a press release today criticizing Obama for not politicizing our wounded troops .
Seriously .
McCain is upset that Obama did NOT want to appear to be using our wounded troops for a photo op , so after the Pentagon raised the concern that Obama ’s planned visit to wounded vets in Europe might appear as just that , Obama canceled the trip .
McCain , who never misses a chance to imply that Obama is un-American and hates the troops , now went a step further .
He had his campaign call Obama “ a young man ” in a press release , clearly implying that Obama is too young to be president .
Which is ironic , considering that McCain is n’t just 72 years old this summer – he ’s an old 72 .
McCain is not your father .
He ’s your grandfather .
And while we all love and loved our grandfathers , we do n’t necessarily think they ’re up to being the leader of the free world because , quite simply , 72 year olds do n’t have the energy and stamina , and often the mental acuity , of 46 year olds .
So it ’s rather odd , and I would argue dangerous , for McCain to now say that age is a legitimate issue in this race when he ’s beyond the age of most presidential candidates and Obama is smack in the middle .
Not to mention , with the growing number of times of late that McCain has confused key facts regarding his signature issue , national security , you ’d think McCain would be the last person to argue that age is a relevant factor in this race .
But today he just did .

Hobbled by the credit crisis at home , Citigroup has limped through nine months in the red , reporting a $ 2.5 billion quarterly loss on Friday .
But across the financial company ’s global empire , which spans more than 100 countries , similar tremors may be starting .
In countries like Mexico , Brazil and India , loans in areas like home mortgages and credit cards are beginning to sour , as they have in the United States .
So far the problems are small .
And Citigroup executives , who have spent months trying to turn the company around , say it is too soon to tell how much the problems might spread .
The troubles hint at what could be in store for other American companies that rely on earnings from overseas , particularly when times are lean at home .
“ We have clearly had some deterioration in credit internationally , ” said Gary L. Crittenden , the chief financial officer of Citigroup .
“ That ’s not isolated to Citigroup , that ’s a broader question . ”
Book Reviews
Smart and Gets Things Done by Joel Spolsky
ISBN - 13 : 978-1590598382
Publisher : Apress
Pages : 182
The title " Smart and Gets Things Done " refers to the criterions you look for in a technical interview .
These are the candidates you want to hire .
But there 's more to hiring technical talent than an interview , hence the rest of the book .
First of all , Joel motivates why you should care about finding the best developers .
To any programmers who care about their craft this is obvious ; there 's a tremendous variation not only in productivity but also in quality between programmers .
And it 's simply not a matter of throwing more man-hours on the problem , let 's say by hiring 10 mediocre programmers instead of a really great one .
Brooks law provides an economic argument against that idea .
Besides that , a great programmer writes code that lesser skilled programmers will never , ever be able to deliver .
On some level , most managers understand this .
The problem is that almost everyone does little more than paying lip service to the idea .
Joel not only understands it , he also bases his company on the idea and provides some rather convincing data and discussions .
It 's an interesting and important introductory chapter that sets the stage for the rest of the book .
Now that we know who we want , where do we find those great hackers ?
This may well be the trickiest part of the problem ; as Joel points out , great programmers are never on the market .
Joel suggests internship as a way of capturing the truly great programmers when they 're still in collage , before they even realize that there is a job - market .
I like the idea and it seems to work well for Fog Creek ( there 's even a DVD documenting part of the experience and I do recommend it ) .
Joel also presents the alternative of building your own community .
This alternative is marked with a very appropriate asterisk meaning " hard " .
However , if you get there , your recruiting problems are probably solved .
After getting potential candidates to apply for an open position , it 's time to sort out the truly great ones .
Joel shares his ideas for sorting resumes and recommends a phone interview before inviting to a more expensive ( in terms of both time and money ) in - person interview .
Joel 's writing on the in- person interview ( known as the Guerrilla Guide to interviewing ) is one of his best essays ever .
The most important part is to get the candidate to actually write some code during the interview .
I could n't agree more with that !
I 've done technical interviewing myself and found it to be an invaluable tool .
Not only to sort out programmers that simply do n't have it , but also to identify great ones .
In an in - person interview , personal traits obviously play a big role .
Code provides an honest way beyond those traits , but it has to be done in a fair and representative way .
I share much of Joel 's opinions on this matter ; avoid trivia questions that can be looked up on - line or in a reference manual and focus on the things that actually matter .
Joel deems it of vital importance to include a question on pointers and / or recursion .
In his experience , pointers and recursion are an aptitude , not a skill .
This has been controversial and I 'm not sure if Joel is correct .
But , it does n't really matter - if a programmer 's any good , he knows both concepts inside out .
The book spans a broad field and it's obvious that many things , like the location of your company , are beyond the control of most managers and technical interviewers .
Joel recognizes this and gives solid and honest no -nonsense advices .
Like all of Joel 's writings this book is humorous , interesting and a true joy to read .
I tend to disagree quite often with Joel 's technical opinions , but on the softer aspects of the business , he 's brilliant .
If you 're involved in the hiring process , this book will give you a lot of ideas and advices .

Rajkumari Devi ( right ) has vowed to protect Chhotu ( Photos : Dilip Raj )
A dog has appeared in court in the eastern Indian state of Bihar accused of breaching the peace .
Police demanded severe action against the dog for biting people .
Its owner says it has only attacked burglars .
The dog , named Chhotu , has been in trouble with the law before .
In 2003 , a magistrate sentenced Chhotu to death .
Neighbours complained he had gone mad and bitten several people .
But animal rights activists managed to get the decision reversed .
Sole protector Chhotu made his latest appearance in a crowded court on Thursday in the town of Purnea .
" The court was compelled to issue a summons to the dog since the police found that it was a threat to peace and feared that it might create a law and order problem , " district official Rajiv Ranjan said .
In court Chhotu appeared to have been on best behaviour .
Chhotu - no stranger to the courts " Despite the presence of so many people in the courtroom the dog did not bite or bark at anyone , " the canine 's lawyer Dilip Kumar Deepak said in defence of his client .
The case continues and Chhotu has been ordered to appear in court again on 5 August , together with his owner , childless widow , Rajkumari Devi .
Seven - year - old Chhotu was picked up off the streets by Rajkumari Devi 's mother , Janaki Devi .
Janaki
Devi died six months ago and since then Rajkumari Devi has kept the dog as her pet in her one - room thatched house .
" Chhotu is my sole protector and I 've brought him up as if he was my own child , " says Rajkumari Devi who says the dog has only bitten those who have tried to break into her house .
Her lawyer says Rajkumari Devi's jealous neighbours are trying to get their hands on her property .
" They want to steal the land papers which is why they have tried to break into her house in the night .
But they had to give up after being bitten by Chhotu , " he said .

There ’s a war going on , and Army Lt. Col.
J. Todd Breasseale has a mission .
But it ’s far removed from the captured Iraqi palace where he was once stationed .
He fights his war now from an office on Wilshire Boulevard lined with movie posters chronicling conflicts real and imagined , from “ Patton ” to “ War of the Worlds . ”
Breasseale ’s desk is piled high with scripts , each marked with his name and stamped “ confidential . ”
It ’s his job to help decide which movies should get Army help .
The mission is both harder and more important than it might appear .
Advertisement
After the Vietnam War , movies like “ Apocalypse Now ” and “ Born on the Fourth of July ” helped cement an image of psychologically damaged Vietnam veterans .
“ In the ‘ 80s and early ‘90s , the Vietnam War vet was the ‘ other , ’ ” Breasseale said .
“ Hollywood had created the crazy Nam vet . ”
For the Army , it was a bitter lesson .
With the country now enmeshed in another long , unpopular war , Breasseale is hoping to influence a new generation of filmmakers in order to avoid repeating the experience .
Advertisement
So far , Breasseale feels , most of the movies made about Iraq have really been about Vietnam .
“ It is the self - licking ice cream cone of Hollywood :
They make a war movie based on another war movie , ” Breasseale said .
“ It ’s important to tell the full story , not a story based on a weird Vietnam - era idea of what the military is like . ”
The Army has been helping filmmakers ever since it furnished aircraft and pilots for 1927 ’s “ Wings ” -- winner of the first best picture Academy Award .
With military assistance , moviemakers get access to bases , ships , planes , tanks and Humvees .
Military leaders also offer script advice .
Advertisement
And unless a filmmaker agrees to address any problems , the Pentagon generally opts out .
Most movies involving the military have been summer action films , like this year ’s “ Iron Man , ” which was made with Air Force help .
But Army officials are eager to work with filmmakers making serious movies about Iraq -- the kind of pictures that have the power to shape the public ’s view of the war and its warriors .
“ In the past , have there been instances of disagreements with scripts ?
Yes , ” said Maj .
Gen. Anthony A. Cucolo III , chief of Army public affairs .
“ The message I would send is : Give us a try . ”
Advertisement
The problem for military officials is that some in Hollywood see their script advice as a subtle form of censorship or an attempt to spin the war .
Paul Haggis , writer and director of the Iraq war movie “ In the Valley of Elah , ” said he concluded that the Army was not interested in telling honest stories about the war or soldiers .
“ They are trying to put the best spin on what they are doing , ” Haggis said .
“ Of course they want to publicize what is good .
But it does n’t mean that it is true . ”
Few directors focused on Iraq or Afghanistan have approached the military for help .
Haggis did .
Advertisement
Haggis said that after he submitted his script , the producers received 21 pages of objections to parts of the film .
Haggis , who did not review the notes , said his producers told him they amounted to a refusal to participate .
“ We needed their help , ” Haggis said .
“ If they had reasonable input I would have taken it .
But I am not there to do publicity for the Army .
I am there to do a movie that I see as true . ”
Military officers say flatly that they do not censor films .
“ There is no way that we are going to go in and to steamroll anyone ’s vision , ” said Phil Strub , the top Pentagon liaison to the film industry .
“ They will just tell us to drop dead and go away . ”
Advertisement
Officials will ask for changes , or decline to participate , if they believe military policies or practices are grossly misrepresented -- especially if a movie purports to be based on real - life events , as Haggis ’ film did .
Breasseale says movies about Iraq and Afghanistan have been one - dimensional .
“ There does n’t seem to be a lot of room for nuance , ” he said .
“ What sells a script to a studio is an easy concept , like ‘ This guy is crazy because he has been at war . ’
‘ Easy , I love it , ’ the executive says . ”
Breasseale is particularly critical of Brian De Palma ’s “ Redacted , ” a film released last year and based on a real - life incident in which U.S. soldiers raped an Iraqi girl , then murdered her and her family .
Breasseale , who was serving in Iraq at the time of the incident , says De Palma ’s movie intimates that all soldiers serving in Iraq are criminals .
Advertisement
“ It was so wildly offensive to me that he would group all soldiers together , ” Breasseale said .
De Palma did not respond to several requests for an interview .
Many Hollywood filmmakers reject the criticism of Iraq war movies .
Haggis said he worked hard to shade his portrayals of soldiers , even those who commit heinous crimes .
“ I did want to have a balanced and nuanced film , ” Haggis said .
“ If anything , I tried to be empathetic .
I try not to make these kids into villains . ”

Iraq war movies as a group have not done well at the box office .
Film critics have speculated that moviegoers see enough of war on the news or do n’t care to watch films about an ongoing conflict .
The Army suggests another possibility :
The public is rejecting films that feel didactic or inauthentic .
“ The public does not deal too well with being preached at , ” Breasseale said .
The military has assisted with one Iraq war film that officials hope will be unlike “ Redacted ” or “ In the Valley of Elah . ”
“ The Lucky Ones , ” due out in the fall , follows three combat - scarred soldiers as they travel from New York to Las Vegas .
The Army says the film -- which stars Tim Robbins , an outspoken war critic -- offers a more refined portrayal of soldiers .
Advertisement
During production , Robbins had a long conversation with Breasseale about what life might be like for his character , Staff Sgt. Cheever -- what would motivate an enlisted man through two combat tours in Iraq .
“ It captures the nuance .
It is not a broad brush stroke or just about PTSD ” -- post - traumatic stress disorder -- Breasseale said .
“ They manage to tell a story that is familiar but different . ”
Producer Rick Schwartz agrees his film is unlike other war movies .
It takes place almost entirely in America , and although it deals with the aftereffects of war , the word “ Iraq ” is never mentioned .
Schwartz hopes audiences draw their own conclusions about whether “ The Lucky Ones ” is pro-war or antiwar , he said .
Advertisement
Though some Iraq war movies have been influenced by post - Vietnam films , he said , makers of “ The Lucky Ones ” avoided Vietnam references .
“ You want to be able look back in 20 years from now and say , ‘ That ’s what was going on then , ’ ” Schwartz said .
“ We do n’t want to make a metaphor for any other war . ”
The tension between Hollywood and the Army may never fully dissipate .
But Breasseale is confident that he and officers who follow him will persuade more filmmakers to view them as a resource , not a censor .
Advertisement
“ I am the last of the eternal optimists .
I believe there is always a way to make things happen , ” Breasseale said .
“ My job is to help filmmakers tell an accurate story and help the American public understand their Army .
End scene . ”

Yesterday we reported that the bail date for OiNK administrator Alan Ellis and the six arrested OiNK uploaders was extended again .
New information , however , now shows that two of the six uploaders were released from further investigation and can get on with their lives .
While hundreds and thousands of filesharers in the UK receive a warning letter from their ISP this week asking them nicely to stop sharing copyrighted files , six members of the OiNK tracker have been waiting anxiously for the results of a criminal investigation .
There is some good news though , as two of the six – a 19 year old man and a 28 year old women – wont face any further charges , and now go free .
For the other four , and Alan Ellis himself , the wait continues .
Alan told TorrentFreak that his new bail date is set for September 10th .
Thus far , the police have not replied to our inquiries so it remains unclear why two of the six uploaders have been released from any charges .
The uploaders were arrested by detectives involved with ‘ Operation Ark Royal ’ this May , on suspicion of “ Conspiracy to Defraud the Music Industry ” and other copyright offenses .
No further arrests have been made since then .
OiNK was one of the largest private BitTorrent trackers , hosting hundreds and thousands of torrents .
The site was shut down in a joint effort by Dutch and British law enforcement in October 2007 , based on inaccurate intel from the IFPI and the BPI , two well known anti-piracy organizations .

AUSTIN , Texas --
During a panel here on whether to quit your job and pursue video blogging professionally , one audience member approached the microphone to ask a question .
Or was he an audience member ?
The guy had a video camera and was pointing it at himself as he spoke :
“ What advice do you have for aspiring video bloggers ? ” he asked .
“ What ’s your name ? ” asked panelist Lindsay Campbell of the online news show MobLogic.tv .
“ Brian Agosta dot com , ” answered the questioner , Brian Agosta .
“ Yeah , ” Campbell deadpanned , her main piece of advice nicely illustrated : “ Promote yourself . ”
This little scene captured a broader theme of South by Southwest Interactive , the portion of the festival here devoted to the neck - snappingly high - growth area of new media and online culture .
In the halls of the Austin Convention Center , you could n’t take three steps without tripping over a blogger , “ vlogger , ” podcaster or online TV show host of some kind .
There was so much recording , photo snapping and keyboard tapping that anyone who was n’t wielding a gadget looked just plain weird .
“ Everyone ’s a maker , ” said Veronica Belmont , the host of Mahalo Daily , a video podcast for techies , in reference to the number of conference attendees who were also covering the event -- or rather , the small number who were n’t .
“ It happens so often where we get bloggers interviewing bloggers , ” she said .
“ It ’s extremely meta . ”
Within a few minutes of leaving the auditorium where she had moderated her own panel , Belmont was waylaid by two different interviewers , video cameras at the ready .
One was Brian Tong of the online tech - news network CNet TV .
The second guy was . . . well , Belmont was n’t sure .
But whatever , right ?
The more , the merrier .
In fact , Belmont explained , the benefit of exhaustive mutual coverage makes sense if you consider the way websites become popular on the Internet :
In essence , the more references to your site out there , the more visible it becomes .
“ That whole premise kind of transfers into personal interactions , ” said Belmont .
“ Like , ‘ Oh , there ’s so - and - so , I ’m going to go interview them , so hopefully then they ’ll mention me on their blog , thus elevating my status as a blogger . ’ ”
And status is key to success in a media environment where anyone with a camera and a wi- fi connection can be a walking media outlet .
The problem that today ’s media aspirants face has less to do with getting published than with getting noticed .
Megan Adams , a press coordinator for “ South By ” -- as the veterans call it -- said last year ’s interactive conference had 100 registered press members .
But in a survey sent to more than 6,000 attendees , 937 people referred to themselves as media .
And , Adams said , there were twice as many registered press members this year .
We ’ll have to wait for the survey to see whether the number of unofficial press doubled too .
But no one ’s going to be surprised if it does .
In the tech world , standing out in a sea of media makers has become a key art form .
The people that succeed are part reporter , part performer and part networker .
In other words , get the story , infuse it with your persona and make sure everyone who ’s anyone knows about it when you ’re done .
The idea of so - called Internet fame frequently comes up in discussions here -- there was even a panel devoted to exploring what it means to be an online celebrity .
More than a few well - known bloggers showed up to discuss the meaning of “ microcelebrity ” -- commanding a loyal following among a narrow group of people -- with moderator Alice Marwick , who studies status in social media at New York University .
( The idea that Internet celebrities would attend a panel that attempted to hash out what Internet celebrity means speaks to the fuzzy definition of the subject . )
Among the ideas that emerged from the discussion were that traditional fame is a one - way proposition , whereas Web fame depends on an interaction between the celebrity and his or her fans .
But not everyone is sold on this new style of proactive , personality - centric media .
Megan McCarthy , a staff writer at Wired.com who covered the festival , said she preferred to avoid the spotlight and just concentrate on the journalism .
“ I think there are people who are not only trying to report the story but who want to become the story , ” she said .
And indeed , the conference ’s most talked about event was a keynote interview with tech - world rock star Mark Zuckerberg , the 23 - year - old founder of Facebook .
But it was his interviewer , BusinessWeek columnist Sarah Lacy , who ended up nabbing the headlines .
In an imperfectly calibrated bid to give the interview a personal tone , Lacy repeatedly took jabs at Zuckerberg , including references to his young age , a nervous tic of his and how he ’d once been so uncomfortable during an interview that he ’d “ sweated through his shirt . ”
During a tangent in which Lacy interrupted the talk to pick out a friend in the thousand - person audience who ’d been hanging out with her and Zuckerberg the night before , a heckler yelled :
“ Talk about something interesting ! ”
The crowd , clearly unsatisfied with the interview to that point , erupted in applause , and Lacy was on the defensive for the rest of the interview .
“ Can someone send me a message later about why exactly it was that I sucked so bad ? ” she said to the room .
“ What ’s your e-mail address ? ” someone replied .

BINDI , the Emmy - winning daughter of the late " Crocodile Hunter " Steve Irwin , is being made into a 25 - centimetre doll dressed in khakis and sporting binoculars , a camera and other outback gear , as well as a cockatoo , a wombat and a python .
In the talking version of the doll , Bindi uses phrases such as , " Crikey !
Let 's go help wildlife " , and , " You can make the world a better place " , the Plain - Dealer newspaper reported in Cleveland , Ohio .
The replica of the child star is part of a toy line being developed by Wild Republic .
The company began marketing a Steve Irwin doll several months after the Australian television host died from a poisonous stingray barb in his chest in September 2006 .
Greg Sargent has a report on a meeting of top Hillary fundraisers :
Fundraisers were given a presentation on Florida by Senator Bill Nelson , and one on Michigan by Senator Debbie Stabenow , and senior Hillary adviser Harold Ickes walked listeners through the challenges ahead .
The presentations had a tone of optimism tempered by realism , the fundraiser said , adding that Ickes did n’t try to persuade his listeners that she would be able to catch up with Obama in pledged delegates .
Rather , the clear message emerging from the presentations was that Hillary ’s success depends on the campaign ’s ability to persuade the super - delegates that they should be considering three “ data points , ” as this fundraiser puts it , in considering whom to back :
The pledged delegate count , the popular vote , and the specific states won by each candidate .
Okay , let ’s review : 1 ) Clinton ca n’t and wo n’t win the pledged delegate count ;
2 ) Hillary can’t and wo n’t win the popular vote ; and 3 ) Hillary has lost an overwhelming majority of the states .
By her campaign ’s own “ data points , ” it ’s over .
She ca n’t win the nomination and should n’t .
On NPR this morning , Hillary did add another firewall — Puerto Rico :
“ We ’ll wait and see where the voters go , ” Clinton says , when asked if she thinks the superdelegates should follow the lead of the popular vote .
“ I want to see what happens in Pennsylvania and Puerto Rico , Michigan and Florida . ”
Yes , Puerto Rico ( not Missouri , Virginia , Maryland , Connecticut , Maine , Washington , Wisconsin … ) is now a big part of her super - delegate strategy –even if that undermines her other argument that only a winning a few primaries in some big states matters .
The Clinton campaign is always re-setting the bar , cherry - picking what “ counts . ”
And , the punditry , loving the game and the ratings , plays along .
But , this game is dangerous .
The longer it goes on — the more “ kitchen sink ” the Clinton campaign throws — the worse it gets for Democrats .
The Clintons ca n’t win this fair and square .
She ca n’t win if she has to play by the rules .
That ’s why Harry Reid had to remind “ everyone ” that we ca n’t change the rules in the middle of the game .
The Clintons want the White House again .
They think it is theirs .
And , that ’s all that matters .
We have all heard about chil­dren who have Atten­tion Deficit / Hyperactivity Dis­or­der ( AD / HD ) .
Indeed , this con­di­tion seems to affect 5 to 8 % of school age chil­dren .
Have you ever won­dered what hap­pen to these chil­dren ?
As many as 60 % of them become adults pre­sent­ing AD / HD symp­toms !
Ron de Graaf and col­leagues recent­ly pub­lished a study in which they found that an aver­age of 3.5 % of work­ers ( in ten coun­tries ) meet the cri­te­ria for adult ADHD .
As you can imag­ine , being an adult with AD / HD can be a chal­lenge at work .
Before we explore this issue let ’s start by describ­ing the symp­toms of ADHD .
What is adult AD / HD ?
AD / HD is a dis­or­der of the brain .
Research clear­ly indi­cates that AD / HD is to a large extent genet­ic , that is it tends to run in fam­i­lies .
How­ev­er , AD / HD is a com­plex dis­or­der and oth­er causal fac­tors may be at play .
Typ­i­cal­ly , the symp­toms arise in ear­ly child­hood , unless they are asso­ci­at­ed with some type of brain injury lat­er in life .
Some peo­ple have mild AD / HD with only a few symp­toms while oth­ers have more seri­ous AD / HD with more symp­toms .
Symp­toms of inat­ten­tion ( adapt­ed from the DSM - IV )
* Fails to pay atten­tion to details
* Has dif­fi­cul­ty sus­tain­ing atten­tion
* Does not appear to lis­ten
* Strug­gles to fol­low through on instruc­tions
* Has dif­fi­cul­ty with orga­ni­za­tion
* Avoids or dis­likes tasks requir­ing sus­tained men­tal effort
* Los­es things
* Is eas­i­ly dis­tract­ed
* Is for­get­ful in dai­ly activ­i­ties
Symp­toms of hyper­ac­tiv­i­ty - impul­siv­i­ty ( adapt­ed from the DSM - IV )
* Fid­gets with hands or feet or squirms in chair
* Has dif­fi­cul­ty remain­ing seat­ed
* Dif­fi­cul­ty engag­ing in activ­i­ties qui­et­ly
* Acts as if dri­ven by a motor
* Talks exces­sive­ly
* Blurts out answers before ques­tions have been com­plet­ed
* Dif­fi­cul­ty wait­ing or tak­ing turns
* Inter­rupts or intrudes upon oth­ers
Before you start think­ing I knew it !
I have AD / HD .
One must have seri­ous symp­toms in dif­fer­ent areas of his or her life ( for exam­ple , do the symp­toms make it dif­fi­cult to do one´s job or cause prob­lems in one´s rela­tion­ships ? ) to be diag­nosed with AD / HD .
If you have a num­ber of symp­toms , but none are seri­ous , you wo n’t be diag­nosed with AD / HD .
How does AD / HD affect per­for­mance at work ?
Ron de Graaf and col­leagues recent­ly screened for AD / HD 7,075 18 – 44 year - old work­ers in 10 coun­tries ( Bel­gium , Colum­bia , France , Ger­many , Italy , Lebanon , Mex­i­co , the Nether­lands , Spain , and the Unit­ed States ) .
This was done in ten nation­al sur­veys in the WHO World Men­tal Health ( WMH ) Sur­vey Ini­tia­tive ( link to study below ) .
As men­tioned ear­li­er , 3.5 % of these work­ers turned out to have AD / HD .
Most of them were undi­ag­nosed and thus untreat­ed .
In the US , the per­cent­age increased to 4.5 % .
ADHD was more com­mon among men than women and more com­mon in devel­oped than devel­op­ing coun­tries .
Let ’s think about the AD / HD symp­toms and how they could inter­fere with work : Distractibility or inat­ten­tion
= Dif­fi­cul­ty to ignore exter­nal dis­trac­tions , such as peo­ple talk­ing or mov­ing
= Dif­fi­cul­ty to ignore inter­nal dis­trac­tion ( thoughts ) , which may lead to day­dream­ing
= Dif­fi­cul­ty man­ag­ing com­plex or long - term projects
= Dif­fi­cul­ty to find impor­tant papers and to turn in reports on time , which can cre­ate the impres­sion of care­less­ness
= Poor mem­o­ry result­ing from poor atten­tion
Hyper­ac­tiv­i­ty and Impul­siv­i­ty
= Dif­fi­cul­ty to stay still dur­ing meet­ings
= Tem­per out­bursts
= Dif­fi­cul­ty to lis­ten , ten­den­cy to inter­rupt , etc , which may cause inter­per­son­al issues
Evi­dent­ly , AD / HD symp­tom can indeed inter­fere with work .
Ron de Graaf and col­leagues found that work­ers with AD / HD spent more than 22 few­er “ role per­for­mance ” days per year ( includ­ing 8.7 days absent ) work­ing com­pared with non-AD / HD work­ers .
AD / HD work­ers said they could not car­ry out their rou­tine tasks .
Fur­ther­more , com­pared to women with­out AD / HD , women diag­nosed with AD / HD in adult­hood were found to be more like­ly to have depres­sive symp­toms , be more stressed and anx­ious , and have low­er self - esteem .
What can adults do if they think they present AD / HD symp­toms ?
They should see a doc­tor to seek diag­nos­tic and take appro­pri­ate med­ica­tions .
Per­haps try to struc­ture and orga­nize their envi­ron­ment dif­fer­ent­ly to help cope with the chal­lenges .
Per­haps find lit­tle ways to grad­u­al­ly train atten­tion .
In any case , this is an impor­tant mat­ter , for employ­ees , and for com­pa­nies .

ACLU amends lawsuit as Denver Democratic Convention ' free speech zone ' plans revealed Nick Langewis
Published : Tuesday July 1 , 2008
Print This Email This
The infamous " free speech zone , " set to make a comeback at Denver 's upcoming Democratic National Convention , needs to be within earshot of delegates , a coalition of civil liberties advocates backed by the ACLU said Monday .
Chain link fencing or chicken wire at the end of the parade route , about 700 feet away from the Pepsi Center under the current plan , would separate demonstrators and protesters from other convention attendees , the Rocky Mountain News reported .
The coalition have amended their pending lawsuit against the United States Secret Service and the City and County of Denver , filed in May , saying that the plan could violate the visitors '
First Amendment rights , echoing the corralling and effective silencing of protesters at the 2004 gala in Boston .
A judge in that case had ruled the " free speech zones " unconstitutional , but said that the suit was filed too late to order that plans be changed .
" No human voice , or any other sound , " ACLU counsel said in Monday 's amended complaint , " can ever hope to reach a person at the entrance . "
The case will go to trial on July 29 .
Preparations for the upcoming convention , for which Denver has been federally granted $ 50 million , may include military choppers , as seen during a mid-June Department of Justice drill , details of which could not be revealed by the Denver Police Department .
Lt. Nathan Potter , a military spokesperson with Special Operations Command , called the exercise " routine preparation for the global war on terrorism . "
Denver Sheriff division chief Marie Kielar also told Colorado Confidential in May that her department is preparing for convention - related arrests to top 1,200 .
The City and County of Denver will not make publicly available detention plans , such as where those arrested will be held , before the convention .
In addition to the May suit , the ACLU has demanded that the City and County make publicly available the procedures it plans to follow in processing those arrested at its downtown jail .
The Monday complaint called not only for a protest zone closer to the Pepsi Center , but also that it large enough to host all demonstrators , and for searches to be conducted only when there is probable cause .
" Simply put , we are going to abide by the Constitution , " Denver city attorney David Fine said Monday .

How to Make a Latte Like a Pro
The secret is in how you froth the milk , and we tell you how !
At the OSCON open source convention in Portland last week , Neuros CEO Joe Born explained how Linux - based embedded devices will bring open source to the set - top market and the consumer electronics space .
He also demonstrated how to build applications for the Neuros OSD , his company 's programmable DVR product .
We looked at Neuros last year when the company teamed up with TI to build an open source reference platform for TI 's DaVinci DSP hardware .
Neuros is building a community around the platform and has sponsored bounties to encourage third - party developers to participate in the process .
In our recent post - mortem of the HTPC concept , we noted that specialized set - top boxes are rapidly ascending to a position of dominance in the living room .
HTPC systems can't compete with media devices that are smaller , less costly , and more energy - efficient .
Neuros aims to offer a product and platform that can fill the set - top niche in an open and extensible way .
" The conventional view of convergence has largely been surrounding PCs , " said Born .
" But if you take a step back , you see a lot of things that PC is n't the answer for .
Embedded devices still remain cheaper . "
The growing ubiquity of Internet - enabled always - on consumer electronics products will change the way that people use technology , Born contends .
He believes this trend will create new opportunities for building an ecosystem of services and applications that are accessible to such devices .
He also notes that the high level of fragmentation that currently plagues this market has created a space where open source software can achieve some traction .
Software freedom will come to the masses through embedded devices , he says , not desktop computers .
The software stack
There is a lot more to the project than ideology , however .
The Neuros software platform is pretty darn cool .
It 's built on version 2.6.26 of the Linux kernel and uses VLC for its multimedia capabilities ( more details about the VLC port are available at the Neuros open source blog ) .
Neuros has legally licensed the codecs , so it can handle a variety of common proprietary formats .
The middleware stack developed by Neuros is distributed under the GPL .
Support for third - party application and service integration is extensive .
The platform offers a D - Bus interface for controlling media playback and has a full API for managing scheduled recording .
Neuros applications can be developed with Trolltech 's
Qt toolkit , which means that there is a clean glide - path for porting software from the desktop .
During the presentation , Born showed how to use the Qt graphical interface designer on a laptop running Ubuntu to build a program , which he then cross-compiled and ran directly on the Neuros .
The Neuros SDK provides a set of scripts that hide much of the complexity of cross-compilation , so the whole process was impressively seamless .
For developers who prefer a higher - level development path ( I personally prefer to avoid C++ whenever possible ) , the Neuros platform will support scripting in several different ways .
The current model of the OSD supports scripting with Lua , and the next - generation model will add Python with full Qt bindings .
For an even lighter development solution , the platform provides a framework for writing simple applications with web technologies .
This runs on top of an integrated WebKit HTML renderer which is also used for the Neuros browser .
Third - party stacks
It will also be possible to replace the default Neuros software stack with something completely different .
Developers can use the Neuros OSD boxes as testbeds for building new platforms .
Born hopes that users can eventually choose from a wide range of third - party stacks that offer a multitude of different capabilities .
For instance , it could eventually be possible to port other preintegrated media center solutions such as MythTV or XBMC so that they can run on the device .
Nokia 's recently - sponsored Ubuntu ARM port is another potential candidate for clever hackers who want to repurpose the OSD .
We have seen a lot of awesome stuff ported to ARM devices by members of the great Internet Tablet community ( such as Penguinbait ) , so it 's likely we will see lots of action around the OSD , too .
There is already a very real community forming around the device and it has some nice features , such as Last. fm integration and the Neuros web browser , that have been implemented by volunteer contributors and Google Summer of Code participants .
I 'm enthusiastic about the whole Neuros concept .
I own the current model of the OSD and I 'm really looking forward to the release of the next - generation product , which supports 720 p and is housed in a mini-itx case .
Born says that the 2.0 prototype units will be available for LinuxWorld , which is coming up next month .

Astronomy Picture of the Day Discover the cosmos !
Each day a different image or photograph of our fascinating universe is featured , along with a brief explanation written by a professional astronomer .
2008 March 8
Explanation :
The striking spiral galaxy M104 is famous for its nearly edge - on profile featuring a broad ring of obscuring dust .
Seen in silhouette against a bright bulge of stars , the swath of cosmic dust lanes lends a hat - like appearance to the galaxy in optical images suggesting the more popular moniker , The Sombrero Galaxy .
Here , Hubble Space Telescope archival image data has been reprocessed to create this alternative look at the well - known galaxy .
The newly developed processing improves the visibility of details otherwise lost in overwhelming glare , in this case allowing features of the galaxy 's dust lanes to be followed well into the bright central region .
About 50,000 light - years across and 28 million light - years away , M104 is one of the largest galaxies at the southern edge of the Virgo Galaxy Cluster .
" This is how you set up the monitoring ? " Shawn G. looked down at the system in disbelief .
There was a watchdog connected to a power relay to ensure that it was always running .
The power relay sat right next to the power switch in a sealed environmental enclosure .
Oh well , Shawn thought , this is what I 'm here to work on .
I 'll get this set up right .
He reached into the dark enclosure for the power switch to reboot the system .
And missed the switch .
Instead , he grabbed the relay contact , jumped back from the system yelling a word or two that would make a sailor blush , and waved his throbbing hand around .
One of his colleagues , arms aflail , ran around yelling " SAFETY OFFICER ! "
As Shawn sat there , rubbing his hand , he noticed the cover for the power relay sitting comfortably on a nearby table — he was n't sure why it was n't on the relay , but it explained the jolt .
Finally the safety officer was on the scene , spreading yellow tape and warning signs , marking each individual outlet and power switch with safety tags .
He sent Shawn to the staff nurse , gave him the workman 's comp paperwork , and an official incident report form .
The following week Shawn was summoned to a meeting with the safety commission — a humorless , perpetually frowning group that was clearly not happy about the incident .
The room seemed as though it was designed to intimidate Shawn .
He 'd sit opposite the group in a beat - up chair that sat directly under a bright light .
It was beginning to feel more like an interrogation than a meeting .
Of course , Shawn was feeling confident .
They could n't come after him for getting hurt by trying to turn on a computer since someone left electrical components exposed .
Unamusedly , a committee member spoke up .
" Do you have any authority under union regulations to operate power equipment ? "
Shawn thought and chose his words carefully .
" No , I do n't have that authority , but I am allowed to operate a power switch on a computer . "
" Ah , " one of the committe said while trying to grin , " but it is a power switch , and therefore it is power equipment , which falls under the electrical trades union agreement . "
The others similarly tried to grin , satisfied that they 'd avoided a lawsuit that day .
" It is therefore the finding of this committee that you have violated your authority under union regulations . "
How dare Shawn try to use the power switch without proper authorization ?
" A safety violation will be recorded on your permanent record . "
That 's where Shawn got freaked out a little .
Burn his Social Security card , tear up his high school diploma , ruin his credit score , but God help him if there 's another blemish on his permanent record !
He still has to live with the last incident that had gone on his permanent record , when he made fart sounds with his armpit during class in the second grade .
Shawn kept his copy of the incident report and swore to himself that he would n't let something like this happen again .
That afternoon he grabbed a stack of work order forms and filled one out .
********* WORK ORDER FORM ********* Employee Name : Shawn G. Work Date : 05/13/2008 5:00 PM
Work Performed By : Electrical Trade Union Action Requested : Please shut down my computer when I 'm ready to leave for the day .
...
Shawn urged his colleagues to do the same — after all , they 're not authorized .
Gradually , more and more people joined in and work orders were opened for the electrical union faster than they could be signed .
The staff needed computers turned on and off , light switches toggled , fans plugged in and unplugged , coffee makers turned on , radios turned off , pencils sharpened ( though analog sharpeners were OK ) .
It did n't take long for Shawn to get summoned to the director 's office .
" Funny thing , Shawn , " he began with a forced smile .
" Seems your safety citation got lost somewhere in the system , so your file is clean .
Aside from that fart noise thing . "
As Shawn was about to turn around and leave , the director added , " if you do n't mind , could you let people know that they can stop filing work orders for every power switch . "
The following month everyone became responsible for small electronics .
And they did n't even have to go through an equipment training session !
MONTREAL , July 12 ( UPI ) --
The French government told a Montreal newspaper a Quebec woman seeking French citizenship based on ancestral history is out of luck .
The Gazette ran a story Friday about Marie Mance Vallee 's bid to acquire French citizenship because her family arrived in Quebec in the 1650s and she has no sense of affiliation with Canada .
Advertisement
After the story was published , the French consulate in Montreal e-mailed the newspaper saying she is n't eligible for French citizenship because France lost the battle of the Plains of Abraham to Britain , and " anyone who lost citizenship because of a treaty or the cessation of territory is not eligible to reclaim their citizenship . "
However , the consulate e-mail said under certain circumstances , some people whose ancestors came from France after the 1763 signing of the Treaty of Paris could regain their citizenship .
The treaty officially ceded Quebec to the British .
The former president reveals what keeps his wife going – and what he thinks of Obama
“ I not only love her .
I honor the things she has done , ” former President Bill Clinton says of the person he hopes will be the next occupant of the White House : his wife , Hillary Rodham Clinton .
Speaking to PEOPLE on May 18 on the campaign trail in Oregon , Clinton provided his personal perspective on what is shaping up to be one of the toughest campaigns in recent memory .
Get push notifications with news , features and more .
Is it harder to campaign for Hillary than it was for yourself ?
No , for me in a way it ’s easier – except that it ’s harder for me not to talk too long because I get the feeling that if they all knew her like I do , she ’d get 80 percent of the vote .
What has the best part been ?
Chelsea ’s emergence has been the second best thing .
The most amazing thing is Hillary ’s ability to endure in the face of all the blows that have been rained on her : being outspent , dismissed , denigrated , declared dead
When I met her , I found that in her personal relationships she lacked self - confidence and was painfully shy .
She is having more fun now than at the beginning .
If you look at her , she seems perfectly relaxed , does n’t she ?
How often do you talk to Hillary during the day ?
Probably three times a day on the phone .
I got in the habit of not being an e-mailer when I was President because we had Newt Gingrich , who wanted to subpoena every e-mail ever written in the White House .
You ’ve called the campaign press coverage biased against Hillary .
Why do you think that is ?
I think most of the press people are in Obama ’s demographic .
They need a feeling more than they perceive they need a President .
There have been times when I thought I was literally lost in a fun house .
Were you surprised when Oprah Winfrey , one of your past supporters , backed Obama ?
No .
Oprah is from Chicago .
She was never going to be for anybody but Obama .
Many people say the race is over .
What keeps Hillary going ?
She just feels it ’s the right thing to do to just finish the course .
Let everybody vote .
Let every vote be counted and see where we are .
Will this fight go all the way to the convention ?
It depends on what happens between now and then .
It ’s been really funny that when all she asked was to let all the votes be counted , the response from the other side was to pressure as many superdelegates as possible , in districts mostly that she carried , to come out against her .
If Obama is the nominee , what will you and Hillary do to unite the party ?
There have been some rumbles about leaving this party divided but not one of them has come out of our camp .
Not one .
Ever .
She is our family ’s leader on political matters now .
I ’ll follow her lead .
Our life has been rich and good and full and will be .
And we love our country and want the best for it .
What do you think of Obama personally ?
Do you like him ?
I do n’t know him very well .
I did one event for him when he ran for the Senate .
He ’s an immensely talented man .
I think I understand him .
There are enough similarities in our childhoods and things that I think I get what he is doing .
But I do think it ’s better to have made a lot of decisions before you get to be President .
How do you respond to those who charge that you and Hillary have played the race card ?
I ’m not responsible for what other people say and what other people think .
I have lived too long .
All I can say is “ You line up what you ’ve done , I ’ll line up what I ’ve done , and we ’ll see who ’s got a good life . ”
I was really hurt about it at first .
I am way over being hurt .
This was cold - blooded , calculated , manipulated and a revolting strategy .
Any way you could have handled things better ?
The only thing I regret is saying any of this stuff late at night when I was tired , ’ cause if you are tired or angry , you should n’t be talking .
We needed to give ourselves Miranda warnings .
Is there anything you want voters to know ?
When I was so tired , I either was not as precise as I should have been or I seemed angrier than I would have been .
That ’s always a mistake .
If I am to have any blame , that ’s it .
Do you think you ever acted more like a husband than a politician ?
Probably a couple of times when I was mad .
What have you learned about Chelsea ’s political skills ?
We always respected her desire to appear enough to show she really loved her mother and supported her , but not in any way to undermine the independent business career she has .
It all changed after Iowa .
She realized her mother lost Iowa 100 percent because of younger voters .
She was upset , bawled , went into her employer and said , “ Look , you got to let me go or give me an indefinite leave of absence .
I ’m not letting my mother go down like this . ”
In a segment ending with the disclosure that " Fox News Sunday with Chris Wallace is brought to you by " The People of America 's Oil and Natural Gas Industry " and immediately followed by the American Petroleum Institute ( API ) front group 's misleading ad , the Fox News host seized on one of John McCain 's more recent flip - flops siding with President Bush 's recent call to rescind the ban on offshore oil drilling and asked over and over why McCain wo n't cave all the way to big oil and also allow for oil exploration in the Alaskan Arctic Wildlife Refuge , ANWR .

In the process of spewing talking points on behalf of his show 's sponsor , Wallace brings Obama into the discussion by joining the growing list of conservative dittoheads in the media who have been repeating this same false claim made by McCain last Tues. about oil spills and Hurricane Katrina :
Wallace : Obama talks about environmental damage from drilling offshore but the fact is the moratorium was put into effect in 1981 .
There 's been a lot of technological advances since then .
We had Hurricane Katrina go through the heart of the Gulf of Mexico and ravage these oil rigs and there were almost no oil spills , so what 's he talking about ? "
As ThinkProgress points out , that 's not true at all .
The truth is that Hurricane Katrina caused oil spillage so significant it was clearly visible from space .
It also wreaked environmental havoc near the scale of the 1989 Exxon Valdez disaster .
...
As Sen Reid correctly pointed out , this recent push by George Bush & John McBush represents " nothing more than a cynical campaign ploy that will do nothing to lower energy prices , and represents another big giveaway to oil companies already making billions in profits . " and the NYT went further to note that " the only real beneficiaries will be the oil companies that are trying to lock up every last acre of public land before their friends in power -- Mr. Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney -- exit the political stage . "
In fact , the oil industry has yet drilled in just 19 percent of the more than 40 million acres they already can that are not covered by the current ban -- 40 million acres that represent 79 percent of America ’s technically recoverable offshore oil reserves .
Using generous estimates from the latest analysis from Bush 's own Department of Energy , allowing for unlimited drilling both offshore and in ANWR " would lower the price at the pump by less than 6 cents by 2025 . "

While everyone throws a fit over Apple and AT&T ’s tricky pricing for the iPhone 3G , the real travesty in pricing is slipping by largely unnoticed : AT&T is including no text messages in its iPhone 3G monthly plans .
This means that on top of your cellular plan , and on top of your new 3G data plan , you will need to purchase a text messaging plan .
This is a rip - off of epic proportions .
Lets think about this for a minute .
What is a text message ?
It ’s a relatively tiny amount of data ( 160 characters or fewer ) that is sent using the short messaging service ( SMS ) .
With the iPhone ’s unlimited data plan , which includes everything but texting , you ’re probably sending hundreds of megabytes , and soon gigabytes , of data each month for $ 20 - $ 30 .
Yet to send 200 of these 160 - character text messages , it will likely be $ 5 to $ 10 extra a month .
A text message is data , and a very small amount of it .
So why am I paying so much extra — let alone anything extra for it ?
This seems like it would be a perfect candidate for one of those “ Fleecing of America ” segments that run on the NBC Nightly News — except that it ’s arguably worse in the rest the world .
Of the 2.3 trillion text messages are expected to be sent this year , the United States represents a relatively small percentage with “ only ” 300 billion sent .
Not surprisingly , China is the largest market for the messages , with well over 500 billion sent .
Mobile companies are making billions of dollars off of these messages .
Even worse is that carriers effectively double charge for each message .
They charge both the sender and recipient of each one .
In the United States these messages usually cost around 10 cents per message but can go as high as 25 cents a message without a pre-paid plan .
If you ’re anything like me , you ’re going to use many more than just 200 messages included in a bare - bones plan .
Like many first generation iPhone owners , I signed up with the default 200 messages that were included in the original plans .
One month I overshot this by 350 messages , and I would hardly consider myself a heavy text messenger .
But the iPhone seems to do that .
Just as it has spurred use of the Internet on mobile phones , the iPhone has made text messaging very appealing to me .
One reason is that I actually have a keyboard now instead of using that bogus T9 typing mechanism all of my previous phones had .
And the other is that Apple makes text messaging look just like its iChat application , with conversations threaded just like an IM .
I use text messaging on the iPhone now just like I use IM .
This is a major problem when I only have 200 messages I can send or receive — and each one after that is 10 cents a message .
I upgraded my plan to 1500 messages , but under this new iPhone 3G payment structure , this is likely to add around $ 20 to my monthly bill .
Everyone is all up in arms over the $ 10 raise for 3G data plan , what about the extra $ 20 many of us are going to have to pay ?
Perhaps one of the companies building applications will come up with a way to circumvent this ridiculous charge for text messages .
During Apple ’s SDK road map event , AOL was unveiled as partner to bring its AOL Instant Messenger program to the iPhone , but we did n’t hear anything about it at WWDC .
Hopefully that is still in the cards , because it could be exactly what I ’m looking for — assuming that Apple ’s new Push Notification Service works as well as advertised .
Instant messaging on phones with unlimited data plans such as the iPhone could easily kill text messaging .
And it should , because I do n’t want to keep paying for unlimited data only to have it be limited to certain kinds of data .
Text messaging almost makes the mobile industry ’s other scam , the ringtone , look like a deal .
And it makes that $ 10 a month extra on your iPhone bill for 3G data look like a steal .

Lots of useful and interesting information about gardening
Ever heard of International Day For Biological Diversity ( IDB ) ?
The United Nations declared May 22nd the offical date this year , and Invasive Alien Spieces and their threat to biodiversity is the theme this year .
Invasive Aliens Species are widely recognized as a major component of human - induced global environmental change .
Globalization allows that the transportation of animals , plants and microorganism to provide a variety of goods and service , travel opportunities , as well as contributing to our personal well - being .
It has also created entryways for invasive alien species to enter , establish and spread to new habitats and ecosystems .
Climate change , disturbance and modification of landscape is also know as casing further spreading and impact of invasive alien species on a wide range of ecosystems .
These biological invasions by invasive alien species oftentimes result in economic losses and decreased biological diversity and ecosystem function .
In the U.S. alone , the yearly damage and control cost of invasive species is estimated at over $ 138 billion …. worldwide , the estimate is at 1.4 trillion — annually !
Another shocking statistic ?
Invasive alien species have contributed to almost 40 % of all animal extinctions for which the cause is known .
So how do they spread ?
Both intentionally and unintentionally .
Natural ecosystems that have undergone human - induced disturbance are often more susceptible to alien invasions because there is less competition from native species .
An example is the red fire ant .
They are more successful in establishing themselves in disturbed areas such as roadsides and agricultural fields .
They rarely colonized intact closed forests .
The movement of ships ( and water ) provides pathways for the movement of marine organisms from country to country and sea to sea .
Hundreds of species can be found alive in samples taken from a single ship .
People also have been known to introduce invasive alien species when they accidentally or knowingly release fish and plants into ponds , or flush them down the toilet … this ensures they find their way into local water systems .
Organisms may also hitchhike in or on timber , packaging , machinery equipment and vehicles .
Items such as these are often shipped from place to place without cleaning .
Airplanes also may allow species to move inside the cabin in passenger clothing , luggage , cargo , or aircraft parts .
People may also transport species on soil - contaminated equipment , and bring home plants , plant parts or live animals , or food items such as fruits which may carry invasive insects or microbes .
Many important crops and trees ( including plants for biofuel production ) are grown in areas outside their natural distribution for effective food production .
Sometimes when growing crops , biological control ( a pest control strategy ) using living natural enemies may be implemented .
Oftentimes these exotic species which are used to control pest species , can become invasive pest species themselves .
To give you a larger perspective of invasive species impact on people and environments , one can look at history :
1 . The Irish potato famine in the 1840 ’s was caused by a fungus introduced from North America .
2 . The viruses causing smallpox and measles spread from Europe to the Western Hemisphere right after colonization .
The low resistance of indigenous peoples to these parasites played a part in bringing down the Inca and Aztec empires .
3 . The Nile perch :
As the population grew and fishing techniques improved on Lake Victoria in Africa , by the 1950 ’s overfishing caused a drastic decline in fish stocks .
To reverse this , the British introduced the Nile perch and Nile tilapia .
With no natural predators and lots of prey , they flourished … and 200 species became extinct .
The Nile perch ( oilier than the other fish ) required the locals to dry them over a fire before eating .
More trees were used to do this , which resulted in deforestation .
The deforestation caused increase erosion and runoff , which raised nutrient levels in the lake .
This promoted infestation by water hyacinth .
Climate change also plays its part in the introduction of invasive alien species .
Increasing ocean temperatures facilitates marine alien species invasions by increasing the magnitude of their growth .
This facilitate a shift to dominance by aliens .
Climate change is predicted to affect marine organism by :
1. Increasing ocean temperatures
2. Increasing Sea levels
3. Changing ocean circulation
4. Decreasing ocean salinity
So many factors directly alter conditions and contribute in some way as a threat to biodiversity .
I know that the first colonist that landed at Plymouth rock were determined to arrive , survive ( that first harsh winter ) , and thrive – but alien species moving into your own backyard which are able to arrive , survive and thrive , impact your own well - being , your community , and what ’s left for future generations .
Do n’t forget the International Day for Biological Diversity this Friday May 22nd !

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - The Senate was on course for a Saturday vote to approve a major housing market rescue bill offering a lifeline to mortgage finance giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , and bond market action on Thursday indicated investors were encouraged by the progress .
The depth of the housing market slump and its impact on the U.S. economy was underscored , at the same time , by new data showing the pace of sales of existing homes hit a 10 - year low and by more bank losses on real estate setbacks .
Bill Gross , chief investment officer of Pacific Investment Management
Co , the world ’s biggest bond fund known as Pimco , said the housing bill -- expected to be signed into law soon by President George W. Bush -- was “ the best way to begin the long journey back to normalcy . ”
Fannie and Freddie , both government - sponsored enterprises , or GSEs , own or guarantee nearly half of the $ 12 trillion in outstanding U.S. home mortgage debt and are playing an increasingly crucial role as the housing market struggles through its worst downturn since the Great Depression .
The bill was drawing bipartisan support in the Senate , despite some efforts to block it .
On Wednesday , the House of Representatives approved the bill by a 272 - 152 vote , hours after Bush dropped a threat to veto the election - year measure .
New Hampshire Republican Sen. Judd Gregg , speaking on the Senate floor , called the housing bill “ a necessary step .
...
This is something we ’re simply going to have to do . ”
A handful of Senate Republicans were trying to amend and delay the bill .
But they will run out of options on Saturday , allowing the Senate to vote , said aides from both parties .
A last - minute deal could bring an earlier vote on Friday , but lawmakers and aides said that looked unlikely .
Senate Banking Committee Chairman Christopher Dodd , a Connecticut Democrat , said the bill was “ about to pass , I believe . ”
The bill would offer new emergency financing to Fannie and Freddie , the nation ’s largest mortgage finance companies , while setting up a new regulator for them and creating a Federal Housing Administration fund to help thousands of distressed homeowners refinance into more affordable mortgages .
Shares of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , meanwhile , tumbled on Thursday amid a broad stock market sell - off as the slowing home sales reported by the National Association of Realtors prompted investors to take profits in financial shares , after a rally over the past week .
Fannie closed off 19.9 percent at $ 12.02 on the New York Stock Exchange ; Freddie shares fell 18.4 percent to $ 8.81 .
MORTGAGE RATES SPIKE
With Congress hoping that its measure would restore some economic stability , a survey released on Thursday by Freddie Mac reported that U.S. mortgage rates spiked upward this week amid fears of rising inflation , housing market weakness and possible Federal Reserve short - term interest rate increases .

Regional bank National City Corp , based in Cleveland , posted a $ 1.76 billion second - quarter loss on Thursday , hurt in part by real estate loan losses .
Although the housing bill has boosted stock market confidence in the GSEs ’ ability to ride out the housing slump , other news on Thursday drove home to investors the severity of the problems ahead , said Michael Cheah , portfolio manager at AIG SunAmerica Asset Management in Jersey City , New Jersey .
“ The big picture is that home prices are still going to drop more , even from here , ” Cheah said .

As shares sold off , risk premiums on Fannie and Freddie agency notes narrowed , with yield spreads as much as 8 basis points tighter on Thursday , indicating debt markets were encouraged by Congress ’ progress with the housing bill .
New York Federal Reserve Bank President Timothy Geither told a House committee on Thursday that recent financial crises justify big changes in financial oversight at Fannie and Freddie , a project that lawmakers are targeting for 2009 .
Securities and Exchange Commission Chairman Christopher
Cox told the same hearing his agency would soon offer a proposal to expand emergency curbs on short selling of 19 financial stocks , including Fannie and Freddie , to the entire market .
In the Senate , hopes for a quick housing bill vote faded on Wednesday when South Carolina Republican Sen. Jim DeMint tried to attach an amendment opposed by Democrats .
Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid , a Nevada Democrat , invoked a procedural tactic to limit debate , which set up a stand - off with DeMint , whose ability to block a final vote will expire by Saturday .
On Friday , the House Financial Services Committee will hold a hearing on the role of mortgage servicers in the market .
