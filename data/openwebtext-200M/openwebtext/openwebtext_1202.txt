What happened ... my friends and I were standing ( with our hands in our pockets ) in Section 113 Row 1 ( end zone behind FG posts ) while the Broncos were on D and were told by the Ravens staff to sit down .
Jon Cline ( VP of Ravens security ) told us we 're " outta here " if we stand up again .
He said we could only stand up on a " majority rules " basis and said it was grey .
He said we could only stand up on " things like 3rd downs or celebrating a touchdown " .
Well we were eventually tossed midway through the 2nd quarter for standing with our hands in our pockets ( well aware we had many eyes on us and trying to be model fans AND yell for the Broncs ) while the Broncos were on 3rd down .

When Laurier LaPierre was named to the Senate many years ago , it ensured that the former Vancouver journalist 's financial woes were over forever .
Pat Carney is another former journalist who made it to the Senate .
However , she quit her career at the Vancouver Sun and moved into electoral politics long before her leap into one of the most cushy jobs in the country .
In recent years , many more media people have won the equivalent of the lottery by being named to the upper chamber .
Former Montreal Gazette editor Joan Fraser is just one of a wave of appointments in recent years .
Jean Chretien put her in the Senate in 1998 after Conrad Black 's company fired her .
Chretien also named Jim Munson , a former CTV reporter , to the Senate .
First , Chretien hired him as a press secretary — after he was cut loose from CTV — before giving him the ultimate political reward .
Harper has named Pamela Wallin ( who spent time in between journalism and the Senate as a diplomat in New York ) , former CTV talk - show host Mike Duffy , and , yesterday , former National Post columnist Linda Frum Sokolowski to the Senate .
Sokolowski's brother is David Frum , a former George W. Bush speechwriter .
Duff Conacher at Democracy Watch has criticized what he calls the " revolving door " .
This is when political aides and politicians become lobbyists on behalf of special interests shortly after leaving government .
The problem with the revolving door is that it creates an incentive for politicians and political aides to try to curry favour with those special interests .
They know that if they play their cards right , they wo n't have to worry about finding employment when their government service ends .
Now , we 're in the strange situation of having a revolving door for journalists .
If they do n't step on too many toes , they know they might be in a position to land in the Senate , thanks to the actions of recent prime ministers .
I have no doubt that some of these former journalists are excellent senators .
LaPierre and Carney both worked exceptionally hard during their tenure .
That 's not the point .
The issue is the revolving door — and how prime ministers are creating incentives for some journalists to suck up to them .
It 's got to stop .
The group that went on the trip was a mixed group of bloggers and a conventional reporter -- Elizabeth Brackett from PBS .
This is a photo of some of us .
I should mention that while I went on the trip with API , the sources I am using in these two posts are broader than just information on the trip .
I will link to some of these sources as I go along .
Arguably this post is mostly from the point of view of oil companies , but it seems to me our knowledge base regarding oil sands is so poor that we need to start somewhere .
This is the first in a two - part series about Canada 's oil sands .
In this post , I will talk about a recent American Petroleum Institute ( API ) - sponsored media trip I made to see Canada 's oil sands , and give a little background on material being extracted .
In the second part of the series , I will talk about future oil sands production and some issues related to future imports , including environmental questions .
Trip information
On our trip , we visited :
• Syncrude 's open pit mining and upgrading operation north of Ft. McMurray .
This is a joint venture involving several companies .
• ConocoPhillips Surmont's in situ project using Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage ( SAGD ) technology , south of Fort McMurray .
• The Oil Sands Discovery Centre museum in Ft. McMurray .
We also heard a talk by Don Thompson of the Oil Sands Developers Group called Setting the Record Straight .
After we got home , we talked on the phone with Robert Renner , Alberta 's Commissioner of the Environment .
A transcript and audio recording is available at this link .
Oil Sands -- What is It ?
Oil sands material is funny stuff .
It reminded me of a very dark crumbly brownie , but smelled like asphalt .
Structure of oil sands resource , from display at the Oil Sands Discovery Centre museum in Ft. McMurray , Alberta , Canada .
According to this graphic , oil sands are a complex mixture of quartz sand , silt , clays , water , trace metals , and bitumen .
In this mixture , each grain of sand is surrounded by a water mixture .
Bitumen fills the space between sand particles and their water coverings .
What makes Canada 's Oil Sands different from many other deposits of heavy oil is the water layer surrounding the sand , making them " water wet , " or hydrophilic .
Because Alberta 's oil sands are water wet , the " bitumen can be extracted using relatively inexpensive hot or warm water processes " according to small print on the poster above .
When the bitumen is separated out from the oil sands mixture , it has somewhat the consistency of cold molasses .
I touched some of it in a vial , and could n't get it off my finger without using a solvent .
The API gravity is 8 .
Bitumen molecules are much larger than what one finds in conventional oil , containing as many as several thousand atoms .
The ratio of hydrogen is similar to that of heavy conventional oil .
According to J. G. Speight , hydrogen content of bitumen averages 10.4 % , compared to a range of 10.0 % to 14.0 % for petroleum .
Sulfur content averages 5 % , making it " sour " .
Methods of Producing Oil from Oil Sands
Mining -- Illustrated at Syncrude
The oldest and still most widely used method of producing oil from oil sands is mining .
This method is gradually being refined , to become more energy efficient , to use less water , and to have less environmental impact in general .
In the mining method Syncrude uses , the various surface layers are first removed and stored so that they will be available when needed for reclamation .
Then large equipment is used to scoop the oil sands material out , and load it into large trucks .
Open pit mining operation at Syncrude
Next , the material is transferred by truck to a station where it is mixed with water to form a slurry .
Hydrotransport pipelines transport the slurry mixture from the mine to the extraction plant .
The slurry is fed into a separation vessel where it separates into three layers -- sand , water and bitumen .
The sand that separates out is trucked to its assigned location , based on a reclamation plan that Syncrude filed earlier with the province .
Syncrude says that it plans carefully where each truckload of material goes , so it does not need to move material twice , and thereby increase its costs .
The water ( including dissolved minerals , clay , and small amounts of bitumen mixed with the water ) that separates out is transferred to tailings ponds .
The water from these tailing ponds is then recycled , for use with a new batch of bitumen slurry .
With recycling , the amount of water from Athabasca River that Syncrude uses has been decreasing , and now averages 2.03 barrels of water per barrel of finished product .
Over 85 % of the water used in this process is recycled .
The bitumen that separates out during the separation process is upgraded to form Synthetic Crude Oil ( SCO ) , a light sweet crude oil that sells for about the same price as the benchmark crude , West Texas Intermediate ( WTI ) .
This upgrading takes place in a facility that in many ways resembles a refinery ( cracks the molecules into shorter ones and separates out sulfur and other pollutants ) , but does not produce the finished products of a refinery .
Since the upgrading is at the same location where oil sands are mined , Syncrude can make use of the natural gas and other gasses produced in the upgrading process to provide some of the energy required for the energy needs of the facility .
I was told that approximately two - thirds of the energy needs of the facility are internally generated , but I have not received written confirmation that this is the case .
Work on reclamation goes on at the same time as mining .
Once sufficient sand has been added to reach the planned contours of the reclaimed area , the upper layers are put back and native vegetation planted , according to the plans filed with the province .
These plans are updated from time to time to reflect changes in thinking regarding optimal revegetation .
One piece of Syncrude land in an intermediate stage of reclamation -- not yet approved by the province .
Of all of the oil sands operators , Syncrude has the only parcel of land that has been officially been certified as reclaimed .
It also has 4,600 hectares that would look to a passer - by as reclaimed , but has not passed the years - long process required by the province to show that reclaimed area fully meets the province 's standard in terms of stability , plant growth , water areas , and wildlife .
Another piece of Syncrude land in an intermediate stage of reclamation - - wood bison ( native species to the area ) are being raised here .
I was told that the energy return of this process is 6:1 , presumably all of the way from mining to production of Synthetic Crude Oil ( SCO ) .
I was told that many of the processes are gradually being made more efficient , at Syncrude and more generally .
For example , Syncrude invented low energy extraction which reduced the temperature required to extract bitumen from 80 C to 40 C .
As techniques are refined to become more energy efficient , one would expect the energy return ratio to increase , and the amount of CO2 generated by the processes to decline .
I was also told that 92 % to 94 % of the bitumen in the oil sands is extracted in this process -- a very high percentage , compared to conventional oil extraction .
In some sense , what happens is that the oil sands material is scooped out , nearly all of the bitumen washed out , and the remaining material ( mostly white sand ) put back .
Water to be recycled plus various impurities are put into tailing ponds .
The material that cycles through tailing ponds does n't get to its final location very quickly , and sometimes ends up where it is not wanted , so is a problem the industry and regulators are working on .
I might mention that workers who live in Ft. McMurray ride on company buses to work .
The buses pick them up near their homes .
Other workers live in a camp on site .
I was told by a company employee how much he liked Ft. McMurray because of the cosmopolitan environment , with workers from around the world .
A person I met who used to work in Ft. McMurray commented that drugs are a problem , since the area tends to be young and transient .
In Situ Production
While mining is still the largest source of oil sands production , in situ production is catching up .
According to statistics of Canadian Association of Petroleum Producers ( CAPP ) , a little over 40 % of Alberta 's Oil Sands production in 2007 was in situ or " in place " production .
In situ production has several advantages over mining :
• Less disturbance of the soil -- digging only for pipes , roads , buildings , and equipment ;
• Less water use , and water that is used is sometimes from brackish sources ;
• Little need for land reclamation .
The material just stays where it is .
The bitumen is in some way melted and drained out ;
• Less ( and in some cases no ) tailings ponds .
The primary in situ approach in use today is Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage ( SAGD ) which I will discuss shortly .
Cyclic Steam Simulation is also used to a lesser extent .
In addition , there are several other in situ approaches under development , including electric induction technologies , in situ combustion , and vapor extraction process ( similar to SAGD , but using a solvent other than water ) .
See Oil Sands
Story for discussion of some of these methods .
Illustration of Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage ( Devon ) .
In SAGD operations , steam is injected through the upper ( injection ) well .
The steam melts the bitumen , and the melted bitumen plus moisture are collected in the lower ( producing ) well .
Steam Assisted Gravity Drainage ( SAGD ) at Surmont
At the Surmont facility , the wells gathering the bitumen mixture are 1,000 feet deep , which is below the groundwater and a limestone cap .
Each well is about 3,000 feet long .
The surface area is mostly forested , except where equipment is located and where above - ground pipelines run .
Surmont uses brackish ( salty ) water from deep wells to generate steam .
The water is heated to 200C , and piped to the injector wells ( see diagram above ) .
The steam escapes from holes in the injector wells and heats the area around the injector well .
The bitumen melts , and the melted bitumen and water from the steam drip down and are collected in the producer wells , found below the injector wells .
Surmont estimates that it collects 60 % of the bitumen in place using this process .
The steam does n't actually get everywhere -- in the locations it does go , Surmont estimates it extracts 92 % to 94 % of the bitumen in place .
In this process , the vast majority of sand and other materials are left in place , so there is much less material to process , and no need to worry about major land reclamation later .
Samples of source water and water being recycled at Surmont
Surmont recycles its water , so that 90 % of the water it uses is recycled .
The amount of additional brackish water that needs to be added averages 0.25 barrels per barrel of bitumen -- much less than required for mining approaches .
Since it uses brackish water , none of this water comes from the Athabasca River .
Before Surmont began producing bitumen in 2007 , it drilled delineation wells to determine the extent of the resource and to lay out plans for where extraction would be performed .
In drilling the delineation wells , it was necessary to cut down some trees .
We were told that Surmont is now in the process of reforesting areas where delineation wells were drilled , under its faster forests program .
The bitumen that is produced at Surmont is too stiff to transport by pipeline , once it cools from initial extraction .
To overcome this difficulty , Surmont buys SCO ( perhaps made at Syncrude ) and blends it 50 % - 50 % with bitumen to produce the petroleum product it sells -- Western Canadian Select Blend .
I was told that the energy return of this process is also 6:1 .
Upon inquiring further , I found that this energy return is only based on the amount of natural gas the process uses -- one cubic meter of natural gas to one cubic meter of bitumen .
If other fuels were included , the energy return would no doubt be lower .
Also , this energy return only relates to making bitumen to blend with SCO , so would seem to be less than the mining energy return .
It is clear to me that there are a lot of indirect energy costs that would be hard to count in any calculation .
For example , Surmont is located an hour 's drive south of Ft. McMurray , away from any town .
All water for drinking is bottled water that is shipped in .
I was told that some of the other in situ sites are " fly in " sites , where the only access is helicopters .
All of the pieces of buildings , pipelines , and processing equipment must be flown in to these sites .
Housing and food service is provided at these remote locations , in the same way it would be on a floating oil platform .
More in Part 2 later .
Note : Oil sands vs Tar sands .
The province of Alberta and CAPP prefer oil sands , so that is the terminology I have used .
Oil sands is also far more commonly used , according to Google .

Barbados and Cuba have paid homage to the victims of the 1976 bombing of a Cubana Airlines jet off the coast of Barbados that killed all 73 people on board , lamenting the fact that the masterminds of the attack were never convicted .
Cuba ’s Ambassador to Barbados , Lisette Perez Perez , told the wreath laying ceremony on Sunday that what happened to the Cubana passenger plane on October 6 , 1976 was not an isolated incident .
She said that the masterminds behind of the attack , Orlando Bosch and Luis Posada Carriles were never convicted for this criminal act .
“ Bosch passed away peacefully in Miami , where he lived in complete freedom ( and ) impunity , after being granted presidential pardon by ( President ) George Bush , which was negotiated by the Cuban far - right wing .
A similar treatment was given to the other perpetrator of this abominable crime .
Carriles was neither charged nor prosecuted in the United States , ” she said .
The Cuban diplomat thanked Barbados for its support saying “ there is a history of injustice in the waters of Paradise Beach in Barbados .
“ The cold–blooded murder of the people on board that passenger plane was a crime against them , their families , and their countries .
It was also a crime against Barbados and its people , ” she added .

On October 6 , 1976 , anti-Castro terrorists murdered seventy - three people on Cubana Flight 455 off Barbados .
Declassified letters and reports ( like below from FBI Director Clarence M. Kelley to Henry Kissenger ) show that the United States Government knew of the plot beforehand and not only that : they knew exactly who was involved almost four months before the bombing .
For over three decades the US government has protected the terrorists .
This outrage continues under the Obama Administration and undermines whatever moral authority the United States retains in the persecution of its war in Iraq – a “ part - time hobby ” war with no end in sight .

Revisiting the Cuban tragedy
By Rickey Singh
THIRTY - FOUR years ago today , terrorists blew up a Cubana passenger aircraft off Barbados , killing all 73 people on board , mostly Cubans but including 11 Guyanese and five North Koreans on their way to Havana .
For many years since that unprecedented Cubana tragedy in Caribbean airspace , there have been calls by the governments of Cuba and Venezuela , as well as Caricom , for the perpetrators to be brought to justice .
Specifically identified for a court trial has been the Cuban emigre Luis Posada Carriles , who had also acquired Venezuelan citizenship before his documented involvement as one of the primary plotters of the Cubana disaster and other escapades in terrorism .
Another of the plotters , exposed for his notorious roles in terrorism and link with the CIA in the Caribbean - Latin Americas region , including Chile under President Salvador Allende , was Orlando Bosch .
Like Posada , he continues to enjoy sanctuary in the USA — the superpower that never fails to remind the world of its commitment to democracy and the rule of law .
Long before Barack Obama wrote his name into 21st century history as the first - ever African - American US President and raised hopes for “ fundamental changes ” in how America conducts business at home and abroad , Caricom governments had appealed , in the name of justice and human decency , for Posada to face trial .
But , as had happened years earlier , in the case of Posada ’s compatriot in crime , Bosch , there has been no such move by the justice administration system in the US .
On the contrary , since 1988 , in the face of the decision by a US judge for his deportation as a terrorist , “ unfettered by law and human decency ” , Bosch was to be taken into Uncle Sam ’s protective political care — thanks to the presidential pardon received from the elder George Bush as then occupant of the White House .
Disclosures of the terroristic activities of both Bosch and Posada as agents of the CIA working with the anti-Fidel Castro community of Cuban exiles has been accessed from records of the CIA and Federal Bureau of Investigations ( FBI ) themselves .
Today , therefore , as the people of Barbados and the rest of Caricom join Cuba in silent remembrance of the victims of the Cubana tragedy , it would be difficult to ignore the double standard , the sheer political hypocrisy , of “ Uncle Sam ” in its selective execution of bilateral extradition treaties .
The classic example , best known by Jamaicans , and too recent for the entire Caricom region to ignore , is the extradition case involving Christopher “ Dudus ” Coke , currently a prisoner of the US on charges of drug trafficking and gun-running .
This internationally publicised extradition of a Jamaican drug lord , that resulted from extreme pressures by Uncle Sam , has posed tremendous problems for the authorities in Kingston with current debate on its ultimate impact on the longevity of the Bruce Golding administration .
Yet , in sharp contrast , and with no intent to rationalise criminality , it is quite relevant to note the utter hypocrisy of the US in how it responds to extradition cases .
Currently , while the people and government of Jamaica are coping with the consequences of uprooting , on Uncle Sam ’s demand , Coke from his Tivoli Gardens stronghold and extradite him for trial in America , there continues to be open contempt by US authorities for the requested extradition by both Cuba and Venezuela , of Posada Carriles — if not Bosch as well — for involvement in the Cubana tragedy 34 years ago today .
There needs to be a response from the “ time - for - change ” President Obama to revisit the cases of the two Cuban emigres being protected in America and known to be integrally linked with the Cubana tragedy as agents of the CIA .
The statements of a Belgian man believed to be in a coma for 23 years , but recently discovered to be conscious , are poignant , but experts say they may not be his words at all .
Rom Houben 's account of his ordeal , repeated in scores of news stories since appearing Saturday in Der Spiegel , appears to be delivered with assistance from an aide who helps guide his finger to letters on a flat computer keyboard .
Called " facilitated communication , " that technique has been widely discredited , and is not considered scientifically valid .
" If facilitated communication is part of this , and it appears to be , then I do n't trust it , " said Arthur Caplan , director of the University of Pennsylvania 's Center for Bioethics .
" I 'm not saying the whole thing is a hoax , but somebody ought to be checking this in greater detail .
Any time facilitated communication of any sort is involved , red flags fly . "
Facilitated communication came to prominence in the late 1970s after an Australian teacher reportedly used it to communicate with 12 children rendered speechless by cerebral palsy and other disorders .
Over the next two decades , it gained some adherents in patient and medical communities , but failed to produce consistent results in controlled , scientific settings .
Researchers said that facilitators were unconsciously or consciously guiding patients ' hands .
Multiple professional organizations , including the American Association on Intellectual and Developmental Disabilities and the American Academy of Pediatrics , say that facilitated communication is not credible .
Far more credible , however , is emerging research on patients thought to be in vegetative states , but revealed by brain - scanning technology to be at least minimally conscious , and even aware of what is happening around them .
These two strains of research have collided in the figure of Houben .
In 2006 , a full 23 years after a horrific car accident left him paralyzed and apparently unconscious , tests run by the University of Liege 's Coma Science Group showed that Houben 's brain was active , and almost normal .
He was n't a vegetable , but aware , and trapped silently in the prison of his ruined body .
Houben has since proven able to answer yes - or - no questions with slight movements of his foot .
It 's a tremendous accomplishment , and raises the chilling possibility that , as estimated by Coma Science Group leader Steven Laureys in a Monday New York Times story , as many as four in 10 people considered utterly comatose may be misdiagnosed .
But the legitimacy of interviews given by Houben and his facilitator to Der Spiegel , and shown on video by the BBC , may not be as certain .
" I believe that he is sentient .
They 've shown that with MRI scans , " said James Randi , a prominent skeptic who during the 1990s investigated the use of facilitated communication for autistic children .
But in the video , " You see this woman who 's not only holding his hand , but what she 's doing is directing his fingers and looking directly at the keyboard .
She 's pressing down on the keyboard , pressing messages for him .
He has nothing to do with it . "
According to Randi , facilitated communication could only be considered credible if the facilitator did n't look at the keyboard or screen while supporting Houben 's hand , and helped him type messages in response to questions she had not heard , thus ensuring that Houben 's responses are entirely his own .
The James Randi Educational Foundation has offered a million - dollar prize to a valid demonstration of facilitated communication , and Randi invited Houben to participate .
" Our prize is still there , " he said .
In the Der Spiegel interview , Houben and his facilitator recounted his ordeal .
" I would scream , but no sound would come out , " they wrote .
" I became the witness to my own suffering , as doctors and nurses tried to speak to me and eventually gave up . "
Of the correct diagnosis , they wrote , " I will never forget the day they finally discovered what was wrong — it was my second birth . "
According to Caplan , Houben 's apparent lucidity after spending more than two decades in complete isolation — circumstances known to be psychologically and cognitively damaging — is hard to believe .
" You 're going to lie for 23 years in a hospital bed with almost no stimuli , and then sound completely coherent and cogent ? " he said .
" Something is wrong with that picture .
The messages are almost poetic .
It sounds too lucid , like someone prepared these things to say .
I 'm not saying it 's all a fraud , but I want to hear a lot more . "
Whatever the final verdict on Houben 's facilitated communication , however , it does not alter the fact of his misdiagnosis .
Laureys could not be reached for comment , but said in an Agence France Presse story that " every patient should be tested at least 10 times before they are categorically defined as ' vegetative . ' "

TWO gay men from Bangladesh who offered to have sex before Australian immigration officials to prove their sexuality will appeal their case for protection visas for the fourth time in 10 years .
The men , who cannot be named , told The Daily Telegraph they feared being killed if their latest bid for refugee status is refused at a hearing later this month .
A Federal Court judge recently criticised the Refugee Review Tribunal for its treatment of the pair , who first applied for asylum in 1999 , finding it was deliberately biased against them .
In a scathing summation , Justice Spender found three previous tribunals had unreasonably twisted facts to deny the men were homosexual , using unsubstantiated claims they were brothers who had been married to women .
While a first tribunal found they were homosexual , it refused them entry on the grounds they could avoid persecution in Bangladesh if they " lived discreetly " .
The High Court later upheld their appeal stating the gay men faced a " real risk " of harm if they were deported and could not reasonably be expected to live in hiding .
A subsequent tribunal then used an anonymous phone call to contest the men were brothers , a claim later disproved by DNA testing .
Increasingly frustrated by the process , the couple said in a submission : " We are prepared to have an adult witness view us engaged in an act of homosexual intercourse and then attest before you to that fact . "
In a 2007 hearing , the tribunal asked one of the two men " if he and the second applicant have sex in the morning " and " if they used a lubricant . "
The 36 - year - old said he had been " too embarrassed to answer the personal questions " , with his refusal later used as proof he was a not a credible witness .
Human rights lawyer Bruce Levet , who represents the men , described the tribunal 's conduct as " disgraceful " adding : " I was ashamed to be a lawyer . "
Because the men had lived monogamously for 14 years and did not frequent gay bars or take an active part in the gay community , Mr Levet said they had struggled to convince the hearings of their sexuality claims .
He said the Commonwealth had resisted granting the asylum test case for fear of a pink wave of refugees from countries opposed to homosexuality .
The pair , who live in southwest Sydney , fled Bangladesh in 1999 after they say they were stoned , kicked and punched during a violent attack .
The Tribunal will announce a new appeal date on October 18 .

Chris Peck , policy coordinator for the CTC , wonders why train companies appear to be uninterested in cyclists ' custom
Why is it so difficult to take a bike on a train ?
Taking your bike by train in the UK needs a combination of luck , patience and an encyclopaedic knowledge of the rail industry .
Why is it so hard to take a bike on a train when the usual alternative would be driving all the way ?
I went away for the weekend recently , starting with a train from Guildford to Reading .
The trains on this line sometimes have space for one bike , sometimes nothing .
I had to guess where the bike space would be and then pray that it was n't already be stuffed with luggage .
Then I had to contend with the volumes of other people , many of whom had bikes , bags , pushchairs and the like as they flooded on and off three tiny coaches in a hurry .
Most of the bikes were stashed in the vestibule , ready to fall out of the train if the doors opened .
Irritatingly , the privatised rail system and a lack of interest from the government means that each company has approached the issue of carrying bikes in a different way .
Almost without exception , full - size bikes are n't allowed onto trains entering London at peak hours .
Similar rules exist for other cities , but those hours – and the level of enforcement – vary wildly .
There is no standard sign to advertise on trains and platforms where bikes can be carried .
You can't reserve the single cycle space on the Guildford to Reading train – but if you change on to a long - distance train you must possess a reservation .
Other train companies have different demands on where and when reservations are required and how to obtain them .
Sadly the only company that allows you to book cycle reservations online with your ticket was National Express , which does n't look like it will exist for much longer .
Good cycle parking – which the government is putting £ 14 m into over the next two years – can reduce the soaring bike theft at stations ( double the level of five years ago , while car crime at stations has halved ) and will no doubt encourage more people to ride to stations .
But better parking only helps if you do n't want to use your bike at the other end of the journey , or it 's your regular commute .
If you 're using the train on a day trip or to go on holiday , you 'll most probably want to take your bike with you .
Leisure cyclists can bring vital custom to otherwise quiet off - peak trains – I 've heard of early - morning weekend trains where cyclists made up over half of the passengers .
Even worse , the government is proposing that the longer - distance high - speed trains to replace much of the existing fleet will have even fewer spaces for bikes – with space for just four bikes on trains for 650 people .
At the moment there is space for just six bikes on the equivalent trains and even that is woefully inadequate .
CTC is campaigning against this move – as we have with most other attempts by train companies to deny cyclists ' custom .
Sixty per cent of people live within 15 minutes of a railway station , but less than 2 % of train trips start with a bike ride to the station .
If it was a bit easier to take your bike on the station , surely a few more people might give the trains another go ?

Here are some images Bill Hopen , my sculptor friend sent me regarding a real estate crash in China .
Yes ,
It 's a 12 story building lying flat on the ground .
(1) An underground garage was being dug on the south side , to a depth of 4.6 meters .
(2) The excavated dirt was being piled up on the north side , to a height of 10 meters .
(3) The building experienced uneven lateral pressure from south and north .
(4) This resulted in a lateral pressure of 3,000 tons , which was greater than what the pilings could tolerate .
Thus the building toppled over in the southerly direction .
If the buildings were closer together there would also have been a domino effect .
Note the hollow concrete piers .
Synopsis of Event
Bill Hopen writes :
Mish , this photographic image is so metaphorical , it could only have been more symbolic if a domino effect had occurred .
I think of the financial collapse of the families that own these condos and the impact to the bank underpinning the construction loans , then I think of the whole city collapsing without the buildings physically falling over .
All my young in - laws are rushing in to buy condos putting life savings down as well as laying down additional borrowed family cash down and then paying way more to buy each month than it would cost them to rent .
It 's as if the boom crash in the west never happened and they believe themselves immune .

Obama 's cabinet has the lowest percentage on record .

Naughty
Dog may have claimed to have already maxed out the PlayStation 3 , but Resistance and Ratchet and Clank developer Insomniac has stated that they believe that the console will remain untapped for a few more years .
Much like EA ’s comments regarding the machine , Insomniac is confident that the PlayStation will last the test of time and only improve in quality .
Insomniac ’s senior community manager , James Stevenson , has said it could take another two to three years before developers truly start to max out the PS3 :
“ There ’s always ways we can become more efficient .
The PlayStation platforms are built with a very high ceiling and I think that ’s part of the success Sony has had in creating these platforms with really long life spans , ” The first couple of years are all about developers getting games up and working .
You see what Naughty Dog has had the chance to do in the past two years .
You ’ve seen what we ’ve been able to do in that time .
This is where it gets exciting .
The PS3 still feels like a young system and I feel like it ’s finally hitting its prime .
You ’ve got the Slim , it ’s at a good price point now and sales are really picking up .
I still think you ’re not going to see the PS3 really maxed out for another two to three years .
We ’re using all of the PS3 right now , but you can always be more efficient in the way you use it . ”
Insomniac ’s latest game , Ratchet and Clank Future : A Crack in Time , is due out on November 6 .

Brandon Henry is seen testifying in the trial of Robert Lawlor .
( November 17 , 2009 )
HARTFORD — - Fifteen - year - old Adrian
Mestre was on his way to buy potato chips at Olga 's Market on May 7 , 2005 when he saw that something was about to happen .
Two white men walked swiftly toward a vehicle in a nearby parking lot at Main and Nelson streets and yelled , " Put your hands up . "
Minutes later , three or four " rapid " gunshots rang out , Mestre testified Monday in Superior Court in Hartford .
The car then sped away .
Mestre , now 20 , was the first witness to testify Monday in the trial of Robert Lawlor , a Hartford police detective accused of fatally shooting 18 - year - old Jashon Bryant and wounding another person while working with federal authorities on an anti-gun task force in May 2005 .
Lawlor , 45 , who served 18 years with the Hartford police force , faces charges of manslaughter and assault in connection with the shooting of Bryant .
Lawlor says he saw Bryant reaching for a gun while in the passenger seat of a car , but no gun was found .
Mestre said the two men he saw that day were dressed in regular clothes but he knew they were lawmen because they were white and because of the way they were dressed .
"
You do n't see people like that in the neighborhood , " Mestre said .
Mestre , who is currently being held at the Hartford Correctional Center on a felony charge of possession of narcotics , had a difficult time on the witness stand Monday answering some questions from both the prosecutor and Lawlor 's defense attorney .
He was shown statements he made to police after the shooting and testimony he gave to a grand jury in an effort to help him with recall the incident .
Early in his testimony , Mestre said he could not remember whether the shooting occurred during the day or night .
Court records show the incident happened at about 7:30 p.m.
" It was four years ago , " Mestre told the prosecutor , New Haven State 's Attorney Michael Dearington .
" It could have been getting dark , I do n't remember .
" Lawlor was working with an agent from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives when he said he saw Bryant holding a gun as Bryant got into a friend 's car , authorities said .
The officers approached the car , and when the vehicle began moving , Lawlor fired his weapon , according to court records .
Lawlor told police that he feared the federal agent was about to get hit by the car and that he believed Bryant was reaching for a gun .
Police did not find a weapon in the car .
Bryant died instantly while his companion , Brandon Henry , who was shot in the chest , crashed the car into a parked car several blocks away .
A one - person investigatory grand jury recommended that Lawlor face charges , and he was arrested in June 2006 .
Testimony resumes this afternoon .

— - Brandon
Henry did n't want the two policemen who had stopped the Nissan Maxima he was driving to find the crack cocaine he had in the car .
He did n't want to go to jail and , with one of the officers pointing a gun a the car , he was scared , Henry , 26 , testified in Superior Court today .
So when the cop with the gun turned away , Henry turned the Maxima on and started to drive , prompting the officer to open fire .
" I see a chance to flee , so I fled , " said Henry .
The officer is Robert Lawlor , a Hartford police detective now on trial for manslaughter and assault charges .
He is accused of injuring Henry and killing his friend , 18 - year - old Jashon Bryant , in the 2005 shooting .
Lawlor was working with a federal agent on a gun task force .
They approached the Maxima , which had been parked in the rear lot of a store on Main Street , because Lawlor said he saw the passenger holding a gun .
Henry testified that as he heard the gunshots , he felt his body hit the steering wheel .
When the car made it to Main Street , Henry looked at Bryant .
" I seen him just sitting in the back seat .
I was shaking him , calling his name .
He was sitting back in the seat , not responding , " Henry said .
Bryant had blood on his head , and Henry said he knew the injury was serious .
From Main Street he turned onto Westland .
When he got to Clark Street , he saw police lights behind me .
" That 's when I mashed on the gas , " he said .
Henry said he saw a car in front of him stopped at a stop sign .
As the Nissan Maxima got close to the car , Henry put his weight on Bryant so he would n't go through the windshield when they crashed .
Henry is expected to continue testifying this afternoon .

Henry testified Tuesday that he was afraid the two plainclothes police officers who stopped him in his girlfriend 's car on May 7 , 2005 , would find the crack cocaine he had stashed in the driver 's side door .
Henry was on probation for a previous drug conviction and had 3 ½ years hanging over his head if he got arrested again .
Scared of going to prison , he started the engine and began to drive away when one of the officers , the one pointing a gun at the car , turned around to talk on his cellphone .
The officer , a Hartford police detective named Robert Lawlor , opened fire as soon as the car moved .
A bullet went through Henry 's pectoral muscle .
His passenger and friend , 18 - year - old Jashon Bryant , was shot in the head and killed .
Henry , 26 , testified Tuesday in Superior Court , where Lawlor is on trial on first - degree manslaughter and first - degree assault charges .
The charges carry a maximum punishment of 40 years in prison if Lawlor , 45 , is convicted .
Lawlor was working that night with an agent from the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol , Tobacco , Firearms and Explosives .
He said he saw Bryant holding a gun as he got into the car , a Nissan Maxima that had been parked in the rear lot of a store on Main Street .
A weapon was never found and an investigatory grand jury recommended that charges be brought against Lawlor , a member of the Hartford force for 18 years .
Henry denied having a weapon during Tuesday 's testimony .
There was no gun in the car and Bryant did not have a gun , he said .
" No gun , period , " he said , during direct examination by New Haven State 's Attorney Michael Dearington .
Henry said he was in the store on Main Street buying a pack of cigarettes while Byrant parked the car in the rear lot to look for $ 5 he had lost .
When Henry left the store , he noticed two men , one wearing a hoodie and the other in a skull cap , staring at him from across the street .
They approached the Maxima as Henry and Bryant got in .
As he backed up and prepared to drive out of the lot , Henry said , he saw the guy in the hoodie draw a weapon and order them to put their hands up .
" Only cops say things like that , " Henry said .
Both driver and passenger complied with the officers ' orders .
But then Henry saw a chance to escape and took it .
As he fled and heard the gunshots , he felt his body hit the steering wheel .
When the car made it to Main Street , Henry looked at Bryant .
" I seen him just sitting back in the seat .
I was shaking him , calling his name .
He was sitting back in the seat , not responding , " Henry said .
Bryant had blood on his head , and Henry said he knew the injury was serious .
The Maxima crashed into a vehicle that had stopped at a stop sign near Clark and Nelson streets .
Henry fled .
He ran past a building where he once lived , jumped a couple of fences , crossed a yard and crawled under the porch of a home on Elmer Street where police found him .
Dearington asked if he had entered either of the two apartment buildings or had thrown anything into them .
" I did n't have anything to throw , " Henry said .
Lawlor 's attorney , Michael A. Georgetti , asked Henry whether drug dealers carry guns .
Henry admitted that he sold crack cocaine for a living around the time of the shooting .
He drove around the North End of Hartford on May 7 , 2005 , trying to " catch sales , " but denied having a gun .
" I was n't making that kind of money to carry a gun , " he said .
Georgetti asked if selling drugs was dangerous .
" Not that I recall , " Henry replied .
Georgetti also asked Henry about his narcotics conviction in 2004 , a felony conviction in 2007 and gun charges currently pending in Hartford .
Hartford police stopped Henry in September for riding a bike without illumination de- vices and found he had a black Sentinel . 22 - caliber revolver and marijuana on him , police said .
Charges against Henry in - cluded carrying a pistol without a permit , criminal possession of a firearm and failing to have lights illuminated .

( Natural News )
Three doctors and six nurses from the town of Grudziadz , Poland , are being investigated on charges that they recruited 350 homeless people into a clinical trial of a vaccine for the H5N1 flu virus without informing them what the study was really about .
Twenty - one people died during the course of the study , significantly higher than the average influenza death rate , which would have led to eight deaths .
" It is in the interests of all doctors that those who are responsible for this are punished , " said Poland 's health minister , Ewa Kopacz .
She said that while no direct link has been proven between the experimental vaccine and the deaths , she does not believe that any of the health care workers implicated should be allowed to practice medicine further .
Prosecutors claim that the participants - from a homeless shelter - were recruited into the study by being offered £ 1 - £ 2 ( $ 1.65 - $ 3.00 ) to undergo a test of a new vaccine for standard , seasonal influenza .
Instead , however , the study was meant to test a vaccine of the far more lethal H5N1 virus , which has a death rate of more than 50 percent .
Novartis Vaccines , the pharmaceutical company involved in the trial , claims that it was deceived about the consent procedures that the researchers intended to use .
The scandal is only the latest to hit Poland 's health care sector .
In 2002 , several ambulance medics were convicted of murdering patients in order to gain kickbacks from funeral homes .
Poland is a global center for health care research , due to a well - trained medical staff , large population and good infrastructure .
It also tends to be easy to find patients willing to undergo experimental therapies , as the public health care system tends to pay only for the cheapest , most well - proven generic treatments .
Monika Stefanczyk , a senior pharmaceutical market analyst at the consulting firm PMR , predicted that unless some of these factors change , Poland 's medical research industry will remain largely unaffected by the scandal .

MAISONCELLE , France —
The heavy clay - laced mud behind the cattle pen on Antoine Renault ’s farm looks as treacherous as it must have been nearly 600 years ago , when King Henry V rode from a spot near here to lead a sodden and exhausted English Army against a French force that was said to outnumber his by as much as five to one .
No one can ever take away the shocking victory by Henry and his “ band of brothers , ” as Shakespeare would famously call them , on St. Crispin ’s Day , Oct. 25 , 1415 .
They devastated a force of heavily armored French nobles who had gotten bogged down in the region ’s sucking mud , riddled by thousands of arrows from English longbowmen and outmaneuvered by common soldiers with much lighter gear .
It would become known as the Battle of Agincourt .
But Agincourt ’s status as perhaps the greatest victory against overwhelming odds in military history — and a keystone of the English self - image — has been called into doubt by a group of historians in Britain and France who have painstakingly combed an array of military and tax records from that time and now take a skeptical view of the figures handed down by medieval chroniclers .
The historians have concluded that the English could not have been outnumbered by more than about two to one .
And depending on how the math is carried out , Henry may well have faced something closer to an even fight , said Anne Curry , a professor at the University of Southampton who is leading the study .
a superb writer , with a startling command of the historian 's art .
A new book from nationally recognized author Thomas A. Lewis offers a fresh and startling perspective on the problems afflicting modern industrial society , and on the increasingly urgent need for sustainable living .
In Brace for Impact : Surviving the Crash of the Industrial Age by Sustainable Living , Lewis argues that industry 's relentless , decades - long search for economies of scale has caused equally enormous concentrations of risks , which now threaten the continued existence of every industrial - scale enterprise supplying essential human needs .
Brace for Impact begins with chapters on the mounting failures of industrial agriculture .
" Losing Ground " chronicles the destruction wrought by the way agribusiness grows crops , and " Fat of the Land " the horrors -- and dangers -- of the way it raises animals .
With subsequent chapters on water ( dwindling supplies and worsening pollution ) , imminent oil shortages ( peak oil , in fact , may already have arrived ) and rampant problems in the electrical grid ( for which the solution is not a " smart " grid , but no grid at all ) , the book offers an exhaustive catalog of the rising threats to our supplies of food , water and energy .
Then , after examining the political and financial institutions that refuse to recognize the dangers , let alone move to counter them , Brace for Impact faces the inevitable conclusion : industrial society is about to crash , and can not be saved .
But Lewis argues that while it is not possible to save everyone from the crash , it is entirely possible , indeed relatively simple , for any individual , family or community that embraces sustainable living to avoid the worst consequences .
In a final chapter , " Sanctuary , " Lewis points the way toward security and prosperity in the ruins of an age destroyed by greed .
Lewis is a veteran journalist ( for six years he wrote the " EQ Index , " an annual survey of the environment of the United States , for National Wildlife Magazine and the World Almanac ) , author ( The Shenandoah in Flames , The Guns of Cedar Creek , The Wildlife of North America , For King and Country , West from Shenandoah ) and editor ( he was the Series Editor of " Planet Earth , " a 16 - book series on the earth sciences from Time - Life Books , and is a former editor and publisher of Civil War Magazine ) .
He lives on his own sanctuary - in - progress , a 20 - acre farm in West Virginia , and is artist in residence at the Department of Mass Communication at Frostburg State University in Maryland .
He maintains a blog relating the principles of the book to the news of the day at http://www.thomasalewis.com.
Lewis 's writing has won praise across the country .
The New York Times called his Guns of Cedar Creek " rich in political and military significance for our times . "
The Los Angeles Times , reviewing For King and Country , called him " a superb writer , with a startling command of the historian 's art . "
The New Republic Magazine described his work as " realistic and tough - minded , " adding : " his pace is fast and energetic , his tone detached and ironic without being cynical . "
Brace for Impact , published by Outskirts Press of Denver , Colorado , is available through bookstores nationwide , on Amazon.com and Barnes and Noble.com .

Unemployment continues to tick upward .
Small businesses forgo profits on two - for - one deals just to keep the doors open .
But we 're in recovery .
Treasury Secretary Timothy Geithner , the guy who could n't get around to paying his own taxes , says so .
After all , government is doing all it can to speed the recovery , is n't it ?
" Fed keeps key rate near zero , " the business - page headline screamed on September 24 .
Low interest rates should get things " stimulated , " should n't they ?
Then , three days later , over a Washington dateline , " Jobless benefits extension backed : Lawmakers voted 331- 83 to extend jobless benefits by 13 weeks in 27 states , including Nevada , where the unemployment rate is above 8.5 percent . "
That should help , right ?
For the answers , let us turn to Murray Rothbard 's classic account of the economic mistakes made in Washington from 1929 through 1938 , America 's Great Depression .
When economies get into trouble , Mr. Rothbard points out , businessmen are " misled by bank credit inflation to invest too much in higher - order capital goods " such as houses and cars .
The " boom , " then , " is actually a period of wasteful misinvestment … .
Errors are made due to bank credit 's tampering with the free market . "
This is followed by a recovery period that sees a " rapid liquidation of the wasteful investments , " and , typically , a deflationary credit contraction , which helps restore confidence in the remaining sound banks .
In short , and this is a highly important point to grasp , the depression is the recovery process … .
The depression , then , far from being an evil scourge , is the necessary and beneficial return of the economy to normal after the distortions by the boom .
The boom , then requires a bust … .
" If government wishes to see a depression ended as quickly as possible , and the economy returned to normal prosperity , " professor Rothbard explains , " the first and clearest injunction is : do n't interfere with the market 's adjustment process , " which will include bankruptcies of unsound enterprises , credit contraction , and falling wages and prices .
This is the course the government took during the 1920 – 21 recession , which was over so quickly that the history books barely remember it .
( Except in the farm segment of the economy , where the government made the mistake of interfering to try to hold crop prices at artificially inflated World War I levels — a mistake that has now been ongoing for 90 years . )
But let us say , for the sake of argument , that government wanted to hamper the normal process of economic adjustment , which helps make recessions brief and relatively painless .
If anyone in Washington were to be so wacky as to seek to extend the pain of a recession , what course would they follow ?
On page 26 of America 's Great Depression , Rothbard presents that very catalog of idiocy :
Here are the ways the adjustment process can be hobbled : Prevent or delay liquidation .
Lend money to shaky businesses , call on banks to lend further , etc. Inflate further .
Further inflation blocks the necessary fall in prices , thus delaying adjustment and prolonging depression .
Further credit expansion creates more malinvestments , which , in their turn , will have to be liquidated in some later depression .
A government ' easy money ' policy prevents the market 's return to the necessary higher interest rates .
Keep wage rates up .
Artificial maintenance of wage rates in a depression ensures permanent mass unemployment .
Furthermore , in a deflation , when prices are falling , keeping the same rate of money wages means that real wage rates have been pushed higher .
In the face of falling business demand , this greatly aggravates the unemployment problem .
In addition to " minimum wage laws , " do n't we now have " living wage " ordinances , " project labor agreements , " and , for our unionized government employees , " automatic step and seniority raises " in addition to cost - of - living adjustments that boost the pay of government employees as well as welfare recipients — even when the cost of living is falling ?
Rothbard continues , cataloguing precisely the wrong things to do if you want a recession to end :
Keep prices up .
Keeping prices above their free - market levels will create unsalable surpluses , and prevent a return to prosperity .
Stimulate consumption and discourage saving .
We have seen that more saving and less consumption would speed recovery ; more consumption and less saving aggravate the shortage of saved - capital even further .
Government can encourage consumption by " food stamp plans " and relief payments .
Note that America 's Great Depression was published in 1963 .
How 's Rothbard doing at predicting Obamanomics , so far ?
About the only thing he seems to have missed are " Cash for Clunkers " and the fledgling " green jobs " boondoggle .
Government " can discourage savings and investment by higher taxes , " Rothbard continues ,
particularly on the wealthy and on corporations and estates .
As a matter of fact , any increase of taxes and government spending will discourage saving and investment and stimulate consumption , since government spending is all consumption … .
Subsidize unemployment :
Any subsidization of unemployment ( via unemployment ' insurance , ' relief , etc. ) will prolong unemployment indefinitely , and delay the shift of workers to the fields where jobs are available . "
Incredible .
We know what these measures do .
They delay economic adjustment and recovery ; they extend economic hardship , regardless of whether we call the hard times a depression or a " great recession . "
This was all proved , laboriously , in spades , from 1929 to 1938 , all brilliantly analyzed and explained by the late Murray N. Rothbard , with whom I had the honor to discuss some of government 's tendencies to repeat the same mind - boggling errors over and over again , during his time at the University of Nevada , Las Vegas .
The only question remaining : Since the experiment has already been done , and the long - term effects of these policies demonstrated — to the enormous pain and inconvenience of our long - suffering grandparents — why do the boys in Washington now insist on repeating this experiment in economic disaster , all over again ?

Iranians in London protest imprisonment of Christian converts
September 14 , 2009
Iranian protestors in London have drawn renewed attention to the plight of two young women who were imprision in the notorious Evin prision after their conversion to Christianity .
Julia Duin of The Washington Times recounted this remarkable exchange from their recent trial :
“ You were Muslims and now you have become Christians ? ” the prosecutor asked them .
“ We were born in Muslim families , but we were not Muslims , ” was the women 's reply .
When he asked them whether they regretted becoming Christians , “ We have no regrets , ” the women replied .
When he told them to renounce their beliefs , “ We will not deny our faith , ” they said .
At one point , they got into a theological debate while trying to explain how the Holy Spirit speaks to them .
“ It is impossible for God to speak with humans , ” the prosecutor said .
“ Are you questioning whether God is almighty ? ” Marzieh asked .
“ You are not worthy for God to speak to you , ” the prosecutor said .
“ It is God , and not you , who determines if I am worthy , ” Marzieh replied .
When they were told to return to prison and think over their options , “ We have already done our thinking , ” the women said .

With the introduction in the past ten to fifteen years of durable finishes that are easy to repair , hardwood floors can last for decades .
Throughout the centuries , hardwood flooring has been a durable , design friendly and long lasting flooring of choice for the consumers .
Coziness and Warmth of Hardwood Flooring
In comparison to laminate , customers will often reflect on hardwood flooring being more pleasant and warm to walk on which comes from the natural make up of wood .
Wood floors are an excellent insulator , thanks to its thousands of tiny air chambers per cubic inch , which hold in heat .
Hypoallergenic
Got allergies ?
Hardwood floors do not provide any place for pollen , animal dander , mold , etc. to hide and thrive .
Hardwood flooring is an excellent choice for anyone with any kind of environmental allergies .
Hardwood Flooring Types & Wood Specimens
Hardwood Flooring
Hardwood Flooring is just that – a solid piece of wood from inside out .
Solid hardwood flooring comes from milled solid lumber and is available in unfinished or pre-finished forms .
Unfinished solid wood floors need to be sanded on - site and finished after installation .
Pre -finished solid wood floors are installation ready and do not require additional preparation .
Engineered Hardwood Flooring
Engineered hardwood flooring is manufactured with a real wood surface and several layers of different laminate or wood veneers .
Unlike Hardwood Flooring , engineered flooring is moisture - resistant and suitable for basements .
Both solid and engineered hardwood flooring are durable and long - lasting but engineered flooring is exceptionally strong thanks to its laminated layers .
Australian man faces lengthy jail term for “ offensive ” letters
By Mike Head
30 October 2009
In the first case of its kind in Australia , a Muslim man faces up to 14 years in prison for sending allegedly offensive letters to the families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan .
Sheikh Haron was arrested and charged last week with using the postal system to “ menace , harass or cause offense ” .
As the Iranian - born Haron , 45 , was arrested , the Sydney Joint Counter Terrorism Team searched his home and two others across Sydney .
The involvement of the anti-terrorist squad in the federal - state police operation appeared to be calculated to associate Haron with terrorism .
That was certainly the implication in the media beat - ups covering the case .
Haron did not enter a plea when he appeared in a Sydney court on seven counts under section 471.12 of the federal Criminal Code .
Each charge carries a potential maximum sentence of two years in prison .
He was released on bail and told to report back on November 10 .
Section 471.12 is extremely vague .
It makes it an offence to use a “ postal or similar service ” in a way “ ( whether by the method of use or the content of a communication , or both ) that reasonable persons would regard as being , in all the circumstances , menacing , harassing or offensive ” .
Haron allegedly wrote the letters over a two - year period , raising questions about the timing of his arrest .
It came amid growing public opposition to the eight - year - long US - led occupation of Afghanistan .
Australia has lost 11 soldiers in Afghanistan since joining the 2001 invasion .
In April this year , Prime Minister Kevin Rudd ’s government nevertheless announced a significant expansion of its military commitment , boosting the number of Australian troops from 1,100 to 1,550 , in line with the Obama administration ’s escalation of the war .
A line from one of Haron ’s letters to a family allegedly stated : “ I feel bad that you have lost your son but I do n’t feel bad that a murderer of innocent civilians has lost his life . ”
According to a Murdoch tabloid , the Sydney Daily Telegraph , the letters accused the dead soldiers of being “ criminals ” and “ killers ” fighting a war of invasion .
The Australian reported that one letter had an anti-Semitic tone .
“ A Jewish man who kills innocent Muslim civilians is not a pig , he is a thousand times worse , ” it said .
The letter was sent to the Jewish family of 30 - year - old Private Greg Sher , who was killed by a Taliban rocket in January .
Other reports indicated that the push for prosecution did not come from Sher ’s family , however .
His father , Felix Sher , said the family was shocked by the letter , but told the Fairfax Radio Network : “ There is no point in getting angry or upset , nothing is going to be achieved by it . ”
While the letters , if reported accurately , are extremely distasteful , and falsely seek to blame individual soldiers for Australia ’s involvement in the US - led war in Afghanistan , their contents are statements of ideological and political opinion .
Like the war in Iraq , the occupation of Afghanistan has produced widespread killings of civilians by US - led forces , whether by aerial bombings , ground assaults or policing operations .
There have been a number of incidents in which Australian troops have been involved in the killing of civilians .
Although the Australian Federal Police laid the charges against Haron , it is unlikely that his arrest would have been authorised without consultation with the Labor government .
This is the first recorded use of little - noticed laws that were introduced in 2002 alongside the initial barrage of “ anti- terrorism ” legislation brought forward after the 9/11 attacks in the US .
With Labor ’s backing , the Howard government replaced an earlier section in the Crimes Act .
It removed the previous requirement that the person to whom a letter was sent had to be actually menaced , harassed or offended .
The change imposed the broader “ reasonable persons ” test instead and doubled the maximum prison term from one year to two .
In 2004 , a similar adjustment was made to the telecommunications legislation .
The amendments make it much easier to charge and convict .
In other legal contexts , the term “ offensive ” is notoriously vague and has long been used by governments , police and courts to punish views or language deemed to be unacceptable .
But the “ reasonable person ” test makes the wording even more open to political exploitation .
If Haron is convicted , it will be a precedent that could be employed against any opponent of the neo-colonial wars in Afghanistan and Iraq who sends letters , leaflets or newspapers through the mail , or posts material on - line .
Despite the obvious prejudicial impact on Haron ’s chances of a fair trial , the media immediately sought to whip up public hostility , declaring that the allegations against him had “ sparked community outrage ” .
A Daily Telegraph editorial claimed that although Australia was a “ free country , ” there were “ some views so extreme they unite Australians in opposition ” .
Prime Minister Rudd quickly weighed in , asserting that when people read the story on the front page of the Daily Telegraph , “ I think their stomachs turned ” .
Likewise , New South Wales Premier Nathan Rees said posting anti-war mail to families of Australian soldiers killed in Afghanistan was an “ evil act of cowardice ” .
In a further threat to free speech , Defence Personnel Minister Greg Combet said it would be best if Haron ’s website were shut down while court proceedings were still pending .
It appears that the site was then removed .
Those who tried to log on were greeted with the words , “ This account has been suspended . ”
An article on a News Limited web site went one step further .
Haron ’s case , it declared , was “ certain to raise debate over whether migrants guilty of hate crimes against the nation should be deported , even if they have citizenship ” .
Rudd indicated in - principle agreement , saying : “ It is important to reflect upon the strength of our laws generally in dealing with cases in the future where some of the assumptions underpinning immigration conditions have not been honoured . ”
Currently , permanent residency and other visas can be cancelled , as the Howard government did in 2007 when it falsely accused Muhamed Haneef , an Indian - born Islamic doctor , of terrorism .
Citizenship can only be revoked , however , if it was obtained through fraud or a serious crime was committed , and not acknowledged , before it was granted .
The offensive conduct modifications in the postal and telecommunications legislation are another aspect of the police - state measures introduced since 2002 , under the pretext of combating terrorism .
Just like the Howard government before it , the Rudd government is establishing sweeping precedents that can be used to suppress political dissent as social discontent and anti-war sentiment grow .
Daniel Carlat , MD , is Associate Clinical Professor of Psychiatry Tufts University School of Medicine Publisher and Editor The Carlat Psychiatry Report Co-chair , CME Committee Massachusetts Psychiatric Society .
Above all , he is an independent psychiatrist whose informative blog contains fascinating information about powerful , financially compromised groups such as the APA Task Force that is currently engaged in further expanding psychiatry ’s diagnostic / practice guide , the DSM - V .
Their perspective–given their financial stake–is in sync with Pharma ’s market expansion agenda .
ACRE is Pharma ’s latest , powerful , mostly Harvard - based front group : it is spearheaded by Harvard professor , Thomas Stossel , MD. ACRE ’s mission is to persuade physicians that MORE rather than less industry involvement in Continuing Medical Education programs is good for patients –much as industry ’s “ Harry and Louise ” ads were aimed at convincing the public that universal healthcare was BAD for them .
Both attempt to confuse .
ACRE poses as the Association of Clinical Researchers and Educators .
ACRE held its charter conference earlier this month at Harvard Medical School.l
Its steering committee consists of physicians from Harvard Medical School , the State University of New York Downstate and the Mayo Clinic .
Dr. Jeffrey Flier , Dean of the Harvard Medical School , introduced this high powered Pharma - physician conference , which was managed by Rockpointe , a science - based medical communications company that produces “ educational programs ” for doctors most often sponsored by pharmaceutical companies .
Below we post the financial ties uncovered by Dr. Carlat : the ties that bind ACRE steering committee to Big Pharma–ties that were undisclosed on the ACRE website .
Of course , it would be most instructive to learn the secret dollar amount that Harvard Medical School–and its affiliated hospitals–rake in from these unabashed marketing promos masquerading as CME courses !
Dr. Carlat dubbed the organization , “ Academics Craving Reimbursement for Everything . ”
PharmaGossip renamed ACRE : Forum for University Corporate Kickbacks in Education as Determined by University Professors :
Why is ACRE very ripe for satire ?
As Dr. Carlat explains , because “ it consists of rich doctors complaining that they want more money from drug companies , and such an organization lacks any inherent credibility , and seems , frankly , absurd . ”
Dr. Carlat noted that “ In all the hoopla and excitement of forming a new organization such as ACRE , certain minor details are easy to overlook .
One of these details is a listing of financial disclosures , which is conspicuously missing from the ACRE website . ”
Below are two of Dr. Carlat ’s ACRE posts–one about the undisclosed financial ties of the speakers and the post describing the flavor of the ACRE conference :
“ Oh boy , ” I thought , pen poised , “ finally , some data on the effects of transparency laws on patient outcomes . ”
But alas , Dr. Gonzalez - Campoy ’s evidence base amounted to a single patient , a 73 year old man with severe diabetes .
“ Do you know what drug he was on ? ” He asked incredulously .
“ The cheapest drug money will buy — Glyburide … .
When I asked my patient why he was on that drug , I was appalled by his answer .
He told me that his PCP said it is the most cost - effective drug . ”
It got worse : the patient had apparently been reading newspaper articles saying bad things about the newer diabetes drugs , like Avandia .
The kicker was when he told Dr. Gonzalez - Campoy that “ I ’ve read that doctors are getting brain - washed by drug companies to prescribe these drugs . ”
Do n’t you see what the Minnesota disclosure law has wrought ?
Patients getting prescribed generic medications .
Patients reading the newspaper .
Patients questioning the morals of their physicians .
“ … the eeriest presentation came from one J. Michael Gonzalez - Campoy , an endocrinologist who was flown out on the ACRE - jet from Minnesota .
His job was to convince everybody that Minnesota ’s 1993 physician payment disclosure law ( the first in the nation ) was an awful mistake .
His tactic , theoretically , was a good one .
“ The law has been terrible for patients , ” he declared , speaking in the ominous tones of a doctor notifying you of grim laboratory results .
The ACRE conference , it would appear was “ full of sound and fury signifying nothing . ”

ACRE Meeting : Welcome to Anger Village
Yesterday , I attended the charter meeting of ACRE ( Association of Clinical Researchers and Educators ) in Boston .
The title of the conference was “ Optimizing Value to Patient Care of Industry - Physician Collaboration , ” and the schedule called for 23 speakers over a 6 hour period , all in a hot amphitheater crowded with pharmaceutical reps , doctors , reporters , and miscellaneous others .
Obviously , I arrived with a skeptic ’s attitude .
After all , I had already parodied the organization with this mock blog renaming ACRE “ Academics Craving Reimbursement for Everything . ”
I was not alone in my difficulty taking the organization seriously .
On the pharma gossip website , there was an even more vicious parody , in which the organization is renamed Forum for University Corporate Kickbacks in Education as Determined by University Professors , yielded a more colorful acronym which you can work out on your own .
Why is ACRE so very ripe for satire ?
Because it consists of rich doctors complaining that they want more money from drug companies , and such an organization lacks any inherent credibility , and seems , frankly , absurd .
On the other hand , I like and respect the “ two Toms ” ( Tom Stossel and Tom Sullivan ) who formed the organization and I realize that there are some purer motives than greed operating here .
That ’s why I attended the meeting .
The whole experience felt very much like an anthropological expedition .
I took Boston ’s Green Line to Harvard ’s Brigham and Women ’s Hospital ( where Dr. Stossel is an esteemed faculty member ) , a building so massive that the main hallway is called the “ Pike . ”
I was directed by the information clerk to walk down the Pike and take “ exit 6 ” to reach the Bornstein Amphitheater .
I arrived 10 minutes late and encountered a small auditorium with steep rows of seats so crowded with pharmaceutical executives and physicians that people were sitting on the steps .
I squeezed into a seat in the middle of a row that had been overlooked by the masses , and began my experience of the cultural village that is ACRE .
For the most part , what unreeled over the next 6 hours was an endless succession of smart , accomplished , and furious men ( actually , there were three women — two of whom were patients ) .
Harvard ’s dean , Jeffrey Flier , introduced the conference , but his comments must have been exceedingly short , because by 10:10 AM , Dr. Stossel was speaking .
As I said , I ’ve always liked Tom Stossel , even though we disagree about the value of industry ’s use of physicians as marketers and educators .
He ’s always entertaining and creative .
He ’s the guy who hatched the evocative term “ pharmascolds ” to describe people like Senator Grassley and me and plenty others , and in this talk he called the current regulatory environment a “ conflict of interest police state . ”
Though some paint Stossel as an extremist , he is not , and in fact made clear at the outset that the goal of ACRE is not to repeal the recent gift ban and disclosure law passed by the Massachusetts legislature .
Rather , he wants ACRE to act as a forum for preventing further restrictions on industry - academic interactions which he feels would be detrimental to medical research and treatment .
His heart is in the right place .
Unfortunately , after Stossel ’s introductory remarks , the program devolved into a collective middle finger pointed at everybody viewed as the “ enemy , ” which included government , elite academics ( yes , even though the conference was held at Harvard ) , bloggers , The New York Times , all medical journals , most lawyers , and then I began to lose count .
A major agenda of the speakers was to expunge the term “ conflict of interest ” from the English language .
Dr. Lance Stell , professor of philosophy , said that since there is no “ canonical ” criteria to distinguish “ undue COI ” from regular COI , it would be better to just get rid of the term altogether .
Other speakers , taking hints from the George W. Bush playbook ( eg. , it ’s “ climate change , ” not “ global warming ” ) , introduced a series of substitutions for conflict of interest , such as “ congruence of interests , ” “ overlapping interests , ” “ confluence of interests , ” or , my favorite , simply “ interests . ”
It may seem simply comical , but something more serious than word - play was happening here .
The defining problem with inappropriate industry influence in medicine , is , indeed conflict of interests .
When doctors are paid by drug companies to give talks , they are accepting two conflicting and competing incentives : first , deliver the carefully crafted marketing message provided by the drug company , or second , tell the entire truth , which may well include bad things about the drug .
Except in rare cases , this ends up not being a convergence , an overlap , or a confluence — it is a conflict .
But industry “ interests ” were celebrated at this meeting .
Culture shock really set in when Dr. Michael Weber , a New York cardiologist with an Australian accent , described his industry ties by saying “ I ’m proud to say that my list of disclosures is longer than anyone else ’s . ”
Everybody laughed .
This was funny .
This was clever .
Subverting the “ politically correct ” value system of pharmascolds was a crowd - pleaser in ACRE Village .
Actually , Weber was wrong .
University of Texas oncologist Avi Markowitz had him beat in the disclosure department .
Markowitz also one - upped his colleagues in the sarcastic fury category .
Sarcasm , anger , bitterness , and pride of massive industry involvement are popular emotions among ACRE - nauts .
After dismissing the arguments of his critics as “ inferential dribble , ” Markowitz summarized the opposing side ’s argument thusly : “ Obviously , if you work with industry you ’re evil . ”
One of his slides encapsulated the baseline attitude of most ACRE - nauts : “ # 1 Lie in Life : Hi !
I ’m from the government and I ’m here to help you . ”
But the eeriest presentation came from one J. Michael Gonzalez - Campoy , an endocrinologist who was flown out on the ACRE - jet from Minnesota .
His job was to convince everybody that Minnesota ’s 1993 physician payment disclosure law ( the first in the nation ) was an awful mistake .
His tactic , theoretically , was a good one .
“ The law has been terrible for patients , ” he declared , speaking in the ominous tones of a doctor notifying you of grim laboratory results .
“ Oh boy , ” I thought , pen poised , “ finally , some data on the effects of transparency laws on patient outcomes . ”
But alas , Dr. Gonzalez - Campoy ’s evidence base amounted to a single patient , a 73 year old man with severe diabetes .
“ Do you know what drug he was on ? ” He asked incredulously .
“ The cheapest drug money will buy — Glyburide … .
When I asked my patient why he was on that drug , I was appalled by his answer .
He told me that his PCP said it is the most cost - effective drug . ”
It got worse : the patient had apparently been reading newspaper articles saying bad things about the newer diabetes drugs , like Avandia .
The kicker was when he told Dr. Gonzalez - Campoy that “ I ’ve read that doctors are getting brain - washed by drug companies to prescribe these drugs . ”
Do n’t you see what the Minnesota disclosure law has wrought ?
Patients getting prescribed generic medications .
Patients reading the newspaper .
Patients questioning the morals of their physicians .
“ Please learn from our mistakes , ” Dr. Gonzalez - Campoy , now impassioned , concluded .
“ Massachusetts should have asked us before they passed their law .
They did n’t . ”
Thank the Lord !
Tom Sullivan , who put together the event , sounded entertainingly like one of his blog postings — outraged , sarcastic , but with enough actual policy information to keep my attention .
Boy , is Sullivan ever pissed at Senator Herb Kohl , who has just announced a senate hearing on industry funding of CME to be held next Wednesday .
“ Senator Kohl woke up one day last week , ” he riffed , “ and decided that his staff had n’t done anything for a while , so he told them to get a hearing together . ”
I can see why Sullivan is threatened — industry - funded CME is his company Rockpointe ’s bread and butter .
There are various awards to be given .
Dr. Carey Kimmelstiel , an interventional cardiologist and a professor at my own medical school , Tufts , gets the award for whiny entitlement .
His talk was about the value of industry - supported promotional talks .
Among the benefits :
You learn a lot when you give them , you can network with your colleagues , and your colleagues learn a lot from you .
That ’s true , but has nothing to do with industry support .
It ’s possible to give the same talks to colleagues and reap the same benefits without getting a drug company check .
It ’s actually part of the job of being a medical school professor .
But this was merely the irrelevant portion of his talk .
The whiny entitled part came when he showed us an email from Doug Drachman , a Mass General cardiologist who has been organizing quarterly meetings of Boston interventional cardiologists to talk about interesting cases .
He email broke the bad news that because of the Massachusetts law banning industry from taking doctors out to fancy dinners , these meetings are being postponed .
Dr. Kimmelstiel was outraged .
Look at the unintended consequences of the gift ban law — now cardiologists can no longer meet with another .
That ’s rich .
Interventional cardiologists are some of the highest salaried professionals in the world , and yet they refuse to pay for their own dinners four times a year ?
That ’s why I call the organization Academics Craving Reimbursement for Everything .
Oddly , the best and most convincing presentation was also the shortest .
Dr. Jeffrey Garber , chief of endocrinology at Harvard Vanguard , profiled the American Association of Clinical Endocrinologists , of which he is the president .
He outlined all the good things the organization is doing to educate primary care doctors and the public about diabetes and thyroid disease , all of it funded by industry .
His point was that without industry money his organization could n’t do all these great things .
Probably true , though there are other ways for doctors to learn this information , like grand rounds , journals , and meetings that they might have to pay for themselves .
Henry Black , the President of the American Society of Hypertension , basically made the same case as Garber , arguing that his entire organization would cease to exist without drug company money .
Unfortunately , Dr. Black got the day ’s award for the most mangled slide .
In a tirade against a recent JAMA paper recommending that medical societies cease industry ties , he started insulting the individual authors , saying , essentially , that most of them are washed up has - beens .
Unfortunately , he had Dr. James Scully listed as the “ president of the Josiah Macy Foundation , ” rather than his actual job , which is the executive director of the APA .
I did n’t point it out , because he was just working up steam and was beginning to froth at the mouth .
It was the quintessential ACRE moment : fury , self - righteousness , and getting everything a little bit wrong .

The classic comedy team has been an entertainment mainstay for as long as there ’s been watchable cinema and television .
As always , it seems that we have the one ‘ straight man ’ , as it were , who represents the least idiotic of the duo .
This does n’t necessarily mean that the main lead protagonist is any less clueless than his counterpart , it just means that his innocence and idiotic demeanor just seems less pronounced .
But then we have the jelly to the comedic paring ’s peanut butter ; he is , almost always , the absolute least intelligent of not only the group , but often of the entire show .
Take , for example , the Flintstones .
We all know that between Fred and Barney , it ’s the former who maintains the highest degree of smarts and it ’s his buddy who commands levels of absurdity hitherto unknown .
And for a while , that was the classic team .
And then came a virtual pantheon of cartoons featuring pairings consisting of the smart guy , and an absolute dumb-ass of a partner .
Check these out .
The Team : Tennessee Tuxedo and Chumley
The Stupid One : Chumley the Walrus
Best friends and cohorts , Tennessee and Chumley spent their days at Megalopolis Zoo doing everything in and out of their collective power to make life a bit more comfortable .
More often , they just plain escaped only to get into all kinds of trouble in the outside world .
But , were it not for the tomfoolery of Chumley , things might have worked out differently .
Even through the efforts of educated professor , Phineas J. Whoopee , at the assist , Chumley would still find ways of acting stupid enough to foil Tennessee ’s plots .
I guess that ’s what you get for a one - of - a- kind South Pole Walrus .
The Team : Dynomutt , Dog Wonder and the Blue Falcon
The Stupid One : Dynomutt
Imagine if Fred and Scooby Doo went off on their own as a team of superheroes and Scooby somehow acquire robotic body parts and a slightly more coherent voice , then you ’d roughly have the outline for the Blue Falcon and Dynomutt .
Thankfully , Dynomutt ’s arsenal of robo - gadgetry was generally helpful , however by proxy , or else his bumbling assistance over all would have issued him a trip directly to the dump .
And man , you ’d think with all his technological advancements , someone would do something about that ridiculous laugh .
The Team : Homestar Runner
The Stupid One : The Homestar Runner
This Flash - animated web comic by the Chapman Brothers is hugely popular and widely known throughout the internet as a whole .
Basically , it plays around two titular characters : a be -gloved Luchador - style wrestler named Strong Bad , and an armless , sports fanatic who also happens to be perhaps the most genuinely innocent , yet galactically stupid character around .
Though many of his peers appear to be equally , yet oppositely , buffoonish ( see : Strong Sad , Coach Z , Homsar ) it is truly Homestar ’s severe lack of wit that propels this series .
The Team : Beavis and Butthead
The Stupid One : Beavis
Though I suppose this is like comparing which is the greener Granny Smith apple ( as they all appear to be the same ) , it seems that Beavis tends to be the dumber of the duo .
He is a severe case - study for ADHD and some obvious , yet unknown , other mental maladies .
Though Butthead leans to the more sardonic side of the relationship , he ’ll still wield his superior knowledge by admonishing and otherwise verbally abusing Beavis .
But Beavis , being the idiot , just takes it in stride while giving as good as he gets .
There ’s your best friends , right there .
The Team : Ed , Edd , and Eddy
The Stupid One : Ed
A very close - knit group combining the finer traits of a larger collection .
Ed : bat - shit crazy .
Edd : an inventing clean - freak .
Eddy :
The leader who is also the sinister conniver of the crew .
But it ’s
Ed we focus on here , as it seems he ends up somehow becoming the center point for every episode and is often the one who finds himself entangled of layers of his own ineptitude .
The Team : Dexter ’s Laboratory
The Stupid One : Dee Dee
Dexter is a boy genius .
His lab , which sits just beyond the confines of his bedroom door , occupies some humongous space likely beneath the family home , and this is his Sanctum Sanctorum .
His sister , Dee Dee , is the proverbial fly in the ointment , as well as the monkey wrench in Dexter ’s gears .
She is full of pre-teen innocence and prone to bouts of flighty , wispy whimsy that literally grates on Dexter ’s every nerve .
When she does manage to find her way into Dexter ’s lab - flitting about carelessly - she uses her prominent stupidity to wreak havoc .
The Team : Pinky and the Brain
The Stupid One : Pinky
The premise is simple :
Two mice trapped day in and day out in a community cage strive relentlessly to come up with numerous ways to take over the world .
Sure , what else are they going to do ?
The Brain is just that : brilliant , sinister , bold , and gifted with the voice of Orson Wells to boot .
Pinky , on the other hand , is a raving lunatic .
And here we have our first problem :
Pinky will manage to inadvertently sabotage Brain ’s ploys at every , stupid , turn .
The Team : The Simpsons
The Stupid One : Ralph Wiggum
I could just as easily say these next few lines , but I really like the cut of Wikipedia ’s jib : “ He is best known as the show ’s resident oddball , and has been immortalized for his non sequiturs and erratic behavior .
His lines range from nonsensical , or bizarre interpretations of a current event , to surprisingly profound statements that go over people ’s heads .
For this , Ralph is somewhat of an outcast among his peers , although he seems to be on good terms with a fair number of the major child characters on the show . ”
The Team : Ren and Stimpy
The Stupid One : Stimpson J. Cat
The two of these critters ( Ren : an Asthma - hound Chihuahua , and Stimpy : a cat ) might as well be humans .
They often live in the comforts of a realistic house ( in the later episodes ) , have furniture , and - at least in Ren ’s case most often - hold down some form of employment .
Though not related by birth , they are like brothers , or , even more oddly , like an old married couple .
But it ’s the differences that make them so opposite .
Ren is evil incarnate with a violent streak in spades , whereas Stimpy is kind , air - headed , and thick as a brick .
It ’s a match .
The Team : Spongebob Squarepants
The Stupid One : Patrick Star
Bikini Bottom is a mass of fish - life and typical goings - on of a regular above - water society .
But the best friend combo who live in a pineapple and under a rock , respectively , are Spongebob and Patrick .
Spongebob is the epitome of childhood innocence and happy - go - lucky living ; he loves his fry - cook job at the Krusty Krab almost to a fault , and spends his free time jelly fishing .
Patrick , conversely , is a bit of a mystery .
Oh , there ’s little doubt that he is colossally stupid , but there ’s something else , just beneath the surface , that ’s almost too scary to mention .

Kraft has unveiled its second attempt at naming its new spin - off from Vegemite after its disastrous launch of iSnack 2.0 .
It is Cheesybite .
After widespread public derision at the iSnack 2.0 name , chosen from a public competition , Kraft caved in last week and said it would change the name .
The public were given seven options : Cheesybite , Creamymate , Smooth , Snackmate , Vegemate , Vegemild or none of these .
In a press release this morning , the company said that 36 % of those who had voted for one of the name options had gone for Cheesybite .
This was followed by 23 % for Vegemite Smooth .

However , the results released by Kraft excluded all of those who said they did not like any of the names , which was one of the original voting options .
The company said that 30,357 expressed a name preference .
Cheesybite had 36 % followed by Smooth 23 % ; Vegemate 20 % ; Snackmate 8 % ; Vegemild 7 % ; Creamymate 6 % .
A spokesman for Kraft told Mumbrella they did not know how many of those taking part in the vote had said they did not like any of the names , but promised to have somebody call back .
( Update – about 10,000 people did not choose any of the six names )
Brisbane 's latest architectural icon - the $ 63 million Kurilpa Bridge - is now open .
The structure links Tank Street in the city to the Queensland Cultural Centre at Southbank .
Construction of the bridge began in October 2007 and is the first in the world to be built using a method that combines tension and compressed steel .
Queensland Premier Anna Bligh says it is a world - first .
" This bridge has been built using an engineering technique that balances tension and compression combiners , " she said .
" It is light weight - but incredibly strong . "
Ms Bligh says Kurilpa is a bridge for all Queenslanders - whether they live in Brisbane or visit the city regularly .
" It will be a bridge where people from around the country and around the world will come and have an opportunity to cross the beautiful Brisbane River . "
The bridge attracted controversy during construction and concerns were raised in June that an oversized truck driving on the Riverside Expressway could hit the bridge , causing major damage .
Queensland Art Gallery director Tony Elwood has had a close - up view of the bridge and says it is a work of art .
" What 's important is its confidence as a piece of design , that anything that takes a position that goes beyond something that 's quite bland is going to generate debate , " Mr Elwood said .
" But I 'd much rather see Brisbane embracing ideas that are bold and confident than not , and I fully support it .
" I look at that and I can certainly fathom the idea of it referencing boat sails , and the sort of paraphernalia of the boat , or a series of boats .
" It 's got a poetic quality that is evocative of the water , and of sails , and so on , so it 's quite appropriate as a bridge I would have thought . "
“ There are those who would suggest that we must choose between markets unfettered by even the most modest of regulationsand markets weighed down by onerous regulations that suppress the spirit of enterprise and innovation . ”
— President Barack Obama , speaking to Wall Street Monday
Knowing the president ’s unrivaled commitment to honest debate and his scorn for those who misrepresent others ’ views , I was puzzled at first upon hearing those words .
Were those resisting Obama - style regulation of Wall Street really advocating “ markets unfettered by even the most modest of regulations ” ?
I had n’t noticed this reactionary agenda , but the president surely would not lie about it — not after making such a big deal about truth - telling in his recent health - care address .
So I set out to locate these laissez - faire extremists .
Perhaps they were hunkered down at the Republican National Committee .
No , spokeswoman Kirsten Kukowski assured me , no one at her outfit fit that description .
Meanwhile , she noted , Republican leaders in Congress support “ common sense regulatory reform ” complete with . . . well , regulations .
“ The president is creating a straw man , ” she suggested , but I knew that could n’t be true .
Maybe the doctrinaire radicals he described were lodged elsewhere in the GOP power structure .
Alas , the chairman of Colorado Republicans , Dick Wadhams , was equally emphatic regarding the need for regulation .
“ This just proves that if you do n’t have his worldview of a totally regulated economy , he considers you some sort of anarchist , ” Wadhams said .
A cheap shot , obviously , and so the quest continued .
Maybe Obama had free - market think tanks in mind .
So what about it , David John of the Heritage Foundation ?
“ We ’ve had banking regulation since 1863 , ” John replied .
“ No one I know is proposing going back to 1862 . ” Heritage ’s finance expert even proposes creating a “ council of consumer financial regulators ” to deal with “ the challenges posed by complex new financial products . ”
Next up : Jon Caldara of the Independence Institute .
“ There need to be regulations in the marketplace , ” Caldara disappointingly said .
“ Government needs to be the referee . ”
Surely a libertarian outfit like the Cato Institute salivates at the thought of a regulation - free financial industry .
“ It ’s a false dichotomy , ” retorted its financial services expert , Mark Calabria .
“ Is Obama talking about the same financial services industry that everyone else is ?
You ’d have to go to the nuclear power industry to find a business more regulated than financial services . ”
Then , suddenly , a sign of hope .
“ I would certainly choose an unfettered free market over what we have now , ” Calabria admitted .
Now we ’re getting somewhere .
Still , Calabria sounded more like a realist than an absolutist , so I dialed up Doug French , president of the Ludwig von Mises Institute in Auburn , Ala .
“ Would you prefer markets unfettered by even the most modest of regulations ? ” I asked .
“ Yes , ” he replied .
At last .
“ I ’m not sure anyone in this country knows what unfettered capitalism looks like , ” French added , but — and I think he may have been joking — “ let ’s give anarchy a chance . ”
So Obama did n’t fib about the existence of laissez - faire purists .
You can find one in Alabama .
Still , the president might be more credible if he ’d stop portraying mainstream opponents as part of the fringe while refusing to acknowledge the scope of government ’s role in the market debacle .
As Calabria reminded me , nowhere in the president ’s speech did he utter the phrase “ housing bubble . ”
Nowhere do his reform proposals make a serious effort to transform incentives embedded in federal housing policy — from absurdly high FHA loan guarantees and subsidized interest rates to a host of other debt - rewarding policies — that encouraged so many consumers to get in over their heads in the first place .
Instead , the president expects us to believe that regulators with enhanced authority will short - circuit a bubble next time around .
“ The public loves a bubble when it ’s going on , ” Calabria warns .
So do politicians .
Super regulators are n’t likely to avert big bailouts .
They are far more likely to institutionalize them .

Mr Hunt said he had not decided the timing of changes to BBC governance A Conservative government could " rip up " the BBC 's royal charter , the shadow culture secretary has suggested .
The current royal charter allowing the BBC 's licence fee expires in 2015 .
But Jeremy
Hunt told the Financial Times that the corporation was " out of touch with the hard times the rest of the electorate is going through " .
He said the BBC 's structure had " failed " , adding that Tories in power would have a " very fundamental root - and - branch discussion with the BBC " .
' Cheerleader ' Mr Hunt said he had not made any decisions about the timing of any changes to the BBC 's governance .
But he said he would replace the current BBC Trust which he said acted as both cheerleader and regulator .
" We are looking into whether it would be appropriate to rip up the charter in the middle of it , or whether one should wait , " he added .
Mr Hunt said the Tories would scrap plans in the government 's digital Britain bill for a 50 p - a - month tax on all telephone lines to help pay for superfast broadband access across the UK .
He would also end proposals to require the BBC to share about £ 130 m from the licence fee with other broadcasters .
Mr Hunt added that he wanted to improve the market for commercial TV in the UK by deregulation , rather than by spending taxpayers ' money .
He said he wanted to ensure that the BBC 's dominance did not stifle the commercial sector .
Offering an example , he said : " It might sound well and good for them to have , say , an angling website , but if it drove out of business every angling magazine in the country , you would have to question if it was the right sort of thing to do . "

As the nation copes with a shortage of vaccines for H1N1 influenza , a team of Alabama researchers have raised hopes that they have found an Achilles ' heel for all strains of the flu -- antioxidants .
In an article appearing in the November 2009 print issue of the FASEB Journal , they show that antioxidants -- the same substances found in plant - based foods -- might hold the key in preventing the flu virus from wreaking havoc on our lungs .
" The recent outbreak of H1N1 influenza and the rapid spread of this strain across the world highlights the need to better understand how this virus damages the lungs and to find new treatments , " said Sadis Matalon , co-author of the study .
" Additionally , our research shows that antioxidants may prove beneficial in the treatment of flu . "
Matalon and colleagues showed that the flu virus damages our lungs through its " M2 protein , " which attacks the cells that line the inner surfaces of our lungs ( epithelial cells ) .
Specifically , the M2 protein disrupts lung epithelial cells ' ability to remove liquid from inside of our lungs , setting the stage for pneumonia and other lung problems .
The researchers made this discovery by conducting three sets of experiments using the M2 protein and the lung protein they damage .
First , frog eggs were injected with the lung protein alone to measure its function .
Second , researchers injected frog eggs with both the M2 protein and the lung protein and found that the function of the lung protein was significantly decreased .
Using molecular biology techniques , scientists isolated the segment of the M2 protein responsible for the damage to the lung protein .
Then they demonstrated that without this segment , the protein was unable to cause damage .
Third , the full M2 protein ( with the " offending " segment intact ) and the lung protein were then re-injected into the frog eggs along with drugs known to remove oxidants .
This too prevented the M2 protein from causing damage to the lung protein .
These experiments were repeated using cells from human lungs with exactly the same results .
" Although vaccines will remain the first line of intervention against the flu for a long time to come , this study opens the door for entirely new treatments geared toward stopping the virus after you 're sick , " said Gerald Weissmann , M.D. , Editor - in - Chief of the FASEB Journal , " and as Thanksgiving approaches , this discovery is another reason to drink red wine to your health .

Find out more about the international plan to allow countries and companies to offset their carbon emissions by paying poorer nations to preserve their forests
What is Redd ?
It 's a way of paying poor countries to protect their forests .
Global deforestation accounts for nearly 20 % of all CO2 emissions and all previous attempts to curb it have failed .
Redd — " Reducing Emissions from Deforestation and Degradation " would allow countries that can reduce emissions from deforestation to be paid for doing so .
Where did the idea come from ?
Papua New Guinea along with nine other countries proposed it in 2005 at a UN climate meeting .
It has gained ground and is now likely to be one of the cornerstones of any agreement at the Copenhagen climate conference in December .
It would not start until 2013 , and could eventually channel tens of billions of dollars a year from rich to poor countries .
How would it work ?
Countries would have to show , from historical data , satellite imagery and through direct measurement of trees , the extent , condition and the carbon content of their forests .
Verification , reporting and monitoring would be done by communities which depend on the forests or by independent organisations .
Who pays ?
There are several proposals .
Countries could either be paid by " voluntary funding " — rather like existing official aid given by one country to another , or cash could be linked to carbon markets .
One plan is for an international auction of emissions allowances and another proposes to issue Redd credits which would be tradable alongside existing certified emissions reductions ( CERs ) .
Companies and governments unable to meet their obligations to reduce emissions would then buy them at the international market price .
Payment for performance .
Which is best ?
Each of these three mechanisms has its strengths and weaknesses .
A growing consensus is emerging that a combination will be needed to match the different stages of development and differing needs of tropical rainforest nations .
Phase I could be funded by new and additional voluntary contributions from developed countries ; phase II would use a hybrid or market - linked mechanism ; and phase III could be funded through the carbon market .
Countries would only be paid if they can prove " monitorable , reportable and verifiable " emissions reductions
Does everyone agree ?
No .
There are 32 Redd proposals , from countries , groups of countries and NGOs .
The three gaining most ground are from Brazil , which wants a giant voluntary fund into which developed countries would provide new money .
Most rich countries propose a combination of market and fund - based mechanisms .
And the Coalition of Rainforest Nations ( Belize , Democratic Republic of Congo , Ecuador , Ghana , Guyana , and Kenya , etc ) propose using all three methods of payment .
Progress ?
There is agreement that only developing countries can participate in Redd and that it should be on a voluntary basis only .
Countries are beginning to accept that it should eventually include " carbon enhancement " ( for example tree planting , conservation ) schemes .
This is known as Redd plus .
What about Prince Charles ?
The Prince 's Rainforests Project ( PRP ) has developed a proposal for an emergency financing package for tropical forests .
Its goal is to achieve a significant reduction in tropical deforestation in the near - term by making annual payments to rainforest nations to help them embark on alternative , low - carbon development paths .
It would be funded by an innovative public - private partnership in developed countries , which could include the issuing of Rainforest Bonds .
Who stands to gain ?
In theory , the benefits are immense for everyone .
Poor communities could be paid for the first time to protect the forests they depend on .
Many new jobs would be created .
It could stimulate community forest management , and eco-tourism .
Protecting the forest would lead to better erosion control , water quality and biodiversity .
What are the problems ?
How do you measure the carbon in a forest ?
There is no accurate data on most of the world 's forested areas and so far no one agreed way to accurately measure the carbon content of vast numbers of different species of trees in different kinds of forests .
Most forested countries also do not have the money to measure and assess their forests .
What about people in the forests ?
Tens of millions of people live in and many more depend on the world 's forests for a living .
Most are traditionally marginalised or ignored by central governments .
But their lifestyles could be drastically affected if governments or carbon companies move in , valuing the forests more highly than them .
There are fears of land grabs and forced evictions .
Who owns the carbon ?
Land ownership is highly disputed in most forested countries .
Governments would have to pass new laws to refine who owns the carbon credits .
Land in some countries is owned by the communities but trees may belong to the state .
Does tree ownership confer carbon rights ?
How do you make sure that communities who protect the forests are rewarded , rather than say logging or mining companies who often have the legal rights on trees ?
What about corruption ?
Friends of the Earth International has argued that the current Redd proposals are open to abuse by corrupt politicians or illegal logging companies .
Many heavily forested countries are some of the most corrupt in the world and are home to some notorious logging companies close to politicians .
Policing forests is nearly impossible , and money is likely to be diverted by people in power .
The likelihood of international money getting to the people who depend on the forests is unlikely .
Governments can overstate the case that their forests are in danger .
What if the carbon market fails ?
The market price of carbon could collapse if too many Redd credits flooded onto the market .
With no financial incentive to protect the trees , people would revert to logging .
Last weekend Yves Smith posted a story of a family that was down on their luck and struggling with high credit card bills , including plenty of fees .
Yesterday she posted a follow - up .
Apparently the story triggered a wave of vindictive snobbery from commenters .
Here ’s one example :
“ Sounds like someone does n’t know how to manage their money .
I would bet they are making car payments and eat fast food at least 3 times a week .
Probably have cable T.V. and deluxe cell phone plans .
They probably get a new car like every two years .
What happened to her reenlistment bonuses ? ”
Here is Yves ’s response :
“ I think quite a few readers owe her an apology .
But I am also sure those readers are so locked into their Calvinist mindset that they will find some basis for criticizing this family .
Some people seem constitutionally unable to admit that success and prosperity are not the result of hard work alone . ”
First , I want to agree completely .
There is the obvious fact that a person ’s income as an adult is highly correlated with his or her parents ’ income .
( There was a recent debate about why in the blogosphere , but as far as I know no one contesting that this was the case . )
But beyond that , we all owe a tremendous amount of whatever fortune we have to luck , pure and simple .
Where would Bill Gates be if IBM had n’t decided to outsource development of the operating system for the first IBM PC ?
Rich , no doubt , but $ 50 billion rich ?
I have worked hard at enough things , and failed at enough things , and succeeded at few enough things , to know how much luck is involved .
Second , I want to go beyond that to another point that seems obvious to me , but that some will probably find controversial .
Even if differences in outcomes were entirely due to differences in abilities and effort ( which they ’re not ) — would that make it OK ?
I think most people would say that it ’s fine for smart people to make more money than other people .
But why ?
Why are smart people any more deserving than anyone else ?
It ’s true that in many jobs being smart can make you more productive and valuable , and as a result for many high - paying jobs being at least somewhat smart is a prerequisite .
But the fact that a capitalist economy functions this way does n’t make it morally right that the “ winners of the genetic lottery ” ( a phrase I picked up from some basketball announcer talking about Tony Parker ) have better outcomes than the losers .
Surely at least people who work hard deserve to do well .
In the hierarchy of American moral virtues , hard work must be right at the top .
But I ’m not convinced of that , either .
The ability to work hard is something that you either inherit from your parents or that you develop in your early childhood as a function of the environment around you .
Either way , whether or not you have it is as much a matter of luck as is your IQ .
Again , it ’s obvious that working hard increases your productivity and therefore the wages you will be paid , all other things being equal .
A small part of that differential seems “ deserved , ” since you are forgoing leisure for work .
But the differential goes far beyond that .
For example , doctors do n’t just make more money than other people to compensate them for studying hard in school and working 36 - hour shifts in residency ; studying hard and 36 - hour shifts are hurdles to clear in order to become a doctor and make a lot of money ( if you ’re a specialist , that is — some people do go through all the work and then make comparatively little ) .
Take me , for example .
I ’m smart and hard - working .
I do n’t know if it ’s because of my genes , or because my parents brought me up right .
But whatever the cause , I did n’t do anything to become smart or hard - working .
And that ’s the reason why I was able to go to good schools , get a good first job , and make more money than the average person , at least for a few years there ( before quitting to go to law school ) .
When I was young and frankly immature , being smart gave me a sense of entitlement .
Now I just feel sort of lucky ( “ sort of ” because I ’ve learned that there are many more important traits than intelligence ) .
I ’m willing to acknowledge that morality simply is n’t a factor when it comes to compensation .
Seen from a utilitarian perspective , whether hard - working people deserve more than other people is a distraction .
The key issue is that to maximize output in a more or less free market system , it has to be that way , since labor is supposed to be paid its marginal product .
But there are still two implications of realizing that everything — even your initial endowments — is a matter of chance , not something you deserve .
The first is that you should n’t look down on other people ( 1 ) because their parents were n’t as rich as yours , or ( 2 ) because they are n’t as smart as you , or even ( 3 ) because they do n’t work as hard as you .
I think most people agree with ( 1 ) ; I think you should agree with ( 2 ) and ( 3 ) , too .
The second is that the moral argument should be on the side of redistribution .
I am willing to listen to utilitarian arguments against redistribution ( e.g. , high marginal tax rates reduce the incentive to work , blah blah blah blah blah ) ; I may not agree with them , but they are a plausible position .
However , I have little patience for the idea that rich people deserve what they have because they worked for it .
It ’s just a question of how far back you are willing to acknowledge that chance enters the equation .
If you are willing to acknowledge that chance determines who you are to begin with , then it becomes obvious ( to me at least ) that public policy cannot simply seek to level the playing field , because that will just endorse a system that produces good outcomes for the lucky ( the smart and hard - working ) and bad outcomes for the unlucky .
Instead , fairness dictates that policy should attempt to improve outcomes for the unlucky , even if that requires hurting outcomes for the lucky .
But given that society is controlled by the lucky , I ’m not holding my breath .
Update : I want to respond to a comment below by Markel .
He accuses me of slipping meritocracy in through the back door with the assumption that income is correlated with intelligence and work effort .
I think he ’s right .
The point I wanted to make is that even if income is correlated with intelligence and work effort , that is n’t necessarily a good thing .
I think he ’s saying that the premise itself may be wrong , and I agree it ’s not something we should assume without support .
I wanted to assume it in the rhetorical sense , as in “ even if we assume … ” I should n’t have implied that it is a matter of fact .

Vaccine voodoo ?
Why natural medicine is inherently safer
( NaturalNews ) Vaccine mythology remains rampant in both western medicine and the mainstream media .
To hear the vaccination zealots say it , vaccines are backed by " good science , " they 've been " proven effective " and they 're " perfectly safe .
" Oh really ?
Where 's all that good science ?
As it turns out , .
Flu vaccines ( including swine flu vaccines ) are based entirely on athat assumes all vaccines work and no vaccines can be scientifically questioned .
Anyone who dares question the safety or effectiveness of vaccines is immediately branded a danger to public health and marginalized in the scientific community .
Here are ten questions vaccine - pushing doctors and health authorities absolutely refuse to answer :
Answer :
There are n't any .
( https://www.naturalnews.com/027239_vaccines_f...
Answer :
Other than " cohort studies , " there is n't any .
And the cohort studies have been thoroughly debunked .
Scientifically speaking , there is n't a scrap of honest evidence showing flu vaccines work at all .
Answer :
It is n't safe at all .
Methyl mercury is a poison .
Along with vaccine adjuvants , it explains why so many people suffer autism or other debilitating neurological side effects after being vaccinated .
Answer : Because vaccines are dangerous .
The vaccine industry routinely dismisses all such accounts -- no matter how many are reported -- as " coincidence .
" Answer : Because vitamin D can't be patented and sold as " medicine . "
You can make it yourself .
If you want more vitamin D , you do n't even need a doctor , and doctors tend not to recommend things that put them out of business .
Answer : Human genetic code is already wired to automatically defend you against invading microorganisms ( as long as you have vitamin D ) . ( https://www.naturalnews.com/027231_Vitamin_D_...
Answer :
Because those most vulnerable to influenza infections are the very same people who have a poor adaptive response to the vaccines and do n't build antibodies .
In other words .
( And even building antibodies does n't equate to real - world protection from the flu , by the way . )
Answer :
There was no change in the death rate .
You could drop vaccination rates toand you 'd still see no change in the number of people dying from the flu .
That 's because flu vaccines simply do n't work .
They can't .
The 50 % statistic is an example of .
If I have a room full of 100 people , then I take the 50 healthiest people and hand them a candy bar , I can't then scientifically claim that " candy bars make people healthy . "
That 's essentially the same logic behind the " 50 % reduction in mortality " claim of flu vaccines .
( https://www.naturalnews.com/027239_vaccines_f... ) .
Answer :
Although they claim such studies would be " unethical , " what 's far more unethical is to keep injecting hundreds of millions of people every year with useless , harmful vaccines that are n't backed by a shred of honest evidence .
The vaccine industry is about making money , not actually offering immune protection against the flu .
Whether people get the flu or not is irrelevant to the bottom - line profits of the drug companies .
What matters most is that people continue to take the flu shots , and making that happen depends entirely on pushing thethat infects the minds of doctors and health authorities today .
There was a time when all " good " doctors believed in bloodletting .
Sickness was caused by evil spirits , they thought , and releasing pints of blood from the patient would clear the evil spirits and accelerate healing .
Any doctor who questioned the science behind bloodletting was called a " denier . "
All the " good " doctors said , " We know bloodletting works , so we do n't need science to back it up .
" Today , you hear the exact same thing about vaccines .
" We know they work , " doctors claim , " so we do n't need any real science to back it up . "
Anyone who questions the safety of flu vaccines ( or H1N1 vaccines ) is branded a " denier . "
Anyone who asks for solid scientific evidence supporting the efficacy of vaccines is called a troublemaker .
They do n't need any evidence .
They already know vaccines work .
With that being the case , Why not just call it VOODOO ?
Why not accompany vaccines with the wave of a magic wand and some shamanic chanting ?
Maybe doctors should tell their patients to cross their fingers before being injected with a vaccine because " that makes it work better .
" Seriously ..
They are following the exact same " quackery " they accuse other of pursuing .
This brings me to an important observation about modern medicine : MY quackery is okay , but YOUR quackery is n't !
That 's the attitude of vaccine - pushing doctors and health authorities .
As long as the quackery is widely agreed upon by the medical masses , then to heck with actual scientific evidence .
Of course , these vaccine devotees might say , well , you do n't have any good evidence to support your anti-viral herbs , or your medicinal teas , or your vitamin D nutrition either .
But in saying that , they miss the whole point : that have been part of the human experience for as long as humans have roamed this planet .
A chemical injection with a sharp needle that pierces the skin , on the other hand , is extremely interventionist .
It 's unnatural and in many ways quite radical .
As such , it demandsthan something that human beings have evolved with over time .
Foods , herbs and natural medicines have been around for millions of years .
Vaccines have existed for less than a hundred years , and routine season flu vaccinations have really only been pushed hard for less than twenty years ..
They are n't natural , they are n't compatible with human biology , and they contain extremely toxic substances that clearly do not belong in the human body .
Given such extremes , the burden of proof for both safety and efficacy of vaccines falls onto those who would advocate them .
And yet , to this day , no such proof has been offered ... or is even pursued .
There is n't even a plan in place to someday find out if flu vaccines really work .
The whole plan is to just pursue " business as usual " and keep injecting people whether it really works or not .
Vaccine needles would be far more honest if they were shaped like question marks .
Seriously .
You would have the same level of protection from the flu if you brought your ownto the clinic and had them inject that with the vaccine instead of you !
That 's an interesting idea , actually .
We could really reduce national health care costs if we just administered western medicines to our voodoo dolls instead of our actual bodies .
Got cancer ?
Just poison your voodoo doll with chemotherapy .
Side effects are almost non-existent .
Need heart bypass surgery ?
Just have them operate on the doll ( it 's far less complicated ) .
Want some protection from the winter flu ?
Just vaccinate the doll .
It 's quick and painless .
The results would be no worse than what people are experiencing right now .
In fact , in most cases they might actually be better .
A new study coauthored by Ian Kuijt , associate professor of anthropology at the University of Notre Dame , describes recent excavations in Jordan that reveal evidence of the world 's oldest known granaries .
The appearance of the granaries represents a critical evolutionary shift in the relationship between people and plant foods .
Anthropologists consider food storage to be a vital component in the economic and social package that comprises the Neolithic period , contributing to plant domestication , increasingly sedentary lifestyles and new social organizations .
It has traditionally been assumed that people only started to store significant amounts of food when plants were domesticated .
However , in a paper appearing in the June 23 edition of the Proceedings of the National Academies of Sciences , Kuijt and Bill Finlayson , director , Council for British Research in the Levant , describe recent excavations at Dhra ' near the Dead Sea in Jordan that provide evidence of granaries that precede the emergence of fully domesticated plants and large - scale sedentary communities by at least 1,000 years .
" These granaries reflect new forms of risk reduction , intensification and low - level food production , " Kuijt said .
" People in the Pre-Pottery Neolithic Age ( 11,500 to 10,550 B.C. ) were not using new food sources , but rather , by developing new storage methods , they altered their relationship with traditionally utilized food resources and created the technological context for later development of domesticated plants and an agro- pastoralist economy .
" Building granaries may , at the same time , have been the single most important feature in increasingly sedentism that required active community participation in new life - ways . "
Designed with suspended floors for air circulation and protection from rodents , the granaries are located between residential structures that contain plant - processing instillations .
The new studies are a continuation of earlier research by Kuijt .
As a graduate student from 1987 - 1995 , he worked on and directed several field projects in Jordan that focused on the world 's first villages during the Neolithic Period .
As part of this research , he did several days of excavation at Dhra ' with a Jordanian researcher .
This was followed by several other field projects and by research from 2000 to 2005 with Finlayson .
" These granaries are a critical fist step , if not the very evolutionary and technological foundation , for the development of large agricultural villages that appear by 9,500 to 9,000 years ago across the Near East , " Kuijt said .
" In many ways food storage is the missing link that helps us understand how so many people were able to live together .
And much to our surprise , it appears that they developed this technology at least a 1,000 years before anyone thought they did . "
The Dhra ' research was funded by grants from Notre Dame , the National Science Foundation and the British Academy .
Kuijt , who joined the Notre Dame faculty in 2001 , has worked extensively on Old and New World research projects .
His research interests include the emergence of social inequality , prehistoric mortuary practices , the origins of agriculture , paleoenvironmental change and human adaptations , and lithic technology , He is the co-editor of " Complex Hunter Gathers : Evolution and Organization of Prehistoric Communities on the Plateau of Northwestern North America " and " Life in Neolithic Farming Communities : Social Organization , Identity , and Differentiation . "
Harris County Precinct 6 Constable Victor Treviño suspended the use of Tasers by his officers Thursday based on the manufacturer 's warnings that the device could pose a “ low risk ” of heart troubles if fired into a person 's chest .
Treviño said he wants legal advice and more research before deciding whether deputies may resume using the 50,000 - volt stun guns .
Around 25 of his deputies carry Tasers , which they paid for from their own pockets .
“ It concerned me , that report I read , ” Treviño said .
“ Even having the probability that they have linked the Taser to a heart attack — some possibility — is just enough for me to stop it immediately .
I 'd rather play it safe . ”
Deputies with the Precinct 1 Constable 's Mental Health Unit — who serve all mental health warrants in city limits and across Harris County — and the Precinct 3 Constable 's offices will continue using Tasers unless the County Attorney 's office advises otherwise , supervisors at those law enforcement agencies said .
The remaining five constables ' offices in Harris County do not use Tasers .
Aiming lower
Houston police and the Harris County Sheriff 's Office have also said they will continue using the stun guns since they already train officers to avoid firing Tasers into a person 's sensitive areas and to instead aim for a large muscle mass , such as the back .
Treviño said he was startled by the advisories issued last week by Taser International , which urged officers using the device to lower their aim a few inches to a person 's “ lower center mass ” — from the sternum on down — to help “ avoid any potential controversy ” or lawsuits if someone dies after being zapped .
“ The studies and the research I read before never even indicated there was a link to this possibly causing heart attacks or some heart damage , ” Treviño said .
Several Harris County constables ' offices said Thursday they have never used Tasers because of safety concerns .
“ I 've not yet been convinced of the safety , so I just never have authorized it , ” said Precinct 4 Constable Ron Hickman , noting lack of funds also precluded their use .
Constables ' offices in Harris County Precincts 2 , 5 , 7 and 8 also do not allow their deputies to use Tasers .
“ We 're not saying that they do n't work ...
But I 'm over the internal affairs division , and I 'm just a little leery about just cutting them loose and the liability issue .
There have been lots of incidents where you 've had heart attacks , injuries due to this , ” said Precinct 2 Constable 's Sgt. Gilbert Phillips .
The County Attorney 's office has not yet decided whether to recommend any policy changes but is researching the matter and has contacted Taser International for more information , said First Assistant Marc Hill .
“ It is clear from what we have looked at that Tasers , when used properly , have saved lives and reduced injuries of law enforcement officers and civilians , ” Hill said .

DEBKAfile
January 30 , 2012
According to exclusive reports reaching DEBKAfile , President Bashar Assad Sunday , Jan. 30 , pulled in the Syrian Republican Guard and the 4th armored divisions commanded by his brother Maher Assad from the northern rebel centers and over to Damascus .
He ordered them into battle positions in the capital for the first time in the ten month uprising after receiving an intelligence tipoff that western powers had won over one of the armored division commanders posted in the capital and persuaded him to stage a coup d’etat to topple him .
The renegade general , whose identity is unknown , was reported to be planning to take advantage of the absence of the most trusted regime troops in trouble spots across the country to lead 300 tanks into the capital and seize power .
The conspirators were planning to make their move on the night of Monday Jan. 30 or early Tuesday Jan. 31 , just before the UN Security Council was to convene in New York and air plans for him to step down .
The putsch would have presented its members with the accomplished fact of Assad ’s overthrow by the military .
The information passed to Assad , apparently from an external source , did not name the division commander who accepted this role from Western hands .
If it turns out to be true , the scheme would strongly recall the US - led NATO - Qatari - Jordanian operation for the Libyan rebels to seize power in Libya by taking Tripoli by storm in the third week of August 2011 .
The Rest …HERE
Forewarned , the Syrian ruler is making every effort to ward off the threatened coup .
DEBKA file ’s military sources report that , aside from the Republican Guard and 4th division which Assad recalled to the capital , present there too are the 1st , 3rd and 9th armored divisions .
Networking is n't just about routers and switches anymore .
In a series of announcements today made by Networking vendor Juniper Networks ( NYSE : JNPR ) made a series of announcements today that reflect a revamping of its business around new processing silicon , networking systems and software .
Juniper 's new efforts are designed around speeding up networking with a combination of silicon enhanced systems and expanded software .
The announcements come on the same day Juniper is being listed on the NYSE , which itself is a Juniper customer .
In addition to detailing the new releases during a morning press conference , Juniper execs also took aim at rivals Alcatel - Lucent ( NYSE : ALU ) and Cisco ( NASDAQ : CSCO ) on the topic of who provides the best performance .
" We need to get past the thinking that 's networking is about a box , " Juniper CEO Kevin Johnson said during the morning press conference .
In Johnson 's view the new networking equation is all about fostering an open ecosystem and not forcing single box point solutions on users .
In order to power the vision of the new network , Johnson noted that it takes processing power in silicon .
To that end , Juniper today announced its new Junos Trio silicon which offers up to 604 Gbps of I /O capacity .
Juniper 's founder and CTO , Pradeep Sindhu said that with a Junos Trio you could download the entire Library of Congress in one minute .
Sindhu said there are four key chipsets that make up the Junos Trio .
The first chipset is the lookup engine , which has a new instruction set for packet processing .
Sindhu said the new engine was 20 times more efficient than the current generation of silicon and that Juniper has 30 patents that chipset .
The second chip in Trio is the memory engine , which has bandwidth capacity of 120 Gbps .
The third chip does fine grain queuing , dividing up bandwidth in a granular way enabling operators to have full quality of service control .
The fourth chip on the Trio silicon is the interface engine which provides Ethernet capabilities .
" This quantum jump increase in performance also increases the scale of the systems we can build , " Sindhu said .
" Packet forwarding is faster , power efficiency is better and latency is better . "
Tripling platform capacity
The first Juniper systems that will benefit from the Trio silicon are Juniper 's MX series routers .
The MX 3D , is a new interface module powered by Junos Trio and triples the capacity of existing platforms .
For example Juniper 's MX 960 router on its own can deliver 960 Gbps of bandwidth but with the MX 3D it can now deliver 2.6 Terabits per second .
In addition to tripling the power of its existing MX routers , Juniper is also announcing a new smaller router called the MX 80 which provides 80 Gbps in a three and a half inch chassis .
Kim Perdikou , executive vice president at Juniper , said that the new platforms offered more performance capacity than rivals Cisco and Alcatel - Lucent .
Just yesterday , Alcatel - Lucent launched its own smaller router platforms while Cisco has been busy this year updating its portfolio as well .
Project Falcon
Juniper is also ramping up its mobile networking effort through its Project Falcon initiative .
Perdikou explained that Falcon is all about building a mobile packet core for Juniper 's universal edge routers .
As part of it New Network initiative Juniper is also expanding its core Junos operating system .
Junos is the core operating platform for nearly all of Juniper 's routing and switching gear and is updated ever quarter .
Junos Space is a new network application platform and Junos Pulse is a new integrated network client for provisioning and management .
" We 're strongly confident that this next decade ahead , the industry must take a different approach , " Juniper CEO Kevin Johnson said .
" And we challenge everyone in the networking industry to be thoughtful of what value they can bring to the table to help solve problems . "
PADANG , Indonesia ( CNN ) --
As many as 4,000 people could be buried under the rubble in the aftermath of the devastating earthquakes in Indonesia , United Nations officials said Saturday .
Indonesian soldiers crawl under the rubble of a collapsed building to search for victims .
Local disaster management officials put the death toll from the quakes at 540 .
Earlier U.N. figures that put the death toll at 1,100 were just estimates , said El - Mostafa Benlamlih , a U.N. humanitarian coordinator .
A 7.6 - magnitude quake struck Sumatra on Wednesday and a 6.6 - magnitude earthquake hit Thursday morning in the same region .
Wednesday 's quake reduced buildings to rubble in the city .
People used hammers , chisels and bare hands to dig through debris for survivors and belongings .

Staff at a local hospital treated the injured outside the semi-collapsed building as bodies of the dead lay in makeshift morgues .
An area that now looks like a flattened mess of destruction was , just days ago , a group of three villages .
Officials believe 90 percent of the residents -- as many as a few hundred people -- were buried , just one piece of the devastation from two large earthquakes that struck Indonesia in as many days .
The stench of dead bodies fills the air .
Indonesia 's health ministry and ministry of social affairs said Friday they believe thousands remain buried beneath rubble .
Impact Your World See how you can make a difference
The West Sumatran capital , Padang , with about a million residents , is near the epicenter .
CNN 's Arwa Damon spoke with a few dozen survivors from these villages in the area , most of whom only made it through because they were n't home during the quake .
They remained huddled together in a tent , in shock over what had happened .
One older woman said eight of her family members were buried .
She had been buried up to her chest and had to dig herself out .
Another survivor , a 27 - year - old man , told CNN four of his family members were killed .
His home used to be on top of a cliff in the area .
Now , there is only mud .
Search and rescue teams are working with the military , but so far , only 25 bodies have been recovered .
With each passing day , the scope of the devastation grows .

President Obama spoke with Indonesian President Susilo Bambang Yudhoyono on Friday after trying several times to reach him , the White House said .
Obama received an update on the situation on the ground from Yudhoyono in the five - minute call .
The White House statement says Obama " offered , on behalf of the United States , to do everything we can to help alleviate the suffering and provide assistance to the relief operation . "
The U.N. 's Holmes told reporters Thursday that hundreds are believed to be injured .
" These numbers , I fear , will rise as more information becomes available , " he added .
Telecommunications are difficult in the region , roads are cut off , and the hardest - hit area , including Padang , lacks power and other services , Holmes said .
In addition , heavy rainfall has hindered search and rescue efforts .
Some have suggested the damage may be worse than that of a 6.3 - magnitude quake centered in the central Java city of Yogyakarta in May 2006 , Holmes said .
That temblor killed more than 5,000 people and triggered fears of an eruption from a nearby volcano .
Many people wandered the streets of Padang stunned and dazed .
Some searched the rubble for survivors .
Staff at a local hospital treated the injured outside the semi-collapsed building as bodies of the dead lay in makeshift morgues .
Several of the hospital 's buildings were severely damaged .
Damage in the town itself was spotty ; some buildings remained intact near others in ruins .
" Aftershocks can be just as devastating as the initial quake , " said Adjie Fachrurrazi , emergency response coordinator in Indonesia for the CARE aid organization , in a statement .
" After an earthquake of this size , we know the immediate needs are going to be getting safe water , food and emergency supplies to the survivors .
The question now is :
How bad is it ?
We 're hoping for the best , but the information so far is not looking good . "
Amelia Merrick , the operations director for World Vision Indonesia , described the situation as " quite devastating . "
" Bridges have gone down , phone lines are in total disrepair , " she said .
" It 's difficult for us to assess the situation . "
Earlier this month , an earthquake in West Java killed 57 people .

Herbert Hoover and the start of the Great Depression
Lee Ohanian
What started the Great Depression ?
This column says that the industrial decline began before monetary contraction or banking panics – the conventional culprits – took hold .
It attributes the massive drop in manufacturing hours to President Hoover ’s labour policies , which kept nominal and real wages high .
Our current crisis continues to draw parallels to the Great Depression ( Eichengreen and O’Rourke 2009 ) and has refocused attention on the 1930s .
Several features of the US Depression , particularly its early phases , represent challenges to economic theory .
These features , describe below in more detail , suggest that non-monetary , non-banking factors were important – in particular Herbert Hoover ’s cartelisation and wage - setting policies .
In a recent paper , I consider the relationship between these facts and the start of the Depression , as well as the way in which it unfolded ( Ohanian 2009 ) .
Several of these features of the Depression are not widely known , one of which is that the Depression was initially very severe in the industrial sector .
Per-capita industrial hours worked declined by nearly 30 % by the fall of 1930 , roughly a year after the Depression started , which contrasts with the widely held view that the Depression started as a “ garden variety ” recession .
Standard explanations
Economists cite monetary contraction ( Friedman and Schwartz , 1963 ) and banking panics ( Bernanke , 1983 ) as important determinants of the Depression , but industry was significantly depressed before either of these factors was quantitatively important .
The attached figure shows per-capita industrial hours worked between January 1929 and September 1930 , and two measures of the money stock from Friedman and Schwartz that roughly correspond to M1 and M2 .
Hours decline substantially , but these two measures of the money supply fall only about 4 % , and 1 % , respectively .
Moreover , there are no significant banking panics during this early stage of the Depression .
Friedman and Schwartz date the first banking panic occurring from November 1930 until January 1931 , but this first episode is after industrial hours have fallen 30 % .
Moreover , Wicker ( 1996 ) argues that this first banking episode did not have important macroeconomic effects , which he states is also consistent with the views of Friedman and Schwartz .
Figure 1 .
Manufacturing hours and the money supply
Index : January 1929 = 100 for both series .
This indicates that a factor other than monetary contraction or bank runs was central in initiating the Depression .
Moreover , this factor impacted the economy very differently across sectors .
Hours worked in agriculture , which had roughly the same employment share as industry at that time , were roughly unchanged during the early 1930s , which indicates that the initiating factor behind the Depression was sector - specific .
Labour market data indicate that this factor impacted the economy by creating a labour market failure that prevented the industrial labour market from clearing .
Nominal industrial wages declined little during the early stages of the Depression .
Figure 3 from my paper shows both nominal and real manufacturing wages .
Both micro and macro analyses suggest that these wages were above their market clearing levels .
Curtis Simon ( 2000 ) analysed newspaper “ situation wanted ” advertisements in the 1930s , which were taken out by job seekers .
Simon found that the supply price of labour – the wage rate being asked for by job seekers in their ads – was well below the wage rates that were being paid .
Before the Depression , there was very little difference between the wage being asked for by job seekers and the wage being paid .
In contrast , nominal wages in agriculture fell significantly , and agricultural employment changed very little at this time .
Mulligan ( 2005 ) and Chari , Kehoe , and McGrattan ( 2007 ) use aggregate data and reach a similar conclusion about an industrial labour market distortion by showing that there is a large deviation in the standard first order condition that equates the marginal rate of substitution between aggregate consumption and leisure to the real wage during the 1930s .
These studies show that the marginal rate of substitution is much too low relative to the wage .
Mulligan ( 2005 ) also shows that explanations such as changes in tax rates or transfers cannot plausibly account for the large gap in this condition .
This evidence also suggests that the industrial wage was above its market - clearing level .
Basic economics
The basic economics from these analyses boils down to the following question :
With substantial depression in the industrial sector , why did n’t the normal forces of supply and demand operate to lower the wage and raise output and hours worked ?
I develop a theory to address this question of labour market failure based on President Hoover ’s cartelisation and wage policies .
Hoover ’s views about competition and labour are clearly described in his memoirs ( Hoover , 1951 ) .
Hoover thought that there was too much competition in the American economy in the 1920s and believed that industrial cooperation and codes of “ fair competition ” among business in the same industry would generate superior economic outcomes .
Not surprisingly , Hoover ’s initiatives that helped industry develop collusive trade groups fostered high industrial concentration and substantial monopoly distortions during this period ( see Kovacic and Shapiro , 2000 ) .
Hoover ’ views about wages also differ considerably from today ’s views .
Many economists interpret high real wages as reflecting worker productivity that results from a skilled labour force working with a large stock of capital and efficient technologies .
But Hoover believed that increasing wages in and of itself was important for promoting prosperity , as he apparently discounted the impact of higher wages on business hiring decisions .
Hoover ’s economic views set the stage for meetings he held at the White House with major industry in late 1929 and advised them not to cut wages .
Hoover told industry that maintaining wage levels would minimise the severity of a downturn and help him keep the peace with labour .
Hoover also advised firms to share work among employees rather than relying exclusively on layoffs .
Hoover then asked labour leaders not to strike and to withdraw requests for higher wages .
Following these meetings , industry publicly acknowledged their compliance with Hoover ’s labour programme as they held wage rates fixed and shared work among employees .
And Hoover ’s programme did keep the industrial peace – there was very little new unionisation or strikes during this period .
But declining prices and productivity , coupled with Hoover ’s programme of fixing wages , significantly increased industrial labour costs .
As the industrial decline intensified , industry leaders asked Hoover if he would support wage cuts that were proportional to the deflation that had occurred .
But Hoover declined despite increasing criticism from various quarters that his programme was keeping wages far above their market - clearing levels .
Many large firms kept their pledge with Hoover until the fall of 1931 , at which point industrial hours worked had declined by nearly 40 % .
I construct a growth model to analyse Hoover ’s contribution to the start of the Depression that is similar to the model in Cole and Ohanian ( 2004 ) , which analysed the contribution of Roosevelt 's cartelisation and wage - fixing policies .
To account for the fact that Hoover ’s policy did not impact the entire economy , I specify a two - sector model in which the industrial sector is directly impacted by Hoover ’s programme and the other sector ( agriculture ) is not subject to this program .
The impact of Hoover ’s policy is analysed by feeding in the observed real manufacturing wage into the industrial sector of the economy .
The industrial wage is exogenous from the perspective of firms in that industry , and I interpret this wage as the product of Hoover ’s nominal wage maintenance programme and deflation .
The model also includes lower productivity in the industrial sector , which further increases labour costs .
Lower productivity in the model is specified as an exogenously reduced workweek ( lower capital utilisation ) , though this could be modelled as another factor that depresses productivity and it would have the same effect on hiring decisions .
I find that Hoover ’s programme generates a significant depression in the model , reducing real GDP by about 18 % by the end of 1931 , which accounts for about 2/3 of the Depression at that stage .
The analysis is also consistent with the observed asymmetry across sectors , as industrial hours worked decline much more than agricultural hours .
This asymmetry in sectoral responses in the model reflects the fact that the Hoover programme directly impacts the industrial sector , which then spills over to the agricultural sector because industrial output and agricultural output are complements and thus leads to a more moderate decline in agriculture .
Explaining the immediacy
The paper provides a theory for why the Depression was so immediately severe before significant monetary contraction and banking panics , why the Depression was so asymmetric across sectors , and also provides a theory for the industrial labour market failure – the fact that industrial wages were persistently well above their market - clearing level .
This analysis , and my earlier work with Harold Cole ( Cole and Ohanian 2004 ) , suggests that the US economy of the 1930s would not have been as severely depressed if cartelisation and wage fixing policies had not been adopted .
Ebell and Ritschl ( 2008 ) present a similar theory of the Depression by analysing the contribution of increased labour bargaining power on the economy in a search and matching framework and find that labour policy changes are central for understanding the Great Depression , including the enormous stock market decline .
While Hoover - type labour policies are not the central problem in today ’s crisis , some economists are more broadly drawing parallels between labour market distortions of the 1930s and today and the contribution of public policy in generating those distortions .
Casey Mulligan ( 2009a ) shows that today ’s crisis also features an increasing gap between the marginal rate of substitution between consumption and leisure and the real wage , and he interprets this gap as the consequence of public policies that implicitly – and substantially – raise the tax rate on debtors who have borrowed on assets whose value has fallen and impose large changes in marginal tax rates as a consequence of tax credits that are available only at certain income levels ( see Mulligan 2009b , 2009c ) .
While more research is needed on both of these episodes , the analyses cited in this article suggests that government policies that distorted labour markets are important for understanding both the 1930s and today .

PITTSBURGH 
These are the new Cincinnati Bengals .
No longer a pass - happy , defensively meek team that has been to the playoffs only once in the last 18 years , they have finally come to resemble the team that Coach Marvin Lewis said he wanted all along : one with a ball - control offense and a defense he can rely on .
That was demonstrated Sunday in the Bengals ’ 18 - 12 win against the defending Super Bowl champion Pittsburgh Steelers , the Bengals ’ co-leader atop the American Football Conference North entering the game .
“ That ’s a big win , ” Lewis said .
“ It ’s a grinding football game , probably the most physical , grinding football game I ’ve ever been on the sideline to experience . ”
Combined with their victory over the Steelers in the teams ’ first game this season , the Bengals swept the regular - season series with Pittsburgh for the first time since 1998 .

Did Henry Paulson , George W. Bush ’s
Treasury secretary , break the law ?
According to a new book on the financial meltdown by New York Times reporter Andrew Ross Sorkin , in June 2008 , Paulson , who was the chairman of Goldman Sachs before joining the Bush administration , held a secret meeting in Moscow with the board of directors of his former employer .
The problem for Paulson — then and possibly now — was that after he had been nominated in 2006 to the Treasury post he had signed an ethics letter vowing to stay clear of potential conflicts of interest with Goldman Sachs and promising not to take any action that might affect the firm ’s ability to cover his multimillion - dollar pension .
As Sorkin recounts the episode , Paulson and the Goldman Sachs board happened to be in Moscow at the same time .
Learning of this coincidence , Paulson asked his chief of staff , Jim Wilkinson , to set up a meeting .
Wilkinson was not happy about this .
“ For fuck ’s sake ! ” he thought , according to Sorkin .
Paulson told him that the meeting could be considered a social gathering , but as Wilkinson worked out the details with the Goldman Sachs crowd , he asked that the session remain confidential .
And the event was not placed on Paulson ’s official calendar .
When Paulson and the firm ’s execs got together at the Moscow Marriott Grand Hotel , the Treasury secretary gave the Goldman Sachs crew his read on what was happening with the economy and his department ’s effort to prepare for handling failed banks .
He also previewed for them an important speech he would soon deliver .
That is , he privately shared his views on matters of direct interest to his old firm .
And as Sorkin points out , Paulson had at this point never provided such a briefing to any other company ( except for once “ briefly dropping by ” a cocktail party for the board of BlackRock ) .
In September 2008 , as the economy imploded , Paulson obtained an ethics waiver that would permit him to deal with Goldman Sachs .
But at the time of the Moscow meeting , he was still covered by his original ethics agreement .
And two government watchdog groups now say that Paulson seems to have broken ethics laws when he hobnobbed with his former firm ’s top brass .
Danielle Brian , the executive director of the Project on Government Oversight , tells Mother Jones :
Henry Paulson ’s meeting with the board of directors of his former employer , Goldman Sachs , appears to be a serious violation of ethics laws .
Given that the meeting took place in the summer of 2008 — months before he received an ethics waiver allowing him to participate in matters that would affect his Goldman pension — it was completely inappropriate for Paulson to discuss internal matters at the Treasury Department , and to preview an important speech he was about to deliver .
This could potentially be a criminal or civil matter .
Melanie Sloan , the executive director of Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington , says Congress should investigate Paulson ’s actions .
It ’s hard to imagine why he thought such a meeting would be okay .
It seems he was having a conversation in violation of the [ ethics ] ban .
It was n’t purely social — purely social is when you do n’t discuss business .
You talk about movies , books , your kids , but not what the Treasury Secretary is going to talk about next week .
That ’s basically inside information that the Goldman board received .
It certainly merits further inquiry with people who were there about what exactly Paulson said to them and whether they acted on that information .
It seems like Congress might want to ask some questions of Goldman .
Whether or not this meeting actually violated the law , it was untoward enough to cause Paulson ’s chief of staff to fret and for Paulson to keep the gathering hidden .
In retrospect , it was quite a lapse in judgment for a fellow who soon would be asking the American taxpayers for a $ 700 billion blank check — part of which would go to help the mega - investment bank he once ran .
Paulson ’s PR rep did not return a call and email seeking comment .
October 14th , the Obama administration 's principal piece of financial service reform legislation , the Consumer Financial Protection Agency , will be up for committee consideration in the House Financial Services Committee .
The most important thing to know about the bill ?
It creates a new federal agency in Washington whose sole purpose is to protect consumers from the deceptive tricks and traps of the financial services industry .
The most important thing to know about the committee reviewing the bill ?
It 's on FIRE .
The Sunlight Foundation has documented that the Finance , Insurance and Real Estate ( FIRE ) industries have a huge stake in everything that happens in the committee and they invest heavily in certain committee members .
Just take a look at this chart by Sunlight and Opensecrets.org :
Take Congresswoman Melissa Bean ( D - IL ) , for instance , she is the top recipient on the committee of FIRE campaign finance dollars in 2009 .
She is also one of the biggest threats to meaningful reform .
Evidently , Bean 's take away from the financial crisis -- which threw 7 million Americans out of work and cost taxpayers $ 3 trillion -- is that consumers need less protection not more .
According to watchdogs at Public Citizen , Bean is planning to introduce an amendment to the CFPA bill tomorrow which would take away the right of states to protect consumers more aggressively than the feds .
That 's what got us into this mess in the first place .
Many years before the 2008 financial crisis , state attorneys general ( AGs ) noticed a big problem in their communities .
Angry consumers descended upon their offices to complain about a new type of predatory - lending in the housing sector .
Consumers were being offered deceptive teaser rates on mortgages that later skyrocketed .
There was a raft of undisclosed charges and fees .
The interest rates eventually ballooned beyond their ability to pay , and they started losing their homes .
Many state AGs started investigating , demanding answers and cracking down on abusive mortgage lenders .
As early as 2002 , a group of AGs went to court to force one of the worst offenders , Household International , to repay customers a record breaking $ 484 million and reform its lending practices .
These state top cops recognized the predatory lending boom as a national problem , demanding a national response .
Some looked to Washington , D.C. for help .
But rather than jumping on board to clamp down on the phony mortgage machine , federal regulators went in a different direction .
The Federal Reserve and the Security and Exchange Commission looked the other way .
Worse , in 2003 , authorities at the obscure Office of the Comptroller of the Currency issued new rules that preempted many state enforcement actions and protected the banks .
Yup that 's right , top bank regulators in Washington sided with the crooks and not the cops .
Just think if it all could have been stopped in the first year or two that the scams was unveiled .
Just think if consumers had an advocate for them in Washington , D.C. working hand and hand with the authorities at the state level .
Maybe the whole mortgage meltdown could have been avoided .
It 's time to put out the FIRE on Capitol Hill .
The House Financial Services Committee needs to pass a strong bill , one that does not preempt states and polices both banks and nonbanks offering a wide range of financial goods and services to consumers .
Anything less will surely lead to the next conflagration .

NABATIEH , Lebanon —
The pock marks on the walls of 45 - year - old Salima Barakat 's house are not unusual for this part of southern Lebanon .
Bullet and shrapnel marks of varying ages remind longtime residents of the many wars and occupations , notably the 2006 conflict between Israel and Hezbollah .
Less visable are the scars on Salima 's own body , which also tell a story — that of one of millions of cluster bombs dropped by Israel during the 2006 offensive .
It landed in Salima 's kitchen , exploded and left shrapnel lodged in various parts of her anatomy .
“ It tore my intestines open , ” says Barakat , pulling at her stomach through her acid - green overgarment .
“ My fingers were hurt and some hit my head .
Some fragments came through the sole of my foot up to the upper foot and it still hurts . ”
The 2006 conflict also added to the layers of mines laid in previous conflicts , wars and occupations .
Some 205 square kilometers of Lebanese soil remain contaminated — 165 square kilometers by mines and some 40 square kilometers by cluster bombs .
Particularly hard - hit is southern Lebanon , where the local economy is dependent on agriculture .
In Salima 's olive grove , 10 of the trees were felled during the conflict and the rest did n't bear olives for two years , she says .
Southern Lebanon 's agricultural output is estimated to have shrunk 25 percent due to contaminated land and damaged plantations .
But on the hill slopes around Salima 's house , several de-mining teams are hard at work trying to win back precious terrain and reverse the fortunes of the people living here .
From afar , they look like clusters of beetles , their helmets , visors and body armor glistening occasionally under the hot Lebanese sun .
A de-miner scans for expolsives .
( Don Duncan / GlobalPost )
“ Now we have a really big effect , ” says Hamad Dothman , 34 , a site manager for U.K. - based de-mining NGO Mine Action Group ( MAG ) .
He oversees several teams at work not far from Salima Barakat 's house .
“ You can see all the locals now planting their land and building their new houses and you can see many new constructions . ”
But these days , the teams are never sure if they will be back at work the following week .
De-mining in Lebanon has all but ground to a halt since the global recession hit .
Lebanon was one of the land mine hot spots in the world that was within sight of full clearance .
Experts envisaged a Lebanon free of land mines and cluster bombs as early as the end of next year .
But that was before the money began to dry up .
Since 2007 , the number of de-mining teams clearing Lebanese soil has shrunk almost threefold to just over 40 teams .
Many of the NGOs have had to pull their Lebanese teams and refocus their resources on more acute mine hot spots , such as Iraq , Gaza and the Republic of Congo .
“ The war in Lebanon occurred three years ago and since then we have had earthquakes , and major wars , ” said Christine Bennike , Lebanon country manager for Mine Advisory Group .
“ So of course funding will be realigned to where the most recent disaster or needs are . ”
For people living here , this realignment simply means the mines — and the danger and hardship they bring — will be around for much longer .
“ It also means there will be an increased number of civilian casualties , ” Bennike says .
“ These are the negative results of lack of funding . ”
Remaining NGOs like Mine Advisory Group are having to shake foreign governments — their traditional funding sources — harder for cash .
But they 're also having to innovate and develop new funding models in order to stay operational .
“ We 're only limited by our imaginations , ” said Bennike , who spends much of her time researching and writing up grant proposals to unlock funds to replace those she once could rely on from foreign governments .
To many Lebanese , mine clearance has been somewhat an international problem solved with international money — until now .
The funding crisis and the disappearance of de-mining NGOs is shifting the issue squarely into the domestic realm .
The Lebanese Army is having to pick up the slack left in the wake of departing NGOs by training and putting its own teams out on the field .
The next step is to open and stimulate domestic channels of funding to the problem .
“ This is Lebanon and we'd like the Lebanese to start to participate in funding and providing support for us , ” Bennike said .
In the meantime , Lebanon 's dwindling army of de-miners will continue their increasingly painstaking task and Salima Barakat , like much of southern Lebanon , awaits her olive grove to bear a full harvest once again .

Observations suggest the early Universe is ripe for exploration .
The GRB 090423 γ- ray burst happened just 630 million year after the Big Bang .
NASA / Swift / Stefan Immler
Two teams have spied a huge blast from the far reaches of our early Universe .
Such γ-ray bursts occur when certain massive stars violently explode .
The latest burst happened a mere 630 million years after the Big Bang ( that 's 13.1 billion years ago ) and is the youngest such blast to have been spotted — the previous record - beater happened 825 million years after the Big Bang .
NASA 's space - based Swift telescope spotted the burst , named GRB 090423 , on 23 April this year .
" Gamma - ray bursts are rather rare , " says Nial Tanvir of the University of Leicester , UK , who led one of the efforts to characterize the burst .
The Swift telescope spots around 100 a year .
" It 's hard work to pin them down , " he says .
The telescope automatically sent the news back to Earth .
" The spacecraft sends us a text , " says Tanvir .
Once they receive the call from Swift , astronomers must quickly decide whether to follow up the burst with observations from ground - based telescopes .
“ We 're now starting to approach the time when we think the very first galaxies turned on . ” Nial Tanvir

Tanvir 's team used the United Kingdom Infrared Telescope ( UKIRT ) and the Gemini North 8 - metre telescope , both on Hawaii , to track the burst from about 20 minutes after it was first seen .
Strong winds , which can damage the telescope if it is in use , made it too dangerous to use UKIRT for long .
" The weather was pretty bad that night , " says Tanvir .
They then waited until it was night in Chile , where the same team remotely used the Very Large Telescope in the Atacama desert to follow the burst 's afterglow .
Meanwhile , a team led by Ruben Salvaterra at the National Institute for Astrophysics in Merate , Italy used the Telescopio Nazionale Galileo on La Palma in the Canary Islands to watch the burst .
Burst of excitement
Both teams measured the spectrum of the light being received from the γ-ray burst , and both saw the same thing : light below a certain wavelength was missing .
" We saw the light was visible only down to one micrometre ; below that there was no light , " says Salvaterra .
This cut - off is caused by absorption of the light by hydrogen along the line of sight between the object and Earth , suggesting light from the burst had travelled a long way .
The teams were able to use that observation to calculate the light 's ' redshift ' — a measure of how far the light has travelled .
Light stretches out over the time it takes to travel to Earth because the Universe is expanding .
The stretching makes the light appear in the redder end of the electromagnetic spectrum — the bigger the redshift , the farther away the object is .

Light from GRB 090423 had a redshift of 8.2 .
A redshift of around 8 suggests that the light came from the Universe when it was nine times smaller than it is today .
Before this detection , the farthest γ-ray burst seen was at a redshift of 6.7 .
The two latest studies are published in Nature1,2 .
Not only is the burst a record - breaker , but the work also shows that astronomers can effectively probe the early Universe from the ground , says Salvaterra .
" We knew by our models that these kinds of objects should exist , " he says .
" Being one of the people that actually detected it is quite amazing . "
Others in the community are impressed .
" These are spectacular discoveries , and open up unprecedented new windows on the early Universe , " says Edison Liang , an astrophysicist at Rice University in Houston , Texas .
" We 're now starting to approach the time when we think the very first galaxies turned on , " Tanvir adds .
Fueled by previously unappreciated links between climate and ecology , the North Sea has undergone a radical ecological shift in the last half - century , say scientists .
The very shape of the food web has changed , from plankton on up to the cod and flatfish that once dominated the icy waters , supporting rich commercial fisheries .
They 've been largely replaced by jellyfish and crabs .
The full scope of the change has gone relatively unnoticed , and could foreshadow changes in waters around the world .
" Climate - driven changes in the biology of the sea are largely hidden from view , " said Richard Kirby , a University of Plymouth marine biologist and Royal Society Research Fellow .
" If similar changes occurred in a temperate forest , we would be shocked . "
In a study published in the upcoming December Proceedings of the Royal Society B , Kirby and Gregory Beaugrand , an oceanologist at the Lille University of Science and Technology , analyze decades of climate and ecosystem data gathered in the North Sea , a pocket of ocean bordered by the United Kingdom and Scandinavia .
Though relatively small , the North Sea has historically been a fabulously fertile fishing ground .
Even now , it provides about five percent of the global fish harvest — but that 's barely a third of what it yielded just a century ago .
Declining stocks have been blamed almost entirely on overfishing .
However , though fishing pressures have indeed been intense , some scientists have suspected that water temperatures are also a factor .
Over the last quarter - century , the North Sea 's upper layers have warmed by about 2 degrees Fahrenheit .
That seems like little , but in the North Sea , summer and winter water temperatures differ by just a few degrees .
Even a few degrees of change is relatively profound , and enough to disrupt aquatic organisms accustomed to functioning in a very narrow thermal range .
Whether the warming is man-made or not , it 's a sign of times to come .
Global ocean temperatures are expected to experience a comparable or greater rise during the next century .
And the consequences , as anticipated by the North Sea , have been relatively unacknowledged .
Most discussions of climate change impacts focus on the terrestrial .
When ocean life is mentioned , it 's in the context of of coral reef bleaching or acidifying waters .
Both those threats are grave , but the possibility of oceans completely changing their character , independent of acidification or reef effects , may be just as troubling .
" The effect of climate on the marine food web , the way small changes can be amplified through the web , that 's the moral of the story here , " said Kirby .
" And food webs everywhere will be affected in a similar way . "
At the heart of Kirby and Beaugrand 's findings is data from the Continuous Plankton Recorder Survey , which has been run in the North Atlantic since 1931 , when explorer Alister Hardy invented the recorder — a specialized box that 's dragged behind commercial ships , allowing researchers to take sea- wide samples of plankton and juvenile members of other species .
Combined with temperature records , the CPRs provides the most comprehensive climate - ecosystem dataset of any ocean , if not the entire world .
And as temperatures have changed , so has every part of the food web , starting with its foundation .
" If you were to divide zooplankton into those that prefer warmer southern waters , and those that prefer colder northern waters , and look at the boundaries between those groups , it 's moved north by over 700 miles in the last 40 years , " said Kirby .
" That 's one of the largest range shifts , if not the largest , that 's been recorded . "
The distribution of hundreds of species have changed , in every niche from plankton up to the North Sea 's top predators .
Cod and flatfish numbers have plummeted , and tuna have vanished .
The ecological roles they once played are now occupied by jellyfish and bottom - dwelling crabs .
" The North Sea has fundamentally changed .
It 's a totally different ecosystem from what it was , " said Kirby .
When Kirby and Beaugrand crunched the numbers describing these patterns with equations designed to separate cause from coincidence , they found that temperature drove the changes .
They also found evidence for what they call " trophic amplification . "
" Because temperature acts on different components of the food web , the gross effect is amplified , " said Kirby .
" It affects the phytoplankton that copepods feed on ; it affects the copepods ; it affects the predators who eat the copepods ; and all those effects , magnified , are much greater than any one alone . "
This compounding dynamic is responsible for the extreme rapidity of the shift , he added .
" The findings seem plausible to me , " said Marten Scheffer , a Wageningen University ecologist who specializes in ecosystem - wide transitions .
Scheffer , who was not involved in the study , also said that marine shifts are notoriously difficult to study .
" Compared to work on lakes , or terrestrial grazing systems , there is little scope for experimental testing , " he said .
According to Kirby , models by fisheries managers need to incorporate these dynamics and and policymakers contemplating global warming need to consider the magnitude of the change .
A similar dynamic may be at work in the Sea of Japan , which in recent years has become dominated by giant jellyfish .
" Marine ecosystems have always changed , but people do n't realize how responsive they are , and how rapidly they may change , " he said .
" Humans should n't forget that we do n't live in isolation from the food web . "

Microsoft has responded to Apple 's complaint about the software giant 's Laptop Hunters campaign by quietly tweaking at least one of the ads , taking down the old ad from its website and sites like YouTube , and replacing it with a new one .
The only difference is that the new ad no longer mentions specific numbers because Apple recently lowered pricing on its Mac notebooks .
" We slightly adjusted the ads to reflect the updated pricing of the Mac laptop shown in the TV advertisement , " a Microsoft spokesperson told Ars .
" This does not change the focus of the campaign which is to showcase the value and choice of the PC . "
A quick check through all the Laptop Hunters ads on YouTube shows that the fifth one was the only one to be changed out of the six ads .
The edited ad can be viewed in high quality at Microsoft.com / Windows ( Silverlight required ) or in the embedded YouTube video below :
Here 's how the old ad played out .
While in the Mac section , Lauren says : " This Mac is $ 2,000 , and that 's before adding anything . "
Her mother then asks " Why would you pay twice the price ? , " to which Lauren replies " I would n't , " and heads back to the PC section .
In the new ad , when in the Mac section , Lauren simply says " This one only has a 250 GB hard drive .
It seems like you 're paying a lot for the brand . "
Ad Age was first to notice this subtle change .
It appears that Kevin Turner , Microsoft 's Chief Operating Officer , was n't lying when he said last week that Apple 's lawyers called him and demanded that Redmond take down its Laptop Hunter ads .
That part may have been accurate , but we 're still looking into his claim about doing cartwheels down the hallway .

WILLIAMSBURG , Va. , Oct. 25 ( UPI ) -- Students at the College of William & Mary in Virginia have elected a transgender student their homecoming queen for the first time , a school official said .
William & Mary President Taylor Reveley said the homecoming victory by junior Jessee Vasold is not a problem for the public Williamsburg school , which is the second - oldest college in the United States and educated presidents Thomas Jefferson , James Monroe and John Tyler , The Newport News ( Va. ) Daily Press reported Saturday .

" I knew Jessee before , " Reveley said .
" ( It 's ) a little more publicity than normal for a homecoming queen , but it 's just fine . "
Vasold , whose age was not reported , admitted being " surprised " by the homecoming win .
" I knew I was nominated , but I was just surprised , because there were a lot of other really good candidates on the ballot , " Vasold said .
" I know all of the other girls , and they 're wonderful people , really friendly .
So I was surprised . "
The Daily Press said the William & Mary student does not identify with traditional male or female gender roles , instead choosing to approach each day individually .
" Normally , it really just depends on the day , how I dress , " Vasold told the Daily Press .
" I do n't identify as a woman .
It really just depends on the day and the occasion . "
This week , Sheldon could not figure out Howard ’s card trick using math .
But that was fiction .
Playing cards and mathematics go hand in hand .
In real life , Sheldon ’s analysis may well have worked .
How many ways are there to shuffle a deck of cards ?
This question is a classic example of a branch of mathematics called combinatorics .
The first card can be any , or 1 of 52 possibilities .
The second card is more constrained because one card has already been chosen .
So it has 1 of 51 possibilities .
Now suppose you are asking what is the number of ways the first card is what it is AND that the second card is what it is .
In this case AND means multiply the possibilities , so there are 52*51=2,652 different ways to shuffle the first two cards .
Calculating for the rest of the deck is , the combinations are just 52 *51*50*40 *….* 1 . The last card has no choice given that it is the only card left so is a factor of “ 1 ” .
Mathematicians have a shorthand for this result called 52 ! , or 52 factorial .
It is a number so large that even typing it into google wo n’t give all the digits , even though it is far less than a googol .
Instead you can find it on Sheldon ’s board :
The number on Sheldon ’s board .
The number of ways to shuffle a deck of playing cards .
( The last 12 zeroes are not an approximation .
There are five tens in between 1 and 52 .
And the five multiples of 5 always find a multiple of 2 to give another five factors of ten .
Since 25 and 50 contribute two extra factors of 5 that find factors of 2 , that is why there are 12 zeroes at the end . )
More compactly , this is 8*1067 .
Or in plain English , the number is “ 80 unvigintillion ” .
The British have a different word for it , “ 80 undecillion ” but they do n’t even get “ a billion ” right .
The Brits traditionally call a “ trillion ” a “ billion ” because they skip over “ billion ” as a “ thousand million ” .
Since they do n’t call a million a “ thousand thousand ” , consistency is apparently not their strong suit .
( To be fair , the UK switched from this so - called “ long - scale ” naming convention to the “ short scale ” one used by the US and others in 1974 , but the long scale persists in some countries .
And to think they scoff at Americans for not using the metric system . )
In any language it is still a large number .
Even if every one of the 7 billion men , women , and children on Earth played one billion card games every year for a billion years , they would not even make a dent in the number of possible shuffled decks of cards .
We may well ask a different question .
Has there likely ever been two games played from the same shuffled deck ?
That is a different exercise in combinatorics .
The chance is much higher .
The answer is not just the number of games ever played divided by that big number .
An example of this effect is the classic question : “ What is the chance that in a room of 23 people , two have the same birthday ? ”
You might naively guess 23/365 or 6 % .
But it turns out to be greater than a 50 % chance .
Among 57 people , there is a 99 % chance that two have the same birthday .
Since twins sometimes hang out together and other correlations may be found , the real chance is much higher , but we are assuming everyone ’s birthday in the room is independent .
If a 5o % chance seems surprisingly large for one pair among 23 people to have the same birthday , remember we have n’t chosen which day .
We are not asking the chance they have your birthday or Britney ’s birthday , but that any pair has the same birthday , no matter what day .
Luckily , the same question can be asked a more illuminating , way :
What is the probability that nobody in the group has the same birthday as each another ?
If there is 50 % chance that none have the same birthday , then there is a 50 % some pair does .
Phrased the second way , the odds are more easily calculated .
The first person has a no chance of matching on his own with anyone else .
The second still has 364 out of 365 chances of not matching .
The third has 363 chances in 365 .
And so on .
Multiplying these 23 factors :
( 365/365 ) * ( 364/365 ) * ( 363/365 ) * ( 362/365 ) * ( 361/365 ) * ( 360/365 ) * ( 359/365 ) * ( 358/365 ) * ( 357/365 ) * ( 356/365 ) * ( 355/365 ) * ( 354/365 ) * ( 353/365 ) * ( 352/365 ) * ( 351/365 ) * ( 350/365 ) * ( 349/365 ) * ( 348/365 ) * ( 347/365 ) * ( 346/365 ) * ( 345/365 ) * ( 344/365 ) * ( 343/365 ) = 0.49
That is a 49 % chance no pair has the same birthday .
And hence , 51 % do .
( The occasional presence of February 29 , would not change our result much and I ignored the five million people born on that day . )
So back to our problem of what is the chance that no two card games have ever started with the same deck .
I ’ll start with assumption that every deck was well enough shuffled that they were all independent .
Given the number of drunk poker players and the fact that every purchased new deck starts out the same , I know this is a poor assumption .
Repeating the birthday calculation for decks of cards — using the big number above — is left for an exercise for the comments .
Martin Gardner wrote an article every month about “ recreational mathematics ” ( Yes , there is such a thing ) for the popular magazine Scientific American .
Mathematics of card tricks was an expertise of Gardner , just as Sheldon was reckoning on the white boards .
Many tricks were published in his 1956 book Mathematics , Magic and Mystery .
Here ’s one of Martin Gardner ’s simpler card tricks based on mathematics that you can now use to amaze and entertain your friends for hours .
Start with The Cyclic Number trick , which Gardner attributes to Mr. Lloyd Jones of Oakland California ( 1942 ) .
Give your spectator five red cards : 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 , and 6 .
Keep for yourself six black cards : A , 4 , 2,8 , 5 , 7 .
The magician deals out his cards in a row and has his spectator write down the number : 142857 .
The player picks one of his cards , say 5 , and multiplies the two on a sheet of paper giving in this case 714285 .
The magician picks up his cards , gives a quick cut and lo and behold , deals out the six cards in order corresponding to the spectator ’s multiplication : 714285 .
The trick rests on the fact that the number 142857 is cyclic .
Multiply it by any number and the result will be the same numbers , in the same order .
What else would you expect the reciprocal of a prime number , in this case seven , to do ?
Math ( and a little dexterity faking the cuts and shuffles ) is all you need .
Using the mathematical structure of a deck ( 4 suits , 13 types of cards ) leads to a variety of more complex games , including modular arithmetic which was the reason for “ mod 4 ” and “ mod 13 ” on the boards .
Pick up Gardner ’s book and enjoy .

Good news for procrastinating students : a nasal spray developed by a team of German scientists promises to give late night cram sessions a major boost , if a good night 's sleep follows .
In a research report featured as the cover story of the October 2009 print issue of The FASEB Journal , these scientists show that a molecule from the body 's immune system ( interleukin - 6 ) when administered through the nose helps the brain retain emotional and procedural memories during REM sleep .
" Sleep to remember , a dream or reality ? " said Lisa Marshall , co-author of the study , from the Department of Neuroendocrinology at the University of Lubeck in Germany .
" Here , we provide the first evidence that the immunoregulatory signal interleukin - 6 plays a beneficial role in sleep - dependent formation of long - term memory in humans . "
To make this discovery , Marshall and colleagues had 17 healthy young men spend two nights in the laboratory .
On each night after reading either an emotional or neutral short story , they sprayed a fluid into their nostrils which contained either interleukin - 6 or a placebo fluid .
The subsequent sleep and brain electric activity was monitored throughout the night .
The next morning subjects wrote down as many words as they could remember from each of the two stories .
Those who received the dose of IL - 6 could remember more words .
" If a nasal spray can improve memory , perhaps we 're on our way to giving some folks a whiff of common sense , such as accepting the realities of evolution , " said Gerald Weissmann , M.D. , Editor - in - Chief of The FASEB Journal .
" This is exciting piece of interdisciplinary science , since IL - 6 had previously been considered a by - product of inflammation , not an agent that affects cognition . "
The debate regarding the American " obesity plague " has taken on an increasingly rancorous tone .
On one side are those who honestly believe that we cannot repair our imperiled health - care system without addressing the enormous strains placed on that system by the seriously overweight .
On the other side are those of a Rubenesque stature who are enraged that they are routinely the targets of catcalls , epithets and even job discrimination , and who have had it up to here with the fatty jokes .
Lost in all this is an appreciation ...
Hitchens writes on the difference between the evils of atheism and the evils of religion : " Humanism has many crimes for which to apologise .
But it can apologise for them , and also correct them , in its own terms and without having to shake or challenge the basis of any unalterable system of belief .
Totalitarian systems , whatever outward form they may take , are fundamentalist and , as we would now say , ' faith - based ' . "
He also invites us to consider the responses of religious organisations to the totalitarian regimes of the last century , pointing to the Catholic Church 's support of Mussolini and its apparently passive stance in regard to the Nazi regime 's persecution of the Jewish people .
While Stalin was indisputably an atheist ( though at the behest of his mother he trained for the priesthood at a Russian Orthodox seminary ) , there is some room for debate about Hitler 's beliefs .
Both were indisputably evil men .
The important question is : were they evil because of their atheism ?
As Dawkins points out , there is not the smallest evidence that atheism systematically influences people to do bad things .
And if we want to compare degrees of evil , it is important to distinguish evil intent from the means available to bring that intent to fruition .
Science and technology are , of themselves , morally neutral tools that can be double - edged swords .
Modern biology has given us biological weapons , but it has also given us modern medicine .
The impact of Hitler 's evil was made all the worse by his control over the technological apparatus of a modern industrialised state .
Abramovich is clearly worried that the new atheists may not share the supposedly high moral standards of religious people .
He refers to the 20th century as an " experiment in secularism . . . responsible for the unprecedented murder of more than 100 million " , citing Hitler and Stalin as examples of the worst that atheism and secularism have produced .
In another shot across Dawkins ' bows , he accuses Dawkins of being ' mute on the terrors unleashed by science and technology " , such as nuclear and biological weapons .
Obviously , not everybody is religious .
If we do have a predisposition towards religious belief , then it seems it is possible to overcome it by learning to think critically .
It is no accident that a large percentage of the highest - achieving scientists are either atheists or claim a belief in Einstein 's remote kind of God .
The way that science is taught and practised emphasises a particular form of critical thinking , in an atmosphere where all claims are judged on the strength of the available evidence .
If religion is false , why do so many people follow it ?
Scientists such as Dawkins have a few ideas about that .
The human brain has evolved over millions of years to be well adapted for dealing with and surviving the challenges thrown up by the kinds of environments in which human beings live .
It has been suggested that the same adaptations that have contributed to humanity 's success as a species have also , as a side effect , predisposed us towards accepting certain kinds of mystical and religious beliefs .
Our brains may well be " hard - wired ' for religion .
Add some cultural nurture to our evolved nature and we have the beginnings of an explanation for why so many people follow some form of religion .
When it comes to choosing one particular religion over another , it seems to be largely a matter of indoctrination ; the best predictor of a person 's religious beliefs is the beliefs held by his or her parents .
Abramovich turns to the benefits of religion , pointing out that there are " millions who every day selflessly dedicate their lives to helping others all in the name of religious belief " .
There are , of course , many secular organisations whose members also dedicate their lives to helping others , and many individual atheists who do so independently , not in the name of religious belief , but simply because they believe it is the morally right thing to do .
The argument that morality requires religion or even the existence of God has been discussed extensively by philosophers from Plato onward ; there is too little space to discuss the issue here .
Suffice it to say that secular humanism is a well - developed and self - consistent moral system that makes no reference to God or religion , while duplicating many of the more admirable moral precepts of established religions and improving on the less admirable ones .
Our Australian system of government and the laws of the land owe as much ( or more ) to this secular system of morality as they do to the Christian religion .
Moderate religious people , in contrast to the fundamentalists , tell us that the foundational texts of the great monotheistic faiths should not always be taken literally ; they must be appropriately interpreted .
But how are we are to decide which parts of the Torah or the Bible or the Koran are to be taken as the inflexible Word of God and which parts can safely be ignored or reinterpreted ?
In matters of morality – take intolerance of homosexuality , for example – people nominally of the same religion often bitterly disagree about the " right " way to interpret God 's word .
Many Westerners today hold idiosyncratic and not - always - internally - consistent sets of beliefs made up of a hodge - podge of elements borrowed from many disparate religious traditions , often with a few " new - age " ideas thrown in .
Secular humanists argue that it is better to base decisions about moral principles on reasoned arguments rather than on appeals to perceived authorities or accepted dogma or particular interpretations of the word of God .
Texts such as the Bible are not primarily concerned with moral teachings anyway .
The most important message of the Bible , judging from the number of words devoted to it , is that it is vitally important to believe in the correct God .
Abramovich hails religion for inspiring great works of art such as Michelangelo 's paintings in the Sistine Chapel .
One response to this is to point to all the great works of art that do not have religious themes .
Another is simply to wonder what might have been : what works of art might a Michelangelo or a Bach have produced had they been inspired by and commissioned to explore themes other than religious ones ?
There 's no reason to suppose that their oeuvres would have been any the less impressive .
Abramovich seems to believe that without religion there can be no sense of wonder or the numinous , such as might inspire an artist like Michelangelo .
He writes that mere " atoms in motion " can't explain the " dignity of the human spirit , sorrow , beauty , love " and so on .
This is the " god of the gaps " argument again .
A prosaic response is to point out that the sciences , such as evolutionary psychology , are in fact making some progress in explaining things like love and the dignity of the human spirit .
This is another instance where science does not yet have all the answers , but that 's all right .
Scientists are comfortable with uncertainty – even excited by it , since it holds the promise of discovery and new understanding .
A more emotional response is to point out that human feelings such as belonging , loving and being loved , being part of something bigger than oneself , can and do exist in the absence of any belief in God or religion .
Atheists report those feelings and perceptions in much the same way that religious people do .
The only difference is that where a devoutly religious person may feel to the core of his being that he is part of God 's creation , an atheist may feel equally intensely that he is part of a complex universe entirely explainable by natural laws .
Dawkins remarks that the human brain is a " design nightmare " .
His point , apparently missed by Abramovich , is that the brain was n't purposefully designed at all .
No intelligent designer would have designed it the way it is .
We have a beautiful and powerful explanation for why the brain is the way it is : the theory of evolution .
The human brain evolved over millions of years , by the sometimes - haphazard process of random variation acted on by the emphatically non-random process of natural selection .
A deep understanding of the surprising and amazingly - unlikely series of steps that led to the emergence of human brains and the humans that came along with them , inspires in the educated atheist a sense of awe similar to that which religious people must feel when they contemplate God .
Family members of a victim killed in one of two suicide bombings Sunday grieve at his funeral in Baghdad on Monday .
At least 155 people died and about 500 were wounded when two bombs went off near government buildings .
(( Karim Kadim / Associated Press ) )
Iraqi security forces reinforced checkpoints and guarded government buildings Monday , the day after two suicide bombings in the heart of Baghdad killed more than 150 people , the worst attacks in the country in more than two years .
Officials raised the death toll from Sunday 's blasts to 155 , including 24 children on a bus leaving a daycare near the Justice Ministry .
Officials said the explosions of two vehicles also wounded about 500 people , and warned that intelligence suggests other government buildings might be targets of future attacks .
The blasts , near the city 's heavily fortified Green Zone administrative district , cast doubt on the ability of the government to ensure the safety of its citizens , and raised fears that such mayhem will only increase as Iraq prepares for crucial elections in January .
" This explosion made people furious , " said Ahmed Hassan , an employee at the Ministry of Education .
" People will not re-elect this government . "
" Today , we came to work despite the fear inside us , " said Siham Abdul - Karim , an employee of the Culture Ministry located near the site of the bombings and surrounded by police checkpoints on Monday .
" We all wonder how could car bombs reach these institutions . "
Attackers aim to ' spread chaos , ' PM says
The attacks occurred just hours before Iraq 's top leadership was scheduled to meet with heads of political parties to seek a compromise on election guidelines for the January vote .
Iraqi Prime Minister Nouri al - Maliki blamed the bombings on al - Qaeda and loyalists of former dictator Saddam Hussein , who he said want to " spread chaos in the country , undermine the political process and prevent the holding of parliamentary elections . "
No groups have claimed responsibility for the blasts .

It was the bloodiest attack in the capital in over two years .
( ( Reuters ) )
Investigators were attempting to piece together how two vehicles packed with explosives were able to pass through security checkpoints on the way to two government buildings , the Baghdad Provincial Administration building and the Justice Ministry .
Maj. - Gen. Qassim al - Mousawi , a spokesman for the city 's operations command centre , said the first vehicle , a 26 - seat bus , was carrying 1,000 kilograms of explosives , while the second vehicle , a minibus which blew up near the Baghdad Provincial Administration building , was carrying 700 kilograms of explosives .
Interior Minister Jawad al - Bolani said 76 people have been arrested so far , but did not provide information on who they were or how they were believed to be connected to the bombings .
The bombings were the deadliest attacks in the country since a series of massive truck bombs killed 500 villagers in northern Iraq in August 2007 .
Sunday 's death toll was the worst in Baghdad since April 2007 , when a series of suicide bombings against Shia neighbourhoods killed 183 .
Also on Monday , Iraqi security officials said a car bomb at a police checkpoint near the city of Karbala in southern Iraq killed at least four people .

Colum McCann
Wins the NBA for " Let the Great World Spin "
Cheers to Colum McCann for winning the National Book Award last night for his novel " Let the Great World Spin !
" The book is about when Philip Petit stretched a tightrope between the World Trade Center towers and then danced across it in 1974 .
It 's about the lives of New Yorkers at the time and how they intersected -- their relations to each other along social and class divides .
Petit 's journey between the towers was called " the artistic crime of the century " by Time Magazine : a crime so artistic that even mere books about it are winning the big prizes .
" Now I worry about Colum McCann , " said Frank McCourt about this book before he died .
" What is he going to do after this blockbuster groundbreaking symphony of a novel ?
No novelist writing of New York has climbed higher , dived deeper .
" THE BOOK ITSELF IS LIKE STRETCHING A WIRE BETWEEN THE WORLD'S HIGHEST TOWERS AND DOING BACKFLIPS ON IT !
From Wikipedia , about Philip Petit : " Petit was first inspired to attempt what he called his " coup " on the Twin Towers while he sat in his dentist 's office in Paris in 1968 .
In a magazine , he came upon an article about the as - yet - unconstructed buildings , along with an illustration of the model .
He became obsessed with the towers , collecting articles on them whenever possible . "
" Petit was warned by his friend on the South Tower that a police helicopter would come to pick him off the wire unless he got off .
Rain had begun to fall , and Petit decided he had taken enough risks , so he decided to give himself up to the police waiting for him on the South Tower .
He was arrested once he stepped off the wire .
Provoked by his taunting behaviour while on the wire , police handcuffed him behind his back and roughly pushed him down a flight of stairs .
This he later described as the most dangerous part of the stunt . "
" His audacious high wire performance made headlines around the world .
When asked why he did the stunt , Petit would say " When I see three oranges , I juggle ; when I see two towers , I walk .
" Here 's McCann in some bar , talking about lit ( keep watching until you can separate his voice from the crowd for a fun object lesson about being a writer ) :
Go buy his book , if you have money and like to read .
He 'd read YOUR book .
If it was good .
Can things get still worse in Washington ?
Yes , they can .
And they will , if the Supreme Court decides for corporations and against real human beings and their democracy in a case the Court will be hearing today , Citizens United v. Federal Election Commission .
Until reaching the Supreme Court last year , this case has involved a narrow issue about whether an anti-Hillary Clinton movie made in the heat of the last presidential election is covered by restrictions in the McCain - Feingold campaign finance law .
However , in a highly unusual move announced on the last day of the Supreme Court 's 2008 term , the justices announced they wanted to reconsider two other pivotal decisions that limit the role of corporate money in politics .
The Court ordered a special oral argument on the issue , before the full start of their 2009 term in October .
The Court will today hear argument on whether prior decisions blocking corporations from spending their money on " independent expenditures " for electoral candidates should be overturned .
" Independent expenditures " are funds spent without coordination with a candidate 's campaign .
The rationale for such a move would be that existing rules interfere with corporations '
First Amendment rights to free speech .
Overturning the court 's precedents on corporate election expenditures would be nothing short of a disaster .
Corporations already dominate our political process -- through political action committees , fundraisers , high - paid lobbyists and personal contributions by corporate insiders , often bundled together to increase their impact , threats to move jobs abroad and more .
On the dominant issues of the day -- climate change , health care and financial regulation -- corporate interests are leveraging their political investments to sidetrack vital measures to protect the planet , expand health care coverage while controlling costs , and prevent future financial meltdowns .
The current system demands reform to limit corporate influence .
Public funding of elections is the obvious and necessary ( though very partial ) first step .
Yet the Supreme Court may actually roll back the limits on corporate electoral spending now in place .
These limits are very inadequate , but they do block unlimited spending from corporate treasuries to influence election outcomes .
Rolling back those limits will unleash corporations to ramp up their spending still further , with a potentially decisive chilling effect on candidates critical of the Chamber of Commerce agenda .

The damage will be double , because a Court ruling on constitutional grounds would effectively overturn the laws in place in two dozen states similarly barring corporate expenditures on elections .
More than 100 years ago , reacting to what many now call the First Gilded Age , Congress acted to prohibit direct corporate donations to electoral candidates .
Corporate expenditures in electoral races have been prohibited for more than 60 years .
These rules reflected the not -very - controversial observation that for - profit corporations have a unique ability to gather enormous funds and that expenditures from the corporate treasury are certain to undermine democracy - understood to mean rule by the people .
Real human beings , not corporations .
In arguing to uphold the existing corporate expenditure restrictions , the Federal Election Commission has emphasized these common sense observations .
" For - profit corporations have attributes that no natural person shares , " the FEC argues .
Noting that corporations are state - created -- not natural entities -- the FEC explains that " for - profit corporations are inherently more likely than individuals to engage in electioneering behavior that poses a risk of actual or apparent corruption of office - holders . "
The FEC also notes that corporate spending on elections does not reflect the views of a company 's owners ( shareholders ) .
Although the signs are n't good , there is no certainty how the Court will decide Citizens United .
There is some hope that the Court will decide that it is inappropriate to roll back such longstanding and important campaign finance rules , in a case where the issue was not presented in the lower courts , and where the litigants ' dispute can be decided on much narrower grounds .
Public Citizen is organizing people to protest against a roll back of existing restrictions on corporate campaign expenditures .
To join the effort , go to www.dontgetrolled.org.
People are pledging to protest in diverse ways -- from street actions to letter writing -- today , and in the event of a bad decision , and also networking for solutions to corporate - corrupted elections .
Ours is a government of the people , by the people , for the people -- not the corporations and their money .
Corporations do n't vote , and they should n't be permitted to spend limitless amounts of money to influence election outcomes .
Robert Weissman is president of Public Citizen .
Public Citizen attorney Scott Nelson serves as counsel to the original sponsors of the McCain - Feingold law , who have filed an amicus brief in the case , asking that existing restrictions on corporate election expenditures be maintained .
Washington ( CNN ) --
A prison in northern Illinois is the leading contender to house some detainees transferred from the federal facility in Guantanamo Bay , Cuba , two Obama administration officials told CNN Saturday .
Officials from the department of Defense , Justice and Homeland Security and federal Bureau of Prisons will be will be visiting the maximum - security Thomson Correctional Center , about 150 miles west of Chicago , on Monday , the officials said .
Earlier Saturday , a statement from Illinois Gov. Pat Quinn 's office said senior Obama administration officials would be visiting the Thomson prison to see whether the " virtually vacant , state of the art facility " could be of use to the Bureau of Prisons .
The statement did n't mention the space possibly being utilized for Guantanamo detainees , but said that overcrowding is a " serious issue and one of the reasons why the Bureau of Prisons is interested in viewing Thomson Correction Center . "
Quinn , whose administration hopes to generate jobs and economic growth in Thomson through the prison , was scheduled to speak on the visit Monday .
If the Bureau of Prisons purchases the 1,600 - cell site , it would operate primarily as a federal prison and lease a portion of it to the Defense Department to house a limited number of Guantanamo detainees , one Obama administration official said .
There are about 215 men held by the U.S. military at the Guantanamo prison camp .
Among the detainees are five suspects with alleged ties to the 9/11 conspiracy , including accused mastermind Khalid Sheikh Mohammed , who will be transferred to New York to go on trial in civilian court , Attorney General Eric Holder announced Friday .
As part of the conversion at Thomson , the same Obama official added , the Bureau of Prisons and Defense Department would enhance security measures to exceed those of the nation 's only supermax prison -- the U.S. Penitentiary Administrative Maximum Facility in Florence , Colorado .
No inmate has ever escaped from the prison .
The likelihood of Thomson being tapped to house Guantanamo detainees was first reported by the Chicago Tribune on Saturday , and sparked immediate concern from critics of the Obama administration .
U.S. Rep. Mark Kirk , R - Illinois , whose district covers suburban Chicago , circulated a letter addressed to President Obama to Illinois leaders Saturday , opposing the possible transfer of detainees .
The letter says that doing so would turn metropolitan Chicago into " ground zero for Jihadist terrorist plots , recruitment and radicalization . "
As home to Chicago 's Willis ( formerly Sears ) Tower -- the nation 's tallest building -- " we should not invite Al Qaeda to make Illinois its number one target , " said the statement by Kirk , who is running for the same Senate seat once held by Obama .
" The United States spent more than $ 50 million to build the Guantanamo Bay detention facility to keep terrorists away from U.S. soil .
Al Qaeda terrorists should stay where they cannot endanger American citizens . "
The Obama administration has vowed to close the Guantanamo facility , but acknowledges it is unlikely to happen by its self - imposed January 22 , 2010 , deadline .
However , one of the two Obama administration officials speaking to CNN Saturday said that , coupled with the announced transfer of the alleged 9/11 conspirator , the likely developments at the Thomson prison are " good progress " toward closing the Guantanamo site .
The federal prison system currently houses approximately 340 inmates linked to international terrorism , including more than 200 tied to international incidents , the other Obama official said .
Of the total number , 35 inmates are housed in federal prisons in Illinois , including Ali al - Marri , who pleaded guilty in federal court to conspiring to provide material support to al Qaeda .
Al - Marri is serving eight years and four months at the federal penitentiary in Marion , Illinois .
While at our last denominational meeting , I made the offer to the pastors of my denomination that if they needed investment advice , they could contact me for advice . �
Out of eighty or so pastors that that could have asked for advice , one e-mailed me .�
( The pastors and elders did elect me to the pension board , to help manage the relationships with the defined contribution fund managers .�
I ’ll do my best for them . )
The pastor is young - ish , with a wife and six kids . �
He had 60 % invested in a broad bond fund which had a high exposure to investment grade corporates and high yield ( and AAA CMBS ) , and 40 % in a stable value fund .
This is a redacted version of what I wrote to him :
You ’ve been playing it conservatively .�
At this point conservative is good .�
If I were not tardy in responding to you ( my apologies ) , I might have suggested taking a little more risk at the time when you wrote .
This is the way that I view asset allocation : � look at the risk factors in the investment markets , and look at the funding needs of the person or institution that owns the assets .�
( I.e. , so what are we saving for ? )
Most people do n’t save enough .�
The $ 4000 per year is good , but most people need to put more of a buffer aside than that , whether in IRAs ( for retirement ) or in a taxable account ( for emergencies , future coollege aid to children , etc. ) �
You have six little liabilities that may need some help starting out as they reach adulthood .�
Consider saving more .
Now for the risk factors :
Equities — somewhat overvalued at present .� ( US and foreign )
Credit —
Investment grade credit is slightly overvalued , and high yield is overvalued .
Real Estate — the future stream of mortgage payments that need to be made is high relative to the present value of properties .�
There will be more defaults , both in commercial and residential .
Yield Curve — Steep .�
It is reasonable to lend long , so long as inflation does not take off .
Inflation — Low , but future inflation is probably underestimated .
Foreign currency —
One of my rules of thumb is that when there is not much compensation offered for risk in the US , it is time to look abroad , particularly at foreign fixed income .
Commodities — the global economy is not running that hot now . �
There will be pressures on resources in the future , but that seems to be a way off .
Volatility is underpriced — most have assumed a simple V - shaped rebound but there are a lot of problems left to solve .
What this leads me to is this : I do n’t know all of the bond and stock funds you can use at present , though I will after the next pension board meeting .�
The bond fund you are using was a great play over the last 9 months , but is probably overvalued now . �
If there is a more conservative bond fund , you might want to shift some funds there .�
If not , use the fixed fund . �
I do n’t think we have an international bond fund , or an inflation protected fund �available , but if we do I would add some there .
On a pullback in the stock markets , I would look to add some stock into the mix . �
I would add some with the market 10 % lower , and would add considerably with the market 30 % lower . �
If there are international stock funds , I would use them 30/70 with US funds .
Consider this a start of a discussion .�
I ’m not bullish on much right now . �
This is a time to preserve capital , not make returns . �
Let me know what you think , and sorry for being so slow to get back to you .
If I were talking to an institutional investor , I would have added illiquidity as a risk factor , which I think is fairly priced right now .
I might have also added that I would be bullish on GSE - sponsored mortgage bonds and carefully selected CMBS .
Aside from that , I was pleasantly surprised in Barron ’s to see Mark Taborsky of Pimco thinking about asset allocation the way I do .�
There is no generic risk .�
There are many risks .�
Are you getting fair compensation for the risks that you are taking ?�
If not , invest in other risks , or if there are few risks worth taking , invest in cash , TIPS , or foreign fixed income .
not prologue , and , asset allocation is not a free lunch .�
With so many people following strategic asset allocation , assets have separated into two groups , safe and risky .
Modern Portfolio
Theory has done everyone a gross disservice .�
It is not as if we can predict the future , but the use of historical values for average returns , standard deviations , and correlations lead us astray . �
These figures are not stable in the intermediate term . �
The past isprologue , and unlike what Sallie Krawcheck said in Barron ’s , asset allocation is not a free lunch .�
With so many people following strategic asset allocation , assets have separated into two groups , safe and risky .
To this end , it is better to think in terms of risk factors rather than some generic formulation of risk .�
Ask yourself , am I getting paid to bear this risk ?�
Look to the risks that offer the best compensation , and avoid those that offer little or negative compensation .

Kritik von Datenschützern Daimler verlangt Blutproben von Bewerbern
In der deutschen Wirtschaft bahnt sich offenbar ein neuer Datenskandal an - diesmal bei Daimler .
Der Autokonzern verlangt nach NDR - Informationen Blutproben von Stellenbewerbern .
Arbeitsrechtler und Datenschützer sind empört , das Unternehmen weist die Vorwürfe zurück .
It was no idle boast when Mission Motors claimed that its Mission One all - electric motorcycle could reach 150 MPH speeds .
In fact , the company 's showing in the 2009 BUB Motorcycle Speed Trials at the Bonneville Salt Flats in Utah has proved all this and more , with the bike hitting single pass speeds as high as 161 MPH , and a two - pass average of 150.059 MPH , setting the Land Speed Record for Electric Motorcycles in the process .
And this is n't a vehicle that taunts you , forever unavailable , like Evel Knievel 's rocket - powered cycle .
No , this is a production prototype featuring the same powertrain that customers can look forward to shelling out close to $ 70,000 for when it becomes available sometime next year .
But do n't take our word for it , peep the video for yourself after the break .

This year I had a information retrieval course .
I ’m not a fanboy of Haskell or functional programming , and when the time came to write a program given short time I decided I ’ll do better with Python .
I know the language pretty well and did some text processing in it before .
There were some significant advantages of choosing Python .
For one thing , it handles strings pretty well : there are good ( read : written in C ) procedures that are well designed and suitable for many types of processing .
Well … turns out not that many .
Pretty quickly I had to resort to using regular expressions , which may be fast , but felt like an overkill .
In theory I knew all the pieces that would compose into my program .
The problem of putting them together should n’t be too hard – and it was n’t .
The problem was to get this thing working on my machine with workload intended .
Enter garbage collector nightmare .
Turns out Python ( or at least CPython , I did n’t try the others ) has a serious problems with it .
A program that should do well with constant memory after while can start swapping like mad – and in practice , never finish the job .
I ’ve lost countless hours trying to pin down the bugs in my code that led to this .
I still wonder where they are – and whether they are really fell on my part .
I doubt it know .
I wrote a lot of code that should solve the problem many times , if there was a problem in my code .
I ended up writing all the code in the way they I could do the batch processing .
Then I had to write additional code to merge the results .
Lots and lots of boilerplate code ( with it ’s own share of bugs to smash ) .
I was pretty frustrated and out of schedule .
The final product was below my expectations , in terms of both functionalities and code quality , which surely found it way into the final score for the course .
Now you can tell me : it ’s always the same story : too little time , too much to do , hidden problems I did n’t foresee .
So I ’ll tell you about my experience with Haskell .
Some time later I had to expand my previous task .
While I had most of the code in place , it was a complete mess .
I designed it to be one , 500 - lines at maximum script .
I ended up with 1200 lines of code .
So I decided to start from scratch with Haskell .
It was refreshing : GC worked well , Binary works much better then Python ’s Pickle ( yes , I did use the C version … ) , and in overall I could easily reuse most of the code .
All in all , the resulting code worked much better and had fewer bugs .
I also spend half of the time , and did n’t have any unpleasant discoveries .
Haskell has it ’s own set of pitfalls and shortcomings .
But then , every useful programming language has them .
The real question is : where are the limits of what can easily be done with it ?
I have n’t answered this question for Haskell – yet .
But clearly Haskell allows you more than Python .

The Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) and The New World Order
- By William Blase
For those who may be confused by the controversies surrounding the " New World Order " , a One - World - Government , and American concern over giving the UN more power ; those unaware of the issues involved ; and those wishing more background , I offer the following .
Originally presented for an Honors Class , " Dilemmas of War and Peace , " at New Mexico State University , the paper was ridiculed and characterized by Dr. Yosef Lapid , ( an acknowledged and locally quoted " expert " on Terrorism and Middle Eastern affairs ) as " paranoid ... possibly a symptom of mental illness . "
You may judge for yourself .
Citing source data is the " scientific method , " but does not seem to apply to " Conspiracy Theories . "
A thousand sources may be quoted , yet will not convince the " skeptics , " the " realists . "
It seems to me the " symptoms of mental illness " are on their side , if they refuse to look at evidence ( " There are none so blind as those who WILL not see " ) ; or perhaps something more sinister is at work , such as a knowledge of the truth , that does not want YOU to know .
To be paranoid means to believe in delusions of danger and persecution .
If the danger is real , and the evidence credible , then it can not be delusional .
To ignore the evidence , and hope that it CANNOT be true , is more an evidence of mental illness .
The issue involves much more than a difference of philosophy , or political viewpoint .
Growing up in the midst of the " Cold War , " our generation were taught that those who attempted to abolish our national sovereignty and overthrow our Constitutional government were committing acts of treason .
Please judge for yourself if the group discussed is guilty of such .
If one group is effectively in control of national governments and multinational corporations ; promotes world government through control of media , foundation grants , and education ; and controls and guides the issues of the day ; then they control most options available .
The Council on Foreign Relations ( CFR ) , and the financial powers behind it , have done all these things , and promote the " New World Order " , as they have for over seventy years .
The CFR is the promotional arm of the Ruling Elite in the United States of America .
Most influential politicians , academics and media personalities are members , and it uses its influence to infiltrate the New World Order into American life .
Its ' " experts " write scholarly pieces to be used in decision making , the academics expound on the wisdom of a united world , and the media members disseminate the message .
To understand how the most influential people in America came to be members of an organization working purposefully for the overthrow of the Constitution and American sovereignty , we have to go back at least to the early 1900's , though the story begins much earlier ( depending on your viewpoint and beliefs ) .
That a ruling power elite does indeed control the U.S. government behind the scenes has been attested to by many americans in a position to know .
Felix Frankfurter , Justice of the Supreme Court ( 1939 - 1962 ) , said : " The real rulers in Washington are invisible and exercise power from behind the scenes . "
In a letter to an associate dated November 21 , 1933 , President Franklin Roosevelt wrote , " The real truth of the matter is , as you and I know , that a financial element in the large centers has owned the government ever since the days of Andrew Jackson . "
February 23 , 1954 ,
Senator William Jenner warned in a speech : " Outwardly we have a Constitutional government .
We have operating within our government and political system , another body representing another form of government , a bureaucratic elite which believes our Constitution is outmoded . "
Baron M.A. Rothschild wrote , " Give me control over a nation 's currency and I care not who makes its laws . "
All that is needed to effectively control a government is to have control over the nation 's money : a central bank with a monopoly over the supply of money and credit .
This had been done in Western Europe , with the creation of privately owned central banks such as the Bank of England .
Georgetown professor Dr. Carroll Quigley ( Bill Clinton 's mentor while at Georgetown ) wrote about the goals of the investment bankers who control central banks : " ... nothing less than to create a world system of financial control in private hands able to dominate the political system of each country and the economy of the world as a whole ... controlled in a feudalist fashion by the central banks of the world acting in concert , by secret agreements arrived at in frequent private meetings and conferences . "
The Bank of the United States ( 1816 - 36 ) , an early attempt at an American central bank , was abolished by President Andrew Jackson , who believed that it threatened the nation .
He wrote : " The bold effort the present bank had made to control the government , the distress it had wantonly produced ... are but premonitions of the fate that awaits the American people should they be deluded into a perpetuation of this institution or the establishment of another like it . "
Thomas Jefferson wrote : " The Central Bank is an institution of the most deadly hostility existing against the principles and form of our Constitution ... if the American people allow private banks to control the issuance of their currency , first by inflation and then by deflation , the banks and corporations that will grow up around them will deprive the people of all their property until their children will wake up homeless on the continent their fathers conquered . "
Does that not describe the situation in America today ?
The U.S. managed to do without a central bank until early in this century , when , according to Congressman Charles Lindbergh , Sr. , " The Money Trust caused the 1907 panic , and thereby forced Congress to create a National Monetary Commission . "
Headed by Senator Nelson Aldrich , father - in - law of John D. Rockefeller , Jr. , the Commission recommended creation of a central bank .
Though unconstitutional , as only " The Congress shall have Power ... To coin Money , regulate the Value thereof ... " ( Article I , Section 8 , U.S. Constitution ) the Federal Reserve Act was passed in December 1913 ; ostensibly to stabilize the economy and prevent further panics , but as Lindberg warned Congress : " This act establishes the most gigantic trust on earth ... the invisible government by the money power , proven to exist by the Money Trust investigation , will be legalized . "
The Great Depression and numerous recessions later , it is obvious the Federal Reserve produces inflation and federal debt whenever it desires , but not stability .
Congressman Louis McFadden , House Committee on Banking and Currency Chairman ( 1920 - 31 ) , stated : " When the Federal Reserve Act was passed , the people of these United States did not perceive that a world banking system was being set up here .
A super - state controlled by international bankers and industrialists ... acting together to enslave the world ...
Every effort has been made by the Fed to conceal its powers but the truth is -- the Fed has usurped the government . "
Although called " Federal , " the Federal Reserve system is privately owned by member banks , makes its own policies , and is not subject to oversight by Congress or the President .
As the overseer and supplier of reserves , the Fed gave banks access to public funds , which enhanced their lending capacity .
Peter Kershaw , in " Economic Solutions " lists the ten major shareholders of the Federal Reserve Bank System as : Rothschild : London and Berlin ; Lazard Bros : Paris ; Israel Seiff : Italy ; Kuhn - Loeb Company : Germany ; Warburg : Hamburg and Amsterdam ; Lehman Bros : New York ; Goldman and Sachs : New York ; Rockefeller : New York .
( That most , if not all of these families just happen to be Jewish , you may judge the significance of yourself ) .
The balance of stock is owned by major commercial member banks .
According to Devvy Kidd , " Why A Bankrupt America ? "
The Federal Reserve pays the Bureau of Engraving & Printing approximately $ 23 for each 1,000 notes printed .
10,000 $ 100 notes ( one million dollars ) would thus cost the Federal Reserve $ 230 .
They then secure a pledge of collateral equal to the face value from the U.S. government .
The collateral is our land , labor , and assets ... collected by their agents , the IRS .
By authorizing the Fed to regulate and create money ( and thus inflation ) , Congress gave private banks power to create profits at will .
As Lindberg put it : " The new law will create inflation whenever the trusts want inflation ... they can unload the stocks on the people at high prices during the excitement and then bring on a panic and buy them back at low prices ... the day of reckoning is only a few years removed . "
That day came in 1929 , with the Stock Market crash and Great Depression .
One of the most important powers given to the Fed was the right to buy and sell government securities , and provide loans to member banks so they might also purchase them .
This provided another built - in mechanism for profit to the banks , if government debt was increased .
All that was needed was a method to pay off the debt .
This was accomplished through the passage of the income tax in 1913 .
A national income tax was declared unconstitutional in 1895 by the Supreme Court , so a constitutional amendment was proposed in Congress by none other than ... Senator Nelson Aldrich .
As presented to the American people it seemed reasonable enough : income tax on only one percent of income under $ 20,000 , with the assurance that it would never increase .
Since it was graduated , the tax would " soak the rich " , ... but the rich had other plans , already devising a method of protecting wealth .
As described by Gary Allen in his 1976 book " The Rockefeller File , " " By the time the ( 16th ) Amendment had been approved by the states , the Rockefeller Foundation was in full operation ... about the same time that Judge Kenesaw Landis was ordering the breakup of the Standard Oil monopoly ... John D ... not only avoided taxes by creating four great tax - exempt foundations ; he used them as repositories for his ' divested ' interests ... made his assets non-taxable so that they might be passed down through generations without ... estate and gift taxes ... Each year the Rockefellers can dump up to half their incomes into their pet foundations and deduct the " donations " from their income tax . "
Exchanging ownership for control of wealth , foundations are also a handy means for promoting interests that benefit the wealthy .
Millions of foundation dollars have been " donated " to causes such as promoting the use of drugs , while degrading preventive medicine .
Since many drugs are made from coal tar derivatives , both oil companies and drug manufacturing concerns ( many Rockefeller owned or controlled ) are the main beneficiaries .
With the means to loan enormous sums to the government ( the Federal Reserve ) , a method to repay the debt ( income tax ) , and an escape from taxation for the wealthy , ( foundations ) , all that remained was an excuse to borrow money .
By some happy " coincidence , " in 1914 World War I began , and after American participation national debt rose from $ 1 billion to $ 25 billion .
Woodrow Wilson was elected President in 1913 , beating incumbent William Howard Taft , who had vowed to veto legislation establishing a central bank .
To divide the Republican vote and elect the relatively unknown Wilson , J.P. Morgan and Co. poured money into the candidacy of Teddy Roosevelt and his Progressive Party .
According to an eyewitness , Wilson was brought to Democratic Party headquarters in 1912 by Bernard Baruch , a wealthy banker .
He received an " indoctrination course " from those he met , and in return agreed , if elected : to support the projected Federal Reserve and the income tax , and " listen " to advice in case of war in Europe and on the composition of his cabinet .
Wilson 's top advisor during his two terms was a man named Colonel Edward M. House .
House 's biographer , Charles Seymour , called him the " unseen guardian angel " of the Federal Reserve Act , helping to guide it through Congress .
Another biographer wrote that House believed : " ... the Constitution , product of eighteenth - century minds ... was thoroughly outdated ; that the country would be better off if the Constitution could be scrapped and rewritten ... "
House wrote a book entitled " Philip Dru : Administrator , " published anonymously in 1912 .
The hero , Philip Dru , rules America and introduces radical changes , such as a graduated income tax , a central bank , and a " league of nations . "
World War I produced both a large national debt , and huge profits for those who had backed Wilson .
Baruch was appointed head of the War Industries Board , where he exercised dictatorial power over the national economy .
He and the Rockefellers were reported to have earned over $ 200 million during the war .
Wilson backer Cleveland Dodge sold munitions to the allies , while J.P. Morgan loaned them hundreds of millions , with the protection of U.S. entry into the war .
While profit was certainly a motive , the war was also useful to justify the notion of world government .
William Hoar reveals in " Architects of Conspiracy " that during the 1950s , government investigators examining the records of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace , a long - time promoter of globalism , found that several years before the outbreak of World War I , the Carnegie trustees were planning to involve the U.S. in a general war , to set the stage for world government .
The main obstacle was that Americans did not want any involvement in European wars .
Some kind of incident , such as the explosion of the battleship Main , which provoked the Spanish - American war , would have to be provided as provocation .
This occurred when the Lusitania , carrying 128 Americans on board , was sunk by a German submarine , and anti-German sentiment was aroused .
When war was declared , U.S. propaganda portrayed all Germans as Huns and fanged serpents , and all Americans opposing the war as traitors .
What was not revealed at the time , however , was that the Lusitania was transporting war munitions to England , making it a legitimate target for the Germans .
Even so , they had taken out large ads in the New York papers , asking that Americans not take passage on the ship .
The evidence seems to point to a deliberate plan to have the ship sunk by the Germans .
Colin Simpson , author of " The Lusitania , " wrote that Winston Churchill , head of the British Admiralty during the war , had ordered a report to predict the political impact if a passenger ship carrying Americans was sunk .
German naval codes had been broken by the British , who knew approximately where all U - boats near the British Isles were located .
According to Simpson , Commander Joseph Kenworthy , of British Naval Intelligence , stated : " The Lusitania was deliberately sent at considerably reduced speed into an area where a U - boat was known to be waiting ... escorts withdrawn . "
Thus , even though Wilson had been reelected in 1916 with the slogan " He kept us out of war , " America soon found itself fighting a European war .
Actually , Colonel House had already negotiated a secret agreement with England , committing the U.S. to the conflict .
It seems the American public had little say in the matter .
With the end of the war and the Versailles Treaty , which required severe war reparations from Germany , the way was paved for a leader in Germany such as Hitler .
Wilson brought to the Paris Peace Conference his famous " fourteen points , " with point fourteen being a proposal for a " general association of nations , " which was to be the first step towards the goal of One World Government - the League of Nations .
Wilson 's official biographer , Ray Stannard Baker , revealed that the League was not Wilson 's idea .
" ... not a single idea -- in the Covenant of the League was original with the President . "
Colonel House was the author of the Covenant , and Wilson had merely rewritten it to conform to his own phraseology .
The League of Nations was established , but it , and the plan for world government eventually failed because the U.S. Senate would not ratify the Versailles Treaty .
Pat Robertson , in " The New World Order , " states that Colonel House , along with other internationalists , realized that America would not join any scheme for world government without a change in public opinion .
After a series of meetings , it was decided that an " Institute of International Affairs " , with two branches , in the United States and England , would be formed .
The British branch became known as the Royal Institute of International Affairs , with leadership provided by members of the Round Table .
Begun in the late 1800's by Cecil Rhodes , the Round Table aimed to federate the English speaking peoples of the world , and bring it under their rule .
The Council on Foreign Relations was incorporated as the American branch in New York on July 29 , 1921 .
Founding members included Colonel House , and " ... such potentates of international banking as J.P. Morgan , John D. Rockefeller , Paul Warburg , Otto Kahn , and Jacob Schiff ... the same clique which had engineered the establishment of the Federal Reserve System , " according to Gary Allen in the October 1972 issue of " AMERICAN OPINION . "
The founding president of the CFR was John W. Davis , J.P. Morgan 's personal attorney , while the vice - president was Paul Cravath , also representing the Morgan interests .
Professor Carroll Quigley characterized the CFR as " ... a front group for J.P. Morgan and Company in association with the very small American Round Table Group . "
Over time Morgan influence was lost to the Rockefellers , who found that one world government fit their philosophy of business well .
As John D. Rockefeller , Sr. had said : " Competition is a sin , " and global monopoly fit their needs as they grew internationally .
Antony Sutton , a research fellow for the Hoover Institution for War , Revolution , and Peace at Stanford University , wrote of this philosophy : " While monopoly control of industries was once the objective of J.P. Morgan and J.D. Rockefeller , by the late nineteenth century the inner sanctums of Wall Street understood the most efficient way to gain an unchallenged monopoly was to ' go political ' and make society go to work for the monopolists -- under the name of the public good and the public interest . "
Frederick C. Howe revealed the strategy of using government in a 1906 book , " Confessions of a Monopolist " : " These are the rules of big business ...
Get a monopoly ; let society work for you ; and remember that the best of all business is politics ... "
As corporations went international , national monopolies could no longer protect their interests .
What was needed was a one world system of government controlled from behind the scenes .
This had been the plan since the time of Colonel House , and to implement it , it was necessary to weaken the U.S. politically and economically .
During the 1920's , America enjoyed a decade of prosperity , fueled by the easy availability of credit .
Between 1923 and 1929 the Federal Reserve expanded the money supply by sixty - two percent .
When the stock market crashed , many small investors were ruined , but not " insiders . "
In March of 1929 Paul Warburg issued a tip the Crash was coming , and the largest investors got out of the market , according to Allen and Abraham in " None Dare Call it Conspiracy . "
With their fortunes intact , they were able to buy companies for a fraction of their worth .
Shares that had sold for a dollar might now cost a nickel , and the buying power , and wealth , of the rich increased enormously .
Louis McFadden , Chairman of the House Banking Committee declared : " It was not accidental .
It was a carefully contrived occurrence ...
The international bankers sought to bring about a condition of despair here so that they might emerge as rulers of us all . "
Curtis Dall , son - in - law of FDR and a syndicate manager for Lehman Brothers , an investment firm , was on the N.Y.
Stock Exchange floor the day of the crash .
In " FDR : My Exploited Father - In - Law , " he states : " ... it was the calculated ' shearing ' of the public by the World - Money powers triggered by the planned sudden shortage of call money in the New York Market . "
The Crash paved the way for the man Wall Street had groomed for the presidency , FDR .
Portrayed as a " man of the little people " , the reality was that Roosevelt 's family had been involved in New York banking since the eighteenth century .
Frederic Delano , FDR 's uncle , served on the original Federal Reserve Board .
FDR attended Groton and Harvard , and in the 1920's worked on Wall Street , sitting on the board of directors of eleven different corporations .
Dall wrote of his father - in - law : " ... Most of his thoughts , his political ' ammunition , '... were carefully manufactured for him in advance by the CFR - One World Money group .
Brilliantly ... he exploded that prepared ' ammunition ' in the middle of an unsuspecting target , the American people -- and thus paid off and retained his internationalist political support . "
Taking America off the gold standard in 1934 , FDR opened the way to unrestrained money supply expansion , decades of inflation -- and credit revenues for banks .
Raising gold prices from $ 20 an ounce to $ 35 , FDR and Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau , Jr. ( son of a founding CFR member ) , gave international bankers huge profits .
FDR 's most remembered program , the New Deal , could only be financed through heavy borrowing .
In effect , those who had caused the Depression loaned America the money to recover from it .
Then , through the National Recovery Administration , proposed by Bernard Baruch in 1930 , they were put in charge of regulating the economy .
FDR appointed Baruch disciple Hugh Johnson to run the NRA , assisted by CFR member Gerard Swope .
With broad powers to regulate wages , prices , and working conditions , it was , as Herbert Hoover wrote in his memoirs : " ... pure fascism ; ... merely a remaking of Mussolini's ' corporate state ' ... "
The Supreme Court eventually ruled the NRA unconstitutional .
During the FDR years , the Council on Foreign Relations captured the political life of the U.S. Besides Treasury Secretary Morgenthau , other CFR members included Secretary of State Edward Stettinus , War Secretary Henry Stimson , and Assistant Secretary of State Sumner Welles .
Since 1934 almost every United States Secretary of State has been a CFR member ; and ALL Secretaries of War or Defense , from Henry L. Stimson through Richard Cheney .
The CIA has been under CFR control almost continuously since its creation , starting with Allen Dulles , founding member of the CFR and brother of Secretary of State under President Eisenhower , John Foster Dulles .
Allen Dulles had been at the Paris Peace Conference , joined the CFR in 1926 , and later became its president .
John Foster Dulles had been one of Woodrow Wilson 's young proteges at the Paris Peace Conference .
A founding member of the CFR ... he was an in - law of the Rockefellers , Chairman of the Board of the Rockefeller Foundation , and Board Chairman of the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace .
In 1940 FDR defeated internationalist Wendell Willkie , who wrote a book entitled " One World , " and later became a CFR member .
Congressman Usher Burdick protested at the time on the floor of the House that Willkie was being financed by J.P. Morgan and the New York utility bankers .
Polls showed few Republicans favored him , yet the media portrayed him as THE Republican candidate .
Since that time nearly ALL presidential candidates have been CFR members .
President Truman , who was not a member , was advised by a group of " wise men , " all six of whom were CFR members , according to Gary Allen .
In 1952 and 1956 , CFR Adlai Stevenson challenged CFR Eisenhower .
In 1960 , CFR Kennedy ( who was probably killed because he had the courage NOT to go along with all their plans ) CFR Nixon .
In 1964 the GOP stunned the Establishment by nominating its candidate over Nelson Rockefeller .
Rockefeller and the CFR wing proceeded to picture Barry Goldwater as a dangerous radical .
In 1968 CFR Nixon ran against CFR Humphrey .
The 1972 " contest " featured CFR Nixon vs. CFR McGovern .
CFR candidates for president include George McGovern , Walter Mondale , Edmund Muskie , John Anderson , and Lloyd Bentsen .
In 1976 we had Jimmy Carter , who is a member of the Trilateral Commission , created by David Rockefeller and CFR member Zbigniew Brzezinski with the goal of economic linkage between Japan , Europe , and the United States , and : " ... managing the world economy ... a smooth and peaceful evolution of the global system . "
We have also had ( though his name strangely disappears from the membership list in 1979 ) CFR director ( 1977 - 79 ) George Bush , and last but not least , CFR member Bill Clinton .
They have all promoted the " New World Order , " controlled by the United Nations .
The problem is that " ... the present United Nations organization is actually the creation of the CFR and is housed on land in Manhattan donated to it by the family of current CFR chairman David Rockefeller , " as Pat Robertson describes it .
The original concept for the UN was the outcome of the Informal Agenda Group , formed in 1943 by Secretary of State Cordell Hull .
All except Hull were CFR members , and Isaiah Bowman , a founding member of the CFR , originated the idea .
The American delegation to the San Francisco meeting that drafted the charter of the United Nations in 1949 included CFR members Nelson Rockefeller , John Foster Dulles , John McCloy , and CFR members who were communist agents -- Harry Dexter White , Owen Lattimore , and the Secretary - General of the conference , Alger Hiss .
In all , the Council sent forty - seven of its members in the United States delegation , effectively controlling the outcome .
Since that time the CFR and its friends in the mass media ( largely controlled by CFR members such as Katherine Graham of the " Washington Post " and Henry Luce of " Time , Life " ) , foundations , and political groups have lobbied consistently to grant the United Nations more authority and power .
Bush and the Gulf War were but one of the latest calls for a " New World Order . "
Admiral Chester Ward , a member of the CFR for over a decade , became one of its harshest critics , revealing its inner workings in a 1975 book , " Kissinger ON THE COUCH . "
In it he states " The most powerful cliques in these elitist groups have one objective in common : they want to bring about the surrender of the sovereignty and national independence of the United States . "
Most members are one - world - government ideologists whose long - term goals were officially summed up in September 1961 State Department Document 7277 , adopted by the Nixon Administration : " ... elimination of all armed forces and armaments except those needed to maintain internal order within states and to furnish the United Nations with peace forces ... by the time it ( UN global government ) would be so strong no nation could challenge it . "
Within the CFR there exists a " much smaller group but more powerful ... made up of Wall Street international bankers and their key agents .
Primarily , they want the world banking monopoly from whatever power ends up in control of the global government ... This CFR faction is headed by the Rockefeller brothers , " according to Ward .
What must be remembered is that this is not some lunatic - fringe group ... these are members of one of the most powerful private organizations in the world : the people who determine and control American economic , social , political , and military policy .
Members ' influence and control extends to " leaders in academia , public service , business , and the media , " according to the CFR 1993 " Annual Report . "
Their founding they describe as : " American Participants in the Paris Peace Conference decided that it was time for more private Americans to become familiar with the increasing responsibilities and obligations of the United States ... there was a need for an organization able to provide for the continuous study of U.S. foreign police for the BENEFIT OF ITS MEMBERS ( emphasis mine ) and a wider audience of interested Americans . "
They sponsor hundreds of programs , where members " exchange views with American and foreign officials and policy experts ... discuss foreign policy issues ... consider international issues of concern to the business community " ( Corporate business ) , and " ... affiliated groups of community leaders throughout the United states ... meet with decision makers . "
The CFR states that it is " host to many views , advocate of none , " and it " has no affiliation with the U.S. government . "
No , no affiliation at all , if you do n't count : " A Council member was elected president of the United States ... Dozens of other Council colleagues were called to serve in cabinet and sub- cabinet positions , " as they describe it in " Foreign Affairs , " along with many members of Congress , the Supreme Court , the Joint Chiefs , the Federal Reserve , and many other Federal bureaucrats .
They are not AFFILIATED with government , they ARE the government , in effect .
One re-occurring view was stated in the 50th anniversary issue of " Foreign Affairs , " the official publication of the CFR .
In an article by Kingman Brewster , Jr. entitled " Reflections on Our National Purpose . "
Our purpose should be , according to him , to do away with our nationality , to " take some risks in order to invite others to pool their sovereignty with ours ... "
These " risks " include disarming to the point where we would be helpless against the " peace - keeping " forces of a global UN government .
We should happily surrender our sovereignty to the world government in the interests of the " world community . "
Today we have the spectacle of Spc. 4 Michael New , a U.S. soldier in Germany who refuses to wear the uniform of the UN , facing an " administrative discharge . "
He states rightly that he swore an oath to defend the U.S. Constitution , not the United Nations .
Many other Americans have taken that same oath , such as myself , and believe it is our sworn duty still to defend the Constitution , since an oath sworn before God must be fulfilled .
( Why else do we swear to tell the truth in our courts , or when taking public office ? )
Is it a crime these days to actually BELIEVE in God and the oath that was taken ?
Meanwhile , others who attempt to destroy the Constitution and our sovereignty are given honors and position ... At least they are not hypocrites ... only supremely arrogant .
" In short , the ' house of world order ' will have to be built from the bottom up rather than from the top down ...
An end run around national sovereignty , eroding it piece by piece , will accomplish much more than the old fashioned assault ... " in the opinion of Richard N. Gardner , former deputy assistant Secretary of State in " Foreign Affairs , " April 1974 .
James Warburg , son of CFR founder Paul Warburg , and a member of FDR's " brain trust , " testified before the Senate Foreign Relations Committee on February 17 , 1950 , " We shall have world government whether or not you like it -- by conquest or consent . "
Is this an AMERICAN speaking , or a dangerous lunatic ?
Who is this " We " who threatens to CONQUER us ?
They are a group that actually has the power to do it , and is doing it every day , bit by bit .
CFR Members in the mass media , education , and entertainment push their propaganda of " humanism " and world brotherhood .
We should all live in peace under a world government , and forget about such selfish things as nationalities and patriotism .
We can solve our own problems .
We do n't need God , or morals , or values : it 's all relative , anyway , right ?...
Because if we actually had some moral character and values , we might be able to discern that these people are actually EVIL .
The Bible says that the LOVE of money is the root of all evil ( 1 Tim. 6:10 ) .
These people are evil because they love money and power , and greed drives them to do anything to achieve their goals .
They have lost all morality and conscience , and believe such concepts , as well as our Constitution , " outdated " .
THAT is insanity -- to have more wealth than can be spent , and still it is never enough .
They have to control governments , start wars , conspire to rule the world ; least the " common people " wake up to how they have gained their wealth , take it away from them , and demand that they pay the price for their crimes .
That is why they constantly pit us one against the other , with " Diversity , " Affirmative Action , and other programs , ... black against white , men against women , rural against urban , ranchers against environmentalists , and on and on ... least we look in their direction .
We The People are held to a much higher standard .
If we threaten the President or a public official , we are charged with a crime ... yet the One - World - Gang can threaten the Constitution and the liberties of We The People , the sovereign rulers of this nation , and nothing is said or done .
Perhaps they do not fear what Man can do to them ... they believe they have arranged everything , and their power and wealth will prevail in this world .
However , those among them who have sworn an oath before God to uphold and defend the Constitution : the President , members of Congress , and the military ; may find one day that they do indeed have something to fear .
List of CFR Members
Colonel House , the fallen angel , still has relatives controlling the CFR .
Karen Elliot House is Chairman of the Membership Committee , and a member of the Nominating Committee , along with Jeane Kirkpatrick .
David Rockefeller is now " Honorary Chairman of the Board " , after serving as Chairman 1970 - 1985 ; and " Director Emeritus , " after serving as a Director 1949 - 1985 .
Peter G. Peterson is Chairman , Admiral B. R. Inman is Vice Chairman , while Thomas Foley and Jeane Kirkpatrick are Directors serving on the Executive Committee .
These " private citizens " have access to government officials and policy makers as often as they wish , yet the results of their meetings can only be given to other government officials , corporate officers , or law partners .
Participants are forbidden to transmit an attributed statement to any public medium , such as newspapers or TV , where there is " risk that it will promptly be widely circulated or published , " as the " Annual Report " puts it .
Should not OUR public officials be forbidden to meet in secret with private groups ?
Public officials should only be allowed to discuss public business and policy in a public forum .
The Public ... remember US ?
There is much more to say about this group and their plans for America .
Gary Allen , in " The Rockefeller File , " states that they are behind the many regional government plans , which would abolish city , county , and state lines , leaving us at the mercy of federal bureaucrats ; and behind the push for " land use " controls .
They want " federal control of everything .
Since they intend to control the federal government ... "
There are also the many allegations of involvement in gun running , drug smuggling , prostitution and sex slaves ; and the many mysterious assassinations and " suicides " of witnesses and others who get too close to the truth ... but that is another story .

Hei , denne artikkelen er over ett år gammel og kan inneholde utdatert informasjon
| || ( Dagbladet.no ) : Tysk politi har arrestert en mann og evakuert skolen Gymnasium Carolinum i Ansbach i Bayern i Tyskland .
Første melding gikk på at fire elever skal ha blitt skadd da en mann kastet en brannbombe mot elever i 8.35 - tida i dag tidlig , Molotov - Cocktail , på en videregående skole , melder den tyske avisa Bild .
- Skutt av politiet
Ifølge avisa skal den pågrepne være en 19 år gammel elev ved skolen .
Mannen skal ifølge nyhetsbyråaet AP angrepet skolen med en øks og brannbomber .
Det skal også ha blitt løsnet skudd og det er uklart om det er flere gjerningsmenn .
Ifølge avisa Süddeutschen.de ble den antatte gjerningsmannen skutt av politiet på stedet med flere skudd .
Politiet bekrefter nå overfor nyhetsbyrået AP at ti personer er skadd , inkludert mannen som skal ha angrepet skolen .
Det skal både være elever og lærerer blant de skadde .
Flere er sendt til sykehus .
Evakuert
Ifølge tyske N24.de er ti personer skadd - tre av dem alvorlig , det siste er foreløpig bekrefta .
Politiet opplyser at ingen av elevene ble livstruende skadet , skriver SkyNews .
Politiet er foreløpig tause om hendelsen .
Overfor Welt .de bekrefter de likevel hendelsen .
- Det er røyk og brennmerker flere steder i skolebygningen , sier politiets talsperson Ralf Koch .
De skriver at én person skal være hardt skadd , men ikke livstruende .
Politiet har gjennomsøkt skolebygningen etter mistenkelige gjenstander og eventuelle andre gjerningspersoner , men ifølge Koch , skal situasjonen nå ha roet seg , melder nyhetsbyrået AP .
Har søster på skolen
En student fra området skriver på Twitter om episoden :
- En melding til våre familier : Det har gått bra med oss .
Heldigvis , skriver Julius Kramer på twitter .
Han går ikke selv på skolen , men det gjør søsteren hans .
- Hun er heldigvis i sikkerhet .
Hun var på skolen , men ikke der det skjedde .
Hun fortalte at alle ble evakuert og det var kaotisk en stund , sier Kramer på telefon til Dagbladet .
Han håper nå at de skadde elevene blir friske og at det ikke skjer nye angrep .

- Det er skummelt å tenke på at slikt kan skje , men nå får vi bare håper at de skadde kommer fra dette i god behold , sier Kramer til Dagbladet .
Skolen har et sted mellom 600 og 700 elever .

Mac OS X Snow Leopard cuts in half the launch - time overhead of starting the Objective - C runtime , and simultaneously saves a few hundred KB of memory per app .
This comes for free to every app , courtesy of one of the few pieces of Mac OS X that lives below even the Objective - C runtime : dyld .
dyld and the shared cache dyld is the dynamic loader and linker .
When your process starts , dyld loads your executable and its shared libraries into memory , links the cross-library C function and variable references together , and starts execution on its way towards main ( ) .
In theory a shared library could be different every time your program is run .
In practice , you get the same version of the shared libraries almost every time you run , and so does every other process on the system .
The system takes advantage of this by building the dyld shared cache .
The shared cache contains a copy of many system libraries , with most of dyld 's linking and loading work done in advance .
Every process can then share that shared cache , saving memory and launch time .
( Incidentally , the shared cache beats the pants off the pre-Leopard prebinding system that was supposed to achieve the same optimizations .
Remember the post - install " Optimizing System Performance " step that often took longer than the install itself ?
That was prebinding being updated .
Rebuilding the shared cache is so blazingly fast that the installer does n't bother to report it anymore . )
Objective - C selector uniquing Leopard 's dyld shared cache is great for C code , but it did n't do anything to help Objective - C's startup overhead .
The single biggest launch cost for Objective - C is selector uniquing .
The app and every shared library contain their own copies of selector names like " alloc " and " init " .
The runtime needs to choose a single canonical SEL pointer value for each selector name , and then update the metadata for every call site and method list to use the blessed unique value .
This means building a big hash table ( memory ) , calling strcmp ( ) a lot ( time ) , and modifying copy - on - write metadata ( more memory ) .
There are tens of thousands of unique selectors present in a typical process .
If you run `strings / usr / lib / libobjc.dylib` on Leopard you can see the thirty - thousand - line built - in selector table that was a previous attempt to reduce the memory cost .
Even so the cost goes up with every new class and method added to Cocoa .
framework ; left unchecked , an identical app would take longer to launch and use more memory after every OS upgrade .
The obvious solution ?
Do the work of selector uniquing in the dyld shared cache .
Build a selector table into the shared cache itself , and update the selector references in the cached copy of the shared libraries .
Then you save memory because every process shares the same selector table , and save time because the runtime does not need to rebuild it during every app launch .
The runtime only needs to fix the selector references from the app itself .
The catch ?
Selectors are too dynamic to be implemented as C symbols , so the shared cache construction tool needed to be taught how to read and write Objective - C's metadata .
Optimization WIN Snow Leopard 's dyld shared cache uniques Objective - C selectors , and Snow Leopard 's Objective - C runtime recognizes when the selectors in a shared library are already uniqued courtesy of the shared cache .
About half of the runtime 's initialization time is eliminated , making warm app launch several tenths of a second faster .
Typical memory savings is 200 - 500 KB per process , adding up to a few megabytes system - wide .
When this optimization ships on the iPhone OS side , it 's estimated to save 1 MB on a 128 MB device .
The iPhone performance team would pay any number of arms and legs for that kind of gain .
You can watch the system in action with various debugging flags .

Look for the count of dirty pages ; each dirty page is 4 KB eaten by that process .
With 64 - bit TextEdit
I see the dirty page count jump from 725 to 1069 after disabling the optimization .
This is an overestimate - many of those pages would have been not - dirty in Leopard because of the old built - in selector table - but it does show the magnitude of the win .
The Objective - C runtime does more than just selector uniquing during launch .
Future improvements to the dyld shared cache may precompute some of that other work , to further improve launch time , save memory , and reduce the cost of linking to Objective - C code that you do n't actually use .
But selector uniquing as seen in Snow Leopard is by far the biggest bang for the buck .

Ares I -X has launched on the second attempt at 11:30 am Eastern , and although the First Stage and the Upper Stage Simulator ( USS ) appeared to recontact after separation ( later confirmed that no recontact took place ) – managers are claiming the flight to be a success .
Sources also claim one of the FS ’ parachutes failed , with the booster splashing down with two working parachutes .
Ares I - X Attempt 2 ( pre-launch ) :
The first launch attempt on Tuesday was delayed for 24 hours due to several weather rule violations , including excessive wind speeds at the launch pad – which were exceeding the 20 - knot limit – along with concerns about clouds with moisture that could have caused static build - up on the rocket and led to communication issues – known technically as triboelectrification .
With slight delays caused by issues other than the weather – such as the problem with the removal of a protective cover from the top of the vehicle and the ship that breached the strict Eastern Range exclusion zone – time was lost prior to coming out of the four minute hold .
At one point , the count managed to head past the hold and got as close to as two and a half minutes to launch , before the weather once again closed in – with Weather Office Kathy Winters giving notice of unacceptable conditions at T - 0 .
While lightning and rain were observed near the launch pad overnight , forecasters were more hopeful for acceptable conditions for the Wednesday launch attempt , predicting a 60 percent chance of favorable weather , with four hours of window available to launch director Ed Mango .
However , triboelectrification weather conditions moved the launch back to 11:30 am Eastern .
Recent – over the past one year period – Ares I - X Articles on NASASpaceflight.com can be found on this link :
http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/tag/ares-i-x/
Key Launch Events :
With the countdown overviewed in the opening launch attempt article , Wednesday ’s attempt focused on the launch events , as Ares I - X opened the flight test era of the Ares launch vehicle program – albeit a program that may yet be cancelled in the coming months .
At liftoff , Ares I - X will weigh 1.8 million lbs , with the four segment SRB providing between 2.6 and 3.3 million lbs of thrust that will propel the Ares I - X to a height of 130,000 ft .
The SRB nozzle will be gimbaled at Mission Elapsed Time ( MET ) 0.1 seconds for the “ fly away ” maneuver ( designed to pull I - X away from the launch tower ) .
First motion off the MLP is expected at MET 0.2 seconds .
The RoCS ( Roll Control System ) will be enabled and the 90 - degree roll program started at MET six seconds .
The “ fly away ” maneuver will be considered complete at MET 20 - seconds .
For the first 91 seconds of flight , the RoCS system will be activated every 10 seconds to counter any axial roll of the vehicle .
MaxQ is expected at ~MET 50 seconds .
The Flight Control System phase of flight will transition into the separation phase of flight at MET 2 minutes 00.6 seconds .
According to flight timelines , SRB burnout is expected at MET 2 minutes 4 seconds ; however , the latest possible time of SRB burnout is MET 2 minutes 12 seconds .
As such , all further flight times are based on this no later than SRB burnout time .
The Booster Deceleration Motor and Pyro Initiator Controller will be armed for separation at MET 2 minutes 13.9 seconds with the Thruster Vector Control system commanded to “ null ” and RoCS deactivated at MET 2 minutes 14 seconds .
The SRB APU will be shutdown at MET 2 minutes 14.5 seconds .
Eight Booster Deceleration Motors will fire at MET 2 minutes 14.9 seconds , followed 0.1 seconds later by First Stage and USS separation .
The Booster Deceleration Motors are designed to pull the SRB clear of the frustum and USS .
At the time of SRB and USS separation , the Ares I - X will be travelling at approximately mach 4.76 at an altitude of 130,000 ft .
The maximum acceleration force during flight will be 2.48 g .
The SRB tumble motors will fire at MET 2 minutes 18 - seconds , inducing a horizontal tumble into the SRB ’s profile .
This will increase drag on the SRB , preventing recontact with the free flying USS and slowing the SRB down during reentry .
The Recovery Control Unit pyro will be armed at MET 2 minutes 45 - seconds .
Booster parachutes in focus :
After coasting to an altitude of 150,000 ft , the parachute system will engage at 16,000 ft ( or MET 5 minutes 15 seconds ) with the deployment of pilot chutes .
The main chutes will be deployed at MET 6 minutes 15 seconds , brining the SRB to a manageable speed for splashdown in the Atlantic .
The First Stage nozzle will be severed from the SRB at MET 6 minutes 35 seconds , with splashdown occurring ~ 147 miles downrange from KSC just prior to MET 7 minutes .
The USS will also coast to approximately 150,000 ft before plunging into the Atlantic Ocean at near terminal velocity .
The USS is expected to break apart upon impact with the water and sink to the ocean floor .
The parachute recovery system is the most mature element of the Ares hardware that is currently under development .
Several tests have been carried out at the US Army Yuma Proving Grounds on the giant parachutes which are set to return the five segment Ares I first stage to a splash down in the Atlantic Ocean .
The latest successful test was just this month , with a 72,000 pound test payload , including the Jumbo Drop Test Vehicle ( JDTV ) , dropped from the back of a US Air Force C - 17 aircraft at 25,000 feet – designed to test the design load limits of the Ares I main parachute system .
Engineers from NASA ’s Marshall Space Flight Center ( MSFC ) manage the team conducting the tests , designed to place 100 percent of the flight dynamic pressures on the main parachute canopy .
The main parachute , measuring 150 feet in diameter and weighing 2,000 pounds , is the largest rocket parachute ever built and the primary element of the vehicle ’s deceleration and recovery system , which also includes a pilot parachute and drogue parachute .
The parachutes work in tandem providing the drag necessary to slow the descent of the huge Ares I solid rocket motor , allowing for a relatively gentle splashdown and subsequent recovery .
While Ares I - X is a four segment motor , an “ empty ” fifth segment – known as the “ XL ” motor segment – makes up the first stage .
The change of design to the four segment Shuttle booster will result in additional useful data that will be gained after Ares I - X ’s powered flight ends .
In fact , the recovery of the First Stage via the parachute system is classed as the Priority 4 task of this test flight : “ Demonstrate FS ( First Stage ) entry dynamics and sequencing of events ( parachute deployment , etc. ) , ” noted Launch Readiness Review Documentation ( presentations on L2 ) .
“ Demonstrate First Stage separation sequencing , quantify First Stage atmospheric entry dynamics , and evaluate parachute performance . ”
With the Ares booster recovery system including some of the heritage from the shuttle ’s booster systems , issues on the final flights of the shuttle are also providing important information for the next generation of space vehicle .
STS - 128 IFA
Review highlights SRB parachute failure :
Such information can be seen as recently as the last shuttle mission , STS - 128 – when it was revealed by the In Flight Anomaly Review ( IFA ) review that the main parachute on the Right Hand Solid Rocket Booster recovery system failed , leading to the booster impacting the ocean with a higher than expected force .
The review was conducted at a Program Requirements Control Board ( PRCB ) meeting , with 15 departments presenting issues found prior , during and after Discovery returned to Earth .
A large number of departments noted no issues .
The results of the IFA review created the baseline for the next mission ’s Flight Readiness Review ( FRR ) – namely Atlantis ’ STS - 129 mission in November , and also Discovery ’s next mission – STS - 131 next year .
Highlights from the IFA presentations – all acquired by L2 – include the main parachute anomaly on the Right Hand Booster .
As with Ares I - X , the booster has three main parachutes that slow the expended booster during its splashdown in the Atlantic ahead of recovery and eventual reuse .
“ One of three RH main parachutes failed to fully inflate .
Data Acquisition System ( DAS ) indicated failure occurred 3.9 seconds after frustum separation .
Postflight inspection revealed damage on gore number 5 extending from above vent band to skirt band , ” noted the STS - 128 SRB IFA presentation .
“ Parachute on tenth flight .
Involved in previous failure on STS - 30 R .
Anomaly Resolution Team ( ART - 272 ) formed .
Investigation on - going .
Booster recovery not affected by loss of one parachute . ”
Several conclusions can be noted from the failure , that the booster still survived for potential reuse despite the loss of one of the main parachute , and that this parachute was on its tenth flight and was repaired from an issue it suffered on a previous flight .
The full results of how the parachutes performed with Ares I - X are expected just days after launch , once the booster and recovery systems are examined back in port .

RIO DE JANEIRO ( Reuters ) - Brazil aims to burnish its growing diplomatic stature by pushing Middle East peace next week as it welcomes Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad just two weeks after a visit by Israel ’s president .
EDITORS ' NOTE : Reuters and other foreign media are subject to Iranian restrictions on their ability to film or take pictures in Tehran .

For Ahmadinejad , the visits to Brazil and its South American neighbors Venezuela and Bolivia offer a chance to expand Iran ’s ties in a region where he already has a firm ally in Venezuela ’s leftist President Hugo Chavez .
Brazil , which has taken a much more conciliatory line over Iran ’s nuclear ambitions than Western allies , says talking to Iran is more likely to lead to progress on the nuclear issue and Middle East peace than isolating it .
But President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva ’s decision to open a dialogue with Ahmadinejad also carries risks if Brazil is seen as failing to press Western concerns over its nuclear program and complaints of human rights abuses .
The dialogue has the backing of U.S. President Barack Obama , who Brazilian government officials say asked Lula to talk with Ahmadinejad during a meeting in London in March .
“ We believe it is much more important to maintain a dialogue with Iran than to simply say no , leaving them stigmatized and isolated , ” Marco Aurelio Garcia , Lula ’s foreign policy advisor , told reporters in Rio de Janeiro last week .
“ Obama said a dialogue between Iran and Brazil is important . ”
Obama has said time is running out for diplomacy to resolve a long standoff over Iran ’s nuclear program , which the West fears is aimed at making weapons .
As it prepares to take up a rotating seat on the U.N. Security Council next year , Brazil is eager to show it is a serious diplomatic player and says it wants a role in fostering dialogue in the Middle East .
Israeli President Shimon Peres visited the South American nation last week and Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas visits this week and will meet Lula , who plans to travel to Israel and the Palestinian territories in March .
Analysts are skeptical that Brazil , a country with little diplomatic track record in the Middle East , can achieve breakthroughs with Iran or on an Israel - Palestinian peace deal .
“ I think the chances of Lula playing the role of bringing the U.S. and Iran together are negligible .
I think if that ’s the goal , they are setting themselves up for failure , ” said Michael Shifter , vice president for policy at the Inter - American Dialogue in Washington .
“ I think it ’s to reinforce the sense that they are a great power and can enjoy a range of contacts across the ideological spectrum , ” he said .
“ NOT JUST A THREAT ”
Garcia said Lula , who has shaped Brazil as a leader of the developing world in trade talks , made clear to Ahmadinejad that he should not make attacks on Israel or repeat his previous denial of the Holocaust during his visit .
Brazil has defended Iran ’s right to develop peaceful nuclear power , pointing to its own development of nuclear energy as a model .
Venezuela ’s Chavez sees Iran , along with China and Russia , as key to achieving his goal of weakening U.S. influence in Latin America , and has established ever - closer ties with Tehran in recent years .
Iran is helping Venezuela explore for uranium , and Washington sees the cozy relationship between the two as a potential security risk .
New York ’s District Attorney is investigating some Venezuelan banks for sanction - busting links to the Middle Eastern nation and U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates has accused Iran of subversive activity in Latin America .
Brazil ’s failure to criticize Iran strongly for its secrecy over its nuclear program or over Ahmadinejad ’s disputed re-election this year has drawn concern in the West that its approach may be too lenient .
Lula , whose government has been criticized for failing to condemn human rights abuses by other countries , has said the world should n’t meddle in Iran ’s affairs and compared its election dispute to the one in the United States in 2000 .
“ It ’s quite interesting that they ( Brazil ) want to do this bridge - building stuff yet they are very silent when it comes to U.N. debates on these things , ” a Western diplomat in Brazil said on condition of anonymity .
“ To be a real player you ’ve got to say tough things when it ’s not always palatable . ”

On Friday , October 9 , two space ships will crash into the moon , and you will be able to see it happen .
All you need to do is find the crater Cabeus , which is near the Moon 's south pole .
Be watching at 11:30 UT ( That 's 4:30 a.m. Pacific Time , 6:30 a.m. Central . )
Bring your telescope .
It should be a pretty good telescope .
According to NASA :
" We expect the debris plumes to be visible through mid-sized backyard telescopes 10 inches and larger , " says Brian Day of NASA / Ames .
Day is an amateur astronomer and the Education and Public Outreach Lead for LCROSS .
" The initial explosions will probably be hidden behind crater walls , but the plumes will rise high enough above the crater 's rim to be seen from Earth . "
If you live in the eastern part of the United States or anywhere towards daylight ( east ) from there , it may be too bright .
Hawaii is ideal within the US , but anywhere west of the Mississippi is a potential viewing spot .
I live four blocks east of the Mississippi , so I guess I 'll have to drag my telescope down to the shore and canoe across for better viewing !
There is another way to see the impacts : Tune in NASA TV .
Coverage starts at 3:15 a.m. PDT .
In some areas , you may get that station on your local cable system .
But why are the spaceships crashing into the Moon ?
Has something gone terribly wrong ?
Are we being invaded by aliens ?
Well , this is an experiment cooked up by NASA to see if there is water on the Moon .
First , a rocket called The Centaur will hit the moon .
This rocket weighs about 2,200 kg and it is going fast , so there will be a great deal of energy released .
A huge plume of debris will be blown up as much as 10 kilometers .
This plume will be observed from earth , the Hubble space telescope , and the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter ( LRO ) , and analyzed for presence of water .
However , close behind The Centaur will be the LCROSS space ship .
This craft has instrumentation on it that will allow a much more detailed analysis of the plume .
LCROSS will fly into the plume sent up by The Centaur , analyze the material really fast , and send its data back to earth .
And then ... it will also crash into the moon .
" If there 's water there , or anything else interesting , we 'll find it , " says Tony Colaprete of NASA Ames , the mission 's principal investigator .
LCROSS will hit the moon about four minutes after The Centaur .
The most interesting statement in NASA 's press release regarding this experiment is probably this one :
" Remember , we 've never done this before .
We 're not 100 % sure what will happen , and big surprises are possible . "
If you are interested in viewing this spectacular lunar experiment at a public event ( and the public events are quite diverse as to what they offer , see if there is one in your area and refer to the LCROSS Viewer 's Guide .
Before we launch into the perceived extra cost of e-juice packets and whether they deliver enough real value as to justify their cost , it ’s always a good idea to discuss consumer value or total use value .
If you buy anything , it is very tempting to conclude that just because you paid very little money for an item that you are getting a good value .
It ’s really tempting to think along these lines because spending money on a $ 5 item instead of plunking down some solid cash on a $ 300 item seems like such a slam dunk , right ?
Well , not quite .
What if you only ended up using the $ 5 item 10 times while you used the 300 item 30,000 times ?
In such a situation , your per use value is much better with the $ 300 item regardless of the initial sticker shock .
Keep this in mind .
Determining value has to go further than the sticker price of an item .
Focus on how likely you are to use the item as well as its durability - which impacts the number of uses you can get out of it .
The great thing about the vaping market is that there is always space for innovation .
There really is .
It seems that every single quarter , new vaping juices and flavor ranges come out .
It really is quite amazing because it highlights a tremendous amount of creativity and initiative out there .
People are not content simply coming up with a basic range of flavors .
There is a tremendous amount of attention focused on consumer needs .
A lot of this , of course , is due to competitive pressures .
If you are a creator or a manufacturer of e-juice , you really cannot stand still .
You ca n’t just rely on current market trends persisting for long , otherwise , you may find yourself at a competitive disadvantage because people ’s states change .
Believe it or not , people ’s preferences with e-juices pretty much change like fashion , that ’s why many online e-juice shops always come up with new vaping flavors .
Do you remember those skinny jeans that were all the rage a long time ago ?
Well , they ’re back .
Remember the mommy jeans that were very big in the 1980’s ?
Well , they ’re back .
But just as the tides go in and out , so do fashions .
Do n’t expect mommy jeans to remain hot and popular forever .
They probably have a few years left of popularity at most .
They will soon be replaced by another fashion trend .
This is just the nature of the beast .
The same applies to e-juice .
This is why a lot of manufacturers are quite wary regarding all - natural packets .
A lot of them think that this is a trend .
A lot of them think that this consumer preference probably will not last all that long .
Well , they ’re mistaken .
Keep in mind that natural e-juice is a distinct market category .
It is not a trend .
It is not just a flavor .
While it does contain many different flavors , the designation “ natural e-juice ” relates to the essence of the product .
Given this reality , we can all safely assume that this product category is going to stick around for quite some time .
It ’s not going to disappear overnight , just like a hot or really popular e-juice flavor of the past .
You have to understand that the difference between a trendy packet flavor and the category of the packet is like comparing the need for pants with mommy jeans .
Now , we all know that mommy jeans is just a style .
It ’s a fashion fad .
It ’s going to disappear with time .
Not so with humanity ’s need for clothing .
While it ’s anybody ’s guess how popular jeans will continue , you can bet that long into the future , people will still wear jeans regardless of how it ’s designed .
The design may change , but the need for the jeans or the preference for this type of clothing will continue to persist .
Keep this in mind when it comes to natural e-juice packets .
They deliver a tremendous amount of value because you know exactly where your e-juice is coming from .
There is no guesswork here .
You know that it ’s made from perfectly biological sources .
A lot of the times , these sources are organic in nature .
This is a big deal because there are no pesticide residues .
There is no chemical contamination at some level or another .
Besides all of that biochemical stuff , keep in mind that it also delivers a tremendous amount of psychological benefits .
You feel like you ’re not ingesting something artificial .
There is value to that .
The sense of relaxation that you get when you vape with such juice might be better .
There is no 800 - pound gorilla in the room demanding to be noticed .
You ’re not stuck with a feeling that somehow , some way , you ’re ingesting something that is unnatural , and this may lead to you suffering health issues sooner or later .
None of that is at play .
So this sense of freedom , openness and possibility is definitely worth paying extra for .
Keep this in mind because a lot of people are thinking that all - natural vape juices really do n’t bring much to the table .
They just focus on the issue using a very narrow lens .
They think that it ’s just all about biochemical compounds .
They think it ’s all about just proper formulation .
They completely neglect or overlook the fact that there are serious psychological benefits to be had .
At the very least , you do n’t feel like you ’re putting a gun in your mouth and pressing the trigger because , let ’s face it , that ’s how ingesting cigarettes feel like at some level or another .
Now , a lot of people would try to dance around this .
Many would flat out deny it , but it ’s always there like an 800 - pound gorilla .
Not so with all - natural e-juice .
You know where it comes from , you can insist on a particular type of formulation , and there is a tremendous sense of comfort , assurance and confidence .
This combination can mean the difference between vaping under stress and just truly exploring and enjoying all the benefits that vaping can and does bring to the table .
It ’s your choice .

Trump tells far - right group to stand down after failure to condemn the Proud Boys in TV debate
Our soils hold within them more carbon than all the forests in Western Europe A strategy to protect the health of England 's soils and ensure they continue to store carbon dioxide , will be published by the government later .
Experts say good soil not only produces strong crops , but is an effective store of carbon , and can reduce flooding by absorbing rain and river water .
But Environment Secretary Hilary Benn said population growth , transport and housing are threatening the soil .
Farmers have welcomed the government 's serious response to the issue .
The new strategy will include supporting farmers in managing their soil , a framework to protect peat habitats , safeguards for soils in urban areas and prevention of soil pollution .
Centuries of degradation Mr Benn said : " Soil is one of the building blocks of life .
Good quality soils are essential for a thriving farming industry , a sustainable food supply , and a healthy environment .
" Britain 's soils hold more carbon than all the trees in Europe 's forests - and their protection is critical if we are to successfully combat climate change .
" This is an important step in increasing the value we place on soil , and will safeguard this vital resource now and in the future . "
A Department for Environment , Food and Rural Affairs ( Defra ) spokesman said : " England 's soil has suffered over the last 200 years from the impacts of intensive farming and industrial pollution , and today is under threat from erosion by wind and rain , a loss of organic matter and nutrients , and pressure for development . "
The new strategy will set out plans to " halt and reverse " this degradation over the next 20 years .
The BBC 's environment correspondent , Sarah Mukherjee , said although farmers are pleased the government is taking the issue seriously , some say this report is behind the times .

Lawrence O'Donnell tears into Liz Cheney for her remarks criticizing President Obama for his visit to Dover AFB .
Liz Cheney lies again .
Chip off the old block .
O'DONNELL : When President Obama honored our Afghanistan war dead by taking part in a military ritual at Dover Air Force Base yesterday , it was easily predictable that a Republican would criticize him for it .
And in our fourth story on the Countdown , the former Vice President 's pet attack dog , his daughter Liz Cheney , has now done just that .
And once again , she was n't going to let the facts get in the way .
On the John Gibson radio show yesterday , Ms. Cheney was rehashing her father 's fact - free critique of President Obama 's war in Afghanistan , and then Mr. Gibson asked her about the President 's appearance at Dover Air Force Base .
LIZ CHENEY ( RADIO AUDIO ) : I do n't know why he went to Dover .
I mean , I think that clearly it is very important for a commander - in - chief , whenever he can in whatever way it possible , to pay tribute to our fallen soldiers , our fallen military folks .
But , I think , you know , what President Bush used to do was do it without the cameras , and I do n't understand sort of showing up with the White House Press Pool with photographers and asking the family if you can take pictures .
I just ... that 's really hard for me to get my head around — I think it 's an honorable and important thing for us to pay tribute .
There 's no greater sacrifice people make to the nation .
But , it was a surprising way for the President to choose to do it .
O'DONNELL : As we mentioned yesterday , President Bush never went to Dover Air Force Base to honor dead American soldiers on their final journey .
And Vice President Cheney ... never did either .
Hey Liz , have you ever lost a relative in battle ?
I have .
My cousin Johnny , West Point graduate like his father before him .
I wish the President or the Vice President had met his casket on the way home .
You know what ' never ' means , Liz ?
It means zero .
It means that in over seven years of two wars , your dad never left the comfort of his White House office or the Vice President 's mansion and got himself up to Dover to bear witness to how his warmongering fell on families of dead American soldiers .
Never , not once .
The body of 75 - year - old man sat decomposing on his Marina del Rey balcony for days because neighbors thought the lifeless figure was part of a Halloween display and did n’t call police .
Mostafa Mahmoud Zayed had apparently been dead since Monday with a single gunshot wound to one eye .
He was slumped over a chair on the third - floor balcony of his apartment on Bora Bora Way , said cameraman Austin Raishbrook , who owns RMG News and was on the scene Thursday when authorities were alerted to the body .
Neighbors told Raishbrook that they noticed the body Monday “ but did n’t bother calling authorities because it looked like a Halloween dummy , ” he said .
“ The body was in plain view of the entire apartment complex [ and ] they all did n’t do anything , ” Raishbrook said .
“ It ’s very strange .
It did look unreal , to be honest . ”

An investigator with the Los Angeles County Sheriff ’s Department said the case is an “ apparent suicide , ” and declined to comment further .
Coroner ’s officials were called to the complex at 6:42 p.m. Thursday , according to Capt .
John Kades of the county coroner ’s office .
The official cause of death has not be announced .
On Friday , Bora Bora
Way was quiet with neighbors and workers going about their routines .
From the street , which runs along a boat - filled marina , no evidence of the previous night ’s discovery remained .
“ I just knew him to say ‘ Hello , ’ and he was sweet and gentle , ” Patricia Kingery , out for a walk , said of Zayed .
“ He was always well - dressed and obviously active . ”
She pointed to what she said was Zayed ’s corner apartment , with two balconies , one facing the marina and the other looking over a grassy area with a man -made brook and fountain .

The railing of the latter balcony was draped with what appeared to be bedding .
Earl Kepler , a UPS executive visiting from the Washington , D.C. , area , said the complex seemed “ a little lonely , ” with few people out and about .
He was n’t surprised to hear that the dead man went undiscovered for a few days .
“ There does n’t seem to be a lot of community involvement , ” he said .

A couple of weeks ago some very interesting Windows news flew by under the radars that I think deserves much more credit than it received , considering how much we rely on the web and the impact this has on making it safer .
In the September 2009 update to the Windows Root Certificate Program , Microsoft has added to the list of trusted root certificate authorities StartCom Ltd , notably its first member who issues amongst others free SSL digital certificates .
What this means in practice is that out - of - the - box in Windows 7 and if installed as an optional patch under Windows Vista and XP , free digital certificates issued by StartCom will be inherently trusted by the operating system and its applications .
Besides simple identification , one other benefit delivered by digital certificates is the ability to transparently encrypt and secure the connection to a server via HTTPS and this is what makes what Microsoft did so notable .
Up and until now the digital certificates market has been dominated by large corporations who charge quite a pretty penny for the privilege , limiting the use of HTTPS .
Unfortunately at the same time due to the nature of digital certificates and the chain of trust , a limited number of root certificate authorities ( CA ) in operating systems such as Windows has limited the adoption of free digital certificates as offered by some companies like StartCom .
Granted Firefox and Safari has supported many of the certificate authorities issuing free certificates for some time , Microsoft has not , until now .
With StartCom as a Windows root CA , web developers now have a practical free alternative for digital certificates if they wish to secure their websites or web services that by default works with Internet Explorer and other Windows applications .
Not only is this great for developers but even more so users who can look forward to more websites that encrypt the data they send to and receive from – reducing the risks of sniffing and man - in - the - middle vulnerabilities , especially when using wireless and public networks .
Still , Devil ’s Slide is renowned locally for its stark beauty and treacherous mystique .
It played a starring role in the 1960 thriller “ Portrait in Black , ” in which Lana Turner and Anthony Quinn shove a car containing her dead husband over the edge .
Toward the southern end , a fair hike down , is Gray Whale Cove Beach , which has a good - sized parking lot on the eastern side of the road .
We decided to forgo this to avoid having to dart through moving cars and stopped instead at one of two narrow coast - side pullouts nearby .
Standing at the top of the cliffs , we had a clear sense of their imposing height and scale .
From here down to Santa Cruz , the next sizable city , is only 60 miles , and the drive can easily be done in under two hours .
But we took three meandering days , lingering in seaside towns and along the water .
The beaches where we stopped are state parks and , for the last several months , coastal residents had feared that some of them would be closed by Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger because of the state ’s budget crisis .
For the remainder of this fiscal year , however , the beaches will remain open , as savings were found elsewhere in the budget .
Although most of the shoreline is public in California , state - owned beaches provide ample parking and well - maintained paths .
Montara Beach , a well - sheltered and generally peaceful strip of pale gold sand , is the first of these beyond Devil ’s Slide , and we found it carpeted with delicate sand dollars .
From November to April , gray whales pass by on their annual migrations .
In the late 19th century , shipwrecks caused by jagged offshore rocks propelled the construction of the Point Montara Lighthouse , which stands about a half mile south of the beach and is still operated by the Coast Guard .
Hostel accommodations are available on the lighthouse grounds .
On Day 2 we stopped at the town of Princeton - by - the - Sea , where expansive tide pools displayed amber sea stars , pearlescent anemones and magenta urchins .
Vocal seals , dive - bombing pelicans and scurrying snowy plovers animated the broad expanse and , a few hundred feet northward around a point , the kids discovered wind - sculptured stumps of smooth , gray rock punctuating an otherworldly landscape .
In winter , crowds gather on the clifftops above this spot to watch extreme surfers challenge waves up to 70 feet high .
It ’s tough to beat logos that show some clever use of negative space .

Update :
A couple of other nice ideas , one for a company named Landfit , and another for Snooty Peacock .
After coming off of a con weekend , this is about how I feel .
I think I ’m zen , like I ’ve somehow conquered the ability to sleep , until about 3 pm .
Then it all catches up .
Apparently it hits this guy ( let ’s call him Geoff ) a little earlier , or he eats a late lunch .
Your call .

You cant even write well .
Thats the result of the sub standard backwards schools in Adelaide .
Writing about monkeys and children starving .
Spend a few nights with the Salvos feeding the homeless so you can write about that and at least people will go to your site and learn something loser .
Little dick typical male .
Face it when it comes to Adelaide it is full of dumb backwards hick arseholes that are totally devoid of social consciousness or culture .

I apologise for the delay in replying .
As you mentioned , Adelaide is a tad behind other cities not only in regards to consciousness and culture but also technology .
Your email was received by Adelaide 's only computer , a 386 housed in the public library powered by a duck on a treadmill , before being relayed to me by Morse code .
Should you wish to contact me direct next time , my home number is dot dot dash dot dash dot dot dash .

Roz KnorrTuesday 13 October 2009 9.18 amDavid ThorneRe : Re : Adelaide loserTypical coming from such backwards piece of crap city like Adelaide .
You just proved my point .
LOL !
Your reply shows what a bacwards hick you and everyone who lives in Adelaide is .
I have homes in Hong Kong , Britain , Paris , USA , & Hawai , as well as Australia .
I grew up in a house with 11 servants & a chaufer .
And honey I have friends living in Laurel Canyon , & California who earn $ 400,000 a day in rock & roll .
Poor Adeliade .
No culture and no class .
Be careful not to be a victim of a hit & run .
Accidents happen all the time , so much cheaper in Adelaide .
One phone call ... David ThorneTuesday 13 October 2009 9.51 amRoz KnorrRe : Re : Re : Adelaide loserDear Roz , Thankyou for your concern and kind offer but I should be fine for the moment in regards to monetary based injuries .
Recently , I set up a stall at a women 's golfing convention with a banner stating " Punch me in the head for one dollar . "
I made eight hundred and thirty dollars that day .
Tax free .
With the money raised , I intend to buy a bigger stall for next year 's convention .
It must be nice to own several homes all over the planet .
For many years I dreamt of experiencing the culture of Paris until I realised there would probably be a lot of French people there .
They should do something about that .
Contrary to your statement regarding Adelaide having no culture though , there is actually a large and thriving artistic community here but very little art is produced due mainly to the artists spending all their time displaying their scarves to each other and attending gallery exhibitions for the free alcohol , food and the chance to wash their armpits in the venue 's bathroom .

You would n't know a thing about culture being from Adelaide .
You are a bunch of inbred filthy convicts and are all a bunch of no hoppers .
I wo n't even quote you how much money I make from my busenesses that I have in New York , Britain or Japan .
David ThorneTuesday 13 October 2009 3.02 pmRoz KnorrRe : Re : Re : Re : Re : Adelaide loserDear Roz , Actually , while Adelaide may commonly be referred to as the murder capital of Australia due to having more serial killers per capita than any other city in Australia , it is ironically the only Australian capital cityfounded by convicts .
Adelaide is also referred to as the City of Churches due to the fact that there is a church on every corner .
It is not surprising therefore that Adelaide also has a long history of child pedophilia .
Another common misconception is that due to Adelaide 's high number of churches , the city must be a very religious one .
In fact , the number of churches is only necessary in order to cope with the number of funerals as a result of the number of murders that take place here .
You are also mistaken in regards to Adelaide containing no hoppers .
I myself regularly hop .
I am , in fact , the founder of the Adelaide Hopping Club , an organisation that meets each Tuesday to hop .
We have so many members that it is often standing room only at the meetings .
Which is obviously not a problem .
Recently , we have been planning an event in which we intend to hop non stop from Adelaide to Sydney to raise not only awareness for the sport of hopping but also funds for a new charity we have set up called The Roz Knorr Hopping Foundation which will provide poor people with no legs a single artificial leg and accompanying hopping instructional video inspiringly titled ' Never Give Up Hop ' .

You would n't know the first thing about charity or giving back to the community .
People from Adelaide do n't do anything for the underprivileged in society .
Go read Naomi Klein 's 1999 book " No Logo " and join the ant - globalist movement & start defacing corporate posters in public places with political statements , or visit a sweat shop with 7 year olds in Mexico & blog about it .
Until then you are just another selfish parasite taking from this planet .
Watch your back .
I leave for New York in my private plain this afternoon so I do n't have any time for anymore of your pathetic hick town nonsense .
Goodbye David .
David ThorneThursday 15 October 2009 11.55 amRoz KnorrRe : Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : Re : Adelaide loserDear Roz , Thankyou for excellent suggestions .
Unfortunately I cannot afford the airfare to Mexico and even if I did , I do not know any seven year olds to take .
It 's a pity as I have heard that you can get really cheap soccer balls there .
Coincidentally , I too have a private plain .
It is actually more of a field but going by the amount of back - packers discovered buried in the area , quite private regardless .
I was sitting in the middle of it reading your correspondence regarding poorly written books and eighties political statements when I realised you raise a valid point .
I organised a garage sale , in which I sold my neighbours outdoor furniture , and used the proceeds to move to Nimbin .
I spent today rubbing my body with crystals , dancing to Fleetwood Mac , writing poetry about rain drops and braiding my leg hair to form rope which I have used to construct dream catchers to sell at the local commune shop .
As the commune rejects the concept of money and only accepts happy thoughts in exchange for goods , I am writing this using my laptop powered by karma as an alternative energy source .

The Rumaila project aims to increase output at the field by 2 m barrels a day Iraq 's cabinet has ratified a deal with two foreign energy companies to develop the giant southern oilfield in Rumaila .
The contract with Britain 's BP and CNPC of China is the first major deal with foreign firms to be signed since an international auction in June .
The project aims to almost triple output at the 17bn barrel field - increasing it by 2 m barrels a day .
Iraq has the world 's third largest oil reserves , but production lags behind potential due to a lack of investment .
The country 's total daily output of 2.4 m barrels is lower than it should be due to problems stemming from sanctions against former Iraqi governments , lack of investment and insurgent attacks , analysts say .
Bidders withdraw
Thirty two companies - including Shell , Exxon , BP and Total - bid for contracts to develop six oil fields and two gas fields in June 's televised auction , Iraq 's first big oil tender since the invasion of 2003 .
Foreign companies remain wary of investing in Iraq 's energy sector
But most of the bidders withdrew at the last moment , saying the terms on offer were unfavourable .
BP and CNPC agreed to run the Rumaila field - near the southern city of Basra - after US giant Exxon Mobil turned it down .
Iraq 's oil ministry offered 20 - year service contracts on the field , stipulating that companies would not be paid anything until a minimum level of production - close to the amount currently being produced - was reached .
Above that point , the companies would be paid a certain amount per barrel up to a maximum level stipulated by the ministry .
The maximum amount being offered by the ministry in the case of the Rumaila field was significantly less than the oil companies were asking for .
Exxon Mobil declined to accept the maximum payment , but BP and CNPC , which had originally asked for $ 4 a barrel , agreed to do the work for $ 2 a barrel .
They will also be able to charge the ministry for the costs of the work they have to do on the production facilities .
Questions over approval Iraq 's oil laws are still vague and many foreign companies remain wary of investing in Iraq 's energy sector , says the BBC's Gabriel Gatehouse in Baghdad .
The Iraqi government has urged the companies involved in June 's auction to resubmit their bids .
But questions remain over who exactly has the authority to approve such contracts , our correspondent says .
Many companies fear politics could get in the way of business , especially with parliamentary elections looming in January .
BP was thrown out of Iraq in 1972 when Saddam Hussein nationalized the oil industry .
The British company will hold a 38 % stake in the venture , compared to CNPC 's 37 % share , while Iraq 's State Oil Marketing Organization will control the remaining 25 % , the Associated Press reported .
The fields up for auction in June contained about 43bn barrels of Iraq 's proven oil reserves of 115 bn barrels .

Pakistan is still counting the cost of this week 's Peshawar car bomb
At least seven paramilitary troops have been killed by a roadside bomb in north - west Pakistan , say officials .
Eleven others were said to have been injured in the blast , which struck a routine patrol of troops in the Khyber tribal region .
Elsewhere , officials said more than a dozen Islamist militants died in air strikes in the Orakzai tribal region .
The latest attacks came as fierce fighting continued in South Waziristan between the army and insurgents .
Saturday 's bomb hit a vehicle carrying troops in Sur Khar , to the east of Khyber 's main town , Landikotal , a Frontier Corps spokesman told Reuters news agency .
We are at war
Yousuf Raza Gilani
Prime Minister
Pakistan 's hidden war
Meanwhile , at least 13 insurgents died as warplanes raided suspected militant hideouts in Orakzai , said government officials .
Pakistan 's prime minister told a news conference on Saturday that the country 's leadership was united in its efforts to wipe out the Taliban .
" We are at war , " Yousuf Raza Gilani said , quoted by AP news agency .
" We do not have any other option because their [ the militants ' ] intentions are to take over , " he added .
Two weeks ago , the army launched its offensive in South Waziristan , the tribal territory separating Pakistan and Afghanistan that is widely regarded as a haven for the Taliban and al - Qaeda .
The militants have carried out retaliatory attacks across the country .
They were blamed for Wednesday 's car bomb in Peshawar that killed at least 115 people , including many women and children , but the Taliban have denied responsibility .
That blast struck during a three - day visit by US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton .
During the trip , she said it was " hard to believe " no - one in Pakistan 's government knew where al - Qaida 's leadership was hiding .
Mark Grgurich , 54 , of Des Moines was killed cycling in rural Iowa when a speeding truck slammed into him , then sped away from the scene .
Police recovered this partial logo and are asking for help identifying it .

The incident occurred Sunday , and since then Police have been tracking down any lead they can find .
This one might be the key to finding the driver of the vehicle , believed to be a white ladder truck .
It 's a partial logo broken off the truck when it hit Grgurich , and Police are hoping someone can identify it .
So what do you think ?
It 's nothing we recognize , but it could be a regional or local business logo or something custom .
Sleuth away .

Update 2 : Des Moines police have released this image of a truck captured on surveillance tape which has been identified as a suspect vehicle .
Obviously it does n't have a ladder rack on it and it's a pickup with driving lights , a grille guard and what might be either a utility bed or a dually setup on it , but it 's tough to tell .
This truck 's either a GMC or Chevrolet in the 1981 to 1987 and finding it may lead to an arrest .

Update 3 : Police have impounded a pickup truck matching the description of the vehicle in the surveillance video .
The truck was found at a towing company in Winterset , Iowa and sheriffs hauled it away after confirming it matched .
Although no suspects have yet been taken into custody , finding the vehicle places police one step closer to the perpetrator .

Solar power has hit Bill Mc­Eleney ’s pocketbook – but in a good way .
Putting solar panels on his roof was an idea that “ just rattled around ” for years , says the Cranston , R.I. , engineer , until he saw panel prices plummeting in December and decided to get off the fence .
He got a bid for a rooftop solar power system , but was delayed eight months .
Still , that delay worked to his advantage as solar - electric prices continued to fall – eventually cutting the cost of his 3.8 - kilowatt system by $ 4,000 ( from $ 32,000 to $ 28,000 ) , which allowed him to install a more powerful system .
But the deal was even sweeter overall .
A newly revamped 30 percent federal tax credit means that Mr. McEleney ’s total cash outlay will be only about $ 15,000 , compared with the $ 32,000 he was quoted eight months ago , he says .
He will still pay 15.7 cents per kilowatt - hour for any power he buys from his local power company , but his solar system will replace $ 750 of utility company power annually .
The system will pay for itself in 15 to 20 years , while insulating him from rising utility rates .
“ It ’s a good deal and it ’s maintenance - free ; you just watch the meter go backward , ” he says .
“ I ’m even kind of rooting for [ utility company ] rates to rise now . ”
Solar photovoltaic panels , which convert sunlight directly into electri­city , have long enjoyed the dubious distinction of being the most costly form of renewable power .
But now , with cheaper raw materials and a global production overcapacity , solar - panel companies are slashing prices .
It ’s a tough time to be making solar panels – but a great time to be buying them : Prices have fallen 40 to 60 percent in the past year .
With panels accounting for about half a system ’s cost , the overall price tag has fallen by up to one - third – and is still dropping , says Travis Bradford , president of the Prometheus Institute , a renewable - energy think tank .
In California , he adds , solar rooftop power is now cheaper than buying electricity from utilities , when incentives are included .
Geoff Stenrick , who sells solar panels from his SimpleRay website in St. Paul , Minn. , has been pitching “ summer blowout ” prices and “ free shipping ” on orders of more than $ 1,000 .
A 200 - watt panel that was $ 987 is now $ 689 .
That ’s $ 3.45 per watt , a 30 percent drop .
Just a year ago , $ 6 to $ 7 per watt was typical .
“ We are basically understaffed for the response we ’re getting from customers , ” Mr. Stenrick says .
“ The phone is jumping . ”
While California ’s generous incentives make it the nation ’s solar - panel hotbed , cooler parts of the US are seeing a pickup , too .
“ We ’re now at that very important place where , with tax incentives , you can actually make an economic case for homeowners to put solar on their homes , ” says Bill Kanzer , marketing director for Alteris Renewables , New England ’s largest solar installer .
“ In these key markets solar is moving from the fringe and early adopters to more of the mainstream . ”
Rising interest in solar residential electricity has as much to do with a national mind - set shift as anything else , some say .
“ You ’ve got a favorable political climate and about the best financial incentives I ’ve ever seen , ” says Richard Perez , publisher of Home Power magazine .
“ But the main reason is there ’s just more public awareness .
That ’s the key . ”

Antioxidants may raise diabetes risk
Australian researchers have found that antioxidants may increase your risk of developing diabetes in the early stages .
" In the case of early type 2 diabetes ... our studies suggest that antioxidants would be bad for you , " says Associate Professor Tony Tiganis of Monash University in Melbourne , whose study appears in the journal Cell Metabolism .
Antioxidants are protective proteins that can prevent cell damage caused by charged particles known as reactive oxygen species .
This oxidative stress is thought to add to the progression of several diseases , including type 2 diabetes .
Because antioxidants fight oxidative stress , they have become a popular food supplement .
But Tiganis says the picture appears to be a bit more complicated .
" We think there is a delicate balance , and that too much of a good thing - surprise , surprise - might be bad , " he says .
Removing protective mechanism
Tiganis ' team studied the effects of oxidative stress in mice fed a high - fat diet for 12 weeks .
One group of mice lacked an enzyme known as Gpxl , which helps counter oxidative stress .
They found mice that lacked the enzyme were less likely to develop insulin resistance - an early sign of diabetes - than normal mice .
But when they treated the enzyme - deficient mice with an antioxidant , " they lost this advantage and become more diabetic , " says Tiganis .
He says oxidative stress may be working not to damage the body , but to inhibit enzymes that hurt the body 's ability to use insulin early on in the development of diabetes , and that antioxidants remove this protective mechanism .
" Our work suggests that antioxidants may contribute to early development of insulin resistance , a key pathological hallmark of type 2 diabetes , " says Tiganis .
He cautioned that the study was in mice and more study in people is needed .
But he says other studies have suggested that antioxidants can shorten lifespan in both worms and humans .
And clinical trials in people have shown that taking antioxidants does not protect healthy people from developing diabetes .
" My belief is that individuals who are otherwise healthy should not take antioxidants , but rather eat healthy and exercise , " he says .
According to the 2004 - 05 Australian National Health Survey , 582,800 people ( approximately 3 % of the population ) reported having type 2 diabetes .
There 's nothing new about British governments spying on their own citizens .
From the time of Elizabeth I 's spy chief Francis Walsingham to the legendary agent provocateurs of the years after Waterloo to the bugging and blacklisting of the postwar decades , espionage against domestic dissenters has long been a staple of British statecraft .
For most of the last century , the secret state targeted the left , trade unionists and peace campaigners , along with Irish republicans and anyone else regarded as a " subversive " threat .
That was all supposed to have been consigned to history after the end of the cold war , when MI5 declared it had abandoned counter - subversion and switched its focus to the threat of jihadist terror attacks .
But , if anything , the apparatus of official snooping and spooking has grown even more inflated than in the days when the state faced a real political challenge from both within and without .
It 's now not just the security service and police special branch that spy on environmental campaigners and anti-war protesters , but an array of police intelligence units set up to keep tabs on those designated " domestic extremists " , including through covert informants and intercepts .
And as the Guardian 's reports of the past few days have shown , these outfits do n't just monitor activists , they work hand in glove with private companies , using anti-harassment legislation and pre-charge bail conditions , to prevent them from continuing to demonstrate and protest .
What began with injunctions against violent animal rights activists has now reached the point where hundreds of non-violent protesters are banned from going near arms factories or power stations , travelling to particular areas or even communicating with each other – without being charged with any offence .
Last year , protesters at an academy school in south London were banned by injunction from handing out leaflets or even speaking outside the premises .
The Association of Chief Police Officers , which runs the intelligence units , claims that they only target groups that break the law – for instance , by peacefully occupying a power plant or taking secondary industrial action – or operate " outside of the normal democratic process " .
In fact , Acpo is itself an unaccountable private body , while protests and demonstrations are of course an essential part of the democratic process .
" Domestic extremism " is the subversion of the new surveillance state , though without even the spurious definition the cold war term was given .
And just as MI5 used to claim it never targeted peace organisations or trade unions but the subversives within them , so the police intelligence apparatus insists it 's only interested in " extremists " , not the groups they 're part of .
The home secretary Alan Johnson this week sneered that if the police wanted to use the term " domestic extremism " he " certainly would n't fall to the floor clutching my box of Kleenex " .
But by blurring the lines between the civil and criminal law and publicly branding those who take part in demonstrations and direct action , the police and the Home Office are in effect criminalising political dissent .
That is even more true of Britain 's Muslim community , where the line the authorities are busy blurring is between political protest and terrorism .
Dozens of British Muslims are due to appear in court today charged with public order offences over the angry demonstrations against Israel 's war on Gaza in January .
Several were arrested months after the event in dawn raids by police who broke down the doors of their family homes .
In February , nine British Muslims taking part in George Galloway 's Viva Palestina aid convoy to Gaza were arrested on the motorway under the Terrorism Act .
They were eventually released without charge .
But the impact on support from the rest of the community was naturally chilling .
Last week , reports in the Guardian and by the Institute of Race Relations highlighted how the government 's £ 140 m
Prevent programme , which is supposed to mobilise Muslim community opposition to terrorism , is being used for what Liberty 's Shami Chakrabarti calls the " biggest spying programme in Britain in modern times " .
Schools , community groups and colleges are required to provide information on everything from the opinions to the sex lives of Muslims not even suspected of involvement in violence .
Underlying the abuse of the programme has been a dangerous shift in official counter - terror policy which , in parallel with the wider police surveillance of protest group , now targets " non-violent extremism " , rather than simply those who might want to launch bomb attacks on buses and tubes .
The idea is that , as Ed Husain of the government - funded Quilliam Foundation puts it , non-violent Islamists – rather than western wars in the Muslim world – provide the " mood music " for terror groups and spying on them is " good and it is right " .
In reality , both the mass surveillance and the government 's decision to widen its target from the violent to the elastic McCarthyite catch - all of " extreme " is spreading fear and mistrust , intimidating Muslims from taking part in mainstream politics and undermining the very people who can most effectively challenge those drawn towards indiscriminate violence .
Intelligence is anyway notoriously unreliable , because it cannot be properly tested as evidence – whether on the grand scale of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq or in more routine injustices , such as the 2006 raid in London 's Forest Gate , in which police shot an innocent man on the basis of groundless intelligence about a chemical bomb .
That 's one of the unwitting messages of the new official history of MI5 by the loyal historian Christopher Andrew .
While clearing a faction of the security service of having plotted against Harold Wilson , despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , Andrew gives credence to absurd claims that the pre-eminent 1970s trade union leader Jack Jones was a paid KGB agent – this on the account of the same defector who once claimed to general ridicule that the former Labour leader Michael Foot had been a Soviet agent codenamed Boot .
Which is a timely reminder of the self - serving tendency to fantasy among intelligence organisations .
Unleashing such people on those exercising their right to protest or take part in non-violent politics has got nothing to do with the defence of the democratic process – it's an assault on democracy .

The Goldstone Report is unequivocal .
It concluded :
[ T ] here is evidence indicating serious violations of international human rights and humanitarian law were committed by Israel during the Gaza conflict , and that Israel committed actions amounting to war crimes , and possibly crimes against humanity .
The report goes on to detail the evidence that leads to that conclusion .
The blockade of Gaza is itself a possible war crime .
The invasion is too .
As the UN Press Release on the report says :
[ T ]he Israeli military operation was directed at the people of Gaza as a whole , in furtherance of an overall and continuing policy aimed at punishing the Gaza population , and in a deliberate policy of disproportionate force aimed at the civilian population .
The destruction of food supply installations , water sanitation systems , concrete factories and residential houses was the result of a deliberate and systematic policy which has made the daily process of living , and dignified living , more difficult for the civilian population .
These are , in the measured tones of the report , possible war crimes or even crimes against humanity .
Goldstone is no fly by nighter .
He is a former former judge of the Constitutional Court of South Africa and former Prosecutor of the International Criminal Tribunals for the former Yugoslavia and Rwanda .
Israel predictably ignored the investigation and has done its best to rubbish and reject it .
Powerful Western supported war criminals can do that .
According to another UN Press release ‘ the Human Rights Council today strongly condemned a host of Israeli measures in the occupied Palestinian territory and called on both sides to implement the recommendations of a United Nations commission that found evidence that Israel and the Palestinians committed serious war crimes in the three - week Gaza war nine months ago . ’
This condemnation included not only the criminal blockade and subsequent invasion of Gaza but also the ongoing annexation of parts of the West Bank .
The Release said :
Much of today ’s resolution was devoted to other Israeli activities , particularly in Jerusalem , including condemnation of limits to Palestinian access to properties and holy sites based on national origin , religion , sex , age or other grounds , calling this a grave violation of the Palestinian people ’s civil , political , economic , social and cultural rights .
It condemned recent Israeli violations of human rights in occupied East Jerusalem , particularly the confiscation of lands and properties , the demolishing of houses , the construction and expansion of settlements , the continuing construction of the separation Wall built in part on land Israel occupied in the 1967 war , and the continuous digging and excavation works in and around Al - Aqsa mosque and its vicinity .
The vote to refer the issue of possible Israeli and Palestinian war crimes to the UN General Assembly was adopted by 25 votes in favour , six against , and 11 abstentions .
The United States voted against the resolution .
No major Western powers ( apart from Russia ) voted for the motion .
This is not surprising .
Israel is the outpost of US imperialism in the Middle East .
It is if you like the armed wing of US imperialism there .
Its role is to destabilise the region and allow the US to exercise control over oil and its distribution throughout the world .
Israel can if needed discipline recalcitrant nations , that is those who are not obsequious puppets of the West , or at least threaten to do so .
This means , despite Barack Obama ’s meek and mild protestations against settlements for example , that the US props up the Israeli regime with massive military and economic aid .
The US might object very occasionally when its attack dog slips off the leash , but it always rewards it for being just that , an attack dog in the interests of the US .
It is therefore no surprise that the US voted against referring the Goldstone Report to the General Assembly or to condemn Israel for it clear violations of the rights of the Palestinians in the West Bank and Gaza .
Israel cannot fulfil its role as the brutal bully in the region without first subjugating the people whose lands its has stolen , the Palestinians .
The ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians is a necessary precondition for the success of Israel ’s attack dog role .
Israel must first secure its backyard .
There is a two fold process going on – the ongoing Israeli genocide of the Palestinian people is the building block on which Israel destabilises and disciplines the whole region for US imperialism .
The slow burn of genocide against the Palestinians is disguised through an effective apartheid state in which the Jewish regime occupies Palestine but , given the very existence of the Palestinian people , creates and organises tightly controlled Bantustans in the West Bank and Gaza .
Given that the major imperialist power , and most of the imperialist Western nations , support the apartheid Israeli state , the UN will do nothing effective about the ongoing war crimes and crimes against humanity Israel commits against the Palestinian people .
The UN is the plaything of the major powers .
The Israeli occupation and annexation in effect of the West Bank and its blockade of Gaza ( reflecting the expansionist nature of the Israeli state ) are facts on the ground which destroy any possibility of a two state solution .
The only realistic long term outcome is a democratic and secular Palestine in which all who want to can live – a rainbow nation of the Middle East .
The Palestinians cannot win this .
They are not strong enough militarily or economically to challenge the Israeli killing machine .
There is one power in the Middle East that could challenge US and Israeli hegemony .
That power is the Arab working class .
It could sweep away the dictatorships ( most of them US imposed or supported ) across the region and establish real democracies of workers and peasants to run society in their interests .
Egypt , with its tens of millions of workers , its traditions of militancy , and the ongoing process of relearning those traditions , is the key .
A successful workers ’ uprising in Egypt against US puppet Mubarak would change the dynamics of the Middle East completely and challenge the grip of US imperialism and Israeli dominance .
Truly the road to Jerusalem runs through Cairo .
In 2006 , Andy Schlafly , best known as the son of notorious anti-feminist Phyllis Schlafly , launched a wiki site called Conservapedia as an alternative to Wikipedia .
The nation ’s sixth most frequently visited Web site had , he felt , become dominated by liberal and anti-Christian bias .
Now Schlafly has a new project : rewriting the Bible to free it from liberal bias .
The new translation will be free of “ emasculated ” and “ dumbed - down ” language as well as “ liberal wordiness . ”
So - called “ later - inserted liberal passages ” will be deleted entirely .
All of these changes will be made by amending the King James Version of the Bible through an online wiki format .
While the Conservative Bible Project ( CBP ) has so far been regarded largely as a joke , it does raise some interesting questions .
The idea of writing a sacred text through a wiki is largely unprecedented .
The CPB also marks an escalation in what Robert S. McElvaine has called “ Grand Theft Jesus ” — the appropriation of the Christian tradition for political ends .
Is Schlafly a profoundly cynical politician , attempting to manipulate religion in a way that would put Machiavelli and Karl Rove to shame ?
Or does he truly believe that the Bible has been tainted by “ liberalism ” for over a thousand years ?
The Jefferson Bible as Precedent
Curiously , the CBP is reminiscent of The Jefferson Bible , written in 1820 by our nation ’s third president .
Thomas Jefferson felt that the teachings of Jesus had been abused and corrupted by Christians , but that the “ genuine ” teachings of Jesus were “ as easily distinguished as diamonds in a dung - hill . ”
Jefferson removed passages referring to the supernatural , as well as what he considered to be misperceptions by the Gospel writers .
Critics accused him of paraphrasing the Bible to suit his own ends .
Is Schlafly simply a modern day Jefferson , seeking conservative diamonds in a liberal dung - hill ?
Not exactly .
The CBP differs from The Jefferson Bible in at least three respects .
First , although Jefferson used religious language in the Declaration of Independence and other writings , his revision of the Bible was a private pursuit :
He never allowed The Jefferson Bible to be published during his lifetime .
Second , Jefferson recognized that his views were highly unorthodox .
By contrast , Schlafly identifies as a practicing Catholic and argues that his reading of the Bible is , in fact , orthodox .
Finally , the nature of the revisions is fundamentally different .
The Jefferson Bible rejects supernaturalism as well as the tenets of Calvinism .
However , Schlafly ’s projects — Conservapedia and the CBP — do not seek to combat specific ideologies so much as a species called “ liberals . ”
Conservapedia defines a “ liberal ” as “ someone who rejects logical and biblical standards , often for self - centered reasons . ”
In this world , liberals are incapable of understanding the Bible , or even logical thought .
Where Jefferson excluded doctrines from his Bible , the CBP seeks to exclude words .
“ Accountability , ” for instance , is a conservative word that enriches understanding of scripture .
“ Laborer , ” on the other hand , is a liberal word and has no place in the Bible .
“ Young girl ” ?
How about “ floozy , ” “ bimbo , ” or “ temptress ” ?
So how is the new translation proceeding ?
As of October 11 , the completed “ translations ” on Conservapedia include Mark 1 - 8 , Matthew 1 - 9 , Luke 1 - 2 , John 1 - 3 , Philemon , and a few verses from Genesis , 1 John , Jude , and 1 and 2 Thessalonians .
As for the Hebrew Bible , only Genesis appears to be slated for translation .
Calling the works in question “ translations ” may be a misnomer since work with Greek originals seems to be intermittent at best .
For the most part , the changes are simply re-phrasings of passages from the King James Version .
Where commentary has been made on the Greek , it typically reflects a rudimentary and sometimes distorted understanding of the language .
For example , the only mention of any Greek in the translation of the Gospel of Mark 1 - 8 comes in verse 6:22 , where the “ translators ” have argued that korasion , which means “ young girl ” or “ maiden , ” should be translated as “ floozy , ” “ bimbo , ” or “ temptress ” — despite the fact that this translation has no historical , philological , or textual basis .
In fact , Mark uses the same word in 5:41 , in reference to a young girl whom Jesus raises from the dead .
Such an open approach to translation will likely offend conservative and fundamentalist proponents of “ biblical inerrancy , ” the theory that the Bible is God ’s inspired word and that only the literal meaning of the text is valid .
Some comments on the talk pages for the project already reflect a tension among conservative readers along these lines , with the critics referring , for example , to Revelation 22:19 ’s injunction not to “ take away from the words of the book of this prophecy . ”
One comment from the blogosphere said of the CBP , “ Let them rewrite the Bible .
It is deemed a sin to add or take away from the Good Book , so those wanting to rewrite will find their own brimstone and hellfire soon enough . ”
In their interpretive procedures and principles , however , participants in the CBP do not reject biblical inerrantist or originalist rhetoric .
On the contrary , they see themselves as restoring the text to its original state .
The project ’s authors maintain , for example , that there are three “ sources of error ” in modern translations of the Bible .
Along with bias in modern translations and the “ lack of precision in the modern language , ” they point to the inadequacy of the original language of the texts in rendering the “ powerful new concepts ” introduced by Christianity .
This can result in the somewhat paradoxical claim that the meaning of the text is insufficient to convey its clear meaning .
Hence , for instance , the following conversation between a critical commentator , who takes issue with the historical and philological accuracy of the translation of “ korasion , ” and Andy Schlafly :
The trouble with that example is , we already know what “ κορα σ ι ω ν ” means — it means “ little girl , ” the diminutive of the bog- standard Greek word for girl , κοραι .
And we know that because people used it on funerary inscriptions ( among others ) to describe their dead daughters , who they ( presumably ) did n’t want to call temptresses .
Ancient Greek had a rich , complex vocabulary , including a complete vocabulary of sexual terms — they had words for temptress , slut , prostitute , dancer , etc .
The author of the Gospel of Mark chose to use the word that unequivocally means “ little girl ” instead of one of the many less savory words he had available , and yet you think you know better what he meant to say ?
That ’s not creating an unbiased translation , that ’s shoehorning your own belief structure into the Bible .
Does that honor God ?
— Jere7 my 20:41 , 6 October 2009 ( EDT )
Fine , κορα σι ων means “ little girl , ” but that obviously does not fit the context of the story .
What is missing from your analysis is that Mark himself was a young boy at the time also .
The underlying event was almost certainly a provocative dance by a young woman , and the best translation should reflect the obvious truth .
Fisherman Mark may not have been familiar with the “ rich , complex ” Greek vocabulary to which you allude , and we ’re not about to change the Greek term Mark used .
But let the finest English be used to convey the likely meaning accurately .
— Andy Schlafly 22:33 , 6 October 2009 ( EDT )
Since the text does not say that the dance was provocative , Schlafly ’s argument that the author ’s intended meaning is “ obvious ” begs the question , “ obvious to whom ? ”
On the talk page , one contributor offers an answer , of sorts , to this question : “ THE BIBLE IS CONSERVATIVE , ” he writes , and , as such , “ conservatives ” will know what it originally meant .
Pharisee = Liberal
Whether or not Biblical inerrantists accept the idea that Andy Schlafly and other like - minded individuals are the true guardians of the original meaning , the CBP is sure to strike historically - minded scholars and readers as problematic .
In addition to making unfounded claims about the author of the gospel of Mark ’s feelings about young girls , the translators maintain that “ unclean spirit ” should be translated as “ Satan , ” that “ cast lots , ” should be translated as “ gambling , ” that “ holy spirit , ” should be translated “ divine guide , ” and that logos , or “ word , ” should be translated “ truth . ”
Some of the translators have even suggested that the title “ Pharisee ” should be translated as “ elite , ” “ self - proclaimed elite , ” “ intellectual , ” or “ liberal . ”
On the main page of the project , the guidelines suggest that translations should insist on the “ logic of Hell … as in not denying or downplaying the very real existence of Hell , ” ignoring the fact that the modern concept of Hell is a post - biblical conflation of motifs from a number of sometimes conflicting biblical and apocryphal notions of sheol , gehenna , Hades , judgment in the end - times , etc .
More starkly anachronistic are claims that Jesus taught parables about the “ free market ” ( a late - medieval concept at best ) , and that the Bible includes “ later - inserted liberal passages . ”
In describing the project , Schlafly has repeatedly cited two such “ liberal ” passages : the story of Jesus saving an adulteress from being stoned in John 7:53 - 8:11 , and Luke 23:34 , where Jesus asks God to forgive his crucifiers , “ for they know not what they do . ”
Schlafly is right to point out that neither passage is unanimously attested by the earliest ancient manuscripts .
Many people do n’t realize that the New Testament that they can read today ( in the NIV or KJV , for example ) is actually based on a collation of diverse ancient texts .
During the course of copying and transmitting the gospels , Acts , letters , and Revelations throughout antiquity , scribes made small errors and “ corrections , ” including additions to and subtractions from the texts that they copied , resulting in sometimes markedly different versions of what are now well - known passages .
In addition to Luke 23:34 and John 7:53 - 8:11 , other famously disputed passages include the “ only - begotten God ” or “ only - begotten son ” of John 1:18 , the “ bloody sweat ” of Luke 22:43 - 44 , the number six hundred sixty - six in Revelation 13 , and 1 Corinthians 14:34 -35 ( which enjoins women to be silent in church ) .
One of the main reasons for differences between newer translations of the Bible and the KJV is that the latter does not consistently reflect what scholars now believe to be the earliest and best ancient manuscripts .
Conservative Christian groups usually oppose text - critical analysis of the manuscripts that make up the New Testament , so it is somewhat surprising that the CBP has embraced it .
It ’s all Greek to Him
Still , Schlafly ’s belief that “ liberals ” added John 7:53 - 8:11 and Luke 23:34 to the Bible is manifestly ludicrous from a historical point of view .
Both texts are already attested by manuscripts in the fourth century , long before modern liberals — or conservatives — were around to pen them .
A history of reception of either passage would undoubtedly show that , like every other Bible passage , they have been used by a variety of different groups with different interests in different times and places over the last seventeen centuries or so .
Here , as elsewhere , Schlafly displays a remarkable lack of historical knowledge about the Bible for someone who has undertaken to oversee a Bible translation project .
He does not appear to personally know any relevant ancient languages , or even what ancient languages make up the Bible .
When one commentator on the talk page suggested that the translators should “ go back to the Hebrew , Greek , Aramaic etc. , ” in translating the Hebrew Bible and New Testament , for example , Schlafly retorted that the Bible was written in Greek , adding that the commentator seemed “ unsure in identifying the original language . ”
Even leaving aside the question of historical or linguistic accuracy , however , this project presents serious problems for those scholars , ministers , and lay - people concerned with the ethics of intepretation .
One would have to question the grounds of understanding young girls to be “ temptresses ” or “ bimbos , ” for example , or of excising a passage in which Jesus defends a woman from being stoned to death for adultery because it is too “ liberal . ”
The CBP ’s approach stands in stark opposition to that of feminist and other exegetes who have sought to reconsider possible readings of the text on ethical grounds .
Such interpreters have typically rejected the positivist search for a unique , original meaning while maintaining a strong degree of philological and historical - critical rigor in their development of ethical interpretations .
The members of the Conservative Bible project have moved precisely in the opposite direction , insisting that they are restoring the original , authentic meaning without having any historical , linguistic , or ethical justifications for their interpretive choices .
The Future of Wiki Translation
Nevertheless , the content of the translations may well change over time , due to the nature of a wiki project .
It is conceivable that more knowledgeable readers of the Bible will ultimately contribute to the translation .
Already , on the talk page for the project ’s home page , certain critical , but sympathetic , commentators have questioned the CBP ’s approach to “ later inserted liberal texts ” on text - critical grounds .
In the translation of Mark , some critical contributors appear to have won out in arguing that Pharisee should be “ translated ” as Pharisee , rather than being changed to “ intellectual , ” “ liberal , ” or “ elite . ”
Assuming the editors and contributors respond to such criticisms , the CBP ’s transformation could prove interesting for tracing the evolution of a wiki “ translation ” project of the Bible ; it might even wind up , in the far - off future , being the medium for a sophisticated , conservatively - oriented version of the Bible .
Whether it does or not , however , the use of wiki technology suggests a new , and potentially more democratic , medium for other translation projects .
The CBP could act as a model for any of those communities , Christian or otherwise , who feel that their interests are not sufficiently represented by current editions of the Bible .
One could easily imagine anarchist or Satanist “ translations ” of the Bible , or sophisticated translations of the Bible by groups who have been marginalized by mainstream Christianity .
It could also act as a model for forms of literary experimentation , for a “ translation ” of biblical texts into the genres of science fiction or fantasy , for instance .
As it stands right now , the only other wiki Bible translation project of which we are aware ( which preceded the CBP by a few years , and which follows the same practice of rephrasing modern , English editions of the Bible ) is the LOLCAT Bible Translation Project , which aims to translate scripture into “ lolspeak ” or “ Kitty Pidgin English . ”
Ceiling Cat would no doubt approve .
You think it 's about greenhouse gases .
You think it 's about carbon emissions .
And it is .
But the Copenhagen agreement on climate change that the world community will attempt to sign in December is just as much about money – enormous , mind - boggling amounts of money .
In brutally simplistic terms , the essence of any deal will be to pay the developing countries of the world , led by China and India , to cut back on the carbon dioxide pouring out of their now - mushrooming economies , which will come to represent 90 per cent of all future emissions growth , and the inducement for them to do this will have to be substantial .
It has hardly dawned on the general public just how big are the sums of cash that the developing world is seeking , and that the rich world will have to go some way towards providing , if the vital pathway to keeping global temperature rises below C is to be mapped out .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
But they are truly colossal , and the gap between the potential donor countries and the recipients may be unbridgeable ; it is finance , rather than the setting of emissions targets , which is more likely to be the deal - breaker in Copenhagen .
Ever since the first UN global warming treaty was signed in 1992 , the rich nations have accepted that they have a special responsibility over climate , as we caused the problem in the first place – most of the CO2 that has gone into atmosphere has been put there by 200 years of western industrialisation .
Now we are asking China and its colleagues in the G77 group of poorer nations to grow – and so bring their people out of poverty – in a different low - carbon way from the way in which we grew , which is difficult and expensive ; do as we say , not do as we did .
And it is accepted on all sides that if they are to do this , we must help them .
They need help for two essential tasks , which in the jargon are mitigation and adaptation .
Mitigation means cutting back on carbon emissions , by substituting renewable energy projects , say , for coal - burning power stations ; adaptation means coping with climate change which is now unavoidable , such as building enhanced flood relief schemes to deal with the threat of climate - change - induced sea - level rise .
It is obvious that all of this will be costly .
Just how costly the developing world thought it would be became clear at the end of August , when the G77 - plus - China , as the nations are collectively known , put forward a formal proposal for financing a new climate agreement .
Their " enhanced financial mechanism " suggested that the rich countries should pay between 0.5 and 1 per cent of their gross national product every year .
For the European Union , this would be between $ 90bn ( £ 55 bn ) and $ 180bn annually ; for the US , between $ 70bn and $ 140bn ; for Britain alone , between $ 13bn and $ 26bn .
The full total would be between $ 200bn and $ 400bn , a range from nearly double to nearly four times the amount of all current overseas aid flows .
Moreover , it would have to be on top of existing aid , the developing countries said – it must be " new and additional " , above all current overseas development assistance .
There have been no negotiations about this , because that figure has lain on the table for two months without any of the rich countries responding .
But on Friday , at last , the European Union became the first rich - country bloc to come up with its own financial proposals .
The EU thinks that the full amount of extra public money needed to pay for climate change in the developed world is € 22bn to € 50bn annually , depending on what actions the poorer countries undertake ( the sum is nearly the same in pounds sterling ; in dollars it is about $ 32bn to $ 72bn ) .
Europe would probably end up paying about 20 to 30 per cent of this , perhaps € 5bn to € 12bn , of which Britain itself would probably pay about € 1bn .
The full regime would be in place by 2020 , with lesser sums coming earlier .
The key point about these figures is that they are a start ; they allow officials from the 192 countries involved in the treaty , including Britain , at last to start talking about money from today , when the final week of pre-Copenhagen negotiations begins in Barcelona .
Oxfam recognised this at the weekend , even while protesting that the level was too low – the charity thinks that more than double the public finance is required .
" Finally coming forward with numbers is a positive step but the proposed figure falls well short of the € 110bn needed to help poor countries adapt to climate change and curb their carbon emissions , " said Robert Bailey , Oxfam 's Senior Policy Advisor on climate change .
And , indeed , getting the 27 EU members states to agree at all – some , such as Poland , being very reluctant – was a considerable achievement , for which much of the credit must go to Gordon Brown , who has been pushing hard for an EU deal for months .
The EU sums will be the ballpark figures to which other rich nations , the US above all , must now react .
But will they be enough to secure a deal ?
The quickest glance will show that the EU 's top sum is only a third of the developing countries ' lowest figure .
Is that gap bridgeable in negotiations ?
Perhaps .
It is not the only problem looming .
A condition of the EU offer is " universality " – meaning that some of the richer developing countries , such as China and India , will have to contribute to the fund themselves , even if they end up net beneficiaries of it .
They will not like that .
But most of all , there is no cast - iron guarantee that the finance will be entirely " new and additional " on top of current aid flows , and the poorer countries fear their development aid may be cut to provide their climate funding .

October 21 , 2009 — Mario Gleichmann
As a kid , i loved to play with Lego bricks , especially to build freaky spacecrafts .
At that time it was easy to let my phantasy go ( where noone has gone before ) and build completely new models simply by composing some standard bricks .
Those bricks were n’t too specialized , meaning that there were n’t too many constraints on how to combine them .
On the other side you always had to compose a new spacecraft from the very ground up as there were n’t some more higher organized units like engines or control cabins .
Nowadays , you ’ll find such units .
There are engines , control cabins or a whole commando bridge , Wings , Field Generators and so on – a whole set of higher organized units whithin a single domain .
On the other side , you ca n’t combine every unit with an arbitrary other unit within that domain since there are some ‘ constraints ’ that will prohibit some unsound combinations .
Now you may ask how that cute childhood story relates to Scala ?
You may have seen already some similarities to the field of software development where you also want to compose some higher organized building blocks within a certain domain , enforcing that they are only combined in a proper way .
It turns out , that Scala ’s concept of traits provide some mechanisms of ‘ mixin ’ them together while enforcing the compliance of some constraints .
This may sound too abstract at that point , but hold on – we ’ll build some spacecrafts in the above mentioned way and things will get clearer .
Look , it ’s a spacecraft
Let ’s start with a hull for our spacecraft .
To keep things simple and to focus on the core idea of constrained
composition , the spacecraft ’s hull will only provide one abstract method engange to start the craft :
abstract class Spacecraft{ def engage }
As you can see , method engage and therefore the whole class is abstract , so you ca n’t instantiate a pure hull
of a spacecaft .
So whenever we want to build a full fledged craft , we may have to ‘ add ’ ( or mix in ) a component
that knows how to engage that craft .
Captains place
Typically , a spacecraft possess a kind of ‘ control center ’ which is normally well suited for initiating the
start of a craft , hence should provide an implementation for method engage .
There may be different kinds of
control centers that could be used for building your own , customized spacecraft – e.g. a whole commando bridge for
those big deep space crafts or a small control cabin for those little crafts mainly maneuvering near the orbit .
trait CommandoBridge{ def engage { for ( _ <- 1 to 3 ) { speedUp } } def speedUp }
Now we see what it means to engage ( a Spacecraft ) if composing a commando Bridge to the hull .
We simply speed up that craft 3 times .
But hold on – although we know what it means to engage that craft , speeding up that craft is not in the responsibility of the commando bridge , since speedUp is left abstract ( speeding down is omitted since it follows the same mechanism – you get the idea ) .
Re-calibrating all Dilithium crystals
So the spacecraft seems to be incomplete without a unit to speed it up – let ’s call such a unit ‘ engine ’ .
Again , there may be different kinds of engines we could select from to assemble our craft .
Let ’s say there is a Pulse - Engine that directly supports the command of speeding up :
trait PulseEngine{ val maxPulse : Int var currentPulse = 0 ; def speedUp { if ( currentPulse < maxPulse ) currentPulse += 1 } }
As you can see , a PulseEngine is able to speed up until a maximum pulse rate .
In order to ‘ produce ’ different pulse engines ( supporting different maximum pulse rates for different types of crafts ) , the field is again left abstract .
Now we could create our first spacecraft , using a commando bridge and a pulse engine ( let ’s say that ’s all you need for building a full fledged spacecraft ) .
class StarCruiser extends Spacecraft with CommandoBridge with PulseEngine{ val maxPulse = 200 }
As you can see , we ’ve created a new ( Sub - ) Type of a spacecraft and mixed in both Traits , obtaining a commando bridge ( that knows how to engage the whole craft ) and an engine ( that knows how to get the craft into speed when engaging the craft ) .
The only thing left is to define the maximum pulse rate our StarCruiser is able to achieve .
Wiring
In the above case , all units fitted together smoothly .
For example , a pulse engine provided exactly the ‘ interface ’ ( speedUp ) that was needed by a commando bridge , so you could compose both without additional work .
Let ’s take a look at another control center , that we could apply to our craft , that may offer an incompatible ‘ interface ’ :
trait ControlCabin{ def engage = increaseSpeed def increaseSpeed }
This time we need to do some additional wiring , if we want to compose a new type of craft using a control cabin and a pulse engine , since both units do n’t fit together directly ( the dependency needed by ControlCabin ( increaseSpeed ) is n’t directly fulfilled by PulseEngine )
class Shuttle extends Spacecraft with ControlCabin with PulseEngine{ val maxPulse = 10 def increaseSpeed = speedUp }
As you can see , we have to wire together the control cabin with the pulse engine in order to let them cooperate .
In the same way , we could think of another kind of engine which offers a completely different ‘ interface ’ :
trait WarpEngine extends Engine{ val maxWarp : Int var currentWarp = 0 ; def toWarp ( x : Int ) { if ( x < maxWarp ) currentWarp = x } }
Again , we need to wire together the concrete control center with the WarpEngine , depending on their incompatible ‘ interfaces ’ .
Let ’s compose a craft , using a commando bridge and a warp engine .
Firstly , we are forced to define a maximum warp level , since it ’s an abstract field of WarpEngine .
Secondly we have to wire together the commando bridge with the warp engine , that is to ‘ route ’ the commando bridge ’s method speedUp to the warp engines ‘ interface ’ toWarp with an appropriate implementation :
class Explorer extends Spacecraft with CommandoBridge with WarpEngine{ val maxWarp = 10 def speedUp = toWarp ( currentWarp + 1 ) }
Alternatively , we could also use a simple control cabin for another type of spacecraft .
Again we have to link the contol cabins commands ( increaseSpeed ) to the warp engines ‘ interface ’ :
object Defiant extends Spacecraft with ControlCabin with WarpEngine{ val maxWarp = 20 // claimed by WarpEngine def increaseSpeed = toWarp ( 10 ) // claimed by ControlCabin }
Restricted Access
Until now , we only applied a control center or engines to spacecrafts .
But nothing would restrict us to use those units in other domains so far .
Say we want to build a certain airplane and apply a warp engine .
class Jet extends Airplane with WarpEngine{ val maxWarp = 5 }
It ’s propably not the best idea to equip a Jet with a warp engine , since this seems to be a bit oversized for an airplane .
We need a way to restrict the usage of warp engines – they should be only applied to spacecrafts .
Fortunately we can express this kind of constraint , using Scala ’s self type annotation .
Included within a trait , it ’s like saying ‘ this trait is only allowed to be mixed into a type of x ‘ ( in our case ‘ Spacecraft ‘ ) :
trait WarpEngine extends Engine{ this : Spacecraft => ... }
As you can see , we used the WarpEngines self type to restrict its appliance only to spacecrafts .
In all other cases , Scala ’s compiler will complain about an unsound mixin .
What makes a spacecraft a spacecaft ?
With selftypes , we now have an instrument to restrict the usage of a trait to be mixed in only to a certain Type .
On the other side , we are n’t forced to use a control center or an engine at all if creating a new spacecraft , since we could provide an implementation of the spacecrafts abstract methods directly within a subtype .
That may be fine in some cases , but what if we want to state that a spacecraft has to be composed of at least a certain type of control center and a certain type of engine ?
Again , we can use the service of the self type annotation , this time applied to our abstract class spacecraft , stating that a spacecraft should at least be compound of a control center and an engine :
abstract class Spacecraft{ this : ControlCenter with Engine => ... }
The only thing left is to provide an appropriate type ControlCenter resp .
Engine and the correct classification of those concrete units ( e.g. ‘ CommandoBridge is a ControlCenter ‘ )
trait ControlCenter trait CommandoBridge extends ControlCenter{ ... } trait ControlCabin extends ControlCenter{ ... } trait Engine trait PulseEngine extends Engine{ ... } trait WarpEngine extends Engine{ ... }
Summary
Abstract methods and self type annotations are two powerful tools which help to guide or constrain the composition of traits .
You may use abstract methods and abstract fields to enforce a kind of ‘ wiring ’ between multiple units or at least to force the definition of some concrete information .
You may use a self type annotation to restrict the appliance of a trait , so that it can only be mixed in to a certain type ( or subtypes ) .
On the other side , you ’re able to enforce that a certain trait ( or subtype ) have to be mixed in to a certain type , again by using a self type annotation .
In all cases , the ‘ composer ’ of those units will be guided by the compiler – you ca n’t forget to give a definition for an abstract method or arrange an unsound composition , since all those ‘ constraints ’ are based on Scala ’s statically typed Type system .

Canadian flag
Details emerged on Tuesday that the Canadian military hosted the first gay military marriage in North America at an airbase in Nova Scotia in May .
A sergeant and a warrant officer , who did n't want to be identified , were married on May 3 by a United Church minister in front of about 45 guests at Greenwood airbase .
Lt. Cmdr David Greenwood , the base 's Anglican chaplain , said he could not officiate but said he arranged the service and preached at the wedding .
Greenwood said the wedding might encourage other gays and lesbians to come forward and make their vows official .
Most Anglican dioceses in Canada do n't perform same - sex marriages , but has postponed its official decision on the matter until 2007 .
A National Defence spokeswoman confirmed this was the first gay wedding in the military 's history .
Currently , same - sex marriages are recognized and performed in seven provinces and one territory across Canada .
In 2004 , the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that the federal government has exclusive jurisdiction to decide who has the right to marry in Canada .
Prime Minister Paul Martin said the government would pursue legalizing same - sex marriage across the country this year .
The government 's same - sex marriage bill passed its second reading in the House of Commons in May .

SOLD OUT
AWARTA and SUSYA , West Bank —
The olive branch may be a universal symbol for peace , but in the West Bank , the olive harvest brings a season of unrest between Jewish settlers and Palestinians .
It owes much to proximity .
Small communities of Israelis living in the West Bank are within areas typically closed off to Palestinians .
In some parts of the West Bank , the settlement security boundaries run directly through Palestinians ' olive groves .
In some areas , the trees are fenced in by these dividers , and in other areas , they lie just outside .
Many farmers said they are too fearful to harvest without protection .
In 2006 , the Israeli Supreme Court , in response to a series of violent attacks by settlers , ruled that the army must do more to protect Palestinians during the harvest .
As a result , the Israeli army now announces the days it will be patrolling in each area to protect Palestinians as they move closer to the settlement boundaries .
Rabbi Yehiel Grenimann , an activist from Rabbis for Human Rights , said that the smaller — and often more radical — settlements are threatened by peace negotiations and the talk of removing them .
Some settlers have been reacting with acts of vandalism to discourage Palestinians from harvesting their olives , in light of a law left over from the Ottoman Empire stating that any land not worked after a period of three years is considered to be state land .
“ The settlers know that many people here do n’t have papers [ from Israeli courts affirming official ownership of the trees ] and that the land is ancestral , ” Grenimann said .
“ So if Palestinians can be shooed away from an area where there might be an olive tree or two … because it ’s very sparse around here [ in Susya ] ... then eventually if land is declared state land , it might be handed over to the settlers . ”
In an act of vandalism before the harvest , settlers recently burned about 200 trees near the fence bordering the settlement of Itamar , near Nablus , and along the main road of the neighboring Palestinian village of Awarta , according to the town 's Deputy Mayor Hani Darousha .
Darousha said the loss of the olive trees was particularly painful because of their special place in Palestinian culture and the amount of time it took for them to grow .
“ When you plant a tree , it ’s like growing a child , ” Darousha said .

At the core of a congressional push to audit the Federal Reserve are activists with a larger purpose : to abolish the central bank .
Thousands of Americans are joining protests and lobbying their lawmakers in pursuit of the ultimate goal of replacing the Fed with a money system backed by gold or other commodities .
Largely inspired by Rep. Ron ...
At long last there is a comic !
Any delays were caused by Wes wandering a post - apocalyptic wasteland while Tony was breaking his friend out of jail .
At Twincoz Bar , the clinking of beer bottles and the usual chorus of tusayukire wamu ( cheers ) has been deadened by a mournful mumble .
Around the plastic tables of the roadside joint on the outskirts of Kampala , patrons talk of the scourge of sudden blindness followed by death .
In the past month , at least 40 Ugandans have died from drinking adulterated alcohol .
In this unregulated east African country , believed to have the world 's highest rate of alcohol consumption , the news is terrifying .
The authorities appear helpless .
Worst of all , no one seems safe .
" Since the death of DJ Ronnie , we know it can happen to anyone , " said Twincoz owner Ruben Mugyeni .
On 11 September , less than 24 hours after a night out with friends , popular radio presenter Ronnie Sempangi , 36 , lost his sight , went into a coma and died from multiple organ failure .
The late - night lonely - hearts presenter is thought to have unwittingly drunk lethal methanol .
As one of the most - loved personalities in Uganda , thousands attended his funeral at Nanziga near Kampala .

" DJ Ronnie used to drink here , in Nansana neighbourhood , " said Mr Mugyeni .
" We usually associate the dangerous artisanal waragi [ spirit ] with the rural areas .
Ronnie drank Johnnie Walker , not that stuff .
Or so everyone thought . "
Kampala is one of the party capitals of Africa .
Its streets are lined with a variety of unlicensed drinking joints – known as kafunda – where it is possible to drink virtually around the clock .
Lax licensing enforcement means sachets of waragi – the word used for any alcohol spirit – are easier and cheaper to buy than mobile phone top-ups .
Vendors patrol the bars selling nyama choma ( grilled meat ) , and men and women gather good - naturedly beneath television screens blasting out Big Brother Africa or the British Premier League .
There is no fighting or obvious binge drinking .
There is also no debate about the impact of alcohol in a country where people profess to drink " from Monday to Monday " .
" Consumption of alcohol is culturally and socially acceptable , " said Nick Henderson , a Briton who is managing director of Nile Breweries .
" Uganda 's economy is agro-based , with a tradition of local brewing and distilling using sorghum , millet , maize , sugar , bananas and pineapples .
The spate of deaths is attributed to high concentrations of methanol in local spirits , due to poor distilling or adulteration with industrial alcohol .
There is a need for the government to address the very low prices of these spirits , " he said .
In 2004 and 2005 , two United Nations reports listed Uganda as having the highest per capita consumption of absolute alcohol in the world .
Its score of 19.5 litres put it ahead of duty - free haven Luxembourg and of the Pilsener - swigging Czech Republic .
But the World Food Organisation pointed out that 53 per cent of alcohol consumed by Ugandans was informally produced .
When asked whether alcohol leads to social and health problems , most Ugandans look utterly puzzled .
Yet the country has among the highest rate of road fatalities in the world and the government is currently running an aggressive campaign to reduce domestic violence .
But alcohol is not mentioned as a cause of problems .
Brewing and distilling are deeply rooted in rural culture , where they are carried out by women and provide crucial income .
The expression used for " cheers " in Kampala actually means " let us rejoice together " .
Ugandans are proud to tell the story of how the British empire 's " war gin " for the troops was corrupted into the word waragi to mean any spirit , either branded or locally produced .
Access to alcohol is almost considered a basic freedom , as with guns in the US .
Politicians tamper with it at their peril .
In response to the poisonings , the health ministry asked parliament for an immediate ban on alcohol in sachets , but MPs voted against it .
The two large alcohol companies – Nile Breweries , which does not produce spirits , and Uganda Breweries , which does – find themselves in the unusual position of pressing government for more regulation .

Sandor Walusimbi , head of corporate relations at Uganda Breweries , is critical of knee - jerk prohibitionist tendencies in Yoweri Museveni 's government .
" We manufacture Uganda Waringi which is an iconic gin , sold both in sachets and bottles , " he said .
" Before the poisonings , the government had announced a ban , effective from next year , on sachets .
The decision was centred on environmental concerns and we were happy to comply , as they were giving us time to sell off our stocks .
But he added : " The immediate ban attempted in parliament last week was no solution .
Our products , which include whisky in sachets , are triple distilled and 100 per cent safe .
To ban all sachets would only push low - income consumers into the informal sector . "
Poverty is the key problem .
Mr Henderson , whose company produces Nile Lager with water drawn from the source of the river , agrees .
" While per capita consumption of alcohol is relatively high , Ugandans drink only 6 litres of beer per year , compared to the Czechs ' 160 litres .
Beer is too expensive for the majority of consumers . "
At Twincoz bar , patrons will sit for hours around a single bottle of Bell or Tusker beer , for which they have paid up to 2,500 shillings ( 80 p ) .
A sachet of Uganda Waragi sells for 600 shillings ( 19 p ) .
Sachet waragi from the informal sector can be found for as little as 200 shillings .
Yet the government 's only weapon so far has been taxation , creating a mood that Mr Henderson compares to 1920s American prohibitionism .
Uganda and Nile Breweries are Uganda 's top tax payers .
Eight years ago the government briefly pushed excise duty on beer to 70 per cent .
" The use of taxes , coupled with strict licensing laws , do not work .
High taxation shifts consumers to higher - strength liquor , " said Mr Henderson .
With no considered government policy in place , nor any enforced control of advertising or sales , it falls to the breweries to manage campaigns such as those against drink driving .
These are inevitably less effective than a government scheme .
But pure business sense has also enticed the breweries to appeal to the low - income market .
Uganda Breweries has developed Senator , a lager brewed from locally grown barley and sold for 1,200 shillings ( 37 p ) .
Nile Breweries ' answer , Eagle , is a runaway success made from local sorghum .
The use of local ingredients allowed the breweries to argue for a 20 per cent excise duty .
But at Twincoz Bar drinkers say the situation has left them frightened and confused .
" Last year , 200 people died in Kenya from drinking a poisonous waragi called Kill Me Quick , " said Joseph Mugisha .
" I think the same thing is going to happen here .
We are receiving no information .
We heard the sachets had been banned but you can buy them everywhere . "
Everyone knows the story of DJ Ronnie 's last night out .
He is said to have been drinking Johnnie Walker whisky in one of Nansana 's many bars .
When the whisky ran out , he asked for " just anything – whatever there is " .
The next day , he was dead .
Mr Mugisha said that for the time being , he would stick to lager , adding : " But I do n't see Ugandans giving up their waragi .
It is part of life . "
Italian media unions organised the mass rally
Tens of thousands of Italians have protested in Rome against what they say are threats to press freedom by Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi .
They say his decision to sue newspapers for their coverage of alleged scandals involving young women reveals his contempt for free speech .
Demonstrators also allege Mr Berlusconi has too much control over the media .
Mr Berlusconi called the protest a farce , saying press freedom was greater in Italy than any other Western nation .
Organisers said more than 300,000 people took part in the protest in Rome 's central Piazza del Popolo , although city officials put the figure at nearer 60,000 .
Slogans
" Berlusconi is bad for Italy 's health , " read one banner , while a slogan on some protesters ' T - shirts said : " Now you can sue me too " .
" We ask the prime minister to stop the campaign of accusations against journalists and to tell the truth , " Franco Siddi , head of the Italian Press Federation , told the rally .
Prime Minister Silvio Berlusconi dismissed the protest as a farce
The BBC's Duncan Kennedy in Rome says concerns about Mr Berlusconi 's influence on Italian media are not new but reaction to it on the scale of Saturday 's protest is .
In August , the prime minister launched legal action against media outlets across Europe for their coverage of his private life .
Mr Berlusconi , who owns three of Italy 's seven free - to - air TV channels , has also urged businessmen to stop placing ads in newspapers and magazines that attack him .
His critics say he also exerts considerable influence over state television RAI .
In its 2009 survey , media research group Freedom House downgraded Italy to the " partly free " category and placed it 73rd out of 195 .
Press freedom watchdog Reporters Without Borders , which publishes its own survey this month , says Italy is faring worse than any other EU country .

In Massachusetts , if the police desire to charge you with a misdemeanor that was allegedly committed outside their presence , they cannot arrest you ( with the notable exceptions of domestic violence cases , including spousal assault and battery and / or violation of a restraining order ) .
Instead , the police must apply for a complaint at the local district or municipal court .
You would then be entitled to a clerk magistrate 's hearing — or , a clerk 's hearing , for short .
The stakes at a clerk 's hearing are quite high : if a complaint issues against you , the charge will appear on your criminal record and therefore would be part of any future background check .
On the other hand , if a complaint does not issue against you , there is no public record of it — and it would be as if the charge never happened at all .
Needless to say , a clerk 's hearing is a terrific opportunity for you to keep your record clean .
Attorney David R. Yannetti and his legal team represent clients facing misdemeanor and felony criminal charges at a clerk 's hearing .
If you hire the Yannetti Criminal Defense Law Firm at this early juncture , our attorneys would evaluate your case , possibly contact the arresting officer and / or police prosecutor , speak with witnesses , and prepare arguments to convince the clerk magistrate to dismiss the application for complaint against you .
As former prosecutors , our criminal defense experts understand how to work effectively with law enforcement officers and alleged victims in order to prevent charges from issuing against our clients .

What Happens At A Clerk 's Hearing ?
Typically , the arresting officer will appear in court to read a report or describe for the clerk magistrate what happened in your arrest .
Sometimes , the arresting officer does not appear , and instead leaves it to a police prosecutor to represent the department .
In some cases , witnesses may appear as well in order to provide testimony .
As the defendant , you may bring an attorney to represent you .
The proceedings are usually not recorded and there is usually no public record of what transpires in a clerk 's hearing .
Based upon your attorney 's advice , you may or may not choose to testify on your own behalf .
In the end , the clerk magistrate will consider the testimony and exhibits , while entertaining oral arguments from the police officer and your attorney .
If the clerk magistrate finds that there is probable cause to support the charges -- and if he or she also believes that you should be charged -- then a complaint will issue against you .
If , on the other hand , your attorney can convince the clerk magistrate that there are good reasons to dismiss the case , then your criminal record will remain clean .
Why Should I Hire A Defense Attorney ?
Only an attorney who understands how police officers and clerk magistrates tend to view certain cases can truly lobby effectively on your behalf .
Depending on your criminal record and the circumstances of your arrest , Attorney Yannetti may be able to reach out to an officer or alleged victim and convince him or her to recommend that the charges against you be dismissed .
There may also be a legal basis to prevent a complaint from issuing .
The danger for an unrepresented defendant is his or her ignorance of both the legal and practical aspects to a clerk 's hearing .
You may think that you are acting in a proper manner , while you are instead helping to convince a clerk magistrate that you should be charged after all .
In many clerk 's hearings , it is the attorney who speaks on behalf of the client and the client does not have to speak at all .
If you attend a clerk 's hearing without an attorney , that would obviously not be possible .
Oftentimes , accomplished and intelligent people contact our office after having tried to represent themselves at the clerk 's hearing -- and are bewildered that they ended up talking themselves into getting charged with the crime .
It is then up to our firm to try to undo the damage that the client has done to himself or herself .
You should not allow that to happen to yourself .
If you 're facing charges for shoplifting , or drug possession , or a crime such as assault and battery , or another misdemeanor crime , Attorney Yannetti and his colleagues can help you prepare for a clerk magistrate 's hearing .
They can also take steps designed to persuade the magistrate to reduce or dismiss the charges against you .
While there is no guarantee of success , you will put yourself in the best possible position to obtain a favorable result if you hire our firm -- or another qualified firm -- to represent you .

A bad attitude -- the new felony Share This :
that caught my eye this morning comes from Politico and concerns a D.C. mover - and - shaker named David Bass and a recent flight on Continental airlines .
Politico explains ,
An FBI agent and a couple of flight attendants say in court documents that Bass seemed drunk on the flight , disobeying instructions from the crew , climbing over another passenger to get to the overhead luggage bin , making â€œmean facesâ€  and generally â€œupsetting everyone in first class.â€ 
Bass says he was tired , â€œout of itâ€ on allergy medication and doesnâ€™t even know what a â€œmean faceâ€ is .
Frankly , I do n't believe Bass was as disruptive as the ' authorities ' allege -- and , yes , as absurd as it seems , flight attendants have now become ' agents of the state ' who can dish out prison sentences along with diet coke ; all it takes is for an attendant to complain about you .
My skepticism is not merely because I know how casually and automatically authorities lie , it is also based on a few aspects of the story .
For one thing , Bass " said he offered to take a blood - alcohol test when he got off the plane , but ... the officers declined . "
Nevertheless , I 'll assume Bass was every bit as obnoxious as the complaint alleges .
What is the sane response ?
Refuse to serve him alcohol , certainly .
And , then , to bar him from travelling on future Continental flights .
Nope .
Instead , the police met the plane upon landing .
Instead , he was charged under section of the PATRIOT act that prohibits â€œassaulting or intimidating a flight crew member or flight attendant of the aircraft , interferes with the performance of the duties of the member or attendant or lessens the ability of the member or attendant to perform those duties , or attempts or conspires to do such an act.â€ 
He is facing a possible 20 - year jail term essentially for making a " mean face " at an attendant who refused to continue serving him .
Sadly , I think the most unusual aspect of this story is the attention it has received due to Bass ' high political profile .
For every David Bass brutalized by airline authorities , I expect there are dozens of Joe Averages whose story is never heard .
Indeed , a recent story in the Los Angeles Times said there had been 200 - some convictions on that particular charge since it went on the books ... and that 's convictions , not just charges .
So ... now that a high profile case has shone a bright light on the absurdity and injustice of someone facing 20 - years in jail for pulling a " mean face " on an authority figure , the outrage will be pouring .
Right ?
Wrong .
Comments made in the popular Gawker blog are typical : Washington , DC PR man David Bass has a perfectly good explanation for why he was charged with a felony for disrupting a flight :
He was all hopped up on Benadryl !
He was awake for five days straight !
He wanted wine !
Or the blogger Lindsay Beyerstein who shrugged the incident off as Bass '
I must admit to a bit of shameful joy at the harassment of a D.C. insider ; it could n't happen to a ' nicer ' guy -- that is , short of it happening to an actual politician responsible for such laws .
But , overwhelmingly , my reaction is to feel a chill run through my blood .
The potential punishment for pulling a " mean face " on an attendant and being rude is now more than the punishments for attacking people and destroying property .
That 's the value the state puts on the demand for your ' respect . '
And the state can get away with it precisely because people snicker at the fool who does n't obey ( like the Gawker did ) or shrugs it off ( like other bloggers )
America has not only become a police state ; Americans are now accustomed to and so part of the " police culture . " .

During my morning browse - fest , I am stumbling more and more over news stories in which people are charged with felonies , repeatedly tased by police or otherwise brutalized for the crime of having a bad attitude .
No act of violence , no damage to property , no threat of violence is alleged ; the person is arrested pure and simply for a bad attitude .
In this context , the definition of bad is that the person spoke back to authority , said ' no ' to a request or did not comply quickly enough , asked a question or tried to argue ... in short , the person did not immediately and with subservience obey .
The story that caught my eye this morning comes from Politico and concerns a D.C. mover - and - shaker named David Bass and a recent flight on Continental airlines .
Politico explains , Frankly , I do n't believe Bass was as disruptive as the ' authorities ' allege -- and , yes , as absurd as it seems , flight attendants have now become ' agents of the state ' who can dish out prison sentences along with diet coke ; all it takes is for an attendant to complain about you .

She : Do you have a few moments to take a survey ?
Me : I guess so .
[ thinking : I know this whole script .
There was a time in my life when I was the one handing out tracts .
It should n't take long . ]
She : Great !
Do you live around here ?
Me : Yeah .
[ I 'm going to keep close .
I do n't feel like getting into a theological fight today . ]
She : Do you have a church that you attend ?
Me : Yeah .
She : Oh really ?
Which one ?
Me : Grace United Methodist .
She : Oh .
Well , I go to We 're More Christian Church [ or something like that ] , and I 'd like to invite you to join us if you 're ever interested in visiting .
[ She hands me the tract . ]
She : And one more question …
If you died today , are you certain of where you 'd spend eternity ?
[ I pause , thinking : I would n't word it exactly that way , but I really do n't want to get into an argument over semantics like I did the last time . ]
Me : Yes .
She , after seeing that I 'm not going to elaborate without further prompting :
And where is that ?
Me : Heaven .
She : And if God asked you , " Why should I let you into heaven ?
What have you done to deserve it ? "
How would you answer ?
Me : God 's not going to ask me that .
Ultimately it 's God 's decision , not mine .
[ Oh no , I am going to get into a theological argument after all . ]
She , opening one of the tracts :
Well , if you 'll say this prayer with me , you can be sure of getting into heaven .
Just repeat after me , " Heavenly Father … " [ pause ] " Heavenly Father … "
Me : Yeah , I 've said one of those before .
[ That 'll throw her off her script ! ]
She : But I thought you said you were n't sure ?
Did n't you just say it 's not your decision ?
But if you 've said this prayer , you can be sure .
So next time someone asks , say you 're certain .
Do n't let the devil tell you you 're not .
Me : Yeah , OK .
Bye .
[ Whew , that was close . ]
I knew , as soon as I saw her standing there with a handful of tracts , what her intentions were .
But when I did n't break eye contact soon enough , she started the conversation .
Here 's my problem with her type of theology :
It turns prayer into a magical incantation , and God into a genie who must do our bidding if we get the words right .
We earn our way into heaven by casting a spell that forces God to overlook our sinfulness .
That 's why I had to tell her it 's God 's decision , not ours .
I 'm not denying that we do make decisions to follow the will of God .
In fact , as a good Methodist I believe we must in some way respond to God 's call on our lives if we want to claim to be followers of Christ .
But ultimately , it 's up to God .
We do n't get into heaven by our own merits , and we can't recite a magical formula to force God to turn a blind eye to our shortcomings .
If we can't absolutely know the mind of God , we can't be absolutely certain that we 've got a free pass .
On the other hand , if we know God and have a strong relationship , we 've got something even better : trust .
We can trust God to make the right decision , because God is gracious and merciful , slow to anger and abounding in steadfast love .
What could a magical incantation give us that could possibly compare to that ?

Oprah Winfrey Will End Her Current Show on September 2011
Media mogul Oprah Winfrey is expected to announce today , November 20 , that she will end her current show on September 9 , 2011 after being on air for 25 years since 1986 .
The reason : to concentrate on the start of her own network .
The coming of this final show has been the topic of several rumors ever since Winfrey announced January last year that she partnered with Discovery to open a new cable network named OWN ( Oprah Winfrey Network ) .
It is expected to finally start broadcasting in 2011 to 75 million homes .
It is believed that , if not a revamped version , then a new talk show will be hosted by Oprah on OWN .
Winfrey ’s production company , Harpo , Inc. , confirmed the decision of the host to end the show after its current contract expires .
The company produced shows of Rachel Ray , Dr. Phil and Dr. Oz .
Several national and local networks stand to lose ratings and revenues once the program is pulled out .
CBS syndicates the show while ABC broadcasts it .

What most people know is that the Associated Press ( AP ) is one of the largest , internationally recognized , syndicated news services .
What most people do n’t know that is in 2004 , the AP was a “ birther ” news organization .
How so ?
Because in a syndicated report , published Sunday , June 27 , 2004 , by the Kenyan Standard Times , and which was , as of this report , available at
http://web.archive.org/web/20040627142700/eastandard.net/headlines/news26060403.htm
The AP reporter stated the following :
Kenyan - born US
Senate hopeful , Barrack Obama , appeared set to take over the Illinois Senate seat after his main rival , Jack Ryan , dropped out of the race on Friday night amid a furor over lurid sex club allegations .
This report explains the context of the oft cited debate , between Obama and Keyes in the following Fall , in which Keyes faulted Obama for not being a “ natural born citizen ” , and in which Obama , by his quick retort , “ So what ?
I am running for Illinois Senator , not the presidency ” , self - admitted that he was not eligible for the office .
Seeing that an AP reporter is too professional to submit a story which was not based on confirmed sources ( ostensibly the Obama campaign in this case ) , the inference seems inescapable : Obama himself was putting out in 2004 , that he was born in Kenya .
The difficulty in finding this gem of a story is hampered by Google , which is running flak for Obama : because if you search for “ Kenyan - born US Senate ” you wont find it , but if you search for the phrase without quotes you will find links which talk about it .
For those who believe what they see , here is the screen capture of the page from the Kenyan Sunday Standard , electronic edition , of June 27 , 2004 — Just in case that page is scrubbed from the Web Archive :
Readers should take note that this AP story , was syndicated world - wide , so you should be able to find it in major newspapers , archived in libraries world - wide .
If any reader does this , please let The Post & Email know , so that we can publish a follow up - story .
You can scrub the net , but scrubbing libraries world - wide is not so easy .

Hanen of Sentinel Blog Radio broke the public news of the existence of this AP story at on October 14 , 2009 at 12:31 pm .
However , The Post & Email can confirm that a professional investigator had uncovered this story months ago , and that certified and authenticated copies of this report , meeting Federal Rules of evidence , have already been prepared and archived at many locations nationwide .
It should be noted that on January 8 , 2006 , the Honolulu Advertiser also reported that Barack Hussein Obama was born outside the United States .
http://the.honoluluadvertiser.com/article/2006/Jan/08/ln/FP601080334.html
A Chronology of Deceit
One can now ask an important question which has not yet been emphasized enough : “ Just when did Obama begin to publically claim he was born in Hawaii ? ”
This question is distinct from the question , “ Just where in fact was Obama born ? ” , and from the other question , “ What do official documents say about where he was born ? ”
Regarding his claims , we can summarize what is known :
1. As of Monday , Aug. 28 , 2006 , Obama ’s Campaign was putting out that he was born in Hawaii .
This is known from the introductory speech given by Prof.
George A. O. Magoha , Vice - Chancellor of the University of Nairobi , on the occasion of a speech given there by Senator Obama that day .
( One presumes that the Vice - Chancellor was given notes from the Obama campaign , as is customary on such occasions )
2 . From the newspaper reports above , it is clear that the Obama campaign was putting out that he was born in Kenya , or overseas , during the period of June 27 , 2004 , until January 8 , 2006 .
3 . In October of 2004 , during the ABC Chicago Affiliate ’s broadcast of the Obama - Keyes debates , Obama openly admitted — he conceded — that he was not a natural born citizen .
( C - Span aired the uncut version of the debates , which contained this exchange , in the second half of April , 2005 )
4 . It is known from a classmate of Obama at Harvard University , that while at Harvard , Obama at least on one occasion admitted that he was born in Kenya .
( This friend went on record on a call in radio program in Idaho in early July , 2009 )
If any reader can find a link which documents a claim to a birth location before Aug.

The new green and white licence plates will be available next year .
( ( Ontario Ministry of Transportation ) )
Ontario is set to introduce green - coloured licence plates that will be available to those with plug - in hybrids and battery - powered electric vehicles .
The new plates will be available next year , the Ministry of Transportation said in a release .
Electric vehicles with the plates will be able to travel in the province 's carpool lanes until 2015 — even if only one person is in the vehicle .
Owners of eligible vehicles can also use recharging stations at GO Transit and other provincially owned parking lots .
Owners of those vehicles will also have access to special parking spots at University of Toronto , some Wal - Mart locations , and at other private companies .
" The McGuinty government 's plan is to have one out of every 20 passenger vehicles on Ontario 's roads an electric vehicle by 2020 , " said Transportation Minister Jim Bradley in a statement .
Ontarians picked the design from a field of four choices in an online poll .
SAN FRANCISCO  Kara Lynn has amyotrophic lateral sclerosis , or A.L.S. , which has attacked the muscles around her mouth and throat , removing her ability to speak .
A couple of years ago , she spent more than $ 8,000 to buy a computer , approved by Medicare , that turns typed words into speech that her family , friends and doctors can hear .
Under government insurance requirements , the maker of the PC , which ran ordinary Microsoft Windows software , had to block any nonspeech functions , like sending e-mail or browsing the Web .
Dismayed by the PC ’s limitations and clunky design , Ms. Lynn turned to a $ 300 iPhone 3G from Apple running $ 150 text - to - speech software .
Ms. Lynn , who is 48 and lives in Poughkeepsie , N.Y. , said it worked better and let her “ wear her voice ” around her neck while snuggling with her 5 - year - old son , Aiden , who has Down syndrome .
Medicare and private health insurers decline to cover cheap devices like iPhones and netbook PCs that can help the speech - impaired , despite their usefulness and lower cost .

There may be no single organization which runs more Linux systems than Google .
But the kernel development community knows little about how Google uses Linux and what sort of problems are encountered there .
Google 's Mike Waychison traveled to Tokyo to help shed some light on this situation ; the result was an interesting view on what it takes to run Linux in this extremely demanding setting .
Mike started the talk by giving the developers a good laugh : it seems that Google manages its kernel code with Perforce .
He apologized for that .
There is a single tree that all developers commit to .
About every 17 months , Google rebases its work to a current mainline release ; what follows is a long struggle to make everything work again .
Once that 's done , internal " feature " releases happen about every six months .
This way of doing things is far from ideal ; it means that Google lags far behind the mainline and has a hard time talking with the kernel development community about its problems .
There are about 30 engineers working on Google 's kernel .
Currently they tend to check their changes into the tree , then forget about them for the next 18 months .
This leads to some real maintenance issues ; developers often have little idea of what 's actually in Google 's tree until it breaks .
And there 's a lot in that tree .
Google started with the 2.4.18 kernel - but they patched over 2000 files , inserting 492,000 lines of code .
Among other things , they backported 64 - bit support into that kernel .
Eventually they moved to 2.6.11 , primarily because they needed SATA support .
A 2.6.18 - based kernel followed , and they are now working on preparing a 2.6.26 - based kernel for deployment in the near future .
They are currently carrying 1208 patches to 2.6.26 , inserting almost 300,000 lines of code .
Roughly 25 % of those patches , Mike estimates , are backports of newer features .
There are plans to change all of this ;
Google 's kernel group is trying to get to a point where they can work better with the kernel community .
They 're moving to git for source code management , and developers will maintain their changes in their own trees .
Those trees will be rebased to mainline kernel releases every quarter ; that should , it is hoped , motivate developers to make their code more maintainable and more closely aligned with the upstream kernel .
Linus asked : why are n't these patches upstream ?
Is it because Google is embarrassed by them , or is it secret stuff that they do n't want to disclose , or is it a matter of internal process problems ?
The answer was simply " yes . "
Some of this code is ugly stuff which has been carried forward from the 2.4.18 kernel .
There are also doubts internally about how much of this stuff will be actually useful to the rest of the world .
But , perhaps , maybe about half of this code could be upstreamed eventually .
As much as 3/ 4 of Google 's code consists of changes to the core kernel ; device support is a relatively small part of the total .
Google has a number of " pain points " which make working with the community harder .
Keeping up with the upstream kernel is hard - it simply moves too fast .
There is also a real problem with developers posting a patch , then being asked to rework it in a way which turns it into a much larger project .
Alan Cox had a simple response to that one : people will always ask for more , but sometimes the right thing to do is to simply tell them " no . "
In the area of CPU scheduling , Google found the move to the completely fair scheduler to be painful .
In fact , it was such a problem that they finally forward - ported the old O ( 1 ) scheduler and can run it in 2.6.26 .
Changes in the semantics of sched_yield ( ) created grief , especially with the user - space locking that Google uses .
High - priority threads can make a mess of load balancing , even if they run for very short periods of time .
And load balancing matters : Google runs something like 5000 threads on systems with 16 - 32 cores .
On the memory management side , newer kernels changed the management of dirty bits , leading to overly aggressive writeout .
The system could easily get into a situation where lots of small I/O operations generated by kswapd would fill the request queues , starving other writeback ; this particular problem should be fixed by the per-BDI writeback changes in 2.6.32 .
As noted above , Google runs systems with lots of threads - not an uncommon mode of operation in general .
One thing they found is that sending signals to a large thread group can lead to a lot of run queue lock contention .
They also have trouble with contention for the mmap_sem semaphore ; one sleeping reader can block a writer which , in turn , blocks other readers , bringing the whole thing to a halt .
The kernel needs to be fixed to not wait for I/O with that semaphore held .
Google makes a lot of use of the out - of - memory ( OOM ) killer to pare back overloaded systems .
That can create trouble , though , when processes holding mutexes encounter the OOM killer .
Mike wonders why the kernel tries so hard , rather than just failing allocation requests when memory gets too tight .
So what is Google doing with all that code in the kernel ?
They try very hard to get the most out of every machine they have , so they cram a lot of work onto each .
This work is segmented into three classes : " latency sensitive , " which gets short - term resource guarantees , " production batch " which has guarantees over longer periods , and " best effort " which gets no guarantees at all .
This separation of classes is done partly through the separation of each machine into a large number of fake " NUMA nodes . "
Specific jobs are then assigned to one or more of those nodes .
One thing added by Google is " NUMA - aware VFS LRUs " - virtual memory management which focuses on specific NUMA nodes .
Nick Piggin remarked that he has been working on something like that and would have liked to have seen Google 's code .
There is a special SCHED_GIDLE scheduling class which is a truly idle class ; if there is no spare CPU available , jobs in that class will not run at all .
To avoid priority inversion problems , SCHED_GIDLE processes have their priority temporarily increased whenever they sleep in the kernel ( but not if they are preempted in user space ) .
Networking is managed with the HTB queueing discipline , augmented with a bunch of bandwidth control logic .
For disks , they are working on proportional I /O scheduling .
Beyond that , a lot of Google 's code is there for monitoring .
They monitor all disk and network traffic , record it , and use it for analyzing their operations later on .
Hooks have been added to let them associate all disk I/O back to applications - including asynchronous writeback I/O .
Mike was asked if they could use tracepoints for this task ; the answer was " yes , " but , naturally enough , Google is using its own scheme now .
Google has a lot of important goals for 2010 ; they include :
They are excited about CPU limits ; these are intended to give priority access to latency - sensitive tasks while still keeping those tasks from taking over the system entirely .
RPC - aware CPU scheduling ; this involves inspection of incoming RPC traffic to determine which process will wake up in response and how important that wakeup is .
A related initiative is delayed scheduling .
For most threads , latency is not all that important .
But the kernel tries to run them immediately when RPC messages come in ; these messages tend not to be evenly distributed across CPUs , leading to serious load balancing problems .
So threads can be tagged for delayed scheduling ; when a wakeup arrives , they are not immediately put onto the run queue .
Instead , the wait until the next global load balancing operation before becoming truly runnable .
Idle cycle injection : high - bandwidth power management so they can run their machines right on the edge of melting down - but not beyond .
Better memory controllers are on the list , including accounting for kernel memory use .
" Offline memory . "
Mike noted that it is increasingly hard to buy memory which actually works , especially if you want to go cheap .
So they need to be able to set bad pages aside .
The HWPOISON work may help them in this area .
They need dynamic huge pages , which can be assembled and broken down on demand .
On the networking side , there is a desire to improve support for receive - side scaling - directing incoming traffic to specific queues .
They need to be able to account for software interrupt time and attribute it to specific tasks - networking processing can often involve large amounts of softirq processing .
They 've been working on better congestion control ; the algorithms they have come up with are " not Internet safe " but work well in the data center .
And " TCP pacing " slows down outgoing traffic to avoid overloading switches .
For storage , there is a lot of interest in reducing block - layer overhead so it can keep up with high - speed flash .
Using flash for disk acceleration in the block layer is on the list .
They 're looking at in - kernel flash translation layers , though it was suggested that it might be better to handle that logic directly in the filesystem .
Mike concluded with a couple of " interesting problems . "
One of those is that Google would like a way to pin filesystem metadata in memory .
The problem here is being able to bound the time required to service I /O requests .
The time required to read a block from disk is known , but if the relevant metadata is not in memory , more than one disk I /O operation may be required .
That slows things down in undesirable ways .
Google is currently getting around this by reading file data directly from raw disk devices in user space , but they would like to stop doing that .
The other problem was lowering the system call overhead for providing caching advice ( with fadvise ( ) ) to the kernel .
It 's not clear exactly what the problem was here .
All told , it was seen as one of the more successful sessions , with the kernel community learning a lot about one of its biggest customers .
If Google 's plans to become more community - oriented come to fruition , the result should be a better kernel for all .
Next : Performance regressions
The mass deaths are difficult to quantify because wild bats are almost impossible to count , but to scientists monitoring hibernation sites , serious declines are as undeniable as they are unprecedented .
Population counts at two dozen small winter colonies in Massachusetts , New York , and Vermont show they have plummeted from 48,626 bats to 2,695 -- an average 94.5 percent decline -- since the outbreak began .
The little brown bat , historically among the most common of North American bats , has been the hardest hit of the six species known to be afflicted with the baffling illness .
The others are : the big brown bat , the Eastern small - footed bat , the Northern long - eared bat , the tri-colored bat ( formerly known as the Eastern pipistrelle ) , and the Indiana bat .
“ We ’re at the vanguard of an environmental catastrophe , ” says Tim King , a conservation geneticist with the US Geological Survey in West Virginia .
“ There ’s very little definitive information available at this point .
Everybody ’s just scrambling , with very limited resources , to do whatever they can to help -- help stop this . ”
At least 1 million bats in the past three years have been wiped out by a puzzling , widespread disease dubbed “ white - nose syndrome ” in what preeminent US scientists are calling the most precipitous decline of North American wildlife in human history .
If it is n’t slowed or stopped , they believe bats will continue disappearing from the landscape in huge numbers and that entire species could become extinct within a decade .
It ’s enough to make some wonder :
Is the bat in the cave the new canary in the coal mine ?
It ’s late August , when bats are in their swarming phase , and the 71 - year - old Kunz and two fellow biologists have trekked , at night , in hard rain , with heavy gear , 2,520 feet up the rugged Taconic Mountains to Aeolus -- the largest bat hibernaculum in the Northeast -- to bleed live bats and collect samples for researchers leading the hunt for clues into the cause of mysterious bat deaths like these .
“ What we saw was bat soup .
There were a lot of bones of wings and skulls and emulsified bodies , ” Kunz says .
“ There were dead bats -- decomposing bats -- hanging from the walls of the cave .
The renowned bat biologist from Boston University , who bears a passing resemblance to Harrison Ford , minutes earlier had recovered the bands while trudging , like a real - life Indiana Jones , through a slippery mud -like ooze of rotting bat carcasses , liquefied internal organs , toothpick - sized bones , piles of guano , and a strange white fungus on the cave floor .
Thomas Kunz emerges from Aeolus cave in East Dorset , Vermont , with a half - dozen metal ID bands -- smaller than SpaghettiOs -- cupped in the palm of his latex - gloved hand .
They ’re tiny emblems of death , having once been affixed to the forearms of little brown bats .
Initial white - nose studies have produced two consistent findings :
The fungus has been found on bats at every site where mass deaths have occurred , and most of the dead bats are emaciated .
But the link between them has evaded scientists .
The leading hypothesis -- Kunz shorthands it as “ itch and scratch ” -- is that the fungus irritates the bats ’ skin , arousing them more frequently than normal in hibernation to groom it off .
Those actions , the thinking goes , squander their fat reserves until , ultimately , they starve to death .
The hallmark of the syndrome is a skin infection that creates holes in and scarring of the bats ’ wing membranes , causing them to lose elasticity .
“ It ’s challenging to think of why an animal might die of a skin infection .
Is n’t that just like getting athlete ’s foot ? ” says David Blehert , director of diagnostic microbiology at the National Wildlife Health Center in Wisconsin and lead author of the report that identified the fungus .
But you ca n’t really liken it to that , he explains , because this infection “ actively invades living skin cells . ”
Researchers strongly suspect but have not proved that the sickness is caused by a newly identified cold - thriving soil fungus aptly named Geomyces destructans .
( Some believe the fungus is a secondary infection that grows on bats with already weakened immune systems . )
Nor have they unraveled the enigma of a perplexing chain of events that leads from an apparent fungal infection to erratic bat behavior to death by what appears to be starvation .
White - nose syndrome gets its name from the white fungus that looks like confectioners ’ sugar found around the noses -- as well as on the ears , wings , and other exposed skin -- of many infected bats , though not all show signs of the disease .
In addition to Massachusetts , New York , and Vermont , the plague - like condition has been confirmed in Connecticut , New Hampshire , New Jersey , Pennsylvania , and , earlier this year , Virginia and West Virginia .
It appears headed toward caves and mines in Kentucky and Tennessee , and possibly North Carolina and Ohio .
( There have been no confirmed cases in Ontario or Quebec . )
For Kunz and his colleagues , this winter will be telling .
Since white - nose was detected in February 2006 by a caver photographing a private section of Howe Caverns near Albany , New York -- considered the disease epicenter -- its spread , from New England to South Atlantic states , has been terrifyingly swift .
Infected hibernation sites were discovered the second winter less than 20 miles from Howe ; the next , about 120 miles ; and by last winter , more than 650 miles .
Scientists are alarmed that white - nose syndrome , unlike many wildlife diseases , is a multi-species killer , infecting nearly every cave - dwelling bat species in states where it has struck .
It attacks the bats as they hibernate in caves and mines , typically from mid-October to mid-April .
“ If it continues at this pace , ” says New York bat specialist Alan Hicks , “ in a few years we wo n’t have any [ of these ] bats . ”
The animals , which are nocturnal , are exhibiting other aberrant behaviors , such as clustering near cave entrances where it ’s coldest , perhaps an attempt to lower body temperatures further to conserve energy , and flying around outside in winter , in daylight , possibly in a desperate search for food .
Because Geomyces destructans grows in chilly cave - like temperatures , optimally 41 to 57 degrees Fahrenheit , bat biologists originally thought the die - offs might end when surviving bats fled the hibernacula .
But they kept on dying into May and June .
“ Even those bats that might make it through the winter may have sufficient wing damage that they ’ve lost maneuverability and they can’t catch food very effectively , ” says DeeAnn Reeder , a bat researcher at Bucknell University .
“ So , there ’s all of these things that are happening to them , and we have n’t connected those dots . ”
Heightening concerns further , female bats give birth just once a year to a single pup or twins .
“ They are not going to be able to rebound from this very quickly , if at all , ” says Vermont Fish and Wildlife biologist Scott Darling .
Scientists are not certain how white - nose syndrome is spread but say its rapid dispersal suggests bats -- which can migrate 200 miles between summer roosts , where they intermingle , and hibernation sites -- are most likely transmitting the disease to one another .
Increasingly , however , there are suspicions that humans who explore caves and mines may play a role in the spread by unwittingly carrying fungal spores , which attach to their clothing and equipment , from infected sites to clean ones .
As a precaution , the US Forest Service last spring closed approximately 2,000 caves and mines in 33 states in its Eastern and Southern regions for up to one year .
The action followed a US Fish and Wildlife Service request that the public observe a caving moratorium in 17 states .
Since then , cave owners and managers have closed dozens more .
Of the six species of bats affected so far , only one -- the Indiana bat -- is on the federal endangered list .
If white - nose syndrome continues its anticipated blitzkrieg deeper South and into the Midwest , three more species on that list are likely to be imperiled : the gray bat , the Virginia big - eared bat , and the Ozark big - eared bat .
Yet even fears that some species could vanish entirely are being overshadowed by the enormity of ordinary bats , like little browns , dying by the tens of thousands .
No one can predict the ecological fallout from
1 million dead bats -- some say the actual figure might be double that -- but whenever something is taken out of the ecosystem in large numbers , there are obvious concerns .
What You Need to Qualify for a Mortgage
There is a lot of talk going on right now about the first time home buyer tax credit , what will happen when it expires , and whether Congress will approve an extension of the home buyer tax credit program .
But no matter what happens with the tax credit for home purchase — and whether or not you end up taking advantage of it — you need to understand what is required if you want to qualify for a home mortgage loan .
Here are the basics of what many mortgage lenders are looking for right now :
Credit Score :
In the heyday of mortgage lending , you could qualify for a home loan with just about any credit score .
As you might imagine , mortgage lenders are not so rash anymore .
In order to even be considered , you will likely need a credit score of 660-680 .
If you want the best interest rate , though , you will need somewhere around a 720 - 740 .
Those low mortgage interest rates are nice , but not everyone will qualify for them .
Debt - to - Income Ratio :
The amount of debt you have in relation to your income is a major consideration for mortgage lenders .
They want to make sure that your debt wo n’t overcome your ability to pay .
For most lenders , the debt - to - income ratio tops out at around 40 % of your monthly income being used for debt payments .
However , if you want the best mortgage rate , you will need to adhere to the 28/36 qualifying ratio .
This states that your housing costs cannot exceed 28 % of your monthly income , and your total debt payments each month should not exceed 36 % .
Down Payment :
The days of 0 % down payment mortgages are pretty much over ( at least until the next housing bubble ) , so you will need to put some money down .
Many lenders want a 10 % to 15 % down payment , although some will accept 5 % down .
For the best rates , some lenders are now requiring 20 % to 30 % down payments .
As a result of these new down payment requirements , many people are turning to FHA loans , which only require a 3.5 % down payment .
Income Documentation : Gone are the days of low - doc and no -doc loans .
Now , you need documentation of your income — and plenty of it .
Some mortgage lenders require six months of pay stubs and two months ’ worth of bank statements on top of your last two years ’ tax returns .
Making sure that you can handle the payments is paramount to mortgage lenders right now .
If you are self - employed , this process can be even more onerous :
When I applied for my home mortgage loan , I had to go through an income audit with an accountant ( price : $ 600 ) in order to acceptably document my income .
In addition to these basic requirements , some banks may require a certain degree of liquidity .
They may require that you have at three months ’ worth of payments available in a savings account , emergency fund or some other place where it is readily available .
Some banks want as much as 12 months or more available for payments .
They want to know that if you lose your job or run into some other problem , they will still be paid — for at least a little while .
First Time Home Buyer Tax Credit for Home Mortgage Loans
These rules still apply even if you are trying to get a first time home buyer tax credit , although you can use the $ 8,000 tax credit toward your down payment .
If you want to take advantage of the first time home buyer tax credit , though , you might be running out of time .
If Congress does n’t extend the deadline ( currently November 30 , 2009 ) , then you need to hurry .
Home loans need to close by November 30 in order to qualify .
With most mortgages taking around 45 days to close , it means that if you do n’t get the paperwork started by October 16 , you could be in trouble .
If you run into issues , it can take up to 60 days to close on a mortgage — and you could miss the deadline .
Responsibly getting a home mortgage has always required good financial management , planning and preparation .
Now , though , with tightened lending standards , it is even more important that you prepare ahead of time to buy a home .
Pat Gaines actually felt sorry for the red- tailed hawks at Bonny Lake State Park this summer .
Despite their aggressive reputation , loud screams and fierce , piercing looks , the red - tailed hawks at the park north of Burlington , just west of the Colorado - Kansas border , were being bullied when Gaines saw them .
“ I ’ve never seen red - tails harassed so much .
They all seemed hoarse .
I felt kind of sorry for them , ” said Gaines of the sight of dozens of little birds dive - bombing the hawks .
The hawks were minding their own business , Gaines recalled .
But the western kingbirds at the park were upset .
Highly territorial , the kingbirds felt the hawks were intruding on their space , said Gaines , a Westminster scientist who helps develop vaccines and tests used in veterinary medicine .
Gaines had focused his camera on one red - tailed hawk because the bird had been screaming .
As he followed the hawk across the sky , a kingbird dive - bombed the hawk .
The hawk , which is not a predator of the kingbird , flew as fast as it could from the kingbird .
For a moment it appeared the kingbird had stopped attacking .
But then it began the pursuit again and — to Gaines amazement — landed on the hapless red - tail ’s back .
“ He rode the hawk for 25 yards .
The hawk was not trying to fight back — it was just trying to get out of there , ” said Gaines .
As the kingbird rode bareback on the hawk , it pecked away at the hawk ’s head .
“ They ( the kingbirds ) are not afraid of anything , ” said Gaines .
“ Until this happened , I had never seen one perch on a hawk ’s back . ”
Gaines posted his photo at the Colorado Birder website last month , where he is a frequent contributor .
Other sites , including some in the United Kingdom , have picked up the photo .
The comment posted by Colorado Birder Sarah E sums up the reaction to the image : “ Awesome photo ! ”

In glossy magazine shoots , retouching is de rigueur .
“ I have never yet seen , and you probably never will see , a fashion or beauty picture that has n’t been retouched , ” Mr. Hudson said .
In Britain , tabloid outrage over the use of unhealthily thin models in fashion shows and magazine spreads has been fueled by photos that have been altered to streamline models or celebrities .
One often - cited example is a 2003 cover of GQ magazine in Britain on which the actress Kate Winslet appeared several sizes smaller than her actual self .
But some magazine editors say they are now overcompensating in the other direction .
“ I spent the first 10 years of my career making girls look thinner , ” Robin Derrick , creative director of British Vogue , told The Times of London recently .
“ I ’ve spent the last 10 making them look larger . ”
On retouching , even Ms. Swinson acknowledged that “ a little bit is necessary to make a good photo . ”
Under her proposal , all advertising photos would be rated , perhaps on a scale from 1 to 4 , depending on the degree of retouching .
A “ 1 ” might involve only altered lighting , for example , while a “ 4 ” might warn of cosmetic changes via Photoshop , she said .
And the label would have to include an explanation of the changes .
“ If people knew they had to describe what they had altered , it might make them less likely to do it , ” Ms. Swinson said .
Unlike Ms. Boyer , Ms. Swinson said she thought such a system could be put in place without legislation .
She said she hoped to work through the Advertising Standards Authority , which monitors the content of ads in Britain , to encourage advertisers to adopt it .
The Liberal Democrats have been trying to put pressure on the standards authority , which is financed by advertisers , with a Web site urging consumers to complain about examples of strikingly altered ads .
The site has highlighted a campaign this summer for Olay cosmetics , in which the model Twiggy appears to have been given a younger woman ’s skin , and an ad for Chanel Coco Mademoiselle perfume in which the actress Keira Knightley sports an apparently enlarged bosom .
Ms. Knightley has joked about the featuring of such enhancements in ads for the movie “ King Arthur , ” in which she starred .
Matt Wilson , a spokesman for the standards authority , said that out of 26,000 complaints from the British public last year , five involved airbrushing .
He said the agency already had sufficient tools to deal with misleading ads of all kinds , not just those that involve retouching .
The idea for this post has two sources .
The first was a post on SEOmoz about someone 's failed attempt to get quotes for SEO .
In light of that firestorm , I was asked if I would write a blog post about how potential clients should approach SEO companies they are looking to do business with .
A few days later , while reading David Ogilvy 's classic Ogilvy on Advertising , I came across the chapter which is an " open letter to a client in search of an agency . "
This post is modeled after ( stolen from ? ) that .
Sir or Madam ,
If you have decided to hire a new SEO firm or consultant , permit me to suggest a simple way to go about it .
Do n't delegate the selection to a secretary , webmaster , your IT department or a low - level employee .
They usually get it wrong .
Do it yourself .
Start by looking at search results .
No , not searches for " SEO " or " Search Engine Optimization company . "
Those do n't produce quality leads so most SEO agencies do n't bother trying to rank for them .
Instead , look at sites that rank in the search results and then find out who does their search engine optimization and online marketing .
Read articles on SEO and make note of the authors that you find most knowledgeable and helpful .
Talk to them , find out if they do SEO or who they recommend .
Get recommendations .
By this time you have a short list .
Research each company yourself .
Read through their websites not just the testimonials page .
Look to see if their knowledge and experience in SEO is clear .
Call and talk to the head of each agency and their head SEO ( it may be the same person , that 's OK . )
Make sure the chemistry and communication between you and them is good .
You 'll be working together for a long time so make sure you 're a good fit .
Do n't worry about meeting the whole team .
Each agency is different and you may or may not be working directly with anyone else .
Not all SEOs are good with customer interaction and you have no real way of judging the talent of an individual .
Good SEO is the result of the everyone working together , not just that of an individual .
Ask each agency to provide you with client references .
Not printed materials , but phone numbers of current clients that you can call and talk to .
Find out if the SEO has improved the overall success of their business , not just improved search engine rankings .
Pick the consultant or firm that you feel has the best record of success and is most likely to help you grow your business .
Ask for a quote .
If you get a stock cost of services then you 've got the wrong company .
If you get a price range , pursue it further .
If you get a customized quote but it falls out of your budget range , consider it anyway .
Find out what services the company will be engaged in while marketing your website and the cost / benefit of each .
Do n't haggle over price only over the specific services provided ( cost will change as services change . )
Its entirely possible that the SEO company can reduce their fees by trimming services such as social media marketing , link building , content development , etc .
You can always add those back in later if they are determined to be necessary for the success of your campaign .
If you haggle over cost then you 'll likely come up on the short end in the long run .
You can also ask for the same amount of work be performed over a longer period of time .
This will create a slower path to improved performance , but will fit your budget better without cutting essential services .
Insist on a twelve - month contract .
SEO takes time to implement and to see the results .
The larger the site , and the more keywords there are to target , the more work needs to be done .
SEOs can cram everything into a few months , but the up front cost will be extremely high .
Longer contracts give both you and the SEO more security and reduce the pressure of having unwarranted expectations that can not be met .
Now that you have your SEO firm or consultant , are you going to get the best out of them ?
Clients get the SEO they deserve .
Some clients tie their SEO 's hands by disagreeing with most change recommendations .
Others use up all their account time keeping the SEO on the phone " discussing " the account .
Some clients slow the process by not responding to the SEOs queries and requests .
Others are an absolute dream to work for , responding promptly , providing feedback as needed and letting the SEO do their thing .
There is nothing wrong calling your SEO provider if it helps the SEO campaign progress , but too many " updates " slow the process to a crawl .
Anybody can perform their own SEO based on an article they once read somewhere .
It takes a genius to leave the SEO alone to do their work and implement the changes they request .
I had one client rewrite all the copy we fixed .
He believed his audience was too sophisticated for calls to action .
He 's wrong .
Give your SEO access to your website analytics data as well as all sales and conversion data .
This will help them assess performance ( real performance , not rankings ) of their optimization efforts .
It will also help them steer the optimization efforts into the most profitable direction .
Give your SEO a single point of contact , and make sure it is someone who has the power to make decisions .
Too often SEO recommendations are shot down by someone who is not involved in the process and has very little understanding of why the recommendation was made .
These people can include VPs , web developers and IT staff .
I have found that web developers are often the least knowledgeable about SEO but can be the biggest hindrance to it 's success .
They do n't want anybody telling them that their product needs to be fixed .
It 's too bad , because it does .
If you do have to reject recommendations , be sure to investigate it first .
Too many recommendations are shot down because someone does n't feel it 's necessary , when in fact it is critical to the optimization process .
Yes , some recommendations are lower priority than others and some will cost money to implement .
Reject a recommendation only after you have discussed the reasoning , urgency and impact with the SEO .
Then you can reject it with full knowledge of the potential result .
Never reject a recommendation because a developer says it can't be done .
It can be done , but perhaps just not by them .
I have one client that has gone through three different development companies since we started working for them .
None of their developers have liked me .
People do n't often like those that point out their flaws .
I also have clients where the developers are quick to work with me on any and all recommendations .
We do n't always do it my way , or their way but together we develop solutions that work for everyone .
Those are often our most successful clients .
There is a convention that SEO firms should never have more than one client in a particular industry .
When we work for a site selling kids winter clothes , we are not supposed to work for a site that also sells kids clothes for all seasons .
It sounds simple but its impracticable .
Suppose our client sells kids winter clothes and another that sells winter clothes and snowboards for adults only .
Then one year the snowboard shop starts selling clothes and gear for kids while the clothes shop starts selling kids snowboards .
Do we have to fire one of these clients , and if so which one ?
The one that was with us longer or the one that pays more ?
I see no conflict when optimizing two or even three sites in the exact same industry .
Often what is learned on one site can benefit the other , and vice versa .
After all , there are ten top 10 positions .
But even still , it 's likely that the keywords being targeted will vary .
And where there is some overlap , one site may rank slightly higher with one keyword and the other will rank slightly higher on another .
You are competing for business , not rankings , and the visitor will click the other top ranked spots regardless of who optimized them .
I 'd think twice about demanding exclusion .
If the SEO improves your business , then that is all you need to care about .
On the other hand , if the SEO gets a better paying client in your industry , you may be the one that gets fired .

Kamouraska with Esprit Orchestra
By Charles Wilson
Opera in Concert
Story continues below advertisement
Jane Mallett Theatre
In Toronto on Saturday
Anne Hébert 's dramatic novel Kamouraska tells a dark tale of brutality and revenge , murder and guilt , human frailty and its pitiable consequences .
It is a natural for transformation into an opera of the old kind .
It cries out for a Verdi .
Later , a Strauss might have served , or , closer to our own day , a Berg , a Shostakovich , a Britten .
In Canada , Somers or Schafer could have done something striking with it , but I doubt it would have tempted either of them .
Thirty - five years ago this harrowing melodrama did tempt Canadian composer Charles Wilson .
By the mid 1970s Wilson had enjoyed some success with three of his operas , all completed in 1972 : the church opera The Summoning of Everyman , the children 's The Selfish Giant , and the grand Heloise and Abelard , the last a commission by the Canadian Opera Company to mark its 25th anniversary .
So , in 1975 he approached Kamouraska with a measure of experience ; but not , perhaps enough .
Wilson 's Kamouraska was not accepted for performance at the time .
And when his next opera Psycho Red ( commissioned by the Guelph Spring Festival for production in 1978 ) was not a critical success , he seemed to close down his operatic endeavours .
Kamouraska lay smouldering in a drawer , unproduced till now .
Its belated brave premiere , in a chamber revision for two performances ( Saturday and Sunday ) by Toronto 's valiant Opera in Concert , left us longing for more and less .
More clearly profiled arias and ensembles , abetted instead of interfered - with by the orchestra of 14 players .
More simple intelligibility .
More areas of relief to spell off the dramatic highs .
Less strife and clutter in the orchestral fabric .
Too often it was too noisy to hear .
Apart from a general unintelligibility ( we should accept the cynical truth that English surtitles are now a necessity in English - language opera ) some of the singing was remarkably good .

The exquisite Miriam Khalil as the young Elizabeth D'Aulnieres and the stately Loralie Kirkpatrick as the mature Elizabeth were excellent .
Baritone Alexander Dobson was a mellifluous Dr. Nelson and a handsome one , somewhat impeded by his Salvador Dali hairdo .
Mezzo - soprano Erica Iris Huang gave the best singing of the evening as the sympathetic Aunt Adelaide .
And Gillian Grossman and Mia Harris were well - cast as the other two aunts .
Tenor James McLennan was an effectively despicable Antoine Tassy , Elizabeth 's abusive first husband .
Jenny Cohen was a bold Aurelie Caron , Elizabeth 's maid and confidante .
Baritone Gregory Finney was a plausible Jerome Rolland , Elizabeth 's dying second husband .
Conductor Alex Pauk did his florid best with Wilson 's overwrought score , and Guillermo Silva - Marin managed adroitly the moving and grouping of his cast to convey the changing times and places of the story .
But if the opera is to have a future in needs a subtler , cannier scoring and a greater practical concern for the detailed conveyance of its text .

Forgive me for rolling my eyes , but I 've been down this road a few million times , and I still do n't know where it leads .
Only the tone - deaf doubt the power of music , though some feel it more strongly than others .
Kingsley Amis actually went so far as to claim that " only a world without love strikes me as instantly and decisively more terrible than one without music . "
Catch me on the right day and I might well go along with Amis — but why ?
What is it about music that is capable of swaying human emotions ?
To answer that question , you have to start by asking another one :
What does music mean ?
We know what a pop song or an opera aria means because the words tell us — but how do we know what a symphony means ?
Instrumental music is nonverbal and thus radically ambiguous .
It does n't lend itself to what might be called content - oriented analysis , though plenty of intellectuals have tried to analyze it in precisely that way .
The philosopher Susanne Langer , for instance , defined music as " a tonal analogue of emotive life . "
Yeah , well , OK , but what does that mean ?
As Steven Anderson told his congregation on August 16 , 2009 , " you have probably never heard a sermon like this before .
Actually , you probably have if you have been coming to church here for a while .
But you know what ?
Here is my sermon , why I hate Barack Obama .
That 's my sermon tonight , because Barack Obama is coming to town tomorrow morning . "
Pastor Anderson has gained national and international media attention for that sermon , in which he declared he is praying " imprecatory prayer " for Obama 's death .
Media attention has missed the fact that Anderson preached an almost identical but even more virulently hateful version of the same sermon two days before Barack Obama was inaugurated , during which Anderson appeared to veer over the line into direct incitement , declaring " somebody should abort Barack Obama . "
But , Anderson is only one of three nationally recognized Christian pastors who have declared they are praying for the death of the current president of the United States .
Pastor Wiley Drake is a Former Vice President of the Southern Baptist Convention who also served as Alan Keyes ’ American Independent Party running mate in the 2008 election .
Wiley Drake has long been linked with the violent wing of the antiabortion movement and prior to the murder of abortion doctor George Tiller , Drake announced he was praying for Tiller ’s death .
After Tiller ’s murder , during a June 2 , 2009 appearance on Alan Colmes ’ nationally syndicated radio show , Wiley Drake declared that his prayers had been answered and then went on to inform Colmes that he was praying for president Barack Obama ’s death ( also see here ) .
A third , and perhaps even more menacing anti-Obama " death prayer pastor " is Peter Peters of the LaPorte , Colorado Church of Christ .
During the 1980 ’s , members of the white supremacist militia group The Order attended Peters ’ church and four months after Pastor Pete Peters and his parishioner Colonel Jack Mohr appeared on Jewish talk show host Alan Berg 's Denver radio show , during which the radio show host confronted Peters and Mohr about their views , Berg was machine - gunned to death .
Members of The Order were later convicted of the murder .
Peters went on to host an October 1992 planning meeting , with white supremacist and NeoNazi leaders , during which an organizing strategy for a national paramilitary network was hammered out .
Former Aryan Nations member Floyd Cochran said of Peters , " He does n’t espouse Hitler .
He does n’t use the swastika or Klan robes .
Instead he uses the Bible and the American flag .
Peters talks in a language we ’re used to hearing .
His hatred is masked in God . "
Along with Steven Anderson , Peter Peters also gave an anti-Obama imprecatory prayer church service prior to Barack Obama ’s inauguration .
In Peters ' January 19 , 2009 sermon , broadcast over the Internet , Pete Peters concluded with a " party crashing " imprecatory prayer to call down divine destruction on Barack Obama ’s inaugural celebration :
" On those false oath swearers and false oath takers bring destruction ...
Melt and try with your fiery wrath those who with deceit speak lies and refuse to know you .
Bring your vengeance upon them and upon them who have given oaths to Satan and false gods in their practice of divination . "
-------------------
Why should mainstream American society take such incitement seriously ?
As part of the answer to that question , one of the key claims of pastors Anderson , Drake , and Peters is that Barack Obama ’s presidency is not legitmate .
According to Drake , Obama is a " usurper . "
All three pastors cite variants of " birther " conspiracy theories which assert Barack Obama was not born in the United States and , therefore , is n’t a US citizen .
The percentage of Americans who believe that class of conspiracy theory , according to a poll conducted in July 2009 for the Daily Kos website by Research 2000 , is truly astounding .
The poll revealed that only 42 % of Republicans were sure Barack Obama was born in the United States .
30 % were n’t sure , while 28 % believed Obama was not born in the US .
Adding up all the categories [ voting blocks and non-voters ] from the poll suggests that a little less than 1 out of 6 American adults believe Barack Obama was n’t born in the US .
A little more than one out of six are n’t sure .
So , nearly one out of three American adults think Barack Obama might not legitimately by president of the United States .
Simply as a question of electoral politics , these numbers should deeply trouble Democratic Party analysts because the gravitational attractor for Americans who believe in " birther " conspiracy theories appears to be the GOP .
There 's nothing on the left that even even remotely compares to the teeming , dense tangle of conspiracy narratives such as birtherism , New World Order and Illuminati conspiracy theories that can be found on the American right .
And , since the election of Barack Obama , New World Order conspiracy narratives claiming Obama is part of the alleged grand New World Order plot have exploded across the Internet ( see Can 100,000 Anti-Obama New World Order Conspiracy Videos Be Wrong ? ] :
" New World Order conspiracy theories are nothing new , but the sheer scale and range of the current outbreak of NWO conspiricism may be unprecedented .
The rise of the Internet and its ability to facilitate homespun rich - media productions has given right wing conspiracy theorists a powerful new tool for spreading anti-government sentiment . "

The Oregon Court of Appeals recently issued an opinion in Abraham v. T. Henry Construction , Inc. , et al. , a residential construction defect case , that helps clarify the circumstances under which a contractor may be sued for negligence .
The issue of whether a contractor may be sued for negligence , as opposed to breach of contract is , in many cases , relevant to a determination of whether the owner ’s claims are barred by the statute of limitations .
Owners often need to rely upon a negligence claim to get past the six - year statute of limitations that applies to claims for breach of contract .
In Jones v. Emerald Pacific Homes , Inc. , which was decided in 2003 , the Oregon Court of Appeals held that an owner who had a contract with a contractor could sue the contractor in negligence if the contractor had breached a standard of care that was independent of any contractual duty or standard of care .
Some courts generally referred to the non-contractual duty or standard of care as a “ special relationship . ”
The Jones opinion then only begged the question of what constituted a special relationship .
In Abraham , the court held that , among other possibilities , a contractor ’s duty to comply with the applicable building code constituted a duty independent of the contract and thereby created the type of special relationship necessary for asserting a negligence claim .
Abraham will be an important tool for owners seeking to pursue construction defect claims in situations in which the owner ’s contract claim has expired due to the six - year statute of limitations , but only in certain types of cases .
The Oregon Legislature recently passed legislation shortening the statute of ultimate repose ( which is different from the statute of limitations ) to six years , for medium to large commercial projects .
As a result , the issue of whether a contractor may be sued for negligence , as opposed to breach of contract , will be relevant only to residential and small commercial projects and the Abraham case will be relevant only to those situations .

Aerospace and aircraft companies as well as the military have been challenged to find ways of effectively shielding sensitive electronic equipment such as radar and radios from electromagnetic interference ( EMI ) without adding a lot of weight to aircraft and satellites ( the more massive they are , the more fuel they need to stay in the air or achieve orbit , respectively ) .
Whereas EMI can lead to headaches like erased data and loss of connectivity for casual computer and cell phone users , the problem is far more serious in aircraft , where interference can jam cockpit radio and radar signals , preventing pilots from sending and receiving crucial information .
Looking to solve this problem on its manned and unmanned aircraft , the U.S. Air Force will by the end of the year to kick off an 18 - month study of the use of carbon nanotube sheets to create a shielding layer on the surfaces of lightweight composites .
Nanocomp Technologies , Inc. , a Concord , N.H. –based maker of carbon nanotube materials , said last this week the Air Force selected the company as prime contractor for the second phase of a larger program intended to find a substitute for the nickel - based conductors currently used for electrostatic discharge ( ESD ) and EMI shielding .
EMI is the result of electromagnetic radiation given off by electronic devices interrupting an electrical circuit 's performance , whereas ESD is the sudden and rapid transfer of an electrostatic charge .
Nanocomp 's carbon nanotube sheets are designed to act as a " Faraday cage " that can block out external static electrical fields from sensitive circuitry .
Because the material can carry electricity , it redirects energy along its conducting plane rather than allowing electronic emissions to penetrate the protected area , the company says .
Although the Air Force will not formally award the contract to Nanocomp for a few weeks , the company , which successfully completed the program 's initial phase earlier this year , is working to scale up volume and decrease the cost of its carbon nanotube –impregnated mats , which can be made as large as 1.2 by 2.4 meters , says Nanocomp CEO Peter Antoinette .
Larger sheets allow for more surface area coverage , reducing the need for seaming or joining and other manufacturing - intensive assembly steps , he adds .
Northrop Grumman Aerospace Systems and Cytec Engineered Materials are also expected to participate in phase two of this program .
The Air Force 's testing of Nanocomp 's sheets is just the latest example of its work with carbon nanotubes .
The U.S. Air Force Research Laboratory 's Materials & Manufacturing Directorate ( ARFL / RX ) , based at Wright –Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton , Ohio , has been investigating applications for carbon nanotubes for at least the past decade , mixing them with polymers in search of stronger , lighter materials that could replace aluminum and even copper wiring , which can represent as much as a third of the aircraft 's total weight .
Sheets of paper or fabric made from carbon nanotubes could prove useful for allowing satellites to safely manage static electricity while in space , particularly because there is no way to provide electrical grounding once they 're in orbit , says Karla Strong , a materials engineer for the Thermal Sciences & Materials branch within the ARFL / RX .
The branch 's engineers research , develop and apply new technologies in an effort to prevent the large amounts of heat produced by increasingly powerful electrical and propulsion systems from damaging aircraft .
The problems with carbon nanotubes have been making them into usable " macromaterials , " says Jennifer Chase Fielding , a materials research engineer with another ARFL / RX branch — Composites & Hybrid Materials — which studies fibers and paper made from carbon nanotubes and nanofibers for ways to leverage their highly thermally and electrically conductive properties .
In addition to studying Nanocomp 's technology , Wright –Patterson researchers spent the past three years evaluating carbon nanotube materials from NanoTechLabs , Inc. , in Yadkinville , N.C. , for possible use as electromagnetic protection films as well as to provide a small amount of electrical conductivity , Strong says .
The Air Force has also taken a close look at " buckypaper " created by researchers at Florida State University 's High - Performance Materials Institute ( HPMI ) .
Buckypaper sheets are made using densely packed single - walled carbon nanotubes .
Carbon nanotubes have specific mechanical properties that make them good candidates for the Air Force 's work , says Ryne Raffaelle , director of the National Center for Photovoltaics at the U.S. Department of Energy 's National Renewable Energy Laboratory .
" In terms of strength - to - weight ratio , carbon nanotubes are stronger than steel but infinitely more flexible , " he says .
A single carbon nanotube is typically about one nanometer in diameter ( the approximate length of 10 atoms ) and millions of times longer than it is wide , says Raffaelle , who previously served as director of the NanoPower Research Laboratory at the Rochester Institute of Technology ( R.I.T. ) in New York State , where he and his team conducted purity assessments of carbon nanotube products , including those made by Nanocomp .
Although Nanocomp and others developing new nanomaterials are on the right track , one of their main challenges will be mass - producing a product with consistent properties .
This wo n't be easy , because each individual carbon nanotube 's conductive properties are dependent on how they are formed , Raffaelle says .
" It would be nice to have every tube the same , " he adds , " but no one can do this . "
There is a tremendous upside for success , however .
Whereas it is possible to poke an ice pick through a piece of Kevlar body armor , Raffaelle says , you could not do this with a piece of fabric made from carbon nanotubes .
For most people , dropping a CD into their disc drive and clicking " Import " in iTunes is good enough .
For music freaks , though , it 's not — and with good reason .
Here 's how to digitize your tunes , the right way .
Advertisement
First off , some reasons to take this road : iTunes is a decent audio encoder , and it 'll get your music from point A — the CD — to points B , C and D — your computer , your MP3 player and your backup drive — without much trouble .
But it 'll do it with a less - than - great encoder , with occasionally inconsistent tagging , with album art that 'll only work on Apple devices , and without support for the best lossless audio formats and MP3 encoding options , which you probably want , whether you know it or not .
In short , the ripping process deserves a little more care than iTunes or Windows Media player can give it .
You can pay people for this , which feels dumb and wasteful , or you can do it yourself .
It 's not difficult , at all .
Here 's what you do :

Get Your Software
G/O Media may get a commission Subscribe and Get Your First Bag Free Promo Code AtlasCoffeeDay20
The first step to ditching iTunes is to , well , ditch iTunes .
What we 're looking for is ripping software that offers more encoding options than iTunes , but more importantly , a better encoder .
And as far as MP3 encoders go , the open source LAME is as good as they get .
There 's plenty of software for both Mac and PC that leverages this encoder , but here are two programs that do lots , lots more .
Mac OS X : Max
From the makers :
When extracting audio from compact discs , Max offers the maximum in flexibility to ensure the true sound of your CD is faithfully extracted .
For pristine discs , Max offers a high - speed ripper with no error correction .
For damaged discs , Max can either use its built - in comparison ripper ( for drives that cache audio ) or the error - correcting power of cdparanoia .
Advertisement
What this translates to : Great error reduction , fantastic sound quality , and tons and tons of encoding options — not that you really need those to do a good rip , but hey , they can't hurt .
On top of all this , Max is also a great file converter , in case you 've got some delinquent WMA files scattered around .
Windows : Exact Audio Copy
From the makers :
Exact Audio Copy is a so called audio grabber for audio CDs using standard CD and DVD - ROM drives .
The main differences between EAC and most other audio grabbers are
• It is free ( for non-commercial purposes )
• It works with a technology , which reads audio CDs almost perfectly .
If there are any errors that can't be corrected , it will tell you on which time position the ( possible ) distortion occurred , so you could easily control it with e.g. the media player
Advertisement
What this translates to :
The best error correction money can buy , for free .
Seriously : Audiophiles swear by exact audio copy , and with good reason .
You 'll have to download your own LAME encoder before you can enable MP3 encoding in the program options , but you can do that right here without a problem .
Additionally , setting up tagging , which you 'll definitely want to do , takes an extra , albeit easy , step .
If you want to take a simpler route you can just download CDex , which supports LAME and tagging databases out of the box , and produces results nearly as good as — if not as good as — Exact Audio Copy .

On both platforms , you 're going to have a lot of personal decisions to make .
How do you want to organize your files ?
How do you want to name them ?
Unlike iTunes , these apps do n't pressure your to store your music in a certain way — it 's up to you to archive as you please .
Both offer plenty of options for storage and organization , easily available in their Preferences menus :
Advertisement
As I said , this one 's up to you .
Choose Your File Type
MP3 : If you 're encoding only for portable devices , not concerned about archiving perfect copies of your music , hate hate hate audiophiles , think FLAC and OGG just sound like gurgling baby noises , you 're probably going to want to stick with MP3s .
Yes , there are other formats that offer a better size - to - sound ratio , and no , it 's not open source or anything , but for pure compatibility , control , and encoder choice , it 's hard — - no , impossible — to beat MP3 .
And if you set up your encoder correctly , MP3s can sound great .

It 's tough to pick the optimal MP3 bitrate on your own , since at a certain point , differences in sound quality seem to come down as much to psychological factors as to actual clarity .
Thankfully , we 've crowd - sourced this issue and come up with a rough guide : 256 k bps is , it seems , where people just can't really tell the difference .
In practical terms , this means setting your encoder to these settings :
Advertisement
Advertisement
That 's no higher than 256 kbps VBR — for variable bitrate , which modifies the amount of information in your file 's stream according to how much is needed , and saves you space without sacrificing quality — with the highest ( read : slowest ) available encoding option .
For almost everyone , in almost all circumstances , this 'll do , and it sure beats iTunes default 160 kbps constant bitrate rips .
FLAC : If archiving is your intention — as in , digitizing your music without losing any quality , no matter how imperceptible — then you 're going to want to go lossless .
And of the lossless formats , FLAC is the most well - supported in terms of software and hardware , albeit not on any of Apple 's products — though iTunes can be made to play nice with FLAC with a few simple tweaks .
Advertisement
But do n't fret !
The beauty of FLAC music is that it can be converted to other lossless formats , like Apple 's iPod-compatible Apple Lossless , without losing any quality , or compressed into MP3s without having to worry about muddy transcoding .
Think of them as CDs without the physical disc , basically .

Embed Your Album Art
Advertisement
This is something else that iTunes does n't do right : album art .
Sure , it 'll find it , but when you transfer all your music to a non -iPod music player , your art is gone .
Why ?
It 's because iTunes stores the album art in a separate database , rather than in the song file 's ID3 tags , where it should be .
On Mac OS , assuming you 're doing your listening in iTunes , which is pretty handy at fetching album art , you can just use one of Doug 's famous iTunes scripts to write said album art directly to your MP3 files .
Here 's how you install it :
To install the files / folders , drag the items in the disc image window to your [ username ] / Library / iTunes / Scripts / folder .
If there is no folder named " Scripts " there , create one and drag the files into it .
AppleScripts placed in this folder will be listed in the iTunes Script menu .
You do not have to install the .rtf / .rtfd documentation file in the " Scripts " folder , but it 's as convenient a place as any .
Advertisement
For Windows users , Lifehacker 's written a fantastic guide to collecting and embedding album art , which you should definitely read .
The short version ?
Download MediaMonkey , and let it do the work for you .
Advertisement
Granted , once you embed album art into your files , apps like iTunes and Windows Media Player might not display it , and may ask you to search for it from their databases .
This is fine :
Both programs use proprietary album art storage systems , so just because they can't see your ID3 tag album art does n't mean it 's not there , or that you should n't have embedded it — having it around can't hurt , and it's by far the most compatible and rational method for storing album art , as far as other software , most MP3 players and long - term storage go .
Anyway , that 's it !
Now you can set your CDs aside comfortably , knowing that you 've squeezed the purest , most delicious audio files you can out of them .
Now :
Listen to Your Music
Because that was the whole point .

A research team led by Lucas Pelkmans at ETH Zürich has managed to decipher a well - known phenomenon that had , until now , remained unexplained : why cells of the same type can react differently , and what the reason for this is .
The properties of a cell population determine the different cell activities observed in cells of the same type .
This is the conclusion drawn by a research team lead by Lucas Pelkmans , professor at the Institute for Molecular Systems Biology at ETH Zürich .
The scientists examined the cause of the well - known phenomenon of cell heterogeneity .
Until now , the reasons behind the different reactions seen in cells of the same type had not been scrutinised .
No random distribution
After three years of intensive development and research work , researchers have developed a computer - supported process , which allows them to observe the processes behind the variability of individual cells in cell cultures with millions of cells for the first time , and uncover the secret behind these processes .
Until now , cell variability was simply called “ noise ” , implying statistical random distribution .
However , the results of the study now show that the different reactions are not random , but that certain causes lead to predictable distribution patterns .
The study has now been published in “ Nature ” and Pelkmans is glad to be reaping the first rewards for the research project , which was supported by ETH Zürich to the sum of 1.8 million Swiss Francs .
“ For the project , we created an automated setup , the RNAi image - based screening centre , which we used to carry out a high turnover of cell experiments ” , Pelkmans explains .
The computer - supported methods were developed in conjunction with the experiments and allow the phenotypes of the cells to be quantified and described automatically .
The data is fed into models and used to show how individual cell properties develop and affect each other .
The scientists focused their study on the cell properties predetermined by the population of the cell culture .
This includes , for example , the size of the population , the local cell density , the size of an individual cell , whether the cell is on the edge of the cell culture and therefore not limited by another cell on one side , whether the cell is in the process of duplicating its nucleus ( mitosis ) or whether it is in the process of so - called programmed cell death .
Collecting large volumes of data
For each cell , the scientists examined the variety in endocytosis activity , by which cells invaginate parts of its biological membrane and absorbs the surrounding medium .
They further looked at the variable amounts of a certain fat molecule ( sphingolipid ) on the surface of the cell , which plays an important role in relaying the cell ’s signals and reactions .
They also infected the cell culture with three different viruses and observed the differences in progression of the infection .
“ We created a multivariable analysis of individual cells and obtained a very large number of very different readings ” , Pelkmans explains .
With this huge volume of data , the researchers used computer models to determine which variables affect each other .
This allowed them to establish many rules , coined “ heterogeneity signatures ” by the scientists , which describe the way in which population - dependant properties of a cell culture influence cell reactions in the models .
Properties of the cell cultures determine variability
As the next step , the scientists tested how well the models would be able to predict the reactions of the cell .
It was shown that this is possible with a high degree of accuracy and that the variability is clearly determined by the properties of the cell population .
The cell cultures are naturally different from one another , explaining the broad variation in reactions of individual cells in the respective cell cultures during endocytosis and viral infections .
For example , endocytosis is more uniform and is easier to control when the cell culture is densely populated , and certain diarrhoea - causing viruses can infect a less densely populated cell area more easily .
The findings are of particular significance for research using comparative cell cultures : “ This is one of the most important methods , but at the same time also one that poses big problems for cell biologists ” , says Pelkmans .
The study has shown that reactions in two cell cultures can be better compared when the models to predict these reactions in each cell culture are used as a reference , taking into account the effect of the properties of a cell population of at least ten thousand cells .
This is an important aspect , for example , for the pharmaceutical industry .
As the study shows , many changes do not directly influence the cell , but the population as a whole , which then leads to changes in behaviour of individual cells .
A new study http://www. cmaj. ca/ press / cmaj082068 . pdf in CMAJ ( Canadian Medical Association Journal ) www.cmaj.ca suggests that air pollution may trigger appendicitis in adults .
The study , conducted by researchers at the University of Calgary , University of Toronto and Health Canada , looked at 5191 adults admitted to hospital in Calgary , Alberta , Canada .
Fifty - two per cent of admissions occurred between April and September , the warmest months of the year in Canada during which people are more likely to be outside .
The dominant theory of the cause of appendicitis has been obstruction of the appendix opening , but this theory does not explain the trends of appendicitis in developed and developing countries .
Appendicitis cases increased dramatically in industrialized countries in the 19th and early 20th centuries , then decreased in the middle and late 20th century , coinciding with legislation to improve air quality .
The incidence of appendicitis has been growing in developing countries as they become more industrialized .
Using Environment Canada 's air pollution data for Calgary , the researchers determined the levels of ozone , nitrogen dioxide and other air - borne pollutants along with temperature .
They found correlations between high levels of ozone and nitrogen dioxide and the incidence of appendicitis between age groups and genders .
More men than women were found to have the condition .
" For unexplained reasons , men are more likely than women to have appendicitis , " write Dr. Gilaad Kaplan of the University of Calgary and coauthors .
" Men may be more susceptible to the effects of outdoor air pollution because they are more likely to be employed in outdoor occupations , " although they note that misclassifications of data could explain some of the difference .
While it is not known how air pollution may increase the risk of appendicitis , the authors suggest pollutants may trigger inflammatory responses .
They recommend further studies to determine the link .

There ’s only one spot on Earth to open this wedding gift .
It comes in a small , carved wooden box — equipped with a GPS circuit — that wo n’t unlatch until it ’s taken to a pre-set mystery location .
And the recipient has to figure out where that is .
It sounds like something from “ Mission : Impossible ” or a James Bond movie , but this is a real gift made by software engineer Mikal Hart for a friend who was getting married and moving to France .
And it has to rank as one of the most mysterious , geekiest and most delightful wedding presents of the year .
“ I ’ve always been fascinated with puzzle solving , and I thought something fun could be done with GPS , ” said Hart , 46 , who works for computer - chip maker Intel Corp. in Austin , Texas .
He bought the box , festooned with a carved elephant , at a World Market store .
A little digital screen , push button and GPS chip were mounted on the lid .
Inside went the rest of the electronics and a little motor for the latch .
The box was delivered with no instructions .
When the button is pushed , a message comes on the screen giving a distance in kilometers .
It also shows the number of button pushes — the maximum allowed is 50 .
Hart hopes that his friend , who received the box last month , will figure out that the distance on the screen is a GPS - derived calculation of how far he is from the target spot in France .
With three clear readings , he could triangulate to find the goal .
Here ’s hoping he ’s not reading this — it ’s the Ile - de - Brehat , a small island off the coast of France where the couple met .
Upon arrival , the motor will automatically turn on to free the latch .
“ What would be better than to get in a boat and go to the island to open the box , ” Hart said .
The gifts inside had to be small to fit — they ’re mostly gift cards .
But if it ’s the thought that counts , this gift is priceless .
“ It took me nine months , off and on , to figure it out and build it , ” Hart said .
As people discover his site , he ’s getting requests for boxes .
“ I was set up to make only one , ” he said , “ but people are asking . ”

This past week the Supreme Court heard arguments about whether children should ever be sentenced to life without parole for crimes that do n’t involve murder .
At the heart of the argument lies a vexing question :
When should a person be treated as an adult ?
The answer , generally , is 18 — the age when the United States , and the rest of the world , considers young people capable of accepting responsibility for their actions .
But there are countless deviations from this benchmark , both around the world ( the bar mitzvah , for instance ) , and within the United States .
For drinking , driving , fighting in the military , compulsory schooling , watching an R - rated movie , consenting to sex , getting married , having an abortion or even being responsible for your own finances , the dawn of adulthood in America is all over the place .
And if you think separating the men from the boys ( or the women from the girls ) is difficult today , tracing the history of America ’s conception of childhood just complicates things further .

The Osiris camera system pictures the illuminated crescent of Earth
Europe 's Rosetta spacecraft has made its third and final flyby of Earth , a manoeuvre designed to position the probe to chase down a comet in 2014 .
The spacecraft 's whip around the planet will have given it the extra speed it needs to take it out to the rendezvous location near Jupiter .
Launched in 2004 , Rosetta had already flown by Earth twice and Mars once .
The journey out to Comet 67P / Churyumov - Gerasimenko will also take the probe past an asteroid in 2010 .
Rosetta was expected to be moving at some 13 km / s as it swept over the Indian Ocean , just south of the Indonesian island of Java .
At closest approach it reached an altitude of just 2,480 km , well inside the orbits of geostationary telecoms satellites .
Journey ahead Engineers say the gravity - assist will have increased Rosetta 's speed by almost 4 km /s with respect to the Sun .
Scientists used the flyby to test the health of some of Rosetta 's instruments by making observations of the Earth and the Moon .
Rosetta has already visited one asteroid on its Solar System tour Osiris , the main scientific camera system , took a series pictures .
Engineers will assess the probe 's trajectory to see if any course corrections are required .
Any changes will be easier and lighter on fuel if they are made as early as possible .
The mission is expected to make a flyby of Asteroid Lutetia in July 2010 , but apart from that one event the long journey into the outer Solar System should be a quiet one .
Indeed , for much of the time , the spacecraft will be put in a hibernation mode .
Long history Rosetta 's meeting with Churyumov - Gerasimenko is set for the May of 2014 .
The probe will go into orbit around the 4 km - wide ball of ice and dust and place a small lander called Philae on its surface .
As the comet moves into the inner Solar System , radiation from the Sun will cause the comet 's ices to sublime - they will turn straight from a solid to a gas .
Material will be ejected at supersonic speeds .
Gas and dust will be thrown out around the comet to form a coma , and away from the comet to form tails .
The Rosetta orbiter and lander will watch and record these events as the comet hurtles along at speeds up to 135,000 km / h .
Scientists are keen to study comets close up because they are thought to contain materials that have remained largely unchanged since the formation of the Solar System 4.6 bn years ago .
Rosetta milestones : • Launch : 2 March 2004 • First Earth swingby : 4 March 2005 • Mars swingby : 25 February 2007 • Second Earth swingby : 13 November 2007 • Steins flyby : 5 September 2008 • Third Earth swingby : 13 November 2009 • Lutetia flyby : 10 July 2010 • Comet rendezvous manoeuvres : 22 May 2014 • Lander delivery : 10 November 2014 • Escorting the comet around the Sun : November 2014 - December 2015 • End of mission : December 2015 Jonathan .Amos-INTERNET@bbc.co.uk

For the first time in almost 35 years , there will be no cost of living increase in Social Security payments .
In the predictable “ something must be done about this [ so called ] problem ” mentality of this administration , President Obama has proposed sending $ 250 checks to over 50 million seniors to help them cope with their financial woes .
The problem here is that there is a very good and simple reason why there is not going to be an increase in Social Security payments : prices have dropped by 2.1 % since the fall of 2008 , meaning that the money that seniors already get from Social Security actually buys more goods and services than it did last year .
On top of this , the Social Security Administration has already given seniors a large increase in their payments this year : in January , seniors received a 5.8 % boost in their payments , the largest increase since 1982 .
Once again , President Obama is using misguided “ logic ” to support his own political goals .
Social Security payments are indexed to price inflation , however , they are not allowed to be decreased , meaning that a decrease in prices actually makes seniors much better off .
I understand that many seniors are suffering in this recession .
Many have lost a great deal of their savings due to the collapse in stock prices .
However , Congress decided over three decades ago that Social Security payments would be linked to the cost of living .
Besides the obvious reason of guaranteeing seniors a livable income , Congress likely had another reason for guaranteeing the benefits : they wanted to take the decision out of the hands of the political process .
Right or wrong , it will be very difficult for members of Congress to vote against the $ 250 payment for seniors .
For one , seniors are a vulnerable group , many of whom are living only on their fixed Social Security payments .
Seniors also vote–a lot .
As a group , they historically have the highest rates of voter turnout .
I firmly believe that this bill should be voted down .
For one , President Obama ’s proposal to send checks to seniors is addressing a problem that doesnt actually exist : seniors can buy more for their money than they could a year ago .
Additionally , these payments will cost roughly $ 13,000,000,000 [ $ 13 billion ] in money that the government does not have .
The money being spent on this non-existent problem will have to be expropriated from hard working citizens or printed out of thin air ( devaluing the savings and earnings of anyone who does not receive a payment ) .
This “ something must be done ” mentality is flat out wrong .
Many supporters of the bailouts , stimulus , and other interventionist policies defend them not on moral or economic grounds , but rather defend them by saying that “ at least they are trying something . ”
This mentality has brought this once great Nation to the brink of bankruptcy and has brought government regulation into nearly every single aspect of daily life .
We can only hope that enough members of Congress will do the right thing and oppose these payments .

Chrysler , the U.S. - funded , Italian - run , formerly bankrupt American automaker is leaking its product plans , ahead of their official unveiling in November .
Automotive News [ sub ] confirms that Sergio Marchionne ’s minions have decided to spin off Ram trucks into a separate brand , removing the company ’s most profitable product from underneath the Dodge umbrella .
For once , AN ( or at least its mysterious person of interest ) understands the full implications .
“ The separation of the Ram truck brand will allow Fiat to make Dodge more of a performance car brand , the person said .
But the move could also make it easier for Chrysler to spin off its truck business down the road if a continuing slump forced Fiat or U.S. officials to consider such a step . ”
Did you see that ?
“ U.S. officials . ”
Pay some attention to the Presidential Task Force behind that curtain !
In any case , Chrysler and GM are heading into a perfect storm : continued market share erosion , new product constipation and chaos and , sopra tutti , cash burn .
Never mind that GM IPO FUD , or the back door billions shoveled GM and Chrysler ’s way via subsidies , low - cost loans , union health care bailouts , the PBGC Delphi dance and tax breaks .
Both automakers ’ only real hope of long - term survival is the same as it ’s been since last spring : your taxes .
What are the odds that Uncle Sam will re-up ?
Of course , timing is .
Everything .
Questions , questions , questions .
Does either carmaker have enough cash in the kitty to make it past the mid-term elections without a fresh federal infusion ?
And if the Democrats get their asses kicked , will the new , fiscally conservative Republicans bailout Motown again ( not forgetting that it was George W. Bush who started this whole debacle ) ?
For those of you who say the Obama ’s army never really intended to rescue either automaker , that they were simply subsidizing the companies to facilitate a soft landing , I say bullshit .
Washington ’s big swinging dicks , led by private equity money men with a similar anatomical affliction , honestly thought they could “ fix ” Detroit .
Any other reading of the situation would be deeply cynical , and you know how I feel about that .
In any case , it ’s only a matter of time before Chrysler , and then GM , are parted out .
Without a new new new round of bailouts , look for the Big Two to go down by the end of next year .
Your take ?
Ric Flair is reportedly set to wrestle Hulk Hogan in Australia and end his retirement .
Flair signed a three - year deal to wrestle Hogan several times internationally .
Yes , Ric Flair will be wrestling at 63 .
Flair has officially made a mockery of himself , Shawn Michaels , his peers , the WWE , and his fans .
Brett Favre ’s got nothing on the Nature Boy .
Wooo !
Flair will be coming out of retirement to wrestle Hulk Hogan in Australia .
Hogan and Eric Bischoff are promoting an Australian pro wrestling tour featuring Hogan , Flair , Ken Anderson , Umaga , and others .
The show is scheduled to take place in November .
This will be Hogan ’s first wrestling match since wrestling the Big Show in 2007 .
Hogan promoted the show himself which bombed miserably .
Thus far Hogan is 0 - 1 in the rasslin promoting business .
This will be Flair ’s first match since his legendary WrestleMania 24 Retirement Match against Shawn Michaels .
Flair has given one of the greatest sendoffs in pro wrestling history on WWE RAW the following night .
Shortly thereafter Flair started making waves about wanting to wrestle again .
Flair did have a Street Fight against Randy Orton on WWE RAW , but that was the closest he has gotten to putting on the boots .
Flair ’s career post - WrestleMania has been an absolute joke .
Flair started doing shows for Ring of Honor .
ROH reportedly paid Flair upfront for several dates in excess of well over six - figures .
Flair then reportedly backed out of the dates which were paid for .
Some reports have indicated that Flair is all but broke following his divorce last year .
For a guy who admittedly loves to live life like the Nature Boy , Ric Flair has not had the easiest time financially over the last few years .
Before you feel sorry for Ric Flair , let ’s look deeper into this .
Flair has been in tax trouble numerous times over his career .
Flair took out an $ 800,000 loan from Vince McMahon a couple of years back .
Flair turned down a job for an estimated $ 35,000 a month from the WWE to do public relations .
Flair still loves to limousine ride and jet fly even with no steady pro wrestling income .
Ric
Flair is not someone you should be feeling sorry for .
Flair has talked about wrestling for over a year now .
In Ric Flair ’s convoluted world , Flair believes that by wrestling internationally that he is not going back on his word .
Even Flair ’s best friends like Triple H and Barry Windham have publicly criticized him for this .
Barry Windham told me personally that the shame of it all is that Vince McMahon will never give a sendoff like the one Flair got on WWE RAW again .
Why would he ?
I also love the irony here of Flair coming back to wrestle for Hulk Hogan and Eric Bischoff .
Flair trashed both of these guys in his book .
Flair has accused Hogan of trying to shoot on his son and sabotaging him during their WCW run .
Flair ’s problems with Bischoff are well documented .
Yet , Flair is happy to do business with two guys that he has had rocky relationships with over the years .
Before talking about Bret Hart and his integrity , Ric Flair needs to take a hard look in the mirror .
Maybe Bischoff can finally bankrupt Ric Flair ?
The Australian tour and future shows are scheduled to tie into a reality TV series .
Well , Flair finally got his wish to be on a reality show .
I just think it is funny that after losing his marriage , his son ’s troubles , and losing millions to Linda , that Hogan would want any part of a reality show .
There is something a little off about like Hogan who continues to seek out these reality TV opportunities .
I do hope they continue this venture for another five years .
I ’d love to see a 65 - year old Ric Flair running around a hotel lobby in a robe , wooing , and cashing a social security check .
The truth of the matter is that I loved Ric Flair when I was a kid .
As an adult , I never missed a Flair moment on television .
In the wrestling ring or behind a mic , he is my favorite of all - time .
However , this news is just latest in the sad and disappointing tailspin of one of our wrestling heroes .
Never has a wrestler had the endearing support of his fans and peers like Ric Flair had .
Never has a wrestler done more to spit on all of them than Ric Flair has .
For the sake of Hulkamania , I hope Hogan and Bischoff did n’t pay Flair upfront .

Back in August , there was reportedly considerable hand - wringing among Bush ’s inner circle about the tell - all account soon to be released by George W. Bush ’s former speechwriter , Matt Latimer , about his time in the Oval Office .
And , it turns out , it was maybe for good reason .
GQ snagged some excerpts of the book , Speech Less : Tales of a White House Survivor , and the portrait it paints of the ex-president ( and his advisers ) , is , though not horrible , often unflattering .
But not always !
Herewith , the top ten things we learned about Dubya .
10 . Bush Wears Crocs : Particularly when he practices speeches .
9. Bush Nicknamed Speechwriter Jonathan Horn “ Horny ” :
This is not surprising at all , just funny .
8. Bush Is Arrogant About Things He Should n’t Be Arrogant About : “ I know it sounds arrogant to say , ” he told Latimer , “ but I redefined the Republican Party . ”
Uh , yeah , you made it into something that nobody wanted to vote for .
7. Bush Is n’t As Good at Delivering FDR - type Lines As FDR : White House counsel Fred Fielding , writes Latimer ,
6. Bush Takes Pride in Thinking Up Very Simple Jokes :
“ Dana , did you tell them my line ? ” the president once asked with a smile on his face .
“ No , Mr. President , ” Dana [ Perino ] replied hesitantly .
“ I did n’t . ”
5. Bush Refers to People As “ Cat ” : “ We got to make this understandable for the average cat , ” he said of one speech .
Another time , talking about candidate Barack Obama , Bush said , “ This is a dangerous world , and this cat is n’t remotely qualified to handle it . ”
Relatedly …
4. Bush Did n’t Have Much Regard for Barack Obama : Continuing his assessment of Obama , Bush remarked , “ This guy has no clue , I promise you . ”
3. Bush Thought Hillary Was Fat , Would Become President : Latimer writes : “ ‘ Wait till her fat keister is sitting at this desk , ’ [ Bush ] once said ( except he did n’t say ‘ keister ’ ) . ”
We bet he said ass !
2. Bush Didn’t Understand His Administration ’s Own Economic Proposals : “ We ’re buying low and selling high , ” Bush kept saying about the Treasury ’s plan to snap up troubled mortgages .
Eventually , Bush , exasperated , delivers a classic line : “ Why did I sign on to this proposal if I do n’t understand what it does ? ” he asked .
1. Bush Was Remarkably Prescient About Sarah Palin : Right after Palin was selected as John McCain ’s running mate , amid the euphoria of his White House advisers , Bush delivered what would become a spot - on assessment of her liabilities .
“ This woman is being put into a position she is not even remotely prepared for , ” he said .
“ She has n’t spent one day on the national level .
Neither has her family .
Let ’s wait and see how she looks five days out . ”
Never mind the fact that Bush , when he ran for president , also lacked experience on the national level .
The guy nailed that one .
ME TALK PRESIDENTIAL ONE DAY [ GQ ]
Police in Alice Springs say would - be robbers picked the wrong victim to accost at the weekend .
A 20 - year - old German woman was one of a group of tourists attacked by several people on the Wills Terrace footbridge on Saturday evening .
But Superintendent Sean Parnell told 783 ABC
Alice Springs the woman was a black belt in karate .
" The victim there managed to punch one of the offenders three times in the face with a karate chop , " he said .
" And they then attempted to run away and these baddies chased them and she 's swung around and given them a kick to the side of the head and a couple more karate chops and they 've run away . "
He says she may have injured at least one of the attackers while fighting off the assault .
" We believe that , given the force she 's hit him with , that he may have some injuries , " he said .
" Be careful who you pick . "
Die Stadt Augsburg hat einen Blogger wegen Verletzung ihres Namensrechts abgemahnt , weil der Mann die Domain „ augsburgr.de “ registriert hatte .
Das schreibt die Augsburger Allgemeine :
Er meldete also die Adresse augsburgr.de an – und schrieb dann an die Stadt : „ Wir haben die Domain augsburgR.de im Internet registriert .
Um juristische Probleme mit der Stadt Augsburg zu vermeiden , bitten wir um eine schriftliche Genehmigung , diesen Namen verwenden zu dürfen “ , hieß es in seiner E - Mail an das OB - Referat .
Doch eine Genehmigung gab es nicht .
Stattdessen flatterte dem jungen Blogger am 25 .
Oktober ein Anwaltsbrief ins Haus – eine Abmahnung .
Der Jurist forderte Fleischmann im Namen und im Auftrag der Stadt Augsburg auf , die Domain augsburgr .de sofort zu löschen .
Durch die Benutzung der Domain werde das Namensrecht der Stadt Augsburg verletzt .
Fleischmann habe eine „ Namensanmaßung “ begangen , verwende die Domain widerrechtlich und überhaupt könnten Menschen ja die Stadt Augsburg mit dem Blog augsburgr.de in Verbindung bringen – was so nicht sein dürfe .
Daraufhin kündigte Michael Fleischmann die Domain wieder – und dachte , „ der Fall sei damit erledigt “ .
Das erwies sich vor einigen Tagen als Trugschluss , als ihm die Stadt Augsburg eine Kostennote über die entstandenen Anwaltskosten in Höhe von 1890,91 Euro zusandte .
Besonders dreist ist , dass es dazu hieß :
Wir weisen darauf hin , dass es sich bei dem angesetzten Streitwert von € 50.000,00 um einen entgegenkommend niedrigen Betrag handelt .
„ Üblich “ seien in solchen Fällen sonst 100.000 bis 150.000 Euro Streitwert .
Bei der Stadt versteht man den Ärger des Abgemahnten nicht und besteht darauf , dass eine Namensrechtsverletzung vorlag : „ Er hat uns mit seiner E - Mail Anfang Oktober nicht um Erlaubnis gefragt , sondern uns in Kenntnis gesetzt , als er die Rechtsverletzung bereits begangen hatte “ , sagt Jurist Joachim Pfeilsticker vom OB - Referat der Stadt .
Er verteidigt zudem , dass für die auf Fleischmanns Anfrage hin verschickte Abmahnung ein externer Anwalt eingeschaltet wurde , obwohl die Stadt selbst Juristen beschäftigt : „ Es handelte sich dabei um sehr spezielle Rechtsfragen “ , zudem sei es auch „ recht und billig , dass für die Anwaltskosten der Verursacher aufkommt , nicht der Steuerzahler . “
Auffällig ist , dass er eine Reihe weiterer , bisher unbehelligter Domains gibt , die sich in ähnlicher Weise des Stadtnamens bedienen , wie Fleischmann berichtet : „ Es gibt augsburger.de , augs - burg.de , auxburg.de , augsburgre .de und andere “ .
Das soll sich allerdings nun ändern , hat der Stadt - Jurist Pfeilsticker gegenüber der Augsburger Allgemeinen angekündigt : „ Wir werden die Sachverhalte prüfen und dann entsprechende Veranlassungen treffen “ .
Update von Markus : Die Stadt rudert jetzt zurück und der Oberbürgermeister hat erklärt , das rechtlich alles in Ordnung gewesen sei , aber man von der Kostennote Abstand nehmen würde .

The book tour starts this week , and I look forward to it !
I 'm most looking forward to meeting many of you , shaking your hands , and telling you , " Thanks for loving America . "
I 'll give you a scoop here and tell you what 's on the book 's Dedication Page – it 's dedicated to you – Patriots – who love the U.S.A. as much as I do .
Amazingly , but not surprisingly , the AP somehow nabbed a copy of the book before it was released .
They 're now erroneously reporting on the book 's contents and are repeating many of the same things they spewed during the campaign and afterwards .
We 've heard 11 writers are engaged in this opposition research , er , " fact checking " research !
Imagine that – 11 AP reporters dedicating time and resources to tearing up the book , instead of using the time and resources to " fact check " what 's going on with Sheik Mohammed 's trial , Pelosi 's health care takeover costs , Hasan 's associations , etc. Amazing .
We 'll keep setting the record straight , and we 'll keep reminding some in the media that Americans are very tired of their non-objective reporting .
A great , recent post that accomplishes this is a Conservatives4 Palin post .
It 's got some nice fact checking included .
As always , they did a great job holding some of the media accountable for spreading more misinformation and for making things up .
You can read it here .
Enjoy !
And I can't wait to see you !
God bless the fight for freedom !
Keep up the great work , Patriots who love this country .
Bereits im April suchten die G20 in London nach Auswegen aus der Krise .
Der britische Premier Gordon Brown verkündete danach " eine neue Weltordnung " .
In Pittsburgh findet nun ein Folgetreffen der G20 statt .
Kurz vor dem Treffen der weltweit wichtigsten Industrie und Schwellenländer ( G20 ) zur Regulierung der Finanzmärkte sind die Erwartungen gedämpft .
" Die wichtigen Fragen sind noch gar nicht angesprochen worden " , kritisiert der Wirtschaftsexperte Henrik Enderlein gegenüber n- tv.de .
" Wir sind noch nicht weit genug gekommen bei einer globalen Bankenregulierung , bei einem globalen Ansatz , Märkte stärker unter politische Kontrolle zu stellen . "
Der große Strukturwandel , " die Jahrhundertreaktion auf die Jahrhundertkrise " haben laut Enderlein bislang nicht stattgefunden .
Auch in Zukunft könnten Regulierungen weitere Crashs nicht verhindern .
" Die Regulierung wird den Bank - Instituten immer so hinterherhinken wie Doping - Agenturen den Sportlern " , so der Dozent an der Hertie School of Governance in Berlin .
Enderlein fordert eine globale unabhängige Instanz zur Kontrolle der internationalen Finanzmärkte .
" Was wir brauchen ist aber das supranationale Interesse , das im Sinne der Weltbevölkerung die Finanzmärkte und die Weltwirtschaft besser unter Kontrolle bringt . "
Nur so ließen sich nationale Interessen überwinden .
Dass sich über den G20 - Kontext eine solche Gemeinschaft bildet , sieht der Wirtschaftsexperte zurzeit nicht .
" Vielleicht ist die Krise dafür - auch wenn es zynisch klingt - zu kurz gewesen .
Der Problemdruck geht wieder zurück , übergeordnete Interessen verlieren wieder an Gewicht . "
Henrik Enderlein , Jahrgang 1974 , lehrt politische Ökonomie an der Hertie School of Governance in Berlin .
n-tv.de : In Pittsburgh treffen sich am 24 .
und 25 .
September die 20 wichtigsten Industrie und Schwellenländer , die G20 .
Ihr Ziel ist es , die Finanzmärkte stärker zu regulieren .
Wird es einen Crash wie im vergangenen Jahr also künftig nicht mehr geben ?
Durch die Krise hat weltweit schon Millionen Jobs gekostet .
( Foto : AP )
Henrik Enderlein : Crashs wird es immer wieder geben , keine Regulierung kann das verhindern .
Die Regulierung wird den Bank - Instituten immer so hinterherhinken wie Doping - Agenturen den Sportlern : Wenn die Doping - Agentur eine verbotene Substanz feststellen kann , haben die Sportler schon wieder eine neue .
Genauso verhält es sich zwischen Regulierern und Banken .
Grundsätzlich sind Krisen auch Teil des Kapitalismus und sollten deshalb nicht verteufelt werden .
Was wir derzeit erleben , ist eine Jahrhundertkrise , bei der viele Dinge zusammenkommen .
Jetzt würde ich daher nicht darüber reden , wie man so eine Krise verhindern kann , sondern lieber nach vorne gucken und mir überlegen , wie man aus der Krise herauskommt .
Welche Rezepte sehen Sie da ?
IWF - Chef Strauss - Kahn möchte den IWF stärken .

Die wichtigen Fragen sind noch gar nicht angesprochen worden .
Man hat sich mit vielen kleinen Aspekten beschäftigt : Die Boni von Bankern oder Managergehälter sind sicherlich Stellschrauben in dem großen Ganzen , aber es sind nicht die entscheidenden Stellschrauben .
Ich glaube , wir sind noch nicht weit genug gekommen bei einer globalen Bankenregulierung , bei einem globalen Ansatz , Märkte stärker unter politische Kontrolle zu stellen .
Wir sind auch nicht weiter gekommen bei der Frage , wie man eine Regierbarkeit der Weltwirtschaft und der Weltfinanzmärkte herstellen kann .
Solange das nicht geklärt ist , werden wir weiter mit der Paradoxie leben müssen , dass die Krise global ist , die Antworten aber national sind .
Nationale Antworten bleiben also unwirksam ?
Nehmen Sie das Beispiel dieser Börsenumsatzsteuer , die von Peer Steinbrück und Frank - Walter Steinmeier vorgeschlagen wurde .
Eine solche Regelung ließe sich nur umsetzen , wenn sich alle Länder daran beteiligen .
Wenn auch nur ein Land ausschert , werden alle Geschäfte über dieses Land abgewickelt werden .
Genauso ist es auch mit der Bankenregulierung .
Wenn in einem Land laxere Regeln gelten als in anderen , dann wird dieses Land überproportional davon profitieren , dass sich Banken an diesem Finanzplatz niederlassen .
Insofern brauchen wir eine Aufsichtsinstanz im internationalen Kontext , die dafür sorgt , dass solche individualistischen Vorgehensweisen von Ländern sich nicht durchsetzen .
IWF - Chef Dominique Strauss - Kahn fordert , dass internationale Organisationen wie der Internationale Währungsfonds ( IWF ) oder die Weltbank mehr Befugnisse bekommen .
Ist das ein Weg ?
Der Crash im vergangenen Jahr hatte weltweit verheerende Auswirkungen .
( Foto : AP )
Der IWF hat keine Krise der vergangenen 20 bis 30 Jahre korrekt vorhergesagt , geschweige denn dazu beigetragen , dass solche Krisen verhindert werden können .
Das war bei der lateinamerikanischen Schuldenkrise so , bei der Asienkrise , beim Dot -Com - Crash und das war auch bei der jetzigen Krise so .
Wenn eine Institution so oft daneben liegt , dann sollte man ihr nicht zusätzliche Kompetenzen übertragen und hoffen , dass sich das in Zukunft ändert .
Der IWF - ähnlich wie die Weltbank - steht für eine Aufaddierung von nationalen Interessen .
Was wir brauchen ist aber das supranationale Interesse , das im Sinne der Weltbevölkerung die Finanzmärkte und die Weltwirtschaft besser unter Kontrolle bringt .
Das kann meiner Ansicht nach nur ein neues , ein unabhängiges Gremium .
Was aber erst gebildet werden müsste .
Was wahrscheinlich auch nicht morgen entstehen wird , aber wir sollten den Wunsch nicht aufgeben , eine solche unabhängige Instanz in internationalen Währungs - und Finanzfragen aufzubauen .
Im Sicherheitsbereich haben wir den Sicherheitsrat der Vereinten Nationen , im Handel gibt es die Welthandelsorganisation , in der regionalen Integration Europas die Europäische Kommission .
Wir müssen akzeptieren , dass die Globalisierung Märkte hervorgebracht hat , die sich über die nationale Politik nicht mehr steuern lassen .
Sehen Sie schon Ansätze für eine Interessengemeinschaft dieser Art ?
Ich hatte gehofft , dass sich über den G20 - Kontext eine solche Gemeinschaft bildet .
Das haben wir bis jetzt nicht gesehen .
Vielleicht ist die Krise dafür - auch wenn es zynisch klingt - zu kurz gewesen .
Im Augenblick geht der Problemdruck wieder zurück , übergeordnete Interessen verlieren wieder an Gewicht .
Das ist schade .
Ich hätte mir gewünscht , dass eine Dynamik entsteht , um endlich so etwas wie globale ökonomische Governance aufzubauen .
Das heißt , letztlich ist nach der Krise alles wie vor der Krise .
In Einzelbereichen hat es sicherlich Fortschritte oder Entwicklungen ergeben .
Das sind technische Dinge , die Kapitalvorschriften für Banken betreffen , das sind auch institutionelle Aspekte wie der Aufbau dieses G20 - Rahmens , aber das sind nur kleine Schritte und kosmetische Veränderungen .
Der große Strukturwandel , die Jahrhundertreaktion auf die Jahrhundertkrise hat nicht stattgefunden .
Wie lang wird uns die Krise noch begleiten ?
Es gibt zwei mögliche Szenarien .
Das erste Szenario ist , dass die Krise jetzt langsam vorüberzieht .
Aber selbst wenn das so wäre , stünde uns eine soziale Krise über Arbeitslosigkeit , über steigenden Ungleichheiten in unseren Gesellschaften , aber auch global zwischen armen und reichen Ländern noch bevor .
Wohlgemerkt : Das ist das positive Szenario .
Das negative ist , dass wir eine so genannte W - Rezession sehen .
Das leitet sich aus der Grafik des Buchstaben W ab :
Wir haben einen ersten Knick nach unten , dann einen leichten Anstieg , und dann geht es zum zweiten Mal nach unten .
Diese doppelte Rezession ist noch keineswegs ausgeschlossen .
Es kann sein , dass wir 2010 oder vielleicht noch in diesem Jahr einen zweiten Rückschlag erleben werden , ausgelöst von Banken , die keine Kredite vergeben , und von der zweiten Welle beim Konsumeinbruch .
Wenn das kommt , kann kein Mensch sagen , wie lange diese Krise noch anhalten wird .
Das kann auch bis 2011 oder 2012 dauern .
Mit Henrik Enderlein sprach Gudula Hörr
It seems like any action ( or inaction ) by President Obama , spawns another “ non-controversy ” complete with a new surge of manufactured rage .
Sometimes … the issue does n’t involve the President ’s actions at all , as is the case with recent clips that surfaced … showing schoolchildren mentioning Obama in songs they performed as part of Black History Month back in February .
Fox News and other members of the right - wing media apparatus were quick to label the clips “ unprecedented ” and “ indoctrination “ … despite the fact that the President was certainly in no way responsible , the clips were clearly inoffensive and represented positive behavior in schoolchildren ( we WANT them singing about studying hard and helping their country ) , and similar clips of schoolchildren singing about former President Bush also existed .
And now , just another example that the right will literally grasp at ANY subject to serve as a platform for their contempt : The Olympics .
Plans had already been in the works for First Lady Michelle Obama to attend the meeting of the International Olympic Committee in Denmark , in hopes of swaying IOC voters towards selecting Chicago , Illinois as the home for the 2016 Summer Olympics .
As the voting date drew closer , it became apparent that Chicago was in a tight race with Rio de Janeiro , Brazil … Madrid , Spain …and Tokyo , Japan .
At present , the IOC seems to be leaning towards Chicago , since it takes a lot of money to host the Olympics , and the committee feels a bit more secure ( given the worldwide recession ) in picking a location in the United States .
However , due to the complicated and political voting process , it is still ( literally ) anybody ’s game .
The decision was made : President Obama would also fly in to Copenhagen on Friday , the day of the vote , when he and the other countries ’ representatives would each be given 45 minutes to speak before the voting process begins .
And THAT’S when the latest faux conspiracy was born …
Fox News ‘ talking heads ( Hannity / O’ Reilly / Beck ) went into immediate overdrive .
They asked :
With two wars , a recession , and a health care debate going on …does the President really have time to be jetting to Denmark to try to lobby for the Olympics to be held in America ?
On Sean Hannity ’s show , guest Michelle Malkin went one step further in suggesting that the entire effort was merely a ploy by Obama to line the pockets of corrupt Chicago “ cronies : ”
The White House ’s response was simple and elegant : they posted an item - by - item “ Reality Check ” responding to each ridiculous claim , and in each response they identified the claim ’s source ( whether a Fox personality , or a guest on a Fox show ) by name .
Here is that blog …
Republican National Committee Chairman Michael Steele also tried to level criticism at the decision for the President to make the trip : perhaps not realizing that construction and planning for the 2016 Olympics would have to start IMMEDIATELY , Steele made the statement , “ If the priority is the Olympics in seven years , okay , then tell the nation that ’s the priority and that ’s what we should be focused on because we ’ll create jobs then and we wo n’t worry about it between now and 2016 . “
White House Press Secretary Gibbs provided a response to Steele ’s noticeably snarky attack :
Of course , there are some obvious FACTS that reveal just how petty and wrong - headed these attacks are :
1 - The entire trip is going to take 18 hours … during most of which , Obama will be on Air Force One and able to conduct other presidential business .
I think he can spare the time .
2 - This is not unusual .
In the past , whenever countries are in a close race to obtain the vote , Presidents and Prime Ministers of these countries would OFTEN attend the IOC meeting .
These appeals can be very VERY influential in terms of garnering last - minute IOC voter support .
3 - Anybody who still thinks the Olympics are only about sports …has not been paying attention .
Hosting the Olympics is extremely prestigious and DOES have an impact on a country ’s standing in the world and foreign affairs .
For one thing …it could help a country that has lost some “ good will ” in the eyes of the international community ( hint hint ) gain some of it back .
4 - If done properly … it can generate a TON of revenue .
China , was a bad example … they built huge , expensive , temporary structures , and as a result cut into profits .
Athens , also a bad example … had huge cost overruns , most notably to overhaul their subway system , roads , trains , and other infrastructure .
Atlanta did a much much better job … in fact , they even had the wisdom AFTER the Olympics to repurpose the Olympic housing as dorms for the Georgia Institute of Technology and Georgia State University .
As it stands , Chicago already has strong infrastructure , an huge international airport , and plenty of stadiums and venues ALREADY BUILT .
BEST CASE : The Chicago 2016 group estimates that $ 22.5 billion dollars could be generated .
MIDDLE OF THE ROAD :
Other experts suggest that the $ 3.8 billion ( with a $ 500 million “ buffer ” ) will likely not be enough … but that the likely benefits STILL outweigh the risks .
WORST CASE : A study by the Anderson Economic Group says the Chicago 2016 projections that the Olympics would generate the equivalent of 12 Super Bowls , and that the increased tourism would net the equivalent of 70 Super Bowls …are too optimistic .
The group sites that potential cost overruns and smaller revenues could put the Chicago taxpayers at risk … but that the long - term benefits are still substantial .
5 - Regardless of how much the Olympics cost , or produced in revenues … one thing is for sure : it would create JOBS .
Yes JOBS , glorious JOBS .
This point is certainly not lost on Mayor Daley , who says that the new jobs should be seen as the true benefit of hosting the games .
Estimates say that 315,000 new jobs would be created , 172,000 of them in Chicago … and those jobs would generate new income equaling $ 11.2 BILLION .
6 - Lastly , contrary to commentators on Fox and Michael Steele , who rather naively seem to think that jobs for the 2016 Olympics would n’t be created until 2016 … many jobs would be immediately created , with more jobs created each year leading up to 2016 .
File this little fact under “ D ” for “ Duh . ”
But as always , the people attempting to create controversy and outrage … have little use for these obvious facts , studies , and elements of common sense .
The outrage itself is a yet another blind , unreasoning response to a president that these people simply despise .
To think that these critics really care about Obama supposedly “ shortchanging ” other issues and crises …is to be misled .
The Olympics is a wonderful , inspiring , national pride - generating event … and the real reason the right - wing protests , is that they ca n’t bear the thought of Barack Obama bringing it home .
AUSTRALIA'S population will increase by more than half to 35 million by the middle of the century , outstripping by 7 million official estimates released only two years ago .
The proportion of those aged over 65 will be lower than that estimated two years ago in the last intergenerational report released by the Howard government , but will still be a lot higher than it is today .
The Treasurer , Wayne Swan , will unveil the revised estimates in a speech today stressing the need to prepare the economy for a growing and increasingly ageing population , including policies that will require older people to keep contributing .
He will also launch the University of NSW 's Longevity Index , which will be updated and published every quarter , enabling people to continually adjust their calculations of how much money they need to retire .
It will be the first Australian measure to track changes in the expected lifetime of the population as a whole and of different age and gender groups .
United States Has Caught the Japanese Economic Disease , Who Will buy Our Debt ?
I first wrote about the Muddle Through Economy in 2002 , and the term has more or less become a theme we have returned to from time to time .
In 2007 I wrote that we would indeed get back to a Muddle Through Economy after the end of the coming recession .
If you Google the term , at least for the first four pages more than half the references are to this e-letter .
I get a lot of flak from both bulls and bears about being either too optimistic or too pessimistic .
Being in the muddle through middle is comfortable to me .
Last week I expressed my concern that we as a country are taking actions that could indeed " Kill the Goose " of our free - market economy .
I rightly got letters asking me how I could maintain Muddle Through in the face of that letter .
I have given it a lot of thought and research .
How likely are we to muddle through in the face of $ 1.5 trillion and larger deficits ?
Today we take another look at Muddle Through .
It should be interesting .
But first , two housekeeping items .
I want to welcome the 150,000 members of the National Association of the Self - Employed to this letter .
They have asked me to be a special consulting economist to their group , and they will send this letter each week to their members .
Since its beginning in 1981 , the National Association for the Self - Employed has pioneered support for micro-businesses and the self - employed , and been a forceful advocate for small business in this country .
( www.nase.org) I am honored .
I am pleased to add you to my 1 million closest friends .
I hope you find it useful .
Second , I will be going to South America at the end of next week , to Buenos Aires , Montevideo , Sao Paulo and Rio .
I will be speaking in those cities and traveling with my new Latin American partner , Enrique Fynn of Fynn Capital ( based in Uruguay ) .
If you would like to find out about this tour or what services he can help you with , you can go to www.accreditedinvestor.ws and sign up and Enrique will get in touch with you .
And as always , if you are an accredited investor , you can go to that website and one of my partners in the world will get back to you .
( In this regard , I am president of and a registered representative of Millennium Wave Securities , LLC , member FINRA . )
And now to the letter .
Muddle Through , R.I.P.?
I defined a Muddle Through Economy in the past as one of slow growth ( in the area of 1 - 2 % ) and a slack employment environment , such as we had in 2002 and the early part of 2003 .
In early 2007 , I suggested we would return at some point to such an environment at the end of the recession I was predicting .
I am not surprised about the response of the Fed to the current recession and credit crisis , whether it's the large monetization of debt or the low interest rates .
Assuming they more or less remove the monetary easing in a reasonable manner , there is nothing that would make me think we do not eventually recover , albeit at a very slow Muddle Through pace , with a jobless recovery that lasts for several years .
It will not be pleasant , but we 'll survive .
However , gentle reader , never in my wildest dreams did I think we could be looking at government deficits of $ 1.5 trillion dollars and actually budgeting future deficits of over $ 1 trillion as far as the eye can see .
And there is real reason to think that under current plans , $ 1 trillion deficits are optimistic .
Look at the graph above from the Heritage Foundation .
They suggest that current policy would bring us closer to a $ 2 trillion deficit by 2019 .
And that assumes nominal growth that is north of 3 % and unemployment dropping back below 5 % in reasonably short order .
If you make less optimistic assumptions , the number can become much larger rather quickly .
Where do we find that much money to finance that large a deficit ?
We will look at what might be the answer , but first we need to look at a basic concept in economics .
Savings Equal Investments
GDP ( Gross Domestic Product ) is defined as Consumption ( C ) plus Investment ( I ) plus Government Spending ( G ) plus [ Exports ( E ) minus Imports ( I ) ] or :
GDP = C + I + G + ( E - I )
( For the wonks out there , GDP is usually termed " Y " . )
You can calculate national savings as GDP minus consumption and government spending .
That means that investment equals savings plus net exports .
If there are no net exports , then money must come back into the US from outside the country to finance investments , along with savings .
This equation is known as an identity .
An identity is an equality that remains true regardless of the values of any variables that appear within it .
That means it is not a guess or an approximation .
It is simple reality .
Thus , if there is a government deficit , there must be savings by both consumers and businesses , plus capital flows from outside the country , to offset that deficit in order for there to be any money left over for investments .
In the short run , an increase in government spending can offset a decline in consumption ( a recession ) , but absent savings a government deficit crowds out investment in the long run .
There must be savings in order for there to be investment .
And without investment , you do not get job growth or economic growth .
Japanese Disease
Some readers wrote this week telling me I am far too worried about a rising government deficit .
Right now we are at roughly 42 % of debt to GDP .
In 1989 , at the start of the lost decades , Japan had a debt - to - GDP ratio of 51 % .
Now it is at 178 % , and the world has not come to an end for them .
In fact , they are running massive government deficits today and plan to do so for a long time .
Why , I am asked , ca n't we be like Japan ?
And my answer is that it is possible , but the cost that Japan has paid has been high .
In 1989 , private Japanese debt ( businesses and consumers ) was at a debt - to - GDP ratio of 212 % .
Now it is at 110 % .
And the total of both government and private debt is roughly the same ( within 5 % ) of where it was 20 years ago .
Along with running large trade surpluses , private debt has been exchanged for government debt .
Savings have fallen from the mid-teens to about 2 % today , as the country is rapidly aging and now using its savings to live on .
And how much has all that government spending helped the country ?
Before I answer that , read these paragraphs from Hoisington Asset Management 's latest letter ( last week 's Outside the Box ) :
" The federal government 's promise to extricate the U.S. economy from this recession involves more spending ( increasing public debt ) and more subsidies for consumers , such as car rebates and home buying incentives ( more private debt ) .
In other words , more debt is supposed to solve the problem of over - indebtedness .
The truth is that this policy merely indentures its citizens further without providing any income for repayment of debt .
In previous letters we have discussed the fact that the government spending multiplier is zero ( read Professor Robert Barro 's book , Macroeconomics - a Modern Approach , p. 370 ) .
" This means there is no long term income benefit from stimulus programs .
According to the latest academic research , the most recent $ 800 billion stimulus plan will boost economic activity in the short run , but will surely depress economic activity over time .
The government problem is complicated by the fact that the tax multiplier is 3 , meaning that a 1 % change in taxes will change GDP by about 3 % over time .
More recent research ( Barro & Redlick , September 2009 , " NBER Working Paper 15369 " ) suggests that a 1 % cut in the marginal tax rate would raise GDP in the ensuing year by 0.6 % .
With the deficit rising due to a zero spending multiplier , the tendency will be to try to raise taxes to pay for this higher level of expenditures , which will further depress aggregate spending and output . "
For all intents and purposes , Japan has had no growth for almost two decades .
Their nominal GDP is where it was 17 years ago , and the number of employed people is at 20 - years - ago levels .
An aging population has masked their unemployment problems , as older citizens retire .
Their savings went to government debt .
Taxes were raised numerous times .
Since government deficit spending has no long - term multiplier effect , growth has been nonexistent .
( By the way , that research about multiplier effects has also been done by Christina Romer , the chairman of the current President 's Council of Economic Advisors , and further explored by European economists .
There is general agreement on these facts . )
In 1998 , the US had a total debt - ( government plus private ) to - GDP ratio of 260 % .
Today it is 373 % .
We have added over $ 15 trillion in debt , yet total employment today is roughly where it was 9 years ago .
But the current economic leadership wants to solve the problem of too much debt with even more debt .
I am sympathetic with the idea that in the short run the government should step in and the Fed should print ( within limits ) money to keep us from deflation .
But the equation we spent time on earlier suggests that if we continue to run massive deficits , we run the risk of catching Japanese disease - a decade - long ( or longer ) period of slow growth and high unemployment , especially since our population is growing and our Boomers are going back to work ( and surveys suggest they intend to work longer ) .
Large government deficits choke off the very investment that we need to create jobs .
In the name of doing good , the unintended consequence is to make it more difficult for small businesses to start up and create jobs .
And we all know that small business is the engine for job creation .
The way out of the current morass is to create jobs and increase productivity .
But if the government runs deficits of $ 1.5 trillion , that means whatever savings ( corporate and consumer ) we have will not go into the investments we need , but into government debt .
Who Will Buy the Debt ?
Now , let 's go back to the problem of who will buy the debt .
How can we find $ 1.5 trillion each and every year ?
Some of it will come from foreign central banks , as we continue to run a trade deficit .
Once those dollars leave our shores , they do not disappear .
They can only go back into a dollar - denominated investment .
Up to now , that has typically been US government debt .
If China decides to use its dollars to buy commodities or other assets , whoever sells them the assets now has the dollars and must decide what to do with them .
So give or take a few billion , about $ 400 billion will come back to the US from our trade deficit next year .
That still leaves $ 1.1 trillion .
Upon reflection , and cutting to the chase , I think that the buyers of the debt could be US banks for quite some time .
The next graph shows commercial and industrial loans at US banks falling precipitously .
Banks have ( correctly ) tightened lending standards , but that means that small and medium - sized businesses , which account for over 85 % of all jobs , have been cut off from the life blood of growth .
Is it any wonder they are cutting jobs at a prodigious rate ?
The next graph shows bank credit ( of all types ) , going back to 1974 .
Notice that even during recessions ( gray shaded areas ) bank lending either grows or at the most goes flat .
But now we are experiencing something new : bank lending is falling .
Notice the sharp increase in lending in 2008 as corporations decided to draw down their banks ' lines of credit , afraid that the banks might cut back .
And with good reason , as banks did exactly that .
So where do banks put their cash and reserves they are not lending ?
At the Fed and in Treasury debt .
If you can leverage capital at ten to one ( as banks can ) and if you get 2 % ( for longer - term debt ) and if you only have costs of , say , 50 basis points ( or 0.5 % ) , you can make a return on equity of 15 % with no risk .
And that is what we are seeing .
Banks are taking the money the Fed is printing and the government is giving them and putting it back at the Fed .
Bank reserves at the Fed are exploding .
And they are likely to continue to do so , since bank balance sheets are still deteriorating , especially at smaller and regional banks exposed to commercial real estate loans .
Banks own 45 % of commercial real estate loans , compared to only 21 % of single - family loans .
Banks ( in general ) are going to have to raise capital and reduce their loan portfolios in order to keep within the guidelines for adequate reserve capital .
Small wonder that my friend Chris Whalen ( one of the real experts on banks ) thinks we will see over 400 banks fail in this cycle .
One quick chart to further highlight the problem that banks are facing .
I have been writing for several years that commercial real estate loans will be the next shoe to drop .
Moody 's calculates that commercial real estate prices have dropped 30 % .
Over a trillion dollars in commercial real estate loans are coming due in the next few years .
Banks are going to continue to reduce their loan portfolios in order to deal with the massive write - offs they are going to have to make .
And my bet is they put those reserves they are not lending into government debt .
Given that the current Congress is hell bent on massively raising taxes in 2011 , we are likely to dip back into recession by then , if not before .
Remember , taxes have a multiplier effect of three .
That means tax cuts increase GDP ( over time ) by three times their amount .
But tax increases reduce GDP by three times the increase .
That will make deficits worse , and unemployment will again start to rise from already high levels .
Twenty states have already raised sales taxes , and more are raising other taxes .
It is a vicious spiral .
The New Muddle Through Economy
This is not a prescription for a return to normal growth .
We are headed for a New Normal that is less than what the market currently believes .
Unless the deficit comes under control at some point , we face the real prospect of catching Japanese Disease and suffering yet another lost decade .
Can we Muddle Through ?
We have no choice but to do so .
But it will not be fun .
It will not be long - term 2 % growth and employment going back to 6 % any time soon .
Can we reverse the course ?
With a different attitude and leadership in Congress , maybe we can .
But it wo n't happen next year , and it 's unlikely in 2011 .
I am afraid we will have to put my old friend Muddle Through , as I previously defined him , back in his box for a while .
But wait , if my friend at PIMCO , Mohammed El - Erian , can tell us we are going to a " New Normal , " then I can decide that we are going to a " New Muddle Through Economy . "
Just not one as benign as I used to think .
In the end , that is what we will do .
We will figure out how to deal with the environment in which we find ourselves .
That is what free markets and entrepreneurs do .
Things will sort out , but not before we have what could be an even more difficult crisis , which will force us to make hard choices .
As an aside , I am not expecting that we will see the crisis I am thinking of any time soon .
We can move along with positive GDP for some time .
I am thinking of the longer term , 1 - 3 years out .
We will become complacent .
I will get letters telling me I am too pessimistic .
Just as I did in late 2006 when I said we would be in a recession by late 2007 .
But I firmly believe we will see a double - dip recession within another 18 months ( at the most ) .
Stock markets drop on average about 40 % in a recession .
Adjust your portfolios accordingly .
On the Road Again
I am writing tonight from Detroit .
Tomorrow I will be in New York watching the Yankees / LA game .
I will be the guy in the second row behind home plate in the Dallas Cowboys jacket .
I will be on Yahoo Tech Ticker on Monday morning , so you should be able to go to Yahoo and see me later that afternoon .
Then Philadelphia on Tuesday , speaking at my partner Steve Blumenthal 's CMG conference for investment advisors .
They have a very interesting platform of trading advisors .
You can see them at http://cmgfunds.net/public/mauldin_questionnaire.asp
I had a great deal of fun at the New Orleans conference , being with old friends and meeting new ones .
David Tice ( of the Prudent Bear Fund ) was an exceptional host for dinner at Emeril's .
I was surprised that Karl Rove actually remembered me after nine years .
I thoroughly enjoyed spending some quality time with my friend Ron Paul .
We share a lot of concerns about the future of the Republic .
I was pleasantly surprised by how thoughtful Howard Dean was .
And very personable .
I go to Houston on Wednesday , Orlando on Thursday , and then South America on Saturday .
I will be doing a lot of writing from hotel rooms , but all in all it will be fun .
You have a great week , and remember that in 10 years none of us will look back and want to return to 2009 .
2019 will be better than we can possibly imagine .
We just have to make sure we all get there !
Time to hit the send button and find an adult beverage .
All the best ,

21 Oct 09 , 10:45 Mauldin , are you high ?
Your pathetic episodes of telling us where you are and name - dropping of criminals like Rove and David Tice is DISGUSTING .
You suck up so much to the media and others who stand against main street .
Hey there , time traveller !
This article was published 2/11/2009 ( 3985 days ago ) , so information in it may no longer be current .
Playing soccer underneath the arena stands prior to a game has become a standard pre-game ritual for most professional hockey teams .
And it ’s one that has thrown two teams -- the AHL ’s Manitoba Moose and the NHL ’s Vancouver Canucks -- into a bit of an upheaval this morning .
Canucks forward Michael Grabner , who ’s been in exceptional in Vancouver since getting called up from the Moose last month , severely injured his ankle Sunday night while playing soccer with Canucks teammates prior to Vancouver ’s game against the Colorado Avalanche .
An MRI or x-ray is expected to be conducted today , but it is feared Grabner may have broken the ankle and could be out at least a month .
Virtually every pro hockey team has at least a few players these days who kick a soccer ball around prior to games in an exercise that ’s believed to enhance coordination , serve as a good physical warm - up and work at team - building .
Not surprisingly , the practice is particularly popular among European hockey players .
Grabner , who was leading the Moose in scoring when he was called up , is Austrian .
It ’s a devastating blow to Grabner , who ’d been making the most of his first ever NHL stint .
Grabner had two goals and three assists in nine games prior to the injury .
And it ’s also thrown both the Moose and Canucks -- two clubs already decimated by injury -- into further disarray .
With Grabner now out indefinitely , the Canucks announced this morning that they have signed Moose forward Matt Pettinger , who ’s already on a plane to Vancouver this morning .
The loss of Pettinger is a big blow to the Moose , who have struggled offensively lately -- netting just six non -shootout goals in their last six games .
Pettinger , who played with Tampa Bay last season after a brief stint with the Moose , was one of the lone offensive bright spots for the Moose and the loss of him and forward Guillaume Desbiens -- who injured his foot in a game last Friday and is out for tonight ’s game at MTS Centre against the Norfolk Admirals -- had Moose head coach Scott Arniel shaking his head at the pre-game skate this morning .
At one point last week , Arniel had nine regulars out of the Moose lineup and he was hopeful that his club -- with five games scheduled in the next six nights -- was finally going to get back to some normalcy this week .
Instead , Arniel starts a new work week having lost two reliable forwards on a team that was already struggling to put the puck in the net and does n’t have any time right now to put in place much of a Plan B .
" This started at about 12:35 last night when I got a call , " Arniel said .
" My head started shaking about that time at night and I did n’t sleep very well .
And then I came here this morning and found out Dezzie ( Desbiens ) was n’t doing so well .
It ’s just been a wacky first 14 or 15 games of the year .
What we ’ve been doing is just keeping our head above water and we ’ll have to continue to do that ....
" A little bit of smoke and mirrors , but we ’ll try and get her done . "
With Pettinger up , Desbiens out and forward Matt Pope and defenceman Lawrence Nycholat still nursing injuries , the Moose re-signed Olivier Latendresse this morning .
Latendresse , a 23 - year - old left - winger from La Salle , Quebec , played the first game of the season with the Moose and has been playing in the East Coast Hockey League ever since , where he ’s been leading Victoria in scoring .
" He ’s a small dynamic guy who can really move out there , " Arniel said .
" He ’s not big - bodied but he can play in traffic . "
All the injury havoc is forcing the Moose and Canucks to accelerate their search for an offensive - minded veteran player for the AHL club .
" They ’ve been trying to swing a deal , " said Arniel , " and we ’ve been trying to turn over every stone possible ... There ’s just not a lot of players available right now . "
Asked what his ideal veteran would look like , Arniel was blunt .
" I ’ll take anything -- anything with two legs and can handle a stick right now . "
Moose captain Mike Keane acknowledged the current adversity , but said there ’s no point in complaining .
" At this level , you ca n’t have a ‘ woe is me ’ attitude , " Keane said this morning , " or you ’re going to find yourself at the bottom of the heap . "
Guerrilla signs : 15 funny road and rail notices
Whether we use cars or public transport to get around , we are all bombarded with signs telling us what we must and must not do .
Some people have decided to fight back .
You may recall that Judge Land ( the Bush appointee ) had previously dismissed the Complaint filed by Connie Rhodes , a flight surgeon who was questioning her orders to be deployed to Iraq .
He found the filing frivolous and warned her counsel , Orly Taitz , not to darken his doorstep again .
Naturally , Orly turned around and filed an emergency motion to stay deployment ( in which Orly , amongst other things , accused the judge of treason ) .
Judge Land , none too happy , issued a show cause order two weeks ago , giving Taitz two weeks to show cause why he should not impose a fine of $ 10,000 for her conduct .
Bearing down on the close of business , Orly filed a Motion to Recuse Judge Land .
It is truly one of the most amazing things I have ever seen filed by an attorney , anywhere , in my 27 years of practice .
It is vintage Orly , in that it contains a myriad of wacky legal theories , such as a judge has no power to impose Rule 11 sanctions .
She takes particular umbrage at Land 's having referred to her as a de facto leader of the birther movement , stating that he in essence called her " batshit crazy " .
( Yes , that 's really in there ) .
Orly also complains mightily that Judge Land issued his decisions with great speed , accusing him of never having read the lawsuit .
I guess she thought she was being clever when she used the term " blitzkrieg speed " , implying that he was a Nazi brownshirt without really saying it .
Orly also accuses Judge Land of having ex parte contact with Eric Holder , ( who of course threatened and unduly influenced the Judge to rule against her ) but her promised affidavit to support that claim seems not to have materialized ( surprise , surprise ) .
My summary cannot really do the pleading justice .
Those of you who are interested can read it here
Orly also filed a motion to extend time ( basically a motion for continuance to tell him why he should not fine her ) which can be read here
UPDATE : It appears that a good part of Orly 's Motion to Recuse Judge Land was cut and pasted from a Motion to Recuse that Orly filed in Judge Lazzara 's federal court in Florida .

Former President George W. Bush is now on the lecture circuit as a motivational speaker — and he has a message for America ’s unemployed :
The marketplace is “ fair . ”
Speaking in Forth Worth , Texas in his debut as a motivational speaker , Bush ’s speech echoed some of his themes as president .
But his comments on the economy are sure to rankle the millions of Americans who ’ve been laid off .

“ The marketplace works , ” Bush remarked .
“ It is fair .
It is equitable .
It is a fair form of democracy . ”
Bush addressed a crowd of 11,000 who paid for a verbal injection of enthusiasm from the former president .
“ Every single day I was honored to be your president by bringing honor and dignity to the office , ” a local newspaper quoted Bush as saying during the day - long “ Get Motivated ” seminar .
His message to those whose decisions have made them unpopular ?
“ It ’s so simple in life to chase popularity , but popularity is fleeting , ” Bush quipped .
“ It ’s not real . ”

Bush also sought to mollify critics who ’ve argued that politics played too much of a role in his decisionmaking in going to war , saying he ’d never sell out “ their loved ones for the sake of pure politics . ”
“ And let me tell you , ” he added .
“ I never did . ”
Also in the crowd was Bush ’s first Secretary of State , Colin Powell , who praised the president ’s legacy , positing that Bush had kept America safe after 9/11 .
ADVERTISEMENT
Bush also highlighted his faith in God as contributing to the success of his presidency .
“ I do n’t see how you can be president without relying on the Almighty , ” the ex-president declared .
“ Now when I was 21 , I would n’t have told you that , but at age 63 , I can tell you that one of the most amazing surprises of the presidency was the fact that people ’s prayers affected me .
I ca n’t prove it to you .
But I can tell you some days were great , some days not so great .
But every day was joyous . ”

The Washington Post , who had a reporter at the event , said Bush looked “ younger than his 63 years and relaxed . ”
“ Many people interviewed afterward said they liked Bush , perhaps even because he was n’t the best speaker of the day , ” the Post reported added .
“ He could have said a thesaurus was a big scaly creature that roamed the planet millions of years ago and they would have applauded . ”

In previous posts , Boson was introduced as a command framework , usable from the commandline and irb .
In this post , we ’ll focus on how Boson enhances irb by treating methods like shell commands .
Preface
If you ’re an avid irb user like me , your ~/.irbrc is littered with methods .
These methods are sometimes favorite tweaks to Ruby ’s core libraries and sometimes interfaces to gems .
But regardless of what they represent , when you use them they ’re just like shell commands .
With this user in mind , Boson aims to give methods command - like functionality .
This means giving a method the ability to have simple yet powerful options .
This means aliasing and annotating methods are commonplace .
This means searching and sharing your commands with others are easy to do .
And if you want , you can even give a method instant views .
Here ’s the order we ’ll be covering using Boson with irb :
To use Boson in irb , drop this in your ~/.irbrc .
For any other ruby console application the setup is the same :
require ' boson ' Boson .
start
Boson.start comes with some options .
If you do n’t like that Boson tells you every library it loads , set :verbose= > false .
When Boson starts , it loads libraries of commands .
Boson libraries are just Ruby modules and Boson commands are just methods in those modules .
Most libraries are in their own file under ~/.boson / commands .
Each library can have an optional namespace defined in a config file .
With this organization commands are independent of Boson .
There are no namespace dsl methods as with Rake and no required Thor subclassing as with Thor .
This is on purpose .
Boson strives to allow all of its functionality to be written in plain ruby .
This way you are free to easily test your commands and use them with other applications independent of Boson .
Also , if you decided to stop using Boson , all libraries you ’ve built for it can still be used in irb without modifying them .
To do this you would simply extend your library ’s modules into Ruby ’s top - level object main .
Boson comes with a handful of core commands but let ’s focus on three you ’ll probably use the most : commands , libraries and load_library .
Since these commands have options , you should familiarize yourself with the default global options they have .
Also , you should be aware that option values can be aliased .
This command searches your commands in a myriad of ways .
# With no arguments commands ( ) lists all loaded commands >> commands

Since commands ( ) comes with Boson ’s global rendering options , commands can be sorted by command attribute and have only certain attributes displayed .
# Before sorting and selecting command attributes , we need to know what attributes we can choose from in our options .

This command loads a library and its commands .
This allows you to load the bare minimum functionality you need in irb and then load commands as needed .
# Verify the desired ri command does n't exist yet >> ri ' method_mis ' NameError : undefined local variable or method `ri ' for main :

To make your life even easier , you can put Boson in a mode where unloaded commands are automatically loaded once they ’re executed .
How does this work ?
Since commands are just methods on main , Boson redefines main ’s method_missing …
# To enable this you need to modify your ~/.irbrc : # Boson.start :autoload_libraries => true #
Assuming irb does n't have the ri command again >> ri ' method_mes ' Loaded library ' ri ' +--------+------------------------------------+

Up to now , Boson libraries have been described as a module sitting in a file .
While this type of library , a Boson : : FileLibrary is the most common and functionally - rich , there are other library types .
Boson :: GemLibrary makes commands from a gem .
Let ’s see this library in action by loading the sketches gem :
# Without any configuration , let 's load sketches as a library >> load_library ' sketches ' Loaded library sketches => true #
Let 's see what commands Boson picked up >> commands ' l : sket ' # or commands ' lib : sket ' +-------------+----------+-------+-------+-------------+ | full_name | lib | alias | usage | description |
+-------------+----------+-------+-------+-------------+
| sketch_from | sketches | | | | | name_sketch | sketches | | | | | save_sketch | sketches | | | | | sketches | sketches | | | | | sketch | sketches | | | | +-------------+----------+-------+-------+-------------+
5 rows in set # Begin sketching >> sketch # ...
Is sketches already built to work with Boson ?
Not quite .
Rather , this demonstrates how Boson safeguards main by tracking what gems dump in Object and Kernel .
Unfortunately this is all too common with irb-related gems .
Now let ’s use a gem that does n’t dump methods on us :
# Create commands put and delete from HTTParty 's API .
# Values of : class_commands hash can point to any ruby code ending with a method call . >> load_library ' httparty ' , :class_commands=>{' put '=>' HTTParty.put ' , ' delete '= >' HTTParty.delete ' } => true >> commands ' l : http ' # or commands ' lib: http ' +-----------+----------+-------+-------+-------------+ | full_name | lib | alias | usage | description |
+-----------+----------+-------+-------+-------------+ | blank ?
| httparty | | | | | dclone | httparty | | | | | delete | httparty | | | | | put | httparty | | | | +-----------+----------+-------+-------+-------------+
4 rows in set => true #
Well , we spoke to soon .
blank ?
and dclone are again monkeypatched methods .
#
If you 'd rather have Boson not detect these methods for you : # load_library ' httparty ' , :object_methods= > false , :class_commands ... #
To avoid typing out configurations for each gem you use , save them in the config file # ~/.boson/config/boson.yml under the : libraries key : # # :libraries : # httparty : # : class_commands : # put : HTTParty .put # delete : HTTParty .delete #
Next irb session we can just load httparty and use our preconfigured commands bash > irb >> load_library ' httparty ' => true >> put ' http://blah/blah' # ...
Boson :: RequireLibrary makes its commands centered around any require - able library ( i.e. standard libraries and rip packages ) :
# Let 's make a command from the standard library abbrev >> load_library ' abbrev ' , :class_commands=>{' abbrev'=>' Abbrev.abbrev'} , :command_aliases= >{' abbrev'= >' ab'} => true # abbrev ( ) shows a hash of all unique strings that abbreviate an array >> abbrev % w{awesome audacious asinine} => { " audacious " =>" audacious " , " asini " = > " asinine " , " aw " = > " awesome " , " asi " = > " asinine " , " awesome " = > " awesome " , " awe " = > " awesome " , " aweso " = > " awesome " , " asin " = > " asinine " , " aud " => " audacious " , " audaci " = > " audacious " , " asinin " = > " asinine " , " audacio " = > " audacious " , " awesom " = >" awesome " , " as " =>" asinine " , " audac " = >" audacious " , " audaciou " = > " audacious " , " awes " = >" awesome " , " asinine " = > " asinine " , " au " = > " audacious " , " auda " =>" audacious " } # Even though we have n't hooked up abbrev( ) to Boson / Hirb rendering # we can still use it with the default command render >> render ab ( %w{awesome audacious asinine} ) .sort +-----------+-----------+ | 0 | 1 | +-----------+-----------+ | as | asinine | | asi | asinine | | asin | asinine | | asini | asinine | | asinin | asinine | | asinine | asinine | # ... #
Let 's make irb feel more like a shell with fileutils >> load_library ' fileutils ' , :class_commands=>% w{cd cp ln mv chmod}.inject ( {} ) { |h , e| h[e ] = " FileUtils.#{e} " ; h} => true #
Let 's see what commands we have now >> commands ' l : fileu ' # or commands ' lib : fileu ' +-----------+-----------+-------+-------+-------------+ | full_name | lib | alias | usage | description |

5 rows in set => true
Boson :: ModuleLibrary simply makes commands from a module ’s class methods :
>> load_library Math , : commands = >% w{sin cos tan} => true >> commands 'l : math ' # or commands ' lib : math ' +-----------+------+-------+-------+-------------+ | full_name | lib | alias | usage | description |

Before migrating your methods or irb commands , remember Boson ’s philosophy .
Whatever time you spend organizing your irbrc is n’t in vain .
You can always take what you ’ve made and use it without Boson .
The easiest way to migrate is to simply wrap all your irbrc methods in a module and explicitly pass that module to Boson .
start :
# in ~/.irbrc module Easy def command1 end # ... end require ' boson ' Boson .
start : libraries =>[
Easy ]
The downside to this is that your commands do n’t have options or views
If you want those features and still want the simplest thing possible , put all your methods in a module and drop that module into a file under ~/.boson / commands / .
If you ’re serious about organizing your irbrc , you should break your methods up into libraries .
If any of your methods are simply wrappers around a gem or a require - able library , consider making a gem library or a require library .
Otherwise make each library by wrapping it in a module and placing it in under ~/.boson / commands / .
Next you should consider adding aliases and descriptions to your commands .
Command aliasing is explained here .
To add a command description , simply add a comment directly above it .
If your description spans multiple lines than use the desc method attribute :
#@desc
My description spans multiple lines # because I have a lot to say and # not enough space to say it def talk # ... end
Lastly , you should decide which libraries to load at startup .
The default is to load all libraries .
You ’ll probably want to change that once your libraries load multiple gems .
To specify these libraries , open up Boson ’s main config file at ~/.boson/config/boson.yml .
Add a : console_defaults key and give it an array of libraries .
See my config file as an example .
Postface
In this post , we ’ve seen how Boson treats methods like shell commands .
In doing so , it makes irb ( or any ruby console ) a simple yet powerful method - based shell .
For more traditional ruby shell implementations , see rubish , rush and pope .

We 've been impressed with the speed increases that rooting and moving apps to SD cards can bring to sometimes sluggish Android phones .
If you 're not about to crack your phone 's firmware , the AndroidGuys blog suggests a few optimization tips .

For one thing , they suggest grabbing a decent task - killing program to knock down the background processes you leave running when you quickly open and close applications .
TasKiller Free and Advanced Task Killer both do a decent job .
From personal experience , I find TasKiller 's widgets , either as a single - icon , kill - all function or a horizontal " Task Bar , " to be helpful enough to keep on a side screen for quick access .

Then again , another of AndroidGuys ' recommendations is to keep your home screen as uncluttered as possible , as your phone has to re-draw icons , picture frames , and re-update widgets from multiple streams every time you dash back home .
Finding a good , discretionary balance between helpfulness and speed will be a personal matter , but we can vouch for the helpfulness of skipping , for example , the music player widget .
More tips and suggestions , including basic settings changes , are offered at the full post .

Newbtorial : How to Keep the Zip in Your Android [ AndroidGuys ]
CTIA Conference , San Diego -- AT&T Wireless CEO
Ralph de la Vega bemoaned the disproportionate wireless bandwidth usage of a small number of its smartphone customers [ read iPhone users ] in a speech to wireless industry professionals here today , and hinted at an unpleasant way of dealing with the problem .
De la Vega spent his first 11 slides talking about the virtues of the U.S. wireless industry versus the rest of the world , and of the quality and popularity of AT&T ’s 3G wireless network and services in particular .
He said such a vibrant market needed no additional regulation from the FCC .
De la Vega talked about the enormous growth in demand for wireless broadband service in the US , and about the immediate need to free up more wireless spectrum to accommodate that growth .
But spectrum is hard to come by these days , and , as De la Vega pointed out , even if new chunks of spectrum could be reallocated quickly , it still takes a few years to build the networks that use that spectrum .
Meanwhile demand for mobile broadband rockets upward among wireless users .
De la Vega cited research showing that demand for wireless broadband has grown 5,000 times in the last three years .
That growth as roundly expected to accelerate in the coming years .
But all that data usage is not evenly spread across AT&T 's wireless customer base , De la Vega says -- far from it .
He cited AT&T research showing that just 3 percent of AT&T 's smartphone customers [ read iPhone users ] use 40 percent of all smartphone data , that they consume 13 times the data of " the average smartphone customer , " yet represent less than 1 percent of AT&T ’s total postpaid customer base .
Big problem — but AT&T management should have seen this coming a year ago .
Or maybe they did , but getting Wall Street to buy into the idea of aggressive and costly network upgrades is like pulling teeth without anesthetic — lots of screaming .
So in the absence of new spectrum and new , faster 4G networks , what does AT&T intend to do about the growing demand in the near term ?
De la Vega ’s comments on this subject really caught my attention .
Without the proper management of these networks ,
De la Vega said , regular data users will be “ crowded out ” by the small number of users [ read iPhone users ] who use massive amounts of data .
“ We have to manage the network to make sure that the few cannot crowd out the many , ” De la Vega continued .
He said the words “ crowded out ” at least five times in that part of his keynote address .
But what exactly does
De la Vega mean by “ proper management ” ?
That kind of talk reminds me of Comcast ’s much - maligned strategy of throttling down the bandwidth allowance of users who routinely download large torrent files .
In the face of exploding data service demand and scarce wireless spectrum , does AT&T intend to quietly begin rationing the data usage of bandwidth hogs like the iPhone ?
Will AT&T begin to quietly “ manage ” the duration and speed of my 3G connection based on how much data I ’ve used in a given day , or on the type of content or services I ’m using the bandwidth to access ?
Of course nobody outside AT&T knows exactly what the company has in mind .
But if De la Vega 's numbers are correct , AT&T will be forced to do something , and I got the impression that De la Vega was casually introducing the " rationing " concept to the wireless community today .
AT&T 's exclusive deal with Apple to sell the iPhone has made it a top - shelf wireless provider , but that blessing could become a curse if the AT&T 3G network can't keep up with the large bandwidth appetite of the popular device .

There 's quite a bit of fuss being made of the 40th anniversary of " Monty Python 's Flying Circus , " and rightfully so .
Let us not forget , however , that all six members of Python have also continued to work outside of their primary organization throughout those four decades , and their solo efforts have brought us a great deal of exemplary entertainment , both comedic and dramatic .
To be fair , some are brilliant , while others are decidedly less so , but when you 've got Graham Chapman , John Cleese , Terry Gilliam , Eric Idle , Terry Jones , or Michael Palin appearing somewhere within your film or television program , it instantly becomes worth a look for any Python fan .
In compiling 40 notable solo projects from the Pythons over the course of 40 years , we established two cardinal ground rules .
First , we only included the Terry Gilliam directorial efforts which featured other Python members within their casts , and second , we opted out of using any voiceover work .
Fortunately , as you will soon see , there was plenty of live - action work to choose from …and with that said , let us borrow a line associated with the first project list and say , " If you want it , here it is : come and get it . "
40 .
The Magic Christian ( 1969 ) – Even though it 's based on a novel by an American ( Terry Southern ) , the reasons for Anglophiles to watch this film are plentiful .
The film stars Peter Sellers as Sir Guy Grand , the richest man in the world , who adopts a young man named , uh , Youngman ( Ringo Starr ) , and sets about showing him that everyone can be bought .
" The Magic Christian " boasted a highly memorable theme song ( thank you , Paul McCartney and Badfinger ) , but for our purposes , the most important fact is that the screenplay was adapted by Messrs .
Chapman and Cleese , both of whom appear fleetingly within the film , along with Python precursor ( and Sellers ' fellow Goon ) Spike Milligan , Christopher Lee , and …Roman Polanski ?
True enough : Polanski is listed in the credits as " Solitary Drinker . "
Well , to be fair , the man 's got a lot to drink about .
39 .
The Rise and Rise of Michael Rimmer ( 1970 ) – As with " The Magic Christian , " Chapman and Cleese both assist in the writing of this film and make ephemeral appearances ( as characters named Pumer and Fromage , respectively ) .
The real star here , however , is Peter Cook , who plays Michael Rimmer , a semi- sociopath who lies , manipulates , and even murders his way through the world in a quest to make it to the topmost spot in the food chain .
It 's such a British film that it was never released properly in the States , but in recent years , it 's gained a certain amount of notoriety for painting an advance portrait of the sort of thing that goes on far too often in the current political climate .
That " Michael Rimmer " finally made it to DVD on the same week that Tony Blair left office is arguably one of the best planned release dates in recent memory .
38 .
Romance with a Double Bass ( 1974 ) – Adapted from the Anton Chekov short story of the same name , this is a short film which stars Cleese as Smychkov , a bassist who shows up too early for the ball of a beautiful princess and decides to spend his extra time skinny - dipping in a nearby lake , where the princess is doing a bit of dipping as well .
Problems ensue , however , when a thief absconds with their clothes , leading the two to team up in an attempt to get the princess to the ball without public embarrassment .
Believe it or not , there are reasons to see the film beyond the fact that it provides an opportunity to see Connie Booth completely naked : it 's a sweetly romantic story with enjoyable performances by both of its stars .
37 .
Fawlty Towers ( 1975 ) – Hoteliers , let this be a warning to you : if you 're belligerent and obnoxious to your guests , you may very well end up having a classic sitcom inspired by your antics .
Such was the case for Donald Sinclair , owner of the Gleneagles Hotel in Torquay , whose behavior was so utterly outrageous that it motivated John Cleese to create " Fawlty Towers . "
Cleese plays Basil Fawlty , a snobbish , bullheaded , self - absorbed individual who barely tolerates his daily existence as the owner of Fawlty Towers .
His wife Sybil ( Prunella Scales ) is driving him mad , his employees Polly ( Connie Booth ) and Manuel ( Andrew Sachs ) annoy him almost as much , and do n't even get him started on the guests .
" Fawlty Towers " is n't just a great Britcom ; it 's one of the funniest television shows of all time .
Only one word of warning : when discussing it , do n't mention the war .
( We did once , but we think we got away with it all right . )
36 .
Ripping Yarns ( 1976 ) –
It has been said that the follies of our youth are in retrospect glorious when compared to the follies of our old age …or , at least , that 's what Michael Palin attempts to say – repeatedly – at the beginning of the first episode of " Ripping Yarns , " the post - Python anthology series that he devised with Terry Jones .
Loosely inspired by Tom Brown 's Schooldays , by Thomas Hughes , if the title alone does n't give you the idea that " Ripping Yarns " is veddy , veddy British , it certainly wo n't take the screening of more than a single episode to pick up on it .
Spoofing various genres from within what might be described as the UK equivalent of " Boys ' Life , " the show was rather hit or miss , but it will certainly be a delight for any Python fans that have n't seen it .
Just do n't go in expecting sketches : each episode is an adventure unto itself .
35 .
Saturday Night Live ( 1976 - 1984 ) – Idle and Palin hosted NBC 's long - running late - night series four times each during the course of the ‘ 70s and ‘ 80s .
For his part , Idle will likely never forget finding himself in New Orleans for the 1977 prime - time " SNL " special , " Live from Mardi Gras , " an event which seemed to go wrong at every turn and was disrupted by rowdy fans , malfunctioning technology , and a parade which never arrived .
Palin's " classic " moment , however , involved an opening monologue where – do n't ask why – he put two live cats down the front of his trousers .
The cats , less than certain about their predicament , then proceeded to defecate , and it is said that , due to the quick turnaround time between the monologue and the first sketch , you can see Dan Aykroyd 's nose twitch unhappily as the scent of cat shit wafts into range .
34 .
Jabberwocky ( 1977 ) – Come on , everybody now : " ' Twas brillig , and the slithy toves / Did gyre and gimble in the wabe /
All mimsy were the borogoves /
And the mome raths outgrabe . "
Boy , that sure wreaked hell on the old Spell Check , but how better to pay tribute to one of Lewis Carroll 's most famous literary contributions ?
If you 're tempted to reply , " By having several members of Monty Python adapt it to film , " well , let 's be honest : " Jabberwocky " is n't the best thing Terry Gilliam 's ever directed .
But , then , it was his first film , after all , and it does offer an early look at the concept of a " creaking bureaucracy , " something which Gilliam would later explore far more effectively in " Brazil . "
33 .
The Muppet Show ( 1977 ) –
It 's somewhat surprising that John Cleese was the only member of the Python troupe to serve as a host of " The Muppet Show , " given that the series filmed in the UK , but there 's little question that he made the most of his appearance .
The running gag throughout the episode is that Cleese has little interest in doing the show in the first place , even going so far as to include a " No Pigs " clause in his contract .
( Addressing Kermit , he says , " Here we are : it says I only work with the frog - that 's you , right ?
- the bear , and the ugly disgusting little one that catches cannonballs . " )
Possibly owing to an issue with the fine print , Cleese still ends up doing a " Pigs in Space " sketch , as well as a bit of stretching with Gonzo , but the battle over trying to get him to do a song for the closing number is what 's really priceless .
Fortunately , the relationship between Cleese and the Muppets was patched up enough for him to make an appearance in " The Great Muppet Caper . "
32 .
The Rutles : All You Need Is Cash ( 1978 ) – The legend of Ron Nasty , Dirk McQuickly , Stig O'Hara , and Barry Wom – known collectively as the Rutles – has lasted far more than a lunchtime , but " All You Need Is Cash " never would have come to pass without the combined efforts of Eric Idle and Neil Innes , the former Bonzo Dog Doo -Dah Band member who has often been referred to as the unofficial 7th member of Python .
( You may remember him as the leader of Sir Robin 's minstrels in " Holy Grail . " )
Arguably the greatest mockumentary this side of " This Is Spinal Tap , " " All You Need Is Cash " remains the definitive Beatles parody , skewering their history and their music , with the latter so successful at capturing the feel of the Fab Four that a lawsuit was filed which led to some Rutles songs – including the infamous " Cheese and Onions " – receiving an addition co-writing credit for Lennon & McCartney .
That seems to have been the domain of the lawyers , however , as there are documented reports that all four Beatles enjoyed the Rutles , at least to some degree .
Granted , Innes has said that McCartney was a bit frosty to Idle for awhile in the post - Rutles era , but Idle claims that Paul eventually came around because Linda thought the film was funny .
31 .
Taming of the Shrew ( 1980 ) – As adaptations of this particular work by the Bard often descend into slapstick , it has been said that John Cleese agreed to undertake the role of Petruchio only after he was assured it would not be the typical sort of " Shrew " production he disliked , i.e. one in which there is " a lot of furniture being knocked over , a lot of wine being spilled , a lot of thighs being slapped and a lot of unmotivated laughter . "
It 's fair to say that things worked out as Cleese wanted : in describing Cleese 's version , the website Bardolatry.com said , " Lowbrow physical comedy takes a backseat to lowbrow bawdy wordplay , " adding that " the acting excels across - the - board . "
30 .
Time Bandits ( 1981 ) – Terry Gilliam came a long way between " Jabberwocky " and this film , which takes an 11 - year - old boy named Kevin on a trip through time and space with a bunch of dwarves as they try to evade the so - called Supreme Being .
Throughout their travels , they meet up with several historical figures of note : John Cleese plays the most polite Robin Hood in movie history , Sean Connery is Agamemnon , and Ian Holm offers up an appropriate grouchy performance as Napoleon .
Written by Gilliam and Palin , who also turns up within the cast , " Time Bandits " is one of the most enjoyable films of the ‘ 80s , serving as the perfect bit of escapism for kids while proving both funny and exciting enough to keep their parents entertained .
29 .
The Missionary ( 1982 ) – Rev. Charles Fortescue ( Palin ) is a missionary who , after a decade in Africa , has returned to England to wed his sweetheart .
The bad news …?
She 's not interested in helping him make up for lost time , as it were .
The worse news …?
His new assignment is to minister to the prostitutes of London .
Throw in the fact that the woman who 's funding the assignment ( Maggie Smith ) will only continue to dole out the money if Rev. Fortescue goes to bed with her , and just watch the famed British embarrassment flow .
28 .
Yellowbeard ( 1983 ) – Graham Chapman really only took two out - of - Python starring turns in his career : 1978 's " The Odd Job , " and this all - star comedy , which – despite the star power – never comes anywhere close to being as funny as it should be …which is an astonishing accomplishment , as the cast includes two other Pythons ( Cleese and Idle ) , Peter Cook , Marty Feldman , and Spike Milligan , Peter Boyle , Madeline Kahn , and even Cheech and Chong .
Nonetheless , as comedies go , this one is pretty lackluster .
" Yellowbeard " received a bit of recent reevaluation after " Pirates of the Caribbean " set the box office on fire and led to just about every pirate - related film in cinematic history getting a DVD release , and Chapman does still manager to offer us some laughs , but overall it still goes down as a disappointment .
27 .
A Private Function ( 1984 ) – Michael Palin teams again with Maggie Smith to play husband and wife in this 1947 - set comedy about a small English town still suffering through the food rationing which came about during World War II .
Some local businessmen who want to hold a party to celebrate the royal wedding of Princess Elizabeth to Prince Philip decide to illegally raise a pig to eat for the occasion ; the pig , however , is stolen by Gilbert Chilvers ( Palin ) on the orders of his wife , Joyce ( Smith ) .
Shenanigans , unsurprisingly , ensue .
26 .
Brazil ( 1985 ) –
The problem with films which present a vision of the future is that they can sometimes look positively laughable in as little as a few years ' time .
Not so with Terry Gilliam 's " Brazil , " which has , if anything , come to look even more prescient now than it did upon its initial release .
Sam Lowry ( Jonathan Pryce ) works in a boring job , lives in a small apartment , and suffers through life under a government not so terribly removed from George Orwell 's vision in " 1984 , " but in his dreams , he envisions a beautiful woman that he wants to find in the real world .
Palin plays Jack Lint , who believes that his old friend Sam is actually part of a terrorist plot .
This comes about due to a bureaucratic mishap … which , of course , is something that never happens .
( Riiiiiiight . )
Call it sci - fi noir or retro-futurism , " Brazil " definitely still holds up as well in 2009 as it did in 1985 , but if you want the full picture , be sure to pick up Criterion 's DVD release , which at 3 discs offers more " Brazil " than you can shake a stick at .
25 .
European Vacation ( 1985 ) –
When ranking the four films featuring Clark Griswold and his family , " European Vacation " generally lands squarely in the third place spot , but it 's still a relatively funny flick , having provided the world with at least one imminently quotable line : " Look , kids !
Big Ben! Parliament ! "
And if there 's one running gag which consistently gets a laugh , it 's the poor Brit played by Eric Idle who manages to get injured every time he comes into proximity of the Griswolds .
Still , he manages to remain as polite as you 'd expect ( " No problem , squire , no harm done , does n't hurt much at all " ) , though you can sense that it 's wearing a bit thin by the end of the film , when he sighs , " Still on holiday , are you ? "
24 .
Silverado ( 1985 ) –
The suggestion that Lawrence Kasdan 's " Silverado " brought back the Western genre is n't entirely true , since it's not like there was really a major proliferation of new cowboy flicks in its wake , but it definitely showed that Westerns could still be cool .
Amongst the awesome cast of Americans ( Kevin Costner , Kevin Kline , Danny Glover , Scott Glenn , Brian Dennehy , and Jeff Goldblum all appear ) , we have a token Python : Cleese , who plays Sheriff John T. Langston , a slightly overenthusiastic Englishman who has perhaps cleaned up the town of Turley a bit too much .
23 .
Spies Like Us ( 1985 ) – Terry Gilliam has always spent so much time behind the camera or at the drawing board that he 's rarely been interested in doing any acting , and that does n't change much with his brief role in this film , where his big dramatic reading as Dr. Imhaus involves asking the question " Have we received the last shipment of penicillin yet ? "
He does have one big claim to fame in the film , however : he 's responsible for setting off the lengthy series of introductions between Emmett Fitz - Hume , Austin Millbarge , and the other physicians .
" Doctor ? " " Doctor . " " Doctor ? " " Doctor . "
And so on .
22 .
Clockwise ( 1986 ) –
Are you one of those people who lives their life on a highly regimented schedule , never veering away from it , no matter what the cost ?
Then you 'll appreciate how completely flustered Brian Stimpson ( Cleese ) , headmaster of Thomas Tompion Comprehensive School , gets when his notorious punctuality fails him while attempting to attend a speaking engagement at a conference of fellow headmasters .
Watching Stimpson completely fall apart is hysterical , and as Cleese films go , this one tends to rank not far below " A Fish Called Wanda " with those who 've seen it , but it remains relatively unknown , as it only scored limited theatrical release in the States .
If you can find it on video , however , you 're in for a treat .
21 .
Labyrinth ( 1986 ) –
We admit it : this feels a bit like cheating by including this film in our list , since no member of Python actually appears in it .
( At the very least , it goes against the spirit of the Gilliam rule we established in the intro . )
But it 's so rarely mentioned that Terry Jones helped to co-write the script of " Labyrinth " that we felt like it was our job to get the information out there a bit more .
Kim " Howard " Johnson 's book , " Life Before and After Monty Python – The Solo Flights of the Flying Circus , " Jones acknowledged that Jim Henson had the original idea for the film , " but I really agreed to do it in the basis of the characters .
I wanted to have a fairly free hand at the episodes .
I just started fresh , using the same characters .
I 'd undertaken the thing in a rather cavalier fashion .
I 'd read their synopsis , and they'd had a novella of the film - to - be .
It was about ninety pages of story , and I thought it did n't work at all , so originally I said I was n't interested .
Then after a couple of bottles of wine with Jim , I said " All right , maybe I 'll spend three weeks writing and see if something comes up . ' "
And something did .
20 .
Cheers ( 1987 ) – Although Cleese received Emmy nominations for his guest appearances on both " Will and Grace " and " 3rd Rock from the Sun , " his only win to date came courtesy of what is remembered by most as one of the funniest " Cheers " episodes of all time .
Cleese played Dr. Simon Finch - Royce , one of Frasier Crane 's former colleagues and a well - regarded marriage counselor , but when he declares Sam and Diane utterly unfit to be man and wife , the two refuse to believe his assessment and proceed to hound him into insanity .
In a desperate attempt to get them to leave , so that he might get some sleep , he opens his hotel window and shouts to the world , " Hear this , world : the rest of you can stop getting married .
It 's been done to perfection .
Envy them , sofa , envy them , chair , for you shall never be as cozy as they , for their union shall be an epoch - shattering success , and I stake my life on it . "
Dr. Finch - Royce never appeared on the series again .
We presume that it is because he died .
19 .
The Mikado ( 1987 ) – Given that Eric Idle was the member of Python who sang lead on the group 's most memorable number ( " Always Look on the Bright Side of Life " ) and later managed to turn " Monty Python and the Holy Grail " into a Broadway extravaganza , it should be rather easy to accept that , in the late ‘ 80s , he was game to tackle a Gilbert and Sullivan production .
Idle tackles the lead role , Ko- Ko , the tailor who is appointed Lord High Executioner and must find someone to execute before the arrival of the Mikado , a .k.a. the emperor of Japan .
Oh , except that this version takes place in a British seaside resort toward the end of the Art Nouveau period of the 1920s .
Idle turns in a fine performance , and the costuming looks extremely cool , but your appreciation will come down to whether or not you enjoy a good musical .
18 .
The Adventures of Baron Munchausen ( 1988 ) – If " Brazil " was the film that first gave Terry Gilliam the reputation of being a filmmaker interested in making his films look good , no matter what the cost , then " Munchausen " cemented that status .
Its cost varies wildly depending on which source you use ( we 're pretty sure it was somewhere between $ 23.5 million and $ 46.63 million ) , but given that it only made about $ 8 million , it was an unquestioned box office flop .
Critics , however , tend to really dig it , and at the very least , you can see the money Gilliam spent to bring his vision to the screen .
John Neville 's performance as the Baron is wonderful , as is the supporting cast , featuring Idle as Munchausen 's fleet - footed associate , Berthold , Robin Williams as the King of the Moon , and Uma Thurman – who looks particularly breathtaking as Venus .
17 .
A Fish Called Wanda ( 1988 ) –
You can argue about the relative merits of " Brazil " ‘ til the cow drops , but when it comes to determining the single best post - Python film , we 'll stand by " A Fish Called Wanda " every single time .
Although it 's centered around a jewel heist and features a few well - helmed action scenes ( thank you , Charles Crichton ) , make no mistake : this is one of the funniest comedies of the 1980s , if not the 20th century .
John Cleese wrote the script , giving himself the plum role of Archie Leach , a lawyer who , as a result of defending George , one of the jewel thieves , finds himself being seduced by Wanda ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) , who wants to know where George has hidden the loot .
Archie 's married , but unhappily so , making him easy prey for Wanda , but she surprises herself by actually falling for him , a turn of events which frustrates her partner , Otto ( Kevin Kline ) .
Michael Palin also appears , playing Ken , George 's right hand man .
Bit of a stutterer , our Ken , but a good chap overall .
Watching Cleese and Kline interact never fails to be hilarious , but in truth , " A Fish Called Wanda " is uproarious from start to finish .
16 .
Jake 's Journey ( 1988 ) –
This might well have made it higher on the list were it not a pilot for a TV series which was never actually picked up , but those who were witness to the 2004 ABC special , " The Best TV Shows That Never Were , " have seen enough to testify that it had the potential to be for Graham Chapman what " A Fish Called Wanda " is for John Cleese .
Seemingly inspired as much by " Monty Python and the Holy Grail " as " A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur 's Court , " the show found a modern - day American teenager hurled into a medieval world filled with knights , witches , ogres , and even talking lobsters .
Sadly , CBS opted out of the series ( reportedly because its sensibilities were too British ) , and – probably coincidentally – Chapman died not long after .
15 .
Michael Palin : Around the World in 80 Days ( 1989 ) – Palin has done so many travel documentaries over the past two decades that there 's literally an entire generation who knows him better for his work in that genre than they do for his time as a member of Python .
This , however , is the one that really got the ball rolling for him .
Taking his cue from Jules Verne 's novel , in addition to maintaining the same deadline as Phineas Fogg , Palin forbade himself from using any kind of transportation that did not exist in Verne 's time …or , in other words , airplanes were a no - no .
Palin attempted to mirror
Fogg 's route as well , and with his trusty film crew ( a five - man group collectively known as Passaporte ) , presented his experiences to BBC viewers as well as readers , later offering a book which offers far more details than could ever have been fit into a miniseries .
14 .
The Big Picture ( 1989 ) – Christopher Guest is so well known for his mockumentary method of filmmaking that it's often forgotten that , between " This is Spinal Tap " and " Waiting for Guffman , " he made a " normal " film that 's pretty darned good .
Filled to the brim with a list of top talent which includes Kevin Bacon , Jennifer Jason Leigh , and a hilarious but uncredited Martin Short , the designated Python representative within " The Big Picture " is Mr. Cleese , who plays a bartender in a brief black - and - white moment inspired by " It 's A Wonderful Life . "
( " I can't serve you no more , Mr. Chapman , it 's no good for you .
It 's eating up your insides . " )
It may be short , but it 's certainly sweet .
13 .
Erik the Viking ( 1989 ) – Upon its initial release , Roger Ebert gave " Erik " a staggering zero - star rating , describing it as " an utterly worthless exercise in waste and wretched excess , uninformed by the slightest spark of humor , wit or coherence . "
It 's not as bad as all that …and , really , how could it be ?... but even its defenders would likely agree that Terry Jones – who wrote , directed , and starred in the film – did n't end up pulling together the Viking equivalent of " Holy Grail " that this had the potential to be .
Still , there 's something endearing about the idea of a cast that includes Jones , Cleese , Tim Robbins , Eartha Kitt , and Mickey Rooney .
In 2006 , a " Director 's Son 's Cut " of the film – helmed by Bill Jones – was released on DVD , featuring re-ordered scenes , tighter pacing , and a completely remixed and re-dubbed soundtrack .
One suspects , however , that Ebert probably still would n't like it .
12 .
Nuns on the Run ( 1990 ) – With a title like " Nuns on the Run , " you know it 's going to be a silly affair , and , indeed , that 's precisely what it is .
Idle and Robbie Coltrane – best known to American audiences as Hagrid in the " Harry Potter " films – play Brian and Charlie , two semi-competent petty criminals who decide to take the money and run , as it were , from their gang .
Unfortunately , they botch their escape and are forced to seek refuge in a convent , pretending to be nuns .
Those who practice Catholicism will know : is it possible that these are two of the ugliest nuns ever ?
Brian would n't know : he 's not Catholic .
As a result , Charlie has to give his partner a crash course in order to help perpetuate their fraud .
It 's all very silly , often falling into legitimate stupidity , but it has its charms .
Not many of them , perhaps , but some , certainly .
11 .
American Friends ( 1991 ) –
Though comparatively few people have seen the film , this period romance was a very personal project for Palin , who based the screenplay on a story taken from his great - grandfather 's diary .
The film revolves around Francis Ashby ( Palin ) , an Oxford academic who , while hiking the Swiss Alps , meets two Americans – Caroline Hartley ( Connie Booth ) and her 18 - year - old ward , Elinor ( Trini Alvarado ) – and finds that he has feelings for them both , particularly Elinor .
Do n't go looking for laughs , but if you 'd like to see a fine dramatic performance by Palin , it 's well worth your time .
10 .
G.B.H. ( 1991 ) – On a roll with his dramatic roles , Palin also participated in this miniseries – which , to be fair , has some funny moments , too – about the British government trying to discredit a Militant Labour leader Michael Murray ( played by Robert Lindsay ) and thereby end his political momentum .
Given that we 're talking about the government , it 's no surprise that the plan to take down Murray is incredibly complicated , and in the process of trying to keep himself safe , Murray crosses paths with Jim Nelson ( Palin ) , who serves as the headmaster of a school for disturbed children .
If the only reason you 've heard of " G.B.H. " is because Elvis Costello composed the soundtrack , you should really check it out : yes , Palin 's good , but it 's a uniformly strong production throughout .
9 .
Splitting Heirs ( 1993 ) –
The fact that " Splitting Heirs " has never been released in England probably tells you all you really need to know about the film 's dispensability .
The premise revolves around a British lord and duchess accidentally leaving their son and heir in a restaurant and having the child switched out by the cook ; the true heir is adopted by an Indian family in London , and the other baby is raised by the duchess in America .
Fast - forward 25 or so years :
Idle plays Tommy Patel , the true heir , and Rick Moranis is Henry Bullock , the imposter who does n't know he 's an imposter .
In truth , though , neither actor is the best reason to see the film .
You 'll enjoy watching Barbara Hershey and Catherine Zeta Jones a lot more , and in typical fashion , John Cleese steals the film in his role as Raoul P. Shadgrind , a lawyer who tries to kill Bullock but fails miserably in his attempts .
8 .
The Crusades ( 1995 ) – The idea of having one of the stars of " Monty Python and the Holy Grail " serve as your host through a trip through the history of the Crusades sounds like a match made in heaven … and it is .
In addition to serving as the narrator for this History Channel series , Terry Jones appears onscreen as well , touring several significant locations from the era in question as well as demonstrating the lifestyle of those who lived through the Crusades .
( It 's a rough life to get paid to take a Turkish bath .
Jones manages to bring his customary wit to the subject at hand , successfully lightening up a pretty dark period ( no pun intended ) in history and educating viewers in the process .
If this is n't actually used in history classes , it certainly should be .
7 .
Mr. Toad 's Wild Ride ( 1996 ) – First of all , if you 're British , then you 'll better know this film as " The Wind in the Willows . "
And second of all , if you 're American , then you possibly wo n't know this film at all , as it took three years to score Stateside release , due to its distributor – Disney – having precious little faith that it would translate well to kids in the U.S.
They were right , of course , but it 's still a great deal of fun for Anglophiles , providing a rare reunion of Idle , Palin , Cleese , and Jones ( who also directed ) , with additional assistance from fellow funny Brits Steve Coogan , Stephen Fry , and Nigel Planer ( Neil from " The Young Ones " ) and music courtesy of John Du Prez , who went on to co-write " Spamalot ! " with Idle .
6 .
Fierce Creatures ( 1997 ) – Obviously , no one can watch the reunion of Cleese , Palin , Kline , and Curtis without comparing it to their first go - round , " A Fish Called Wanda , " but if you approach " Fierce Creatures " with a desire for a slightly randy slapstick romp , it 's pleasant enough .
Cleese plays Rollo Lee , who takes over management responsibilities for the Marwood Zoo , which is owned by Australian tycoon Rod McCain ( Kline ) , but Rollo 's attempts to suck up to " Rod almighty , " his skeevy son Vince ( also played by Kline ) , and McCain 's new employee , Willa Weston ( Curtis ) , lead to near revolt amongst the zoo employees , one of whom – Adrian " Bugsy " Malone – is played by Palin .
It 's fun to catch the " Wanda " and Python references throughout the film ( at one point , someone remarks about " beautiful plumage " ) , but it 's mostly just enjoyable to see these four actors getting the opportunity to have a bit more fun together .
5 .
The Out - of - Towners ( 1999 ) – Someone at Paramount may have been convinced that the time was right for a remake of Neil Simon 's 1970 film , but there are very few who would suggest that Steve Martin and Goldie Hawn came anywhere near the performances of Jack Lemmon and Sandy Dennis .
Thank goodness for Cleese , who livened up the film by offering a twist on his classic Basil Fawlty persona as the hotel manager … though Basil was never caught dancing to Donna Summer 's " Bad Girls . "
Still , if you want to see him in cranky hotelier mode , you 're far better off watching " Fawlty Towers " instead .
4 .
In the Wild : Lemurs with John Cleese ( 1999 ) – Although the more predictable animal - related inclusion from Mr. Cleese would be the 1994 live action version of " The Jungle Book , " we 're quite partial to this PBS special .
In 1988 , five black and white ruffed lemurs that had been bred in captivity were released into the wild in an attempt to help kickstart the re-population of the species .
As a near - lifelong fan of the lemur , Cleese embarked upon an expedition – one which took him by plane , French colonial train , jeep , and foot – to find the lemurs and see how things were going .
It 's a bit rough going for Cleese , given that he 's got a bum knee , but he maintains his sense of humor throughout , and the lemurs are as cute as the dickens .

The World Is Not Enough ( 1999 ) / Die Another Day ( 2002 ) – Although Desmond Llewellyn appeared as Q in every James Bond film from 1963 to 1999 save " Live and Let Die , " it was only inevitable that the time would come for him to pass the torch onto another letter .
In " The World is Not Enough , " John Cleese was introduced to the Bond universe as R…or , at least , that 's what 007 presumed his character 's name to be .
In return , Mr. Bond received a snarky response typical of the Q Branch : " Ah , yes , the legendary 007 wit…or , at least , half of it . "
By the time " Die Another Day " rolled around , Llewellyn had passed on , leaving Cleese as the new head of the Q Branch .
Sadly , however , the reinvention of the Bond flicks which began with " Casino Royale " has had no place for a Python in its ranks .
More 's the pity : they could do with a bit of lightening up .

Harry Potter and the Sorcerer 's Stone ( 2001 ) / Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets ( 2002 ) – Cleese also found his way into another film franchise as the new millennium began , though his appearances as Nearly Headless Nick in the " Harry Potter " films were fleeting .
He 's only turned up in two of them thus far , and even in those , his presence has tended to only last long enough for viewers to say , " Hey , look , it 's John Cleese ! "
Rumors had floated around that Nick would be returning in " Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix , " but there was no sign of him , and the likelihood of seeing him again in " The Deathly Hallows " seems slim .
Oh , well , we 'll always have the Chamber of Secrets …

Rat Race ( 2001 ) – Ever since the release of " It 's A Mad , Mad , Mad , Mad World " in 1963 , Hollywood has made sporadic attempts to recreate the fun of that film , but they 've never managed to capture the same kind of magic .
Still , " Rat Race " came closer than most .
Cleese plays Donald Sinclair , the eccentric billionaire owner of the Venetian Resort Hotel Casino , who sends six teams on a quest to a train station in Silver City , New Mexico , where a duffel bag containing two million dollars is residing in a locker .
Each team has a key to the locker , and the first team who gets there wins the money .
Cleese does most of his work during the film 's bookends , but given that the cast includes Rowan Atkinson , Seth Green , Jon Lovitz , Dave Thomas , Wayne Knight , Kathy Najimy , and Breckin Meyer , it 's not like you wo n't be entertained between his appearances .
Honorable Mention : Spamalot ( 2004 ) –
It bears the Python name , so it seemed wrong to put it within the list proper , but having watched " Monty Python : Almost the Truth , " it seems evident that the other four surviving Pythons basically let Eric Idle run with his idea for a " Holy Grail " - inspired musical .
In the documentary , they all conceded that he was the one in the group who had a way with songs , and he proved it in a big way with " Spamalot , " which received 14 Tony Award nominations and took home the award for Best Musical of the 2004 –2005 season .
Co-written with John Du Prez , the musical has played in New York , Chicago , Las Vegas , London 's West End , Australia and New Zealand , Spain , Germany , and Sweden , so it 's fair to say that " Spamalot " will keep Monty Python 's legacy alive for many years to come .
Still , as Terry Jones acknowledged , " It is n't really Python .
It 's very much Eric . "
President Obama was met with cheers and jeers Thursday in his first visit to San Francisco as commander in chief , telling a friendly crowd at a sold - out Democratic Party fundraiser that while " some of our opponents think they can wear us out , I 'm not tired - I 'm refreshed . "
America is " closer than we have ever been " on health care reform , he said , and promised to follow through with efforts to develop green technology and tackle difficult problems around the globe .
" Iraq was hard .
Afghanistan is harder , " Obama told supporters .
" Iran , seeking to develop nuclear weapons , is hard .
The Middle East peace process , that 's hard .
These are not problems that are going to be solved overnight .
They 're not going to be solved in nine months .
They 're not going to be solved in 18 months " and " maybe not in 36 months , " he said .
" We 're just getting started . "
Obama 's appearance at the fundraiser presented him a friendlier reception than one earlier in the day in New Orleans , where he took criticism from some officials for what they considered a too - brief stopover to hear about the continued fallout from Hurricane Katrina .
In a city that former President George W. Bush never visited while in office , Obama was greeted with wild applause from a capacity audience of more than 900 Democratic supporters who paid $ 500 to $ 1,000 to see him at the Westin St. Francis Hotel , where he starred at a reception to benefit the Democratic National Committee .
Earlier , he dropped into an exclusive VIP dinner at the hotel 's penthouse for about 160 high - level party donors , some of whom wrote checks of $ 30,400 or more for a pair of tickets and the privilege of shaking hands and taking a picture with him .
The two events were expected to raise about $ 3 million , Democratic Party officials said .
Among those in the crowd were House Speaker Nancy Pelosi , D - San Francisco ; Lt. Gov. John Garamendi , former Democratic state Controller Steve Westly , a major fundraiser for Obama ; Wade Randlett , a Silicon Valley insider and key Democratic fundraiser ; former state Democratic Party Chairman Art Torres ; former San Francisco Supervisor Amos Brown ; and Eric Jaye , the former chief strategist to Mayor Gavin Newsom .
Newsom , a candidate for governor in next year 's election who served as a co-chairman of Sen.
Hillary Rodham Clinton 's 2008 presidential campaign , was attending his own campaign fundraiser in Texas , along with a meeting on innovation .
Out on the streets
On the streets outside the hotel , Obama 's reception was less enthusiastic , with protesters on the left and right hurling criticisms of his policies and leadership style .
" People in the Bay Area are very sensitive to the two critical issues right now - health care and Afghanistan - and they 're unhappy on both fronts , " said Medea Benjamin , co-founder of the anti-war group Code Pink .
" They want single - payer and they want an exit strategy . "
Obama is backing health care reforms that include private and government insurance plans , while he is considering whether to send more troops to Afghanistan amid a Taliban insurgency .
Benjamin said she was disappointed Obama was n't being seen outside high - priced political events .
" It would have been good for the president to hear from the Bay Area , and it would have helped to release his inner progressive , " she said .
" We know it 's there somewhere .
You just have to dig deep these days . "
Jodie Evans , a co-founder of Code Pink , paid $ 30,400 for a pair of tickets to the VIP dinner , where she presented Obama with a petition from women in Afghanistan urging him not to send additional troops .
Evans said she spent several minutes discussing the war there with the president and told him that the country 's women " want a place at the table " in resolving the conflict .
' Issue of the hour '
Pelosi , who introduced the president , said that " health care is the issue of the hour . "
Obama , she said , has been a president who knew that reform was n't " about the details of the policy , it was about something bigger .
It was about our moral responsibility ... social responsibility and the character of our country . "
The Obama visit to San Francisco began in late afternoon when Air Force One landed at San Francisco International Airport , and the president - after a bite to eat - was whisked downtown .
He planned to stay overnight at the Intercontinental Hotel , and there were no official plans for any public events or special meetings with city or state leaders .
The White House said he would leave this morning for Houston to attend a " Thousand Points of Light " event with former President George H.W. Bush .
Before he landed in San Francisco , Obama took heat from Louisiana voters and elected officials Thursday for making a whirlwind trip of less than four hours to highlight the continuing damage from 2005 's Hurricane Katrina .
" Four years ago , right after the storm , a lot of people here felt forgotten , " he said .
" But because everybody worked hard , everybody kept hopeful , everybody was determined to rebuild - you now see a school that is doing much better than it was ever doing before the storm . "
Obama then went to a town hall meeting with a selected audience at the University of New Orleans .
The quick schedule did n't sit well with some political leaders .
Sen . Mary Landrieu , D - La. , also said that the president 's trip there " could have been longer " and acknowledged that Louisiana residents were " a little disappointed and frustrated , but understanding that the president has a lot on his plate . "
Obama defended himself Thursday , reassuring the town hall meeting that his administration is " working as hard as we can , as quickly as we can " to address their concerns about the lingering devastation from the 2005 catastrophe .
Is Your Escrow Money Safe ?
Maybe Not .
You buy a home with an FHA loan .
Every month , you pay not only your principle , but PMI ( Private Mortgage Insurance ) , and property taxes .
When property tax time comes around , the mortgage company takes the money you ’ve been paying every month out of the escrow account and pays your taxes .
When you refinance a home , you still have to pay the taxes with your new mortgage company .
We did this recently ( more about my refinance next week ) .
We paid almost a full year of property taxes with our new mortgage company , Bank of America .
And we had a refund of almost the same amount due us from our old mortgage company , Taylor , Bean , and Whitaker .
Last week we received our refund .
I deposited it into the bank .
The bank held it for a few days and then made the funds available , so I transferred money to our Capital One 360 Savings account .
This morning I woke up to an overdrafted checking account to the tune of $ 880.00 .
What happened ?
The Taylor , Bean , & Whitaker Check Bounced
Apparently , the feds raided Taylor , Bean , & Whitaker on August 5th , a couple of weeks after our refinance closed .
They filed bankruptcy on August 24th .
Which leads to the question … what happens to the escrow money ?
The very purpose of escrow is to keep funds safe , so they can be used for a specific purpose .
In this case , the funds were to be used to pay property taxes .
But since we refinanced with a different bank , and we paid property taxes into a new escrow account , the money should have been returned to us .
And it should have been no problem , because the point of escrow is to hold money .
The money should have been there .
So what happened to the money ?
Colonial Bank is Shut Down by the Feds
Apparently Taylor , Bean , & Whitaker used Colonial Bank frequently .
Mortgage payments were deposited there .
Employees were paid from Colonial Bank .
Sometimes from the same account as the mortgages were deposited into , according to NBC 11 .
That does n’t reassure me that my money and that of many other Taylor , Bean , & Whitaker customers was kept safe .
So the question remains :
What happened to the money ?
Taylor , Bean , & Whitaker ’s Answer
I called Taylor , Bean , & Whitaker to find out what was going on .
After being on hold for an hour , I finally got through to Ramona .
Yes , she assured me , they were aware that checks were bouncing .
The reason was that the bank they used had ceased and desisted .
( Colonial Bank , perhaps ? )
But they are going to reissue checks from a new bank , I was assured .
My new check should arrive in “ a few weeks . ”
So I asked the obvious question .
“ How long is a few weeks ?
Three ?
Six ? ”
She told me two .
I ’m not holding my breath , but I ’ll let you know if the check gets here … and does n’t bounce .
So what is the fallout ?
And what happens to the consumers in the meanwhile ?
The Consumers are Left Holding the Bag
I ca n’t speak for everyone , but I can tell you what life is like for us .
First of all , we had 8 transactions bounce in our checking account with Chase this morning .
Chase charges $ 25 for each failed transaction , for a total of $ 200 .
But they only charge for the first 6 transactions , I ’m told , so the total is $ 150 .
Chase told me they ’d give me a one time courtesy credit of $ 70 , which is the maximum they could give me .
So I ’m out $ 80 .
Fortunately payday is tomorrow , so we ’ll be in the black again .
Barely .
My husband ’s paycheck will be about enough to cover what we owe at this point , so we wo n’t be spending any money for the next few days at least .
Fortunately we do n’t have any bills due , and our pantry and freezer are stocked , so we ’re fine .
I think we have enough gas in our cars , too .
Since I had just moved the money over to 360 Checking , I could n’t transfer it right back .
We had a little extra in 360 Checking that should hit our bank account on Tuesday , so by then we should be OK .
I truly feel for those who do n’t have an emergency fund at all and for those whose paydays are not tomorrow .
As I was researching this morning , it seems that consumers with their taxes still held at Taylor , Bean , & Whitaker are unsure their property taxes will be paid at all .
It Makes Me Angry
Thousands of families in the United States work hard .
We do the best we can to manage our money .
We do n’t bounce checks , even when money is tight .
And when our money is put into an escrow account , we trust that it will be kept safe .
And when a financial institution issues a check , we expect that it is good .
And in one moment , when a financial institution has n’t performed ethically , and a bank is shut down , and a lender declares bankruptcy , the lives of hundreds of consumers are turned upside down .
We ’re left without our money , that we worked hard to earn .
We ’re left with overdraft fees to pay .
Fees that are not our fault .
We ’re left wondering whether we ’ll need to come up with another $ 1500 by November , so our property taxes will be paid .
We have to cut through the red tape .
We waste an hour of our morning on the phone , just to find out where the money went .
We wonder whether this is in any way covered by the FDIC .
We wonder if the check we ’ve been promised will indeed show up in the mail .
And if it does , we wonder if it will bounce again .
I ’m glad we ’re going to be OK .
We ’re tight , and the next couple of months will probably be rough , but I know we ’ll survive this .
But I also know there are families out there devastated by this .
Families who will be reeling from this bank failure for months to come .
And my heart goes out to them .

This post is one of my series of tech talks , describing some of the ways in which fossil fuels are produced .
In the current part of the series we are focusing a little more on the procedures that are being used to recover natural gas from formations such as the Barnett , Fayetteville , Marcellus , Haynesville and Woodford shales .
In this particular post I am going to concentrate more on the benefits of horizontal drilling through these shale reservoirs , rather than using the more conventional vertical wells that were used historically .
This , and the next three posts in the series are likely to be a bit more technically dense than earlier posts , but I am trying to illustrate some of the problems of production , and some of the gains that technology is bringing to help solve some of them .
And while the reason for the horizontal wells can be simplified in this graph from Chris McGill , there are a lot of other things that have to be considered in deciding whether or not the horizontal well is going to be worth developing .
To begin with it ’s probably best to start with rock pressure .
And to explain this I am going to do some simplification , so , as I ask in most of these “ tech talks ” , to those who do know better please understand that this is trying to explain concepts , but also please do comment on where I may either accidentally or by error , get something wrong .
I am also going to repeat some information from earlier posts , since some of you may not have read them .
As we go deeper into the earth , the weight of the ground above us will also increase .
For a very simple measure ( and to make the illustrations easier to follow ) we can assume that this is around a 1 pound per square inch ( psi ) increase for every foot deeper we go .
So if we were , for example , 10,000 ft down then the pressure in the rock due to that weight would , undisturbed , be around 10,000 psi .
( This is about 7 times the pressure that you see coming out of a car wash pressure washer for example ) .
When a oilwell is drilled vertically down into that rock it does not see this pressure , but it does see a part of it .
The reason is that the rock on either side of the hole can now expand into the hole , and we ’d rather it did n’t .
( It ’s somewhat as though you step on a rubber eraser – the eraser will bulge out laterally as it compresses vertically under your weight . )
The resistant pressure in the horizontal direction can be calculated as a function of the vertical pressure through a ratio known as Poisson ’s Ratio .
Sufficient for our discussion to say that it can have a value of about 0.3 .
So that if we are 10,000 ft down , then the vertical pressure on the rock will be around 10,000 psi , and the horizontal pressure will be around 3,000 psi .
If the well is vertical then the casing for the well may not have to resist pressures of more than the 3,000 psi level .
Now , if instead of just drilling the well vertically I turned and drilled it out horizontally through the rock , then the hole would now have the 10,000 psi squeezing down vertically , and the 3,000 psi coming in from the side .
So the first thought that we have is that the casing ( the lining that we put into the hole to make sure that it stays open ) has to be a bit stronger .
Life gets , however , a bit more complicated than that .
When you put a hole into ground that is under pressure , the first response of the rock is to try and move the weight of the rock over the hole onto the rock on the sides of the hole .
This roughly doubles the pressure that is on that thin layer .
Before the hole was put there that particular rock was held in place by the rock around it , and collectively the mass could carry the original pressure .
But now there is no rock where the hole is , and thus the confining pressure on the rock there is less .
( In technical terms you have shifted the load from a triaxial confinement under 10,000 psi to a uniaxial load of 20,000 psi , if there were no pressure within the well . )
The result can be that the rock on the sides of the hole crushes under the load .
This then puts crushed rock or sand into the hole , and that interferes with lots of things .
Now you can possibly stop that by keeping the pressure high in the liquid that you are using inside the hole to get the drilled rock out ( the drilling mud ) , but if you keep that pressure too high , then the oil / gas wo n’t flow to the well and so you have to drop it down to a certain level by choking the flow out of the well when , after completing the hole , you go back to start production .
Life also gets a bit more complicated in reality , since the presence of the fluid in the rock tends to even out the pressure within it .
So that while , relatively close to the surface , and in a dry rock the ratios may be as I gave them earlier , with a fluid saturated rock , and in an over - pressured region , the horizontal pressure can be as high as 80 % or more of the vertical value .
The values generally get closer to 100 % as the wells go even deeper , but that is another story .
So rock pressure is the first problem that you have to deal with .
But why do we drill the horizontal holes in the first place ?
Why ca n’t we just use the old vertical ones .
Well , the reason is that the old ones did n’t work very well .
And to explain that I am gong to try and re-explain an article from Penn State .
( then I ’ll give the relevant quote ) .
Shale is a very fine grained rock , and though gas can gather in the small pores of its structure , if the gas is to flow to a well , then it has to migrate through passages that are very narrow , and thus very resistive to that flow .
However , as the shale has been formed under geological pressure and over time , the pressures not only compressed it from mud into shale , but they also caused it to fracture .
In the Marcellus shale , for example , the cracks that occurred in the shale are roughly vertical , and form two sets that are perpendicular to one another .
The first advantage that a horizontal well has , over a vertical one , is that the well can penetrate a long way through the rock that carries the oil or gas ( OG ) .
The amount of OG that comes from the rock is , in part , a function of how long the length of well is in the rock that carries it .
So that while a vertical well might produce say 800 bd from a well that goes straight through a 200 ft thick layer of oil - bearing rock , when the well is drilled so that it goes out he equivalent of 4 miles horizontally through the oil - bearing rock , then the production per day may go up to 10,000 barrels .
It is not always that easy to find reservoir data from two adjacent wells , one vertical and one horizontal , but I found a paper on Natural Gas by Chris McGill , in 2006 from which I took the following graph .
( For those who want to see what projections on NG were just those few short years ago – the paper is worth a cautionary read . )
Comparative production from a vertical and horizontal natural gas well ( Chris McGill ) .
It is interesting to note ( vide the recent controversy over Arthur Berman ’s opinions on horizontal well life stability of production ) , that the horizontal well here had an operational lifetime of only a year , as opposed to the ten years of the conventional well .
The second advantage relates to the way in which the fractures lie in the rock .
Because they are vertical , a vertical well wo n’t hit very many of them , and so since these fractures provide an easy flow of OG to the well , rather than the difficult path through just the rock , then the well will not show very much production .
( And this was the case with many of these shales when they were tested earlier . )
However if the well is horizontal ( see figure ) then the well will intersect many of these fractures and in drawing the fluid from them will also provide an easy path for fluid to ease out of the rock into the fracture paths , so that the entire rock can be more easily drained .
Simplified picture showing two joint sets ( the grid ) as they could be intersected by a vertical and a horizontal well .
Now in the picture I have shown one set of joints as being bigger than the other .
And that is usually the case , because the horizontal pressure , that earlier I had suggested was the same in each direction , actually usually is n’t .
The strongest horizontal pressure will tend to close up those fractures that run perpendicular to it , and tend to open the ones that run parallel with it .
Thus it helps to know at the level of the shale , what the pressures in the different directions are ( the engineers among us generally refer to them as stresses rather than pressures ) .
The best direction to drill is then perpendicular to the maximum horizontal pressure , if we want to take the best advantage of the fractures in the rock .
The only problem with this is that it also increases the pressures on the sides of the borehole , so that if we go that way , and the rock is not that strong , then we may be making the borehole stability worse .
But even with a horizontal well the production may not be that great , because the fractures are still relatively narrow , and so flow wo n’t be that fast .
And so there is another tool that can be used , and that is to deliberately put a crack into the rock on the side of the borehole .
On a very small scale , if you look at the picture , you can see a shaded zone around the vertical well .
If I could make a crack out from the well at that level and grow it out just a short way you can see that it already intersects two of the better joint sets , whereas at the beginning the well did n’t reach any .
And if we could do this from the horizontal well and grow that crack out a goodly distance horizontally , then it would intersect a lot of the vertical fractures and production would become high and useful .
There are , however , three snags to forming and growing that crack , all solvable , but all costing additional money .
The first is that if we just grow the crack out and then let the weight of the overlying rock close it up again , then we have n’t made a whole lot of difference .
So we have to prop the crack open .
For this we need to inject relatively fine grained particles ( let ’s call it sand , though the technical term is proppant ) into the crack in enough quantity that it will fill up the crack and hold it open so that it gives an easy path through the rock to the well for the OG .
( We wo n’t go into what a mess pumping sand at more than 10,000 psi makes of the pump – Halliburton gets paid very nicely to fix those problems . )
The second snag is that trying to push sand into a thin crack and get it to go very far can be an exercise in futility .
Among other things if you are using plain water the sand tends to settle to the bottom rather fast , and if it fills the crack near the well , it then acts as a filter to stop sand going back further into the slot .
So now we change the chemistry of the water by adding what are usually known as long - chain polymers .
These chemicals thicken the water so that it will ( at relatively low chemical percentages ) suspend the sand in the fluid .
Because these molecules are also slippery ( in another variety they are added to the water in crowd control water cannons to produce what is known as Banana Water – since it makes the street too slippery to stand on ) they also reduce the friction between the fluid flow and the walls of the crack , and this also helps carry the sand further back into the crack , and gives the slickwater title to the hydrofrac .
The third snag is a bit more technical .
You remember that earlier on I talked about the pressure about the hole causing the sides of the horizontal well to crush .
Well , at the top and bottom of the well instead of the rock seeing this additional crushing pressure , the shifting of the vertical load to the walls of the hole , can mean that the rock will go into tension , where it is much weaker .
As a result cracks can appear in the top and bottom of the horizontal hole .
Why is this a problem ?
Because the easy way to cause a fracture to grow is to fill the well with liquid and increase the pressure of the liquid until the rock breaks .
( Hence hydraulic fracture or hydrofrac . )
But if there is a crack there already then just increasing the pressure in the hole causes that crack to grow and it may not be in the direction we want .
And so it is time to call in the engineers ( who also do n’t come cheap ) to do the interesting things that cause the crack to grow in the right direction .
The benefits to all this for the Marcellus has been described by Engelder .
" Conservatively , we generally only consider 10 percent of gas in place as a potential resource , " said Engelder .
" The key , of course , is that the Marcellus is more easily produced by horizontal drilling across fractures , and until recently , gas production companies seemed unaware of the presence of the natural fractures necessary for magnifying the success of horizontal drilling in the Marcellus . "
The U.S. currently produces roughly 30 trillion cubic feet of gas a year , and these numbers are dropping .
According to Engelder , the technology exists to recover 50 trillion cubic feet of gas from the Marcellus , thus keeping the U.S. production up .
If this recovery is realized , the Marcellus reservoir would be considered a Super Giant gas field .
. . . .
These fractures , referred to as J1 fractures by Engelder and Lash , run as slices from the northeast to the southwest in the Marcellus shale and are fairly close together .
While a vertical well may cross one of these fractures and other less productive fractures , a horizontally drilled well aimed to the north northwest will cross a series of very productive J1 fractures .
The article illustrates that concept with a representation of the horizontal well drilled perpendicular to the joints at an outcrop .

The upfront money may give some pause to prospectors .
A typical well that drills straight down to a depth of about 2,000 to 3,000 feet costs roughly $ 800,000 .
But in the Marcellus Shale , Range and other companies hope a different kind of drilling might yield better results — one in which a well is dug straight down to depths of about 6,000 feet or more , before making a right angle to drill horizontally into the shale .
That kind of well could cost a company $ 3 million to build , not counting the cost of leasing the land , Engelder said .
The company , in a December financial report , estimated that two horizontal wells are producing roughly 4.6 million cubic feet of gas per day .
Tests on an additional three recently completed horizontal wells showed potential for a total of 12.7 million cubic feet of gas per day .
Industry experts call those results promising .
The benefits have also been projected here .
And while they may be considerable , it is only after the wells are in production , and not only initial flows , but also well lifetimes are established , that the true benefit will become apparent .
But until some solid , repeatable well data emerges , the Haynesville will remain more diamond in the rough than diamond ring .
As BMO Capital Markets analyst Dan McSpirit rightly noted in a report last week : " The proof ( of Haynesville economics ) is in how the wells get drilled and the rates of return such operations yield . "
He added , " These are early innings .
Lasting value creation should be revealed later in the game . "
The costs and estimates of production came from the time that the original post on this topic was written , and costs ( as you may have noted from the comments and from other references I have made ) can now get as high as $ 8 million for a horizontal well .
But I will come back and write more about penetrations and hydraulic fracture in the next post .
OTTAWA - The Canadian dollar appears to be again reaching for parity .
With the greenback falling against most global currencies , the loonie has caught an updraft that has seen it gain about three cents in just over a week , to approach 95 cents US .
And many factors - including an expected positive jobs report from Statistics Canada on Friday - are expected to help keep the loonie rising , possibly to parity by the end of the year .
The consensus is for the agency to report that 5,000 net jobs were created in September .
That is a modest number , but marks a major difference from the situation in the U.S. - against whose the currency the loonie is measured .
It would represent the second monthly employment gain in Canada and a clear indication the country is bouncing back from recession , whereas the U.S. still reporting massive three - digit monthly job losses .
In fact , the U.S. has n't had a positive reading in almost two years .
As well , the Australian central bank 's decision this week to raise interest rates is leading to speculation that the Bank of Canada will be the next to move , regardless of governor Mark Carney 's " conditional commitment " to keep the policy rate at an ultra- low 0.25 per cent until mid-2010 .
Carney did n't do anything to dissuade the speculation with his latest speech , in which he devoted three paragraphs to reminding listeners that the commitment was conditional , stressing that the pledge was " an expectation , not a promise . "
The loonie is also benefiting from a general mood of optimism about the global economy that is pushing commodity prices and demand higher , particularly for oil .
" The market has a renewed risk appetite , very similar to what we saw through the early part of 2007 , " when the loonie went beyond parity , said Shane Enright , a currency strategist with CIBC .
Bank of Montreal economist Douglas Porter said his bank 's official forecast remains for the loonie to achieve " sustainable parity " by the middle of next year , but it now believes the magic number could occur in the next few months .
He pointed out that currency markets often overshoot fundamentals both on the upside and downside , and that the wind is clearly behind the loonie .
" Once markets focus on a target , they sometimes act like a dog with a bone , " he said .
But Porter added that the speculation about the Bank of Canada following Australia into a tightening mode makes little sense , given that the central bank has expressed concern about the dollar 's quick appreciation .
Higher interest rates will only serve to give the currency an additional boost , he noted .

Microsoft asks that the lower court 's rejection of Bilski 's patent be upheld , but they also believe the " machine - or - transformation " test the lower court set forth should be disapproved .
Instead , they think the standard should be " new and useful " :
While electronic computers have become ubiquitous and almost infinitely varied in form and function , virtually all of them rely for their operation on the same physical activity -- the routing and rerouting of electrical signals by means of on - off switches such as transistors .
A " hardware " device , such as a laptop computer , contains millions of tiny transistor switches ; " software " is the set of instructions that determines the configuration of and directs electrical signals through these switches so that the device will do something useful .
While both hardware and software have become increasingly complex , the underlying activity -- the sequential operation of switches - - has been the basis of patent - eligible processes since at least the Industrial Revolution .
II .
Although the Court should be chary of " lin[ king ] patent eligibility to the age of iron and steel at a time of subatomic particles and terabytes " ( Pet. App. 134a ( Rader , J. , dissenting ) ) , we respectfully submit that the eligibility framework that this Court developed during the Industrial Revolution -- an era of tremendous advances in electronic and communications technology -- retains its vitality , and relevance , today .
While modern digital and computer technologies are vastly more complex and efficient than their precursors , they are built upon the same physical activity as Industrial Age analogues such as Morse 's telegraph and Bell 's telephone .
Interpreting the same constitutional and statutory language that controls today , the Nineteenth Century precedents established that a patent - eligible process must involve one or more disclosed physical things -- that is , it must describe a series of steps that use physical means to produce a result or effect in the physical world .
Ah , but what do they mean by " physical " ?
They do n't mean physical as in cotton gins .
They mean things like electromagnetic signals and electric current .
They define " physical " like this : " Physical " means anything discernible or measurable , including ( for example ) electromagnetic signals propagated through the air , electric current transmitted by wire , electrostatic or magnetic charges on appropriate media , or photonic impulses through a fiber optic cable .
So if you can discern it or measure it , it 's " physical " .
So what is a computer , after all , Microsoft asks ?
How do they work ?
The fantastic variety in which computers are now found can obscure the remarkable fact that every single one is , at its heart , a collection of tiny on - off switches -- usually in the form of transistors .
Why that 's pretty much the same as gears and switches , as in Charles Babbage 's machine : Just as the configuration of gears and shafts determined the functionality of Babbage 's computers , it is the careful configuration of these on - off switches that produces the complex and varied functionality of modern computers ....
Today , these on - off switches are usually found in pre-designed packages of transistors commonly known as " chips . "
Thin wafers of silicon , chips can contain many millions of transistors , connected to one another by conductive materials etched onto the chip like a web of telephone lines .
They are organ - ized such that they can be turned on or off in pat - terned fashion , and by this method , perform simple operations , such as turning on every transistor whose corresponding transistor is off in the neighboring group .
From these building blocks , mathematical and logical operations are carried out .
Patterson & Hennessy , supra , at 44 - 47 & App. C. The challenge for the inventor is how to use these transistors ( and applying the principles of logic , physics , electromagnetism , photonics , etc. ) in a way that produces the desired functionality in a useful manner .
Computer programming is an exercise in reductionism , as every feature , decision , and analysis must be broken down to the level of the rudimentary operations captured by transistors turning on and off .
This reductionism is matched by the detail with which transistors must be configured and instructed to carry out the thousands or millions of operations required by the process .
No difference , really , Microsoft argues , except things are a lot faster now .
And after all , in Microsoft Corp. v. AT&T Corp. , the ruling found that " Windows software renders a general - purpose computer " capable of performing as the patented speech processor " .
See ?
Patentable !
Today , computer languages plus semiconductor chips replicate what human operators used to do on ENIAC , they continue : Using these languages , the inventor can create " software " that defines the operations of semiconductor chips and other hardware .
These operations are the steps of a computer - implemented process .
The role of software is simply to automate the reconfiguration of the electronic pathways that was once done manually by the human operators of ENIAC .
As with any patentable process , it is the real - world implementation -- the actual acting out , or physical execution -- of the process that makes it new and useful .
In a computer - implemented process , the acting out consists primarily of the rapid activation and deactivation of millions of transistors to perform some useful function , such as displaying images and solving problems .
Such functions , implemented and made real , physical , and useful by the activity of transistors , are the inventor 's actual process .
Ah , but could you patent what the human operators of ENIAC did ?
They manually manipulated the cables and switches , Microsoft says on page 11 , a task taken over by software today .
That 's a serious question .
Could you patent the human activity of manipulating the cables and switches ?
( See xkcd 's bunch of rocks computer cartoon . )
Microsoft 's conclusion :
While the popular conception of " software " as something that is functionally distinct from " hardware " can be useful , it tends to obscure our understanding of the physical processes taking place within the computers all around us .
This is reflected in the commonly used term " software patent , " employed by petitioners .
So - called " software patents " generally do not actually describe software at all , but rather the process performed by a programmed computer .
It is such a computer - implemented process -- not software itself -- that is potentially eligible for patent protection .
So software is a process that humans used to do , but a lot faster ?
Is n't this essentially the same argument we already heard from Lee Hollaar ?
Patent the computer - implemented process , Microsoft argues :
The role of software is simply to automate the reconfiguration of the electronic pathways that was once done manually by the human operators of ENIAC ....
Purporting to analyze the patent - eligibility of software , as opposed to that of hardware , relies on an illusory distinction .
The functionality of any digital device is the product of the same transistor activity , and it is the configuration of the pathways between those transistors that dictates their functionality .
Like all patent - eligible processes , computer - implemented processes combine physical activity with human - directed logic .
Irrespective of whether a particular configuration of transistors is accomplished using a soldering iron or by means of software , the processes conducted by these transistors are ultimately physical processes .
Uh huh .
So , can we patent a human soldering something ?
Is n't that what software is in this analogy ?
Plus they do n't address the fundamental issue : if software is math , and it is , it should not be patentable , no matter what it does .
Wait .
At the very end , they indeed address that sort of , like this :
These cases teach that physical implementation of a principle in a useful manner addresses ( and , in most if not all cases , resolves ) the prohibition against patenting principles , which inheres in Section 101 .
The added complexity of the court of appeals machine - or - transformation  formulation does not improve on this Courts clearer understanding : a process that makes use of a disclosed physical thing , and produces a measurable result in the physical world , does something more than describe an unpatentable principle it is an application of that principle .
To be patent - eligible , therefore , a claimed method must involve one or more disclosed physical things that is , it must describe a series of steps that use physical means to produce a result or effect in the physical world .
So , you can use this workaround to let software be patentable even if it is math , because you do n't patent the math ; you patent the process that uses it in a new and useful way .
Sigh .
Microsoft spent a lot of money on patents .
They want their money 's worth .
Still , this analogy to older methods of doing the same things , as they describe them , could take root in a judge 's mind , particularly if he does n't know what software actually is .
They might reason that if you could patent a telegraph machine , why not the computer equivalent .
They might not realize that while they can do the same thing -- send messages -- how they do it is quite different .
And no one let you patent electricity , even though it was a necessary piece of the process .
If you patent processes , you 'd have to patent the electrical current too .
That 's if I understood the brief , and since my lip was curled as I read it , it 's possible I have missed something .
If so , no doubt you will notice and clarify .
Here 's the Microsoft brief , as text , then , so you can analyze it for yourself : ***********************************

AND SYMANTEC CORPORATION AS AMICI
CURIAE IN SUPPORT OF RESPONDENTS _____________________
Microsoft Corporation , Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V. , and Symantec Corporation , as amici curiae , respectfully submit that the judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed .
1 INTEREST OF AMICI CURIAE Microsoft 's mission is to enable individuals and businesses throughout the world to realize their full potential by creating technology that transforms the way people work , play , and communicate .
Microsoft develops , manufactures , licenses , and supports a wide range of software programs and services for many different types of computing devices , including the flagship Windows operating system and the Office suite of productivity applications .
Koninklijke Philips Electronics N.V. ( aka Royal Philips Electronics N.V. ) is the parent corporation of a worldwide family of companies ( " Philips " ) .
Philips has been inventing and manufacturing electronic and electrical products for over 115 years and is one of the largest users of the patent system in the 2 United States .
Philips began operation as a Nineteenth Century electric lamp manufacturer and its history is rooted in the classic patent battles of the industrial age .
Scientists and engineers at Philips ' American laboratories have made pioneering advances in the fields of medical diagnosis and imaging , high definition television , optical CD and DVD recording , and digital rights management .
Symantec is a global leader in providing security , storage , and systems management solutions to help its customers -- from consumers and small businesses to the largest global organizations -- secure and manage their information against risk .
Symantec operates in more than 40 countries , and maintains research and development facilities , 24x7 Security Operations Centers , and Security Response Labs around the world .
The company holds more than 700 patents in its global patent portfolio , addressing security , systems management , and storage needs for consumers , small business and enterprises .
Individually and collectively , amici hold a large number of patents , including patents that claim computer - implemented methods , and they are also frequently sued for infringement by others who hold such patents .
Amici thus have a profound interest in the patent - eligibility of process patents in general and computer - implemented process claims in particular , as part of their substantial stake in the efficient and fair functioning of the patent system as a whole .
SUMMARY OF ARGUMENT
Because principles are not patentable , petitioners ' claimed method of hedging commodities transactions is not patent - eligible and the judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed , although its ex- 3 clusive reliance on the " machine - or - transformation " test should be disapproved .
That test , as articulated by the Federal Circuit , is not consistent with this Court 's cases , and it is already proving unwieldy and confusing to implement .
Contrary to the suggestions of petitioners and others , however , affirming the rejection of the application in issue need not -- and , under the appropriate standard of patent - eligibility , would not -- imperil properly drawn claims describing computer - implemented processes .
I. Some have expressed concern that affirming the rejection of petitioners ' application would " exclude [ ] forms of information - based and software - implemented inventions arising from new technological capabilities . "
Pet. App. 64a ( Newman , J. , dissenting ) .
Dispelling that concern requires a basic understanding of how computer - implemented processes work in the real world .
While electronic computers have become ubiquitous and almost infinitely varied in form and function , virtually all of them rely for their operation on the same physical activity -- the routing and rerouting of electrical signals by means of on - off switches such as transistors .
A " hardware " device , such as a laptop computer , contains millions of tiny transistor switches ; " software " is the set of instructions that determines the configuration of and directs electrical signals through these switches so that the device will do something useful .
While both hardware and software have become increasingly complex , the underlying activity -- the sequential operation of switches -- has been the basis of patent - eligible processes since at least the Industrial Revolu- tion .
II .
Although the Court should be chary of " lin[ king ] patent eligibility to the age of iron and 4 steel at a time of subatomic particles and terabytes " ( Pet. App. 134a ( Rader , J. , dissenting ) ) , we respectfully submit that the eligibility framework that this Court developed during the Industrial Revolution -- an era of tremendous advances in electronic and communications technology -- retains its vitality , and relevance , today .
While modern digital and computer technologies are vastly more complex and efficient than their precursors , they are built upon the same physical activity as Industrial Age analogues such as Morse 's telegraph and Bell 's telephone .
Interpreting the same constitutional and statutory language that controls today , the Nineteenth Century precedents established that a patent - eligible process must involve one or more disclosed physical things -- that is , it must describe a series of steps that use physical means to produce a result or effect in the physical world .
See , e.g. , Tilghman v. Proctor , 102 U.S. 707 , 727 ( 1881 )
( " Whoever discovers that a certain useful result will be produced , in any art [ i.e. , process ] ... , by the use of certain means , is entitled to a patent for it " ) ( emphasis added ) .
This standard is fatal to petitioners ' application , but should not imperil the patent - eligibility of properly drawn claims describing computer - implemented processes .
ARGUMENT
Everyone agrees that " a principle is not patentable . "
Le Roy v. Tatham , 55 U.S. 156 , 174-75 ( 1853 ) .
Petitioners ' patent application , which claims a method of hedging commodities transactions , runs smack into this unchallenged prohibition .
See U.S. Br. 53 - 54 ; see also Yahoo Br. 34-35 ; Business Software Alliance Br. 16 -18 .
Indeed , not one of the seventeen amicus briefs filed in support of petitioners offers a credible defense of the actual application at 5 issue in this case .
The judgment of the court of appeals , affirming the rejection of petitioners ' application , should be affirmed -- although , as explained below , its adoption of the " machine - or - transformation " rubric as the exclusive test for patent - eligibility should be disapproved .
Contrary to the suggestions of petitioners and others , affirming the rejection of the application in issue need not , and under the appropriate standard would not , imperil the patent - eligibility of properly drawn claims describing computer - implemented processes .
To demonstrate this , we first outline the practical and technological contours of computer - related inventions , and then explain how the patent - eligibility of such inventions can comfortably be resolved within the traditional eligibility framework developed by this Court in response to great advances in electronic and communication technologies during the Nineteenth Century .
Under that framework , a patentable process must involve one or more disclosed physical things -- that is , it must describe a series of steps that use physical means to produce a result or effect in the physical world .
2 6 I. From The Twenty - First Century To The
Nineteenth : Innovation Through The
Sequential Operation Of Switches Some knowledgeable observers of our patent system have expressed concern that affirming the rejection of petitioners ' application , particularly under the " machine - or - transformation " framework adopted as exclusive by the Federal Circuit majority , could " exclude [ ] forms of information - based and software - implemented inventions arising from new technological capabilities . "
Pet. App. 64a ( Newman , J. , dissenting ) ; see also Dolby Br. 10 ; IBM Br. 17-19 ; Medtronic Br. 5 - 11 .
Petitioners previously echoed this concern , arguing in their petition that " the Federal Circuit 's decision threatens many of the nation 's fundamental industries , including software " because it " casts doubt " on " tens of thousands of software patents , " leaving them " vulnerable to attack . "
Pet. 30 . Petitioners ' merits brief , which concedes that the method claimed in their application " does not necessarily have to be performed on a particular machine or computer " ( Pet. Br. 7 ) , fails to make good on this threat ; indeed , " software " makes only a brief and non-substantive appearance .
See Pet. Br. 40 .
As the Solicitor General explains , " this case does not present any question as to the application of the machine - or - transformation test to software or yet more novel future forms of industrial or technological processes . "
U.S. Br. 37 .
Nevertheless , since the patent - eligibility of computer - implemented processes could obviously be impacted by the Court 's resolution of this dispute , this Court should be mindful of this potential impact in articulating any general standard or test for patent eligibility .
7 Clearly , specific interpretations of the test articulated below have proven problematic .
See , e.g. , Yahoo Br. 9 - 13 ; Borland Br. 19-28 ; AIPPI Br. 28 -32 ; Awaken IP Br. 13-23 ; Entrepreneurial Software Companies Br. 16 - 22 .
Although the judgment of the court of appeals is correct , the majority erred in opining that the non-statutory " machine - or - transformation " test is the exclusive measure of patent - eligibility .
That test has proven overly difficult to implement in practice .
See Yahoo Br. 9 -17 ; Dolby Br. 10 - 11 ; Regulatory Datacorp Br. 23 -26 .
Moreover , even when that test is useful , it is descriptive rather than prescriptive :
A process that meets the test is likely to be patent - eligible , but the test itself is not a prerequisite to patentability .
As explained further below , the eligibility standard that has traditionally been applied by this Court requires that a patent - eligible process must involve one or more disclosed physical things -- that is , it must describe a series of steps that use physical means to produce a result or effect in the physical world .
The inventor must disclose an embodiment of a process that is susceptible to practical application using physical means and disclose those physical means with sufficient particularity to enable others to use the invention .
But no particular " machine " is required .
Cochrane v. Deener , 94 U.S. 780 , 787-88 ( 1876 ) ( " A process is a mode of treatment of certain materials to produce a given result .
. . .
[ B ]ut the tools to be used in doing this may be of secondary consequence . " ) .
In this respect , the error in the majority opinion lies not in its conclusion that the claims in petitioners ' application are not patentable ( they are not ) , but in its annunciation of the machine - or - transformation test as the alpha - and - omega of patent - eligibility .
Cf. KSR Int'l Co. v. Teleflex Inc. , 8 550 U.S. 398 , 418 ( 2007 ) ( " Helpful insights ... need not become rigid and mandatory formulas " ) .
3
Computer - implemented inventions are fundamentally and easily distinguishable from the hedging method claimed in petitioners ' application using the patent - eligibility framework developed by this Court in precedents dating to the Nineteenth Century .
To demonstrate that this Court 's Industrial Age precedents are both appropriate and easily applicable to these modern technologies requires a brief discussion of the underlying architecture of digital machines and the real - world implementation of computer processes .
Despite the popular conception of the computer as a quintessentially modern technology , computers predate inventions such as the telephone and tele - 9 graph , and date back to the age of steam power and brass gears .
Charles Babbage 's mechanical computers -- the Difference Engine and the Analytical Engine -- designed in the Nineteenth Century , were the forerunners of modern computing devices .
Anthony Hyman , Charles Babbage : Pioneer of the Computer 164-66 ( 1982 ) ( by 1836 , Babbage " had sketched out many of the salient features of the modern computer " ) .
Obviously , there have been enormous advances since the days of Babbage , with mechanical gears giving way initially to electromechanical relays and vacuum tubes , and more recently to semiconductor chips .
Today , the term " computer " often denotes the laptop or desktop device that many people use for word processing , e-mail , surfing the Internet , and other applications .
While this usage of the term is of course correct , it captures only a little slice of the broad spectrum of computers in common use today .
At the high - end , corporations , governments , and educational institutions employ supercomputers -- either huge custom - built devices or specialized networks of smaller machines -- to perform calculations of a complexity , and at a speed , nearly incomprehensible to the layperson .
And at the low - end , small computers are built into ( or comprise ) a vast array of consumer devices , including digital televisions , cellular telephones , music players and other entertainment devices , videogame consoles , kitchen appliances , thermostats , and so forth .
A current - generation automobile includes several computers , which control everything from the fuel - injection system to the antilock brakes ; a modern " fly - by - wire " airplane is a highly sophisticated computing system ; and the means of controlling traffic , both on land and in the air , depend on complicated computer networks .
The 10 list could go on and on .
See IBM Br. 7 , 19 -21 ( providing numerous examples of the expanding and essential contributions of computers ) .
The fantastic variety in which computers are now found can obscure the remarkable fact that every single one is , at its heart , a collection of tiny on - off switches -- usually in the form of transistors .
See generally David A. Patterson & John L. Hennessy , Computer Organization and Design ( 4th ed. 2009 ) ; Ron White , How Computers Work ( 8th ed. 2005 ) .
Just as the configuration of gears and shafts determined the functionality of Babbage 's computers , it is the careful configuration of these on - off switches that produces the complex and varied functionality of modern computers .
Today , these on - off switches are usually found in pre-designed packages of transistors commonly known as " chips . "
Thin wafers of silicon , chips can contain many millions of transistors , connected to one another by conductive materials etched onto the chip like a web of telephone lines .
They are organized such that they can be turned on or off in patterned fashion , and by this method , perform simple operations , such as turning on every transistor whose corresponding transistor is off in the neighboring group .
From these building blocks , mathematical and logical operations are carried out .
Patterson & Hennessy , supra , at 44 - 47 & App. C. The challenge for the inventor is how to use these transistors ( and applying the principles of logic , physics , electromagnetism , photonics , etc. ) in a way that produces the desired functionality in a useful manner .
Computer programming is an exercise in reductionism , as every feature , decision , and analysis must be broken down to the level of the ru- 11 dimentary operations captured by transistors turning on and off .
This reductionism is matched by the detail with which transistors must be configured and instructed to carry out the thousands or millions of operations required by the process .
Early electronic computers were " programmed " by laboriously rewiring their electrical pathways so that the computer would perform a desired function .
ENIAC -- the first general - purpose electronic digital computer , functioning at the mid-point of the Twentieth Century -- could take days to program , with operators physically manipulating the switches and cables .
Patterson & Hennessy , supra , at 1.10 .
[ ed : graphic of ENIAC ]
Fortunately , this is no longer the case .
Transistors , packaged onto silicon chips , permit electronic manipulation of the pathways between them , allowing those pathways to be altered to implement different processes without direct physical manipulation .
The instructions for this electronic reconfiguration are typically expressed in computer software .
See Microsoft Corp. v. AT&T Corp. , 550 U.S. 437 , 445-46 ( 2007 ) ( noting that , inter alia , Windows software renders a general - purpose computer " capable of performing as the patented speech processor " ) .
To allow more sophisticated control over the millions of transistors on a chip , inventors rely on a multi- layered scheme of pre-designed software " lan- 12 guages " that help bridge the gap between the on - off language of the transistor and the words and gram - mar of human understanding .
These allow control of the transistors on a chip at various levels of specificity , ranging from " machine language , " which allows transistor - level control , to " programming languages , " which allow operations to be defined through formal syntax and semantics that are more easily understood by humans .
Each language pre-packages the mathematical and logical operations that are most useful for the users of that particular language .
See Patterson & Hennessy , supra , at 11 - 13 , 20 - 21 , 76-80 .
Using these languages , the inventor can create " software " that defines the operations of semiconductor chips and other hardware .
These operations are the steps of a computer - implemented process .
The role of software is simply to automate the reconfiguration of the electronic pathways that was once done manually by the human operators of ENIAC .
4
As with any patentable process , it is the real - world implementation -- the actual acting out , or physical execution -- of the process that makes it new and useful .
In a computer - implemented process , the acting out consists primarily of the rapid activation and deactivation of millions of transistors to perform 13 some useful function , such as displaying images and solving problems .
Such functions , implemented and made real , physical , and useful by the activity of transistors , are the inventor 's actual process .
While the popular conception of " software " as something that is functionally distinct from " hardware " can be useful , it tends to obscure our understanding of the physical processes taking place within the computers all around us .
This is reflected in the commonly used term " software patent , " employed by petitioners .
So - called " software patents " generally do not actually describe software at all , but rather the process performed by a programmed computer .
It is such a computer - implemented process -- not software itself -- that is potentially eligible for patent protection .
See generally Examination Guidelines for Computer - Related Inventions , 61 Fed. Reg. 7,478 ( Feb. 28 , 1996 ) .
For this reason , the notion of " software patents " as a category that is distinct from digital hardware patents lacks any coherent technological or legal basis .
Purporting to analyze the patent - eligibility of software , as opposed to that of hardware , relies on an illusory distinction .
The functionality of any digital device is the product of the same transistor activity , and it is the configuration of the pathways between those transistors that dictates their functionality .
Like all patent - eligible processes , computer - implemented processes combine physical activity with human - directed logic .
Irrespective of whether a particular configuration of transistors is accomplished using a soldering iron or by means of software , the processes conducted by these transistors are ultimately physical processes .
Cf. Quanta Computer Inc. v. LG Elecs. , Inc. , 128 S. Ct. 2109 , 2118 ( 2008 ) .

It follows naturally from this understanding that the innovation that employs a computer to do new and useful things is not necessarily encompassed by the innovations of the transistor ( or computer ) itself -- that is , a new way to use an existing computer may itself be patent - eligible .
See 35 U.S.C. § 100 ( b ) ( " The term ' process ' ... includes a new use of a known process , machine , manufacture , composition of matter , or material " ) .
Although the court below dismissed this statutory text as " unhelpful " ( Pet. App. 7a n.3 ) , it confirms that , among other things , each new application of computer technology ( at heart , each new use of transistors ) which permits computers to perform a useful function is the product of human innovation , the application of principles to the functions of human needs .
In this respect , modern computer - related inventions are no different from other patent - eligible innovations that have produced a new and useful result by employing physical structures and phenomena to record , manipulate , or disseminate information .
Perhaps the most celebrated example of such technological innovation is Samuel Morse 's invention of the electric telegraph , which ( like modern computers ) employed binary encoding in conjunction with the sequential operation of switches .
[ ed : graphic of telegraph operator sending a message ]
Although petitioners focus almost exclusively on the Court 's rejection of his eighth claim ( on which more below ) , the 15 Court allowed a number of other claims , including the fifth .
O'Reilly v. Morse , 56 U.S. 62 , 112 ( 1854 ) .
That claim was for " the system of signs , consisting of dots and spaces , and of dots , spaces and horizontal lines . "
Id. at 86 .
This system , an early version of Morse Code , was nothing other than a system for manipulating an on - off switch -- the telegraph key -- in a prescribed manner to produce the useful result of intelligible communications between two parties .
Indeed , although much less complex , the telegraph system -- a web of interconnected switches spreading around the globe , enabling binary - encoded communication - - was comparable to the modern Internet .
The Industrial Age also knew software and hardware in a literal sense ; the core concepts in computer design and programming were developed in this period .
The principle of encoded instructions controlling a device found application at the opening of the Nineteenth Century , with the famous Jacquard loom , a device ( still in use today ) that adjusts the warp and weft of a textile in response to " programming " contained on punch cards .
The loom 's control apparatus consists of a series of on - off switches which are controlled by the pattern of holes punched in the cards , just as the pattern of microscopic pits and lands on the surface of a CD can be used to control the transistor switches inside a computer .
Hyman , supra , at 166 ; Patterson & Hennessy , supra , at 24 .
Inventors soon seized on the " programming " principle applied in the Jacquard loom .
A defining characteristic of Babbage 's Analytical Engine , for example , was the use of punch cards , adopted from the Jacquard loom , to store the programs run by the machine .
" Following the introduction of punched 16 cards early in 1836 four functional units familiar in the modern computer could soon be clearly distinguished : input / output system , mill , store , and control . "
Hyman , supra , at 166 .
Babbage 's close friend , Ada Lovelace ( the daughter of Lord Byron ) , is now recognized as " the first computer programmer " for her work developing software programs for the Analytical Engine .
Nell Dale et al. , Programming and Problem Solving with C++ 406-407 ( 1997 ) .
Later in the Nineteenth Century , Herman Hollerith , a U.S. Census Office employee , developed a means of tabulating census results using punch cards and mechanical calculation .
His method allowed the country to complete the 1890 census two years sooner and for five million dollars less than manual tabulation .
William R. Aul , " Herman Hollerith : Data Processing Pioneer , " Think 22 - 23 ( Nov. 1972 ) .
The company he founded became the International Business Machines Corp. , and the once - prevalent IBM punch - cards were both the direct descendent of the means used to program a Jacquard loom and the immediate predecessor to today 's CDs and other media , which contain digitized instructions 17 for modern computers to open and close millions of switches .
As has been often noted by historians of technological development , our perceptions of innovation and modernity are often misguided -- the roots of technological change are deep , and run farther back in our history than we perceive .
See Brian Winston , Media Technology & Society : A History 1 ( 1998 ) ( arguing that current innovations in communications technology are " hyperbolised as a revolutionary train of events [ but ] can be seen as a far more evolutionary and less transforming process " ) .
That is certainly true with respect to computer - related inventions .
While the hardware and software implemented by a modern e-mail program may be orders of magnitude more complex than the dot - dash - dot of a telegraph key , the underlying physical activity that makes communication possible -- the sequential operation of switches -- is fundamentally the same .

From The Nineteenth Century To The
Twenty - First : Processes That Involve
Disclosed Physical Things Are Patent -
Eligible
In a series of cases decided over the course of the Industrial Revolution , this Court gave content to the prohibition against patenting principles by allowing the patentability only of methods that involve disclosed physical things .
Although we agree that that the Court should be hesitant to " link [ ] patent eligibility to the age of iron and steel at a time of sub-atomic particles and terabytes " ( Pet. App. 134a ( Rader , J. , dissenting ) ) , we submit that those historical precedents retain their vitality , and relevance , today .
Indeed , the doctrines laid down by the Court in the Nineteenth Century can resolve most if not all 18 modern questions of patent - eligibility , including those involving computer - implemented process claims .
5
The Court originally framed the core proscription thusly : " A principle , in the abstract , is a fundamental truth ; an original cause ; a motive ; these cannot be patented , as no one can claim in either of them an exclusive right . "
Le Roy , 55 U.S. at 174-75 .
In the intervening century - and - a - half , the Court has articulated the proposition in varying ways , but the song remains the same : Such ephemera are " free to all men and reserved exclusively to none . "
Funk Bros. Seed Co. v. Kalo Inoculant Co. , 333 U.S. 127 , 130 ( 1948 ) .
This prohibition against the patentability of principles is rooted in the plain text of the Patent Act , which ( as pertinent here ) authorizes patents only for inventions that are both " new " and " useful . "
35 U.S.C. § 101 ( " Whoever invents or discovers any new and useful process , machine , manufacture , or composition of matter , or any new and useful improvement thereof , may obtain a patent therefor , subject to the 19 conditions and requirements of this title " ) ( emphasis added ) .
6
Absent their novel application in the real world , principles are not " new " inventions .
They , " like the heat of the sun , electricity , or the qualities of metals , are part of the storehouse of knowledge of all men ....
He who discovers a hitherto unknown phenomenon of nature has no claim to a monopoly of it which the law recognizes . "
Funk Bros. , 333 U.S. at 130 .
This inventiveness element is distinct from ( and a prerequisite to ) the novelty requirement imposed by Section 102 , which is concerned with who first disclosed an invention that is otherwise patent - eligible .
20 Disembodied principles in themselves also are not " useful " in the sense of Section 101 .
The basic quid pro quo contemplated by the Constitution and the Congress for granting a patent monopoly is the benefit derived by the public from an invention with substantial utility .
Unless and until a process is refined and developed to this point -- where specific benefit exists in currently available form -- there is insufficient justification for permitting an applicant to engross what may prove to be a broad field .
Brenner v. Manson , 383 U.S. 519 , 534 ( 1966 ) .
Like the inventiveness element , the prerequisite of usefulness is separate from , and precedes , the " use " requirement imposed by Section 112 ( first paragraph ) , which is concerned with the adequacy of disclosure of an invention that is otherwise patent - eligible .
This prohibition on patenting principles is of constitutional dimension .
" Congress may not authorize the issuance of patents whose effects are to remove existent knowledge from the public domain , or to restrict free access to materials already available . "
Graham v. John Deere Co. , 383 U.S. 1 , 6 ( 1966 ) .
Such a patent would not " promote the Progress of ... useful Arts . "
Art. I , § 8 , cl. 8 ; see also Lab Corp. of Am. Holdings v. Metabolite Labs. , Inc. , 548 U.S. 124 , 126-27 ( 2006 ) ( Breyer , J. , dissenting from dismissal of certiorari ) .
Physical things ( devices , engines , etc. ) often depend on principles , such as the laws of physics and thermodynamics , for their successful or efficient operation ; but they are embodiments or instantiations of such principles rather than the principles them - 21 selves .
See , e.g. , Eibel Process Co. v. Minnesota & Ontario Paper Co. , 261 U.S. 45 ( 1923 ) ( patented paper - making machine applied the principle of gravity to improve efficiency ) .
In contrast , a process ( or method ) claims a series of steps for doing something , rather than the thing itself .
Such a claim may well be patent - eligible ( see , e.g. , Cochrane , 94 U.S. 780 at 787 ) , but requires scrutiny to ensure that what is claimed is not merely an unpatentable abstract principle .
7
The statutory and constitutional bases of patent - eligibility have been in place since the Founding .
See Graham , 383 U.S. at 5 - 12 .
To be sure , Congress has enacted intellectual - property legislation in response to specific technological advances .
See , e.g. , Plant Variety Protection Act of 1970 , 7 U.S.C. §§ 2321-2582 .
But the Patent Act does not differentiate among the useful arts , and it certainly does not single out computer - related inventions for special treatment .
Accordingly , the continued relevance of these basic precepts to patents claiming technologi- 22 cal advances is best understood by reference to an earlier period of transformational innovation .
At the dawn of the Industrial Age , this Court recognized both the patentability of processes and the challenge of distinguishing unpatentable " principles " from patent - eligible processes in a celebrated series of cases arising from that era's remarkable innovations in communication technology .
While the telegraph and wire - line telephone may seem commonplace , even archaic , in the light of modern computer and telecommunications innovations , the parallels , and continuity , between these historical innovations and those of our own age should not be underestimated .
Nineteenth Century assessments certainly had a familiar ring of hyperbole .
See , e.g. , Edward Highton , The Electric Telegraph : Its History and Progress 1 - 2 ( 1852 ) ( " What an age of wonders is this !
When one considers the state of Science a century ago , and compares the light of the past with that of the present day -- how great is the change !
how marvellous the advance ! . . .
Few inventions have created so great surprise and delight as that of the Electric Telegraph . " ) ; id. at 178 ( " Time and space are all but annihilated .
Years are converted into days , days into seconds , and miles have become mere fractions of an inch . " ) .
And modern scholars have often recognized the similarity , and continuity , between these Nineteenth Century innovations and those of the modern era .
See , e.g. , Daniel Walker Howe , What Hath God Wrought : The Transformation of America , 1815 - 1848 1 -2 ( 2007 ) ( arguing that the telegraph " was destined to change the world , " and that , together with the railroad , its " consequences certainly rivaled , and probably exceeded 23 in importance , those of the revolutionary ' information highway ' of our own lifetimes " ) .
And , notably , the contemporaneous observations of this Court demonstrate that while inventions are always new , invention itself decidedly is not .
The electric telegraph marks an epoch in the progress of time .
In a little more than a quarter of a century it has changed the habits of business , and become one of the necessities of commerce .
It is indispensable as a means of inter-communication , but especially is it so in commercial transactions .
Pensacola Tel. Co. v. W. Union Tel. Co. , 96 U.S. 1 , 9-10 ( 1877 ) .
Today , " the Internet " could be substituted for " electric telegraph " and the Court 's observations hold true in the Twenty - First Century .
Asked during this prior period of technological change to resolve the patent - eligibility of its pivotal inventions , this Court relied upon and refined the bedrock notion that principles are not patentable , but their useful applications may be .
And it found that physical implementation -- the use of disclosed physical means -- defined the line separating principle from a practical application .
In one of the most famous cases defining this distinction between an unpatentable " principle " and a patent - eligible process , the Court limited its approval of Samuel Morse 's patent to the physical method he had developed for telegraphy , described in the fifth claim and elsewhere , and excluded the underlying principle ( as described in the eighth claim ) -- which , by itself , was not useful .
" [ Morse ] has [ discovered ] a method by which intelligible 24 marks or signs may be printed at a distance .
And for the method or process thus discovered , he is entitled to a patent .
But he has not discovered that the electro - magnetic current , used as motive power , in any other method , and with any other combination , will do as well . "
56 U.S. at 117 .
A generation later , considering Alexander Graham Bell 's telephone patent , the Court repeated this distinction between principle and useful process .
" [ E]lectricity , left to itself , will not do what is wanted .
The art consists in so controlling the force as to make it accomplish the purpose . "
The Telephone Cases , 126 U.S. 1 , 532 ( 1888 ) .
And it drew the line even more finely than in Morse , approving Bell 's patent not for a method tied to a working apparatus ( indeed , Bell 's actual device did not yet work when he applied for the patent ( id. at 535 ) ) , but on the physical manner of manipulating electricity to render it capable of transmitting voice .
" [ Bell ] found out that , by changing the intensity of a continuous current so as to make it correspond exactly with the changes in the density of air caused by sonorous vibrations , vocal and other sounds could be transmitted and heard at a distance .
This was the thing to be done , and Bell discovered the way of doing it . "
Id. at 538-39 .
" Bell 's patent is not alone for the particular apparatus he describes , but for the process that apparatus was designed to bring into use . "
Id. at 540 .
The telling difference between the claims before the Court in these seminal cases was that Bell 's eligible claimed process described the manipulation of a physical thing , an electrical current , which made it useful , while Morse 's ineligible eighth claim stopped short of that essential inventive contribution .
Bell 's claim specifically described a method for using elec- 25 tric current for transmitting speech that operated on a physical thing , the electric current : " by causing electrical undulations , similar in form to the vibrations of the air accompanying the said vocal or other sounds . "
126 U.S. at 531 .
This was a substantial step forward in the art , as the Court explained , an innovation that had not occurred to Bell 's many competitors .
Id. at 540 - 41 .
Morse 's ineligible claim , by contrast , provided no such physical implementation , and merely described the abstract principle of using electrical current to write at a distance : " [ T ] he essence of my invention being the use of the motive power of the electric or galvanic current , which I call electro - magnetism , however developed for marking or printing intelligible characters , signs , or letters , at any distances . "
56 U.S. at 112 .
Bell 's claim consisted of an operative , physical process , while Morse 's described only the objective of an unspecified process .
Indeed , this theme runs throughout the Court 's leading precedents .
In Le Roy , the Court did not ultimately rule on the eligibility of the patent claim , but its language clearly indicated that it expected that a physically implemented process would satisfy Section 101 .
See 55 U.S. at 175-76 .
And the critical issue in the English case that so interested this Court in Le Roy ( and for years thereafter ) was that the inventor had designed a physical manner of injecting hot air into a furnace , and was not merely seeking to patent the principle that so doing would increase a furnace 's power .
Id. ( discussing Househill Co. v. Neilson , 151 ER 1266 ( 1841 ) ) .
Seven years later , when the lawsuit in Le Roy returned to the Court on a related question , the Court was even more express about the 26 role that physical embodiment could play in patent eligibility .
However brilliant the discovery of the new principle may be , to make it useful it must be applied to some practical purpose .
. . .
" There can be no patent for a principle ; but for a principle so far embodied and connected with corporeal substances as to be in a condition to act and to produce effects in any trade , mystery , or manual occupation , there may be a patent . "
Le Roy v. Tatham , 63 U.S. 132 , 137 ( 1859 ) ( quoting Alderson B. Webster 's Patent Cases , 683 ) ( " Le Roy II " ) .
These cases teach that physical implementation of a principle in a useful manner addresses ( and , in most if not all cases , resolves ) the prohibition against patenting principles , which inheres in Section 101 .
The added complexity of the court of appeals ' " machine - or - transformation " formulation does not improve on this Court 's clearer understanding : a process that makes use of a disclosed physical thing , and produces a measurable result in the physical world , does something more than describe an unpatentable principle -- it is an application of that principle .
To be patent - eligible , therefore , a claimed method must involve one or more disclosed physical things -- that is , it must describe a series of steps that use physical means to produce a result or effect in the physical world .
Indeed , this standard ( and not " machine - or - transformation " ) has been the law for more than a century .
See Tilghman , 102 U.S. at 727 ( " Whoever 27 discovers that a certain useful result will be produced , in any art [ i.e. , process ] , machine , manufacture , or composition of matter , by the use of certain means , is entitled to a patent for it " ) ( emphasis added ) .
As explained in a Nineteenth Century treatise , the patentee must describe " a practical application to some useful purpose . . . and his specification must show the application of the principle to such a special purpose , by its incorporation with matter in such a way as to be in a condition to produce a practical result . "
George Ticknor Curtis , A Treatise on the Law of Patents for Useful Inventions as Enacted and Administered in the United States of America § 242 ( 4th ed. 1873 ) ( emphasis added ) .
The author explains that " wherever a claim does in truth sever the use of a motive - power or other elemental agency from all conditions of its application in the arts , and presents it only as a causa causans of a result , it is void ; because some practical means of producing the result is the necessary link between cause and ef- fect . "
Id. at § 160 ( emphasis in original ) .
Thus , while a disembodied principle is unpatentable , " a principle or function embodied in a particular organization of matter for a particular purpose . . . is patentable . "
Id. at § 242 ( emphasis added ) .
This standard should suffice for the next 100 years as well .
This Court has consistently grounded its patent jurisprudence in historical context , properly declining invitations to abandon long - standing doctrines even in the face of technological change .
Microsoft , 550 U.S. at 444 ( relying on Brown v. Duchesne , 60 U.S. 183 ( 1857 ) ) ; see also , e.g. , Pfaff v. Wells Elecs. , Inc. , 525 U.S. 55 , 62 ( 1998 ) ( applying " the reasoning of The Telephone Cases to the facts of the case before us today , " which involved the application of the on - sale bar in a case involving computer 28 chip socket design ) ; Bonito Boats Inc. v. Thunder Craft Boats Inc. , 489 U.S. 141 , 149-152 ( 1989 ) ( relying on Pennock v. Dialogue , 2 Pet. 1 ( 1829 ) , and other early cases ) .
Technological innovation has been transforming the Nation since the Founding , and continued advances today ( and in the future ) only confirm the relevance of this Court 's historical case law .
As this Court observed over 130 years ago , the powers granted by the Constitution " extend from the horse with its rider to the stage - coach , from the sailing - vessel to the steamboat , from the coach and the steamboat to the railroad , and from the railroad to the telegraph . "
Pensacola Tel. , 96 U.S. at 9 .
The parallel chains of continuity that connect both technology and law across the eras of our history teach that the Court 's observation can and should be updated : " and from the telegraph through the telephone , to the Internet , and beyond . "
To reiterate ( and conclude ) , this Court has long recognized that a patent - eligible method must involve one or more disclosed physical things -- that is , it must describe a series of steps that use physical means to produce a result or effect in the physical world .
This test for patent - eligibility has withstood the test of time , and it is sufficiently flexible to accommodate technological advances .
The inflexible machine - or - transformation test , in contrast , is not compelled by this Court 's historical precedents .
Indeed , the older cases cited by the government ( see U.S. Br. 29-30 ) are far more consistent with the standard proposed by this brief than the government 's alternative formulation .
Computer - implemented process claims , in general , will meet the standard historically employed by 29 this Court , which should be retained and reaffirmed .
In contrast , because the hedging method described in petitioners ' application is not sufficiently " embodied and connected with corporeal substances " ( Le Roy II , 63 U.S. at 137 ) , it is not patent - eligible under Section 101 .
CONCLUSION
The judgment of the court of appeals should be affirmed .

Counsel of record for both petitioners and respondent have consented to the filing of amicus briefs in letters that have been lodged with the Clerk .
" Physical " means anything discernible or measurable , including ( for example ) electromagnetic signals propagated through the air , electric current transmitted by wire , electrostatic or magnetic charges on appropriate media , or photonic impulses through a fiber optic cable .
See John B. Anderson , Digital Transmission Engineering 1 - 5 ( 2 ed. 2005 ) .
The historical cases focus on achieving a particular outcome or result .
See , e.g. , Holland Furniture Co. v. Perkins Glue Co. , 277 U.S. 245 , 255 ( 1928 ) ( " A patentable process is a method of treatment of certain materials to produce a particular result or product " ) ; Waxham v. Smith , 294 U.S. 20 , 22 ( 1935 )
( " By the use of materials in a particular manner he secured the performance of the function by a means which had never occurred in nature , and had not been anticipated by the prior art ; this is a patentable method or process " ) .
A useful result in the " real world " will necessarily involve a physical alteration or manipulation of matter , and ( contrary to a suggestion made below , see Pet. App. 29a-30a ) machines and processes that work with or communicate physically embodied information or data ( such as clocks , compasses , thermometers , telephones , and so forth ) have historically been considered patentable .
That is entirely consistent with the historical standard , which revolves around whether the applicant has described a physical embodiment or implementation that is capable of producing a practical outcome or result .
As an aid to comprehension , the reconfiguration is often conceptualized as the computer " running " the software or " executing " the software instructions .
In reality , however , when stored as electrical charges , the ones and zeros of the binary code produce electrical currents that literally ( but temporarily ) reconfigure the electronic pathways running between transistors in the same way that human operators reconfigured the wiring of ENIAC by hand .
In contrast , most of the briefs in this case focus on a bare handful of relatively recent opinions in which the Court considered patent - eligibility .
Diamond v. Diehr , 450 U.S. 175 ( 1981 ) ; Diamond v. Chakrabarty , 447 U.S. 303 ( 1980 ) ; Parker v. Flook , 437 U.S. 584 ( 1978 ) ; Gottschalk v. Benson , 409 U.S. 63 ( 1972 ) .
Since the Court already has been deluged with dozens of duplicative discussions of these decisions , we will not further address them , except to say that they did not overrule , nor do they require departure from , this Court 's earlier precedents considering patent - eligibility .
In addition to subject - matter eligibility , the Patent Act imposes an array of other limitations on putative patent claims , which can serve as effective checks on attempts to evade the requirements of Section 101 through abusive claim drafting .
See Novartis Br. 11 -13 .
Section 102 , which requires novelty , and Section 103 , which requires non-obviousness over the prior art , buttress Section 101's prerequisite that the claimed invention be " new and useful . "
Sections 111 through 115 place requirements on the application , ensuring that any claims that survive the earlier analysis are fairly drawn against the actual invention .
In addition to ensuring the proper disclosure of the innovation , these requirements buttress the requirements of the earlier sections .
They -- and the claim - drafting directives of Section 112 , in particular -- provide additional means by which courts can test assertions made in the claims and specification about the aspects of the invention that establish its patent - eligibility , novelty and non-obviousness .
See Morse , 56 U.S. at 117-18 ( noting that the claimant in Le Roy " was entitled to a patent for the new process or method in the art of making lead pipe , which this discovery enabled him to invent and employ ; and was bound to describe such process or method , fully , in his specification " ) ( emphasis added ) .
Three of the statutory categories of patent - eligible subject - matter ( machines , manufactures , and compositions of matter ) are not before the Court in this case .
This is important , because many computer - related inventions are comprised of , or include , product ( machine or system ) claims -- and a programmed computer is itself a patent - eligible machine if it meets the other requirements for patentability .
In re Alappat , 33 F.3d 1526 ( Fed. Cir. 1994 ) ( en banc ) .
This dynamic is neither novel nor computer - specific .
See Leeds & Catlin Co. v. Victor Talking Mach . Co. , 213 U.S. 301 , 318 ( 1909 ) ( " A process and an apparatus by which it is performed are distinct things .
They may be found in one patent ; they may be made the subject of different patents . " ) .
Score one for creativity ...
President Obama wins the Nobel Peace Prize and Republican National Committee chief Michael Steele is trying to make money off of it .
No , he 's not going to go all " commando " on the White House and try to wrest it away from the president in hopes of putting it up on Ebay or anything .
Instead , he found it so ridiculous that Obama was awarded the honor that he 's using it as a fundraising tool .
Steele sent out an email late last night not only lampooning the award but asking " truly patriotic Americans " to ante up to fight the forces of world domination .
" The Democrats and their international leftist allies want America made subservient to the agenda of global redistribution and control , " Steele wrote .
" And truly patriotic Americans like you and our Republican Party are the only thing standing in their way . "
Steele seemed to disagree with the Nobel Peace Prize committee 's reasoning for awarding him the honor .
The committee said Obama deserved the award because of his " extraordinary efforts to strengthen international diplomacy and cooperation between peoples . "
Steele , on the other hand , opined that Obama won the award for " awesomeness " -- before trashing the whole affair .
" It 's a stunning , if not truly surprising , indication of just how meaningless a once honorable and respected award has become , " Steele wrote .
Steele is not alone in his surprise .
As we told you earlier today , many people -- supporters and opponents -- do n't quite understand it .
In fact , it 's made some strange bedfellows .
Rush Limbaugh and the Taliban , for example , are united in their consternation .
It 's not as though the talk show host and the Taliban released a joint statement expressing their thoughts .
But Limbaugh noted that they were aligned .
" Folks , do you realize something has happened here that we all agree with the Taliban and Iran about and that is he does n't deserve the award , " he said .
" Now that 's hilarious , that I 'm on the same side of something with the Taliban , and that we all are on the same side as the Taliban . "
The Taliban , on the other hand , did n't mention Limbaugh in their remarks -- although that would have made their comments more interesting .
Instead , a spokesman ( incidentally from an undisclosed location ) , said Obama 's actions in Afghanistan should disqualify him .
" We have seen no change in his strategy for peace .
He has done nothing for peace in Afghanistan , " a Taliban spokesman told the AFP .
" We condemn the award of the Nobel Peace Prize for Obama . "

GENEVA , May 23 , 2009 ( KUNA ) -- Action of Citizens for the total Dismantling of Nukes ( ACDN ) said Saturday that it has just produced a 33 - page report concluding that the presence of as much as 75 tons of depleted uranium in Gaza soil is highly probable to the Israeli " Operation Cast Lead " offensive .
The operation took place between December 27 , 2008 and January 18 , 2009 .
During the first few days , a Norwegian doctor doing humanitarian service in the hospital at Shifa , Dr Mads Gilbert , denounced the presence of radioactive matter , possibly depleted uranium , in the bodies of victims .
This accusation has now emerged with greater strength after several months of investigation carried out in close liaison with the people concerned and with the help of Jean - Francois Fechino , a consultant on diffuse pollution and an expert accredited to the UN Environment ( UNEP ) .
In April 2009 , a four - person mission including Fechino , went to Gaza under the auspices of the Arab Commission for Human Rights .
The samples of earth and dust that they brought back from Gaza were then analysed by a specialist laboratory , which found in them elements of depleted uranium ( which is radioactive , carcinogenic , teratogenic ) , particles of cesium ( which is radioactive and carcinogenic ) , asbestos dust ( which is carcinogenic ) , volatile organic compounds ( VOCs , which are fine particles which endanger health , especially the health of children , asthmatics and old people ) , phosphates ( from oxidation of white phosphorus ) , tungsten ( which is carcinogenic ) , copper , aluminium oxide ( which is carcinogenic ) , and thorium oxide ( ThO2 , which is radioactive ) .

Since Mr Chirac stepped down in 2007 , Sumo has found life hard going Former French President Jacques Chirac has announced that he has given away his beloved dog after it attacked him for a third time .
Sumo , a Maltese terrier , is reported to have bitten him in the stomach in their apartment in the capital , Paris .
Mr Chirac 's wife , Bernadette , said the dog had been treated for depression after finding it difficult to come to terms with leaving the Elysee Palace .
The dog is now said to be enjoying life on a farm in the French countryside .
' Drew blood '
Since stepping down from office in May 2007 , Jacques Chirac has admitted he has found retirement hard going but apparently it is his dog , Sumo , who has suffered most acutely .
He was going wild .
He wanted to jump up and bite again
Bernadette Chirac
Used to roaming the large gardens of the Elysee Palace , the Maltese terrier has found down - sizing to an apartment on the Quai Voltaire unbearable and , according to Mrs Chirac , severe depression has turned him from an innocent white fluff - ball into a ferocious attacker of ex-presidents .
In January this year , Mr Chirac had to be hospitalised after the dog sank his teeth into an unnamed body part .
In this latest attack , Mrs Chirac said that Sumo had been lying quietly at her feet but flew into a violent rage on the approach of her husband .
The dog leapt up and nipped the former French leader in the stomach .
" I was very scared because there was blood .
It 's terrible , the small teeth like that .
He was going wild .
He wanted to jump up and bite again , " she said .
Mrs Chirac , who noted the dog had never turned against her , nevertheless made the regretful decision to send Sumo to a farm in Seine - et - Marne .
He is said to be " very happy " there , and so far has kept his teeth to himself .

Digital ' plaster ' for monitoring vital signs undergoes first clinical trials
A wireless digital ' plaster ' that can monitor vital signs continuously and remotely is being tried out with patients and healthy volunteers at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust , in a new clinical trial run by Imperial College London researchers .
Toumaz Technology Ltd's Sensium™ digital ' plaster ' or ' patch ' is a disposable device that sticks to a patient 's chest .
It is designed to allow patients to have their health monitored continuously without being wired up to bulky , fixed monitoring machines , potentially freeing some patients from their hospital beds .
The digital plaster is based on innovative technology created by engineers at Imperial College London .
It contains a wireless , smart , ultra - low power sensor platform in a silicon chip , which can monitor a range of vital signs like body temperature , heart rate and respiration in real - time .
The intention is that healthcare professionals will be able to download this information using a mobile phone , enabling them to pick up on any critical changes in their patients ' status on a 24 - 7 basis and allowing early detection and treatment of any unforeseen complications .
The data can also be integrated automatically into the patient 's electronic medical record .
The team that developed the Sensium™ digital plaster from Toumaz Technology Ltd , a spin - out from Imperial College London , hope that it will enable some patients to recover from surgery and illness at home rather than in hospital .
It should also mean that hospital in - patients have greater mobility .
In addition , it could allow doctors to extend continuous monitoring of vital signs to a broader range of patients .
The disposable plaster has a working life of several days , after which it can be replaced , ensuring that infection control can be maintained .
Professor Chris Toumazou FRS led the team that developed the plaster and he is the CEO and co-founder of Toumaz Technology Ltd and the Director of the Institute of Biomedical Engineering at Imperial College London .
He said :
" We think the digital plaster could revolutionise healthcare and we 're really excited to see it being tried out with patients for the first time .
Ultimately , the plaster could mean that doctors can keep track of any worrying changes in patients ' vital signs 24 hours a day , 7 days a week , and then deal with any problems that arise really quickly .
We think that fewer patients will have medical complications if doctors can spot health problems as soon as they arise and then treat each patient accordingly .
" We 're hoping that the plaster will improve the health and wellbeing of a vast range of patients – from patients on a general hospital ward to people with chronic diseases like diabetes and cardiovascular disease who want to have their health monitored without having to keep visiting the hospital .
At the same time , the plaster should free up doctors and nurses ' time by allowing them to keep an eye on patients without continuously checking bits of machinery , " added Professor Toumazou .
In the new trial , which is funded by CareFusion , researchers will be exploring whether the physiological data that doctors and nurses can obtain using the digital plaster system is equivalent to that which can be acquired using the current gold - standard monitors in use in hospitals .
The trial is being conducted in three phases : an initial phase with non-patient volunteers , followed by two patient study groups from Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust - patients recovering from surgery and patients with specific medical conditions in the general wards .
Those taking part in the trial will wear the digital plaster and they will also be connected to a state - of - the - art monitoring machine , so that the researchers can compare the performance of the two .
Initial results are expected by the end of December 2009 .
Dr Stephen Brett , the researcher who is leading the clinical trial , who is an Honorary Senior Lecturer at Imperial College London and a Consultant in Intensive Care Medicine at Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust , said : " This project involves taking an elegant piece of engineering , developing it into a potentially clinically usable system and evaluating it in an acute hospital setting .
Currently , unless they are in critical care or are identified as being at particular risk , most patients only have their vital signs measured every few hours .
This can't give us a complete picture of a patient 's health .
" If the new technology proves effective , it could enable us to collect vital sign information really frequently from large numbers of hospital patients , with minimal inconvenience to them .
As the plaster is wireless , we would be able to collect the data without impairing patients ' ability to move about .
This would be great because it is often important for a patient 's recovery to ensure that they can stay mobile . "
The trial is taking place within the Academic Health Science Centre ( AHSC ) , a partnership between Imperial College London and Imperial College Healthcare NHS Trust , formed in October 2007 .
The AHSC 's aim is to improve the quality of life of patients and populations by taking new discoveries and translating them into new therapies as quickly as possible .

ABSTRACT
Most programming languages support a call stack in the programming model and also in the runtime system .
We show that for applications targeting low - power embedded microcontrollers ( MCUs ) , RAM usage can be significantly decreased by partially or completely eliminating the runtime callstack .
We present flattening , a transformation that absorbs a function into its caller , replacing function invocations and returns with jumps .
Unlike inlining , flattening does not duplicate the bodies of functions that have multiple callsites .
Applied aggressively , flattening results in stack elimination .
Flattening is most useful in conjunction with a lifting transformation that moves global variables into a local scope .
Flattening and lifting can save RAM .
However , even more benefit can be obtained by adapting the compiler to cope with properties of flattened code .
First , we show that flattening adds false paths that confuse a standard live variables analysis .
The resulting problems can be mitigated by breaking spurious live - range conflicts between variables using information from the unflattened callgraph .
Second , we show that the impact of high register pressure due to flattened and lifted code , and consequent spills out of the register allocator , can be mitigated by improving a compiler 's stack layout optimizations .
We have implemented both of these improvements in GCC , and have implemented flattening and lifting as source - to - source transformations .
On a collection of applications for the AVR family of 8 - bit MCUs , we show that total RAM usage can be reduced by 20 % by compiling flattened and lifted programs with our improved GCC .

The web is covered in stink today because of a reporter for the Associated Press , Julie Jacobson , who photographed the death of a Marine whose legs had just been blown off .
The kid was Joshua Bernard , a Lance Corporal of 21 years .
When the photo appeared , Robert Gates , the Secretary of Defense [ sic ] furiously tried to get the AP to quash the photo .
It did n’t , to its everlasting credit .
To quote one of many accounts on the web :
BEFORE Joshua Bernard Somewhere there is a picture of me , looking almost exactly the same .
 Gates followed up with a scathing letter to Curley [ of AP ] yesterday afternoon .
The letter says Gates cannot imagine the pain Bernard ’s family is feeling right now , and that Curley ’s ‘ lack of compassion and common sense in choosing to put out this image of their maimed and stricken child on the front page of multiple newspapers is appalling .
The issue here is not law , policy or constitutional right — but judgment and common decency .

I thought a long time before writing about this matter , and was not pleasant to be around .
The photo resonated with me , as we say .
You see , long ago , in another pointless war , promoted by another conscienceless Secretary , I too was a Marine Lance Corporal of twenty - one years .
I too got shot , though not nearly as badly as this kid , and spent a year at Bethesda Naval Hospital .
At this point I am legally blind following my ( I think ) thirteenth trip to eye surgery as a result of an identical foreign policy .
Big fucking deal .
S__t happens .
At this point I ’m comfortable and doing fine .
Do n’t cry for me , Argentina .
The other kid is dead .
But that bothers me .
And all of this perhaps gives me a certain insight into the matter that not all reporters have , nor all editors .
It also makes me poisonously , bottle - throwing angry to think about another chilly professional bureaucrat , the Second Coming of McNamara , with less combat experience than Tinkerbell , sending kids to croak in weird places having nothing to do with the US .
But Gates .
The words decency  and unconscionable  coming from him are fetid with hypocrisy .
Gates was director of the CIA .
 Intelligence  agencies are moral dirt , hated the world over for torture , murder , and destabilization of countries leading to hundreds of thousands of deaths .
The KGB , Mossad , CIA , STASI , SAVAK — they ’re all the same .
A man who presides over torture and murder should not speak of decency .
He has none .
Nor is it easy to believe that Gates feels the slightest sympathy for the dead kid or for his family .
If you do n’t want kids to die in Afghanistan , do n’t send them there .
He does .
How sorry can he be ?
AFTER
It could almost make you turn against the war .
Some 6,000 American kids have died like this , the photographs carefully hidden by the press .
The Pentagon has killed many , many more Afghan and Iraqi civilians , and the number of permanently disabled Americans is far higher .
Today I find a column on Antiwar.com by Joe Galloway , whom I remember from UPI Saigon , entitled The War in Afghanistan is Not Worth Another American Life .
I agree .
Nor another Afghan life .
They did nothing .
Another headline notes that the Kondor Legion , the USAF , killed ninety - five Afghans in another witless air strike .
These days , we are the Nazis .
Why then is he so angry at having the war photographed ?
Easy : Spin control .
Spin is so very important in war these days .
While America is only barely a democracy , still , if the public , the great sleeping acquiescent ignorant beast , ever gets really upset , the war ends .
The Pentagon is acutely aware of this .
It remembers its disaster in Asia .
The generals of today learned nothing military from Vietnam — they are fighting the same kind of war as stupidly as before — but they learned something more important :
Their most dangerous enemy is the America public .
You .
Me. Defeating the Taliban is n’t particularly important , or even desirable .
( No war means fewer promotions and fewer contracts ) .
But while the Taliban cannot possibly defeat the Pentagon , the American public can .

Photographs are death to a war , boys and girls .
They can asphyxiate a war faster than roadside bombs can even dream .
Gates does not want the sprawling somnolent inattentive beast , the public , to see what his wars really are .
In wars , there are many enlightening things to see .
For example , the Marine with a third of his face and half a lung , going ku - kuk - kuk as red gunk rolls out of his mouth and he drowns in his blood .
Ruined or dying teenagers whimpering the trinity of the badly wounded , Mother , wife , and water .
The brain - shot guy jerking like an epileptic as he tries not to die .
Ever see brain tissue from gunshot ?
I have .
It makes a pink spew across the ground .
Like strawberry chiffon .

Gates does not want you to see this .
You would puke , buy a bottle of bourbon , and take to the streets .
He knows it .
CBS could end these wars in a week if it aired what really happens .
Gates cannot afford to let the dam break .
PR is all .
Thus Bush forbade the photographing of coffins coming home , and the CIA ferociously resists the publication of photographs of torture .
Professional sadists do things to people that would make you gag .
Then there are the enlisted men .
In these hobbyist wars , and to an extent even in peacetime , it is crucial to keep the enlisteds from thinking .
In some three decades of covering the military , I saw this constantly .
If I went to Afghanistan today as a correspondent , I could argue in private about the war with the colonel .
If I suggested to the troops that they were being suckered , the colonel would go crazy .
Next to keeping the public quiescent , keeping the troops ( and potential recruits ) bamboozled is vital .
If a high - school kid saw what awaited , if he saw the cartilage glistening in wrecked joints , he would n’t sign .
Do I think that the press should publish such photos ?
Not yes but hell yes on afterburner .
Every time an editor covers for the Pentagon , every time papers refuse to show the charred bodies still slowly moving , the dead children , the never mind .
The effect is to ensure that more kids will die the same way .
And the press almost always does exactly this .
We are a trade of whores and shills .
Except that whores give value for money .
The press kills our children .
Julie Jacobson sounds like that modern - day rarity , a reporter , as distinguished from a volunteer flack .
Bless her .
I used to wonder whether women could hack it as combat correspondents .
I no longer do .
( There are lots of them . )
I used to refer to smarmy over - groomed bloodthirsty office warts as pussies , saying that they lacked balls .
The anatomical reference no longer works .
I note that Jacobson has more combat time than the aggregate for Bush II , Cheney , Rumsfeld , Rice , Obama , Biden , Gonzalez , Clinton , Perle , Abrams , Kristol , Feith , Podhoretz , Krauthammer , George Will , Dershowitz , and Gates .
These men , if the word is appropriate , killed that kid .
Jacobson just caught them in the act .

The Best of Fred Reed
Amid growing outrage in Pakistan regarding the Kerry - Lugar Aid Bill , the United States is reportedly working behind the scenes with top members of Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari ’s inner circle , one of the few factions in Pakistan that seems to support accepting the aid , to figure out how to salvage the package .
President Zardari has been meeting with senior members of his ruling Pakistani Peoples Party ( PPP ) to discuss ways to sell the bill to parliament , which is seen as almost certain to reject the bill following intense military opposition .
The bill , which passed through the US Senate last week , pledges billions of dollars in aid to Pakistan but issues a series of harsh statements and demands , including giving the US formal oversight over the nation ’s court system and military .
The onerous strings attached have led some in Pakistan ’s government to term it a “ treaty of surrender . ”
The solution to these complaints , as it stands , is a public promise from Sen .
Kerry that there are “ no conditions ” on the aid no matter what the bill actually says .
Also seen as a key would be a signing statement from President Obama basically disavowing much of the language of the bill .
Trust in US promises is in short supply in Pakistan , however , and it remains to be seen if it will make any difference at all .

A 46 - year - old Burlington woman accused of teaching her teenage son how to shoot heroin was charged Monday in connection with his death from an overdose .
Patricia L. Strosina was charged with intentionally contributing to the delinquency of a child resulting in death in connection with the death of her 16 - year - old son Raymond Strosina , according to a criminal complaint .
The boy was found by his father in the father 's home in the Town of Waterford on Sept. 14 , slumped over a desk in a basement computer room , according to the complaint .
A syringe , a burned spoon and other drug paraphernalia were found nearby .
Online state court records indicate the boy 's parents divorced in 2005 .
An autopsy determined that Raymond died of respiratory arrest and a mixed drug overdose that included heroin and cocaine .
According to the complaint , several people , including a " case worker , " told an investigator with the Racine County Sheriff 's Department that the teen had been shooting heroin with his mother .
The complaint does not give any details about the case worker 's identity or affiliation , and a spokesman for the sheriff 's department spokesman was not available for comment .
The sheriff 's department investigator was told that Patricia Strosina would take her son along with her to buy heroin and that she would " not cut Ray off because he would get sick " from withdrawal .
The investigator also was told that the boy was seen smoking marijuana when he was about 14 years old , that his mother taught him how to shoot heroin , and that she was seen injecting her son with the drug .
The woman also was seen smoking marijuana and crack cocaine with the boy , according to the complaint .
One witness described how Strosina , her son and others would shoot up in Strosina 's car after a drug run and how the only conversation that took place in the vehicle would be about " who would get the first needle and who would get the last bit of heroin . "
According to the complaint , Patricia Strosina admitted to using heroin and OxyContin , a prescription pain medication , but she said she and her son were " getting off " heroin .
She also admitted taking him with her to Milwaukee to buy heroin and said the last time she used the drug with her son was the weekend before his death .
She said on one occasion , after a drug buy , that she shot heroine while driving before passing it to her son in the back seat so he could use the drug .
She said she and her son typically would share about $ 20 worth of the drug at a time .
The complaint did not indicate how much she or the boy used on a weekly basis .
The complaint says that the mother 's actions " encouraged and contributed to Raymond Strosina 's drug use , which eventually led to his death . "
Online state court records show that cash bond for Patricia Strosina was set Monday at $ 15,000 .
The Racine County Jail
Web site showed that she was being held at the jail .
If convicted , she faces a maximum penalty of 25 years in prison and a $ 100,000 fine .
YouTube may pay less to be online than you do , a new report on internet connectivity suggests , calling into question a recent analysis arguing Google 's popular video service is bleeding money and demonstrating how the internet has continued to morph to fit user 's behavior .
In fact , with YouTube 's help , Google is now responsible for at least 6 percent of the internet 's traffic , and likely more – and may not be paying an ISP at all to serve up all that content and attached ads .
Credit Suisse made headlines this summer when it estimated that YouTube was binging on bandwidth , losing Google a half a billion dollars in 2009 as it streams 75 billion videos .
But a new report from Arbor Networks suggests that Google 's traffic is approaching 10 percent of the net 's traffic , and that it 's got so much fiber optic cable , it is simply trading traffic , with no payment involved , with the net 's largest ISPs .
" I think Google 's transit costs are close to zero , " said Craig Labovitz , the chief scientist for Arbor Networks and a longtime internet researcher .
Arbor Networks , which sells network monitoring equipment used by about 70 percent of the net 's ISPs , likely knows more about the net 's ebbs and flows than anyone outside of the National Security Agency .
And the extraordinary fact that a website serving nearly 100 billion videos a year has no bandwidth bill means the net is n't the network it used to be .
But the lack of a monthly bill in the mailbox does n't mean Google 's internet connection is free — it 's just that it has purchased unused fiber optic cable known as " dark fiber " — and uses it to carry its traffic to other networks where it " peers " or trades traffic with other ISPs .
Its costs for bandwidth are then amortized across the life of its fiber and routers .
YouTube has been mum on its actual costs , for competitive reasons , but did say in blog post in July that it has homegrown infrastructure and that traditional pricing models do n't apply .
There 's been a lot of speculation lately about how much it costs to run YouTube ....
The truth is that all our infrastructure is built from scratch , which means models that use standard industry pricing are too high when it comes to bandwidth and similar costs .
We are at a point where growth is definitely good for our bottom line , not bad .
In fact , YouTube 's low or nonexistent bandwidth bill points to a very important shift in the structure of the internet , which is rapidly becoming much more complicated .
Traditionally the net has been shaped like a pyramid with small ISPs at the bottom , connecting up to regional carriers , that connect to backbone and transcontinental carriers .
It 's much more complicated now with the top 30 websites serving up 30 percent of net traffic , either from their own sets of pipes or from data centers around the world that connect much closer to your computer – and for much cheaper – than ever before .
It 's just one of many changes in how the net is structured , a change that started in 2007 , according the report .
In 2007 , the majority of the internet 's traffic came distributed by 30,000 blocks of servers around the net ( technically Autonomous System Numbers ) .
In 2009 , 150 blocks served up half of the net 's traffic .
" What we mean by the internet is changing and it 's happening really quickly , " Labovitz said .
" I was blown away to find out that one - tenth of the internet is going [ to ] or coming from Google . "
Those blocks include Google and increasingly popular and cheap content - delivery networks , such as Akamai and Limelight , which serve content from websites such as Wired.com from server farms around the net — often at rates far cheaper than self - hosting .
Which is to say that the real money is in the ads and services in the packets , not in moving the bits from computer to computer .
The cost of bandwidth has fallen and so too have the profit margins for moving bits , even as traffic grows at an estimated 40 percent a year .
With the growth of Google 's network and Content Delivery Networks , the economics of who pays whom to connect grows more complicated than the early days of the net when money flowed upwards — little ISPs paid regional ISPs who paid major ISPs who paid backbone operators .
Now if you are Google , you might even begin asking Comcast to pay up to connect its Google Tubes straight to their local cable ISP networks .
That way , YouTube videos and Google search results would show up faster , letting the ISP brag that YouTube does n't stutter on their network , a potential commercial advantage over its DSL competitors .
" Who pays whom is changing , " Labovitz said .
" All sorts of negotiations are happening behind closed doors . "
Unfortunately , few will know the outcomes of those talks , since most of the net 's architecture , let alone the financial machinations behind them , remain a secret cloaked in nondisclosure agreements .
But Labovitz says the changes will have a big upside for typical net users , who are already seeing faster downloads .
For instance , many videos on YouTube now come in HD , an option that would have been unthinkable in the days when its video always seemed to be stuttering and buffering .
Labovitz also expects ISPs to react to falling margins for moving internet traffic by continuing to offer more and better services , such as backup services , smartphone apps to control their in - the - cloud cable DVRs or online video services like the controversial ESPN 360 .
That 's all part of their attempts to become something other than just dumb pipes ferrying YouTube videos — and Google 's ads — to your computer .
A full report , co-written with select academics , will be presented at the end of the month at the NANOG47 meeting , a gathering of net traffic engineers from North America .
However , the Arbor Networks data is not available to other researchers due to confidentiality agreements , according to Labovitz .

this morning , just an hour after the story first broke that the Obama administration is preparing to bring Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and four other prisoners to the US mainland to face trials in federal court for their alleged involvement in the 9/11 attacks .
As I explained to Amy Goodman and Juan Gonzalez , this is good news to the extent that the whole of the “ War on Terror ” — with its egregious human rights violations — was supposedly justified as being necessary for the pursuit and capture of those responsible for the 9/11 attacks , and although I believe that the government will be able to avoid having to dwell on the fact that Mohammed and his co-defendants were all tortured in secret CIA prisons if the Justice Department is able to produce any evidence whatsoever of their involvement in the attacks , I explained to Amy and Juan that I was deeply disappointed to hear that it is expected that other prisoners — including Abdul Rahim al - Nashiri , another CIA prisoner , who , like Mohammed and Abu Zubaydah , was subjected to waterboarding , a form of controlled drowning — will not face a federal court trial , but will , instead , be put forward for trial by Military Commission .
As I have explained at length over the last two and a half years ( and as the Commissions ’ former prosecutor , Morris Davis , explained in a op - ed for the Wall Street Journal this week ) , the revival of the discredited Commissions , which struggled in vain to establish their legitimacy over the course of seven years , demonstrates only that the administration lacks the courage to trust the federal courts , and , as a result , is prepared to endorse the existence of a second - tier judicial system to be used in cases where it fears that the evidence will not be strong enough to secure a conviction .
I count myself fortunate to have had this interview scheduled on the day that such an important story broke , but was also glad that there was time to discuss — and show clips from — my new documentary film “ Outside the Law : Stories from Guantánamo ” ( co- directed by Polly Nash ) , which I have been showing in New York , Washington D.C. and the Bay Area over the last week , and which was the initial spur for my appearance on the show .
I was also rather touched that I was able to take part in the last ever show in the firehouse on Lafayette Street , where Democracy Now ! has spent so many long and happy years , and I wish Amy , Juan and the rest of the team all the best in their new studio in Chelsea .

About “ Outside the Law : Stories from Guantánamo ”
“ Outside the Law : Stories from Guantánamo ” is a new documentary film , directed by Polly Nash and Andy Worthington ( and inspired by Andy ’s book , The Guantánamo Files ) .
The film tells the story of Guantánamo ( and includes sections on extraordinary rendition and secret prisons ) with a particular focus on how the Bush administration turned its back on domestic and international laws , how prisoners were rounded up in Afghanistan and Pakistan without adequate screening ( and often for bounty payments ) , and why some of these men may have been in Afghanistan or Pakistan for reasons unconnected with militancy or terrorism ( as missionaries or humanitarian aid workers , for example ) .
The film is based around interviews with former prisoners ( Moazzam Begg and , in his first major interview , Omar Deghayes , who was released in December 2007 ) , lawyers for the prisoners ( Clive Stafford Smith in the UK and Tom Wilner in the US ) , and journalist and author Andy Worthington , and also includes appearances from Guantánamo ’s former Muslim chaplain James Yee , Shakeel Begg , a London - based Imam , and the British human rights lawyer Gareth Peirce .
Focusing on the stories of three particular prisoners — Shaker Aamer ( who is still held ) , Binyam Mohamed ( who was released in February 2009 ) and Omar Deghayes — “ Outside the Law : Stories from Guantánamo ” provides a powerful rebuke to those who believe that Guantánamo holds “ the worst of the worst ” and that the Bush administration was justified in responding to the terrorist attacks of September 11 , 2001 by holding men neither as prisoners of war , protected by the Geneva Conventions , nor as criminal suspects with habeas corpus rights , but as “ illegal enemy combatants ” with no rights whatsoever .

Can I get you anything , sir ?
A black eye ?
A broken jaw ?
I ask because last week it was announced that some restaurants have stopped adding service to the bill .
Why ?
The law has changed .
Restaurants can no longer pocket this money , but must give it to the staff .
This has started a tipping debate
To tip or not to tip ?
This is irrelevant .
I always tip .
Not because of the service , but because watching waiters wait is fascinating .
You may think you are just walking into a restaurant , but if you are lucky , you will also walk into a story .
Only a fool reads the menu in Cafe Rouge .
Read the waiters instead .
For years I was a part - time waitress .
I once worked in a restaurant , with a gay Irish alcoholic manager .
I will call him Eric .
He was always drinking vodka out of teacups , and was once arrested for stealing the restaurant 's entire stock of toilet rolls .
The police pulled him over for erratic driving , opened the boot , and discovered the cache of toilet rolls .
The owner defended him .
" He 's a criminal , " he told the police , " but he 's my criminal . "
Eric once attacked me in the middle of the restaurant , and had to be pulled off by a customer .
( I can't remember why , exactly ; I think I may have commented on his skin . )
One of the waiters , who had piles , once attacked my sister – with a mop .
He appeared out of the broom cupboard , brandishing his mop , and thumped her with it .
I came to her defence .
Soon , a whole crocodile of waiters were pushing the waiter – and the mop – back into the broom cupboard .
I complained to the owner .
" He attacked my sister with a mop , " I said .
" He 's got piles , " the owner replied , " What do you expect ? "
One of the chefs , meanwhile , was a part - time drug dealer .
She once sold me some speed , and I took it , went green , and hid in the broom cupboard , writing an epic love poem about a boy called Julian .
The customers were merely irritants in our daily opera of madness .
We tolerated them benignly , like naughty children who , incomprehensibly , wanted things .
" It wants an OJ [ orange juice ] . "
" It wants a DC [ Diet Coke ] . "
" It wants an HB [ hamburger ] . "
" What is wrong with it ? "
Occasionally , but not often , the customers could be offensive .
There was the man who touched my bottom as I walked through the restaurant .
I slowly put the plate down and slapped him round the face .
" She slapped me round the face ! " he screamed at Eric .
" He touched my arse ! " I screamed at Eric .
" Nothing I can do , " Eric said , like King Solomon , but drinking neat vodka from a teacup .
( How I loved this man ! )
" You touched her arse . "
" Yes , I did , " said the customer .
He gave me a fiver .
Was I a good waitress ?
Well , it depended on my mood .
Every Saturday morning , a nice man called John would come in and give me an ecstasy tablet .
I was sometimes even tipped in pills .
( I am now , I would like to mention , comprehensively clean – I am on gum . )
So , on Saturdays , I was a very happy waitress .
" Whitebait ? " I would simper ecstatically , as my mad , drugged eyes took in the table of four .
For some reason , they always looked slightly afraid .
Sometimes I was a very angry waitress ; I would come over with a hamburger , shriek " dead cow ! " and throw it down .
I was , for a time , in love with the scrawny but mesmerising assistant chef , and when the piles waiter was n't crying in the broom cupboard we would have sex in it .
If he ignored me , I would be intemperate with the customers ; if he was kind , I would sprinkle them with bon mots , while they were trying to eat .
There is a restaurant , which I go to with my friend .
And there is a waiter there who hates us .
His face falls when we walk in , as if he is remembering an ancient wrong .
We have a standoff with him .
How long until he brings the menu ?
How long will he leave it this time ?
How long will he dare ?
Fourteen , 15 , 16 minutes – oh , he 's pretended he 's just seen us .
He walks towards us , looking amazed as if he has never seen customers before .
What is this odd new species ?
Customers !
Welcome !
Now the drinks .
How long ?
How long ?
The entire experience is like an episode of The Krypton Factor .
We do n't need to think of anything to say ; all we talk about is how much this waiter hates us , and why .
What is his inner life ?
What does he think about at bedtime ?
Then we tip – 15 % , or 20 % if he has n't physically attacked us – and leave .
It is better than TV .
It 's a novella .
Say it is n't so , Harriet
Harriet Harman is reported as having " clipped " a car while driving , while talking on her mobile phone , while being deputy prime minister , all at the same time .
Oh , Harriet , how could you , if it is true ?
( She denies any wrongdoing . )
You are our shining deputy prime minister and you remind me of a big , red , human fingernail .
How could you wind down your window and say , " I am Harriet Harman , you know where you can get hold of me . "
( Or so witnesses said . )
As in , " I am Elvis . " " I am Kylie . "
" I am Jeffrey Archer . "
How could you place yourself alongside the bottle blondes in their 4X4s who , babbling nonsense into their mobiles , turn demonic north London postcodes into Death Row every weekday afternoon ?
How could you ?
How could you ?
If it is true .
Is it ?
HARRISBURG , Pa. —
Close to 1500 Pennsylvanians packed the main Capitol rotunda recently to call for passage of a bill that could make their state the first in the nation to put a single payer health insurance plan in place .
State Sen. Jim Ferlo from western Pennsylvania captured the sentiment of the day and drew loud applause when he told the crowd , “ We are for a public option ; a public option is a single payer plan . ”
He went on to say that “ We have never seen such a movement for health care as we see today , but our voices are not always heard because we are facing a corporate media . ”
He called the attempts by some in Congress to appease the private health insurance industry “ gobbledy gook ” and contrasted the complex 1000 page bills with the single payer HR 676 , which he noted is only nine pages long .
Kevin Zeese of Prosperity Agenda agreed and denounced the influence of big insurance in Washington saying “ We need to make the insurance industry radioactive ! ”
The rally drew supporters from all parts of the state and included a wide range of health care , professional , community , labor and faith based groups .
They carried signs bearing the words “ Everybody in ; Nobody out ! ” and “ Health care for all now ” .
One sign proclaimed “ Pregnant with hope for health care for all ! ”
The crowd was addressed by a remarkable range of speakers : some from local Pennsylvania communities and some from national organizations .
Former CIGNA executive Wendell Potter told how he had travelled a political journey from private insurance industry PR representative to strong advocate for single payer .
Dr. Margaret Flowers of Physicians for a National Health Program ( PNHP ) , one of the activists forcibly removed from the Senate Finance Committee hearings earlier this year , said that making sure everyone has access to quality health care “ is what civilized countries do . ”
The rally also included moments of levity and political satire , such as when the “ billionaires for wealthcare now ” displayed signs reading “ Down with socialism !
Up with feudalism ! ”
Following the rally , the crowd broke into smaller groups , and many headed for the offices of key legislators to urge support for the two key bills which would bring a single payer plan to the keystone state .
House Bill 1660 and its companion Senate Bill 400 have the support of organizations ranging from PNHP and the Progressive Democrats of America to the Pennsylvania AFL - CIO , represented at the rally by its president Bill George , to the nonpartisan League of Women Voters .
Governor Ed Rendell has said he would sign single payer legislation if it reaches his desk .

I ’ve spent most of my developer life solving scientific problems and developing tools to make people more productive in one way or another .
A field of software development with which I have had very little involvement is games development .
To be honest , I am not even much of a game player , let alone developer .
Sure , I enjoy 5 minutes alone with Flight Control or Fieldrunners as much as the next guy , but beyond that , most games do n’t really hold my interest .
I would rather be creating something myself .
So I am perhaps the last person you would expect to develop an iPhone game .
Nevertheless , my first — and probably last — game appeared in the App Store last week : Sumo Master .
The story of Sumo Master extends back almost a year .
In this tutorial , I want to tell the story of Sumo Master , why I developed it , and what I learnt along the way .
Conception
The idea for Sumo Master was actually conceived by my brother during one of many iPhone app brainstorming email exchanges .
In amongst a list of potential iPhone apps , one more ludicrous than another , was the idea for a sumo game in which you tried to push other sumos out of the ring .
At the time there were no similar games on the iPhone , and it seemed well suited to the device , so the idea stuck .
The original concept was quite a bit different to the final game .
The intention was that sumos would be controlled much like balls , ala Super Monkey Ball .
You would roll your Sumo by tilting the device , and try to knock other ball - like sumos out of the ring .
( As an aside , a game like this , called iBot Sumo , is now in the App Store .
Shows there is nothing new under the sun ! )
I pretty quickly moved away from the ‘ rolling ’ sumos idea , but it took longer to realize that the tilt control was also not right for this game .
More on that later .
Simple Rules , Complex Behavior
The game probably would never have been developed if not for a period of boredom around the 2008 Christmas break .
I decided to take on a short , fun project unrelated to my work , and chose the sumo game .
After all , how hard could it be , right ?
I began with square UIView s , and used Core Animation to move them around on the screen .
The rules of movement were quite simple : Squares would attack any nearby , smaller square , while trying not to go out of the ring .
Apart from these simple behavioral rules , the squares did not actually interact , so they could move right through one another .
Putting aside the sumo game for a moment , this was a very interesting exercise .
The simulation I developed was not totally dissimilar to an astronomical simulation of a star field .
It was fun to just watch the squares cluster and move apart , and observe the effect of changing parameters such as the number and size of squares .
As is now well established in science , simple dynamical rules can lead to interesting and seemingly complex behavior .
During this phase , I setup the basics of the game internals .
There was a simple game loop , in the form of an NSTimer that would fire every 0.2 seconds .
When the timer fired , the model would be propagated 0.2 seconds into the future .
The resulting position of each square would be used to set the target position of the corresponding UIView .
The actual animation of the square on the screen would be left to the Core Animation background thread .
Here is the source code that was used to update the position of the squares , and the corresponding views on the screen .
-( void)nextAnimationStep :( NSTimer *) timer { [ UIView beginAnimations : @" Sumo Moves " context : NULL ] ; [ UIView setAnimationDuration : ANIMATION_TIME_INTERVAL ] ; [ UIView setAnimationCurve:UIViewAnimationCurveLinear ] ; for ( SSSumo * sumo in sumos ) { [ sumo updateDynamicQuantities ] ; SSSumoView * sumoView = [ sumoViews objectForKey : [ NSValue valueWithPointer:sumo ] ] ; sumo.positionX += sumo.velocityX * ANIMATION_TIME_INTERVAL ; sumo.positionY += sumo.velocityY * ANIMATION_TIME_INTERVAL ; sumoView.center = CGPointMake(sumo.positionX , sumo.positionY ) ; } [ UIView commitAnimations ] ; }
The Euler method , probably the simplest of all propagators , was used in this and all later versions of the game .
In a scientific simulation , this would be a no - no , but in games , you can cut corners as long as nobody notices .
That ’s one of the big differences between developing a game and a scientific app .
The updateDynamicQuantities method hides quite a lot of the complexity .
Each square already had the properties of a sumo : mass , radius , velocity , maximum speed , acceleration , and maximum acceleration .
These quantities remained the basis of sumo movement throughout the game ’s development , though the values assigned to each were regularly varied to produce different physics .
Collisions
Collisions are probably one of the harder aspects of game physics to get right .
I did n’t want to resort to using an off - the - shelf game physics engine with Sumo Master , because it was a hobby project , and part of the fun was just trying to figure out how to do it yourself .
( If you do want a game engine , take a look at Cocos2d . )
It soon became abundantly clear that the basic physics you learn in high school , or even university , were not really going to help that much .
My first attempts involved completely elastic collisions .
As you can see in this movie of an early simulation with colored dots , the balls do n’t feel much like sumo wrestlers ( although it is still fun to watch ) .
Even when you put a sumo - like JPEG on each one , it still felt more like a bucket of golf balls than soft spongy sumos .
In a perfectly elastic world , where objects are like eight balls and all collisions instantaneous , it may have been enough , but sumos are fat and spongy , and stick together .
In short , I needed a way to model inelasticity .
I actually do n’t know what real scientific models of inelasticity look like , but I came up with something that seemed to work OK .
Basically , I used a simple power law to model the force exerted versus the compression .
F is the force at a separation of d. r 1 and r 2 are the radii of the respective sumos .
In this equation , a simple harmonic force has been assumed with a force constant of k , though higher order formulas were also tested .
This formula does n’t in itself result in any inelasticity ; in order to absorb energy during a collision , the force constant , k , needs to be varied during the collision .
If the sumos are coming together , with the separation ( d ) decreasing , one value is used , and when the separation is increasing , a smaller value is used .
The effect of this is that the forces for expansion are smaller than compression at any given separation , leading to an overall loss of energy .
By varying the magnitudes of the two force constants , you can make the sumos bounce like a ball , or stick together like they are smothered in glue , or anything in between .
By making the force constant bigger for expansion than compression , you end up introducing new energy into the system , and you get a pin ball cushion type effect .
This was used for the red pylons in the game , which fling the sumos off at speed .
Biomechanics
Even with a means of modeling elasticity , the game still did n’t feel ‘ realistic ’ .
For example , if a sumo charged another sumo from behind , it gained no advantage , and if a smaller sumo took a long run up to charge another stationary sumo , it came almost immediately to a halt .
These aspects did not fit with my mental picture of a sumo contest .
What was missing ?
Biomechanics .
My model was fine for ball - like objects , but sumos are people , and they have the physical limitations of people .
If you push one from behind , its ability to remain on the spot is less than if you push it from in front .
A sumo that is stationary or walking backwards is much less capable of exerting a force than one that is moving forward ( eg charging ) .
Without going to the extreme of modeling a complete human body , I was able to come up a simple rule which made the sumos in the game feel more realistic .
I basically took the projection of the velocity of each sumo along the line of centers , and determined the ratio .
This ratio — having been conditioned a bit to ensure it was not too big or small — was used as a multiplier for the force .
If one sumo had a greater component of velocity toward the other , this resulted in a greater force .
If a sumo was walking backwards , its velocity component toward the other sumo would be negative , and its exertion impeded as a result .
Control
The original plan to use tilt control for the sumos was soon abandoned .
It was just too difficult to control a sumo when other sumos were actively trying to push it out of the arena .
This type of control works OK when you have almost full control of what happens to your character , but when opponents have a say too , it becomes unwieldly .
In the end , I decided to use about the most simple gesture you can imagine : point to destination .
The sumo would just go where you pointed … or try to .
I only made one major change to the original implementation : Initially , if you took your finger off the screen , the sumo would stop moving .
Effectively this meant you had to pretty much keep your finger constantly on the screen , which would mean your hand could get in the way of the action .
At some point I realized that by simply making the sumo go to the last point of finger contact , it would be easier to control the game .
The last point of contact was delineated on the screen by a gray target , so the player could see where the sumo was headed at all times .
Using this approach , you can control the sumo with infrequent taps , rather than constant dragging on the screen .
Such a small change , but it made a big difference .
Performance and The Game Loop
Toward the end of development , we started to look at performance .
The game would jump a little at times , especially when there were lots of sumos on the screen at once .
The problem seemed to be purely related to graphics , rather than anything to do with game mechanics .
One thing I did to help matters was decrease the size of the sumos a little .
This improved graphics performance by causing less of the screen to redraw in each frame .
Another change I made at this point , though it is questionable whether it led to much performance gain , was to replace the UIImageView s used for the sumos with plain CALayer ’s .
By setting the content property to a CGImageRef , the layer will display an image .
In addition to moving from layers to views , I also took over most of the animation myself , and implemented a more traditional game loop .
The NSTimer was made to fire at 30 fps , rather than 5 , and all Core Animation actions were disabled during movement of the sumos .
The code looks like this
// Sumos [ CATransaction begin ] ; [ CATransaction setValue :( id ) kCFBooleanTrue forKey :kCATransactionDisableActions ] ; for ( SSSumo * sumo in mutableSumos ) { SSSumoLayer * sumoLayer = [ sumoLayers objectForKey : [ NSValue valueWithPointer:sumo ] ] ; sumoLayer.position = CGPointMake(sumo.positionX , sumo.positionY ) ; if ( sumo .isAlive ) { [ sumoLayer updateRotationForSumo:sumo ] ; } } [ CATransaction commit ] ;
At about this time , I read about dynamic frame skipping in the Apress book iPhone Game Projects , and decided to implement that too .
It ’s actually a pretty simple algorithm :
See how much time has passed since the last update .
Calculate how many steps to propagate for that time .
Propagate the model that number of steps .
Update the view for the new model state .
Basically , instead of doing a fixed number of steps each time , you check to see how much time actually passed , and adapt to that .
In code it looks like this
// Determine how many steps to propagate NSTimeInterval propTimeStep = ANIMATION_TIME_INTERVAL
/ PROPAGATION_STEPS_PER_ANIMATION_STEP
; NSTimeInterval timeSinceLast = ANIMATION_TIME_INTERVAL
; if ( lastUpdate ) timeSinceLast = - 1.0 f * [ lastUpdate timeIntervalSinceNow ] ; NSInteger numberPropagationSteps = MAX ( 0.0f , timeSinceLast / propTimeStep ) ; ... lastUpdate = [ NSDate dateWithTimeIntervalSinceNow:( numberPropagationSteps*propTimeStep - timeSinceLast ) ] ;
Core Animation
Core Animation was used for the game itself , but also for all of the peripheral screens that you need in a game .
One of my favorites is the sumo chooser screen , where you pick which sumo you are going to play with .
Originally , I had in mind quite a simple animation , where you would click a sumo , and a picture would descend from above , and some statistics from below , like in this version .
When I presented this to my designer , Marcello Luppi , he was n’t impressed , and came back the next day with the complex sequence of animations and fades that appear in the shipping product .
Marcello designed the sequence in Photoshop , but he used a neat trick to show me how it should look : he made a bunch of JPEG snapshots , and sent them to me .
He told me to open the first one in QuickLook , and then scan through them quickly by holding the down arrow key .
The effect is the same as a kid ’s flick book .
Worked great to see the intricacies of the animation so that I could figure out how to code it .
If you have n’t seen the game , here is what the final sumo chooser screen behaves like .
The coding itself is not terribly difficult , but quite laborious .
It ’s all about knowing who goes where and when .
Here is a little of the code to give you a flavor :
static CGFloat AnimationBeginSumoHighlight = 0.0f ; static CGFloat AnimationBeginSumoTurn = 0.1f ; static CGFloat AnimationDurationSumoHighlight = 0.15f ; static CGFloat AnimationDurationSumoTurn = 0.2f ; -( void) showDescriptionForSumoIndex:( NSUInteger)sumoIndex { UIButton * sumoButton = [ sumoButtons objectAtIndex:sumoIndex -1 ] ; //
Select the clicked sumo UIImageView * sumoHighlightImageView = [ sumoHighlightImageViews objectAtIndex:sumoIndex-1 ] ; [ UIView beginAnimations : @" Sumo Highlight " context : NULL ] ; [ UIView setAnimationDuration:AnimationDurationSumoHighlight ] ; [ UIView setAnimationDelay: AnimationBeginSumoHighlight ] ; sumoHighlightImageView.alpha = 1.0 f ; [ UIView commitAnimations ] ; //
Unselected sumos turn to walk out [ UIView beginAnimations : @" Sumos Turn " context : NULL ] ; [ UIView setAnimationDuration:AnimationDurationSumoTurn ] ; [ UIView setAnimationDelay: AnimationBeginSumoTurn ] ; NSUInteger i ; for ( i = 1 ; i <= 4 ; ++i ) { UIButton * button = [ sumoButtons objectAtIndex :i- 1 ] ; button.userInteractionEnabled = NO ; if ( i != sumoIndex ) { button .
transform = CGAffineTransformMakeRotation ( ( i % 2 ? - 1 : +1 ) * M_PI / 2 ) ; } } [ UIView commitAnimations ] ;
This piece of code only covers the point in time when you tap a sumo , it lights up , and the other sumos turn to the side in order to walk off .
The rest of the animation is similar , but there is quite a lot of it all up .
It took about a day to code , but I think the end result was worth it , with all the component animations working together to create a fluid whole .
Squashing a Sumo
I ended up using Core Animation in some ways that I had n’t anticipated .
For example , initially the sumos were completely static images that would rotate and translate , but nothing more .
They did n’t feel like living things , or even bouncy toys .
We did n’t want to go down the route of completely animating the sumos , because that was n’t really the point of this particular game .
In some ways , they were supposed to feel a bit like inanimate toys , but even inanimate toys move a bit .
I thought I would try to use Core Animation transforms to make the sumos appear to squash or even wobble .
As it turned out , I was able to do a reasonable job of both effects , but only the squash made it into the game , due to performance constraints .
Below is a movie with some particularly bouncy sumos , that demonstrate the wobble and squash effects .
All are generated using a single static image .
I realized pretty quickly that what was needed to squash a sumo was a scale transform .
But blindly scaling the sumo along the axis of collision would cause it to become discus shaped , with both the back and front squashing inwards ( see diagram below ) .
I only wanted the collision side to squash in , and the back side to remain relatively unaffected .
The trick I came up with is to first translate the sumo so that the origin of the coordinate system is approximately along its spinal column , and then to scale .
That way , areas furthest from the origin , such as the naval , will translate the greatest distance , and the back of the sumo will scale very little in absolute terms .
Just like a Real Game
Even when the game is working the way you want it to , there are still a lot of last minute things to do .
For example , you need sound effects , and music .
For music , we purchased some stock Japanese pieces for a small fee , and played them back using the AVAudioPlayer class .
Sound effects were either taken from Garage Band , or created ourselves : every grunt you hear is yours truly , with a lick of Amadeus Pro effect for disguise .
Sound effects were played back using the System Sound Services API .
One of the last aspects added to the game , but one which makes it much more interesting , were the moving red pillars .
Initially you would just fight other sumos in a static arena .
We were playing with the idea of having some static pillars at the side that you could bounce off , but at the last minute we came up with the idea of having the pillars move in different patterns , sometimes even crossing the arena itself .
This added immensely to the game play .
In terms of implementation , these pillars were very easy to introduce , because they are actually just other sumos in disguise .
By changing the inelasticity force constants , they were made very bouncy , like pin ball cushions , but otherwise , they are just sumos following a predefined path .
Multiplayer
When Apple released the 3.0 SDK , we knew we could n’t really put out a fighting game without a multiplayer mode .
It gave me a few days of headaches , but it worked out in the end .
What I found difficult was that events could happen in different ways when you have a multiplayer UI .
For example , one player could pause ; you have to make sure the other player also gets paused , and then also ensure that both players can reenter the game together .
All in all , a bit of a harrowing experience , but doable .
The Game Kit API actually does make it pretty easy to communicate .
You simply send any data you like to a peer in a single call .
You can send the data in one of two modes : reliable or unreliable .
If you send it in reliable mode , it will get to the destination , barring network disconnection or some other catastrophe .
If you use the unreliable mode , you ca n’t guarantee the data will get across , or the order in which it will arrive , but if it does make it , it will get there fast .
I ended up using the reliable mode for all essential information , such as initial setup , pausing or stopping the game , etc .
I used the unreliable mode to update sumo state several times a second .
Game for more ?
All in all , it took me about 2 months of solid coding to develop Sumo Master , and Marcello was busy coming up with graphics for a big chunk of that time too .
Quite a lot of work for what you would probably think was a very simple game just to look at it .
Probably the most important thing I learnt in the process was that although there is some overlap between games programming and scientific programming , in that both deal with physical modeling , with games programming it comes down to giving the impression of completeness and complexity , when in reality you are really cutting corners and doing everything as simply as possible .
The skills you carry over from science are useful , but the attitude you need for games programming is different .

I never met Pete Shellem .
I had n't heard of him until reading his obituary last week through a link on the blog of New York criminal defense attorney Scott Greenfield .
But I wish I 'd had a drink with the guy .
In an age when journalism has been inflicted not only by ballyhooed budget woes and challenges from new media , but also a glut of dubious trend stories , horserace political coverage , and endless navel - gazing about the state of the profession , Shellem merely freed four wrongly convicted people from prison in a period of 10 years with his reporting .
Oh , and in the 1990s he also brought down a Pennsylvania state attorney general in a mail fraud investigation .
Today that fallen attorney general , Ernie Preate , Jr. , has only praise for Shellem .
Shellem died unexpectedly last week at age 49 .
Described by a former colleague in a 2007 American Journalism Review profile as a " B - movie reporter — you know , a chain - smoking tough guy who meets his sources in bars and operates around the edges , " Shellem spent two decades covering the courts for the Harrisburg Patriot - News .
In the accounts of his passing , he 's described by colleagues and friends as the sort of reporter who read court transcripts , trial briefs , and lab reports for fun , whose office was filled with phone numbers scrawled on bar napkins and letters from desperate convicts proclaiming their innocence .
Between filing stories about murder trials and covering day - to - day court operations , Shellem developed and worked sources in Pennsylvania 's criminal justice system .
He also developed an eye for spotting irregularities in police reports , crime lab reports , witness statements , and other court documents .
That 's when he started helping innocent people get out of jail .
The first person Shellem 's reporting freed from prison was Patricia Carbone .
Carbone told police she 'd been abducted by a man named Jerome Lint , who Carbone says also attempted to rape her .
Carbone pulled a knife from her purse , and stabbed and killed Lint .
Prosecutors did n't believe Carbone 's story .
She was tried and convicted of murder , and sentenced to life in prison .
In his reporting , Shellem found another woman who had also been assaulted by Lint .
That led prosecutors to reopen Carbone 's case , and her eventual release from prison in 1998 .
Shellem 's reporting also tore holes in the state 's case against Steve Crawford , who was convicted of killing a friend at age 14 .
He spent 28 years in prison .
Shellem found new evidence supporting Crawford 's innocence , including evidence that a state crime lab report had been altered to incriminate Crawford .
Crawford too was eventually released .
In helping free Barry Laughman , a mentally - retarded man convicted of killing an 84 - year - old woman , Shellem tracked DNA in the case all the way to Leipzig , Germany .
Laughman was convicted in 1988 , before modern DNA testing .
Even Laughman 's own defense team had no idea what happened to the biological evidence taken from the crime scene , nor did they understand that locating the evidence could definitively establish their client 's guilt or innocence .
Shellem tracked the evidence to the then - Penn State University professor who analyzed it for Laughman 's trial , but had since moved to Germany .
He had taken the evidence with him .
When tested , it showed Laughman was not the man who committed the rape .
Finally there 's David Gladden , who was convicted of assaulting , murdering , and then setting fire to an elderly woman in 1995 .
In 2006 , based solely on his own reputation for exposing injustice , Shellem was able to convince Dauphin County District Attorney Edward M. Marsico , Jr. to reopen the case .
Shellem then showed not only that an informant in the case had lied ( the informant later recanted his testimony ) , but that the victim lived in the same building as a serial killer who killed his victims in the very same manner the woman had been murdered .
Gladden was released .
( Read Shellem 's cutting expose on Gladden 's case here . )
Preate , the former attorney general who did a year in prison because of Shellem 's reporting in the mid-1990s , now works for a prison reform organization .
He describes Shellem as a " one-man Innocence Project . "
" He busted my ass . . .
You 've got to recognize the work that he 's done and the value he 's given to society .
He was there when the justice system failed , " Preate says .
Quoted in his own paper , Patriot - News Executive Editor David Newhouse put Preate 's praise of Shellem in perspective .
" How many journalists gain the admiration not only of those they help but of those they expose ? "
In the age of fluffy politician profiles , moral - panic inducing magazine covers that spawn ill - considered legislation , and multi-part investigative series that practically scream out for handing more power over to government , Shellem was motivated by an understanding of the free press ' most important responsibility : to check the coercive power of the state .
" I was always taught that reporters are supposed to be government watchdogs , " Shellem told Philadelphia Inquirer reporter Mario Cattabiani , who wrote the 2007 profile of Shellem in the American Journalism Review .
" The most drastic thing the government can do to an individual is charge them with a crime and send them to jail .
We have a good justice system in this country , and it pisses me off to see people misuse it to run over people , most of whom are at some sort of disadvantage . "
" If people need to be embarrassed into doing the right thing , " Shellem added , " I 'm happy to oblige them . "
Shellem 's death was n't reported outside of Pennsylvania .
In fact , his work , incredible as it was , rarely made it outside the state .
As his editor John Kirkpatrick told Cattabani , if Shellem had worked for the Washington Post , he'd have been famous .
He 'd have a deskful of awards and a commenting gig on MSNBC .
But then , he'd no longer have been stalking the halls of Pennsylvania courthouses , either .
" He does n't care about that , " Kirkpatrick said in 2007 , explaining Shellem 's desire to stay in Harrisburg .
" He cares about righting these wrongs . "
I do n't particularly know or care what journalism — as defined by those pontificating on the future of the profession — needs right now .
But society needs more Pete Shellems .
Because there 's a seemingly endless supply of people in power in need of embarrassment .
Rest in peace .

Temasek Hedge highlights how these days Singapore 's port has become too quiet .
The Financial Times agrees .
Temasek Hedge :
These days , though , the view is obscured by hundreds of ships lying at anchor , some of them part of the estimated 10 per cent of the world container fleet idled due to lack of business .
At the ultra-modern Pasir Panjang container terminal , stacks of empty containers piled up behind protective fencing tell a similar story .
...
You can see it for yourself .
Just take a drive on the AYE / ECP , and note the number of crane “ birds ” that are standing up .
If they are up , it means they are idle .
Of course , FT notes that the silence is not just confined to Singapore .
All other ports are suffering too .
We should note that Dubai aims to be transhipment hub , a meeting point for goods before they are shipped to elsewhere , like Singapore .
The problem for cities like Singapore and Dubai though is that everyone wants to be a hub now .
Thus even a rebound in world container shipping trade , perhaps driven by a moderate recovery for the U.S. consumer , might not be enough to provide much container shipping growth to Singapore , because port capacity all over the world will have likely grown faster .
Ports will be undercutting each other .
Singapore is a far more sustainable model than Dubai , but it would n't take much to rock its relatively small economy .
A prolonged trade slump could be enough .
The picture above shows a recent snapshot of the ships sitting idle around Singapore .

Just do n't expect much action .
They are n't moving .
" In the Ubuntu 20.04 package base , the Chromium package is indeed empty and acting , without your consent , as a backdoor by connecting your computer to the Ubuntu Store . " zdnet.com/article/linux -…
In the actual filing , she explicitly states that the court either did n't read the original complaint or ( and get this ) is being controlled by , and in conspiracy with the executive branch .
Get a load of this language :
" The fact that Court 's 14 page order does not address any actual statements in Plaintiff 's complaint by page or paragraph number , or any page citation to her TRO , suggests to a reasonable and objective mind that the Court either did not read these documents or was summarily instructed by that same illegitimate " chain of command " alleged above not to address at least three key questions asserted in Plaintiff 's complaint ... "
and then it goes even deeper in accusing the Court of conspiracy by saying :
" The Court 's failure to address these three key issues again , standing alone , is suggestive that the executive branch is exercising control over the Court 's decision making process , and is sufficient ground , by itself , to justify this Court 's grant of an EMERGENCY STAY OF DEPLOYMENT for at least TEN DAYS ... "
So she is saying , in the actual Court filing , that the Court either is incompetent or is in conspiracy with the administration .
Wow .
Just plain wow .
If nothing else , this outta put her on the fast track to a serious fine , a court summons , disbarment , contempt of court charges and possibly even jail time .

When you are creating a website ( or hiring a web / blog designer to create one for you ) , there are specific items you need to be aware of .
Things that normally would n’t cross your mind .
For the average person who wants a website or blog for their business , they are after one very important thing – sales .
Now , they may tell you that they want the big flashy logos , or the overdone textures / gradients , but it is the job of a well skilled web designer to steer their clients in the right direction .
Below are twenty do ’s and don’ts of effective web design .
Study , read , ( re ) read and print this page .
It will help either make or break your website .
And do n’t hesitate to let us know of anything we might have left out , in the comments below .
We love getting your opinions on things and discussing the articles with you – after all , you ’re quite possibly the coolest people in the world .
DO : Keep your page structured
In the recent months we ’ve seen an explosion of great grid layouts and css files .
The most famous ( in my opinion ) being 960.gs and one of the cooler , more light weight grid systems being the 1 kb grid .
Following after the structure and balance of a great magazine / newspaper , these grid systems help lay out information in a structured and easy to follow format .
Example
DONT : Just place boxes everywhere
We ’ve all seen these types of websites before – 20 + boxes , all different sizes , nothing lining up properly and not on piece that actually grabs your attention because you ’ve just ran into a whirlwind of craziness .
if you ’re a web designer and you cannot properly place items in a structured environment , well , I would’t really call yourself a web designer .
DO : Focus on what ’s important
Are you building a website for a business that sells one specific product ?
If so , make sure that ’s the focus of the home page .
Allow yourself space on the inner pages to place calls to action for that specific item .
If you ’re building a blog that gives out freebies or writes tutorials , make sure they ’re getting the proper amount of focus and attention .
Websites like WOO
Themes do a great job and putting forward what their main focus is – wordpress themes .
Example
DONT : Place irrelevant ads across your page
If you ’re going to try and make money from your website / blog , do yourself a favor and lay off the excessive advertisements .
If your page loads and has 70 % ads and only 30 % content , odds are high that people will leave and never come back .
Making your ads the # 1 priority is a bad idea .
Try blending them in and making sure they do n’t take away from the content .
DO : Choose the right color scheme
Knowing what your readers emotions are will help you in choosing the proper color scheme .
You wo n’t want a bright and ‘ loud ’ color scheme if your website is in the meditation niche .
You ’ll notice that most punk rock bands have CMYK color schemes ( pink , yellow , black and blue ) , while a doctor / medical website will generally stick with a lighter , more ‘ open ’ color scheme
Example
DONT : Overdo it with 20 different colors
Having every color that is inside the 64 set of crayons on your screen will not only look bad , but it will annoy your readers and drive them away .
Your colors should blend well together , not clash .
If you ’re not good at picking color schemes , I ’d suggest a site like Colour Lovers which has user generated color schemes posted .
Find the right color scheme ( at most , 5 colors ) and see how much better your designs turn out .
DO : Make it easy to scan your pages
People will not spend 5 minutes trying to figure out what your website is about and what it has to offer .
The best way to ensure you ’re getting the right information out to your reader is to make the page easy to scan .
Use proper H tags ( similar to how this post is using h3 tags ) to focus on the important items .
You can also use pull quotes , block quotes and images .
Example
DONT : Write one paragraph per page that is 1,000 + words long
If there ’s one thing that stops me from subscribing to a blog is that the posts are literally 1,000 + words and have no paragraph breaks .
This , and they normally do n’t even have blog words or any indication that there ’s anything important inside their content .
Break your content up and make it easier to read – please , and thank you .
DO : Keep it simple stupid
It ’s a proven fact that sign up forms with more than 3 items ( usually – name , email & one other item ) will have a significantly lower sign up rate than the easier forms .
People HATE doing things for too long – so do n’t over complicate things .
Make things as easy as possible for your readers by pretending a 4 year old will be viewing it .
It definitely helps get things out in the open where they need to be .
Example
DONT : Go on and on ( and on ) about nothing
Rambling , excessive LOL ’s , too many smiley faces and random dribble will drop attention spans of your visitors .
You want them to stay – act like it .
If you have a personal blog where you write about your life , thats one thing , but to randomly post about what you ate , or where you went yesterday on your business website will definitely drive people away .
DO : Focus on killer copywriting
Words matter .
Keep them short , sweet and to the point .
If you have trouble writing copy that attracts the readers attention to where you need it to go , hire someone .
Copy is just as important as the design of your website .
Choosing the right words for sign up buttons , page headings , navigation items and calls to action can be the difference between 50 % sign up rate and a 90 % sign up rate .
Example
DONT : Stuff your pages full of keywords
Google is n’t stupid .
Neither are your readers .
If your page has the main keyword for your site stuffed into each paragraph 30 - 40 times , it will not only read very poorly , but you ’ll be penalized .
Writing should flow naturally and should only mention your keywords where they fit .
DO : Set your navigation up properly
If you ’ve got a sign up page on your website , maybe you ’ll have your main navigation in a blue color , while the sign up button is in a green color .
Regardless , you ’ll want to make your navigation easy to spot and easy to use .
Example
DONT : Make your readers search to find something
Your readers should n’t spend 30 - 40 seconds trying to find a contact or about page .
They also should n’t have to click through three pages just to get to a sign up form .
Get the important things out in the open .
For the items that are n’t required to have a strong focus on your website , you might want to invest in a search box – I HATE when websites do n’t have a search box .
Web design 101 maybe ?
DO : Optimize your load times
If there ’s one recurring theme in this entire article it is the fact that visitors are impatient .
You need to build your website with optimal speeds and allow your page to load in around 1 - 2 seconds .
You can do this by making sure your css files are compressed , using the google hosted javascript files and ensure your page is coded and designed with optimal speeds in mind .
Example
DONT : Make everything on your page an image
Text on a website is there to be exactly what it is - text .
There is no need to make the text blocks of your site jpg images .
Also , making your website background 1MB or more in size will also cause your page to load very slow .
I ’ve seen websites also use 2 different javascript libraries and load 10 + plugin scripts for them in the headers and their websites took around 20 seconds to fully load .
DO : Choose the right fonts and sizes
I ’ve only recently got into typography and have realized that it is a highly important aspect of web design .
Making your section titles the right size and making sure the fonts you ’re using will greatly effect the experience your visitors have when viewing your websites .
Generally speaking , you should use one main font for the content and then you may switch the titles of the pages to a different font .
Example
DONT : Have 5 different fonts in 10 different sizes
Picture this :
Page titles are in times new roman , content for those pages are in Arial , navigation links are in comic sans and the sidebar is in impact ( yes , that impact ) .
How ugly does that look ?
Now , remember that vision the next time you want to build a website with 5 different fonts .
DO : Make your page visually appealing
The world may tell you that people do n’t judge a book by its cover , but thats a lie .
The first thing people see is the web design you ’re branded with .
That first impression better be a good one .
Utilize textures / gradients that give your website depth and draw attention to the beauty of your design .
I would strive to ensure each of your website designs are accepted to galleries like css mania .
Example
DONT : Throw a bunch of crap together and think you ’ll do well
Animated gif ’s are your first no - no .
After that comes the marquee scrolling text and the jumbled mess of text and graphics that resemble a 13 year olds myspace page .
It is n’t cute and in case you ’re not aware of it , it ’s no longer 1980 .
Things have changed and people do n’t expect to see something that looks like a 7 year old made it .
If you ’re a professional , act like it and make sure your designs are up to par .
Here ’s where you come in
Below is a comment box .
We ’d love to have you use it and let us know what you think .
I ’ll even make sure I respond to any of your questions , because , lets face it – you ’re important to us here at Web Design Ledger .
Google plans to launch a music service , Wired.com has confirmed with sources familiar with the situation .
Next to nothing is known about the service at this point , rumored to be called " Google Music , " " Google Audio , " or " One Box , " although we have confirmed that it will be announced next Wednesday , and that it will link out to two music services : Lala and iLike .
Google will not become a music retailer itself , but will offer enhanced music search with a streaming function — first of possibly several vertical search offerings .
Searching for an artist or song will apparently bring up a box ( thus Google 's working title : " One Box " ) with a streaming link randomly assigned to stream songs from either Lala or iLike , the latter of which was acquired by MySpace in August .
Lala , iLike , " and others " will announce the service next Wednesday at Capital Records Music in Hollywood , California , with musical guests OneRepublic plus members of Linkin Park and Dead by Sunrise .
The RSVP on the invitation ( right ) links to an e-mail address at secure online event registration company Paragon New Media , which lists Google as a client .
After spotting that , we confirmed with a source close to the situation that Google 's upcoming music service will be announced at the event .
Google 's music search service , whatever it ends up being called , will include music from all four major labels and , most likely , all of the indie content on iLike and Lala ( as one insider put it , it would be harder to remove a subset of songs from those services than to let Google simply index all of it ) .
i Like currently streams some songs as 30 - second samples and others as full - length songs , and sells MP3s for the usual prices .
Lala allows registered users to stream complete songs and albums once , for free , after which point they can buy streaming songs 10 cents that can be credited to the purchase of the full download .
At this point , it 's not clear how these services will behave when presented through Google 's search interface .
Google has yet to respond to our requests for comment .
The company is also building the back - end for the majors ' upcoming Vevo music video service , and operates a free download service in China that TechCrunch says will not resemble whatever Google launches here in the U.S. and possibly elsewhere as well .
After this music search product launches next Wednesday , we understand that Google plans to release other search verticals , possibly including a travel booking service .

The MPAA is currently involved in legal battles against several BitTorrent sites .
Last year Hollywood 's lobby organization booked a victory in court when they managed to shut TorrentSpy down , but despite these efforts the studio bosses are still not satisfied .
Three of the MPAA 's anti-piracy leaders have now been fired .
Earlier this year we reported that MPAA President Dan Glickman is likely to be thrown out after his contract ends in 2010 .
Unlike his predecessor , Jack Valenti , who held the office for 38 years , the studio heads plan to ditch Glickman after just 6 years .
However , Glickman is not the only one to be critiqued by Hollywood ’s bosses .
Cnet reports that the MPAA has already fired three leaders of its anti-piracy operations .
The MPAA ’s general counsel Greg Goeckner has been told to leave at the end of the year , and their director of worldwide anti-piracy operations and the deputy director of Internet anti-piracy have also been fired .
Sources in the film industry said that the three were thrown out because the anti-piracy operations of the MPAA were unsatisfactory , and “ lacked aggressiveness . ”
The MPAA ’s anti-piracy division will not cease its activities though , but in addition to the layoffs it will remove the term ‘ anti- piracy ’ from its name and replace it with ‘ content protection ’ .
Under their new name they will continue to go after the BitTorrent site is oHunt – whose owner they promised to hunt down for life – and other sites they believe are a cause of movie industry losses .
Unlike the RIAA , the MPAA has refrained from going after individual downloaders , and thus far there has been no indication that this will change anytime soon .
Legal battles aside , the main task of the MPAA will be to lobby for tougher anti-piracy legislation , a role that is now mostly fulfilled by music industry trade groups such as the BPI and IFPI .
The current layoffs are most likely the result of the rapidly increasing piracy rate of movies .
However , instead of changing their name and replacing a few heads , the movie studio bosses have to consider whether legislating and lobbying is the right move to beat piracy .
Maybe they should consider adapting to the digital era by making it easy for consumers to download legally at reasonable prices .
Jeffrey Stern ’s mother wanted him to have every advantage — from his schooling at Manhattan ’s prestigious Dalton School to summer camp in the Berkshires .
So when Jeffrey , at age 11 and 4 - foot - 1 , was a full foot shorter than everyone else in his class , she talked to an endocrinologist , who put him on human growth hormone .
“ The doctors said that he was destined to be taller , ” Margot Stern said .
Jeffrey now stands 5 - foot - 7 , but that ’s not tall enough for the 16 - year - old and his mother .
“ They said that the height that ’s owed to him is around 5 - foot - 8 or 5 - foot - 10 , ” she said .
“ I was going to give him a chance to achieve his growth potential . ”
Jeffrey is just one of at least six sophomores at the private Dalton School taking Humatrope , a designer drug for preteens that some experts call “ Miracle - Gro for kids . ”
The growth hormones — which are shockingly easy to get — are being used increasingly by wealthy parents looking to give their children a leg up , literally , experts say .
The trend comes thanks to a 2003 change in Food and Drug Administration regulations .
Officials ruled that growth hormones were acceptable for any child who falls into the 1.2 percentile of height for their age .
Before this , only children with rare medical conditions — such as human growth deficiency or Turner ’s syndrome — were considered eligible for treatment .
The average American man is 5 - foot - 8 , and 5 - foot - 3 is considered the bottom of the normal range , according to the Centers for Disease Control .
Sales of Humatrope , the most widely prescribed growth hormone , shot up 40 percent in 2004 .
In 2007 , manufacturer Eli Lilly reported $ 440 million in sales for the drug — a 6 percent increase from the year before .
Shortness now is seen as a treatable condition , and parents , without accounting for genetic predisposition , are taking their kids ’ height into their own hands .
The trend does not sit well with health insurers .
Aetna covered Jeffrey ’s treatments for the last four years , but in April , when his mother changed policies , the company refused to cover the $ 2,400 - a- month shots .
Aetna no longer looked at the 5 - foot - 7 soccer player ’s condition as a growth - hormone deficiency .
It now considers his diagnosis to be “ short stature , ” which it does n’t cover .
Jeffrey ’s mother insists her son suffers from a medical condition .
She ’s taking Aetna to court in Manhattan to force them to continue the coverage .
“ Aetna has medically inhibited Jeffrey Stern ’s puberty for two years , and then acting as ‘ God , ’ determined that his growth would stop on April 1 , 2009 , ” she claims in court papers .
But medical experts question the ethics and effectiveness of such treatments .
“ It ’s outrageous , ” said Dr. Alan Rogol , a professor at the University of Virginia Hospital who specializes in growth and development .
“ We ’re struggling to get kids up to 5 feet .
Only in New York on the Upper East Side . ”
He said he doubts there will be any benefit to continued treatment .
Rogol said Humatrope usually adds only one or two inches to a child ’s growth .
“ I can certainly see where the insurance company is coming from , ” he said .
The growth spurt Jeffrey enjoyed after taking the drugs did not go unnoticed by his classmates ’ parents .
“ After Jeffrey grew taller than some of the kids in his class , other mothers called me , ” Margot Stern said .
“ Three kids went on it as a direct result of Jeffrey .
I think it has something to do with competition , but others were just concerned . ”
In Jeffrey ’s sophomore class of about 120 students , there are six students taking the drug , Stern said .
Statistically speaking , that ’s five times the norm if you use the FDA ’s “ 1.2 percentile ” rule as a guide .
But doctors often disregard FDA guidelines and prescribe the hormone “ off label ” to families concerned about their kids ’ height .
HGH side effects include headaches , glucose intolerance and hip problems .
The long - term risks are still a mystery .
“ It ’s one thing if your kid has a life - threatening illness , but what ’s the threat if your kid is short ? ” said Susan Cohen , author of “ Normal at Any Cost : Tall Girls , Short Boys and the Medical Industry ’s Quest to Manipulate Height . ”
“ We would urge a little more humility in the doctors and caution in the parents .
No medication is risk - free . ”
Stern insists Jeffrey ’s treatments are not about appearances .
“ A lot of people think that this is just superficial , but there was clearly something wrong with his hormones , ” she said .
From the ages 7 to 11 , Jeffrey barely grew .
His shoe size in the first grade was the same as his shoe size in the fifth grade .
On a summer camp field trip to a New Jersey amusement park , he stood in line for nearly half an hour with his friends for a roller coaster , only to be told he was too short to ride .
“ I waited in line for 25 minutes just so the lady could tell me that I could n’t get on the ride , ” Jeffrey recalled .
Margot Stern took Jeffrey to two endocrinologists , who ran tests and determined that at the rate his bones were growing , he would not make it to 5 feet .
Mount Sinai Dr. Madeleine Harbison prescribed two drugs .
The first , Lupron , delayed Jeffrey ’s puberty so his bones would not age and harden .
The second , Humatrope , stimulated growth .
Doctors can determine Jeffrey ’s “ growth potential ” through regular X - rays that show his “ bone age . ”
With these X - rays , they can predict how much longer his bones will grow before they fuse and harden .
“ I realize that people are going to hate me because he ’s 5 - foot - 7 , but when you ’ve been through what we ’ve been through , you want to see it through , ” Stern said .
Stern pointed to a pencil mark on the closet door in Jeffrey ’s room .
“ I put 6 feet on the wall just to be hopeful , ” she said .

Students that are most likely to succeed in college and work hard enough to get a degree have nothing to do with the high school they attended or the SAT score they received .
Most likely , college graduates earned at least B's in high school .
They also strove to attend the best college they could get into .
Researchers have been studying educational records since 1999 and have discovered that 44 percent of undergrads are dropping out .
This means America could be in danger of losing its competitiveness to other countries .
High school grades are the biggest predictor of whether students will do well in college , according to studies .
It does n't matter how easy or difficult the grading system is at the college .
It measures their ability to get their homework and projects done .
This shows that they have the ability and stamina to complete a degree program .
Another factor shows that many capable , intelligent students apply only to lower ranked colleges .
In these schools , they tend to be above average and are n't really challenged .
These are called the safe schools , and many students are far more likely to drop out than other brilliant students that got into higher ranked , challenging schools .
For example , 58 percent of students that earn between a 3.0 and 3.3 GPA ended up graduating from college whereas , 47 percent of students graduated that earned below those marks .
The more students learned motivation , good study habits , time management skills , and opposition , the more likely they were to complete a college degree .
Students that have these skills and are bright should go to a four - year university .
They may want to save money by going to a community college , but the dropout rates will be higher .
If you can get into a good school , then that is where you should go for the entire four years .
Plus , remaining at the same school for the entire four years saves many students because they do n't lose credits when they transfer to a different school .
Some colleges also have higher graduation rates than others .
Generally , students that live on campus and are in honors courses are more likely to graduate because they are more involved and invested in their schooling .
Some students that have not done well in school are students from low - income backgrounds .
Even though there are tons of programs and scholarships that help these students go to school , they usually have lower chances of educational success .
If they are the first in their families to go to college , they typically do n't stay .
Researchers have discovered that demographic factors like gender , race , parent education , and socioeconomic status play an important role in determining a student ’s fate regardless of how smart or motivated the students is .
Minorities and low income students are failing and dropping out at increasing rates , especially when they 're compared with students with similar grades from other backgrounds .
Unfortunately , wealth and family history do play a role in students ’ chances of graduating .
Wealthy undergrads are 11 percent more likely to earn degrees than comparable students from the poorest economic quartile .
There needs to be increasing efforts to keep our students from dropping out of schools .
The country is not getting enough highly educated workers , and the more people drop out the more likely their children will do the same .
It ’s an unfortunate , perpetuating cycle .
Well , this is shaping up to be one of the biggest disasters in the history of cloud computing , and certainly the largest blow to Danger and the Sidekick platform : T - Mobile 's now reporting that personal data stored on Sidekicks has " almost certainly has been lost as a result of a server failure at Microsoft / Danger . "
They 're still looking for a way to recover it , but they 're not giving users a lot of hope -- meanwhile , servers are still on the fritz and customers are being advised not to let their devices power down because anything that 's still on there will be lost the next time the device is turned on .
Another communique is promised from T - Mobile on Monday to give everyone a status update on the recovery efforts , but at this point , it 's not looking good at all .
Apparently T- Mobile has paused the sale of new Sidekicks , as all models are now listed as " temporarily out of stock " on the company 's site .
Additionally , a warning as been added to the post on T - Mobile 's forum which reads : " Sidekick customers , during this service disruption , please DO NOT remove your battery , reset your Sidekick , or allow it to lose power . "
Scary stuff , Sidekickers .

Here are some more reasons why you really do need a lawyer .
Making Sure the Arrest was Done Properly
When you are arrested there are rules and procedures that the police need to adhere to .
Your lawyer will go over the arrest to verify that any breath tests were lawfully administered before they arrested you .
If you were not given a proper breath test or your rights were violated and it can be proven then there is a chance that your case can be thrown out of court .
Here are some of the things he will look out for .
Choosing the Best Option for Your Case
Sometimes your best option when you are facing a DUI charge is to plead guilty .
There may be the option to reduce the charges in exchange for a guilty plea , but the best person to evaluate the situation is your attorney .
They are familiar with the prosecutor , the judges and the ramifications of your situation .
Without an attorney the prosecution will encourage you to take the maximum penalty when it is n’t necessary .
Which brings us to the next point .
Minimal Impact on Your Future
When it comes to a DUI conviction it is n’t just losing your driving license you need to worry about .
DUI are taken seriously by the courts and you can face jail time along with some pretty hefty fines .
The final cost of a DUI conviction can run in the thousands of dollars .
The right attorney can help to minimize the cost , reduce the amount of jail time and damage that come with a conviction .
Defending You in Court
Lastly , if you decide to fight your DUI charges then you will need a DUI attorney to defend you in a court of law .
The will zealously defend your rights and prove your innocence in court .
They will review the facts presented by the prosecution and argue for the best possible outcome .
Do n’t think for a moment that a DUI is n’t serious or that you can defend yourself .
A good lawyer specializing in DUI cases is what you need .
Health Canada has informed provinces and territories it expects the supply of H1N1 vaccine being shipped across Canada to be lower next week because of a bottleneck in the production line .
GlaxoSmithKline Inc. , which is producing the Canadian order of 50.4 million doses at its plant in Ste - Foy , Que. , told Health Canada that it had to use one of its production lines to make a special adjuvant - free version of the vaccine for expectant mothers .
" This resulted in reduced adjuvanted vaccine availability next week , " Tim Vail , director of communications for Health Minister Leona Aglukkaq , said in a statement late Thursday .
The version of the vaccine that does not contain an adjuvant – an additive that stretches supply and boosts immunity – was ordered for expectant mothers because there is no clinical data available on the effect of the adjuvant in pregnant women .
The vaccine containing an adjuvant is for the rest of the population .
" ( GlaxoSmithKline ) assures us that they will be back up to providing ( provinces and territories ) with millions of doses the following week , " Vail said .
" We continue working closely with both ( GlaxoSmithKline ) and provinces and territories to ensure all Canadians who want to be vaccinated will be been immunized by Christmas .
We remain on track to meet this goal . "
Vail noted the government expects to have delivered six million doses of the vaccine across the country by the end of this week , which he said is more vaccine per capita than anywhere else in the world .
Vail said more than 2.2 million doses have been sent to Ontario so far .
" This is the first week of one of the largest mass immunization campaigns in Canadian history , " Vail said .
" We ask Canadians to be patient while those who need the vaccine most , get it first . "
Meanwhile , Bridgepoint Health is dealing with a confirmed H1N1 outbreak with 11 patients and five health - care professionals at one unit of the hospital .
The affected people are being treated with antiviral medication , and staff and patients at the unit are receiving antivirals and the H1N1 vaccine , the hospital announced in a press release .

Planet Fedora
In this section , we cover the highlights of Planet Fedora [ 1 ] - an aggregation of blogs from Fedora contributors worldwide .
Contributing Writer : Adam Batkin
General
Gerard Braad installed [ 1 ] the Maemo 5 SDK on Fedora 12 .
However , there were a few minor quirks with the installation process to be aware of .
Steven Moix compared [ 2 ] the Maemo platform ( Nokia N900 ) with Android ( Hero ) .
Richard W.M. Jones decided to take a look [ 3 ] into the Fedora and Ubuntu Live CDs to see if it was possible " to quickly create a Fedora or Ubuntu “ all - defaults ” virtual machine . "
Part 2 continues [ 4 ] with some optimization that drastically reduce the time taken to install ( one 16 minutes operation in particular ends up taking 2 1/2 minutes after optimization ) .
Andrew Overholt announced [ 5 ] release 0.4.0 of the Eclipse Linux Tools , complete with SystemTap call graphs , GProf integration and better autotools support .
John Palmier explained [ 6 ] " why do we care about push messaging " ?
( in the form of a comic strip ) .
This is all in preparation for a presentation on AMQP and qpid for the upcoming FUDCon .
Karsten Wade discussed [ 7 ] " building a business around sustainable open source engineering " .
Karsten wanted to " lay out a definition for sustainable open source engineering , provide some examples you may not have thought of , and find out who else is doing a good job at it ( or trying to , at the very least ! ) "
Mike McGrath says [ 8 ] : " I 'm happy to announce today we finally have context based sponsorship listings .
What does this mean ?
Well , when you go to http://fedoraproject.org/
you end up hitting one of several reverse proxy servers .
These hosts are located all over the world by different hosting providers . "
Pavol Rusnak took a look [ 9 ] at community engagement in the OpenSUSE and Fedora communities .
Many pie graphs ensued .
Ray Strode talked [ 10 ] about the point in the bootup process where it transitions from Plymouth to X. " f you have n’t seen it , when boot up finishes , plymouth settles down the boot splash to a transitionable animation frame , then the mouse pointer shows up , and GDM ’s background cross fades in while the login window maps and expands to show frequently logged in users .
In the best case , this transition all happens without any flicker , resolution changes , black intermediate screens , or console text showing up . "
QualityAssurance
In this section , we cover the activities of the QA team [ 1 ] .

Test Days
There was no Test Day last week , and no Test Day is currently planned for this week .
If you would like to propose a main track Test Day for the Fedora 13 cycle , please contact the QA team via email or IRC , or file a ticket in QA Trac [ 1 ] .
Weekly meetings
The QA group weekly meeting [ 1 ] was held on 2009 - 11 - 23 .
The full log is available [ 2 ] .
James Laska noted that a common bugs page entry had been added [ 3 ] to cover the known issue with preupgrade and free space in the / boot partition , and Rui He had been working to update the preupgrade test cases to catch similar problems in future [ 4 ] .
James Laska admitted that he had not yet sent out the request for feedback for the Fedora 12 QA retrospective , but promised to do it soon .
John Poelstra asked whether the group would be interested in a project - wide retrospective at the upcoming FUDCon ; James offered to discuss the idea with John after the meeting .
The group discussed the question of privilege escalation testing , following the PackageKit installation permission controversy [ 5 ] .
James Laska wanted to discuss the plan Tom ' spot ' Callaway had proposed via a blog post [ 6 ] and create a test plan based around it .
Adam Williamson felt it was too early to begin planning testing , since Tom 's blog post was only a proposal , and there was no official policy or guideline for privilege escalation issues on which a test plan could be based .
Adam was also worried about defining the scope of testing , as checking every package in the distribution would be impractical given the size of the QA team .
The group agreed that for any useful testing to be done , two things would be needed : a project - wide policy or set of policies and guidelines , and a tool for generating a list of packages which are capable of privilege escalation .
Adam agreed to start a discussion of this on the development and security mailing lists .
Will Woods offered to work on the tool for identifying escalation - capable packages .
James Laska brought up John Poelstra 's plan to improve the release criteria [ 7 ] , and asked the group to provide feedback .
John noted that he was hoping people could get together to work on finalizing the new criteria at FUDCon .
Will Woods and Kamil Paral reported on the progress of the AutoQA project .
Will had completed the redesign of the autoqa code to be based around a Python shared library containing functions commonly used in multiple watchers and tests .
The new post - koji - build test hook is also included , and autoqa is currently running an rpmlint test on every Koji build to test the hook .
He said the next objective was to solidify the post - koji - build hook , help package maintainers add post - build tests , and get the rpmguard test running .
A later objective is to work on a post - bodhi- update hook and dependency check test so that all updates submitted to Bodhi will be checked for dependency consistency , to hopefully end the situation where updates are pushed which break dependency chains .
Kamil had been working on the Wiki documentation , and had created a new front page [ 8 ] which briefly explains the project and contains links to the most important relevant pages .
He also pointed out that James Laska had been drafting further improvements to this page [ 9 ] .
Jesse Keating proposed a talk during FUDCon to explain how several new ideas across the release engineering and QA groups - no frozen rawhide , autoqa , autosigning , and new milestones - would fit together in upcoming Fedora release cycles .
The group thought this was a good idea , and Jesse said he would take the lead in arranging it .
The Bugzappers group weekly meeting [ 10 ] was held on 2009 - 11 - 24 .
The full log is available [ 11 ] .
The group discussed housekeeping tasks , particularly updating the components and triagers page [ 12 ] .
Adam Williamson thought the list of triagers should be kept ( rather than being emptied as was previously the case with each new release ) but pruned , with triagers known to be inactive being removed .
Edward Kirk volunteered to look into a method for updating the component list , based on the current critical path package list .
The group then discussed the topic of mentoring new members , with Edward Kirk encouraging experienced group members to help mentor new ones to make sure they got a good start on their triaging careers .
He also thought it would be good for existing members to join in welcoming new members to the group when they posted their introduction emails .
Adam Williamson suggested doing this via private mail to avoid cluttering up the list .
Matej Cepl brought up a problem related to the recently - implemented change in the method of marking bugs that had been triaged .
He had found that the fact that this was now being done differently for different releases made it impossible to construct a Bugzilla search for all triaged or un - triaged bugs in a given component across all releases .
To address this problem , he proposed adding the new Triaged keyword to all bugs in ASSIGNED state for existing supported releases ( Fedora 10 through 12 ) , which would allow searches to be performed using the keyword in all releases .
The group could see no problems with this idea , as long as it was done without generating a large amount of email , and approved the plan for Matej to approach the Bugzilla maintainer for help in implementing it .
Matej Cepl pointed out that the level of duplicate bugs being filed via the abrt [ 13 ] automated bug reporting tool was increasing the triage workload on some components significantly .
After a long discussion , the group agreed a plan to try and address this .
Will Woods would talk to the abrt team about the idea of reporting issues to an intermediate , abrt- specific server rather than directly to Bugzilla , based on the kerneloops.org [ 14 ] model .
Matej would talk to the abrt team about their plans to improve abrt's own automatic duplicate detection and about having abrt format its reports in ways that would aid triagers in manual duplicate detection .
Adam Williamson would respond to the existing thread on the development mailing list about the problem to raise the group 's concerns , and ask the abrt team whether future improvements to abrt 's duplicate detection logic could be retrospectively applied to bugs already filed by older versions of abrt .
The next QA weekly meeting will be held on 2009 - 11 - 30 at 1600 UTC in # fedora - meeting , and the next Bugzappers weekly meeting on 2009 - 12-01 at 1500 UTC in # fedora - meeting .
Increasing the grub timeout
Scott Robbins started a long thread [ 1 ] with the suggestion to increase the default timeout for the Fedora boot loader from its current default setting of 0 ( which causes the boot loader menu never to be shown at all ) .
There were many opinions on this idea , but the general response was positive enough for Scott to file a feature request [ 2 ] on the idea , where some compromises were suggested .
Richard Ryniker suggested having the system detect unclean shutdowns and force the boot menu to be displayed on the next boot ( much as Windows does ) .
Stewart Adam suggested having grub initially installed with a non -zero timeout , and have firstboot change it to zero on the assumption that a system that can get to firstboot must have a properly configured bootloader .
Fedora 12 QA retrospective
James Laska posted a request [ 1 ] for feedback on the Fedora 12 QA cycle from anyone , both on things that went well and areas that could be improved .
Many group members posted replies , including Adam Williamson [ 2 ] , Jóhann Guðmundsson [ 3 ] , and Rahul Sundaram [ 4 ] .

Fedora 12 Security Advisories
Fedora 11 Security Advisories
By Jonathan Fildes
Technology reporter , BBC News
More than 30,000 account details have been posted online Google 's web - based e-mail system , Gmail , has been targeted as part of an " industry - wide phishing scheme " .
The firm said that it had immediately safeguarded the affected accounts .
BBC
News has seen two lists that detail more than 30,000 names and passwords from e-mail providers , including Yahoo and AOL , which were posted online .
The lists also include details of thousands of Microsoft Hotmail users .
Google said fewer than 500 of its accounts had been affected by the scam .
However , the search giant revealed that it had discovered a third list , but would not say how many accounts it showed .
Phishing involves using fake websites to lure people into revealing data such as bank account details or login names .
" We recently became aware of an industry - wide phishing scheme through which hackers gained user credentials for web - based mail accounts including Gmail accounts , " said a Google spokesperson .
" As soon as we learned of the attack , we forced password resets on the affected accounts .
We will continue to force password resets on additional accounts when we become aware of them . "
The firm stressed that the scam was " not a breach of Gmail security " but rather " a scam to get users to give away their personal information to hackers " .
' Industry problem '
The phishing scam was originally thought to target just Hotmail users .
It was brought to light when 10,000 Hotmail addresses were posted online at Pastebin , a website commonly used by developers to share code .
The list was reported by technology blog Neowin .
However , a second list of 20,000 names has since emerged containing e-mail addresses and passwords from Hotmail , Yahoo , AOL , Gmail and other service providers .
A third list , which has not been seen by the BBC , was discovered by Google .
This should be a wake - up call to Google and Microsoft to educate their users
Carole Theriault
Security consultant
Phishing attack targets Hotmail Some of the accounts on the list of 20,000 names appear to be old , unused or fake .
However , BBC News confirmed that many - including Gmail , Yahoo and Hotmail addresses - were genuine .
Other addresses on the list include Comcast and Earthlink accounts .
It is not clear whether the new lists was part of the same phishing attack that collected the Hotmail addresses or a separate scam .
A spokesperson for Microsoft said phishing was an " industry - wide problem " .
" Our guidance to customers is to exercise extreme caution when opening unsolicited attachments and links from both known and unknown sources , and that they install and regularly update their anti-virus software . "
Both lists can still be accessed online .
A spokesperson for Yahoo urged consumers to " take measures to secure their accounts whenever possible , including changing their passwords " .
Carole Theriault of security firm Sophos agreed .
" Getting access to one password can give someone access to lots of things , " she said .
People should change their password on any other site where they use it , she added .
A recent report by the firm said that around 40 % of people had the same password for every website they used .
" People need to see a difference between an online bank account and booking cinema tickets online , " she told BBC News .
But , she said , blame did not rest with the users of the e-mail services , who most likely clicked on a link in a scam message .
" Phishing attacks are very subtle these days , " she said .
" People do all kinds of tricky things . "
Fake websites , which ask for a user 's login details , can be made to look like those of reputable companies .
" This should be a wake - up call to Google and Microsoft to educate their users , " said Ms Theriault .

Legislating Wall Street
We were sifting through the proposed “ too big to fail ” legislation that ’s floating around the House and found this nugget : Under Barney Frank ’s plan , the legislation would establish a “ Financial Services Oversight Council . ”
Essentially , it would be a group of bureaucrats who decide what companies are too big to fail and what new regulations / capital requirements they must subsequently observe .
The proposed voting members :
The secretary of the Treasury , who shall serve as the chairman of the council
The chairman of the Board of Governors of the Federal Reserve System
The comptroller of the currency
The director of the Office of Thrift Supervision
The chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission
The chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading Commission
The chairperson of the Federal Deposit Insurance Corp
The director of the Federal Housing Finance Agency
The chairman of the National Credit Union Administration .
In other words , all the people who never saw the crisis coming ( and a few who enabled it ) would sit on a council together and have to arbitrarily decide who gets to grow and who does n’t … just when innovation in the financial markets is needed most .
Brilliant .
“ Mark Warner , the junior senator from Virginia and one of the architects of the Oversight Council idea spoke to a group of financial publishers gathered at the Motley Fool in Alexandria , Va. , on Friday , ” writes Addison Wiggin , who was at the meeting himself .
“ Warner said he and his colleagues were working on the most sweeping and comprehensive reform bill since the 1930s , when the SEC itself was created . ”
“ The reform effort is focused on four fronts :
a) The council on “ Too Big To Fail ” ( named above )
b ) Increased capital requirements and strident guidelines ( for speculative gambling instruments )
c ) Increased funding and authority for the Resolution trust ( so at least the lawyers wo n’t go bust )
d ) and consumer protection ( for those dimwits who got in over their heads in the first place ) .
“ The parentheses , of course , are all ours . ”
“ The most striking thing to me , ” Addison continues , “ was not that Warner was basically describing a massive land grab on regulatory authority stemming from Washington … that ’s a given , especially since so much taxpayer money is being thrown down the money hole created by Wall Street .
“ What was really shocking was how candid Warner was .
He ’s a co-founder of Nextel , so he , unlike many politicians , has a basic understanding of business and entrepreneurship .
When he joined the Senate Finance Committee , he immediately rose to a position of respect and leadership within the group .
He said he ‘ puffed up his chest ’ and was proud they all thought he ‘ had a handle on all this banking stuff . ’
Then he realized , without much practical experience in banking , finance or crafting legislation , he found himself leading one of the most aggressive revamps of the financial system ever attempted in history . ”
“ ‘ Well , ’ Warner concluded after a quick Q&A session , ‘ That ’s all I have for you today .
I hope we do n’t screw this legislation up too badly for you . ’ ”
Uh .
Saul Hansell , reporting for the NYT :
Cellphone makers that have used Windows Mobile to run their top - of - the- line smartphones — including Samsung , LG , Kyocera , Sony Ericsson — are now also making Android devices .
Twelve Android handsets have been announced this year , with dozens more expected next year .
Motorola has dropped Windows Mobile from its line entirely in a switch to Android .
HTC , a major cellphone maker , expects half its phones sold this year to run Android .
Dell is using Android for its entry into the cellphone market .
This is actually sugarcoating it for Microsoft .
HTC is n’t merely “ a major cellphone maker ” — HTC is the single biggest maker of Windows Mobile phones .
Just eight months ago , Microsoft revealed that despite having 50 handset “ partners ” , HTC was responsible for over 80 percent of Windows Mobile phone sales .
Indeed , a J. D. Power & Associates survey found that Windows Mobile had the lowest satisfaction rating among customers of any smartphone operating system .
The iPhone has by far the most satisfying software , the study found .
Android is a distant second , followed closely by BlackBerry ’s operating system .
Windows Mobile scored below average on every attribute , said Kirk Parsons , director of the study , especially in ease of operation , speed and stability .
I love that “ especially ” .
Other than that , Mrs. Lincoln , how did you like the play ?

" I just started asking the question , ' Why ?
Why am I being treated this way after trying to better myself ? ' " said Nichols , 32 , who was twice convicted of indecent liberties with a teen girl and again for attempted second - degree rape .
" The law gives you no room to better yourself . "
On September 22 , UN Secretary Ban ki-Moon launched a challenge : " Use your voice as a global citizen and tell these leaders in a short video what you think needs to be done to make this world a better and safer place .
Be a Citizen Ambassador to the UN . "
" I want us both to agree to say one true thing out loud everyday .
To remember one real person .
To remind ourselves that our tragedies — yours and mine — are lived and felt one person at a time ; just like our hope , our renewal , our future can also be lived and carried out into the world , one person at a time .
You have a chance to be that person . "
Photographer , videographer , ...
What are you now ?
Emily :
From the narrative in the video , it seems you are not only good in visuals , but also in wording it .
Emily :
And then comes the humanitarian aspect ..
Emily :
And then came this video you made for the UN .
What message did you try to bring ?
Emily :
So what 's next ?
Emily :
It was one of five selected out of more than 450 screened by top leaders at the UN .
As a result of winning the contest , Emily will be named a " UN Citizen Ambassador " , get to travel to New York to attend the UN Day Concert , and meet Secretary General Ban ki-Moon .
So , time to have another chat with Emily : The lines are blurring between the photographer and the videographer .
Which for me , opens up the possibility to create really robust narratives .
I 'm still just a baby in this process , my work leans more towards automated slideshows , but in the future , I expect more and more online articles to contain video instead of still shots .
People who know me , know that I began my career as a writer through poetry .
And even at a young age , was very successful at that .
The study and craft of poetry taught me a lot about how to draw a line from complex intellectual constructs into emotion .
Humanitarian work is considered the next frontier for me .
There is a tremendous need for high quality communications tools that also maximize the potential of the internet to bring people together around important issues .
Although I have a Master 's Degree in Public Policy , it was really through my blog that I really learned how to talk to people about complicated issues .
In 2005 , I traveled to Iraq while conducting research for my graduate thesis on democracy .
While there , I witnessed the first post - Saddam elections and emailed my friends about what I saw and how it made me feel .
I had no idea that the emails would be more important than the thesis , but somehow , I managed to tell real stories about people I met and the lives that touched mine .
From those early emails , I created my blog : who we are / how we live , and really started to embrace an unusual avocation -- to write and talk about complicated problems in a personal way .
I tried never to forget my original audience : my little sister , my mom , policy wonks , colleagues .
For this project , I genuinely asked myself , " What do * I * want to say to world leaders ? "
I knew I did n't want to put forward any particular policy or opinion , but instead , to call on them , and all of us , to connect with something true and real .
To think less about politics and more about people , actual people that we know .
I think this is something humanitarian workers in the field do regularly .
When they talk about Iraq , they tell stories about people they know there .
When they talk about hunger , they tell stories about hungry people .
It 's a subtle but profound shift in thinking .
Through this video , and all of my work , I hope to remind myself and others that power is personal .
Real change is only created by hope and empathy , by strength and commitment , by listening to others and acknowledging that quiet voice , in my own heart , telling me what needs to be done .
For now , my professional goals as a writer and photographer are just to get better at what I 'm doing and learn more .
I have some local projects planned here in Baltimore and DC , but I 'm hoping to head back to Africa in the winter .
I 'm always looking for interesting projects and people to collaborate with .

Pete Rose Girlfriend Kiana Kim Playboy Bound ( PHOTOS )
Pete Rose , former MLB player and manager , has been seen recently with a new girlfriend .
He has shared a few details about her but has withheld her name , which continues to be a closely guarded secret until now .
Meet Kiana Kim .
We know that the Asian beauty is vivacious and statuesque .
Pete indicates she is a graduate of Arizona State , and previously served as a flight attendant for Korean Airlines .
Rose , 68 , apparently talked the dark haired beauty into auditioning for Playboy .
Pete said , " My girl has finally decided to try to shoot for Playboy , and they were kind enough to give her an opportunity to come to Houston for an interview , and we 're excited about that .
She 's beautiful , she 's young , educated -- there 's a lot of qualities .
She is very intelligent and just a really sweet girl .

WASHINGTON  A new report by the top commander in Afghanistan detailing the deteriorating situation there confronts President Obama with the politically perilous decision of whether to deepen American involvement in the eight - year - old war amid shrinking public support at home .
The classified assessment submitted Monday by Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , who took over American and NATO forces in Afghanistan in June , did not request additional American troops , American officials said , but they added that it effectively laid the groundwork for such a request in coming weeks .
While details of the report remained secret , the revised strategy articulated by General McChrystal in recent public comments would invest the United States more extensively in Afghanistan than it has been since American forces helped topple the Taliban government following the attacks of Sept. 11 , 2001 .
Taking a page from the 2007 strategy shift in Iraq , he has emphasized protecting civilians over just engaging insurgents .
For Mr. Obama , who already ordered an additional 21,000 troops to Afghanistan this year , the prospect of a still larger deployment would test his commitment to a war he did not launch even as it grows more violent by the month .

Topics
Preparedness or survival , whatever you want to call it .
Preparedness seem to be more politically correct , but its still about taking measures and planning for likely or not so likely problems and emergencies before they actually occur .
A lifestyle , a certain mindset makes for a true survivalist , and even though it starts with a little spark , the survival bug biting you , whether its going to change your life for the better or be just another thing you eventually loose interest on , only time will tell .
I get that question asked a lot and yesterday it was asked yet again .
“ OK , I get it but where do I start ?
What do I do ?
” Understanding the logic behind preparedness is the first step .
An economic crisis is about economics , but much more too .
You need to ensure a source of steady income , maybe become self employed if the job market does n’t offer anything for you , but its also about much worse crime , failing institutions that can’t keep running because of costs , just to mention a couple .
What does education has to do with an economic collapse ?
There ’s no money to pay teachers , so they go on strikes , hours get reduced , and the quality of education drops like a rock .
What does power shortages got to do with an economic collapse ?
No money , no maintenance , inflation makes prices go up , people can’t pay the bills , therefore maintenances suffers , soon power transformers start blowing up in summer , and the entire grid just gets patched here and there .
I ’m no Nostredamus , just saying what happened here and at some levels is already happening in USA .
When you prepare for a real economic collapse , you have to prepare for pretty much all aspects of modern survival .
Important , ca n’t emphasize enough the importance of self defense when economic hardships translate into much higher local crime rater .
Its already happening and trust me on this , its going to get worse .
Not the end of the world or anything , but for sure , much higher crime than you are used to .
Do n’t get caught with your guard down in this regard .
Which gun ?
For a total newbie that wont be shooting much : A 38 special snubby ( revolver with a 2 ” or 3 ” barrel ) for last resort close range self defense .
Newbie that will be taking this a bit more serious : Glock 19 , 9 mm .
Best gun in my opinion for self defense , for someone that will take it serious and is willing to put some more time and money into it : Glock 31 .
Glock 22 in 40S&W is good as well and you can fire both caliber in either gun , just buying a spare barrel .
While gear and supplies are n’t as important as mindset , you do need a certain amount .
Right away let me tell you this , there ’s an entire industry of survival toys , gear and gadgets , most of which you do n’t need , so do n’t spend a fortune , buy what you need and SAVE as much money as you can .
Why do I mention guns before anything else ?
Because if you do n’t own one it should be a top priority for you , buying it AND learning to shoot it in self defense .
People that prepare usually have enough food , yet I ’d say that 9 out of 10 underestimate the water issue .
It ’s not just drinking , its washing the dishes , flushing the toilets , washing your hands , taking a bucket bath and I ’m not even talking about washing clothes .
At least a gallon a day per person , better make that 2 gallons per person per day .
Try going without water for a day or two .
Just a few HOURS without water is much worse than a couple hours without power , its just that people rarely ever suffered that and just do n’t know it .
Water people , its free and only takes a bit of dedication to store large amounts of it in soda bottles or better containers , all over the house .
Water filters and water treatments pills , bleach and granulated chlorine , its all nice and dandy , but you ca n’t drink them , can you ?.
Get those , but get lots of water too .
Freeze dried , Mountain House brand , but also good old grocery stuff works as well .
Canned meats , fruits and vegetables .
Better if it requires no cooking .
Learn to read the nutritional facts in the container and packages .
Its not just about calories , you need a balanced diet as well .
Powdered milk , dried smashed potato flakes , rice , lentils , canned tuna or tuna pouches , tomato sauce , dried pasta , granulated chocolate , sugar , lots of salt ( preserving food ) , just to mentioned some .
Spend some time looking at what ’s available to you and check the expiration dates .
Sometimes you can easily go for months after the expiration date , specially when it comes to canned goods or some dehydrated ones , but it should n’t be hard at all to buy products that provide you a 6 to 12 month margin .
How much food ?
If you have the money get 6 months worth right away , you ’ll be eating it up anyway unless you know something I do n’t .
( and if you know how to live without eating , please do share :-)
) ( Antibiotics should be a priority here , when planning for worst case scenarios ) Batteries , LED flashlights , do n’t forget at least a cuple head lamps .
Try stnadarizing your batteries .
AA and AAAWhat this ?
Soap , toothpaste , toilet paper , bleach and the rest of the supplies needed on daily basis .
Just look at what you buy each month , and pretend tomorrow the supermarket near by wont be opening .
What would you do ?
Most likely the situation will be resolved in a few days , but what until then ?
What if it takes a couple weeks or a couple months ?
Information is priceless .
Just reading this blog will save you a great deal of money .
Learn as much as you can , participate in survival and preparedness forums , read as much as you can , and try learning from other ’s mistakes .
Specially when it comes to buying stuff , read lots of reviews before spending your hard earned money .
( except when it comes to handguns .
When it comes to handguns just buy any gun you want as long as its a Glock ... no , I ’m serious :- )
) This will apply to every single purchaser you make , you have to become a savvy shopper so as to save as much money as you can , and hopefully build up a nice cash stash and some gold as well .
Buying food and groceries as well as other supplies , you have to take advantage of every discount and sale you come across , you ’ll end up saving money by buying bulk , so its a double treat right there , you have months worth of supplies AND you save money .
When it comes to actual skills , there are at least two I ’d consider top priority .
1 ) Pistol self defense shooting2 )
First aid ( check for a red cross class near you by entering your zip code HERE After those , I ’d take a defensive driving class .
These are a bit harder to find but it sure is worth it since carjacking and such is something that can come in handy if crime gets 3rd worldly .
Pretty basic , but hopefully it will help some new guys and girls that are just getting started .

( CNN ) -- Former U.S. Attorney General John Ashcroft is not immune from being sued by a man who says he was illegally detained under Justice Department policies implemented after the September 11 terror attacks , a federal appeals court ruled Friday .
A spokesman for former Attorney General John Ashcroft says his team is reviewing the decision .
The man , a native - born U.S. citizen who was once a college football star , was held and interrogated by the FBI for 16 days in 2003 and his travel was limited for another year , court documents said .
A spokesman for Ashcroft , asked for his reaction , said , " We 're reviewing the decision and have no further comment . "
The court rejected Ashcroft 's argument that his involvement was as a prosecutor , which would give him full immunity from lawsuits , not as an investigator , which could leave him liable .
" We disagree , " the decision said .
" Many tools and tactics available to prosecutors can serve either an investigatory or advocacy - related function . "
Abdullah al - Kidd 's lawyers said Ashcroft developed a policy under which the FBI and Justice Department would use the federal material witness law as a pretext " to arrest and detain terrorism suspects about whom they did not have sufficient evidence to arrest on criminal charges but wished to hold preventively or to investigate further . "
His arrest warrant was based on an FBI affidavit that said he was needed to testify at the trial of a Saudi man who had been indicted on visa fraud .
Al - Kidd was never called as a witness in that case , in which the defendant was acquitted , court documents said .
Do n't Miss Read the opinion ( PDF )
The decision said that " al - Kidd 's arrest functioned as an investigatory arrest or national security - related pre-emptive detention , rather than as one to secure a witness 's testimony for trial . "
Al - Kidd , an African - American born in Wichita , Kansas , converted to Islam and changed his name from Lavini T. Kidd , according to court documents .
He was taken into custody at Dulles International Airport in northern Virginia as he prepared to depart to Saudi Arabia , where he planned to study Arabic and Islamic law , the documents said .
The FBI interrogated him , moving him from Virginia to Oklahoma and then Idaho , court documents said .
He was kept in chains while being held in high - security cells that were lit 24 hours a day , his lawyers said .
A judge ordered his release 16 days later , but he was required to surrender his passport and stay in Nevada for another 15 months .
During that time , he lost his job with a government contractor because he could not get a required security clearance .
The father of two also was divorced by his wife .
The FBI began watching al - Kidd months before detaining him , as part of their anti-terror investigation aimed at Muslim men , his lawyers said .
When agents learned of his plans to fly to Saudi Arabia , they obtained the " material witness " warrant based on their contention he would not return .
The agents failed to tell the magistrate who issued the warrant that al - Kidd was an American citizen with family in the United States , or that he had previously cooperated with the FBI , his lawyers said .
They also told the judge he had a one - way ticket , when he actually held a round - trip ticket , they said .

Rachel Maddow talks to Glenn Greenwald about Joe Lieberman 's threat to filibuster the health care bill if it contains a public option , Evan Bayh quickly following suit and the financial gain being made by both men and their spouses for doing so .
Maddow : Sen. Lieberman has made it very clear that he plans to oppose health reform that includes a public option .
He ’ll filibuster it in fact which would be historic .
What do you think is motivating him ?
Greenwald :
Well I think you have to look first of all at a Research 2000 Daily KOS poll that was taken last month that shows that a margin of 68 to 21 % of Connecticut voters , the people who he ’s essentially representing , favor a public option .
That ’s a 47 point margin which is almost impossible to find on almost any other issue .
So when you ask why he ’s doing this , it ’s clearly not because the people he ’s supposed to be representing favor it .
I think clearly what it ’s about is primarily that fact that the industry that he ’s serving by doing this — by preventing competition with the public option — is an industry from which he receives very substantial benefits .
He ’s drowning in campaign contributions from the insurance industry , the health care industry , the pharmaceutical industry — more than $ 2.5 million .
In early 2005 his wife was hired by a large P.R. firm , Hill & Knowlton , in the pharmaceutical division , which at the time was representing the health care giant Glaxo in major legislation before the Senate .
And several months later Joe Lieberman was on the floor of the Senate offering legislation that would directly steer huge amounts of incentives to that company in order to develop vaccines .
So I think what you ’re seeing here is the kind of legalized corruption , legalized bribery that runs the United States Senate ; only in this case it ’s particularly sleazy and transparent because Lieberman is ready to gut the major initiative of the Democratic Party .
Maddow :
In doing so , using a procedural tactic that he ’s in part made his name by opposing is the thing that ’s so dramatic .
Sen .
Lieberman of course — he made this big announcement yesterday — today Sen .
Evan Bayh of Indiana followed suit saying that he reserves the right now not only to filibuster the final vote , but even to filibuster earlier than that any debate on a bill that he ’s not happy with .
Sen .
Bayh — we had thought that other conservative Democrats might follow Lieberman ’s lead here , he sort of threw the door open and now presumably Bayh and maybe even others will follow .
Can you say anything about what may be motivating Bayh .
Greenwald : Well , let ’s look at Sen.
Bayh .
His wife sits on the Board of Directors of WellPoint , one of the largest health insurance companies in the nation .
They own by their own disclosures between $ 500,000 and a million dollars just of WellPoint stock alone .
And as I think you reported yesterday when Sen.
Lieberman threatened to filibuster to the public option as one would expect the value of the stock of the health care industries and the health care companies skyrocketed — which directly benefited , personally benefited the finances of the Bayh family .
Let me just quickly reference this column two weeks ago by Dan Carpenter , a columnist for the Indianapolis Sun , who knows Sen .
Bayh the best .
He talks about how his wife is benefiting directly from the very actions Sen .
Bayh is taking in the Senate to block health care reform — financially benefiting his family .
And he wrote “ after it became clear he was going to be a Senator , Susan Bayh started stacking up memberships on the board of health care corporations .
Susan Bayh got paid a little over $ 2 million for her service between 2006 and 2008 .
Her husband had a good 2008 also , collecting more than $ 500,000 in campaign donations from the health care industry .
And now these very same people who receive enormous amounts of benefits , in Lieberman ’s case from camp contributions and through his wife and also in Bayh ’s case are not ignoring their constituents and the interest of their country to serve the very industries that enrich them .
It ’s really clear corruption .
They went on to discuss the promises made by Joe Lieberman when he was allowed to keep his chairmanship and the way these corporate Democrats have been allowed to do anything they want while liberal Democrats have been threatened with loss of support unless they voted for the war supplemental bill .
It 's just pathetic that this type of reporting is the rarity instead of the norm on cable television .
If Lieberman and Bayh want to filibuster their own caucus in the Senate , I say break out the cots and the diapers .

“ LIKE elaborately plumed birds …we preen and strut and display our t-values . ”
That was Edward Leamer 's uncharitable description of his profession in 1983 .
Mr Leamer , an economist at the University of California in Los Angeles , was frustrated by empirical economists ' emphasis on measures of correlation over underlying questions of cause and effect , such as whether people who spend more years in school go on to earn more in later life .
Hardly anyone , he wrote gloomily , “ takes anyone else 's data analyses seriously ” .
To make his point , Mr Leamer showed how different ( but apparently reasonable ) choices about which variables to include in an analysis of the effect of capital punishment on murder rates could lead to the conclusion that the death penalty led to more murders , fewer murders , or had no effect at all .
In the years since , economists have focused much more explicitly on improving the analysis of cause and effect , giving rise to what Guido Imbens of Harvard University calls “ the causal literature ” .
The techniques at the heart of this literature — in particular , the use of so - called “ instrumental variables ” — have yielded insights into everything from the link between abortion and crime to the economic return from education .
But these methods are themselves now coming under attack .
Instrumental variables have become popular in part because they allow economists to deal with one of the main obstacles to the accurate estimation of causal effects — the impossibility of controlling for every last influence .
Mr Leamer 's work on capital punishment demonstrated that the choice of controls matters hugely .
Putting too many variables into a model ends up degrading the results .
Worst of all , some relevant variables may simply not be observable .
For example , the time someone stays in school is probably influenced by his innate scholastic ability , but this is very hard to measure .
Leaving such variables out can easily lead econometricians astray .
What is more , the direction of causation is not always clear .
Working out whether deploying more policemen reduces crime , for example , is confused by the fact that more policemen are allocated to areas with higher crime rates .
Instrumental variables are helpful in all these situations .
Often derived from a quirk in the environment or in public policy , they affect the outcome ( a person 's earnings , say , to return to the original example ) only through their influence on the input variable ( in this case , the number of years of schooling ) while at the same time being uncorrelated with what is left out ( scholastic ability ) .
The job of instrumental variables is to ensure that the omission of factors from an analysis — in this example , the impact of scholastic ability on the amount of schooling — does not end up producing inaccurate results .
In an influential early example of this sort of study , Joshua Angrist of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology ( MIT ) and Alan Krueger of Princeton University used America 's education laws to create an instrumental variable based on years of schooling .
These laws mean that children born earlier in the year are older when they start school than those born later in the year , which means they have received less schooling by the time they reach the legal leaving - age .
Since a child 's birth date is unrelated to intrinsic ability , it is a good instrument for teasing out schooling 's true effect on wages .
Over time , uses of such instrumental variables have become a standard part of economists ' set of tools .
Freakonomics , the 2005 bestseller by Steven Levitt and Stephen Dubner , provides a popular treatment of many of the techniques .
Mr Levitt 's analysis of crime during American election cycles , when police numbers rise for reasons unconnected to crime rates , is a celebrated example of an instrumental variable .
Two recent papers — one by James Heckman of Chicago University and Sergio Urzua of Northwestern University , and another by Angus Deaton of Princeton — are sharply critical of this approach .
The authors argue that the causal effects that instrumental strategies identify are uninteresting because such techniques often give answers to narrow questions .
The results from the quarter - of - birth study , for example , do not say much about the returns from education for college graduates , whose choices were unlikely to have been affected by when they were legally eligible to drop out of school .
According to Mr Deaton , using such instruments to estimate causal parameters is like choosing to let light “ fall where it may , and then proclaim[ing ] that whatever it illuminates is what we were looking for all along . ”
IV leagues
This is too harsh .
It is no doubt possible to use instrumental variables to estimate effects on uninteresting subgroups of the population .
But the quarter - of - birth study , for example , shone light on something that was both interesting and significant .
The instrumental variable in this instance allows a clear , credible estimate of the return from extra schooling for those most inclined to drop out from school early .
These are precisely the people whom a policy that sought to prolong the amount of education would target .
Proponents of instrumental variables also argue that accurate answers to narrower questions are more useful than unreliable answers to wider questions .
A more legitimate fear is that important questions for which no good instrumental variables can be found are getting short shrift because of economists ' obsession with solving statistical problems .
Mr Deaton says that instrumental variables encourage economists to avoid “ thinking about how and why things work ” .
Striking a balance between accuracy of result and importance of issue is tricky .
If economists end up going too far in emphasising accuracy , they may succeed in taking “ the con out of econometrics ” , as Mr Leamer urged them to — only to leave more pressing questions on the shelf .

Ten Main Points :
The execution of America ’s post -Korean wars in the Third World is all about the differential value of life put on those colored “ Others , ” in other words , race / ethnicity matters .
This can be seen in the language / framing of official discourse , in the language of soldiers , and in outcomes exposing the differential value of life practiced by Americans such as in compensation for wrongful death ;
America ’s war in Afghanistan has been anything but a “ precision ” war executed with new , high - tech weapons .
The fault lies less in the weapons themselves and more in how they have been used by American military personnel carrying out the policies of the Bush and Obama administrations .
The metric of civilians killed to occupation soldiers killed , measures the relative lethality of the American - led Afghan war .
I demonstrated that Taliban suicide - bombers are more precise than U.S. high - tech aerial bombs ;
The costs of this war for Afghanistan and the Afghan people are enormous and multi-dimensional ;
The “ new ” war approach by General McChrystal which has substituted rising deaths of ( mostly lower class rural ) American soldiers for lesser Afghan civilian deaths ( in order to maintain a NATO effort ) confirms what I have long been arguing : U./S aerial strikes were a chosen way of minimizing U.S casualties at the expense of Afghan civilian deaths and injured ;
Obama , the quintessential Mr. Image , has significantly escalated the U.S-led war in Afghanistan and Pakistan , whereas the older NATO allies are increasingly reluctant to continue what augers to be a war without end .
They are intelligently avoiding the sunk cost fallacy whereas Obama is embracing it .
On the other hand , the U.S. cannot pursue this war on its own ( along with some token , ill - trained Estonians , Mongolians , Colombians , or Macedonians ) ;
The U.S mainstream media , especially television ( e.g. , CBS ’s favorite foreign correspondent Lara Logan , long - tim civilian fan of the U.S. military in Afghanistan , is now a shameless pro-war advocate ( 3 ) ) and talk radio but also the Associated Press wire service , has played a major role in confusing the American general public about the reasons for and the execution of America ’s Afghan war .
Where are all the photos of those obliterated and / or maimed by U.S troops ? ( 4 )
Other American commentators - the humanitarian interventionists on Afghanistan - including Human Rights Watch , Sarah Chayes , Harvard ’s Carr Center , etc. - present a completely idyllic end - game where jolly Afghan farmers labor in cooperatives producing pomegranates or saffron for export and Afghan girls ’ schools dot the countryside .
This has nothing to do with reality and all with marketing / selling the war to the American general public ;
America ’s Afghan war is unwinnable militarily as well as in a hearts - and - minds counter - insurgency terms .
Moreover , the American bombing and subsequent occupation of Afghanistan has strengthened , not weakened , Al Qaeda by romoting its decentralization across at least two continents ( Asia and Africa ) .
Thanks to America , Al Qaeda is now a global organization ;
The only solution is for the U.S to withdraw as expeditiously as possible just as the Soviets did in 1989 , letting Afghans work out a livable arrangement as the Vietnamese did in 1975 .
The Obama / McChrystal approach promises war without end and the Biden approach is an invitation for a second 9/11 ;
History tells us very clearly that the single most important factor which motivates a U.S withdrawal from a conflict soon is escalating U.S. military casualties .
The lessons from Indochina ( 1965 - 75 ) , the Lebanon bomb attack which killed 241 US troops ( 1983 ) , Somalia ’s Blackhawks down ( 1993 ) are clear for all to see .
Exactly eight years ago today , U.S. “ precision ” air strikes on October 15 , 2001 , killed 16 - 21 Afghan civilians ( details in Appendix A ) .
I wish to focus in my talk upon the execution of ( not the rationales for ) war and on the effects of this U.S-led war upon Afghanistan and its people .
A fully referenced version of my talk is coming up on RAWA ’s web site as I speak .
Let me begin with a brief comment .
As all marketing accepts , words matter and we thus need to struggle which meaning dominates .
Let me give you two examples : the U.S/ NATO presence in Afghanistan is not about peace - keeping but rather about a foreign occupation ; and those fighting such occupation are neither terrorists nor insurgents but rather the resistance ( though maybe not our preferred type of resistance ) .
Not Obama ’s fluffy rhetoric about “ war of necessity ” , but rather a war of choice .
( 5 ) A strange thing happened during the last twenty years : any force opposing U.S. geo-political designs around the world is now labeled terrorist .
As Mike Davis so tellingly pointed out , the car bomb or suicide - bomber is the air force of the poor .
( 6 ) The Axis armies of mid-twentieth century were never labeled terrorist .
You see this war is as much about words , meanings , images and information as it is about IED ’s and GPS - guided bombs .
I begin with an uncomfortable fact : race / ethnicity matters in the execution of America ’s post - Korean wars in the Third World ( whether in Indochina , El Salvador , Iraq , Somalia , or Afghanistan ) .
We see this in the differential value put on the lives of those “ Others ” , as well as in the language / framing of official discourse and in the language of common U.S. soldiers ( graffiti , inscriptions on bombs and missiles destined to rain down upon Afghanistan or Iraq like “ Here ’s a Ramadan present from Chad Rickenberg ” written on a 2,000 - lb laser - guided bomb on the USS Enterprise in 1998 , ( 7 ) in e-mails and on blogs [ mentioning “ Afghan ragheads ” ] , at Abu Ghraib , use of the term ‘ Islamo - fascists ’ , etc. ) .
( 8 ) U.S. official and media demonization of “ the enemy ” - a long U.S. tradition ( 9 ) - gets translated into such inscriptions on bombs and the like .
In 1989 , Christopher Hitchens published excerpts from a songbook produced and distributed by the US Air Force ’s 77th Tactical Fighter Squadron ( based in South Carolina ) : “ Phantom flyers in the sky , Persian - pukes prepare to die , Rolling in with snake and nape ( 10 ) , Allah creates but we cremate . ” ( 11 )

The Afghan academic Mir Hekmatullah Sadat wrote ,
Let 's face it : Osama Bin Laden , Al - Qaeda , and their supporters do not represent the 20 million people of Afghanistan .
Misrepresentation of facts to the masses , naive assessments , and faulty research by the media and scholars have incited the world against Afghans by dehumanizing them .
This is what Edward Said calls " Orientalism . "
Demonizing Afghan culture by giving the impression that Afghans are savages while Americans are this " bourgeois " or civilized culture is immoral .
This type of splitting up the world between civilized and un-civilized will not end the terrorism directed at Americans and Afghans .
This rhetoric is based on race models rooted in Euro- centric ideologies of the 19th century .
It is a slap in the face of those working for peace and unity in Afghanistan and America .
Furthermore , it casts doubt onto the academic scholars who publish such travesties . ( 12 )
Slide # 2 . Insert cover page of Frontline ( October 24 , 2008 )
Let ’s take the matter of the anti-septic , Nintendo - like U.S. drone strikes so cherished by President Obama and Vice - President Biden .
As the independent Representative Ron Paul noted ,
What if tomorrow morning you woke up to headlines that yet another Chinese drone bombing on U.S. soil killed several dozen ranchers in a rural community while they were sleeping ?
That a drone aircraft had come across the Canadian border in the middle of the night and carried out the latest of many attacks ?
What if it was claimed that many of the victims harbored anti-Chinese sentiments , but most of the dead were innocent women and children ?
And what if the Chinese administration , in an effort to improve its public image in the U.S. , had approved an aid package to send funds to help with American roads and schools and promote Chinese values here ?
Most Americans would not stand for it .
Yet the above hypothetical events are similar to what our government is doing in Pakistan .
Last week , Congress did approve an aid package for Pakistan for the stated purposes of improving our image and promoting democracy .
.. What if this happened on U.S. soil ?
What if innocent Americans were being killed in repeated drone attacks carried out by some foreign force who was trying to fix our problems for us ?
Would sending money help their image ? ( 13 )
Forty - five years ago , Norman Mailer wrote similarly about Lyndon Johnson ’s war escalation in Vietnam . ( 14 )
For those more inclined to numerical evidence , I have been documenting now for six years how the differential value put upon life ( and death ) is revealed in the compensation paid for wrongful deaths by the U.S. military .
When we make the comparisons in purchasing power parity terms , we find the following very clear gradient in the valuation of life possessing a strong color gradient :

Recent estimates used by the Environmental Protection Agency have been $ 6.1 million [ see the excellent paper by Frank Ackerman and Lisa Heinzerling , " The $ 6.1 Million Question " [ Medford , MA. : Global Development and Environment Institute Working Paper No. 01-06 , Tufts University , April 2002 ] , available at : http://ase.tufts.edu/gdae).

** the Afghan ratio of 4 is estimated on basis of GDP data and it is close to that for Pakistan where prices are similar , a ratio of 4.25 in Pakistan .
The Afghan and Pakistani economies have been very tightly linked monetarily .

Were an Afghan compensated for according to the traditional Afghan practice of the Diyat , the amount would approach that paid out ( in PPP $ ’s ) by the United States to the family of a victim of the Iranian Airbus shooting - down in 1998 .
Instead , the U.S , military distributes a condolence payment one - fifteenth the amount offered to the family of an Iranian victim .
Lew Rockwell noted that Americans believe they are the chosen people ( expressed in more academic terms as an alleged “ American exceptionalism ” meaning a belief that the U.S. has a special world historical role to play ( 15 ) ) .
Others have argued that the USA suffers from a pathological narcissistic personality disorder .
( 16 ) Hence , an American life is higher on the scale of human civilization than say that of an Afghan , Indian or Iraqi .
In order to preserve lives of American soldiers a trade - off is implemented : the U.S , military simply relies upon air strikes instead of ground forces as the former entails essentially no risk whereas ground combat in difficult , foreign terrain like Afghanistan is treacherous .
In other words , certain Afghan civilian casualties are traded - off for sparing the lives of U.S. ground soldiers .
America ’s Afghan war has been particularly deadly for innocent civilians .
In the United States , three levels which interact are at play to put a low value on Afghan lives :
Slide # 4
Whereas bombs and missiles are now more precisely targeted using laser or GPS guidance systems , the very high explosive power of the bombs guarantees that civilians in the general area of the impact bomb will be killed .
When U.S. military personnel drop such bombs in civilian - rich areas , innocents die .
The numbers of civilians killed per 10,000 tons bombs delivered was : 4,744 in the Allied bombing campaign of Germany during World War II ; 870 in the U.S. bombing of North Vietnam during Rolling Thunder ; 1,840 during the intense U.S. bombing of Cambodia ; and over 2,000 during the three months ’
U.S. bombing of Afghanistan in 2001 . ( 17 )

The relative lethality of the U.S-led war in Afghanistan is captured by the ratio of civilians killed to U.S/ NATO occupation soldiers killed .
The following Table 3 summarizes such data .
Over three Afghan civilians died for every occupation soldier killed during 2005 - middle of 2009 ; in other words , the execution of the U.S - led war was more than three times more deadly for innocent Afghans than it was for the aggressor forces .
Naturally , the costs of the American - led war far exceed that of civilians killed by US / NATO forces , but time does not allow exploring such here . ( 18 )

The Table 3 above documents my fourth point : the reduction of U.S aerial strikes ordered by General McChrystal has led to a precipitous drop in the ratio of civilians killed per occupation soldier – from 3.7 for the first half of 2009 to about 0.8 during July - August 2009 .
In effect , in order to maintain a fracturing NATO coalition in Afghanistan , McChrystal was forced to field more U.S ground forces and absorb far higher levels of occupation soldier casualties .
This point is enormously important as it confirms what I have long been arguing : U.S aerial strikes were a chosen way of minimizing U.S casualties at the expense of Afghan civilian deaths and injured .
In other words , a conscious self - serving U.S decision was made to impose undue harm upon Afghan civilians .
That is a war crime .
Moreover , as I have long argued and documented , some 60 - 70 percent of Afghan civilians killed by U.S and NATO forces have been women and children ( 19 ) .
That is another war crime !
My fifth point deserves little elaboration .
Obama has ratcheted up the American - led war upon Afghanistan , proclaiming it to be a “ war of necessity . ”
Evidence for escalation includes a major surge in U.S occupation forces and extending the war into the Pakistan border regions with U.S drone strikes .
U.S occupation forces numbered 52,000 uniformed personnel and 68,000 contractors in Afghanistan in March 2009 according to the Congressional Budget Office , to which now needs be added Obama ’s extra 14,000 sent - over in mid-2009 and McChrystal ’s additional request of 40 - 60,000 , making 174- 194,000 ( far exceeding the Soviet ’s ’ 115,000 peak ) .
The drone strikes are contributing to the further destabilization of Pakistan and the rapid growth of the forces of radical Islam .
The equation is simple : drone strikes which kill recruit future suicide bombers , merely serving to promote a future of war without end .
The weak link in Obama ’s escalation is Old Europe and Canada .
These governments are increasingly wary of such war without end , all the more so as the aim of this war remains ill - defined .
These countries ’ leaders unlike Obama are no embracing the sunk - cost fallacy ( escalating in “ order to get the job done ” ) .
The Al Qaeda attacks in London , Madrid , etc. need not be planned in the Afghan - Pakistan area , but can be concocted in Florida , Hamburg , Yemen , etc .
If Old Europe withdraws its occupation forces , the U.S. will not be able to continue its large - scale ground war – token numbers of ill - trained Estonians , Mongolians and Macedonians will not do .
Most of the above remains insufficiently mediagenic to be reported in the United States .
In 2008 , John Pilger of Britain wrote about Obama is the prince of bait - and - switch ,
Those who write of Obama that " when it comes to international affairs , he will be a huge improvement on Bush " demonstrate the same willful naivety that backed the bait - and - switch of Bill Clinton - and Tony Blair … Eleven years and five wars later , at least a million people lie dead .
Barack Obama is the American Blair .
That he is a smooth operator and a black man is irrelevant .
He is of an enduring , rampant system whose drum majors and cheer squads never see , or want to see , the consequences of 500 lb bombs dropped unerringly on mud , stone and straw houses … ( Bush press spokesman ) Scott McClellan has called " complicit enablers " - journalists who serve as little more than official amplifiers .
Having declared Afghanistan a " good war " , the complicit enablers are now anointing Barack Obama as he tours the bloodfests in Afghanistan and Iraq .
What they never say is that Obama is a bomber . ( 20 )
The U.S corporate media has spent eight long years serving as the Pentagon ’s mouthpiece – naturally some news reporters buck the trend maintaining independence , e.g. , Carlotta Gall ( New York Times ) and Kathy Gannon come to mind .
I have documented this in numerous publications .
( 21 ) During 2001 - 5 , this media was enthralled with the notion of “ precision weaponry , ” assuring the U.S public that the U.S was waging a clean , antiseptic war .
A core requirement of the post - Vietnam Pentagon ’s public - relations - ized warfare model has been the need to keep media corralled in order to black out news of “ blood ” ( especially dead civilians ) .
( 22 ) Once the Taliban & Co. resistance began going on the offensive and war - related deaths soared , the media simply chose to omit reporting upon Afghan civilian casualties ; the only exception being cases where the death toll was huge and simply could not be hidden , e.g. , a fine example of that was the recent slaughter of close to 100 Afghan civilians executed by two USAF F - 15E Strike Eagles .
( 23 ) Special effort was devoted to not printing any photos of innocent Afghans killed or wounded by U.S bombs or ground forces .
( 24 ) Photos like the following never appear in the U.S corporate media or in Human Rights Watch ( and publications of the other humanitarian interventionists ) :
Slides #’s 7 , 8 , 9 , 10 and 11
The truth is that Afghanistan is largely irrelevant to U.S designs .
For U.S. officialdom ,
Afghanistan is seen as an “ empty space ” as I have argued many times , most recently in my book .
( 25 ) The U.S. seeks to re-establish Afghanistan as an empty buffer state at minimum cost ( by which I mean few soldiers ’ bodies and a few dollars ) .
Interestingly , a central component of Al Qaeda ’s strategy is to bleed America to bankruptcy and to spread out U.S. forces to the greatest degree possible ( 26 ) ( both captured in the phrase “ imperial overstretch ” ) .
All the talk about democracy and girls ’ schools is for public consumption in Euro - America .
Indeed , the new so - called humanitarian interventions are merely a smokescreen to hide and sell larger geopolitical agendas . ( 27 )
Al Qaeda is eminently succeeding in piggy - backing upon the Taliban nationalist resistance and turning the U.S-led war in Afghanistan into a major financial burden at the time when the Obama administration faces unprecedented deficits .
The U.S war in Afghanistan is currently costing $ 5 billion a month , or $ 115 , 740 a minute !
( 28 ) U.S war spending on Afghanistan promises to be a replay of Lyndon Johnson ’s escalation which served to scuttle his Great Society Plans and ultimately his presidency .
A steady chorus has been maintained by the humanitarian imperialists – enamored with nation - building – who use human rights to sell war .
( 29 ) Charter members of this group include Human Rights Watch , Sarah Chayes , the Carr Center at Harvard , Samantha Powers , Code Pink , and many of the guests on National Public Radio .
They dream of an idyllic end - game where jolly Afghan farmers labor in cooperatives producing the likes of pomegranates or saffron for export in an Afghan countryside dotted with girls ’ schools .
For such a vision to be established would require the occupation of the countryside .
That would involve half a million reliable ( presumably NATO ) troops – the Vietnamese were far better - trained and much more numerous in 1974 - 75 and could not prevail .
( 30 ) In the interim , the Taliban & Co. sow sufficient violence in order to keep large areas of rural Afghanistan - estimated now at around 80 % of the countryside - off - limits to reconstruction .
Even U.S. officialdom is now forced to concede that Afghan civil society is in shambles ,
Afghanistan is now so dangerous , administration officials said , that many aid workers cannot travel outside the capital , Kabul , to advise farmers on crops , a key part of Mr. Obama ’s announcement in March that he was deploying hundreds of additional civilians to work in the country .
The judiciary is so weak that Afghans increasingly turn to a shadow Taliban court system because , a senior military official said , “ a lot of the rural people see the Taliban justice as at least something . ” ( 31 )
The U.S. policy of setting up Provincial Reconstruction Teams which blend military and civic activities has served to make all reconstruction appear part of counter - insurgency .
Such reconstruction efforts thus became targets .
You will recall that Medecins Sans Frontieres left Afghanistan in 2004 for that reason despite having been present during the 1990 ’s and the Taliban years .
We can thank America for having blurred the boundary between military operations and pure humanitarian efforts to aid the long - suffering Afghan people .
I close with three interrelated points : the American - led war has failed ; the only option is to exit as soon as possible ; but , sadly , if history provides a lesson such a U.S. exit will not take place until the level of U.S casualties reaches a magnitude which spurs a level of popular opposition to the war that the Obama administration will be forced to act .
Maybe the simplest way to document the utter failure of the American - led war is simply to look at the map of Afghanistan released September 10 , 2009 by the British - based International Council on Security and Development ( ICOS ) : Substantial Taliban activity exists in 97 percent of Afghanistan .
Areas with heavy Taliban presence rose from 54 % in 2007 to 72 % in 2008 and to 80 % in 2009 :
Slide # 12 : Taliban Presence Map : January - September 2009
The U.S military policies of bombing Afghanistan and Pakistan have strengthened not weakened the Taliban and Al Qaeda .
As the foreign occupation has worn on , simple Afghan nationalism has soared which , combined with Afghans ’ practice of revenging a family or friend ’s death , has fuelled the Afghan resistance .
William Polk , a participant in U.S. foreign relations since the Kennedy Administration , put it spot -on ,
US military intervention in Afghanistan has not only solidified the Taliban as an organization but has also created increasing public support for it .
There is much evidence in Afghanistan , as there has been in every insurgency I have studied , that foreign soldiers increase rather than calm hostility .
The British found that to be true even in the American Revolution ( where the two sides were " cousins , " shared the same religion and spoke the same language ) . ( 32 )
The very presence now of foreign occupation troops in Afghanistan fuels the resistance .
Many Afghans see us as they regarded the Russians , as foreign , anti-Muslim invaders .
Again , Polk argues
Even in the tactical short run , I believe , trying to defeat the Taliban is not in America 's interest .
The harder we try , the more likely terrorism will be to increase and spread .
As the history of every insurgency demonstrates , the more foreign boots there are on the ground and the harder the foreigners fight , the more hatred they engender .
Substituting drone attacks for ground combat is no solution .
Having been bombed from the air , I can attest that it is more infuriating than a ground attack . ( 33 )
The obliteration of Al Qaeda camps has merely served to decentralize that organization across two large continents – Asia and Africa .
Thanks to America , Al Qaeda is now a global organization , serving as a force multiplier to local radical Islamic groups . ( 34 )
The only solution is for the U.S. to withdraw as soon as possible just as the Soviets did in early 1989 .
Even conservative columnist George Will agrees .
( 35 ) Certain myths have been cultivated to counter calls for immediate withdrawal .
The first myth asserts that a Taliban presence would lead to a renewed sanctuary for Al Qaeda and again the United States would be vulnerable to a 9/11 - style attack .
Melvin Goodman at Johns Hopkins has refuted such nonsense ,
There are very few al - Qaeda forces in Afghanistan , and both the Bush and Obama administrations have been successful in using Predator strikes against the al - Qaeda leadership in Pakistan , Somalia and Yemen .
In the past year , US and Pakistani intelligence have enabled the Predator and other means to eliminate a significant number of al - Qaeda leaders , restrict al - Qaeda 's ability to operate and to eliminate some of its financial support .
More importantly , al - Qaeda 's leadership does not need a sanctuary or safe haven in Afghanistan to plan its operations .
The training and preparations for the 9/11 attacks in Washington , DC , and New York City , after all , took place in US flight schools as well as in several apartments in German cities .
Paul Pillar , the former deputy chief of the CIA 's counterterrorist center has argued that al - Qaeda 's terrorist threat is " less one of commander than of ideological lodestar , and for that role a haven is almost meaningless . " ( 36 )
A second myth involves the much - ballyhooed fantasy that with judicious carrots - and - sticks the Taliban can be split and weakened .
Again , Goodman provides a cogent refutation ,
Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , who commands more than 100,000 US and international forces , has endorsed a counterinsurgency strategy that views the Taliban as a collection of armed groups with different political and economic objectives .
McChrystal believes that an additional 40,000 US troops would make it easier to divide the Taliban and wean a significant number of Taliban fighters away from the insurgency .
In fact , it is the international coalition that lacks clear direction , and it is Taliban forces that currently have the strategic initiative .
The Taliban have demonstrated an increasingly coordinated and centralized approach in their tactics and operations over the past several years , and there is ample evidence that the Afghan population recognizes this fact and has provided greater support to the insurgency .
Conversely , the US offensive in Helmand this summer , which involved nearly 20,000 troops , failed to weaken the Taliban on the southern front ; the British offensive there three years ago also failed .
Secretary of Defense Robert Gates ' belief that a significant number of Taliban forces can be brought to our side is dead wrong , and this is the kind of wishful thinking that appears to be central to McChrystal 's counterinsurgency strategy .
The Taliban may not be monolithic , but they have political control of their forces .
Increasing US forces will likely strengthen the Taliban and enhance Taliban recruitment efforts .
Recently , McChrystal proposed outright paying Taliban fighters to defect , a proposal which drew a sharp rebuke from Gilles Dorronsoro of the Carnegie Institute ,
You cannot break an insurgency that strong with money .
It ’s not a mercenary force – it ’s a very powerful movement . ( 37 )
A third myth is to present the Taliban and Al Qaeda as one - and - the - same .
This is false as the Taliban have a domestic agenda with no international aspirations whereas Al Qaeda and similar groups are engaged in a global jihad .
Moreover , the Taliban learned in late 2001 what the wrath of the United States can accomplish and would not host Al Qaeda again , a point admitted by the few more thoughtful western commentators . ( 38 )
A fourth myth is that the U.S. should stay - the - course and redouble efforts to train Afghan army and police units , akin to the Vietnamization the U.S Indochinese war .
( 39 ) Vietnam had a much more developed institutional capacity and a far better motivated army , but in the end little mattered .
The Afghan army and police are notoriously unreliable and ineffective as recently argued by Ann Jones . ( 40 )
The Biden approach of relying mostly upon drone strikes targeting alleged Al Qaeda targets in the border areas would further inflame the Pashtuns living in these areas .
The Pashtuns and radical Islamists are helpless against the drones and hence revenge would have to be taken out elsewhere , such as in India ( Mumbai ) , Europe ( Madrid , London ) or the United States .
The asymmetric drone warfare would elicit a repeat of 9/11 .
Conclusion :
But , in my view , none of the reasoning above will encourage the Obama - led occupation of and war in Afghanistan to end .
The only thing which will , history has clearly shown us , is when the number of U.S casualties ( dead and injured ) reaches very high levels as occurred in Indochina after the Tet offensive of 1968 , in Beirut in 1983 , and in Somalia in 1993 .
This brings me right back to my beginning point : some bodies matter much more than others in the United States .
Regardless of their bodies , when the numbers of ours mount , a U.S war ends .
APPENDIX A . U.S. attacks upon Afghanistan on October 15 , 2001
October 15th : the official story
Attacks carried out by : 6 - 8 bombers , 92 - 94
Navy strike aircraft ; 5 cruise missiles
Planned targets for the day : 12 targets - a training camp south of Jalalabad , the airports of Kabul and Mazar , and garrisons in Kandahar [ @7 ] and Kabul [ @2 ] - per map at Global Security at http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/ops/images/011016-D-6570C-002.jpg
The day was discussed [ so - to - speak ] at the October 16th Pentagon press briefing held by ' fightin ' Victoria Clarke and General Newbold .
Newbold reported ,
" We did continue our operations against al Qaeda and the terrorists yesterday .
We struck 12 target areas that included a terrorist camp and a training area .
We struck , and continue to strike , airfields , aircraft , AAA and SAM sites .
We struck the Taliban forces in a robust way that included troop and vehicle staging areas , some storage and maintenance sheds .
And we hit some troop equipment storage buildings .
We used over 100 strike aircraft .
Most of them came off the carriers .
We used six to eight long - range bombers in the mission ......
As most of you know , we also introduced the AC - 130 Spectre gunship yesterday .
As you all also know , we wo n't discuss the specific targets it was used against or the bases it came from . "
Newbold also mentioned that strikes on October 15th took place around Mazar , on SAM sites in Kandahar , and the use of two deadly AC - 130 gunships in Kandahar . ( 41 )
Lt. Gen . Newbold sang the craft 's praises Tuesday :
" The AC - 130 gunship is an excellent platform to use in this environment , " he said .
" It has precision weapons platforms which allow us to reduce collateral damage at the impact point .
It has the ability to station itself over a target area for a long period of time .
It also has a large crew of specialists able to acquire targets to a degree that a fighter aircraft cannot . "
A retired Air Force colonel put it ,
“ The A ( for Attack ) C - 130 gunship is low , slow , and ever so deadly .
You use them when you own the sky .
They carry a 25 - mm Gatling Gun capable of firing 1,800 rounds per minute , as well as 40 - mm and 105 - mm cannons — all side - firing .
Out of a crew of 13 , there are five gunners on board . " ( 42 )
The Real Story in Alternative reporting :
The Center for Defense Intelligence reported that " following weekend raids in which cruise missiles and warplanes struck two dozen targets , bombs were dropped on Kabul , Kandahar , and Jalalabad in some of the heaviest daytime raids to date .
They were accompanied in some areas by leaflets and humanitarian rations .
AC - 130 gunships were used to attack Taliban strongholds and troop concentrations on the ground .
A dwindling number of strategic fixed targets has necessitated a reorientation toward mobile ground forces and other targets of opportunity . "
Jane 's Defense Weekly citing Northern Alliance sources reported that 5'000 - 6'000 Taliban Pakistani and Arab troops were ranged across a fontline that stretched across the Shomali plain some 40 kms .
north of Kabul , from Sinjendera in the west to the Koh - i - Safi mountains in the east .
( 43 ) North of Kabul , Arab and Pakistani units occupied several key positions including the Tutakhan ridge / village [ a key Arab command center ] , Gozar and the Old Road .
The U.S. missile and bombing attacks on October 15th hit empty training camps , killed goats in Pakistan , struck a World Food Program warehouse in northern Kabul , killed Haziza 's mother and father in Kabul , hit a hospital in Kandahar , missed a camp near Agam but set two small mountain villages ablaze , and impaired the Naghlu hydro power station which supplies Kabul .
On this Monday , U.S. planes launched their heaviest daytime strikes on Kabul since the raids began eight days ago .
( 44 ) Explosions rocked the city at 6:30 AM , again at 9:20 AM , two more times at 10:00 AM and 11:30 AM , and another two bombs hit the already battered airport at 12:30 .
A large cloud of dust was seen north of the city , indicating some mud - brick houses had been struck .
The Taliban 's 16th Army Division garrison located in Khair Khana , a northern outskirt of Kabul , on the road to Bagram was bombed , killing 3 Taliban militiamen .
A stray U.S. bomb hit 12 - year old Haziza 's house in a poor neighborhood near the Kabul airport .
It killed her mother and 13 year - old brother .
After burying his family members , her father decided to leave Kabul for Peshawar to save his remaining children . ( 45 )
The Naghlu power station was hit late Monday , disabling power supply to Kabul for 48 hours .
( 46 ) Abdul Himat of the Taliban Bakhtar news agency put it well ,
" Targeting electricity supply and international telephone lines is against international law .
This can only hurt ordinary people - it is really contemptible . "
At least three powerful explosions rocked the eastern edge of Jalalabad .
Two bombs were dropped on the empty Taliban military of 1st Army Corps east of the city which had been vacated .
Table .
Summary of the Day's U.S. Bombing Attacks
Kabul city Airport area and adjacent military base Attacks started at ~ 6:30 AM and lasted all day .
Killed two members of Haziza 's family Jalalabad Army No. 1 Corps base near the city 's airport ~9 AM attack involved 10 explosions east of city .
Army No. 1 Corps base had been vacated near Parachinar in Pakistan in the Spin Ghar mountains A stray cruise missile landed at night
Hit tiny shepherd village , killing goats and sheep northern area of Kabul bombing Strikes close to UN 's World Food Program warehouse on Afsotar , injuring one worker with shrapnel Nangarhar province , area 35 kms .
south of Jalalabad Intense bombing and missile attacks 11 AM attack , missed Tora Bora camp and hit two small villages - Gerekhil and Morgai - setting them ablaze .
Injures 6 and 1 dies on way to hospital Kandahar city Heavy strafing by AC - 130s and bombing Intense evening strafing , kills 5 in a hospital and 3 in a village near army barracks in eastern district .
Himat says 13 killed on Monday night Mazar - i- Sharif Airport area bombed four times Killed five Area east of Kabul Hit the Naghlu hydroelectric facility on the Kabul River Disrupted power supply to Kabul for two days .
Naghlu is Afghanistan 's largest power station , a 100 MW unit built in 1967 by the Soviets
Al - Jazeera 's reporter in Kandahar said that an AC - 130 had hit a hospital in the area of the huge Qishla Jadeeed military base in northern Kandahar , killing five people who were seeking treatment .
Later , Mr. Himat said the Monday night attacks had killed 13 civilians .
( 47 ) Afghans were fleeing Kandahar to neighboring Pakistan .
Abdul Wail , a shopkeeper from Kandahar told the Reuters news agency in Quetta ,
" I 've seen the bodies of women and children pulled out of the rubble of their homes . " ( 48 )
The Afghan Islamic Press reported that U.S. jets bombed two villages in the Agam area near Tora Bora - Gerekhil and Morgai - injuring six people of whom one died on his way to a hospital .
( 49 ) Four intense attacks hit the Mazar area before 5 AM .
A bomb fell on houses in northern part of the city leaving one woman and four men dead . ( 50 )
A $ 1 million Tomahawk cruise missile aimed at the Tora Bora camp strayed , landing on the Pakistani side of the Spin Ghar [ White Mountains ] hills near the border town of Parachinar .
It hit shepherd 's hamlets in Spin Ghar , killing sheep and goats . ( 51 )
Many months later , a reporter described what he saw at the Taliban Army 's No. 1 Corps military base outside Jalalabad :
" Outside the eastern city of Jalalabad , there is an army base , heavily bombed by the Americans .
Craters 40 feet deep mark the spot where buildings once stood .
Nearby , tanks are blown to pieces , or lie upside down as if some oversize child had cast them about .
Strewn about the area are unexploded cluster bombs , each capable of destroying a large truck -- hazards that will linger long after the American campaign ends .
Those bombs are on top of the estimated 10 million landmines left over from the civil war , which kill or wound an average of at least three people each day . " ( 52 )
On October 14/15 , 2001 , U.S. psyop planes dropped leaflets on Paktia and Samangan provinces . ( 53 ) The leaflet [ see below ] announced , " The partnership of nations is here to help . "
( 54 ) Other U.S. planes - warplanes - dropped bombs upon Kabul city , Jalalabad , the villages of Gerekhil and Morgai , Kandahar city , Mazar - i- Sharif , and the Naghlu hydroelectric power station , killing 16 - 21 innocent Afghan civilians on October 15th .
Another such leaflet with the same text showed a U.S. soldier shaking hands with an Afghan civilian .
By mid-October , U.S. Navy and Air Force pilots had run out of pre-authorized targets and were allowed to fire at will after receiving the go - ahead from forward air - controllers .
( 55 ) Some regions of Afghanistan were henceforth designated as ' kill boxes ' , or ' engagement zones ' , patrolled day - and - night by low - flying aircraft with the charge to shoot at anything moving - memories of Vietnam 's free - fire zones ..

( Miami , FL , September 29 , 2009 ) —
The United States District Court for the Southern District of Florida today rejected Lambda Legal 's lawsuit filed against Jackson Memorial Hospital on behalf of Janice Langbehn , the Estate of Lisa Pond and their three adopted children who were kept apart by hospital staff for eight hours as Lisa slipped into a coma and died .
" The court 's decision paints a tragically stark picture of how vulnerable same - sex couples and their families really are during times of crisis , " said Beth Littrell , Staff Attorney in Lambda Legal 's Southern Regional Office based in Atlanta .
" We hope that because of Janice 's courage to seek justice for her family in this case that more people better understand the costs of antigay discrimination .
This should never happen to anyone . "
While on a family cruise leaving from Miami , Lisa Pond , a healthy 39 year - old , suddenly collapsed .
She was rushed to Miami's Jackson Memorial Hospital with her partner Janice and three children following close behind .
There , the hospital refused to accept information from Janice about her partner 's medical history .
Janice was informed that she was in an antigay city and state , and she could expect to receive no information or acknowledgment as Lisa 's partner or family .
A doctor finally spoke with Janice telling her that there was no chance of recovery .
Other than one five minute visit that was arranged by a Catholic priest at Janice 's request to perform last rites , and despite the doctor 's acknowledgement that no medical reason existed to prevent visitation , neither Janice — who provided the hospital with a medical Power of Attorney document — nor their children were allowed to see Lisa until nearly eight hours after their arrival .
Soon after Lisa 's death , Janice tried to get her death certificate in order to get life insurance and Social Security benefits for their children .
She was denied both by the State of Florida and the Dade County Medical Examiner .
Today 's ruling comes after the Public Health Trust of the Miami Dade County , the governing body of Jackson Memorial Hospital , filed a motion to dismiss the case .
The court ruled that the hospital has neither an obligation to allow their patients ' visitors nor any obligation whatsoever to provide their patients ' families , healthcare surrogates , or visitors with access to patients in their trauma unit .
The court has given the Langbehn - Pond family until October 16 to review the ruling and consider all legal options .
Beth Littrell , Staff Attorney in Lambda Legal 's Southern Regional Office in Atlanta is lead counsel on the case for Lambda Legal .
She is joined by co-counsel Donald J. Hayden of Baker & McKenzie , LLP .
The case is Langbehn v. Jackson Memorial Hospital .

WASHINGTON  President Obama mounted a frontal assault on the insurance industry on Saturday , accusing it of using “ deceptive and dishonest ads ” to derail his health care legislation and threatening to strip the industry of its longstanding exemption from federal antitrust laws .
In unusually harsh terms , Mr. Obama cast insurance companies as obstacles to change interested only in preserving their own “ profits and bonuses ” and willing to “ bend the truth or break it ” to stop his drive to remake the nation ’s health care system .
The president used his weekly radio and Internet address to challenge industry assertions that legislation will drive up premiums .
“ It ’s smoke and mirrors , ” Mr. Obama said .
“ It ’s bogus .
And it ’s all too familiar .
Every time we get close to passing reform , the insurance companies produce these phony studies as a prescription and say , ‘ Take one of these , and call us in a decade . ’
Well , not this time . ”
Rather than trying to curb costs and help patients , he said , the industry is busy “ figuring out how to avoid covering people . ”
Because it seems like the plan was that they would all get captured and then Luke would save them .
There 's this whole thing that Luke is going to trade the droids for Han Solo , but I can't imagine that that was a good faith offer .
Leia unfreezes Han Solo , seemingly intending to sneak out of the palace , but that fails , and even if it had worked , you 've traded one captured ally for three -- the droids for Solo and Chewbacca .
Luke takes a blaster from a guard and tries to shoot Jabba , so maybe the plan was for Luke to take the palace by force , but why endanger the others ?
I 'm aware that there 's probably not an answer to this other than " it 's a dumb movie , " but I 'm often amazed at the ability of Star Wars fans and critics to make sense of the senseless pieces of these movies , and I 've never read a satisfying explanation for this .
Anybody have any ideas or know of any sources that shed light ?
I watched a film called " Return Of The Jedi " recently .
Perhaps some of you have seen it .
In the first act , a motley band of heroes executes an ingenious plan to rescue a comrade from an obese crime lord .
Wait , what exactly was their ingenious plan ?
For more than a century , soft drink manufacturers have been well aware that it helps to add an addictive drug to get customers hooked on their product .
It is many years since cocaine has been added to colas as a matter of practice .
Now it has become standard to add caffeine .
Caffeine alone has an unattractively bitter taste but this is always masked in a soft drink by mixing in sugar or an artificial sweetener , plus some flavouring such as citric acid for a lemon flavour .
Caffeine can have subtle effects in a drink .
A recent experimental study at the University of Sussex in Britain looked at how a liking for particular flavoured drinks can develop .
Participants were given two types of drink to sample , both with distinctive but novel flavours .
Only one contained caffeine - at a much lower concentration than that of many of the so - called '' energy drinks ' ' commercially available today .
After about a week , participants were asked to rate how much they liked each drink .
The one containing caffeine was given much higher ratings , even though the participants could not tell which drink contained caffeine .
Adding caffeine had conditioned an increased liking for the associated flavour , without the participants being aware this was happening .
Until recently , the concentration of caffeine in soft drinks remained relatively low .
The caffeine content of most colas today is about the same as that of an average cup of tea .
But with the advent of '' energy drinks ' ' there has been a progressive rise in concentration .
STEPHEN HAWKING IS ALIVE AND WELL … .
The estimable Jay Bookman discovered this unintentionally - hilarious item in the Investor ’s Business Daily on health care reform .
The headline reads , “ How House Bill Runs Over Grandma . ”
The U.K. ’s National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence ( NICE ) basically figures out who deserves treatment by using a cost-utility analysis based on the “ quality adjusted life year . ”
One year in perfect health gets you one point .
Deductions are taken for blindness , for being in a wheelchair and so on .
The more points you have , the more your life is considered worth saving , and the likelier you are to get care .
People such as scientist Stephen Hawking would n’t have a chance in the U.K. , where the National Health Service would say the life of this brilliant man , because of his physical handicaps , is essentially worthless .
Human Events , the right - wing magazine , lauded this IBD piece for having “ exposed the Achilles ’ heel of Obamacare . ”
Now , it might be tempting to respond to the IBD piece by noting that the health care reform proposal backed by Democrats is in no way similar to the British health care system , so these mind - numbing comparisons do n’t make any sense .
That , of course , would be a fair response .
But let ’s not overlook the punch - line here .
As Bookman noted , “ Of course , that same Stephen Hawking who would n’t have a chance in the United Kingdom was in fact born in the United Kingdom , has lived his entire life in the United Kingdom and lives there still today , at the ripe old age of 67 .
( He was in fact hospitalized earlier this month . )
Hawking is , you might say , living , breathing proof that these people are first - class fools . ”
Ever wonder what the reform debate would be like if conservatives approached it with a shred of intellectual seriousness ?
Tragedy " resides in the solemnity of the remorseless working of things , " declared philosopher Alfred North Whitehead in Science and the Modern World ( 1925 ) .
And few things are more tragic in the policy world than the current spectacle of private health insurers destroying their industry , and along with it , hope for a future of dynamic and innovative medical care .
In just a few short days , shortsighted actions by the health insurance industry and its lobbyists have resurrected congressional proposals for a government - run health insurance scheme , the so - called public option .
On Saturday , a front page article in the New York Times reported that small businesses are seeing their health insurance premiums go up an average of about 15 percent for the coming year — double the rate of previous year 's increases .
Apparently , insurers are trying to revive their stock prices and top up their coffers before health care reform legislation passes later this fall .
Opponents of private health insurance quickly seized on these reported price increases .
" This underlines the urgent need for health insurance reform , including a public option , " said Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) .
Congressional Democrats provided the health insurers with another opportunity for public self - immolation by proposing to repeal the health insurance industry 's antitrust exemption under the McCarran - Ferguson Act .
That Act also allows states to regulate the business of insurance without federal government interference .
Congress passed the McCarran - Ferguson
Act in 1945 in response to a Supreme Court ruling that insurance could be regulated by the federal government as interstate commerce under the Commerce Clause of the U.S. Constitution .
By conferring a regulatory monopoly on each state , the McCarran - Ferguson
Act ends up protecting insurance companies from interstate competition — residents may not buy policies from insurers located outside their state .
Because health insurers are insulated against out - of - state competition , state insurance commissions and legislatures feel free to impose coverage mandates that significantly drive up policy premiums .
The proliferation of hundreds of state health insurance mandates and regulations also serves as effective barriers to entry for potential competitors .
An insurance company trying to enter a new market would have to meet all of a state 's mandates .
At the same time , the company would have less negotiating clout with doctors and hospitals , which means it would have to pay providers more for their services .
In addition , a new entrant trying to attract policyholders would have to charge lower premiums than the incumbent companies to gain a foothold .
So a would - be competitor must pay more to health care providers while earning less from policyholders .
Given these mandated barriers , insurance companies have found that the easiest way to enter to a new state is to buy another company that is already operating in the market .
It is this dynamic that is driving the trend toward consolidation in health insurance markets .
The American Medical Association ( AMA ) sponsored an analysis in 2007 that looked at the concentration of health insurance companies [ PDF ] in 313 metropolitan areas .
To gauge the level of competition among insurers in the health insurance industry in each area , the AMA study used a Justice Department antitrust benchmark , the Herfindahl - Hirschman Index .
A score above 1,000 shows " moderate " concentration .
Those scoring above 1,800 yield a " high " concentration , suggesting that there is very little competition in the area .
The analysis showed that 96 percent of the 313 HMO / PPO ( health maintenance organizations / preferred provider organizations ) metropolitan markets studied were above the 1,800 threshold .
The AMA is not exactly a disinterested party when it comes to health insurers , however .
The medical credentialing board has a complicated relationship and a long history of conflict with health insurers .
But others have found that fewer health insurance competitors in a market mean higher policy prices as well .
A 2008 study by Kellogg School of Management professor Leemore Dafny found that local markets with fewer than six insurance carriers charged higher group health premiums .
Dafny 's study also found that " markets with 6 or fewer carriers increased dramatically over time , from 7 percent in 1998 to 23 percent in 2005 . "
She added , " Concentration has only increased since . "
In 38 states , the largest insurance company controlled one - third or more of the market and in 16 states the largest firm controlled more than half the market , according to a 2004 study by University of California - Berkeley health care economist James Robinson .
Robinson also noted that during this period of increasing consolidation from 2000 through 2003 saw double digit growth in insurance company premiums , earnings , and equity share prices .
Insurance premium prices annually grew 1.5 to 2 percent faster than their costs .
Last week , the House Judiciary Committee voted to narrow the McCarran - Ferguson antitrust exemption .
However , many analysts think that action will have , at most , a minor effect on improving competition among insurers .
In fact , National Underwriters newsletter reported that the Moody 's rating service does " not believe it would fundamentally change the way health insurers operate or lessen the barriers to entry and change the competitive landscape . "
Changing the competitive landscape , University of Illinois law professor David Hyman argues , requires amending the McCarran - Ferguson Act to allow for jurisdictional competition in health insurance regulation .
Insurance companies would pick the state under which they want their policies to be regulated and then would be allowed to sell their policies in all other states .
" The goal is to identify the ' Delaware ' of health insurance regulation , " Hyman says .
That is , to allow the market to find the state whose health insurance regulations are the most reasonable balance between protecting the interests of both shareholders and policyholders .
This proposal would create a national market in health insurance coverage and help keep premiums low .
Neither Congress nor the health insurance lobby favors such proposals .
Which brings us back to the remorseless working of things .
If the Democratic proposal to change the McCarran - Ferguson
Act is just an empty populist gesture and would not really increase competition among health insurers nor reduce their profits , would n't this be a good time for health insurance lobbyists to maintain decorous silence ?
That did n't happen .
The chief health insurance lobbying group , America 's Health Insurance Plans , opposes even this half - hearted repeal of the antitrust exemption .
By kicking up a fuss , they have handed the Democratic leadership another occasion to demonize hapless health insurers for being anti-competitive and giving proponents of government run health insurance additional rhetorical ammunition for justifying the creation of a public option .
The truth is that companies do n't want competition ; they want government guaranteed profits .
Mesmerized by the prospect that an individual insurance mandate would provide them with tens of millions of new government - subsidized customers , private health insurers have allowed themselves to be maneuvered into an inexorable process that will lead to their destruction .
In 2004 , Berkeley economist Robinson warned that double digit growth in premiums and profits was unsustainable .
" In the long term , health insurance will be either revitalized by the private sector , through product innovation and competitive entry , " wrote Robinson , " or disciplined by the public sector , through purchasing power and regulatory requirements . "
Five years later , health insurers are about to experience public sector discipline with a vengeance .
Make no mistake about it :
The government - run public insurance option will eventually out - compete private health insurers by means of the simple expedient of Medicare - style price controls on physicians and hospitals .
Under the guise of advocating choice and competition , the Obama administration and congressional Democrats are , in reality , pushing the country inevitably toward a single payer government health insurance scheme .
The result will be rationed patient care and drastically slowed medical innovation .
Now that 's remorselessly tragic .

Natasha Cann endured the Father 's Day from hell on Sunday when hackers broke into her Facebook account and proceeded to scam her closest friends out of significant amounts of money .
The 34 - year - old professional who works for BHP Billiton in South Australia - and used to work in IT for the military - thought her account was locked down but the painful reality hit her on Sunday night when a friend phoned her from Singapore .
Natasha Cann ... victim of a Facebook scam .
The friend had just received a Facebook message , purportedly from Cann , saying she had been seriously assaulted and robbed at gunpoint in London and urgently needed money to get home .
The message , which was sent to all of Cann 's 400 friends , asked for an initial amount of $ 10,000 , which had to be wired in cash as soon as possible to a Western Union account .
Younger children who play video games are more likely than older kids to report pain in their hands and fingers , according to research sparked by the curiosity of an 11 - year - old Missouri gamer .
" One day , I was squeezing orange juice when my thumb started hurting , and I asked my dad if I was going to get arthritis or tendinitis and which causes more pain : i Touch or Game Boy , " Deniz Ince , 11 , explained in a media release .
" He replied , ' Honestly , I do n't know . '
After this I wanted to find out if my friends were experiencing similar pain , " said Ince , whose father is a rheumatologist .
Ince and a research team lead by Dr. Yusuf Yazici administered questionnaires to 171 children ages seven to 12 at an elementary school in St. Louis , Mo. , concerning their use of consoles including Xbox , Play Station , Wii and iPhones .
The study found younger children were more likely to report increased pain , with seven - year - olds reporting the most .
Additionally , researchers noted that playing a Wii exclusively resulted in more self - reported pain .
Based on the research , minimum ages for playing games could be a consideration in the future , said Dr. Yazici , an assistant professor in the department of rheumatology at New York University Hospital for Joint Diseases .
" Our study suggests that a significant portion of children playing with game consoles experience hand and wrist pain , which may not be recognized , " Yazici said in a news release .
About 49 per cent of participants reported using game consoles for up to one hour a day .
Just over 40 per cent reported using them up to three hours a day , and 6.4 per cent more than three hours a day .
Nearly 12 percent of children overall reported finger pain and nearly 10 percent reported wrist pain that limited the amount of time they were able to play video games .
The study was presented this week at the American College of Rheumatology 's Annual Scientific Meeting in Philadelphia .
Two of the three Democrats charged with producing a Senate healthcare bill to take to the floor – Senate majority leader Harry Reid of Nevada and Sen. Christopher Dodd of Connecticut – face tough reelection bids in 2010 .
Senate leaders are used to being lightening rods .
But the overhaul of the US healthcare system sets up a perfect storm of competing interests , especially for Democrats .
As leader of a 60 - member majority , Senator Reid has the votes to move major legislation .
But his caucus is divided on issues ranging from costs of the plan to the scope of a public option .
This week , progressive activists rallied outside Senator Reid ’s office building to call for the expulsion of moderates who vote against the bill .
Liberal bloggers ramped up calls for Reid ’s dismissal if he fails to include a robust public option .
Labor unions called on Democrats to reject a proposed tax on generous health plans – something moderate Democrats deem essential .
At the same time , Reid has to keep an eye on politics at home , where constituents face one of the highest unemployment and foreclosure rates in the nation .
Last month , Reid improved the health bill for Nevada by winning assurances that Nevada would be one of only four states to be fully funded by the federal government for the first five years of expansion of Medicaid – a key element in plans to expand health coverage .
Reid pledged to Nevadans that state budgets would not be hard hit by this new requirement .
Asked today whether carrying the load for the Democrats as majority was worth ending his career in the Senate , Reid said , “ All my polling numbers are fine , and I ’m continuing to do the best I can for the people of this country and the people of Nevada . ”
But political analysts say that Reid ’s approval ratings are are registering only in the mid-30s against lesser known challengers .
On Sunday , a Mason Dixon poll commissioned by the Las Vegas Review Journal had Reid losing to Nevada Republican chairwoman Sue Lowden by 10 points and to GOP businessman Danny Tarkanian by 5 points .
“ His poll numbers are terrible .
Why else would he go to the air 383 days before the election ? ” says Nevada political analyst Jon Ralston .
Reid ’s campaign launched its first television ads Thursday in Las Vegas and Reno .
Vice President Joseph Biden joins Reid for a fundraiser in Reno on Friday .
The last Democrat to serve as Senate majority leader , Sen . Tom Daschle ( D ) of South Dakota , lost his 2004 reelection bid – an outcome that stunned Senate Democrats .
The last Senate Democratic leader to lose a reelection bid had been in 1952 .
“ Senator Reid and Daschle share a problem .
One of them is that when you have to lead your party at a national level , it ’s hard to go home and run as a moderate , ” says Jennifer Duffy , who analyzes Senate races for the Cook Political Report .
Senator Dodd , who led the markup of healthcare reform legislation in the Senate Health , Education , Labor , and Pensions Committee , also faces the race of his life in Connecticut .
As chair of the Banking , House , and Urban Affairs Committee , he is also leading negotiations over financial regulation that could also play in his reelection campaign .
Dodd ’s poll numbers are improving , but his approval ratings are still below 50 percent .
He trails former US Rep . Rob Simmons 44 to 39 percent in a possible matchup , according to a Quinnipiac University poll last month .
“ A lot of his problems stem from actions he ’s already taken , ” says Cook Political Report analyst Ms. Duffy .
He ’s hearing from voters that “ you were supposed to be watching and instead you were off running for president and kind of abandoned the ship .
This happened on your watch . ”
Healthcare is another high profile opportunity to shine at home – or not , she says .
" This year alone , 28,000 people in the state of Connecticut have lost their health care because of unemployent .
In the last nine years in my state , premium costs have gone from around $ 6,000 for a family of four to around $ 12,000 a year , and every indication is those numbers are going to keep going up , " Dodd said at a briefing with reporters on Wednesday , as closed - door talks began .
" We have no other choice than to get this accomplished , " he said .

This is a wonderful game .
Its atmosphere and graphics are what grab you at first and make you want to see what it 's all about .
I 've been playing it all weekend , which says something about its ability to suck you in .
I have n't been that hooked on a game since I got Oblivion 2 years ago .
Let 's face it , the market was long overdue for a professional , polished city builder that people could get into and get to love .
It 's got one flawed and frustrating system and a few other annoyances , but that 's understandable since there 's a fine line between challenge and broken mechanics - mostly you 're just concentrating on dictating effectively and staying in power .
Which is an awesome and unique theme that completely captures the feel of a small time dictatorship .
As long as you 're not afraid of looking up the fine points on the internet , get this game already .

This week my colleagues and I will try again to extend the badly needed payments for another 13 weeks .
It is my hope that Republicans will drop their obstruction and join with us to extend unemployment benefits to tens of thousands of hardworking Americans .
With almost 14 million people unemployed around the country , the U.S. unemployment rate is approaching 10 percent ; right here in New York , it 's 8.9 % and 10.3 % in New York City .
Without an extension , tens of thousands of New Yorkers and about a million of our long - term unemployed nationwide will lose benefits by the end of the year .
We must not allow this to happen , especially as the holidays approach .
As our economic recovery continues to take shape , it 's crucial that we not forget about those families who are hurting the most , still struggling to find work in a very difficult job market .
When I travel throughout New York , I speak to many who are struggling .
They tell me how hard they are looking for jobs , that there simply are n't any .
When there is a job opening , hundreds of applicants show up and line up around the block for a chance to get hired .
These are hard working people who would much prefer to work to put food on their table rather than accept a check from the government .
But until our economy recovers to a point where it 's creating jobs at a sustainable pace , we must step in to help .
ADVERTISEMENT
Extending unemployment benefits is not only the morally right thing to do , it is good economic policy in a recession .
These unemployment benefits not only put money in the hands of those that need it most , but they are immediately stimulative to the economy , as families use the funds for the most critical needs .
So far this year in New York alone , 70,000 people in the Rochester / Finger Lakes region have collected unemployment benefits , 78 % of whom relied on those benefits for their basic necessities ; in the Hudson Valley region , more than 90,000 collected the benefits , 68 % of whom relied on that income for their basic needs ; more than 125,000 Long Island residents collected unemployment benefits , 76 % of whom relied on that money to support their families ; and in New York City , nearly 400,000 people collected unemployment benefits , 67 % of whom relied on that money for their basic needs .
The job market is historically the last step of an economic recovery , forcing the unemployed to bear the brunt of the recession the longest and making it increasingly difficult to find new work .
It 's simply unfair and unreasonable to ask them to bear this burden without assistance , and I hope Republicans will stop obstructing and join us in helping our fellow Americans in their time of need .

The UK is launching an official inquiry into the Iraq War today .
Olier Miles , former British Ambassador to Libya , said in the 11/22/09 issue of The Independent " the key question - is Blair a war criminal . "
If he is a war criminal , Blair was is certainly a well paid one .
He 's an advisor to J.P. Morgan and Zurich Financial Services and makes up to 150,000 British Pounds per speech .
Total annual income : 5 million British Pounds per year plus a 7 million British Pound advance for his memoirs .
Poland signs up to new US shield

Advertisement Polish Prime Minister Donald
Tusk has declared his country ready to take part in a revised US missile defence plan .
Mr Tusk told visiting US Vice - President Joe Biden that Poland was " ready to participate " .
Poland will now host a small US base equipped with short - range missiles .
It replaces a much bigger system favoured by former President George W Bush .
Mr Biden insisted the new system was better than the old version and would mean " better security for Poland " .
President Barack Obama 's decision to scrap Bush - era plans to build a defence system in Poland and the Czech Republic caused some alarm in those countries .
The White House 's decision to reset its relations with Moscow , which had vehemently opposed the plan , led some to wonder whether Washington was still listening to Central and Eastern Europe 's concerns about Russia , says the BBC's Adam Easton in Poland .
Mr Biden 's visit is meant to reassure those countries that America 's commitment is unwavering , our correspondent says .
He will travel from Poland on to Romania and the Czech Republic .
The US has reconfigured its plans to protect against " rogue " states After meeting the Polish prime minister Mr Biden said : " We appreciate Poland has stepped up and agreed to host an element of the previous missile defence plan , and we now appreciate that Poland 's government agrees with us that there is now a better way ... with new technology and new information , to defend against emerging ballistic missile threats .
" It 's going to meet it with proven technology that will cover more of Europe , including Poland , and will do it more efficiently than the previous system could have or did .
" Simply put , our missile plan is better security for Nato and is better security for Poland . "
The new missile system could be installed by 2015 .

In the past days I worked intensively on Antivirus ’s Device Drivers bugs , at the actual state of art the major part of well known AVs suffer of basical and more hidden bugs .
The totality of AVs that I ’ve checked presents defects that could be maliciously used to takeover an Antivirus Infrastructure and in some case the entire Operating System with attacks like DoS and / or Remote / Local Privilege Escalation .
I want to make a precisation here , exists an important difference between Bug and Vulnerability , simply bugs does not affects the integrity of a system and does not constitute a true danger .
Vulnerabilities constitutes an effective risk for systems integrity , included informations contained inside it .
When we are dealing with applications specifically devoted to security , every bug could be considered a vulnerability , because an attacker could block / kill overcome checks performed by the application itself and propagate in system and produce damages .
Just think to a basical crash that could affect an Antivirus could be implemented into a malicious application that checks the presence of AVs and induces the bug .
In this little post we are going to see some defects of last device drivers used by Avast , I ’m precisely talking of
Build Number : 4.8.1351.0
Avast loads the following drivers :
Aasvmker4.sys
aswMon2.sys
aswRdr.sys
aswSP.sys
Avast loads the following Drivers could be tested by fuzzing IOCTLs , for this task could be used IOCTL Fuzzer and Kartoffel .
Let ’s disassemble the first driver , Aavmker4.sys that from DeviceIoControl hook appears to be heavy used .
This is the DriverEntry ( ) drivers
00010748 mov eax , [ ebp+DriverObject ]
0001074B push offset NotifyRoutine ; NotifyRoutine
00010750 mov dword ptr [ eax +70h ] , offset sub_1098C ; DriverObject->MajorFunction [ 14 ] = ( PDRIVER_DISPATCH) sub_1098C ;
00010757 call PsSetCreateProcessNotifyRoutine
sub_1098C contains the switch statement to handle various IOCTL notifications , essentially IOCTL check is structured in form of nested If and Switches .
001098C ; int __stdcall sub_1098 C ( int , PIRP Irp )
000109C4 mov ecx , 0B2D6002Ch
000109C9 cmp eax , ecx
000109 CB ja loc_10D12
000109D1 jz loc_10CE9
Checks if IOCTL is less or equal to 0x0B2D6002C , if condition is true checks if IOCTL is exactly 0x0B2D6002C a certain task is performed by the device driver and finally ends with a classical
epilogue :
IofCompleteRequest( X , 0 ) ;
return value ;
By monitoring Aavmker4.sys activity , with a DeviceIoControl hook emerges that the most used IOCTLs are :
0xB2D60030
0xB2D60034
Now we have two possibilities the first is to fuzz these IOCTLs and check crash dump if happens and after check code for more details , the second possibility is to invert the check order .
This the xml configuration to test Aavmker4.sys
< allow >
< drivers >

If buffer size differs from 878h Dbg Prints an error message , else supplied buffer is correctly sanitized via MmUserProbeAddress , MmIsAddressValid .
We can say that this IOCTL is correctly handled .
0xB2D60034 :

Now let ’s test aswSP.sys .
In Device Driver vulnerabilty research it ’s fundamental to have a complete log of all activities of a driver , this can be obtained by correctly planning a battery of test unit .
Each test should correspond to a primitive logic operation performed by an application that makes use of driver .
I usually build several mini logs for each activity and finally a complete log .
Here a little list of monitoring primitives :
On Load
On apparent Idle
On Working
On Shutdown
Various , like On Surprise Stop
This will give us a complete report of all activities and involved IOCTL .
In the specific case of asw Mon2.sys we can isolate the following :
0xb2c80018
0xb2c80014
0xb2c80020
0xB2c800C0
0xB2c800C4
0xB2c800C8
From IOCTL
Logger we can see that 0xB2c800C0 is heavly used , time to locate Ioctl Dispatcher :
0001178B and dword ptr [ ebx+34h ] , 0
0001178 F mov dword ptr [ ebx+6Ch ] , offset sub_11FB6
00011796 mov dword ptr [ ebx+28h ] , offset off_18988
C like :
v2->DriverUnload = 0 ;
v2->MajorFunction [ 13 ] = ( PDRIVER_DISPATCH) sub_11FB6 ;
v2->FastIoDispatch = ( PFAST_IO_DISPATCH ) &unk_18988 ;
with a bit of research we land to sub_10B82 that contains the switch for Ioctls .
00010 BBD mov eax , 0B2C80018h
00010BC2 cmp ecx , eax
00010BC4 push edi
00010BC5 ja loc_11066
00010 BCB jz loc_10F70
00010BD1 cmp ecx , 0B2C80008h
00010BD7 jz short loc_10C3C
00010BD9 cmp ecx , 0B2C8000Ch
00010 BDF jz short loc_10C16
00010BE1 cmp ecx , 0B2C80010h
00010BE7 jz short loc_10BFF
00010BE9 cmp ecx , 0B2C80014h
00010 BEF jnz loc_111AC
00010BF5 call sub_108BC
00010BFA jmp loc_11055
From logs emerged that the most frequently used is 0B2C8000C so it ’s obvious that we will study this for first :
0xB2C8000C :
00010C16 cmp [ ebp+arg_C ] , 1448h
00010C1D jnz loc_111AC ; check len
00010C23 mov esi , [ ebp+SourceString ]
00010C26 mov ecx , 512h
00010C2B mov edi , offset dword_18A58
00010C30 rep movsd
00010C32 call sub_108F0
00010C37 jmp loc_112C1 ; go out
In this case user supplied input is correctly sanitized , so 0xB2C8000C can be excluded from fuzz testing .
From the log On Shutdown emerged the massive presence of 0xB2c80018 , so let ’s fuzz it .
Here the configuration for IOCTL Fuzzer :
<?xml version = ” 1.0 ″ encoding = ” windows -1251 ″ ?>
< cfg >
< log_file>C:\ioctls.txt</log_file >
< hex_dump>true</hex_dump >
< log_requests > true</log_requests >
< debug_log_requests>true</debug_log_requests >
< fuze_requests >true</fuze_requests >
< fuze_size>true</fuze_size >
< allow >
< drivers >
< entry>aswMon2.SYS</entry >
</drivers >
< devices >
< entry >\Device\aswMon</entry >
</ devices >
< ioctls >
< entry > 0xb2c80018</entry >
</ioctls >
< processes >
< entry>ashServ.exe </entry >
</ processes >
</ allow >

< entry > 0xb2c80014</entry >
< entry > 0xb2c80020</entry >
</ioctls >
</deny >
</cfg >
The config script allows only 0xB2c80018 sent from aswMon , other drivers are locked .
Obviously fuzzing need to follow the log unit that evidenced out IOCTL , so run fuzzer and stop all Avast services .
Bang ..a BSOD , discovered an Avast vulnerability into aswMon2.sys 🙂

Many of China 's rural workers earn far less than urban ones
The Chinese government is to introduce a new pension scheme for the country 's hundreds of millions of rural workers .
The minister for social security announced that a trial scheme would be extended across China by October .
The government will pay for basic insurance for rural workers and farmers will contribute to a pension pot .
There is widespread discontent among China 's rural poor about the wide disparity between their income compared to that of urban residents .
The government already operates a basic pension plan for urban workers .
Regional variations
" The new system is paid for by farmers , collective benefits and government subsidy , which is totally different from the old system , paid for by farmers themselves , with no subsidy from the government , " Hu Xiaoyi said , according to state news agency , Xinhua .
I feel happy that farmers can get a pension now , although it 's not that much
Chen Dajin , farmer
Jobless pose ' grave crisis '
The scheme will be valid for all farmers over 60 .
Anyone over the age of 16 who does not take part in the government 's existing urban pension scheme is eligible to pay into the programme .
A pilot version of the scheme is currently being trialled across some parts of China , including in Tangwei country , in Suzhou .
" I feel happy that farmers can get a pension now , although it 's not that much , " 63 - year - old Chen Dajin , from the area , told Xinhua .
The payment will vary regionally and be based on average local income .
He and his wife receive 300 yuan ( $ 43 ) in pension payments each month .
On Tuesday , the government said it would seek to stimulate domestic demand .
Authorities have been attempting to improve both pensions and medical insurance , in a bid to encourage farmers and poorer urban workers to spend a larger proportion of their income .
According to figures released on Tuesday , although the country 's jobless rate remains unchanged , some three million graduates have not yet found work .

KABUL , Afghanistan  Fourteen Americans were killed in Afghanistan on Monday in two crashes involving helicopters , making it one of the deadliest days in America ’s eight - year war here .
Neither crash appeared to involve hostile fire , American military officials said .
The American casualties occurred amid fresh tensions between Afghan politicians over a runoff presidential election scheduled for Nov. 7 .
In the most lethal of the two crashes , seven American servicemen and three agents with the United States Drug Enforcement Administration died when their Chinook twin - rotor helicopter crashed in western Afghanistan after a firefight with Taliban insurgents .
Twenty - six people were injured : 11 American servicemen , one American civilian and 14 Afghan soldiers .
The crash followed a gun battle with insurgents that broke out when the Americans and Afghans raided a compound believed to harbor drug traffickers .
The Americans and the Afghans killed more than a dozen fighters , military officials in Kabul said .
The Chinook crashed as the American and Afghan forces were leaving .
Are n’t you all a little tired of the Phillies and their fans destroying each other ?

This combined with the reduction in administrative overhead costs , the savings associated with an emphasis on preventative medicine , and other measures will provide us as individual consumers and as a nation with substantial long term cost savings .
According to the Congressional Budget Office , the health care reform bill will cut the deficit by over $ 30 billion over the next decade and will continue to create a surplus over the next 20 years .
Yesterday ’s plan also includes a public option that , while not as expansive I would have liked , is still very worthy of support .
And as most of you are well aware , we had an unfortunate setback for women ’s health in yesterday ’s voting .
But on the whole , this is change we can believe in .
When I was California ’s Insurance Commissioner , my staff fielded thousands of calls from California residents who fell victim to the insurance industry shenanigans .
When large fires hit San Diego , Oakland , and elsewhere , hundreds of consumers were victimized a second time by their insurance companies .
My capable staff was successful at coming to a consumer - friendly resolution for almost all cases , but at times , I had to personally ring up high ranking industry executives to use all forms of persuasion available to my office to make sure my constituents were treated fairly .
When one ’s business model depends on collecting monthly payments from people in the hope that you ’ll never have to provide them with the services they are paying you for , it ’s disappointing but not shocking that the insurance industry looks for loopholes to maximize its profits .
It is from this motivation that we get babies denied health insurance because they ’re " too fat " and women kicked off their insurance after requesting payment for emergency gallbladder surgery because their husbands failed to report high cholesterol .
That ’s why government intervention is sometimes necessary , to make sure the invisible hand of the market does n’t become a closed fist .
In my run for Congress , I told anyone who asked that I was ecstatic to have the opportunity to return to Washington , DC to cast one of my first votes for comprehensive health care reform that includes the public option .
This week , I ’m traveling to Livermore for my first town hall as a Congressman , and I will have four more through the month of December ( at least one will be virtual , stay tuned ) .
Given the rise in the unemployed and uninsured in my district , I expect many grateful supporters , but I also expect some naysayers .
I am prepared to defend my vote , because I know it is best for my constituents and will help save lives .
I also know most of my constituents have my back .
After all , most of us know a friend or family member who has been on the wrong end of insurance industry malfeasance .
Listen to my floor speech here to hear about what one friend of mine is going through .
We still have a big fight ahead of us in the Senate , and I encourage all of you to call your Senators and demand they pass a good comprehensive health care reform bill that includes the public option .
With helpful endorsements from the AARP and American Medical Association , and with two different congressional districts affirming their support for comprehensive health care reform in elections last week , momentum is on our side .
So thanks again for all you ’ve done to make this bill a reality ; believe me , it ’s noticed .
After the health care debate , we will move on to other big issues facing the nation : transportation , job creation , No Child Left Behind , troop placements , and the list goes on .
If we pass comprehensive health care reform this year , it will mark the end of an important chapter in our nation ’s history : the 40 + years between the passage of Medicare and the subsequent years we failed to live up to our country ’s promise , letting millions of Americans live and die without adequate coverage .
It will also mark the beginning of a new chapter : the years it will take us to lower the age of Medicare eligibility from 65 to 0 .
I ’m hopeful we can beat four decades .

On the streets of Alexander City , Alabama , you wo n't find a single person with a bad word to say about Dr George W Hardy .
" He is just the most authentic , alive person " , rhapsodises one friend .
" He 's always smiling and he likes people " , adds another .
Even his ex-wife struggles to find a flaw in his character .
" I ca n't think of one person who does n't like George Hardy " , she says , a little pensively .
" It would be pretty hard not to like George . "
It 's all the more remarkable , really , when you consider that Hardy is the local dentist not commonly a front - runner for the most popular guy in town .
But Hardy , a gentle , grinning beefcake of a man with a blond sweep of hair and teeth as straight and white as a picket fence , is loved by his employees , admired by the local bigwigs for his charitable work and adored by the townsfolk , not least for his turn in the Christmas parade where , year in , year out , he steals the show as a zany , rollerblading tooth fairy .
No , you wo n't find a single person with a bad word to say about Dr George W Hardy in Alexander City , Alabama .
Unless , that is , you happen to mention Troll 2 .

" Oh mah garrsh ! " whispers his mother , visibly paling .
" We do n't speak too much about that ... "
That would be Hardy 's turn in the ill - fated 1989 horror movie , Troll 2 .
Hardy plays Michael Waits , square - jawed patriarch of a perfect family who set off on holiday to the country idyll of Nilbog ( read it backwards ) .
There they find themselves at the mercy of a village full of paradoxically blood - thirsty vegetarian goblins who plan to turn them into plants and then feed , orgiastically , on their sap .
" I left in the middle .
I just could n't take any more " , admits Hardy 's mother .
" Let 's say he 's no Cary Grant . "
" His accent , his acting ... it's all just sooo bad " , adds a friend .
If the opprobrium heaped upon Hardy 's acting debut by his nearest and dearest sounds harsh , it 's nothing compared to the derision that has greeted the movie around the world and in cyberspace since its release ( straight to VHS , naturally ) 20 years ago .
It has a rating of 0 per cent on the film - critic website Rotten Tomatoes .
To put this in perspective , Plan 9 from Outer Space , for many years thought to be the worst crime ever committed to celluloid , gets a whopping 62 ; Paris Hilton 's movie debut House of Wax scores a respectable 26 ; the Mariah Carey car - crash vehicle Glitter has 7 ; even Bennifer 's disastrous outing in Gigli scrapes 6 .
Meanwhile , on IMDb , the film has been given its own strand , " Worst Movie Ever Made ? " , where the bilious comments number well into the hundreds .
" Someone mentioned that they would vote for a 0 , well I would like to go beyond that and give this film a - 0 " , says one disgruntled viewer .
" Suffice it to say that , if you set any cast member on fire , I would lay down even money that he or she would have a hard time convincing onlookers that it hurt . "
It is , sums up another comment , " simply the perfect storm of bad writing , casting , direction , cinematography , costuming , score , makeup , effects , acting , editing , and inspiration " .
It is also now the subject of a new documentary , Best Worst Movie , which has its UK premiere at Sheffield Doc / Fest next week .
Troll 2 is an astonishingly inept film .
The plot is insane , the dialogue clunky , the acting even before the humans are transformed into shrubs painfully wooden and the effects shoddy .
There is a cinematic first , surely a sex scene inexplicably involving a corn on the cob and a character called Creedence Leonore Gielgud .
The goblins are relentlessly unthreatening wobbly dwarves dressed in pillow - filled potato sacks with immovable latex Hallowe 'en masks their killing sprees drenched in lurid goo the colour of crme de menthe .
And , if we 're being really picky , there are no trolls in Troll 2 not one .
The film was originally made as Goblins but , aware it had a Four Christmases - sized turkey , the studio changed the title for its American release , hoping to align it with the popular 1986 horror movie Troll and perhaps gain some hapless , unsuspecting viewers along the way .
Its Italian director Claudio Fragasso has form , having been involved in similarly bogus sequels Terminator II and Evil Dead V .
For Troll 2 , Fragasso cast mainly non-actors from Utah , where the three - week , $ 200,000 , sweltering summer shoot took place .
The cast lived off stale pizza , went back to their day - jobs between takes and were expected to provide their own costumes .
No -one could understand the script or the Italian production crew .
Don Packard , given the part of the Nilbog store owner shortly after being released from mental hospital , harboured murderous thoughts towards the child star .
It was , by all standards , a less than ideal shoot .
" We were really trying to make a good movie " , recalls Hardy .
It was to be his first and last acting job .
" I was in high - school plays , always in front of a crowd , pretty much a big ham .
I remember people patting me on the back when I was 17 years old and saying , ' you really ought to consider going into acting ' .
It was a dream of mine .
Of course I did n't have the opportunity to make my statement in Troll 2 .
People just say , 'oh , it 's one of the worst bits of acting ever ' .
But imagine no direction at all , no - one speaking English to you and just giving the script and telling you to read it . "
Does he regret it ?
" Fate has its own way .
Yes , it would have been great to have done something like Lord of the Rings .
You 're lucky if you 're cast first time in something like that . "
Hardy soon gave up his Hollywood dreams and went back to Alabama where he opened a private dental practice , got married and raised a family .
" I really did n't want to have much to do with Troll 2 .
I remember putting the VHS in the machine when it came out and seeing the first five minutes .
Honestly , I just could n't watch it .
I let dust collect on that copy for nearly 17 years . "
Then something strange happened .
Hardy , and others members of the cast , started to receive adoring messages on MySpace .
They were followed by videos of fans holding Troll 2 nights , with green - themed food and drink , tribute costumes and private screenings where party - goers could recite every line .
A Troll 2 Facebook fan page appeared and racked up 2,032 members .
Superfans in Austria sent in photographs of their goblin tattoos .
News came in of soldiers watching the film in Baghdad 's Green Zone .
Nilbog High became the first level in the PS2 video game Guitar Hero II .
Twenty years on , the worst movie ever made had quietly become a cult classic .
Michael Stephenson , the child star of Troll 2 who led the fight against the goblins armed only with advice from his dead grandpa 's ghost and a double - decker Bologna sandwich ( do n't ask ) , was the first to pick up on the phenomenon .
Only 10 years old when he landed his first acting role , for many years Stephenson , now 31 , had a " rough relationship " with the film .
" I thought that I was really going to be a star , that I was making the next Labyrinth or Gremlins .
I remember watching the VHS on Christmas morning and seven or eight seconds into it my dad put his head in his hands and said , ' Oh Michael , this is a terrible movie ' .
It was a Christmas I will never , never forget . "
In 2006 , Stephenson was working in LA , a jobbing actor and wannabe film - maker , when inspiration struck .
" I woke up one morning and I said to myself , smiling : ' Wait a minute !
I 'm the star of the worst movie ever made !
There 's a story here ...'
I had to do it . "
He contacted Hardy and together the pair went to the first public screening of Troll 2 at the Upright Citizens Brigade Theatre in New York .
Advertised on MySpace , it was a sell - out .
It was also the first time Hardy had watched the movie all the way through .
" I saw people embracing it .
It was like a virus that infected everyone .
They laughed with it and I thought , ' Oh my gosh , why do n't I laugh with them ? ' "
It was a cathartic experience , too , for Stephenson .
" I was fascinated by the impression that Troll 2 made on people .
Think of all those big Hollywood movies that spend ridiculous amounts of money and they 're just forgotten , days after their release .
When I was in the audience and saw people having an incredible time , I could n't deny how positive that felt . "
So Best Worst Movie was born , a tragic - comic film about the lives of those involved in Troll 2 and the afterlife of the movie .
It premiered at SXSW in March and is already picking up Best Documentary awards on the festival circuit .
With Stephenson hidden behind the camera , Hardy is its genial stand - out star .
" People went crazy when they saw George at the New York screening and I remember just looking at his face and seeing him brighten , just smile from ear to ear " , says Stephenson .
" I thought ' this is the guy ' .
He was in hometown Alabama yesterday filling cavities and now he 's appearing in front of 400 adoring fans . "
There are other extraordinary characters , too .
Connie Young , who played daughter Holly and still refuses to put Troll 2 on her CV ; Margo Prey , who played the mother , now a recluse who believes the film is comparable to a Humphrey Bogart and Katharine Hepburn classic " because it 's about people " ; fiery screenwriter ( and wife of the director ) , Rossella Drudi , who reveals that her script is partly an anti-vegetarianism tract .
" I had many friends who'd all become vegetarians and it pissed me off .
It 's a ferocious analysis of today 's society . "
And then there is Fragasso , a director who lives by the creed , " I do n't follow the critics and the critics do n't follow me " .
Blissfully unaware of the shortcomings of his film , he is baffled by the reaction to his work .
" When he came to the LA screening and saw the line for tickets , the first thing he said to me was : ' Ah Michael , we have to do a Troll 3 !
We have to start now ! " , says Stephenson .
It 's precisely this lack of cynicism which has seen Troll 2 become a much - loved cult classic .
" Troll 2 is not one of those films that set out to be so bad it 's good " , explains Stephenson .
" Everybody tried to succeed and we failed miserably .
There 's a brilliance in that .
I have a lot of respect for Claudio .
He made Troll 2 with all his heart .
The worst thing you can do is to fail to entertain and he does far from that . "
Best Worst Movie is in the tradition of fine pop-culture documentaries such as American Movie ( about the making of an independent horror movie ) , which scooped the Best Documentary Award at Sundance in 1999 ) and The King of Kong ( about one man 's bid to gain the highest ever score on the Donkey Kong video game ) .
It will screen as part of the new comedy strand at Sheffield Doc / Fest , now in its 16th year and one of the top three documentary film festivals in the world , attracting around 1,700 industry types to a programme which this year offers 120 films from 21 countries .
Big hitters showing their wares include Nick Broomfield , who will present A Time Comes : The Story of the Kingsnorth Six about the Greenpeace protesters who scaled Kingsnorth power station , while director Kim Longinotto will attend a screening of her Rough Aunties , about a group of women in South Africa who dedicate their lives to caring for abused children .
There 's also a chance to see Michael Moore 's Capitalism : A Love Story , Michel Gondry 's The Thorn in the Heart and Videocracy , Erik Gandini 's searing expos of Berlusconi's Italy .
Of the new generation , there will be keen interest in offerings from Broomfield and Longinotto juniors .
Barney Broomfield 's Far From
Gone is an intimate look at the lives of two Congolese refugees while Moby Longinotto 's
The Joneses is a charming 13 - minute account of a father who has a sex change after the death of his wife , thus becoming a replacement mother to their children .
Another premiere comes from Ivo Gormley , son of Antony , with a look at the gaming scene in Playmakers .
Other highlights include the opening film , Moving to Mars , about a Burmese family fleeing the bloody regime of their native country and settling in Sheffield .
The excellent Music and Arts strand has Jonathan Caouette 's on - and off - stage record of a decade of All Tomorrow 's Parties gigs and films about Woodstock , Anton Corbijn and an Arab - Jewish hip - hop group .
With further strands dedicated to Russian , sports and green documentaries , for five days the world will come to Sheffield with films on everything from the Texan petrochemical industry and dolphin culling in Japan to female taxi drivers in Moscow , child boxers in Cuba , gangs in London and teenage heroin addicts in Afghanistan .
There are movies about coal , clowns and the civil rights movement , about privacy , piracy , piano tuners and bigamous porn stars .
Aside from screenings ( which are free for students ) , there are also masterclasses with RJ Cutler ( The September Issue ) , Franny Armstrong ( The Age of Stupid ) and Storyville stalwart Leslie Woodhead .
" There 's no doubt that the industry is tougher now than it was a couple of years ago " , says Heather Croall , director of Doc / Fest .
" There is less money .
But instead of doom and gloom at Sheffield we 've tried to look at opportunities in new media and the international market . "
There has been a steady trickle of documentary successes over the last decade , from Moore 's polemics to thrillers Touching the Void and Man on Wire , and from environmental blockbusters An Inconvenient Truth and March of the Penguins to Spellbound and this year 's The September Issue .
" Before Bowling for Columbine in 2002 , there were really no documentaries in multiplexes " , says Croall .
" They were in art - house cinemas , if at all , or festivals .
Now you have The September Issue in a multiplex near you and maybe The Cove , too .
Every year there are around six documentaries that do good box office and show in suburban multiplexes : it 's amazing . "
Sometimes the very best stories are the true stories : " I like stories about people and I like great characters " , says Stephenson .
" I never considered myself a documentary maker before I made Best Worst Movie , or even wanted to be one , but I can now see why people start making them and never stop . "
The last word on the magic of documentary , though , should go to Hardy , the genre 's latest star - in - waiting .
" I 'm so honoured that I 've gone from one of the worst films ever made to one of the best documentaries that has come along in decades .
It 's a miracle . "

People do n't neglect backing up their computers because it 's hard — it is n't , at all .
No , people file into the inevitable death march of data loss for one reason : Backing up usually costs money .
But it does n't have to .

When your concerned friends and family insist that you have to back your data up ( as anyone who 's seen my atrociously beaten - down laptop in the last few months has done to me ) they 're effectively telling you two things :
That backing up your data will save you a massive headache in the future , because more likely the not , your hard drive will fail ; and , less bluntly , that you need to buy a hard drive .
And who wants to do that ?
It 's hard to lay out the cash for a backup hard drive , since the payoff is uncertain , and ( hopefully ) far away .
It 's a good investment — not an easy one .
The good news is , most of us cheapskates can still keep our most important files safe without spending a dime , or wasting more than a few minutes .
Here how :
Note :
These methods do n't give you traditional , full backups — they are ways to keep copies of the files that matter most to you , like your documents , photos , music and videos .

Do you live with someone else ?
Do you share a network with someone else ?
Then hey , you 've got an ready - built backup system right there !
There are a few ways to deal with this setup , from stupid - simple to moderately complex .
First , you need permission .
Whoever your networked buddy is , sit them down and have a talk .
Give them a glass of milk , and explain to them how important data backup is .
Persuade them .
Coax them .
Scare them .
Offer to store their backups in exchange for them storing yours .
Great !
Now you have a partner in data safety .
Congratulations .

The easiest , most direct and least intimidating way to get free backups is to set up simple file sharing on your PC or Mac .
On the PC , it 's just a matter of ticking a few boxes and setting a few parameters ( Windows XP , Windows Vista , Windows 7 ) and on Mac , it 's not much harder ( To another Mac , to a PC , courtesy of Lifehacker ) .

Now you need to decide what to back up , and how to do it .
If privacy is n't an issue , like in a scenario where you 're just syncing files between two open access family computers , you can simple copy your documents , photos , video and audio to opposing computers ' shared folders , and voila .
If privacy is an issue , like if you 're trying to back up sensitive documents or embarrassing photos , you can simply create a password - protected archive of some or all of your data , then copy that over to the backup folder .
Advertisement
But this is all a little manual for my taste — for a longer term solution , I 'd recommend something a little more automated .
All we need with such a simple setup is a basic backup utility .
For Windows , I 've been happy with IdleBackup , a free little utility that 'll copy selected folders to any destination you want — including network folders — while your computer is n't working .
For Mac , Lacie 's SilverKeeper is as simple and powerful a tool as you 'll need , syncing folders locally or over a network on a set schedule — also free .
Go Online

Again , short of purchasing a whole lot of online space especially designed for the purpose of storing full backups , this 'll be a scenario in which you 're picking a choosing what you save and what you do n't ; your intention here is to save and recover the files that matter most , not restore your entire operating system .
Luckily , with increasingly generous offers from online storage companies , you can put quite a bit of your stuff on someone else 's servers for nothing .
A few of the best :
Windows Live Skydrive :
This one really deserves more publicity that it seems to get , because it hands you 25 GB of no -strings - attached storage , for free .
The 50 MB filesize limit is a little low considering how large the online disk is , but for document , photo , and even music backup , it 's hard to beat this .
Advertisement
File Factory : 100GB of free storage with a 300 MB file limit .
The catch ?
It can be a little slow , so this much data is n't necessarily that usable .
Dropbox :
This is more than just a backup service — it has plenty of nifty file syncing and features , too — but it 's a super - simple way to store 2GB of data online , with well - designed clients on every major platform
Advertisement
Mozy : Gives you 2GB of storage for free , or an unlimited amount for $ 5 a month .
Comes with an extremely handy Windows utility that makes it easy to specify what gets uploaded , and what does n't .
Orbit Files : Offers 6GB of space , but with fewer options available for non-paying customers , and no software client .

Scatter Yourself
In the Cloud
The bad news is , this is the most time - consuming way to skirt proper backups , both in terms of setup and recovery .
The good news is , you 're probably already doing this , to an extent .

If my laptop died right now , I 'd lose my settings , a little bit of music , a few day 's worth of documents , and well , that 's about it .
That 's because so , so much of my data lives in various online services , just by nature of how I work .
Rather than undertaking a day - long effort to upload all your files to myriad websites , just consider changing your habits a little , and easing into a cloud over time .
That these services provide useful backups is incidental — usually they 're intended as web apps — but that does n't mean they do n't serve the purpose beautifully .
Use them for their intended purposes - be it document editing , photo sharing , or music streaming — and you 'll soon realize that , without even trying , you 've create a wonderful , distributed backup of your most - used media across the internet .
Documents :
Advertisement
Google Docs :
This one 's a no- brainer , since a lot of you probably already use Gmail , with which Docs is tightly integrated .
It can sometimes break formatting in files , but at least you wo n't lose important data .
Office Live : Microsoft 's take on the online office suite comes with a free 5GB , which , let 's be honest , is an awful lot of Word documents .
Advertisement
Zoho :
As an online office suite , Zoho offers a few little features that Google and Microsoft do n't .
As a storage service , though , they only offer 1GB .
Still !
Photos :

Flickr :
The obvious choice for photography geeks , Flickr give you unlimited storage for free , at a rate of 100 MB a month .
Snapfish : With fewer options for enthusiasts , Snapfish 's draw is its unlimited storage and orderable photo prints .
Advertisement
Picasa : 1GB of Google 's storage space for free out of the box , with a nice client to boot .
Photobucket : Another 1GB of free storage , but this one takes video as well .
Facebook :
This might seem like an unlikely recommendation , but they 've got one of the best deals going , in a way .
If you 're not concerned about the quality of your photo uploads — like , you just want them for onscreen viewing — you can upload unlimited photos here , 200 at a time .
And in any case , a medium - quality JPEG is better than no photo at all .

Music :

MP3 Tunes :
Puts your music library everywhere , with a bevy of client apps for various platforms , including the iPhone .
2GB of free storage is n't much , but it 's something .
File Factory : Mentioned above in the general storage section , FileFactory also has a web interface for music .
100 GB is quite possibly enough to store your whole library .
Advertisement
Deezer : A French music streaming service that also lets you upload as much music as you 'd like , for personal use .
Video :
This is the most hackish of the bunch , but YouTube , Vimeo , Viddler and the like usually support private or invite - only videos , which means they can act as last resort backup solutions , though the loss of quality and long upload times might make these plans a little unwieldy .
