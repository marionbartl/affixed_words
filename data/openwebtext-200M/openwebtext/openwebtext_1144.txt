Rampage was working the corner for Abe Wagner in last night ’s premiere of “ The Ultimate Fighter ” .
Rampage did n’t offer up a lot of technical corner advice to Wagner .
Actually he did n’t tell him anything that fans at home could n’t have told him .
Except that most fans were probably too busy laughing to yell out such gems as these :
“ Get up ! ” “ Time is short , man ! ” “ He keeps doing the same thing over and over ! ” “ Man , c’mon Abe . ” “ Keep goin ’ . ”
“ Do what you gotta do , Abe .
Do what you gotta do . ”
“ Sweep or get up , man . ” “ Why you tryin ’ to shake hands with him , man !
Get up . ”
“ You gotta do somethin ’ . ”
“ Abe , you wanna win ?
You gotta go . ”
Not exactly instructive .
And Kimbo seemed happy to be with Rampage , but he ’d probably be much better off with Greg Jackson and Rashad .
Tune in again next week for Rampage ’s next top10 !
When different industries work together some call it " synergy . "
Consumers often refer to the practice in more obscene terms .
Companies from different markets — or that themselves span multiple markets — can make more money in some instances by tying their offerings together , so that in order to use one , you also have to use the other .
Although the approach is not without the occasional advantage for the consumer ( cable companies say their practice of bundling stations encourages niche programming , for instance ) , consumers mostly chafe when their choice of a certain product or service restricts their choice in another area .
The latest edition of Wired.com 's Five Things We 'd Like to Throw Down a Black Hole series lists five examples of industry collusion that are ripe for some deep - space deep - sixing .
5. Food and inescapable locations
Oh , how the vendors in venues that cannot be easily exited and reentered love charging an arm and a leg for nourishment .
But on the consumer side , there 's nothing quite like paying steep admission fees at amusement parks , sporting events , movie theaters , music venues , ski resorts , airports and the like , only to pay five dollars for a bottle of filtered tap water , $ 12 for a hot dog , or $ 52 - plus - tip for four cocktails , as the author recently did on an outing to the U.S. Open .
You 're trapped — they know it , you know it , and there 's nothing you can do .
Bonus points for not allowing outside food or drink into the venue .
4. 'Triple play ' packages for internet , phone and television
If your company owns technology for delivering television or telephone service , the internet represents a horrible monster set on destroying your market with its capacity to deliver all kinds of media over a single pipe .
That 's why , if you 're smart , you bundle these offerings into packages that seem to offer lower costs , but in fact bind consumers to expensive habits — hopefully , for years to come , from these companies ' perspective .
If you 're paying for phone and television along with your internet , you 're almost certainly less likely to switch to mobile or voice - over - IP for your phone and streaming and downloading networks for your video .
3 . Ticket sellers and various parties
Ticketmaster , the ticketing company known for tacking those much - hated " convenience " fees onto each purchase , is somewhat misunderstood .
Due to its lengthy and entangling history with venues , promoters , and — although they 'd never admit it — performing artists , Ticketmaster continues to implement these fees in part because it needs to keep so many stakeholders happy .
The losers : audience members who get repeatedly squeezed on tickets , T - shirts , parking , food , and drinks , but especially those pricey service charges ( no wonder they 're no longer paying for recorded music — who can afford it , when there 's next year 's show to save up for ? ) .
We hate those fees as much as anyone , because you should n't have to pay more for doing the work of a cashier than you would to drive to the venue and buy a ticket there .
The only way to get rid of this mess would be to throw it down a black hole .
2. ISPs and content providers
One of the oddest trends in media these days is for content providers to charge ISPs for content , who then offer it to the consumer as part of their monthly subscription .
One early example of this cable - television - like approach is ESPN 360 , which cannot be had for love or money .
The only way to get it is if your ISP ponies up large payments that cover all of its subscribers .
With so few companies employing the model to date , we 've been largely shielded from its big downside — namely , what happens if one service you want is on one ISP , while only a competing ISP offers another service you want ?
For example , the online music service Spotify , set to launch in the US , says it is considering licensing at the ISP level .
It 's conceivable that you will have to pay two ISPs if you want both ESPN 360 and Spotify .
1. Cellphone carriers and cellphone manufacturers
Most people know that the only reason you do n't pay the true cost of your cellphone hardware is that you have to sign a lengthy contract with a cellphone provider — a situation that is exacerbated by exclusive hardware contracts such as the one Apple signed with AT&T for the iPhone .
If you want to use this particular piece of hardware , you have to use its exclusive partner or unlock your phone , voiding its warranty and risking having it " bricked " from afar as punishment for allowing the device to operate outside of its original network .
Cooperation between cellphone manufacturers and service providers is nice , in that it lowers the initial cost of phones , but it has led to an inefficient market that discourages consumer choice , unless you count the option to switch networks and throw out your hardware every year or two .
And this is n't just about cellphones — the same is happening with netbooks .
The relationship between carrier and manufacturer even extends to which apps your phone is permitted to run ( see Google Voice and SlingPlayer ) .
Any others ?

The Daily Show is an intellectual respite from the self - aggrandizing sensationalism of traditional news sources , and as such , one ca n’t help but cringe a little at the idea that it , too , may have begun to take itself a bit too seriously .
Rachel Maddow and Kent Jones do a hokie , but apt parody of what dealing with the Republicans on health care amounts to .
Kent Jones really does n't want to order pizza , and the Republicans really do n't want any sort of health care reform .
Maddow : Republicans in the United States ' Senate are Kent .
And we 're trying to order pizza .
They do say that they want health care reform .
[....]
Because Republicans have said that they want health care reform , Democrats have been trying to work with them to come up with a bill that both sides can agree on .
We can compromise .
Democrats took national health care and single payer off the table from the very beginning because they were sure that Republicans would n't want those .
Then they started negotiating down from there , trying to find something , anything that the Republican would say yes to .
But just as national health care was unacceptable to them , and single payer was unacceptable to them , the public option is also turning out to be unacceptable to them .
And now even the further watered down reform option of co-ops are unacceptable to them .
[....]
That 's a really important moment .
Senator Grassley is the top Republican negotiator in the Senate on health care and he just admitted to Chuck Todd that even if he personally gets to draft a bill for the Senate to vote on , even if he ends up with a policy to vote on that he thinks is great , he himself might not vote for it .
Mean while Jon Kyl , the number two Republican in the whole Senate told reporters on a conference call today that dropping the public option still wo n't get any Republicans to vote for the bill .
No matter what is in the bill , Republicans are not going to vote for the bill .
No matter what is on the pizza , Kent does n't want it .
Maybe it 's time for Democrats to take the hint .
Republicans do n't want pizza .
Order exactly what you want .
Put together the best possible reform bill purely on the basis of what you think the best policy for the country is , and then , forget the Republicans .
Focus on getting all the Democrats in line to vote for it .
The Republicans are not here to help .
And Kent is not here to make a good pizza order .
Take the hint .
Broadway and Flint .

A woman was handcuffed and placed under arrest this morning after she was stopped for running the stop sign at NE Flint and Broadway when she asked the police officer if she was required to show identification .
She was subsequently issued a citation and released .
Jessica Jarratt , 37 , the executive director of an arts funding nonprofit , was commuting from her Northeast Portland home to her office in the Pearl this morning around 9:00 am .
In a phone interview this afternoon , she described being stopped by a police officer at Flint and Broadway , along with several other people on bikes , after she had turned right onto Broadway from Flint without coming to a complete stop .
She was pulled over by Officer Felts , who immediately asked her for her driver ’s license .
“ I said , wait , can you tell me why you ’re stopping me ? ”
The officer responded that she had run a stop sign and requested her identification again .
Jarratt said that she asked , “ Do I legally have to carry it ? ” and that Felts simply repeated the request .
Frustrated , she asked if she could call a lawyer friend to ask about her rights in the situation .
“ I just did n’t know , ” she explained .
“ And the officer just did n’t engage at all . ”
Officer Felts then , she reported , said “ That ’s it , you ’re under arrest . ”
She says that he “ took out his handcuffs and put them on my hands in such a violent way that I still have raised red marks . ”
He ushered her to the sidewalk and called for backup .
Another officer walked over to her and she asked him to loosen the handcuffs — “ I was really in pain . ”
He complied .
This Google Street View is looking north from Broadway at N. Flint and N Wheeler is off to the left .
Felts came back over to her and said “ This is your last chance , will you give me your name ? ”
She gave her name , age , and address .
He looked her up in his computer , removed the handcuffs , and let her go free with a $ 242 citation for failure to obey a traffic control device .
Jarratt said that throughout the incident , “ I was very calm , I did n’t cuss , I did n’t say anything I would be embarrassed to have said .
I was clearly not a physical threat to this guy .
He could have just explained .
If he had said , ‘ Yes you ’re legally required to have an ID , ’ I would have shown him one . ”
“ I want to be totally clear in my story that I did break a law , and I ’m willing to pay the fine associated with that , ” she said .
“ My beef is the way that he treated me in the process and his overall approach .
I ’m definitely going to pay the ticket , and I already filed a complaint , and I also want to do everything I can to send out a message that the Portland police can’t treat people this way . ”
You are not required by law to produce or carry identification if you are n’t driving a motor vehicle , local bike lawyer Mark Ginsberg told us , adding that you do not need a drivers license or any other form of identification to operate a bicycle , “ or to walk down the street for that matter . ”
But if a police officer asks for your name , you have to give it .
“ I want to be totally clear in my story that I did break a law , and I ’m willing to pay the fine associated with that .
My beef is the way that he treated me in the process and his overall approach . ”
If you do not identify yourself , or if you give a name that the officer suspects to be false , they can legally hold you in custody until they determine your identity .
That ’s probably what happened here , Ginsberg said .
This is different from being under arrest , which would require an officer to read you your rights and allow you access to an attorney .
“ If they told her she was under arrest and then let her go , well that ’s bad practice . ”
When we spoke this afternoon , Jarratt was clearly still shaken by the incident .
She said the intimidation she experienced was not called for , especially since people on bikes are not , like motor vehicle operators , required to carry an ID card , and may not have been pulled over before or know what to expect from a traffic stop .
“ I think the whole bureau needs to realize that — especially if they ’re going to be going after pedestrians , bicyclists , people who are in a more vulnerable physical situation than in a car . ”
Portland Police have held several series of enforcement actions at NE Flint and Broadway in the last year in response to safety concerns .
Back in 2007 , the city ’s water bureau banned its own vehicles from using Wheeler , the street just to the west of Flint , because of concerns about collisions involving bicycles .
New pavement markings have been installed along with other safety features .

なぜNoopという新言語を開発したのか？ 「 Why Noop？ 」 という項目を、少し長いのですが引用してみましょう。
Dependency Injection changed the way we write software .
Spring overtook EJB's in thoughtful enterprises , and Guice and PicoContainer are an important part of well - written applications today .
DI はソフトウェアの開発を変えてしまいました。SpringはEJBを乗り越えてしまいましたし、またGuiceとPicoContainerは良質なアプリケーションの重要な部品となっています。
Automated testing , especially Unit Testing , is also a crucial part of building reliable software that you can feel confident about supporting and changing over its lifetime .
Any decent software shop should be writing some tests , the best ones are test - driven and have good code coverage .
自動テスティング、とりわけユニットテスティングは信頼性の高いソフトウェアのために欠かせないものとなっています。これがあることで、いつでもプログラマは動作に自信を持ち、また安全にコードを変更できるのです。あらゆるまともなソフトウェア部隊はテストを書くべきですし、もっともよいのはコード全体をテストドリブンなやりかたで書くことです。
Noop is a new language that runs on the Java Virtual Machine , and in source form looks similar to Java .
The goal is to build dependency injection and testability into the language from the beginning , rather than rely on third - party libraries as all other languages do .
Noop はJavaVMで動作する新しいプログラミング言語で、Java言語に似ています。目指すゴールは、サードパーティなどのライブラリに頼らず、最初から言語にDIとテスタビリティを組み込んでおくことです、
Noopの公開をいちはやく報じたeWEEKの記事「 Google Delivers New Java - like Language : Noop」によると、JVM
Language Summitの会場では早くもNoopが話題になっているそうです。

Federal Communications Commission Chairman Julius Genachowski will deliver a speech on Monday that sources say will outline a plan to adopt new net neutrality rules .
According to a report published by Reuters , the FCC chairman 's plan will seek the adoption of new rules intended to ensure that ISPs can't arbitrarily block or slow down their customers ' access based on content .
The concept of net neutrality maintains that ISPs , including both broadband cable and DSL providers as well as wireless mobile companies , must deliver data to their customers irrespective of its source , destination , ownership , or the protocol used to deliver it .
Currently , many ISPs block or filter customers who use P2P applications .
Advocates of net neutrality argue that without regulation , ISPs may eventually seek to sell artificially limited access to specific sites or discriminate against competitors by offering access priority to their own services while slowing access to competitive offerings .
Without net neutrality rules , ISPs have the incentive to create monopolies of content and services , or to sell tiers of services where users must pay extra for full access to the Internet , a concept illustrated in a spoof advertisement circling the web ( below ) .
Net neutrality and the FCC
The FCC issued a policy statement in 2005 that outlined four non-binding " policy principles " on open Internet access , stating that consumers are entitled to open competition , access to any lawful content , the ability to run any applications or services , and the use of any legal devices on their network that do not harm the network .
Last year , Google asked the FCC to require that operators bidding in the 700 MHz spectrum auction agree to open their networks to any application , any devices , any services , and any networks .
The FCC agreed to support open devices and open applications , but not the latter two .
Last August , the FCC voted to uphold a complaint filed against Comcast which had ruled the cable provider had illegally blocked its Internet subscribers from using BitTorrent file sharing software .
Comcast challenged the ruling in court , saying the FCC does not have the authority to regulate its actions on the Internet .
Monday marks the deadline set by the court for the FCC to respond to the challenge .
The FCC is expected to argue that the agency has broad authority to regulate ISPs under the 1996 Telecommunications Act .
Debate on net neutrality
Net neutrality became a minor issue in the 2008 US presidential election , with Barack Obama officially supporting the policy of net neutrality , and John McCain saying that big network operators should have the right to limit their customers ' options if they could profit from doing so .
" When you control the pipe you should be able to get profit from your investment , " McCain told Google CEO Eric Schmidt in a campaign interview .
Genachowski served as President Obama 's technology advisor during the campaign before being appointed as FCC chairman this summer .
The Obama administration also added openness requirements to the $ 7.2 billion in broadband infrastructure investments included in its Recovery Act stimulus bill .
Opposition to the principle of net neutrality is commonly voiced by cable and telecom companies , right wing think tanks such as the Cato Institute , and astroturf advocacy groups such as " Hands off the Internet , " a site financed by AT&T and " Citizens Against Government Waste , " a nonprofit group linked to Jack Abramoff .
CAGW previously made headlines after it mailed form letters supporting Microsoft in its antitrust lawsuit , addressed from concerned citizens who turned out to be dead people .
Apple and net neutrality
While Apple generally benefits from the principle of net neutrality , its partnership with AT&T has resulted in at least two issues that concern the principle .
The first is Apple 's rejection of the Google Voice app on the iPhone .
The FCC has been investigating the incident to determine if Apple 's decision is effectively being made by AT&T to restrict potential competition in wireless services .
The FCC lacks the jurisdiction to determine what apps Apple must sell in its App Store , and Apple maintains that it has yet to even determine if it will approve some form of the Google Voice app .
Additionally , it is possible for Google to deliver a web - based version of the app on the iPhone without Apple 's approval , clouding the issue of whether the dispute is actually an issue of net neutrality at all .
Apple does ban VoIP applications from using the iPhone 's mobile network , a policy that is clearly related to carrier demands and may likely be affected by new net neutrality rules .
The other issue that the FCC is investigating concerns exclusive sales of phones on specific providers .
Apple 's exclusive deal with AT&T has brought that issue to the forefront , both for users who want to use the iPhone on other providers , and for small regional providers who lack the clout to make similar deals .
Technology constraints also factor into the matter , as the existing iPhone simply can't work on the CDMA networks run by the Verizon and Sprint , the providers most affected users would like to be able to use it on .
That may change in the next several years as Verizon and AT&T both build out compatible new LTE networks .
Last year , only 5 % of Garfield students tested as proficient in any math class .
The school qualified for possible takeover as one of more than 250 that had consistently failed to meet federal benchmarks and thus was designated as falling into “ Program Improvement ” status .
The board resolution applied to any school with that designation for three or more years .
Garfield High , which for decades has served a largely immigrant population east of downtown , reached its recent high - water mark in the 1980s , when math teacher Jaime Escalante built a famed calculus program that became the subject of a book and subsequent movie .
Under his leadership , dozens of students passed the Advanced Placement calculus test every year , a rare feat even at the nation ’s elite high schools .
Sources supplied the information on a confidential basis because they did not have permission to disclose it .
In an interview Thursday , district Supt. Ramon C. Cortines said he would release the list today , but only after notifying senior officials of the Los Angeles Unified School District .
Garfield ’s selection means that the nation ’s second - largest school system will invite bidders — from inside and outside of the district — to run the East Los Angeles campus of 4,600 students .
This “ request - for - proposal ” process could apply to more than 250 schools under a Board of Education resolution passed last month , but the initial set of schools will number 12 , sources said .
Garfield High , which became nationally known as the real - life setting for the film “ Stand and Deliver , ” will be among the first group of local schools eligible for takeover because of persistent academic failure , a high - level district source has told The Times .
Cortines later refined the criteria .
“ Focus ” schools , as he called them , would have to meet additional criteria : Less than 21 % of students proficient in math or English and schoolwide improvement of less than 10 points on the state ’s Academic Performance Index , which is largely based on standardized test scores .
In addition , high schools would have a dropout rate greater than 10 % .
Garfield qualified easily .
Moreover , the school has the lowest rank , 1 of 10 , when compared with schools statewide .
But that does not make Garfield ’s selection noncontroversial or uncontestable .
When compared with schools that serve similar students , Garfield rates a 6 of 10 , which puts it in the upper half of state schools by that yardstick .
An independently operated charter school , for example , would be eligible for renewal if it achieved a 4 of 10 in this category .
Charter schools are exempt from some rules governing traditional schools , including adherence to the district ’s union contracts .
And although Garfield dropped three points on this year ’s Academic Performance Index , it had improved by 44 and 25 points the previous two years .
That gives the school a three - year average gain of 22 points annually , far surpassing the level of improvement that Cortines sought for just one year .
“ It ’s hard to have constant progress each year , ” said social studies teacher Brian Fritch .
“ We ’re doing our best .
People here really care about their jobs and they ’re trying to do well . ”
These efforts have included a recent intervention program that includes Saturday school and after - school tutoring and faculty collaboration that entails reviewing data to refine teaching strategies , Fritch said .
The expectation that Garfield would be put up for bidding has affected the campus climate , Fritch said .
“ The mood is not good , ” he said .
“ There is a lot of fear , uncertainty and anger .
We have a lot of teachers confused about what the next step will be .
People do n’t feel included in the process and feel rushed .
Even students talk about it . ”
Garfield has been a particular reform battleground in recent weeks .
The school has been targeted by The Parents Revolution , a group initiated within the charter - school organization Green Dot Public Schools .
Its organizers assert they have signatures from community parents equal in number to more than half the Garfield student body .
They say that the district must either improve Garfield or face competition from startup charter schools that would surround the Garfield campus .
The district ’s action , in opening Garfield to bidding , means a charter school can now vie to manage Garfield .
The school board 's school - control resolution , authored by Yolie Flore Aguilar , also applies to 51 new schools set to open over the next four years .
Another organization involved at Garfield has been the local nonprofit InnerCity Struggle .
It has pushed the “ pilot school ” model , under which Garfield would be divided into separate , independent small schools that , unlike charters , would retain a close affiliation with the school district .
InnerCity Struggle has especially close ties with school board President Monica Garcia .
On campus , Fritch is trying to organize an internal reform proposal .
He was among a delegation of about 20 Garfield teachers Thursday who toured pilot schools already operating within L.A. Unified

The Dutch are taking a novel approach to health care , and it has nothing to do with providing herbal remedies in Amsterdam 's coffee shops .
Starting in 2006 , the Netherlands has required all adults to buy their own health insurance , or pay a penalty .
And insurers must offer policy to all comers , no matter how sick or old they are , WSJ's Gautam Naik reports .
The government subsidizes policies for adults who can't afford to pay premiums and makes " risk- equalization " payments to insurers that cover the elderly and those with some chronic conditions such as diabetes .
The current Dutch program differs from plans in other parts of Europe , which mostly offer national health care , and the U.S. , which largely relies on employers paying for the bulk of coverage .
The idea behind the Dutch is that individuals will enroll in health plans that provide the coverage they need instead of a one - size - fits - all plan chosen by an employer .
And individuals will pay more attention to health costs , which are largely ignored when the government picks up the tab .
The Dutch want the " risk- equalization " incentive payments to motivate insurers to cover more than just healthy customers .

so is this a token bust or a step in the right direction ?
i would love to see carol lam tapped as special prosecutor http://thinkprogress.org...9/carol-lam-white-house/ from the article
The media reports this morning that among Lam ’s politically powerful targets were former CIA official Kyle “ Dusty ” Foggo and then - House Appropriations Committee Chairman Jerry Lewis ( R - CA ) .
But there is evidence to believe that the White House may also have been on Lam ’s target list .
Here are the connections : – Washington D.C. defense contractor Mitchell Wade pled guilty last February to paying then - California Rep. Randy “ Duke ” Cunningham more than $ 1 million in bribes .
– Wade ’s company MZM Inc. received its first federal contract from the White House .
The contract , which ran from July 15 to August 15 , 2002 , stipulated that Wade be paid $ 140,000 to “ provide office furniture and computers for Vice President Dick Cheney . ” –
Two weeks later , on August 30 , 2002 , Wade purchased a yacht for $ 140,000 for Duke Cunningham .
The boat ’s name was later changed to the “ Duke - Stir . ”
Said one party to the sale : “ I knew then that somebody was going to go to jail for that …Duke looked at the boat , and Wade bought it — all in one day .
Then they got on the boat and floated away . ”
– According to Cunningham ’s sentencing memorandum , the purchase price of the boat had been negotiated through a third - party earlier that summer , around the same time the White House contract was signed .
T recap , the White House awarded a one - month , $ 140,000 contract to an individual who never held a federal contract .
Two weeks after he got paid , that same contractor used a cashier ’s check for exactly that amount to buy a boat for a now - imprisoned congressman at a price that the congressman had pre-negotiated .

If someone objects to the racist , apartheid policies of the Jewish State , they are labeled " anti-semitic " .
If someone notices and mentions discrepancies in the official Holocaust ™ story , such as how the sacred " 6 million " number has n't changed , despite the reduction in Auschwitz official numbers from 4 million to 1 - 1.5 million , they are labeled " anti-semitic " .
If someone notices that our supposed friends in the Jewish State are heavily involved in espionage against us and sell our military secrets to China , they are labeled " anti-semitic " .
So , tell me , what 's so wrong with being labeled " anti-semitic " ?
Sounds like it is a badge of honor in recognition of one 's morality and ability to see the obvious .

What I find interesting re Edmonds narrative is corroboration with other information about 911 and the NeoCons .
There were evidently cells within the U S , British , Israeli and other governments in collusion , having the same effect of overruling their intelligence agencies to get their goals accomplished .
It looks as though we had U S , British , Israeli and other agents trying to prevent 911 and the war against Iraq , and agents in these same agencies working to enable them .

Karen , Unfortunately , Carol Lam was rather QUICKLY hired on as Qualcomm 's Senior Vice President and Legal Counsel right after she left her prosecutor position when she indicted Dusty Foggo and Brent Wilkes .
Done right about the time when a few Dems were looking at the idea of hiring her back as an independent contractor to follow up on the prosecutions she was working on .
Perhaps coincidentally , or perhaps not so coincidentally , Brent Scowcroft , serves on the board of Qualcomm , as well as the board of the American Turkish Council ( ATC ) .
Probably would be difficult to hire her away from that position .

IcebergSlim ,
When you and treetop say that Ban - Ami Kadish is a ' Jew traitor ' , you are implying that he 's traitor to the " Jew " religion , which if you want to be more accurate and not slurring it , you would refer to him as a ' JewISH traitor ' , if you wanted to make him out to be a traitor to his JewISH religion .
But no , you are saying that he is a " Jew betraying his country " .
WHICH country , the U.S. , or Israel ?
THOSE are countries .
There is no country named " Jew " .
Therefore one can only conclude that " Jew " as you and Treetop use it is an ADDITIONAL adjective besides Kadish 's country used to denigrate him as a slur on his religion .
Now he might be an AMERICAN traitor , which I do n't think Brad would have necessarily taken issue with , if you have an honest reason to feel that he 's betrayed America , which many here , perhaps including myself might feel .
But there 's no reason to use religious slurs when none are necessary .
It just gives those who are trying to have honest criticism of these foreign country lobbies and those that are abusing their power in our government with them a bad name .
You do n't call other traitors here like Bush a " Christ - lover " traitor do you ?
He might be a traitor too , which I feel there 's a good argument for saying , but I would n't use that terminology if I wanted to get others to hear what I am saying for the RIGHT reasons , and not for other reasons that appeals to other emotions instead of logic .

I found some interesting stuff behind Nozette having worked for the Israeli government owned Israel Aerospace Industries for a decade and a possible sale of satellites to Turkey currently being held up by the US government .
It may or may not be relevant but I am kicking it in here anyways .

Around half of all attendees to a YAPC have never attended a YAPC before .
As of today , 7680 people have uploaded a distribution to the CPAN .
Several hundred people -- over a thousand -- have credits in the source code to Perl 5 .
In any given yearly period , a few dozen people have contributed more than a single patch to Perl 5 , Rakudo , or Parrot .
PerlMonks has a couple of hundred very active users .
It takes months of effort to get a dozen potential students for each year 's Google Summer of Code for Perl .
A new edition of the book Programming Perl may sell hundreds of thousands of copies .
A new edition of Learning Perl may sell tens of thousands of copies .
A controversial or active Perl blog most may get a dozen comments .
There may be a million people in the world who 've wrote more than one line of Perl code for some purpose .
Go find a novice , encourage him or her to continue learning Perl , and -- most importantly -- introduce him or her to the community .
You do n't have to file a bug on rt.perl.org or rt.cpan.org or fix the XS documentation in the Perl 5 core or help bootstrap the Parrot JIT or organize a conference or volunteer to mentor a TPF grant .
Yet you 'll get much , much more out of Perl if you add your little bit to the wider Perl community .
If we are to improve our community to welcome more participants ( and we should do that ) , we should also actively recruit new participants .
Do n't wait for them to come to us .
Let 's go find them and invite them and make them feel welcome that way , too .
In the latest phase of its battle with Intel for the notebook and netbook markets , ARM has unveiled two new 2GHz capable Cortex - A9 dual core processor implementation .
These give silicon manufacturers a way to develop high - performance , low - power Cortex - A9 processor - based devices , ARM said .
However , it looks like this battle will only take place in the Linux corner of the market .
Microsoft has said Windows 7 wo n’t run on these processors .
The New ARM Processors
The most important thing about the announcement is that it was not about finished processors — ARM announced two Cortex - A9 MPCore hard macro implementations for the TSMC 40 nm - G process .
The Cortex - A9 speed - optimized hard macro implementation will provide system designers with an ARM processor incorporating low - power techniques .
They can then target high - margin consumer and enterprise devices within the power envelope necessary for compact , thermally constrained environments , ARM said .
In other words , the chips made from these are for small devices that cannot run too hot and can be sold at high prices .
ARM is perhaps thinking of devices like set - top boxes and printers .
“ There ’s a lot more work to do on the architecture before it ’s ready for general purpose processing , ” Martin Reynolds , a Gartner distinguished analyst , told LinuxInsider .
Cranking Things Up a Notch
Here ’s the problem with the macro implementations :
They may be rated at 2GHz , but they may not deliver that speed .
“ These are just the 800 MHz ARM cores running two and a half times faster , ” Reynolds said .
“ If you just make the clock speed run faster , instead of doing more work , it spends more time doing nothing . ”
Diagram of the ARM Cortex - A9 MPCore ( click image to enlarge )
While each core runs at 1 GHz , meaning it executes 1 billion instructions per second , the DRAM can only process about 20 million transactions per second , Reynolds explained .
[* Correction – Sept. 18 , 2009 ]
“ You have to close the gap between the speed at which the processor processes things and the speed at which the DRAM delivers them , ” he said .
“ If you double the processor rate but the DRAM delivers data at the same rate it did , you only get half the work done . ”
No Window of Opportunity With Win 7
To get around the DRAM bottleneck , Intel and AMD use large caches and have very clever algorithms to figure out how to tell the DRAM in advance what the processor needs , Reynolds said .
“ That ’s where all the magic is in building new Atom processors , and that ’s why they run Windows so well , ” he explained .
“ Windows is a random app , and you never know what it ’s going to do next . ”
These architectural differences between ARM processors and those from Intel and AMD make it difficult for Windows to run on the ARM chips .
“ You have to do a lot of work to move Windows onto the ARM chip , ” Reynolds said .
“ ARM is a very powerful processor designed for small size and low power consumption , but it ca n’t do big things . ”
That might see ARM chips restricted to smartphones and netbooks running Linux .
Still , several netbook manufacturers have announced ARM - based netbooks .
They include HP , Asus , Sharp , Pegatron , Jointech , Foxconn and Nokia .
Netbooks running Android could also be based on these chips , for which Google has expressed support .
“ Open source software like Android and Symbian will run well on these chips , ” Reynolds said .

Renault sponsors walk
At the end of this month , Divmod will lay off its last employee and cease to be .
As some of you know , I 've been on hiatus for several months now .
The idea was originally that I would take a break , allow the company to build up a small operating buffer to deal with our cash - flow issues , and heal a psyche damaged by many months of intense stress ( caused largely by those same cash - flow issues ) .
The psyche - healing worked out okay .
I 'm feeling much better than I was when my break started .
The cash - flow issues , not so much .
The reality turned out to be that much of the new consulting business we were counting on just did n't materialize .
We managed to get quite a bit of maintenance done on our infrastructure — I continued to help out intermittently , interleaving some reviews and bugfixes with hobby projects — but it was no longer really clear what business purpose that infrastructure was serving .
We did n't have any product that generated a revenue stream and we certainly did n't have the resources to build a new one .
Users of Divmod email : I 'm not exactly sure what the plan is , but JP and I will personally make sure that you can get your email in some form and we 'll work out some way to keep at least a forwarding service running .
Users of Divmod open source projects : we will figure out some way to continue to host and maintain the code .
I 'm not sure what we 're going to do about official stewardship , but it was years before Twisted needed any official legal structure , so I 'm sure we 'll make due .
The Divmod Fan Club , which deposits money into mypaypal account rather than a business one ( for stupid technical reasons which are now extremely convenient ) , is generating enough money that we may be able to afford some hosting , assuming those of you who supported Divmod - the - company would like to continue supporting Divmod - the - ambiguously - defined - collection - of - open - source - projects .
Regardless of whether you decide to cancel your subscriptions now ( you can do so in the UI for your PayPal account ; nothing to do with us , happily ) , thank you all , very much .
You enabled us to do a lot more with our open - source work than we would otherwise have been able to , and you helped the get through a number of crunches in the past .
The fan clubenable us to host the collection of open source projects , and possibly also host versions of Mantissa and Quotient , and Sine .
I think that having some users would help keep those projects alive in the absence of a corporate sponsor .
I 'm not really sure what 's going to happen to Blendix , though , and as a proprietary thing it requires more thinking .
If you care deeply about it , please get in touch with me .
Also , if you are a member of the Divmod community who might like to help out with administration , we might need help with mundane things like keeping our Trac instance running .
Now , on to the more personal stuff .
Thanks in advance for your condolances , but I 'm feeling okay about this .
Not to say that I do n't wish Divmod had ended with more success , but I spoke to Amir and JP yesterday , and we all agreed — it 's time to move on .
We tried everything we could think of .
It 's time to do something different .
More importantly , I 'm not really sure what I 'm going to do next .
Right now I 'm considering a few things .
I have a couple of job offers , I have a few ideas for new businesses that I might want to start myself .
Some of those ideas are things I would bootstrap myself , some would require funding .
Some of you reading this right now have intimated that you 'd like to offer me a job , if I were available .
Some have speculated that you might want to fund some other company that was less ambitious than Divmod .
Well , now 's your chance .
Get in touch , and let 's talk .
If you can , please do it soon , though .
Some of the offers I 'm already considering need a decision soon , but I 'd really like an opportunity to consider my options before I jump into the next thing .

Electric cars will not be dramatically cleaner than autos powered by fossil fuels until they rely less on electricity produced from conventional coal - fired power plants , scientists said on Monday .
For electric vehicles to become a major green alternative , the power fuel mix has to move away from coal , or cleaner coal technologies have to be developed , said Jared Cohon , the chair of a National Research Council report released on Monday called Hidden Costs of Energy : Unpriced Consequences of Energy Production and Use .
About half of U.S. power is generated by burning coal , which emits many times more of traditional pollutants , such as particulates and smog components , than natural gas , and about twice as much of the main greenhouse gas carbon dioxide .
Nuclear and renewable power would have to generate a larger portion of U.S. power for electric cars to become much greener compared to gasoline - powered cars , Cohan , who is also president of Carnegie Mellon University , said in an interview .
Advances in coal burning , like capturing carbon at power plants for permanent burial underground , could also help electric cars become a cleaner alternative to vehicles powered by fossil fuels , he said .
Pollution from energy sources did $ 120 billion worth of damage to human health , agriculture and recreation in 2005 , said the NRC report , which was requested by the U.S. Congress in 2005 and sponsored by the U.S. Department of the Treasury .
Electricity was responsible for more than half of the damage , the report said .
Electric cars have other benefits such as reducing imports of foreign oil .
But they can also have hidden costs
Materials in electric car batteries are hard to produce , which adds to the energy it takes to make them .
In fact , the health and environmental costs of making electric cars can be 20 percent greater than conventional cars , and manufacturing efficiencies will have to be achieved in order for the cars to become greener , the report said .
Emissions from operating and building electric cars in 2005 cost about 0.20 cents to 15 cents per vehicle mile traveled , it said .
In comparison , gasoline - powered cars cost about 0.34 cents to 5.04 cents per vehicle mile traveled .
The report estimated that electric cars could still cost more than gasoline - powered cars to operate and manufacture in 2030 unless U.S. power production becomes cleaner .
Hybrid gasoline - electric vehicles with batteries that are charged by the driver hitting the brakes scored slightly better than both gasoline - powered cars and plug - in hybrid cars , which have batteries that are charged by the power grid .

Hubble is expected to keep working until at least 2014
Astronomers are celebrating the release of remarkable new images from the Hubble Space Telescope ( HST ) .
They prove the mission carried out by astronauts in May to service the observatory was an outstanding success .
The latest pictures include trademark Hubble visions - from colliding galaxies to dying stars .
Nasa says the orbiting telescope , regarded as one of the most important scientific tools ever built , should keep working until at least 2014 .
The Atlantis shuttle mission in May was the fifth and final Hubble makeover .
The Butterfly Nebula captured with the new WFC3
Look in close - up at the new pictures
The US space agency and its international partners plan now to concentrate their efforts on preparing a bigger and more capable observatory known as the James Webb Space Telescope ( JWST ) .
Wednesday 's release of pictures was the usual tour de force that astronomers have come to expect following a Hubble servicing .
It included dazzling pictures of galaxies headed for a pile - up , a star throwing off its outer layers , dense clouds of gas and dust , and a new pin-sharp look at the planet Jupiter .
" Hubble is back in action , " declared Dr Heidi Hammel , a senior research scientist at the Space Telescope Science Institute in Baltimore , Maryland , from where Hubble 's mission is overseen .
" Together , Nasa and Hubble are opening new vistas on the Universe , " she told a reporters .
The British astronomer Dr Paul Murdin , from the University of Cambridge , said the new images were breathtaking .
" My first reaction is ' my god , it all worked , it 's fantastic ' , " he told BBC News .
" Refurbishment missions are always a little bit iffy because things can go wrong ; astronauts can muck it up , maybe we did n't think about this or that when we redesigned the equipment , reinstalled it and refurbished it .
" But these images definitely show that Hubble is in good shape for what will be - unfortunately - its last few years .
" It 's going to go out with a real bang . "
The servicing mission went better than astronomers dared hope The Atlantis astronauts conducted five spacewalks , to install new instruments and thermal blankets , to repair two existing instruments , and replace the telescope 's gyroscopes and batteries .
Hubble is now more sensitive to light than ever before which should significantly improve its observing efficiency .
A key addition was the new Wide Field Camera 3 .
This is the instrument that many astronomers suspect will deliver the really big discoveries in the remaining operational years .
It will enable astronomers to carry out new studies of dark energy and dark matter , the " mysterious stuff " that makes up most of the Universe .
WFC3 will also allow Hubble to look deeper into space than ever before , to search for the very first stars to shine in the Universe more than 13 billion years ago .
One of the simpler tasks undertaken during the repair mission was to fit a docking ring that will serve as a point of contact with the defunct Hubble sometime after 2020 .
A robotic mission will be sent to push the telescope back towards Earth and a fiery destruction in the atmosphere .
" Most of us humans will never travel to some of the exotic places physically that we see in these images , " reflected Nasa 's chief scientist , Ed Weiler " What Hubble has done : it 's enabled our hearts , our minds , our spirits to travel throughout the Solar System , even billions of light - years to the very beginning of time almost .
And I think its ability to inspire at least some of our school kids to consider careers in engineering , science and math - that will be its most important legacy , not just keeping us astronomers happy . "
SOME KEY HUBBLE TELESCOPE DISCOVERIES TO DATE
In what was a prime mission objective , Hubble fixed the Universe 's age at about 13.7 billion years - later confirmed by other instruments Hubble 's ability to detect faint supernovae contributed to the discovery that the expansion rate of the Universe is accelerating Hubble was one of two telescopes to make the first direct images of planets orbiting another star - historic images made public last November Hubble provided the first direct measurements of the three - dimensional distribution of dark matter in space Hubble has shown that monster black holes , with masses millions to billions times the mass of our Sun , inhabit the centres of most galaxies

The Five Hottest Children 's Television Personalities
By Dustin Rowles | Lists | October 14 , 2009 |
My kid has been at home with pneumonia this week , hacking like a pack - a - day smoker , so in addition to having to do a lot of my writing for the site late at night or harried , during naps , I ’ve also become even more familiar with children ’s television .
Except when he ’s sick ( and if your kid goes to play school , he ’s always fucking sick ) , we do n’t expose him to much television aside from the occasional “ Sesame Street ” episode and “ Calliou ” ( and if you ’re not familiar with the latter , count your goddamn blessings : Calliou is a whiny little French - Canadian (? ) brat who spends most of his day pissing and moaning and begging to see his goddamn grandma , though God knows why she ’d want to spend any time with the insufferable twit , especially after he broke the mug she made him .
The little shit .
But whatevs . )
But when the kid is sick and unable to go outside , and I ’ve already exhausted every puzzle , Lego , and book in the house , I ’ll resort to a little children ’s television , though he usually shows a decided disinterest in most of them ( he ’s a pretentious little two - year - old , much to my pleasure ) .
I ’ve also spent a lot of time at the houses of friends who have children , so I ’m at least familiar with a lot of the shows , and a lot of the hosts ( also , slightly related : I do n’t really understand the appeal of “ Spongebob ” to toddlers — it ’s esoteric humor , a series of non-sequiturs that are only amusing in their nonsensicalness .
Granted , I often get a kick out of it , but do kids understand that ?
Or are all kids secretly smoking fatties ? )
Anyway , I figure :
Why not put that otherwise useless knowledge to use , and knowing our readers as I do , slapping a “ hottest ” in front of the SRL title means that a lot of you are going to click out of simple curiosity .
Cause you folks are sexual deviants always on the prowl for new objects of fantasy , God bless you .
So , why not .
Here are the five hottest children ’s television personalities .
5. DJ Lance Rock ( “ Yo Gabba Gabba ” ) : I actually went through a month - long phase last year where I was actually trying to will my son into liking this show , if only because I kind of dug it .
It ’s basically a kid ’s show for hipster kids — Mark Mothersbaugh ( Devo ) and The Aquabats are regulars , and they have a special guest on each episode ( the Elijah Wood ep went viral for a while ) .
It ’s part cool and part freaky Dee - Lite type kid ’s show , and the glue that holds it all together is DJ Lance Rock .
Lance Robertson was once a figure in the indie rock scene , but I reckon he eventually decided , “ If you ca n’t beat them , make a kid ’s show . ”
4. Wendy Calio ( “ Imagination Movers ” ) : Yeah .
I really do n’t know who this is .
Never seen the show .
But at a bar last night , I told a buddy I was putting this list together , and he suggested Calio , who is apparently a rising star over on Disney ( Disney characters are n’t allowed in our house , because … well … the line is too long at Space Mountain , and it ’s not even close to worth it ) .
Wendy plays Nina , a “ perky , always smiling , youthful lady that sometimes helps the ‘ movers ’ solve their problems .
Nina usually wears red and pink .
She usually is featured dancing along with the movers in their very catchy songs . ”
In other words , she rocks the stripper pole while The Imagination Movers melt kids faces with their mad licks .
Or something .
Of course , when I looked up Wendy Calio , one of the first things I found was this quote , on a message board : “ I would do nasty , filthy things with the chick from Imagination Movers .
Oh , and when finished , I would like to follow with more debaucherous mayhem with the chick from Choo Choo Soul . ”
And now I officially feel like a giant skeeze for even suggesting this list .
Here ’s Wendy :
3. Anthony Field ( “ The Wiggles ” ) : I do n’t watch this show .
I do n’t let my kid watch this show .
I once saw about 30 seconds of it , and whatever they were singing jangled around in my brain for the next seven months .
If I wanted horrible infectious songs stuck in my goddamn head all day , I ’d listen to the Black Eyed Peas .
But , I do understand that soccer moms like to pick out their favorite Wiggle and fantasize about him , and who am I to patronize their masturbation material ?
Apparently , Anthony ’s the Paul McCartney of the group .
Or the Lennon .
Whichever one was the cutest .
He was Cleo ’s bachelor of the year .
He ’s Australian .
And he breeds miniature fox terriers .
How ’s that for a catch , ladies ?
2. Steve Burns ( “ Blue ’s Clues ” ) : I ’m totally new to “ Blue ’s Clues , ” which is actually one of the most successful children ’s shows for preschoolers of all time .
It was put together after a lot of intensive study and research on early childhood education , and the show reflects that .
It invites a lot of involvement , and the early success of the show was largely attributed to its host , Steve Burns .
Burns is another indie rocker , as well as a professional actor who left the show in 2001 .
There ’s a new host now , and I ’ve only seen half an episode of one of his shows before I nearly chucked my television out a window .
I think Drew Magary over on Deadspin described the new version best :
Blue used to be an animated dog who could n’t speak .
But then they gave her some special room where she turned into a fucking puppet and started talking , and the show suddenly became the evil demon twin of its predecessor .
“ Blue ’s Room ” is dumb , annoying , grating , and worse than superAIDS .
Steve is not exactly cool on the show , but it ’s nice to know that he ’s cool in real life .
Also , he was among People magazine ’s 2000 most eligible bachelors .
1. Michelle Lepe ( “ The Goodnight Show ” ) : Lepe hosts “ The Goodnight Show , ” which is essentially a block of kids ’ programs that includes “ Kipper , ” “ Calliou , ” “ The Berenstein Bears , ” and a series of other shows that do n’t really fit within the half - hour television schedule .
So , Lepe hangs out on a couch with a star puppet , sings songs , and otherwise kills time between the episodes .
She ’s basically the only reason to stick around and suffer through the commercials .
She ’s comely .
Hell , she ’s an attractive woman , and if your kid is sick and can’t sleep , you could do worse than spend the wee hours of morning with Lepe .
The more amusing point , however , is that Lepe replaced Melanie Martinez , who was also a looker , but who lost her job after a video of her in high school jokingly advocating anal sex ( as a means of avoiding pregnancy ) .

Tennessee 's football team probably wo n't win much more than half its games this season .
Safety Eric
Berry , the team 's star player , might not score a touchdown all year .
But that does n't matter .
In the school 's opinion , he should be considered for the Heisman Trophy .
Given an unusually rich slate of leading candidates , there could n't be a worse year to try to promote a longshot Heisman candidate .
But Tennessee 's athletic department has already put up 10 billboards across the South touting Mr. Berry and plans to spend roughly $ 10,000 on a PR campaign that includes mass mailings to reporters and viral videos .
" It 's just letting the country see who Eric Berry is , " says a Tennessee spokeswoman .
College football fans are famous for holding grudges .
Sometimes it's a blown call , a turncoat coach , a phantom touchdown or an old water jug that was n't promptly returned .
But in some parts of the country — and especially in the South — there 's one old grievance that still burns hotly .
When it comes to the Heisman , they say , the South gets a raw deal .
While the voting is designed to be egalitarian — the 870 media members who vote on the award are equally divided among the nation 's six major regions — for whatever reason , Heisman voters have not been kind to Southern football .
Since 1935 , the year of the first award , individuals from the Midwest have won 22 Heismans overall while the Southwest has claimed 16 and the West 11 .
The total for the South , as defined by the Heisman , is 12 ; and outside the state of Florida , it 's five — the last being Auburn 's Bo Jackson in 1985 .
Alabama , which owns the second - most consensus national championships among major schools behind Notre Dame , has never won .
Tennessee , which is the eighth - winningest major college team , has n't either .

Women held 49.83 % of the nation 's 132 million jobs in June and they 're gaining the vast majority of jobs in the few sectors of the economy that are growing , according to the most recent numbers available from the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
That 's a record high for a measure that 's been growing steadily for decades and accelerating during the recession .
At the current pace , women will become a majority of workers in October or November .
The data for July will be released Friday .
" It was a long historical slog to get to this point , " says labor economist Heidi Hartmann , president of the Institute for Women 's Policy Research .
The change reflects the growing importance of women as wage earners , but it does n't show full equality , Hartmann says .
On average , women work fewer hours than men , hold more part - time jobs and earn 77 % of what men make , she says .
Men also still dominate higher - paying executive ranks .
Women have been a growing share of the once heavily male labor force for nearly a century , recording big bumps during epochal events such as the Depression and World War II .
This time , the boost came from a severe recession that has been brutal on male - dominated professions such as construction and manufacturing .
Through June , men have lost 74 % of the 6.4 million jobs erased since the recession began in December 2007 .
Men have lost more than 3 million jobs in construction and manufacturing alone .
The only parts of the economy still growing — health care , education and government — have traditionally hired mostly women .
That dominance has increased in part because federal stimulus funding directed money to education , health care and state and local governments .
The Postal Service is cutting tens of thousands of unionized , blue - collar jobs dominated by men while new hires are expanding in teaching and other fields dominated by college - educated women .
The gender transformation is especially remarkable in local government 's 14.6 million - person workforce .
Cities , schools , water authorities and other local jurisdictions have cut 86,000 men from payrolls during the recession — while adding 167,000 women , according to the Bureau of Labor Statistics .
" Unemployment among men is n't going to last forever , " says University of Chicago economist Casey Mulligan .
" People will move from construction and manufacturing to industries that are creating new jobs . "
Mulligan expects the portion of jobs held by women to peak slightly above 50 % this year , then drop below half when the economy recovers and more men find work .
Equality in workforce numbers reflects a long - term cultural change , says Maureen Honey , author of Creating Rosie the Riveter , a book about the government 's campaign to persuade women to work outside the home during World War II .
" The image that the man has to be the breadwinner has changed , " Honey says .

From the Columbia Journalism Review a short lesson in modern newsroom economics .
Katie Couric ’s annual salary is more than the entire annual budgets of NPR ’s Morning Edition and All Things Considered combined .
Couric ’s salary comes to an estimated $ 15 million a year ; NPR spends $ 6 million a year on its morning show and $ 5 million on its afternoon one .
But hey , Katie interviewed Glenn Beck on the evening news , and then followed up by devoting the whole of her new online " news program " to Beck , who has a new book out .
A book from a publisher that happens to be owned by CBS .
When you consider that NPR is doing news and Couric is doing pitch sessions for CBS - owned products , it 's really not a fair comparison .
Billy Mays made about $ 10 million a year .
That 's a much better match up with Katie .

SARAH Palin is said to have pocketed a $ 7 million advance for the 400 - page memoir she turned in four months early , but she might not have such an easy time on the lecture circuit .
After quitting as governor of Alaska in July , Palin signed with the top - notch Washington Speakers Bureau , which also reps George W. Bush , Laura Bush , Condoleezza Rice , hero pilot Chesley Sullenberger , LA Dodgers manager Joe Torre and magician David Blaine .
Palin ’s bookers are said to be asking for $ 100,000 per speech , but an industry expert tells Page Six : “ The big lecture buyers in the US are paralyzed with fear about booking her , basically because they think she is a blithering idiot . ”
Many big lecture venues are subscription series , “ and they do n’t want to tick people off , ” said our source .
“ Palin is polarizing , and some subscribers might cancel if she ’s on the lineup . ”
Other lecture buyers are universities , which have a leftist slant , and corporations , which dislike controversy .
“ Palin is so uninteresting to so many groups — unless they are interested in moose hunting , ” said our insider .
“ What does she have to say ?
She ca n’t even describe what she reads . ”
Palin likely quit as governor just months after losing the election as John McCain ‘s vice - presidential running mate because of money .
“ She knew that if she waited until her term ended in 2010 , these opportunities would be gone , ” said a source .
“ She would have lost millions by staying in office . ”
Palin ’s “ Going Rogue : An American Life ” is described by Harper publisher John Burnham as “ her words , her life , and it ’s all there in full and fascinating detail . ”
Harper would n’t discuss what Palin was paid .
Lynn Vincent , Palin ’s collaborator , wrote the book so fast , publication has been moved up from the spring to Nov. 17 .
The cities of the future are massive , sprawling , beautiful monsters , covering entire coastlines — and in some cases , entire continents .
Whether it 's Judge Dredd 's Mega - Cities or William Gibson 's " Sprawl , " future cities always devour land .
Here 's a map of future megalopolises .

So why are these cities so overwhelmingly large ?
And where do they come from ?
Here 's a list , by region :
North America :
The city of North Am ( in Magnus Robot Fighter ) does just what it sounds like — it covers almost the entirety of North America , giving you lots and lots of space in which to ( what else ? ) fight robots .

Edinburgh / Glasgow — it 's not strictly speaking science fiction , but there 's a lot of talk about these two Scottish cities combining into one megalopolis in the coming century .
The two cities could soon be linked by a high - speed maglev train .
But it does n't appear that any science fiction authors have written about EdinGow yet .

A few weeks ago Andy Lester suggested to Promote Perl 6 by saying " Perl 5 " .
It 's a pity most of the comments had to deal with the " Perl 6 is vaporware " meme .
It is about as mature as calling Perl dead .
Anyway , the other day I searched for Perl for Windows an noticed that Strawberry Perl is not in the top 10 .
So while I know the number of downloads for Strawberry Perl is growing I guess many people still do n't find it .
One of the reasons for this I guess is that we always just refer to it as Strawberry Perl and hardly mention the fact that it is for Windows .
So I also would like to have a suggestions .
If you mention Strawberry Perl in a blog or on a web site , please link to it as
Strawberry Perl for Windows
In time it will help get it to a higher position .
Thank you .
Unwanted blooms of Cladophora algae throughout the Baltic and in other parts of the world are not entirely without a positive side .
A group of researchers at the Ångström Laboratory at Uppsala University have discovered that the distinctive cellulose nanostructure of these algae can serve as an effective coating substrate for use in environmentally friendly batteries .
The findings have been published in an article in Nano Letters .
“ These algae has a special cellulose structure characterised by a very large surface area , ” says Gustav Nyström , a doctoral student in nanotechnology and the first author of the article .
“ By coating this structure with a thin layer of conducting polymer , we have succeeded in producing a battery that weighs almost nothing and that has set new charge - time and capacity records for polymer - cellulose - based batteries . ”
Despite extensive efforts in recent years to develop new cellulose - based coating substrates for battery applications , satisfactory charging performance proved difficult to obtain .
However , nobody had tried using algal cellulose .
Researcher Albert Mihranyan and Professor Maria Strømme at the Nanotechnology and Functional Materials Department of Engineering Sciences at the Ångström Laboratory had been investigating pharmaceutical applications of the cellulose from Cladophora algae for a number of years .
This type of cellulose has a unique nanostructure , entirely different from that of terrestrial plants , that has been shown to function well as a thickening agent for pharmaceutical preparations and as a binder in foodstuffs .
The possibility of energy - storage applications was raised in view of its large surface area .
“ We have long hoped to find some sort of constructive use for the material from algae blooms and have now been shown this to be possible , ” says Maria Strømme , Professor in Nanotechnology and leader of the research group .
“ The battery research has a genuinely interdisciplinary character and was initiated in collaboration with chemist professor Leif Nyholm .
Cellulose pharmaceutics experts , battery chemists and nanotechnologists have all played essential roles in developing the new material . ”
The article in Nano Letters , in effect , introduces an entirely new electrode material for energy storage applications , consisting of a nanostructure of algal cellulose coated with a 50 nm layer of polypyrrole .
Batteries based on this material can store up to 600 mA per cm3 , with only 6 per cent loss through 100 charging cycles .
“ This creates new possibilities for large - scale production of environmentally friendly , cost - effective , lightweight energy storage systems , ” says Maria Strømme .
“ Our success in obtaining a much higher charge capacity than was previously possible with batteries based on advanced polymers is primarily due to the extreme thinness of the polymer layer , ” says Gustav Nyström .
Think you got what it takes to be sent on a mission to Mars , live out your Total Recall fantasies , and start a hydroponics garden with Don Cheadle ?
Well , tough crap , because the closest you 'll likely ever come to such an experience is being crammed into a simulator with a handful of similar lunatics , which is exactly the type of project a special space facility in Moscow is looking for volunteers to partake in .
Researchers are looking for European volunteers to participate in a simulated 520 - day Mars mission , which will also include approx 210 days of study time before the actual experiment begins .
The team will be made up of a diverse group of international crew members who will have to live and work inside a sealed location , where researchers will monitor the psychological and medical effects of long - duration space missions .
The project is being conducted by the ESA and Russia 's Institute of Biomedical Problems ( BMP ) , with hopes that the simulated mission will begin by 2010 .
Potential candidates should be 20 - 50 , in good health , no taller than 185 cm and motivated .
They 'll need to be fluent in either English or Russian , and should have a work experience background in either medicine , biology , life support systems engineering , computer engineering , electronic engineering or mechanical engineering .
Living in the US and want to sign up ?
Sorry neighbor , but we 're all out of luck .

Welcome
All blogs are really just small snapshots of a person 's mind , heart and soul as they evolve together through life ....
Small bits of the thread of life we weave together into the fabric of ourselves , in the hope we will make sense of our existence , individual and collective .
On this page , is the cloak I have fashioned from my fabric to warm myself in a universe which often makes little sense .
Inside my cloak , it is warm enough to face the blistering cold winds of the insane world in which I find myself .
If you find some a bit of ' the good stuff ' here , it has been my pleasure .
My mother hired a hitman to kill me :
The shocking story of a Muslim woman whose parents disapproved of her Western lifestyle
Ordeal : Sofia Hayat was imprisoned and her mother threatened to kill her because she led a Western lifestyle
The text message forwarded to me from my younger sister Saira was concise and chilling : ' Mum 's sent a hit man to kill you , ' it read .
' Be careful . '
As I read those words , my first instinct was n't fear or even shock , but simply survival .
I 'd become accustomed to behaviour like this from both my parents - behaviour that anyone else would find abhorrent - and I was emotionally numb to their threats .
But I also knew that my sister 's warning was deadly serious and my life was in real danger .
I 'd been in hiding for several weeks when I received the text .
I was born in Gravesend in Kent in 1974 and brought up there in a devout Muslim family with three sisters and two brothers .
My father Zammurrad , a factory worker , was a deeply religious man but violent towards my mother Surriya and my sisters Zarqa , now 38 , Saira , 33 , and Tahira , 32 .
I tried to be an obedient daughter , praying up to five times a day , but I never felt loved by my parents - or that I really belonged .
In turn , my parents viewed me as something of an oddity .
Perhaps it was because I loved performing .
From as young as five , acting and singing was in my blood and at school I won so many competitions for writing songs that if the teachers wanted a song for an assembly they 'd ask me to write one and I 'd get up on stage and sing it .
My love of singing and dancing was n't exactly encouraged at home , but it was n't a big problem when I was young .
But as I hit my teens , my parents told me I could no longer continue .
I was to forget my childish fantasies of becoming an actress , as in their eyes singing and dancing were on a par with prostitution .
As I grew older , my father started placing increasingly severe restrictions on my life .
I was forbidden from making friends with other children and lived a very lonely existence .
On the one occasion I was given special permission to attend a birthday party of a girl who lived 100 metres down the road , I was allowed to stay for only an hour .
My life was just school and home , with no free time for myself .
I was to forget my childish fantasies of becoming an actress , as in their eyes it was on a par with prostitution
Throughout my childhood , my father grew more aggressive towards my mother and sisters , regularly throwing plates and knives at us in anger .
My brothers Majid , now 31 , and Wajid , 29 , were allowed to do as they pleased , but my sisters and I were told that Muslim girls were like a white sheet ; once stained , forever ruined .
If ever I returned home even five minutes late from the park or school , my father would hit me with his belt , often until I bled .
It got so bad that my sisters and I used to wear five layers of clothing to protect ourselves .
On one family outing to Margate when I was about nine , I was ten minutes late back to our meeting point , as I 'd stayed to watch a Punch and Judy show .
My father broke a branch from a tree , stripped off all the leaves and started whipping me with it in broad daylight .
Despite her family 's disapproval and attempts to stop her through imprisonment , Sofia has gone on to have a successful modelling and acting career
Incredibly , the rest of my family stood there and did nothing .
As an adult I can see how wrong this was , but at the time I just accepted it .
We all did .
I had grown up under Dad 's tyrannical rule and I knew no different .
Even when I 'd been sexually abused by a male relative as a young teenager , instead of supporting me my parents blamed me for accepting presents from him and accused me of lying .
It was from that day on I realised that I had to look after myself .
When I was 13 , I was flown to Pakistan to meet my 14 - year - old cousin , who I was told I would marry when I turned 18 .
As soon as he saw me , he said I was too ugly to marry and rejected me in favour of my 12 - year - old sister Saira .
They married six years later .
While in Pakistan , my mother took me to see a Holy Man to ask him what was wrong with me .
He told her I had a bad spirit in me and gave me a prayer to say every day and a bracelet to wear .
I was so angry that my own mother seemed to be listening to a man she 'd only just met , but had never had the time for me .
I knew then that my only way to escape a future of misery was through education .
If ever I returned home late from the park or school , my father would hit me with his belt , often until I bled
Despite the control they had over me , my mother and father thought that a degree in science , medicine or law was the perfect goal for one of their unmarried daughters and so , at the age of 18 , I started a Biology and Management degree at Sussex University and moved into student accommodation in a square near the old pier in Brighton .
I hated the course and secretly switched to a performing arts and music degree at Brighton University , which I loved .
But as my parents were unable to finance me , I supported myself with three different jobs - including three nights a week earning £ 50 a night as a dancer in a nightclub .
Finally , I was enjoying my life and my freedom .
But one evening a TV camera crew came to the club and captured me wearing just a cowboy hat , a short skirt and a Wonderbra .
Of course , I knew I was being filmed and I knew there was a slim chance my parents might see it .
But I was living away from home , enjoying the independence and , naively , I also thought that if they did see me performing , it might make them realise how passionate I was about acting .
Victims : Like Sofia , Samaira Nazir , left , and Banaz Mahmod were accused of ' dishonouring ' their families - and it cost them their lives
Needless to say , a friend of my parents saw the programme .
A couple of nights later , as I returned to my flat at about 3 am someone pulled the door open as I shut it .
' You 're coming home with me now .
I 'm taking you away from this lifestyle , ' said a voice .
It was my mother .
I told her I was n't going anywhere and she started screaming at me .
That 's when my 15 - year - old brother Majid , who 'd illegally driven my mother all the way from Kent , appeared from behind her brandishing a kitchen knife .
Majid was heavily built , so I genuinely feared that he was capable of using the knife .
My mother had once said ' If anyone dishonours this family , first I will kill them and then kill myself ' , so I knew that she too was serious .
I got into the car and we arrived back in Kent in the early hours of the morning .
I was marched into the cellar , which had been turned into a makeshift bedroom , and my brother stood in the doorway holding the knife .
My mother calmly said : ' From now on , we 're going to look after you and you 're going to do what we say . '
There was nothing I could do .
I sat there in silence , thinking my new life was now over .
To my relief , my father was abroad at the time .
I 'm still not sure how instrumental he was in my abduction , but if he had been there in person I 'm sure things would have turned even nastier .
For several weeks I lived in that cellar .
My meals were brought to me and I was accompanied to the toilet .
My mother had once said ' If anyone dishonours this family , first I will kill them and then kill myself '
Although I was n't physically locked in the room , there was no way I could escape without being noticed , because the only exit was through the adjacent living room , which was always occupied .
I was allowed no communication with the outside world , so I had no idea whether anyone from college had tried to contact me .
Initially , I was so traumatised that I did n't even think about escaping .
But as the days turned into weeks , I pleaded with my mother to let me return to my old job at the local supermarket , where I 'd worked part - time before I went to college .
Eventually , she agreed , provided I was escorted to and from work .
It was a relief to be finally able to escape and only a fortnight after I returned I confided in a colleague , Graham , about what was happening at home .
Horrified , he offered to help me escape .
It was a dangerous plan , but I could see no other way out .
My family had me under close surveillance , but at about noon one October lunchtime I sneaked out of the shop and jumped into the back of Graham 's car and lay flat on the floor , out of sight .
All I had with me were the clothes I was wearing and nothing else .
But I did n't care - I was getting away .
Graham took me to Brighton , but when I arrived at my old flat , my flatmate greeted me at the door .
Distorted reading : Sofia blames the way the Koran has been interpreted for her parents ' cruel behaviour
' You 've got to go , ' he said .
' Your mother saw you sneaking into a car outside your work and has just called me to check if you were here .
She 's on her way here now to check the house . '
I was terrified .
Graham immediately drove me to another friend 's house 30 minutes away , where I laid low , too scared even to leave the house .
That 's how I remained for the next month .
Every time I heard a car pass or a door open , I thought I was about to be recaptured .
People might wonder why I did n't contact the police at this stage .
The truth was , I was too embarrassed and confused to tell them that my own family were trying to kidnap me .
I just wanted to hibernate .
Then my sister forwarded my mother 's fateful text message and I felt more alone than ever .
I managed to summon up the energy to report the text to Hove police , who were amazing .
They went straight to my mum's house and warned her that if she came anywhere near me she would be immediately arrested and sent to prison .
They did n't pursue the hitman claim , but told me that if any more threats were made , I should contact them straight away .
That seemed to work .
The police gave me an emergency number to contact should I receive any more threats and for two months I heard nothing .
Then my old flatmate called , saying that my mum had phoned , desperate to speak to me as my father had suffered a heart attack .
Despite everything that had happened , I called my mum to ask about my father .
She assured me she would n't try to kidnap me again , but needed to talk .
We arranged to meet in a public place in Brighton , with the police watching .
As I walked to meet her , I was n't hoping for a reconciliation .
How could I repair a mother - daughter relationship that never existed in the first place ?
The first thing my mother said was that she was n't going to harm me or take me away , but it quickly transpired that my dad had n't had a heart attack at all .
Instead , my mother wanted to make one final appeal to me to give up my performing and my lifestyle and return home to get married and live a respectable Muslim life .
I flatly refused .
' Fine , ' she said , coldly .
' From now on you 're dead in our eyes and I do n't want to see you again . '
She walked away .
I do n't blame my parents for what they 've put me through , I blame the fact that Islam has become so distorted
As we parted , I wept .
I 'd never felt like I 'd belonged in my family , but at that point I did feel truly , truly alone in the world .
But a part of me dared to hope that she 'd meant what she 'd said , so that I could finally get on with my life unimpeded .
And that 's exactly what happened for the next ten years .
I completed my degree and since then I 've gone on to appear in many TV programmes , such as Waterloo Road and Footballers '
Wives , as a supporting actor .
I recorded a song which reached No6 in the MTV charts and sang at the Royal Albert Hall .
I 'm even appearing in a movie called The Unforgettable later this year .
I 'm really living the life I dreamed of all those years ago .
I 've broken off all contact with my father , but I did start seeing my sister Saira again about four years ago , when her arranged marriage collapsed and she remarried and had children .
I see her family regularly and through her children I eventually came back into contact with my mother two years ago .
I was petrified that she 'd reject me again , but she is now separated from my father and seems quieter and more at peace .
We see each other every couple of months , but there 's little mention of what happened before and I know deep down she will never be proud of what I am and who I 've become .
It 's taken a lot of therapy to come to a position of understanding and self awareness but , despite everything that has happened , I do n't blame my parents for what they 've put me through .
I blame the fact that Islam has become so distorted and warped .
I do n't believe that the Muslim religion condones any sort of violence ; Islam literally means ' peace ' .
The greeting from one Muslim to another - ' aasalamolaykom ' - means : ' Peace be with you . '
If only people would actually read the Koran for themselves , they would see the love and peace it radiates and the equality among men and women it promotes .
If only my parents had been able to give me that kind of love .

Heart attack fells woman who contested eviction for smoking pot
by Andy Ivens , The Province
Marilyn Holsten ’s last days on Earth were a living hell , according to her sister , Moira O’Neill .
In frail health , the almost - blind , diabetic double - amputee was ordered evicted from her apartment because of her need to smoke marijuana to control her pain .
Holsten , 48 , died earlier this month from a heart attack .
“ For a whole year , it went on .
It was an unbelievable way to treat someone in her health , ” said O’Neill .
Holsten lived in a building operated by Anavets Senior Citizens Housing Society in the 900 - block East 8th Avenue in Vancouver .
Many of her neighbours told her they did not smell marijuana coming from her apartment , her sister said .
But , even though Holsten eventually obtained legal permission to smoke marijuana to deal with excruciating phantom pains , Anavets sought her eviction because of the smell of pot .
“ It was a witch hunt , ” said O’Neill , who said her sister had to move from her fifth - floor apartment to a ground - floor suite two years ago , after her first leg amputation , for her own safety .
“ They knew she smoked marijuana before she moved down to the other suite , ” said O’Neill .
“ She was in the hospital most of the time , with her amputation — she was gone five days a week , in dialysis six hours a day . ”
Holsten fought her eviction at a B.C. Residential Tenancy Branch arbitration hearing in June , but lost .
The night before she died , Holsten visited her older sister .
“ We resolved that she was going to stay with me in my small one - bedroom apartment , ” said O’Neill .
“ She could n’t take opiates , they made her totally unable to function .
Morphine made her throw up , and she was a diabetic , so she had to eat all the time . ”
O’Neill said her sister “ yelled and screamed before she died , ” but help came too late to save her .
“ It ’s pretty unjust , what happened .
She was a fighter , ” said O’Neill , who picked up her sister ’s ashes Tuesday .
“ She was extremely independent all her life . ”
O’Neill says her sister was also “ a beautiful person ” who loved life and her three parrots .
“ She had an art project she was working on .
She had plans to continue her education .
She was an inspirational person , ” said O’Neill .
“ I ’m missing her , but I know she ’s got her toes back and is wiggling them in heaven . ”

Sick Woman Evicted For Smoking Pot
by Cheryl Chan , The Province
May 6th , 2009
A double amputee who uses a wheelchair is being evicted from her Vancouver apartment at the end of the month for smoking medicinal pot .
“ I ’m really scared , ” said Marilyn Holsten .
“ I do n’t want to be out on the streets .
I do n’t have anywhere to go . ”
Holsten , a 49 - year - old diabetic who is also losing sight in her right eye , has lived for eight years in a building run by the non-profit Anavets Senior Citizens ’ Housing Society .
“ I get these terrible ghost pains , ” she said .
“ Doctors say there ’s nothing that ’ll work for it , so the only thing they suggested was to try pot . ”
When she started smoking pot — about a gram a day — she gave a note from her doctor to the society that runs the building on East 8th Ave .
She got her first eviction notice in April 2008 .
In order to stay , she signed a document promising that she would light up outdoors only .
“ I was exhausted .
I did n’t have time to fight , ” said Holsten .
Last month , she received her second eviction notice after management said the smell of marijuana from her suite was wafting into the public areas .
Holsten said she tries to smoke outside , but admits she smokes in her room when she wakes up in pain in the middle of the night .
She does her best to diffuse the smell , she said — keeping her window open , using a fan and sprays .
Holsten ’s physician , Dr. Fraser Norrie , supports her pot use .
“ I agree with this medical treatment , ” he wrote in a letter to the housing society .
“ I would ask you to accept her medical needs , including her need to smoke marijuana . ”
But the doctor ’s note was n’t enough for building management .
“ While your doctor supports your decision to use marijuana , he has not prescribed it for medicinal purposes , ” society administrator Mary McLeod wrote in a letter to Holsten dated April 24 .
“ Marijuana use is still against the law and … [ as ] part of your tenancy agreement , you agreed you would not participate in illegal activities . ”
Anavets refused an interview request .
Holsten said she does not have the Health Canada authorization to possess pot .
She had considered applying for the authorization last year , but was daunted by the paperwork .
“ I ’ve had a lot of health stuff going on , ” she said .
“ I was really trying , but it ’s a lot of work . ”
Jason Gratl , vice - president of the B.C. Civil Liberties Association , said a person should not be evicted unless his or her behaviour unreasonably interferes with the landlord ’s and neighbouring tenants ’ rights .
“ I doubt smoking medicinal marijuana constitutes an unreasonable interference sufficient to justify evicting a double amputee . ”
Jay Leung , spokesman for the B.C. Compassion Club , said the right of the ill to have access to medicinal pot without fear of prosecution has been established as a constitutional right , “ but this is not yet reflected in tenancy law . ”
He called the federal marijuana access program a “ half - hearted attempt , ” with authorizations granted to less than 3,000 people across Canada in the past eight years .
The 5,000 members of the compassion club , which has been operating on Commercial Drive since 1997 , are in a grey area , said Leung .
“ Members are not protected legally , but morally they are , because society recognizes there is a medicinal purpose for their use . ”
Holsten remains on the B.C. Housing wait list and said she has no objections to moving if she can get a wheelchair - accessible suite or an assisted - living unit elsewhere .
“ It ’s very stressful , ” she said .
“ I do n’t know what ’s going to happen .
Maybe I should feel lucky it ’s summer .
At least if I ’m on the streets , it ’s not winter yet . ”

Medical - Pot User Given Way To Eliminate Smell
by John Colebourn , The Province
May 7th , 2009
Wheelchair - bound double - amputee Marilyn Holsten is clearing the air in her pot-puffing fight with her landlord .
Holsten , who faces eviction at the end of the month because she smokes marijuana inside her East Vancouver suite , was yesterday given a vapourizer by pot activist Marc Emery and his wife , Jodie .
Emery and his wife dropped the $ 750 German - made Volcano Vaporizer off at Holsten ’s suite on East 8th Avenue and she wasted no time in putting it to use .
Besides the donated vapourizer , Holsten was also given a baggie of Blueberry Island Sweet Skunk , a marijuana variant prized by pot puffers .
After a quick instructional session on using the high - end machine , Holsten took a few tokes and sang praise of the machine that allows her to get stoned while eliminating smoke .
“ Wow is this ever nice , it does n’t burn your throat , ” said Holsten , 49 , who uses marijuana to help with the unbearable pain she gets in the stumps of her legs .
Holsten is a diabetic and has lived for more than eight years in a building run by the nonprofit Anavets Seniors Citizens Housing Society .
After pot smoke was detected coming from her suite , she was given an eviction notice in April 2008 .
In order to stay , she was forced to sign a document promising to light up outdoors only .
Then last month Holsten was given a final eviction notice after management said the smell of pot was noticed in public areas of the building .
Despite having a doctor ’s note saying she needs to smoke marijuana to ease her pain , the landlord told her to find another place .
Emery , who faces possible extradition to the U.S. on drug charges next month , said he is hearing of cases similar to Holsten ’s .
“ We know of many people who are using medical marijuana who are running into problems with their landlords , ” he said .
Holsten has appealed her eviction and has a hearing June 9 with the Residential Tenancy Branch .

Local authorities and fishermen in the Thousand Islands regency have been working hand - in - hand over the last couple of years to harmonize conservation efforts with business interests .
Their efforts have borne significant change , particularly in the way the fishermen make a living while sustaining marine biodiversity .
Before the islands were officially declared one of seven national marine parks in the country in 1995 , they faced serious threats to more than 134 species of coral reefs and other endangered marine life , including the hawksbill turtle , the green turtle and the giant abalone .
Thousand Islands National Marine Park head Joko Prihatno says the threats came from destruc -
tive fishing methods using explosives , and the large - scale plunder of living coral .
“ Business interests often run counter to efforts to save the environment , and so that ’s why we ’re trying to find common gro ...

Currently , Ethernet standard offers an upper - limit to maximum no. of ports that can be connected on a Ethernet LAN .
This limit not particular to a vendor but rather to do with standard and current electronics .
A standard Back - plane of a switch can handle several 100s of Gigabits of traffic in all .
But consider this , 100 switchports - each 10 GBps , we already run out of the available back - plane capacity .
You ca n’t think of adding more switch - ports .
Also , Current Ethernet standards cannot assure FullDuplex exceeding 100 GBps , reliably .
But most data centers we see today have 100,000 servers or other nodes .
We segment , distribute , subnet such large network data - centers resulting in in -efficiencies and higher maintenance and manual management pertaining to more hardware .
But there is a solution .
University of California ( UoC ) at San Diego researchers Tuesday are presenting a paper describing software that they say could make data center networks massively scalable .
The researchers say their PortLand software will enable Layer 2 data center network fabrics scalable to 100,000 ports and beyond , and they even have a prototype running at the school ’s Department of Computer Science and Engineering ’s Jacobs School of Engineering .
Their breakthrough is outlined in paper titled “ PortLand : A scalable Fault - Tolerant Layer 2 Data Center Network Fabric ” that is being presented at the SIGCOMM 2009 event in Barcelona this week .
“ With PortLand , we came up with a set of algorithms and protocols that combine the best of layer 2 and layer 3 network fabrics , ” said Amin Vahdat , senior author of the paper and a computer science professor at UC San Diego , in a statement .
“ Today , the largest data centers contain over 100,000 servers .
Ideally , we would like to have the flexibility to run any application on any server while minimizing the amount of required network configuration and state . ”
The data center has been a hotbed of activity among leading vendors such as Cisco , HP , Juniper and IBM , some of which are retrofitting existing offerings and others of which are building products from scratch .
PortLand will work with existing hardware and routing protocols , according to the researchers , which include graduate students who worked with Vahdat .
“ Our goal is to allow data center operators to manage their network as a single fabric , ” according to Vahdat , who maintains a blog called Idle Process .
“ We are working toward a network that administrators can think of as one massive 100,000 - port switch seamlessly serving over one million virtual endpoints . ”
Key to this is the development of system for servers to find one another without broadcasting their requests across an entire network .
Under PortLand , switches use what are called Pseudo MAC addresses and a directory service to locate servers they need to connect , including new virtual servers .
The researchers say this setup can eliminate much of the manual labor required to build a Layer 3 network .

By all rights , the final edition of the 2008 - 09 high - school newspaper - which featured stories on a math teacher 's retirement and a preview of the prom - should have been tossed into their mental recycling bin by now .
After all , the paper 's business manager , Sophia Curran , is focusing on business in her senior year and is not returning to the paper .
And editor Vaughn Hillyard has graduated and enrolled in college .
Yet Curran and Hillyard can't put the paper behind them .
They are still stewing about the May 8 issue of The Challenge , Thunderbird High School 's student newspaper .
Not because of what was in it .
But because of what was not .
On the day the issue was to go to press , the principal pulled the plug on a front - page story about student testing , deeming the story to be inaccurate and the reporting slanted .
The newspaper staff decided to leave the year 's final issue with a blank , 8 1/2 - inch square of white space dominating the cover .
" We were n't going to fill the hole , " Hillyard said .
" It was this story or nothing . "
The headline of the censored story - " District testing stirs questions among teachers " - does n't make the article appear very controversial .
But the story struck a raw nerve with the Glendale Union High School District administration , the two editors believe , prompting the principal to order it yanked , which , as de facto publisher , he had the power to do .
The district superintendent , Jennifer Johnson , denied that the article received extra scrutiny because it was critical of a test that is a point of pride for the district .
She offered to edit the story and have the revised version printed in a special edition before school let out .
" It 's not like some blacklisted topic , " Johnson said .
Hillyard refused to consider a district - approved article , believing that the original story was solid .
" We do n't want to let this one go , " said Hillyard , now enrolled in Arizona State University 's school of journalism .
" It 's a loss for us .
It 's a loss for journalism .
We still firmly believe we were right . "
He said he was inspired to keep up the fight , especially after the death of legendary newsman Walter Cronkite , whose name graces ASU 's journalism school .
Hillyard said he read obituaries and watched documentaries about Cronkite that detailed his fight to expose the Watergate scandal and report that government officials were giving a too - rosy picture of the Vietnam War .
" It goes perfectly with our case , " Hillyard said .
" That 's what the purpose ( of journalism ) is . . . bring out stories that normally would not be shared . "
For Curran , who took journalism only because it was the last open elective , the fight is more personal .
" I could have finished all my homework that night instead of doing ( the story ) , " she said .
" We went through all that energy to get the quotes . . . to get the picture , and it was like it was all for nothing . "
Hillyard and Curran have spent the summer researching court cases and district policies , fueled by a mix of passion for telling their story and frustration with the district 's bureaucratic decision - making process .
" We want to be told that we were right , " Hillyard said .
" We want them to admit they were wrong . "
The Challenge , like other newspapers , was striving to maintain its youthful readership in a changing media environment .
As the 2008 - 09 school year began , the paper 's editors decided to concentrate on issues that mattered most to students at the school .
That meant fewer stories about the Ping - Pong club and more stories on subjects such as alcohol , marijuana and " sexting , " or sending sexually explicit text messages .
The paper 's faculty adviser , Sheri Siwek , said Principal Matt Belden raised an eyebrow on some stories but did not interfere with their publication .
" To his credit , " she said , " he was really trying to let the kids write relevant articles . "
Interest in the school paper seemed to increase .
Staffers noticed that more students were reading the paper at lunch hour and discussing it in the hallways .
" It was kind of a new thing for us , " Hillyard said .
Before the year 's final issue , the students gathered to pitch story ideas .
One student suggested a story about the Performance Based Assessment test , a five - day written exam that 's administered in most classes .
The test is a crown jewel for the Glendale district , which has used it for decades to monitor skills taught in each classroom .
It has been glowingly written about in education books and journals .
Yet students routinely heard teachers criticizing the tests .
" Teachers are always calling out the test , " Hillyard said .
" They 're saying it was a waste of time .
They 're vocal . "
The newsroom crackled with excitement about the subject .
" It was like , ' Why did n't we think of this before ? ' " Hillyard said .
A reporter , Teresa Hauer , who was finishing her first year on the staff , volunteered to take the story on .
One of her first interviews would be with Principal Belden during his regularly scheduled session with The Challenge staff .
The discussion , which involved Hauer , Curran and Hillyard , became oddly heated , Curran said .
" You could tell by his answers that it was like touching a sacred topic , " she said .
Belden talked about the test for a while , then shut down , the editors recalled .
He said the paper should get answers from the district .
The student reporter e-mailed a district official and the superintendent but did not receive a reply .
In the ensuing weeks , the students talked to teachers who agreed to have critical comments about the test used in the article .
They also placed an anonymous survey in teachers ' mailboxes .
The results indicated that teachers were against the test .
Through their adviser , the students learned that their reporting was creating a stir among administrators .
On the morning the story was due , the editors met with Belden .
It was clear that the principal did n't want the story to run , but the students thought that they had shot down his arguments .
They left the meeting feeling confident they had won the day .
" We were almost arrogant , " Curran recalled .
" He ( Belden ) ca n't say no .
He can't do it . "
But he could .
Hillyard said that at 2:45 p.m. , Belden called to say the story had been killed .
District policy allows a principal to remove a story from the paper if he or she feels it is inaccurate , biased or would cause a disruption at the school .
Belden , through a district spokesman , refused The Arizona Republic 's request for an interview .
After the story was killed , the staff of The Challenge briefly discussed splashing " Censored " across the front page .
But Hillyard thought that would be tacky and that it was best to leave the story 's space blank .
" Through this whole thing , " he said , " ( we ) remained respectful . "
Two days later , staffers delivered the paper to classrooms and could hear the gasps and questions from students .
" I think we got the response we wanted , " Hillyard said .
Since then , Curran and Hillyard have found themselves , unwittingly at times , ensnared in a district appeals process .
Hearings have been taped .
Their testimony has been timed .
They 've lost at every turn .
" It 's really easy to get discouraged , " Curran said .
" How can we win ?
It 's always being judged by someone inside the system . "
Superintendent Johnson , in a written decision , detailed several problems with the article and how it was reported .
The survey , she said , did not reflect the views of a majority of the teachers on the staff , as the article said , just those who responded .
Additionally , Johnson wrote , the student reporter 's questions to the administration showed bias .
One , for instance , asked why the district could not eliminate the test rather than make staffing cuts .
" I understand the passion the students bring , " Johnson said during a phone interview , adding that the school has a responsibility to teach fair and accurate reporting .
" That does n't mean that students get to do what they want . "
The students pleaded their case at an Aug. 19 meeting of the Glendale district board .
But , as they had expected , the board unanimously voted that the decision to kill the article was proper .
Now the students are looking to go to court .
Hillyard moved into a dorm next to ASU 's Cronkite School in downtown Phoenix the week of that district board meeting and has started his college career .
But seeing the name of the CBS News legend every day reminds him why he is still battling his former high school :
" It 's become more of a realization it is something we need to do . "
Curran expects this to be her last journalism battle , but she said she has learned a lot from it .
The principal and superintendent , she said , probably expected the students , and the issue , to have gone away by now .
" Little do they know , " she said , " they 're dealing with passionate people . "

Nina Munk ’s VF article on Harvard ’s endowment is n’t online , but the précis is , and it seems that Larry Summers takes a particular beating , being blamed for $ 1 billion in losses on interest - rate swaps , as well as for meddling with Harvard Management Company ’s investment strategies and ultimately , with Bob Rubin , being responsible for the departure of Jack Meyer .
The result ?
Munk asked the hedge fund manager to look at Harvard ’s finances and assess the extent to which its endowment will be able to keep pace with its immovable costs .
The hedge fund manager ’s conclusion : “ They are completely fucked . ”
Is it really as bad as all that ?
Yes , probably — especially given the way in which both Harvard president Drew Faust and HMC CEO Jane Mendillo seem to be incapable of taking tough decisions .
But hey , at least Harvard still has its triple - A credit rating .
That must be worth something , right ?
Er , maybe not :
In December , the university sold $ 2.5 billion worth of bonds , increasing its total debt to just over $ 6 billion .
Servicing that debt alone will cost Harvard an average of $ 517 million a year through 2038 .
$ 517 million per year works out at more than $ 20,000 per student per year .
Yikes .
Comics artist Junko Mizuno ( " Strange Tales " ) recently designed a custom My Little Pony for Hasbro , and it got me wondering whether there were more comic book versions of the collectible horsey toys of my youth .
It turns out that there 's a very active My Little Pony modding community that has produced AMAZING versions of everything from Galactus ( complete with teeny tiny Silver Surfer ) to every major Batman character , and even the cult web favorite Dr. Horrible .

And ok -- " Star Wars " is n't technically superheroes , but the last two pony mods were just too amazing to leave out .
Many of the modders do commissions as well , so follow the links to them if you want one of your own .

With search engine algorithms weighting quality more heavily EduLinks can help you to attain a higher page rank more quickly .
Organic SEO
Marketing knows how to get these valuable EduLinks for you and we make that acquisition a priority in all of our SEO campaigns .
Anchor Text : Anchor text is a way to place a link into an article or blog post and create yet another path back to your website .
This type of back link is particularly effective because the text that it is embedded in is generally something that is relevant to the product or service you are offering .
When that text is reviewed by the reader they just might be looking for something that you sell .
Not only will you get the link juice that helps your page position , but you 'll get some direct traffic as well .
Article Submission : Articles are a great way to talk about what you have to offer without being blatantly promotional .
The educated consumers of today want to be able to read about something and make their own decision , not have a product or service 's benefits exhorted to them over and over again .
The links that you can get from both anchor text and the resource box of an article directory are also great for helping you move up in search engine page rank for your industry keywords .
Directory Submission :
The directories of today are not like those big yellow books that your parents and grandparents used to use .
They are electronic databases that contain millions of bits and bytes of information about websites in every industry .
Submitting your business to these directories is a time consuming process that you 'll need to have a professional take care of for you .
Organic SEO marketing knows which directories will benefit you and which are simply a waste of time .
Directory submission is a standard part of every search engine optimization campaign we run .

White Americans , anyway .

Do you believe that America and Africa were once part of the same continent ?
Yes No Not SureAll 42 26 32 Dem 51 16 33 Rep 24 47 29 Ind 44 23 33 Northeast 50 18 32 South 32 37 31 Midwest 46 22 32 West 43 24 33 White 35 30 35 Black 63 13 24 Latino 55 19 26 Other 56 19 25
Probably readers of this blog are not a representative sample of Americans , and most or you -- even the white people ! -- know that Pangaea was the supercontinent that existed about 250 million years ago , before plate tectonics worked its magic and broke it apart .
Now , some of my best friends are white folks , so I do n't want to make any grand generalizations about their intelligence or education .
But this is a good illustration of a point made by Jerry Coyne -- the problem of scientific illiteracy is not a simple one , and in particular it 's not just a matter of better outreach and more Carl Sagans .
Which is not to say that more and better outreach and science journalism is n't important or useful -- it clearly is , and I 'm in favor of making structural changes to provide much better incentives for making sure that it happens .
But there are also factors at work for which outreach is n't the answer -- political and social forces that push people away from science .
Those have to be confronted if we want to really address the problem .
( I do n't know who was the mischievous person who thought of asking this poll question in the first place , but it was an inspired idea . )
Update : Aaron Golas in comments points to a post by Devilstower laying out that the question was worded in an intentionally provocative way , to illustrate how bad questions can fail to correctly gauge scientific understanding .
Which is completely true , and a point worth making .
But I argue that the poll does reveal something , namely the extent to which underlying cultural attitudes can influence one 's stance toward purportedly scientific questions .
Thus , " White People Have Trouble Accepting Pangaea , " not " White People Don't Know About Pangaea . "
As a measure of what percentage of Americans truly understand continental drift , the poll is pretty useless ; as an indication of how culture affects that understanding , it 's very illuminating .
The FDIC is in Trouble
As we all know , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation ( FDIC ) guarantees depositors that they ’ll get their money back if a bank fails , at least up to a certain amount .
To fund its operations , the FDIC collects small fees from the banks that are held in reserve for the purpose of taking over troubled banks and paying off depositors .
Since the Great Depression , a period marked by widespread runs on banks , the FDIC has done a good job of fulfilling its mandate .
So how are they doing in this crisis ?
In a nutshell , they are in trouble .
The FDIC insures 8,246 institutions , with $ 13.5 trillion in assets .
Not all of them are going bankrupt , of course .
Yet as of late July , a disturbing 64 banks had gone belly up this year – the most since 1992 – costing the FDIC $ 12.5 billion .
At the end of Q1 , the agency was already asking for emergency funding .
And worse , much worse , is likely yet to come .
The following chart shows the total assets on the books of the FDIC ’s list of 305 troubled banks .
The list does n’t include the biggest banks that are considered too big to fail , as they are being separately supported with bailouts .
By contrast , if the banks on this list fail , the FDIC is on the hook to have to step in and take them over and , of course , make depositors whole .
Other measures of how serious the losses at banks are becoming can be seen in the chart below , which shows charge - offs and non-current loans at all banks .
You can see that the Net Charge - offs remain stubbornly high , with banks charging off almost $ 40 billion in bad loans in the last two quarters alone .
And the number of non-current loans – loans where payments are not being kept up – is soaring .
Together , these measures indicate the potential for more big failures and more big bailouts coming down the pike .
Into the battle against bank insolvency the Fed brings a level of reserves that can best be described as paper - thin .
From almost $ 60 billion last fall , the FDIC ’s reserves have been drawn down to only about $ 13 billion today , a 16 - year low .
A quick look at the FDIC ’s own data shows us how inadequate those reserves are compared to the deposits they are now insuring .
The chart below says it all :
As you can see , the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation currently covers each dollar on deposit with a trivial 2/10 ths of a penny .
And even that understates the seriousness of the situation : the $ 4.8 trillion in deposits the FDIC is providing coverage on does n’t include the expansion that now extends insurance coverage from $ 100,000 to $ 250,000 for normal bank accounts .
That likely brings the exposure of the FDIC closer to $ 6 trillion .
But that ’s pretty inconsequential at this point : using any reasonable accounting method , the FDIC is already bankrupt and will require hundreds of billions of dollars in government bailouts just to keep the doors open .
So , given the dire shape of its finances , what measures is the FDIC taking , you know , to batten down the hatches and all that ?
For starters , they are expanding their mandate by guaranteeing bank loans – $ 350 billion and counting at this point .
And the government has tapped the FDIC to play a pivotal role in guaranteeing the loans issued to buy toxic waste through the government ’s highly problematic and fraud - prone new Private Public Investment Partnership ( PPIP ) .
The FDIC ’s commitment to the PPIP is and may become limited based on its resources .
It is hard to draw any other conclusion but that hundreds of billions in new funding will be required to keep the FDIC operating .
Given the catastrophic consequences of the FDIC failing , starting with a bank run of biblical proportions , there ’s no question it will get whatever funding it needs .
By loading the new loan guarantee responsibilities and the PPIP onto the FDIC ’s back , the administration will go back to Congress and ask for the next large bailout .
Of course , in the end , all of this falls on the taxpayer , either directly in the form of more taxes or indirectly via the destruction of the dollar ’s purchasing power .
Another bale of straw on the camel ’s back , and another reason to be concerned about holding paper dollars for the long term .

States rush to get high - speed rail applications ready
The Obama administration has set aside $ 8 billion in the stimulus package for high - speed rail projects , and states need to submit their applications by October 2 , 2009 .
Some have estimated that the aggregate dollar amount of the applications will exceed $ 100 billion , so competition is fierce .
These are n’t just emergency loans – this is money specifically tagged for building transportation infrastructure in cities that need it .
The Plain Dealer is reporting on the progress Ohio is making , and the enormous time and effort being devoted by government agencies and private individuals .
Ohio passenger rail advocates are moving at breakneck speed to fulfill requirements to apply for up to $ 450 million in federal stimulus money to provide service from Cleveland to Cincinnati .
They are seeking public input through a Web site , toll - free phone number and meetings across the state as part of an environmental assessment study that is required as part of the funding application , due by Oct. 2 to the Federal Rail Commission .
The study , which usually takes about a year , will be compiled in less than three months .
“ We are really compressing this process and a lot of it is driven by the tight timeline , ” said Stu Nicholson , spokesman for the Ohio Rail Development Commission , an independent agency of the Ohio Department of Transportation .
“ But I am not overstating this at all to say the level of interest from virtually every community large and small is very high . ”
Under Ohio ’s 3C plan , three trains would travel daily from Cleveland , Columbus , Dayton and Cincinnati in each direction along the 260 - mile corridor .
The service , with 79 - mph trains , would begin in 2011 with minimal stops .
It would eventually add more stops and become part of a 110 - mph high - speed network to connect west to Chicago and east to New York .
The trains would be operated by Amtrak on freight tracks owned by CSX and Norfolk Southern .
More than 6 million people live within 15 miles of the route , said ODOT spokesman Scott Varner .
The stimulus money will be down - payment on an even more aggressive federal push for high - speed rail , and as evidenced by the activity in Ohio , states are serious about moving forward .
The impact on the environment and on economic development can be significant .
Hopefully budget issues wo n’t impact the next wave of high - speed rail funding .
The hedge fund sign - off is a distinct art , ideally trumpeting the fund manager 's past accomplishments while burying the bad stuff under a warm blanket of " market conditions . "
Tim Barakett 's farewell letter from Atticus was no exception .
There is little mention of the redemptions that hampered the firm in recent years , nor the fund 's oft - contentious relations to its own investors .

The Ares I - X rocket will be test flown in October
The US space agency has completed the assembly of its Ares I - X rocket ahead of a test flight scheduled for October .
The Ares I rocket is a key component of Nasa 's next - generation space transportation system .
The agency will use Ares I to launch the Orion capsule - the spacecraft to be used for human space missions after the space shuttle retires .
The unmanned test version of the rocket is standing in the vehicle assembly building ( VAB ) at Kennedy Space Center .
The final segments of the Ares I - X rocket , including the simulated crew module and launch abort system , were stacked together on 13 August on a mobile launcher platform at the VAB in Florida .
Nasa has released images , providing the first look at the 99 m ( 327ft ) launch vehicle .
The Ares I - X flight test is targeted for 31 October .
Nasa is scheduled to retire the space shuttle in 2010 ; the completed Ares - Orion system is not due to fly until 2015 at the earliest .

Not to say that that 's terribly bad or anything , but how much of the same stuff can you take ?
Dexter has killed people since the first season , continued killing through the third season , and has wriggled out of any dangerous situation .
Other than a few bumps in the road , Dexter has gotten away with everything scot free .
His relationships with everyone have remained virtually the same .
So what do we look forward to ?
More killing ?
Episode to episode there are great twists , but at the end of the season , everything is reset .
I 'll stick around for the devilish directing and excellent acting headed by Michael C. Hall , but sooner or later , the lack of creativity will catch up with the show .
This season 's main story will be the Trinity Killer much in the vein of The Ice Truck Killer and the Skinner except he is much scarier .
In the very first episode , we see John Lithgow in action and it is absolutely terrifying .
He kills a woman naked in a bathtub filled with water and stays there as the blood spills out .
The manner in which he killed her and his total disregard for bathing in blood is just disturbing on so many levels .
This is the part of the season I 'm looking forward to the most .
Miami PD quickly picks up on the case and Dexter is hot on the trail of yet another serial killer .
The Trinity Killer is amazing , but when multiple serial killers flock to a single city within a short span , it requires a suspension of belief that quite frankly I dislike in this type of show .
Season 2 was unique with Lila , but the serial killer story gets old after a while .
I do n't understand why the writers can't take a risk and have people learn about Dexter 's secret without Dexter having to kill them .
Or maybe everyone learns his secret and he goes on trial .
Even if he is acquitted , that would at least up the ante to a point where we are genuinely surprised .
Keith Carradine is also back as retired FBI Special Agent Lundy .
With Debra still with Anton the CI , I 'm sure this will stir up trouble .
Lundy has been tracking the Trinity Killer for years and now ends back in Miami .
More fun ?
You betcha .
The only major change this season is Dexter 's family life .
He lives with Rita , her kids ( I guess his now ) , and their newborn son .
While this will certainly been amusing to watch and Dexter is a delightfully funny show at times , I highly doubt this will translate into good drama .
There are already repercussions from his baby .
Dexter messes up badly on the stand and a killer goes free .
Luckily he has an insatiable urge to kill people and the killer is the perfect target .
Too bad he gets called back by Rita .
The episode ends on a cliffhanger that is sure to keep people coming back .
Individually , it was a very good episode .
There was a nice mix of everything and the Trinity Killer looks like the best serial killer yet ( yes , even better than Dexter ! ) .
I love almost everything about this show except for long - term planning .
I think the quality of the show is still on par with the first season when everything was still fresh , but it's now the first season and it 's time for some changes .
Score : 9.2/10
A Queensland Indigenous leader says being sent to jail has become a badge of honour among many young Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders .
Indigenous people from all over Queensland are meeting in Brisbane to discuss ways to fight the high rate of reoffending within their community .
They have been told by the Queensland Corrective Services Department that the number of Indigenous people in the state 's jails has risen to almost a third of the total prison population .
Sam Watson , an activist and community leader , says it is a worrying trend .
" Looking at particular communities across Queensland , it almost seems to be some sort of rite of passage for young people to commit offences , go into custody and then from there go into jail , " he said .
" For a number of years now Hollywood has been presenting this sort of image of the glorified gangster who must make his bones by killing someone .
" Well , at a lesser level on the streets around Queensland , unless you 've done some hard time , then you 're not considered worthy of being part of the group .
" It 's that need to belong to the group .
It 's the need to prove yourself as a worthy contender . "
Mr Watson estimates every second Indigenous person who is released from prison reoffends within a year .
Aborigines and Torres Strait Islanders make up just over 3 per cent of Queensland 's population but they account for 28 per cent of people in jail .
A safe haven
The Budja Djan Men's Council president , Duncan Johnson , says many find life is easier inside prison .
" If you 're in a low - economic situation and you go into jail you get three meals a day , a bed , " he said .
" They have television , PlayStations , all that sort of stuff - everything is structured for them .
" So when they come out there 's no structure in the community for them and they find it hard to actually fit back into the community and society in itself . "
Mr Johnson says they sometimes reoffend in order to go back to jail .
" That 's what you call institutionalisation .
Yes , they reoffend because they feel more safer there , " he said .
He says existing rehabilitation programs for Indigenous offenders are inadequate .
" I do n't think they answer any of the problems affecting Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander children and adults in the male and female system , " he said .
" I think we 've got to look outside the box for some of the answers to them things , especially long - term . "
Room for improvement
Stephen Hagan , a lecturer at the University of Southern Queensland and a former Aboriginal Person of the Year , agrees the system must not be working .
" I think it 's very clear from the discussions in the meeting today that they do n't have the right personnel inside the prison system - I 'm talking about Indigenous personnel inside the prison system - to assist those who come in , " he said .
" And they do n't have half - way houses or people on the outside , as in probation officers , to speak to Indigenous people to stop them reoffending . "
The director of Indigenous coordination at Queensland Corrective Services , Michael Stubbins , also says there is room for improvement .
" It 's terrible , I mean there is no doubt that the statistics all show that there is continued over - representation of Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people , " he said .
" We have the third highest rate in Australia and we need to do further work in relation to how we address that . "
Starting young
Mr Watson says young Indigenous people are filling the state 's detention centres from as early as 11 - years - old .
" At the Brisbane Youth Detention Centre I think there 's about 97 young people in custody and at times there 's 65 to 67 of those who are Aboriginal or Torres Strait Islander people and that is just not good enough , not acceptable , " he said .
To break the cycle of violence Mr Watson says effective rehabilitation has to start when offenders are young .
" Once these kids start committing offences and find that the world has noticed them , they find that in this macabre thinking of theirs that the only way they can have the world acknowledge their existence is by committing offences , being arrested and going into the criminal justice system , " he said .
" So these kids need to be convinced that that is not the right way , that there are better things to be doing than spending your entire life locked up behind bars . "
Russia .
100 Years Ago .
Again .
We had it from Russian photographer Prokudin - Gorsky
whose photos are being stored in the Library of Congress in USA , but now it ’s totally different
case .
Photos were made by Czech photographer while on his travel thru Russia back in the
year 1896 .
Most of them were lost later due to two wars in Europe and other tragical things but
some still managed to survive till our year 2009 and now we can see them here .
It ’s a big pity that there are only such a few of them left .
The previous posts on this you can see here and here , one of them boasts hundred plus photos .
Why do n't you just ask HIM ?
Anyway , I always thought that meant a flush to cover up the sound ??
So I do n't know what he means .
Hence why you should ask him to get the ' correct ' answer .
One idea is that he wants to know when you 're done , so he can get in .
A flush would alert him to when the bathroom is essentially free .. should he need it .
I guess since all the other answers are talking about a smell , I might be wrong .
But flushing quickly does n't get rid of a smell , and frankly why would someone announce via a premature flush , that they have just depositied something especially stinky ?
Yuck .
Plus you would need to be hanging around with your pants down if you got rid of it so quickly .
Does n't make any sense .

FRANKFURT ( Reuters ) - From major automakers to niche manufacturers , the race is on to get green cars on the road in the coming years , but one question lingers : after many false starts , are drivers finally ready for them ?
Emerging from a savage economic downturn and under increasing regulatory pressure to cut emissions , carmakers rushed to show off a plethora of green shoots at the Frankfurt Motor Show .
While manufacturers ’ estimates of the size of the market for the cars fluctuated , the need for government support in the early days was a recurring refrain .
France 's Renault RENA .
PA which unveiled four electric vehicle concepts previewing a new zero-emission product range , at the Frankfurt Auto Show , forecast ten percent of vehicles would be electric globally by 2020 .
" We think the potential is beyond but it 's going to depend not so much on the technology but on how governments , mayors , presidents and governors are willing to push this technology , " Renault Chief Executive Carlos Ghosn , who is also head of Nissan 7201 .
T said .
He said carmakers had little choice but to make the zero emissions shift , given the high probability that oil prices would go up , and emissions regulations would become tougher .
But the history of the industry ’s attempts to go green suggests that affordability is king , after all .
Hybrids , led by Toyota Motor Corp 's 7203 .
T top- selling Prius car , made up less than 2 percent of global sales last year , largely due to the high cost of batteries that leads to a price premium of nearly $ 5,000 over conventional vehicles .
Electric vehicles and plug - in hybrids are designed to go on battery power alone and are much more expensive than traditional hybrids , which twin battery power and internal combustion engines .
California start - up Tesla Motors ’ flagship Roadster sports car goes 240 miles on a single battery charge from a conventional power outlet but it sells for a base price of $ 109,000 .
The company is due to start production of its $ 49,000 “ Model S ” family sedan in late 2011 or 2012 .
Tesla ’s third generation car -- which will benefit from greater volumes and technological refinements -- could be priced below $ 30,000 , chief executive Elon Musk told Reuters .
The company intends to launch this new model in around five years ’ time .
“ It ’s intended to be a very mainstream car , ” Musk said .
GM ’s heavily - touted Chevrolet Volt plug - in hybrid , which is designed to go 40 miles on a single charge , is expected to be marketed at above $ 40,000 .
" At the end of the day , the question for us is what is the cost of the battery to the consumer , " Renault and Nissan 7201 .
T chief Ghosn said .
NO SINGLE APPROACH
PSA Peugeot Citroen expects around 1 in 20 cars sold worldwide to be electric by 2020 .
While the industry shares the common goal toward green technology , manufacturers have come up with differing solutions ranging from full electric , plug - in hybrid to efficient conventional powertrains , suggesting one standard solution is unlikely in the near term .
“ In the next 10 years I see a European market with many technologies living together .
I think it depends very much on the customer , but it will depend also on government and local authority decisions in terms of taxation and regulation , ” said Guillaume Gerondeau , Toyota Motor Europe ’s director of product planning and marketing .
An estimate endorsed by Ghosn that one in ten cars to be sold in 2020 would be electric is “ very optimistic ” given the challenge of cutting the costs of batteries , Gerondeau said .
" We do n't want to put all our eggs in one basket especially when we do n't know the size of the basket , " PSA Peugeot Citroen 's CEO Philippe Varin said at the show , referring to the electric vehicle segment .
" We are not cautious , but balanced . "
The French manufacturer unveiled its i On electric car , based on partner Mitsubishi Motors ' 7211 .
T iMiev and is also promoting hybrid technology .
“ There is no one fuel to replace gasoline .
Each automaker will have to identify which technology they will dedicate their resources to , ” said Takehi Uchiyamada , Toyota Motor Corp ’s executive vice president in charge of research and development .
“ There has to be a technological breakthrough for pure electric vehicles to penetrate the market .
We think plug - in hybrid is superior than pure electric vehicles , more practical , more reasonably priced , and close to reality . ”
Fisker Automotive Inc , a builder of luxury plug - in hybrids , showcased its first vehicle , a four - door luxury sedan plug - in hybrid called the Karma at the show .
“ With fully electric vehicles , consumers are afraid of possibly having to walk home when the batteries run out , ” Fisker told Reuters in an interview .
“ I ’m pretty confident that by 2030 that the majority of cars manufactured will be electric , ” Musk said .
“ Certainly by 2050 I would expect that 70 - 80 percent of the cars on the road are pure electric . ”
Maguire Properties Inc. , one of the region ’s largest commercial landlords , posted widening losses Monday and said it was about to default on seven prime office buildings in Los Angeles and Orange counties .
The real estate investment trust lost $ 375.7 million , or $ 7.95 a share , during the second quarter , more than twice the $ 105.9 million lost during the same period in 2008 .
It is defaulting on loans worth more than $ 1 billion .
Maguire Properties hopes that by giving back the keys to properties for which it overpaid at the peak of the last boom , it can reduce debt enough to keep the company solvent , Chief Executive Nelson Rising said in an interview Monday .

The huge second - quarter loss reported Monday was largely due to the decision to dispose of those properties , as the company posted a one - time write - down of $ 345 million .
Analysts interpreted the move as an anxious attempt to save the company , saying that if Maguire no longer has to make payments on the seven buildings , it might be able to hang on until the real estate market turns around .
Despite the bad news , the company ’s shares rose 15 cents to $ 1.04 as investors took hope that Maguire would be stronger going forward .
Craig Silvers , president of Bricks and Mortar Capital , said that by dumping some of its financially upside - down properties the company will burn less cash and may get through the real estate downturn .

“ It looks like they will survive , ” said Silvers , who bought Maguire stock on Monday .
But Michael Knott of Green Street Advisors called the company “ a zombie . . . with no intrinsic value . ”
“ They are not immediately headed for bankruptcy , ” Knott said .
“ But they are on life support and it ’s going to be hard for them to ever leave the ICU . ”
Rising said the dramatic move to cut loose prime office buildings did not mean that Chapter 11 was imminent .

“ We are not considering bankruptcy , ” he said .
“ We think this move will materially strengthen the company . ”
Maguire ’s decision to default on its loans is also a sign of worsening trouble in the commercial real estate market .
Properties continue to decline in value and more steep losses for landlords and lenders are coming , industry observers said .
As some brace for a wave of foreclosures like those that have engulfed the housing market , the pain could spread far enough to be a drag on the nation ’s economy .

“ We will certainly see further large - scale events like this , ” said investment banker Ryan Krauch , a principal at Mesa West Capital .
“ It gives everyone pause in the context of this recovering economy . ”
More companies , Krauch said , should write down the value of their buildings because that would enable them to set more realistic prices , helping to free up the frozen commercial real estate market .
Most of the buildings Maguire is giving up are in Orange County , where departed company founder Robert F. Maguire bet heavily in 2007 when he led a $ 3 - billion acquisition of 24 office buildings in Orange and Los Angeles counties .
Borrowing money for the heavily leveraged purchase was fairly easy at the time , when capital markets were still flush with cash .

The $ 3 - billion deal greatly expanded Maguire Properties ’ presence in Orange County , but the obligations turned into a financial millstone .
The hot Orange County market cooled dramatically , leaving Maguire and other landlords to struggle with high vacancy and falling rents .
Rising replaced Maguire as chief executive in May 2008 .
The Orange County buildings Maguire Properties will give up are Stadium Towers Plaza in Anaheim ; Park Place I and II in Irvine ; 2600 Michelson in Irvine ; Pacific Arts Plaza in Costa Mesa ; and 500 Orange Tower in Orange .
The company is expected to announce today that it has completed a deed - in - lieu - of - foreclosure sale of Park Place I , and has sold adjacent parking lots and development rights for $ 17 million .

Also on the list is 550 S. Hope St. , a 28 - story high - rise next to the Central Library in downtown Los Angeles .
The company acquired the property as part of the big 2007 deal .
Layton Belling & Associates of Irvine took title to Park Place I . Loans on the other properties are held by pools of investors who bought commercial mortgage - backed securities .
Maguire Properties is downtown L.A. 's largest office landlord and considers the city ’s financial district its primary market .
Other holdings there include U.S. Bank Tower , the tallest building in the West .
Monday ’s higher Wall Street price marked the first time Maguire stock closed above $ 1 since June 19 .
Shares had sold for $ 19 when the company went public in 2003 .

After the huge success of Starcraft and the large success of Warcraft 3 , Blizzard stepped off the RTS stage and let THQ nudge their way into the spotlight with Dawn of War and Company of Heroes .
But , despite their commercial and critical successes , neither franchise could hold a flame to Starcraft 's ability to produce and maintain competitive play at a high level .
Right now , Blizzard is probably asking the same question we 're about to investigate : what made Starcraft a huge competitive success while Dawn of War and Company of Heroes have a comparatively piddling competitive fan base ?
And are Dawn of War and Company of Heroes really an example of where the RTS genre is headed ?
The first , and largely underestimated , strength of Starcraft is its visual clarity .
In Starcraft , you can glance at the minimap and understand almost immediately where your forces are concentrated , or look at the screen and quickly understand the flow of the battle .
In Company of Heroes , however , the visual clarity gets lost amongst all the majestic effects that make the game so beautiful .
At first , this seems like a trivial difference .
However , visual clarity is crucial when making the split second decisions that can steal victory from looming defeat .
There are easily half a dozen times in any given Company of Heroes game where you must make a quick decision , usually about retreating , amidst huge clouds of smoke and severed limbs .
Looking back on the replay , you 'll often have made the wrong decision when , if the circumstances were clear , the decision would have been much easier .
Starcraft 's second strength is the precise level of control it gives the player .
Many casual RTS players see the gradual curtailment of micromanagement as a boon to the genre .
However , the more complex AI comes at the cost of precise control at a higher level of play .
As Starcraft evolved , competitive players tried to balance micromanagement with overall strategy and unit production , allowing them to hone a skill as well as push strategic innovations .
In Company of Heroes , however , the unit AI is complex and difficult to control manually .
When you try to run a unit back , or micromanage it around to flank , you 'll often find it moving slowly because it insists on running from cover to cover .
In buildings , even anti-armor units will often choose the wrong windows to fire from and get slaughtered by circling vehicles , which they could easily have killed if the player could simply tell them where to fire their rockets .
It 's also rather popular to praise Company of Heroes and Dawn of War for removing the micromanagement involved in resource gathering .
In Starcraft , however , one of the most interesting choices that defines the course of a game is when to expand and when not to expand , a choice that Company of Heroes and Dawn of War simply remove .
With the same stroke , Company of Heroes and Dawn of War also remove another layer of micromanagement ( worker micromanagement plays a large role in Starcraft ) and , consequently , another layer of skill .
Some might say , " Is n't that just purely physical skill ? "
Well , yes , but the balance between physical skill and strategic skill is part of any RTS - just as the balance between how quickly you can target someone 's head and tactical knowledge is part of any FPS .
If there were no micromanagement in real time strategy games then they 'd just be turn based strategy games , and we already have a genre for those .
But Company of Heroes ' largest weakness is its randomness .
Starcraft has very little randomness , and so the same ambush in the same place will almost always kill the same amount of units with the same amount of shots .
In Company of Heroes , sometimes it takes two rockets to take out a tank , sometimes the first four miss and it gets off unscathed .
Sometimes a grenade takes out an entire MG squad , sometimes it does n't kill anyone .
To most competitive players , this is unacceptable .
If the entire course of the game can be changed by a bad roll of the dice , there is no point in learning the subtleties of the game that competitive players use to get slight edges over each other .
In Starcraft , whether or not your dragoons are positioned in such a way that they get the optimal number of shots off is largely inconsequential in a game between low level players , but it 's crucial at the pro level .
However , almost everything in Company of Heroes has a random number generator attached to it .
This lends it a sense of realism and tension ( you never know what 's going to happen ! ) but severely limits high level play .
Among random number generators and confusing visual effects , the twin evolutions Company of Heroes and Dawn of War have proved another interesting , subtle point : there is such thing as AI that is too intelligent .
The more intelligent AI is , the less control the player has : when your units scatter and take cover at the sight of an artillery blast , they 'll scatter in unpredictable directions , and sometimes in ways you did n't mean for them to go at all ( like into a tank ) .
Moreover , the less control the player has over individual units , the less player skill factors into a result .
When an AI is dumb and predictable , the player knows exactly what will happen in any given situation and can use this knowledge to pull off difficult and impressive stunts .
However , when the AI becomes unpredictable and intelligent , the player loses that level of precise control over the game , making it a frustrating , slippery and often unintuitive mess , ironically the very thing that intelligent AI was supposed to safeguard against .
So where does THQ go from here ?
Both Company of Heroes and Dawn of War are innovative , intelligent RTSes .
Yet , as both games have evolved , it 's become clear that the elements that make them so cinematic - randomness , visual confusion , lack of precise control - are the same elements that make them unsuitable for high - level play .
The basic mechanics of reinforcement and capturing strategic points are interesting , but ultimately these RTSes need to turn their focus from cinema to gameplay if they want to become competitively successful .
In the long run , Company of Heroes and Dawn of War do n't support high level play in the same way that Starcraft does , even though they are often hailed as the pioneers in the RTS genre and true examples of a " modern RTS .
" Both Company of Heroes and Dawn of War are brilliant cinematic experiences and excellent single player games , but it 's going to take innovation in a completely different direction to compete with Starcraft 's competitive multiplayer juggernaut .
Britain is facing the tightest squeeze in public spending since the 1970s , after leaked Treasury documents showed a major deterioration in the nation 's public finances , the Institute for Fiscal Studies will warn tomorrow .
In a blow to Gordon Brown days after he relaunched his premiership by finally admitting that spending would have to be cut , the IFS will confirm
Tory warnings that the last budget in April failed to reveal the depth of the public finance crisis .
The IFS will release its latest commentary on Britain 's public finances in the wake of the leaking to the Tories of Treasury documents which showed that departmental spending would be cut by a total of 9.3 % between 2010 and 2014 .
David Cameron seized on the leak to question Brown 's honesty .
The prime minister told the Commons in June that the Tories were " ideologically committed to 10 % cuts in public services " which was " not the policy of this government " .
Cameron believes the leaked Treasury documents are particularly significant because key tables , marked " confidential " , are dated 21 April 2009 – the day before the budget .
The tables , the internal " live documents " used to compile the Red Book which illustrates budget projects , show departmental spending will have to be cut by 9.3 % between 2010 - 2014 .
Within two months of the budget , Brown launched a month - long attack on Cameron as a cutter in which the prime minister depicted the Tory leader as " Mr 10 % " – almost the same amount as the cuts outlined in the Treasury documents .
Downing Street said today that Brown had not misled parliament because no plans had been set out for public spending beyond 2010 - 11 .
The leaked documents show such deep cuts in departmental spending because the Treasury predicts a sharper than expected increase in two key costs of the recession – social security payments and debt interest payments – described by Brown in 2000 as the " costs of social and economic failure " .
The IFS embarked on a hasty revision of its forecasts today because the leaked documents provide a breakdown of projections for government spending up to 2014 ; at the time of the budget these detailed projections were only provided until 2012 .
Robert Chote , head of the IFS , said : " There has been something of a gap between the government 's rhetoric and its arithmetic over the period since the budget .
The prime minister came up with a variety of increasingly imaginative formulations over the summer to suggest spending would n't actually be falling . "
The IFS will underline the gravity of the public finances tomorrow when it warns that the unprecedented increase in spending over the last decade will have to be " completely reversed " by the next government – whoever wins the election – unless taxes are raised and welfare payments are cut .
Chote said : " The Treasury is expecting to pay a lot more in debt interest , social security payments and other things it does n't have much day - to - day control over .
We are looking to have to cut public spending by 3 % a year in real terms .
We have n't seen anything like that since the 1970s . "
But the IFS report will also place pressure on Cameron .
It shows that the Tories will have to cut departmental spending by 14 % from 2011 - 14 if they maintain their two spending commitments – to increase NHS spending in line with inflation and to meet the UN target of spending 0.7 % of GNI on overseas aid by 2013 .
Cameron , who last week pledged to increase public spending at a lower rate than Labour , today refused to rule out imposing cuts beyond the 9.3 % in the Treasury documents .
" If you start [ cutting ] earlier it is a less painful and better process because you want to start from a lower base , " he said .
The leak
What do the leaked Treasury documents reveal ?
The forecast on the eve of the last budget that departmental spending would be cut by 9.3 % in 2010 - 2014 .
Why such deep cuts ?
The breakdown of government spending until 2014 , not released at the time of the budget , shows a sharper than expected increase in social security and debt interest payments .
Will this lead to a revision of spending plans ?
Not for Labour which has not made any commitments after 2011 .
The Tories have two commitments : to increase NHS spending in line with inflation and to meet the UN target of spending of 0.7 % of GNI on overseas aid by 2013 .
The IFS , which had said this would mean cuts of 10 % in other areas , will say this will mean 14 % cuts .
Exercise bikes are dull .
Unless it is raining , there is no excuse not to just go outside on a real bike : it ’s both better exercise and way more fun .
There would be one exception .
Say you were playing a video - game so good you did n’t want to stop , but at the same time felt the need to get the blood pumping .
That would surely be the ideal time to use this stationary bike controller for the Wii and its companion game , Cyberbike .
Sadly , the game itself looks horrible , little more than an afterthought tagged on to justify buying a giant plastic bike to further clutter your home .
In it , according to the gamers at Kotaku , you save the planet , cleaning up pollution by flying your bike over things .
Wake me up when you ’re done .
The controller is at least compatible with Mario Kart .
Alternatively , go down to the basement and dig out the exercise bike you already have and sit on that while playing Mario Kart with a normal WiiMote .
The price of the Cyberbike has yet to be announced ahead of its 2010 launch , but you can be sure that it will be more than the zero dollars my solution will cost you .

Globally no one wants to own , invest or have anything to do with the once Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœmighty greenbackÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢. YesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s US TIC data revealed more Capital outflow from the country ( 15.5 b vs. 69.5 b , m / m ) .
Those numbers are for Aug.
Looking at June and July a mighty $ 150 b skipped town !
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s obvious that the constant Capital outflow is pressurizing the dollar , month end pricing in particular .
There seems to be a domestic appetite only for the currency , everyone else and their mother want to sell the Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœgreenbackÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ during North America time slots .
The confusing part to this whole scenario is , if there is such a migration out of the currency then why are US Bonds and Equities so bid ?
Inherently , the USD is weak and will get much weaker , itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s the delusions of other asset class bubble not happening is the concern !
The US $ is weaker in the O/N trading session .
Currently it is lower against 14 of the 16 most actively traded currencies in a Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœwhippyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ trading range .
YesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s US CPI print was larger than expected ( +0.4 % vs. +0.0 % ) , and followed a no change in July .
However , if we looked at ex-food and energy , the core - print increased +0.1 % , which was bang on expectations .
These numbers highlight the phenomena of gradual disinflation .
In reality , the lack of inflation will give the Fed and its policy makerÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s latitude to keep O/ N borrowing costs near to zero in the foreseeable future , until we at least see sustainable signs of recovery .
The Treasury departmentÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s announcement yesterday will surely pressurize the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœlack of inflationÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ theory .
They are to wind down most of its supplementary financing program , from approx $ 200 b to only $ 15 b .
The general consensus is that it will be done in a matter of weeks .
What exactly does this mean ?
The supplementary program consists of product that is 3 - months and less in maturity .
Technically , the maturing debt will not be rolled over .
The Fed will surely raise the level of excess reserves in the banking system by Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœprintingÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ up to $ 185 b of Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœnew moneyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ to offset the Treasury ’s action .
This should put upward pressure on inflation expectations and further downward pressure on the once Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœmighty buckÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢!
US Industrial Production managed to surge last month ( +0.8 % vs. +0.7 % ) , exceeding market expectations .
Both autos and utilities continue to lead the pack .
Digging deeper , the big - ticket durables production was up +0.5 % , but , ex-autos , durables production fell - 0.1 % after a +3.3 % rise the previous month .
Analysts commented that inventory positions outside of autos remain high and a sustained material ex-autos production rise is difficult to sustain until further inventory shedding occurs .
Inventories have been the scourge of this recession .
Non-durables production was up +0.7 % , led by higher food and drink output .
The meat of the data shows that motor vehicle and parts led the charge , rising + 5.5 % , m/ m , in Aug .
This is once again a solid gain after the Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœmiraculousÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ gain of +20.1 % in July .
Obviously , a disproportionate share of the rebound over the past two months can be attributed to autos .
However , itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s worth remembering that production of motor vehicles and parts remains - 20 % below its year - ago level !
This would suggest that current levels are not inflated .
Other data showed that US Capacity utilization posted its 2nd - consecutive gain last month .
The 69.6 % beat all expectations , especially after posting a record low of 68.3 % .
LetÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s not kid ourselves we have a long way to go before we can once again post the pre-recession rate levels .
Digging deeper , one notices that manufacturing , mining and utilities all posted an increase and the largest jump was in the motor vehicles sector .
That was not much of a surprise !
The USD $ is currently lower against the EUR +0.08 % , GBP +0.30 % , CHF +0.00 % and JPY +0.25 % .
The commodity currencies are stronger this morning , CAD +0.31 % and AUD +0.10 % .
The loonie managed to print new 6 - week highs in the O/N session as both global equities and commodities pushed the currency to dominate its southern neighbor .
When the USD is on the edge of a cliff looking into Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœchasm of nothingnessÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ it brings forth an appetite for risk which the loonie benefits from .
Canadian data showed yesterday that JulyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s factory sales advanced + 5.5 % vs. +2.4 % ( fastest gain in 12 - years ) , fuelled by autoÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s output jumping +48 % !
Any sustainable signs of Canadian growth and no BOC interference will have the loonie trading at a premium vs. the buck sooner than we think .
Dealers continue to play the range and will take their cue from commodities and equities .
The AUD has once again surged to New Year highs on the back of US reports showing that they fundamentals are stronger , thus boosting the demand for higher - yielding assets .
With commodity prices moving upwards hand - in - hand with Asian bourses has encouraged Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœnewÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ risk appetite , which should provide further support for the AUD .
CommodityÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s account for +50 % of the country Ã¢â‚¬â „ ¢s exports .
Dealers are looking to buy the currency on pullbacks ( 0.8743 ) .
Crude is lower in the O/N session ( $ 72.50 down - 1 c ) .
YesterdayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s weekly EIA report favored higher crude prices .
Mind you the weak dollar continues to provide never ending support .
US oil stockpiles fell much more than expected last week as imports continued to decrease while inventories of refined fuels increased .
Crude inventories fell by - 4.7 m barrels w/w to +332.8 m , beating analysts ’ forecasts of a drop of - 2.4 m .
Imports fell - 192 k barrels per day .
ItÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s worth noting that refiners cut crude runs by - 56 k bpd as refinery utilization was off - 0.3 % to 86.9 % of capacity .
The market was anticipating a - 0.5 % fall .
Inventories of distillates fuels ( heating oil and diesel ) were up + 2.2 m barrels at +167.8 m , vs. forecasts for a rise of only + 1.3 m .
On the flip side , gas supplies increased +500 k barrels to +207.7 m , w/w .
The data would have included the Labor Day holiday , which historically marks the end of the US summer driving season .
Earlier this week , the API report painted a slightly different picture .
Crude stocks gained +631 k barrels last week as refiners slowed run rates by - 146 k bpd .
Inventories of distillates rose + 5.2 m barrels and gas inventories were up by + 1.3 m barrels .
Stronger US fundamental and Governor BernankeÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s belief that worst of the recession is over will provide further support on pull backs in the short term .
Last week , we were subjected to the Ã¢â‚ ¬ ËœweakÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ dollar boosting the appeal of commodities to investors as an inflation hedge , this week we continue to witness a Ã¢â‚ ¬ËœsicklyÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ greenback .
Currently there is nothing to dissuade investors from this conviction .
Least we forget , demand destruction remains healthy no matter what the USD is doing !
Last week the Ã¢â‚ ¬Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢ surged to its highest close in 18 - months on the back of a weak dollar scenario .
This week the picture remains the same with the Ã¢â‚ ¬ Ëœyellow metalÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢
O/N well sought after , as investors buy the commodity as a hedge against inflation ( $ 1,022 ) .
The Nikkei closed at 10,443 up +173 .
The DAX index in Europe was at 5,723 up + 23 ; the FTSE ( UK ) currently is 5,161 up +38 .
The early call for the open of key US indices is higher .
The 10 - year bonds backed up 2 bp yesterday ( 3.46 % ) and are little changed in the O/N session .
Yesterday , Treasures managed to stay close to home and were little changed by dayÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s end .
A stronger than expected industrial production report coupled with a CPI print showing that inflation remains well contained managed to pare the early advances for Treasuries to basically unchanged .
The less bad scenario means itÃ¢â‚¬â „ ¢s good !
PIMCO let it be known that they hold a considerable amount of Government debt and continue to add to it .
Basically Bill Gross is talking his portfolio .

The pace of human evolution has been increasing at a stunning rate since our ancestors began spreading through Europe , Asia and Africa 40,000 years ago , quickening to 100 times historical levels after agriculture became widespread , according to a study published today .
By examining more than 3 million variants of DNA in 269 people , researchers identified about 1,800 genes that have been widely adopted in relatively recent times because they offer some evolutionary benefit .
Until recently , anthropologists believed that evolutionary pressure on humans eased after the transition to a more stable agrarian lifestyle .
But in the last few years , they realized the opposite was true -- diseases swept through societies in which large groups lived in close quarters for a long time .
Altogether , the recent genetic changes account for 7 % of the human genome , according to the study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
Advertisement
The advantage of all but about 100 of the genes remains a mystery , said University of Wisconsin - Madison anthropologist John Hawks , who led the study .
But the research team was able to conclude that infectious diseases and the introduction of new foods were the primary reasons that some genes swept through populations with such speed .
“ If there were not a mismatch between the population and the environment , there would n’t be any selection , ” Hawks said .
“ Dietary changes , disease changes -- those create circumstances where selection can happen . ”
One of the most famous examples is the spread of a gene that allows adults to digest milk .
Though children were able to drink milk , they typically developed lactose intolerance as they grew up .
But after cattle and goats were domesticated in Europe and yaks and mares were domesticated in Asia , adults with a mutation that allowed them to digest milk had a nutritional advantage over those without .
Advertisement
As a result , they were more likely to have healthy offspring , prompting the mutation to spread , Hawks said .
The mechanism also explains why genetic resistance to malaria has spread among Africans -- who live where disease - carrying mosquitoes are prevalent -- but not among Europeans or Asians .
Most of the genetic changes the researchers identified were found in only one geographic group or another .
Races as we know them today did n’t exist until fewer than 20,000 years ago , when genes involved in skin pigmentation emerged , Hawks said .
Paler skin allowed people in northern latitudes to absorb more sunlight to make vitamin D .
“ As populations expanded into new environments , the pressures faced in those environments would have been different , ” said Noah Rosenberg , a human geneticist at the University of Michigan , who was n’t involved in the study .
“ So it stands to reason that in different parts of the world , different genes will appear to have experienced natural selection . ”

Hawks and colleagues from UC Irvine , the University of Utah and Santa Clara - based gene chip maker Affymetrix Inc. examined genetic data collected by the International HapMap Consortium , which cataloged single - letter differences among the 3 billion letters of human DNA in people of Nigerian , Japanese , Chinese and European descent .
The researchers looked for long stretches of DNA that were identical in many people , suggesting that a gene was widely adopted and that it spread relatively recently , before random mutations among individuals had a chance to occur .
They found that the more the population grew , the faster human genes evolved .
That ’s because more people created more opportunities for a beneficial mutation to arise , Hawks said .
In the last 5,000 to 10,000 years , as agriculture was able to support increasingly large societies , the rate of evolutionary change rose to more than 100 times historical levels , the study concluded .
Advertisement
Among the fastest - evolving genes were those related to brain development , but the researchers are n’t sure what made them so desirable , Hawks said .
There are other mysteries too .
“ Nobody 10,000 years ago had blue eyes , ” Hawks said .
“ Why is it that blue - eyed people had a 5 % advantage in reproducing compared to non -blue - eyed people ?
I have no idea . ”

X - 30 , aka National Aerospace Plane ( NASP ) ; 1986 – 1993 ; $ 2 + billion ( much of it from the US military rather than NASA ) .
A very ambitious project , meant to use advanced air - breathing engines to take off from a runway and fly directly into orbit ( or fly long distances within the atmosphere at extremely high speed ) .
It was eventually cancelled due to persistent technical problems and skyrocketing cost estimates .
There was no replacement , although some of the technology work was continued by small research programmes , including the X - 43 , a hypersonic aircraft project that smashed the world record for aircraft speed in 2004 when an air - breathing plane flew briefly at nearly 10 times the speed of sound .
( Illustration : NASA - LaRC )
Advanced Solid Rocket Motor ( ASRM ) ; 1986 – 1993 ; $ 2.2 billion .
After the Challenger shuttle accident in 1986 , NASA launched a project to replace the shuttle 's solid rocket boosters – which had been the cause of the failure .
The improved design was intended to be safer and somewhat more powerful , and would also be built in a government - owned factory so NASA would n't be at the mercy of a single contractor .
With work progressing and the factory mostly completed , Congress refused further funding due to spiralling costs and a slipping schedule .
ASRM's one crucial function – increasing the shuttle 's lifting capacity in order to launch heavy space - station modules – was taken over by a lighter shuttle external fuel tank made of an aluminium - lithium alloy .
In this image , a small , 1.2 - metre solid rocket motor tests design features for the ASRM at a NASA facility in 1991 .
( Image : NASA - MSFC )
Shuttle - C ; 1987 – 1990 ; perhaps $ 200 million .
An unmanned cargo derivative of the shuttle , Shuttle - C was designed to replace the shuttle orbiter with a cargo pod atop an engine module .
It was intended to carry heavier loads than the shuttle and perhaps hazardous ones ( like liquid - fuel upper stages ) .
There had been many earlier design studies , some with the same name , for shuttle - derived cargo vehicles .
For a few years after the Challenger accident , NASA pursued work on the Shuttle - C project , with the initial aim of launching heavy space - station modules .
But rising cost estimates for development and dwindling hopes for launch - cost savings gradually made the project look less worthwhile .
Funding was zeroed out by Congress to help pay for the massive cost overruns of the space station .
( Illustration : NASA - MSFC ) Advertisement
National Launch System ( NLS ) ; 1989 – 1993 ; perhaps $ 300 million .
This was a joint NASA - US Air Force project for a low - cost shuttle - derived expendable launcher to replace existing expendable rockets , such as Atlas , Delta and Titan launchers .
Congress cut its funding due to problems with cost and schedule , a hopelessly confused management structure , and the lack of a clear requirement for the system , since there was nothing obviously wrong with existing launchers and Congress was sceptical that the NLS would be significantly cheaper .
After some fumbling , the US Air Force replaced it with the Evolved Expendable Launch Vehicle ( EELV ) programme that produced the Delta IV and Atlas V rockets .
( The RS - 68 engine that powers the Delta IV is probably derived from work on the " Space Transportation Main Engine " for the National Launch System . )
In this image , a National Launch System engine is test - fired at a NASA centre .
( Image : NASA - MSFC )
X - 34 ; 1994 – 1996 , $ 8 million ; and 1996 – 2001 , $ 60 million .
The X - 34 was originally a joint project between NASA and the aerospace firms Orbital Sciences and Rockwell .
It was designed as a two - stage launcher for small satellites , with the first stage being reusable .
Orbital and Rockwell withdrew less than a year after the contract was signed , because they decided the project could not be done for the promised amount .
( A major disagreement between Rockwell and NASA over engine choice likely contributed to the decision . )
The X - 34 was reborn as a programme for a suborbital reusable - rocket technology demonstrator ( illustrated ) .
But when the first flight vehicle was near completion , the programme died after NASA demanded sizable design changes without providing any new funding , and the contractor , Orbital Sciences , refused .
( Illustration : NASA - MSFC )
X - 38 ; 1995 – 2002 ; perhaps $ 100 million .
Meant primarily as a " lifeboat " for the space station , the X - 38 was a wingless vehicle whose body shape was designed to provide some lift , giving it the ability to do controlled gliding flights and to be guided to a desired point before its parachute was deployed for landing .
It was developed in - house at NASA 's Johnson Space Center , with some later European involvement , but was cancelled as part of space - station revisions provoked by station cost overruns .
It was replaced by the EELV - launched Orbital Space Plane ( OSP ) , which eventually merged into the Constellation programme currently planned to replace the space shuttle .
In this image , a prototype of the X - 38 crew lifeboat drops away from a plane during a 13 - minute test flight in late 2001 .
( Image : NASA - DFRC )
X - 33 ; 1996 – 2001 ; $ 912 million ( NASA share ) .
The X - 33 was a NASA - Lockheed Martin suborbital technology demonstrator for a reusable rocket that would reach orbit without using multiple stages or dropping fuel tanks .
It was intended to be followed by a commercial " single- stage -to- orbit " ( SSTO ) vehicle , VentureStar .
But the X - 33 was cancelled due to slipping schedules and performance , rising costs that Lockheed Martin was unwilling to absorb , and a major failure during a test of its composite - material tanks .
There was no replacement ; NASA has taken the failure of the X - 33 as proof that SSTO is not a credible concept .

Despite a projected tripling of traffic in China over the next decade , the focus should be on low - carbon technology rather than sacrifice , says a report by Tony Blair 's Climate Group
Car ownership cannot be sacrificed in the fight against climate change , Tony Blair said today in Beijing , despite a projected tripling of traffic in China over the next decade .
In a report forecasting 150 m cars on China 's roads , which will produce a fifth of global exhaust emissions by 2020 , the former UK prime minister said it was impractical to expect governments to curb sales .
" I think the way we consume has to change , but I think it is completely unrealistic to say to people you can't have a car , you can't use a motorbike .
It is just not going to happen , " he said .
Instead , he said , the focus should be on developing low - carbon technology and expanding the manufacturing and infrastructure for hybrid and electric vehicles .
He was talking at the launch of a new report by his Climate Group , which suggests the world 's most populous nation is taking the lead in many fields of low - carbon industry .
While many environmentalists stress the need to curb consumption worldwide to deal with global warming , Blair emphasised change rather than sacrifice .
" We are changing the way we live not so that we do n't consume and get the material benefits that people like ourselves actually enjoy , but we are changing it so that we do so in a way that is sustainable , " he said .
Asking developing nations not to follow suit , he said , was unrealistic .
" If you were to say to people in China that we in the west have grown our economies and consumed all this , but you must live in poverty for the sake of the planet , then they are going to say ' No , I am not ' , " he said .
The reluctance of politicians to consider curbs to economic growth or freedom of movement was also evident the previous day in comments by Lord Adonis , the UK transport secretary .
" We 'll never sell a low - carbon future to the public if it depends on a deprivation model .
I 'm convinced that there 's no necessary trade - off between a low - carbon future and more or less transport , " Adonis noted during a visit to Beijing to share information on high - speed rail and " clean car " development .
" We do n't need to have a hair shirt approach , " he said .
" If you can radically cut emissions as a result of new transport technology it is not necessary to face people with an either - or choice between a low - carbon future and big cuts in travel . "
Adonis said he had recently read The Politics of Climate Change by Prof Anthony Giddens , a key adviser during the Blair premiership , who writes about the difficulty leaders face in selling climate sacrifices to voters .
Climate change experts urged politicians to be bolder .
" To suggest that we can solve everything with technology is unrealistic , " said Jim Watson of the Tyndall Centre .
" Blair is right that consumer habits have to change , but we should not rule out a reconsideration of the ever greater access to transport . "
This is currently more true of Britain than China .
Transport in the UK accounts for about 23 % of the UK 's emissions , having risen steadily over past decade .
In China , it accounts for only 8 % , but is set to increase rapidly , according to the Tyndale centre .
High on the agenda of both politicians was the upcoming climate talks in Copenhagen , where China will play a make - or - break role .
Beijing has taken impressive steps to reduce energy intensity , but its carbon savings are far outstripped by the rapid growth of such a large economy .
Earlier this week , a senior advisory body noted that China 's emissions could peak in 2030 but even this most optimistic scenario would fail to prevent dangerous levels of global warming .
The government has yet to make a commitment .
Blair said the sooner the peak comes the better , but he was cautious about setting targets .
" If we get an agreement at the end of this year that sets the world on a new path , without us getting obsessed by precise percentages in each areas , then I think we will find that progress in science and technology accelerates and develops in ways that we probably can't predict now at all . "
Once the direction is set , he predicted the peak would come more quickly than people expect .
Stolen Car
Car thievery is something that has long been a problem .
However statistically speaking there are cars that are thought to be more likely to be stolen and those cars that are less likely to be stolen .
Auto theft has been climbing in recent years .
There are many reasons that this is the case .
One reason is that in a poor economy the rate at which stolen cars are available for parts sales or to be able to sell on the black market seems to be more marketable .
By being more marketable there are issues that are concerned with the theft of automobiles .
Recent reports claim that there has been up to a ten percent increase in recent years of cars .
There are a number of different reasons that the top ten vehicles are the top ten .
Some of them have to do with the vehicles being popular or more of them being on the road while others have to do with the value of the vehicle on the black market .
10 . The Ford F150 is the tenth most common car that is stolen in the United States .
This car can be looked at for theft for a number of reasons .
One is that there are so many of these on the road that they are harder to find .
Another is that these have been the best selling trucks for the past twenty five years and their popularity makes them possible for making them looked as something that one might want to steal .

9 . The Chevrolet Caprice is another commonly stolen vehicle .
This is because there are a number of things that make the car attractive to thieves .
One is that these cars are quite common and it makes identification harder .
Further this car is often targeted by theft rings as those in other countries will pay handsomely for these stolen cars .
Some of the theft rings even lead the seller to take the car to one of the following areas like Poland , Russia , and Eastern bloc countries .

8 . The Ford Taurus is another commonly stolen car .
There are a number of reasons for this however the most common reasons are that there are a number of cars stolen on a daily basis and due to the popularity of the Ford Taurus each day a number of these thefts could be of Taurus .

7. Toyota Corollas are commonly stolen cars for a number of reasons .
One of the reasons is that these cars are easy to steal from a number of areas like curbside , at the airport , parking lots , and even home driveways .
Since these cars are popular to steal there are a number of things that one can do to be able to prevent the theft of their Corolla .

6 . The next type of car to be stolen is the Chevrolet Full Size C/K Pick up .
These vehicles are popular to thieves for a number of reasons .
One reason that these trucks are stolen is because of the way that they look .
Another reason is that they are often stick shift and stick shift vehicles are more attractive to thieves as they often do not have the same type of alarm systems as automatic vehicles .
5 . The fifth most common stolen vehicle is the Jeep Cherokee or the Jeep Grand Cherokee .
This is because sport utility vehicles are in high demand and those who have been interested in these things are intent on finding vehicles that they can easily unload and sell for a quick profit .

4. The Oldsmobile Cutlass is another commonly stolen vehicle .
This car finds itself among the top stolen vehicles for a number of reasons .
For one is a very common vehicle and since there are many on the road there is a higher chance of them being targets .
Further the car is very easy to steal .
It is easy to be able to break the locks and bypass the ignition .
By doing a quick internet search on how to steal a car you can find out how to steal an Oldsmobile Cutlass .
Basically you get told that all it takes it to put a flat screwdriver in the keyhole and hammer it in and then turn it hard in order to break the lock .

3 . The Honda Civic is another commonly stolen vehicle .
This car seems to be the one that is available for a number of things to be considered .
These cars are worth $ 30,000 in parts that can be sold on the black market even though the car is only worth $ 20,000 .
So this is a car that is mainly stolen for parts and then the cars are stripped and the parts are sold individually .

2 . The Honda Accord is the second most commonly stolen vehicle in the United States .
There are a number of factors that affect why these cars are often stolen .
There are so many different reasons for which these things are considered .
There is a big market for these cars as there are a number of reasons both young and old alike enjoy .
Since these vehicles have an easy to pass ignition which makes them easier to steal .
Also there are a number of different areas in which one is able to add a larger engine and be able to control things .

1. The Toyota Camry is the number one most stolen car in America .
Perhaps this is because of the popularity and the fact that there are so many different Camrys on the road now .
There are also a number of different types of vehicles that are considered .
This car has been on the top stolen list for some years and there are a number of reasons for this .
However the most common years of models to be stolen are 1999 , 1989 , and 1990 .

Having a vehicle stolen is one of the worst things that one can have happen to them .
There are a number of reasons that this is the case and there are even those who choose what types of cars they purchase based on these types of lists .
One of the most famous quotes in sports history is linked to the date September 28 , 1920 .
On that day , “ Shoeless Joe ” Jackson supposedly admitted during testimony to a grand jury that he was one of eight Chicago White Sox baseball players who took bribes to let the Cincinnati Reds win the 1919 World Series .
It came to be known as the “ Black Sox scandal ” and it was devastating for baseball fans .
A crowd of fans were gathered outside the Cook County Courthouse where Jackson was testifying .
Word spread among them that their hero had admitted he ’d helped throw the series to the Reds .
According to legend , as Jackson left the courthouse , a heartbroken young boy went up to him and begged : “ Say it ai n’t so , Joe . ”
It ’s legend rather than fact because there are holes in key aspects of the story .
For one thing , there ’s no court record of Jackson ever admitting he was involved in fixing the game — and , publicly , he always denied it .
In 1921 , Jackson was found innocent by a Chicago jury .
In addition , o ther players who admitted to being on the take said Jackson was not at any of the meetings they had with the gamblers involved .
What about the tear - jerking line by the crushed kid ?
Quotation experts have determined the legendary quote is a misquote of a quote that was probably fabricated by a reporter in the first place .
One of the best overviews of the facts is in Ralph Keyes ’ must - have quote debunking book , Nice Guys Finish Seventh : False Phrases , Spurious Sayings , and Familiar Misquotations .
As noted by Keyes , an Associated Press sportswriter named Hugh Fullerton was at the courthouse when Shoeless Joe left it that day .
In the original version of the story he filed , Fullerton wrote that a young kid approached Jackson as he emerged and said : “ It ai n’t so , Joe , is it ? ”
Fullerton wrote that Jackson replied “ Yes , kid , I ’m afraid it is . ”
Somehow , by 1940 , the words “ It ai n’t so , Joe , is it ? ” morphed into “ Say it ai n’t so , Joe ” in rewritten accounts of the incident .
Then it became legend .
Eventually , it became an idiomatic expression used humorously as a comment about some disappointing revelation or bad news .
However , no other eyewitness accounts corroborate either version of the alleged quotation by the young baseball fan .
Jackson himself always denied any such thing was said to him by a kid or anyone else that day .
So , basically , the quote and story were apparently made up by a reporter — and then further distorted in later accounts .
In recent decades , public awareness of the “ Black Sox Scandal ” and “ Shoeless Joe ” Jackson has been renewed by various books and movies , most notably by two best - selling books that were adapted into hit movies : Eight Men Out and Field of Dreams .

Three separate bombings in northwest Pakistan have left 24 dead as militants counterattack the government 's major anti-Taliban offensive close to the Afghan border .
A Pakistani police officer stands guard as others examine the site after a bomb explosion at a recreational facility in Peshawar , Pakistan on Friday , Oct. 23 , 2009 .
It was one of three major militant attacks on Friday .
( ( Mohammad Sajjad / Associated Press ) )
Early Friday , a suicide bomber struck near a major air force complex in northwestern Pakistan , killing seven people .
A lone suicide bomber on a bicycle blew himself up at a checkpoint on a road leading to the complex , around 50 kilometres from the capital .
Police officer Akbar Abbas blamed the Taliban for the attack .
The seven dead included two security troops , while 13 people were wounded .
The complex at Kamra or its workers have been targeted at least once before .
In December 2007 , a suicide car bomber struck near a bus carrying children of Pakistan air force employees , wounding five .
Later , an explosion ripped through a bus headed to a wedding in a northwest Pakistani tribal area .
Seventeen people were killed in that blast , including women and children .
Local official Zabit Khan says the exact cause of the blast Friday was not immediately certain , but that it could have been a remote - controlled bomb .
Mohmand , like other parts of Pakistan 's tribal belt , has been a magnet for Taliban militants .
The military has carried out operations there in the past aimed at clearing out insurgents but trouble still flares .
Also Friday , a car bomb exploded in the parking lot of a recreational facility in Peshawar , the main city in the northwest .
Fifteen people were wounded .
The facility includes a restaurant , a swimming pool , a health club and a marriage hall .
" It is part of the violence we are seeing across Pakistan these days , " said Mian Iftikhar Hussain , the region 's information minister .
There have been at least nine major militant attacks this month , most against police or army targets .
Violence escalating
The attacks by suspected militants were the latest in a wave of bombings and raids sweeping Pakistan , targeting mostly security - related institutions and killing more than 170 people .
The Pakistan Aeronautical Complex at Kamra is the country 's main air force maintenance and research hub .
Some foreign military experts have mentioned it as a possible place to keep planes that can carry nuclear warheads .
The army , which does not reveal where its nuclear - related facilities are , has denied that the facility is tied to the program in any way .
Pakistan is under intense pressure to eliminate Islamist militant groups sheltering in its northwest that also attack U.S. and NATO troops in Afghanistan .
The military has battled them in various districts , losing hundreds of soldiers , but questions remain about its overall strategic commitment to the fight .
It began its current offensive in South Waziristan seven days ago .
The army has previously moved into South Waziristan three times since 2004 .
Each time it has suffered high casualties and signed peace deals that left insurgents with effective control of the region .
Western officials say al - Qaeda now uses it and neighbouring North Waziristan as an operations and training base .
WASHINGTON --
The biggest recipients so far of the federal contracts awarded with stimulus money are large companies that faced little competition for the funds .
Most of the money that has flowed from the $ 787 billion stimulus plan since it was passed six months ago has gone to the states .
But about 22,000 federal contracts with a total value of around $ 12 billion have been signed with companies , according to a public database of the deals .
Companies faced no competition in about a fifth of the dollars and almost all of the contracts agreed to so far have had four bidders or fewer , the records show .
The reported contracts include millions of dollars for big - name food , drug and auto companies .
Del Monte Foods Co. and Hormel Food Corp.'s Jennie - O
Turkey unit are providing supplies for food pantries , and so are private - label firms such as Lakeside Foods .
Drug makers GlaxoSmithKline PLC , Merck & Co. , Novartis AG and a unit of Sanofi Aventis Group are supplying extra vaccines for the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Chrysler Group LLC , Ford Motor Co. and General Motors Co. are selling hybrids and other fuel - efficient vehicles to the General Services Administration for the federal fleet .
The database also includes details of goods and services , from tree - thinning and cables to uniforms and advertising .
About a fifth of the contracts were awarded to small vendors , according to the Small Business Administration .
The single biggest chunk of the money going to companies -- about $ 4 billion -- has been doled out to speed cleanup at Cold War -era nuclear sites .
The money has flowed to those companies quickly , in part because the Department of Energy was already working with them on the projects .
Here 's a refreshingly simple idea :
" There are 52 solid Democrats for the public option , " said Senator Tom Harkin , the Iowa Democrat who is chairman of the health committee .
" Only about five Democrats oppose it .
Should the 52 give in to the five ?
Or should the five go along with the vast majority of the Democratic caucus ? "
But if they do that , their egos go unflattered and without stroking .
If Ben Nelson or Joe Lieberman give in now , Olympia Snowe is going to get all the attention .
Absolutely , majority should rule .
Every Democratic and Connecticut for Lieberman member should be willing to take this one for the team and agree that they will not be a part of the filibuster that will kill reform .
Because , as David W. has pointed out , a " Republican " filibuster is only happening if a Dem defects .
( Someone should remind Harry Reid of that , too , as he 's still pushing the Republican filibuster myth in this NYT , " Mr. Reid , similarly , said that he was focused on devising a bill that could win the 60 votes needed to overcome a likely Republican filibuster and could not yet turn to any task beyond that . " )
Of course , those 52 Dems could take a lesson from House Progressives , who recognized early on that they could make good use of Republican obstructionism and leverage it to make reform stronger with the credible threat of voting no with the Republicans if the bill is n't good enough .
The fight does n't have to be over cloture .
They can be good team members on that one , and have their up or down vote on reform , and pledge to vote a bad bill down .
It 's a high stakes game , and even higher in the Senate than in the House , but it would only take a dozen Senators to do it .
If there 's any issues that 's worth extraordinary measure , and worth doing right , it 's this one .

For years , many educators have championed “ errorless learning , " advising teachers ( and students ) to create study conditions that do not permit errors .
For example , a classroom teacher might drill students repeatedly on the same multiplication problem , with very little delay between the first and second presentations of the problem , ensuring that the student gets the answer correct each time .
The idea embedded in this approach is that if students make errors , they will learn the errors and be prevented ( or slowed ) in learning the correct information .
But research by Nate Kornell , Matthew Hays and Robert Bjork at U.C.L.A. that recently appeared in the Journal of Experimental Psychology : Learning , Memory and Cognition reveals that this worry is misplaced .
In fact , they found , learning becomes better if conditions are arranged so that students make errors .
People remember things better , longer , if they are given very challenging tests on the material , tests at which they are bound to fail .
In a series of experiments , they showed that if students make an unsuccessful attempt to retrieve information before receiving an answer , they remember the information better than in a control condition in which they simply study the information .
Trying and failing to retrieve the answer is actually helpful to learning .
It ’s an idea that has obvious applications for education , but could be useful for anyone who is trying to learn new material of any kind .
In one of their experiments , students were required to learn pairs of “ weak associates , ” words that are loosely related such as star - night or factory - plant .
( If students are given the first word and asked to generate an associate , the probability of generating the target word is only 5 percent . )
In the pretest condition , students were given the first word of the pair ( star- ??? ) and told to try to generate the second member that they would have to later remember .
They had 8 seconds to do so .
Of course , almost by definition , they nearly always failed to generate the correct answer .
They might generate bright in the case of star - ???.
At that point they were given the target pair ( star–night ) for 5 seconds .
In the control condition , students were given the pair to study for 13 seconds , so in both conditions there were a total of 13 seconds of study time for the pair .
The team found that students remembered the pairs much better when they first tried to retrieve the answer before it was shown to them .
In a way this pretesting effect is counterintuitive : Studying a pair for 13 seconds produces worse recall than studying the pair for 5 seconds , if students in the latter condition spent the previous 8 seconds trying to retrieve or guess the answer .
But the effect averaged about 10 percent better recall , and occurred both immediately after study and after a delay averaging 38 hours .
Some readers may look askance at the use of word pairs , even though it is a favorite tactic of psychologists .
In another article , in the Journal of Experimental Psychology : Applied , Lindsey Richland , Nate Kornell and Liche Kao asked the same question , but they used more educationally relevant text material ( an essay on vision ) .
Students were asked to read the essay and prepare for a test on it .
However , in the pretest condition they were asked questions about the passage before reading it such as “ What is total color blindness caused by brain damage called ? ”
Asking these kinds of question before reading the passage obviously focuses students ’ attention on the critical concepts .
To control this “ direction of attention ” issue , in the control condition students were either given additional time to study , or the researchers focused their attention on the critical passages in one of several ways : by italicizing the critical section , by bolding the key term that would be tested , or by a combination of strategies .
However , in all the experiments they found an advantage in having students first guess the answers .
The effect was about the same magnitude , around 10 percent , as in the previous set of experiments .
This work has implications beyond the classroom .
By challenging ourselves to retrieve or generate answers we can improve our recall .
Keep that in mind next time you turn to Google for an answer , and give yourself a little more time to come up with the answer on your own .
Students might consider taking the questions in the back of the textbook chapter and try to answer them before reading the chapter .
( If there are no questions , convert the section headings to questions .
If the heading is Pavlovian Conditioning , ask yourself What is Pavlovian conditioning ? ) .
Then read the chapter and answer the questions while reading it .
When the chapter is finished , go back to the questions and try answering them again .
For any you miss , restudy that section of the chapter .
Then wait a few days and try to answer the questions again ( restudying when you need to ) .
Keep this practice up on all the chapters you read before the exam and you will be have learned the material in a durable manner and be able to retrieve it long after you have left the course .
Of course , these are general - purpose strategies and work for any type of material , not just textbooks .
And remember , even if you get the questions wrong as you self - test yourself during study the process is still useful , indeed much more useful than just studying .
Getting the answer wrong is a great way to learn .

Mr. Edwards dismissed an initial report in The National Enquirer in 2007 that he was having an affair , and the matter was largely ignored by the mainstream news media .
But in July 2008 , The Enquirer published an article with photographs of a clandestine meeting Mr. Edwards had with Ms. Hunter and her daughter in a Los Angeles hotel .
Days later , Mr. Edwards acknowledged the affair to “ Nightline ” on ABC , offering contrition but insisting that the child could not be his because of the timing and brevity of their intimacy .
Wade M. Smith , a Raleigh lawyer who represents Mr. Edwards , declined to comment on the paternity issue directly , but said in a statement that “ there may be a statement on that subject at some point , but there is no timetable and we will see how we feel about it as events unfold . ”
The notion that Mr. Edwards is the father has been reinforced by the account of Andrew Young , once a close aide to Mr. Edwards , who had initially asserted that he was the father of Ms. Hunter ’s child .
Mr. Young , who has since renounced that statement , has told publishers in a book proposal that Mr. Edwards knew all along that he was the child ’s father .
He said Mr. Edwards pleaded with him to accept responsibility falsely , saying that would reduce the story to one of an aide ’s infidelity .
In the proposal , which The New York Times examined , Mr. Young says that he assisted the affair by setting up private meetings between Mr. Edwards and Ms. Hunter .
He wrote that Mr. Edwards once calmed an anxious Ms. Hunter by promising her that after his wife died , he would marry her in a rooftop ceremony in New York with an appearance by the Dave Matthews Band .

If you insist on using chemical laden insect repellents containing DEET , you may be getting more than you bargained for -- including damage to your central nervous system .
In fact , scientists writing in the open access journaldo n't just say that more studies should be done to confirm DEET 's potential neurotoxicity to humans .
The researchers are calling for more investigations of the chemical to be conducted on anbasis .
The reason ?
They suspect that the potential brain cell damaging effects of DEET could be particularly harmful if used in combination with other neurotoxic insecticides .
And that 's exactly the way DEET is normally used in products applied to both adults and kids in order to prevent mosquito bites .
French scientists Vincent Corbel from the Institut de Recherche pour le Developement in Montpellier and Bruno Lapied from the University of Angers headed a team of researchers who studied the mode of action and toxicity of DEET , also known by the chemical name .
" We 've found that DEET is not simply a behavior - modifying chemical but also inhibits the activity of a key central nervous system enzyme , acetycholinesterase , in both insects and mammals , " Corbel said in a statement to the media .
DEET has been in use since its discover in l953 and is now the most common ingredient found in insect repellent preparations .
It is primarily hyped as a way to keep mosquitoes at bay and doctors and insect repellant manufacturers promote DEET 's use through scare tactics , suggesting you are likely to get West Nile fever from mosquito bites unless you use the chemical
Of course , not every mosquito bite spreads any kind of infection and West Nile fever is not always serious .
What 's more , a host of natural strategies , from wearing long sleeves and pants in areas plagued by mosquitoes to using a variety of herbal extracts and essential oils topically , can help you avoid bug bites and stings without chemicals .
Yet DEET remains promoted by the mainstream media and medical establishment asingredient that protects adequately against mosquito bites and disease .
Consider this worrisome statistic : each year approximately .
And this is in spite of the fact that previous studies have warned of DEET 's dangers .
For example , earlier research by Duke University Medical Center pharmacologist Mohamed Abou - Donia , who has spent 30 years studying the effects of pesticides , found that prolonged exposure to DEET can impair functioning in parts of the brain and could result in problems with muscle coordination , muscle weakness , walking or even memory and cognition .
In the new study , Corbel and his colleagues discovered that DEET inhibits the acetylcholinesterase enzyme .
This is the exact effect organophosphate and carbamate insecticides have on the body , too .
Alarmingly , these insecticides are often combined in products with DEET -- and the scientists found that DEET interacts especially well with carbamate insecticides , magnifying their toxicity .
" These findings question the safety of DEET , particularly in combination with other chemicals , and they highlight the importance of a multidisciplinary approach to the development of safer insect repellents for use in public health , " Corbel stated .
Another study published earlier this summer in the , a peer - reviewed journal of the American Chemical Society , showed that a natural substance , cinnamon oil , shows promise as a great - smelling , environmentally friendly pesticide , with the ability to kill mosquito larvae .
The researchers also believe that cinnamon oil could be a good mosquito repellant , though they have not yet tested it against adult mosquitoes .
Historically , however , cinnamon oil has been used by natural health practitioners and traditional healers to repel mosquitoes and prevent their bites .

class MyApp < Sinatra :: Base set : views , File.dirname( __FILE__ ) enable : sessions before do halt if session [ : fail ] == true end get " / hello " do " Hello world " end get " / world " do @name = " Carl " erb : awesomesauce end get " / fail " do session [ : fail ] = true " You failed " end end
There 's a lot of functionality packed into this little package .
You can declare some code to be run before all actions , declare actions and the URL they should be routed from , use rendering semantics , and even use sessions .
We 've been saying that Rails 3 is flexible enough to use as a framework toolkit -- let 's prove it by using Rails to build the subset of the Sinatra DSL described above .
Let 's start with a very tiny subset of the DSL :
class MyApp < Sinatra : : Base get " / hello " do " HELLO World " end post " / world " do " Hello WORLD " end end
The first step is to declare the Sinatra base class :
module Sinatra class Base < ActionController :: Metal include ActionController :: RackConvenience end end
We start off by making Sinatra : : Base a subclass of the bare metal ActionController implementation , which provides just enough infrastructure to get going .
We also include the RackConvenience module , which provides request and response and handles some basic Rack tasks for us .
Next , let 's add support for the GET and POST method :
class Sinatra : : Base def self.inherited ( klass ) klass.class_eval { @_routes = [ ] } end class << self def get ( uri , options = {} , & block ) route ( : get , uri , options , & block ) end def post ( uri , options = {} , & block ) route ( : post , uri , options , & block ) end def route ( http_method , uri , options , & block ) action_name = " [ #{http_method} ] # {uri} " @_routes << {: method => http_method.to_s.upcase , :uri => uri , :action => action_name , :options => options} define_method ( action_name , &block ) end end end
We 've simply defined some class methods on the Sinatra : : Base to store off routing details for the get and post methods , and creating a new method named [ GET ] / hello .
This is a bit of an interesting Ruby trick ; while the def keyword has strict semantics for method names , define_method allows any string .
Now we need to wire up the actual routing .
There are a number of options , including the Rails router ( rack - mount , rack - router , and usher are all new , working Rails - like routers ) .
We 'll use Usher , a fast Rails - like router written by Josh Hull .
class << Sinatra : : Base def to_app routes , controller = @_routes , self Usher : : Interface .for ( : rack ) do routes .
each do |route| add ( route [ :uri ] , :conditions => { : method => route [ : method]}.merge(route [ :options ] ) ) . to( controller.action ( route [ :action ] ) ) end end end end
Here , we define to_app , which is used by Rack to convert a parameter to run into a valid Rack application .
We create a new Usher interface , and add a route for each route created by Sinatra .
Because Usher : : Interface .for uses instance_eval for its DSL , we store off the routes and controller in local variables that will still be available in the closure .
One little detail here :
In Rails 3 , each action in a controller is a valid rack endpoint .
You get the endpoint by doing ControllerName.action ( method_name ) .
Here , we 're simply pulling out the action named " [ GET ] / hello " that we created in route .
The final piece of the puzzle is covering the action processing in the controller itself .
For this , we will mostly reuse the default action processing , with a small change :
class Sinatra : : Base def process_action (*) self .
response_body = super end end
What 's happening here is that Rails does not treat the return value of the action as significant , instead expecting it to be set using render , but Sinatra treats the returned string as significant .
As a result , we set the response_body to the return value of the action .
Next , let 's add session support .
class << Sinatra :: Base def set ( name , value ) send ( " _set_#{name} " , value ) end def enable ( name ) set ( name , true ) end def _set_sessions ( value ) @_sessions = value include ActionController : : Session if value end def to_app routes , controller = @_routes , self app = Usher : : Interface .for ( : rack ) do routes . each do |route| add ( route [ :uri ] , :conditions => { : method => route [ : method]}.merge(route [ :options ] ) ) . to( controller.action ( route [ :action ] ) ) end end if @_sessions app = ActionDispatch :: Session ::CookieStore.new ( app , {:key => " _secret_key " , : secret => Digest :: SHA2.hexdigest(Time.now.to_s + rand ( 100 ) .to_s ) } ) end app end end
There 's a few things going on here .
First , Sinatra provides an API for setting options : set :option , : value .
In Sinatra , enable : option is equivalent to set : option , true .
To simplify adding new options , we just delegate set : whatever , value to a call to _set_whatever ( value ) .
We then implement _set_sessions ( value ) to include ActionController : : Session , which provides the session helper .
In to_app , we wrap the original application in an ActionDispatch : : Session : : CookieStore if sessions were set .
Next , we want to add in support for callbacks ( before do ) .
It 's only a few lines :
class Sinatra : : Base include AbstractController :: Callbacks end class << Sinatra : : Base alias before before_filter end
Basically , we pull in the normal Rails callback code , and then rename before_filter to before and we 're good to go .
Finally , let 's dig into rendering .
class Sinatra :: Base include ActionController :: RenderingController def sinatra_render_file( name ) render : template => name.to_s end def sinatra_render_inline ( string , type ) render : inline => string , : type => type end % w ( haml erb builder ) .
each do |type| define_method ( type ) do | thing| return sinatra_render_inline ( thing , type ) if thing.is_a ?( String ) return sinatra_render_file ( thing ) end end end class << Sinatra : : Base alias _set_views append_view_path end
We include the RenderController module , which provides rendering support .
Sinatra supports a few different syntaxes for rendering .
It supports erb : template_name which renders the ERB template named template_name .
It also supports erb " Some String " , which renders the string uses the ERB engine .
Rails supports both of those via render : template and render : inline , so we simply defer to that functionality in each case .
We also handle Sinatra 's set : views , view_path by delegating to append_view_path .
You can check out the full repository at https://github.com/wycats/railsnatra/
So there you have it , a large subset of the Sinatra DSL written in Rails in under 100 lines of code .
And if you want to add in more advanced Rails features , like layouts , flash , respond_to , file streaming , or conditional get support , it 's just a simple module inclusion away .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- Former Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge says he successfully countered an effort by senior Bush administration officials to raise the nation 's terror alert level in the days before the 2004 presidential vote .
Ex -Homeland Security Chief Tom Ridge says he was pushed to raise the terror alert before the 2004 election .
" An election - eve drama was being played out at the highest levels of our government " after Osama bin Laden released a pre-election message critical of President George W. Bush , writes Ridge in his new book , " The Test of Our Times . "
Attorney General John Ashcroft and Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld strongly advocated raising the security threat level to " orange , " even though Ridge believed a threatening message " should not be the sole reason to elevate the threat level . "
The former Pennsylvania governor also writes that he saw no reason for the move , which he now calls a bad idea , because additional security precautions had already been taken in advance of the election .
" We certainly did n't believe the tape alone warranted action , and we were n't seeing any additional intelligence that justified it .
In fact , we were incredulous , " Ridge said of the push . " ... I wondered , ' Is this about security or politics ? ' " Watch panelists discuss Ridge 's allegations »
The idea that an attack might take place had been discussed , he says .
" But at this point there was nothing to indicate a specific threat and no reason to cause undue public alarm .
...
It also seemed possible to me and to others around the table that something could be afoot other than simple concern about the country 's safety . "
In the end , the threat level was not raised .
Frances Townsend , a former Homeland Security adviser to President Bush and now a CNN contributor , denied politics played any role in the request to raise the threat level .
" There was a debate , " Townsend said Thursday on CNN's " The Situation Room . "
" Tom Ridge was n't the only person in that meeting who suggested that the terror alert should n't be raised .
At no time was there any discussion of politics at that meeting .
And the president was made a recommendation , a consensus recommendation from the council that he accepted , not to raise the terror alert . "
According to 2004 exit polls , one in five voters said terrorism was the most important issue to them .
Of those , 86 percent voted for Bush , 14 percent for Democratic candidate John Kerry .
Ridge said that he had mixed emotions about the incident at the time , and that after it ended , he knew he had to follow through on his plans to leave the government .
He also writes that the White House added language praising the president to an August 2004 statement on a newly discovered terror threat , and that he believes he should have delivered the warning as written , and pretended that he had accidentally left out the new wording .
" I should have known better , " wrote Ridge , calling the incident one of his few regrets related to his time in public service .

Happiness is catching , new research has confirmed , and depends on how cheerful about life your friends feel .
Happiness is spread through social networks and exists in clusters of close friends and neighbours , according to a study published today in the British Medical Journal .
Being around happy people at work does not help , the research found ... - happiness is most contagious in your street .
Living next door to somebody who becomes happy can increase your own chances of happiness by 34 % .
The research was carried out by academics from the University of California in San Diego , who used data from the Framingham heart study in Massachussetts , which has been going since 1948 .
Most of the children and many of the grandchildren of the original participants are regularly monitored to establish the state of their health .
Professors Nicholas Christakis and James Fowler have carried out research on the impact of social networks on other aspects of health and found that they influence obesity and smoking habits .
The current study was designed to find out whether happiness is peculiar to an individual or dependent on the people around him or her .
The researchers assessed the happiness of people ( whom they termed egos ) and their friends , neighbours and relations ( alters ) .
They asked whether they agreed or disagreed with four statements relating to the previous week : " I felt hopeful about the future , " " I was happy , " " I enjoyed life , " " I felt that I was just as good as other people . "
Happiness was a perfect score in all four .
The academics found it does not matter how many friends you have .
" Having additional social contacts is helpful to the ego's happiness only if the extra social contacts are happy themselves , " said Chistakis and Fowler .
What is important is how happy your friends are and how close to you they live .
GAZA 
An acute struggle is emerging within the Hamas movement , which rules this coastal Palestinian strip , over the extent and nature of its Islamist identity .
Guardians of religious morality , some self - appointed , others from within the government , have sought to impose their views in recent months .
So far , top government officials have pushed them back , but it remains unclear for how long .
Examples of the battle abound .
The most threatening occurred in mid-August when an extreme group called the Warriors of God commandeered a mosque in the southern city of Rafah and , calling Hamas impure and collaborationist , declared strict religious law to be in force .
Hamas forces surrounded the mosque and , after an all - night gun battle , killed about two dozen people , including the group ’s leader , and arrested 155 others , Hamas officials said .
The Interior Ministry is now monitoring mosques and sponsoring public lectures against Muslim extremism .
Other cases involved no violence but plenty of coercion .
The chief justice decreed this summer that female lawyers must wear the hijab head covering in court .
A committee set up by the religious affairs ministry sent men along the beaches instructing bathers not to touch each other in public and to cover up .
And a number of teachers and headmistresses in girls ’ high schools told their students to dress in long coats and hijab rather than the jean skirts of past years .
All of those rules have already been reversed .
Prime Minister Ismail Haniya told the chief justice , Abed al - Raouf Halabi , to rescind his order to female lawyers , and he did so .
U.S. Representative
Mike Rogers of Michigan's 8 th district
asks " Why should we punish the 85 % of Americans who have earned health care benefits as part of their employment , and punish the employers who give it to them , to try to cover the 15 % of Americans who do n't have it ? "
On whether or not to look at the camera , anyway :
Actually , that does not appear to be the final official portrait .
Good thing , because this almost seems like one of those band photos where they all insist on broodingly staring off in different directions .
There are , for whatever reason , at least three shots of the new Court floating around the Internet .
The actual portrait , I think , is this shot that appears today on the New York Times blog " The Caucus " :
This one is better : Sotomayor looks happier , Alito less terrified , Kennedy and Stevens stopped chatting , and , in a moment of rare agreement , Roberts and Stevens both decided to look at the camera .
Justice Breyer has n't moved at all , and for some reason I have the feeling that he assumed that position hours before anyone else arrived .
Justice Ginsburg is standing in both pictures , despite having just been released from the hospital .
I assume there is some protocol - related reason why none of the gentlemen in the front row has offered her a seat .
Bad news for VAIO owners out there hoping to use Windows 7's XP mode or run any other hardcore virtual machine applications --
Sony disables the required hardware virtualization features of its laptops for " security reasons . "
That means XP
Mode wo n't work on any VAIOs , but there 's hope yet : Sony 's Xavier Lauwaert says that the company will re-enable VT on " select models . "
We 'll see what that means going forward -- XP Mode is a niche feature , but it 's still pretty lame for Sony to be intentionally disabling hardware features .

* Al Shabaab pull teeth , citing strict Islamic law
* Resident says teeth removed by masked man
* Doctors fear crude methods may spread disease
( Adds doctor 's quotes )
By Abdi Sheikh
MOGADISHU , Aug 10 ( Reuters ) - Somali Islamist group al Shabaab is forcibly removing gold and silver teeth from residents in southern Somalia because it says they contravene strict religious law , locals from a coastal town said on Monday .
Residents in Marka say al Shabaab has been rounding up anyone seen with a silver or gold tooth and taking them to a masked man who then rips them out using basic tools .
" I never thought al Shabaab would see my denture as a sin .
They took me to their station and removed my silver tooth , " resident Bashir told Reuters .
" I met several men and women whose dentures were being pulled out by a masked man they called a doctor .
The doctor used a pincer or his gloved hand depending on the strength of the tooth , " Bashir said .
" As you smile your silver tooth accuses you .
I was at a counter with my friend when three armed al Shabaab ordered me to follow them , " he added .
" I am afraid they want to make money from taking all this precious metal . "
Al Shabaab officials declined to comment .
The Islamist group says the gold and silver teeth are used for fashion and beauty , which is against strict interpretations of Islam , residents told Reuters .
The crude dental work has fuelled fears of health risks .
" Pulling or replacing teeth may lead to loss of blood and neurological damage .
The tooth may break and the remaining piece may cause sepsis , " Mohamed Mohamud , dean of faculty of medicine at Mogadishu 's Benadir University , told Reuters .
" Worse , careless treatment may spread HIV , " he added .
Al Shabaab , which means " Youth " in Arabic , is an al Qaeda - inspired militant group that has taken control of large swathes of south and central Somalia .
The group 's hardline interpretation of Islamic law has shocked many Somalis , who are traditionally moderate Muslims .
Some residents , however , give the insurgents credit for restoring order to the regions under their control .
In June , al Shabaab officials in one of the group 's Mogadishu strongholds ordered four teenagers to each have a hand and a foot cut off as punishments for robbery .

Some online provocateurs launched an internet meme claiming Glenn Beck killed a young girl in 1990 to parody his maddening fact - free rhetorical style .
Now Glenn
Beck 's trying to shut down their web site , ensuring that people will write about it .
Glenn
Beck always says false things and then says , " I 'm just asking questions . "
Like yesterday , when — after the White House threw Van Jones under the bus — he said , " Will Van Jones still work with the White House ?
[ I ] ca n't get answers . "
So some funny kids over at Fark decided to amplify that little trick thusly : " Did Glenn Beck rape and murder a young girl in 1990 ?
We 're not saying he 's guilty , but he wo n't deny it ! "
And an internet meme was born — according to Mediaite , last week the top suggested Google search terms when you typed in " Glenn Beck " were " rape " and " murder " ( they 've since been scrubbed ) .
Last week , an anonymous 34 - year - old computer science student decided the meme needed a home , so he started GlennBeckRapedandMurderedaYoungGirlin1990.com , complete with a fake arrest report and a plethora of information on the " case " :
We think the gag strides the border between clever and stupid : Accusing someone , even in jest , of raping and murdering a young girl is tasteless and damns the whole enterprise with useless hyperbole .
But the site 's mimicry of Beck 's bullshit tactics is right - on : " We await evidence that he did n't rape and murder a young girl in 1990 ! "
In any case , it 's a relatively harmless little internet parody that now Glenn Beck is making sure you know about by trying to shut it down :
His lawyers are claiming that the site is a " defamatory domain , " which it would be if any reasonable person could come away from the site believing that Beck actually did rape and murder a young girl in 1990 .
But it 's an obvious attempt to parody his style , and his efforts to shut it down will only increase the number of times " Glenn Beck raped and murdered a young girl in 1990 " are encountered by Google 's indexing bots .
According to the site 's proprietor , who would n't give us his name and therefore should be regarded with suspicion , Beck 's lawyers have gone after the domain registrar , the hosting service , and even the data center that houses the servers on which his site lives .
" They basically tried to contact every level to shut it down , " he says .
" My hosting service is n't happy with the situation , but they 're standing by me until they get a court order . "
The anonymous proprietor says he wo n't reveal his identity because " I do n't want my house to get egged , " and says the site is designed to " release frustration " about the way the right wing distorts political debate .
" I 'm not actually accusing him of these things , " he says .
" He uses these techniques . "
The paper trail of Beck 's efforts to shut the site down can be found here .
We contacted Beck 's personal publicist , who declined to comment but confirmed that Beck believes the site to be defamatory and is trying to get it taken down .
Anyway , that 's the story of GlennBeckRapedandMurderedaYoungGirlin1990.com , the site that promotes for parody purposes the false rumor that Glenn Beck raped and murdered a young girl in 1990 .
And here 's the gag that started the whole thing :
Several world leaders sounded off on climate change Monday , three months ahead of talks in Copenhagen seen as a make - or - break moment for getting a global deal on reducing carbon emissions .
Australia mooted a compromise plan that would take some heat off emerging economies such as China .
Britain ’s Gordon Brown warned that talks currently faced an impasse .
And reports said Japan too would unveil its own initiative .
The climate change hubbub comes ahead of a special United Nations summit Tuesday , and a series of meetings later in the week between United States President Barack Obama and foreign counterparts on the sidelines of this week 's G20 summit in Pittsburgh , Penn .
One goal of those talks will be to find common ground for a global deal on cutting emissions .
Talks slated for December in Copenhagen will seek to forge a new global climate - change treaty to replace the Kyoto Protocol .
The main rift now is between developed countries , led by the US , and rapidly developing economies such as India and China .
The US wants those countries to make stronger pledges on cutting emissions before it will sign on to a pact ; the poorer countries want compensation for inking a plan they fear could curb economic growth .
The Australian newspaper reported on that country 's compromise plan , to be announced later Monday .
The plan would remove pressure on China and other developing nations to set emissions targets , but would still require such countries to " submit their own binding ' schedule ' of how and where their reductions could be made . "
Australian Prime Minister Kevin Rudd urged the nation 's leaders to move quickly , the paper reported .
Meanwhile , British Prime Minister Gordon Brown also urged action , The Guardian reported , quoting from a forthcoming report in Newsweek .
And former Prime Minister Tony Blair , in New York ahead of the UN summit , aimed to help break the impasse with calculations showing that 10 million jobs could be created and the world 's GDP boosted by 0.8 percent by 2020 if nations agree to big greenhouse gas cuts , the Associated Press reported .
Japan , under its new Prime Minister Yukio Hatoyama , is also set to unveil a new plan , dubbed the " Hatoyama Initiative , ” under which Tokyo will " drastically cut its greenhouse gas emissions while promising vigorous support for developing countries in climate technology and funding , " The Japan Times reports .
But The New York Times reported that European leaders still think the US has a " lack of political will to adequately address climate change , " and that resistance to a climate change pact remains entrenched in some quarters of America , raising concerns that US opposition could scuttle a global deal .
Was war noch gleich das SPD - Modell dazu ?
Arbeitsmarkt ?
Hat die SPD mit Ein-Euro - Jobs und Hartz IV nachhaltig zerstört .
Chancengerechtigkeit ist ein übelkeitserregender Neocon - Kampfbegriff , mit dessen
Benutzung sie sich krass demaskiert hat , wahrscheinlich ohne es zu merken .
Chancengerechtigkeit sagt nämlich , dass die Leute nicht ein Recht auf gutes Leben haben müssen , sondern nur die Chance auf gutes Leben , d.h. wenn man jedem ein Lotterielos in die Hand drückt , hat man Chancengerechtigkeit , und das ist ja auch genau das , was INSM und ihre Jünger gerne erreichen wollen .
Die Leute sollen alle arm gehalten werden , aber mit Taschenspielertricks wie " Chancengerechtigkeit " verarscht man sich hinreichend , dass sie das mit sich machen lassen .
Und die Wirtschaftskrise hat die SPD ja auch hervorragend in den Sand gesetzt mit ihrer Bankenrettung und der resultierenden Monsterverschuldung für jeden von uns .
Wenn ich mir das mal so angucken , dann wäre in jedem dieser Punkte kein Programm besser gewesen als das SPD - Programm .
Aber weiter im Text .
Da kommen dann so Höhepunkte wie
Ja , selbstverständlich nehme ich die Sorgen der Internetgemeinde sehr ernst .
Ich habe das immer getan und auch öffentlich deutlich gemacht .
Ich befinde mich konstant im Dialog mit Vertretern der Internetgemeinde .
Aber wenn ich etwas politisch für richtig halte , dann kann ich das nicht fallen lassen , weil eine bestimmte Gruppe der Internetnutzer droht , eine andere Partei zu wählen .
Das hätte mit konsequenter und geradliniger Politik nichts zu tun .
Oh und noch eine schöne " beleidigte Leberwurst " Stelle :
Und es ist ja nicht so , dass wir nicht mit den Kritikern der Internetsperren geredet hätten .
Ihre Argumente sind berücksichtigt worden , wir haben die Regelung eng ausgestaltet , Rechtsschutz eingebaut und das Ganze auf drei Jahre befristet .
Zur Wahrhaftigkeit im politischen Diskurs würde es gehören , das auch anzuerkennen .
Oh und sie tritt für eine Selbstregulierung des Internets ein .
Die Länder sollen sich verpflichten , für ein sauberes Internet zu sorgen !
Als Vorbild nennt sie den Großvater aller vollständig verkackten Initiativen , das Kyoto - Protokoll !
Harharhar .
Selbstverpflichtungen sind besser als ihr Ruf !
Oh und dann sagt sie , wieso die Piraten keine Chance haben :
Es reicht nicht , wenn sich die Programmatik einer Partei darin erschöpft , einem Lebensgefühl Ausdruck zu verleihen nach dem Motto : wir sind jung , wir kennen das Netz und ihr Alten versteht davon nichts .
Was die Piratenpartei zudem von den Grünen in ihren Anfängen unterscheidet : Ihr fehlen die Galionsfiguren mit politischem Profil , wie beispielsweise Otto Schily oder Joschka Fischer .
The following distinction between development and expansion , made by Amory Lovins of the Rocky Mountain Institute , is central to the idea of sustainable population .
"
The assumption that economic prosperity requires growth seems so reasonable that most of us do n't think much about it .
After all , it 's what we 've always been told ; politicians , business boosters , economists , and the media all seem to take it for granted .
The assumption is so pervasive that virtually every American community is looking for ways to grow out of its economic problems , even when those problems are themselves the result of growth .
The trouble is , the word " growth " has two fundamentally different meanings : " expansion " and " development . "
Expansion means getting bigger ; development means getting better , which may or may not involve expansion .
This is no mere semantic distinction .
Many communities have wasted a lot of time and energy pursuing expansion because that 's what they thought they needed , when what they really needed was development .
To avoid confusion , let 's define growth here only as getting bigger — expansion — and development as getting better . "

Recently , while working on the insurance rider for a charitable event , officers of that organization received the following email from a Vice President of their insurance company , from his office in Bloomington , Indiana , on — as you will see — the company account .
The company ?
The Hyland Group , which is a diversified insurance company that also includes health insurance .
According to the Huffington Post , the officers of that company gave almost exclusively to Republicans in the last presidential campaign , with the exception of one broker who gave $ 2,300 to Hillary Clinton .

Health Ins. VP sends Obama Hate - mail on Company Account
The following quotes from the Sunday , September 27th , 2009 edition of the Bloomington , IN Herald - Times , the local newspaper .
Please note :
You have to have subscription to access the links .
City cutting ties with Hylant Group Executive who sent anti-Obama e-mails has resigned Bloomington will suspend its work with Hylant Group of Bloomington after a vice president sent an insensitive and racially charged e-mail on his company account , Mayor Mark Kruzan said Saturday .
Also , a Hylant Group executive said Saturday that he had accepted the resignation of Denton " Denny " Flahualt , the Hylant vice president who sent the racially charged e-mail .
Hylant does not have a contract with the city , but acts as a middleman between the city and insurance carriers .
Hylant reviews and analyzes insurances plans from carriers and then provides the city with input as to which plan the city should choose .
The insurance carriers , and not the city , pay Hylant .
Kruzan said it was a combination of the inappropriateness of the e-mail and the company ’s response to it that led to his decision .
" It ’s not even a close call that there has to be a response from the city of Bloomington as a Hylant customer , " Kruzan said .
" That response is not to do business with the company in 2010 . "
" The company ’s lack of direct ownership of the issue requires that the city act in a way that makes it clear that we expect more from companies with whom we ’re doing business , " Kruzan said .
The e-mail , sent by Flahault , the former vice president of Hylant Group of Bloomington , includes various images of President Barack Obama : as a communist , as Adolf Hitler and more .
One image depicts Obama , surrounded by communist and Muslim symbols , urinating on a map of the United States .
Richard Hylant , regional vice president of Hylant Group of Toledo , said the images in the e-mail portray bigotry and are political hate messages , which serve no purpose in this world .
" I hope people do n’t have the impression that we have n’t reacted strongly , because the organization condemns this kind of behavior , " Hylant said .
Hylant said he ’s not worried about losing other business and will explain the situation to any customer who asks .
Reached Saturday afternoon , Flahault declined to comment for this article .
...
The news about the email had been reported in an earlier article in the Herald - Times , September 25 , 2009 .
Again , the entire article requires subscription .
Exec ’s e-mail on Obama termed ‘ very disturbing ’ VP of local chamber ’s Large Business of Year criticized for sending out images of president A day after Hylant Group of Bloomington was honored as the Greater Bloomington Chamber of Commerce ’s Large Business of the Year , a vice president for the company is being assailed for sending out an inappropriate and racially - tinged e-mail on his company account , using his company signature .
The e-mail includes various images of President Barack Obama : as a communist , as Adolf Hitler , as the nerdy African - American child character Steve Urkel from the television show " Family Matters , " and as Mad magazine icon Alfred E. Neuman .
One image depicts Obama , surrounded by communist and Muslim symbols , urinating on a map of the United States .
... On Thursday , Denton " Denny " Flahault , vice president of Hylant Group of Bloomington , acknowledged sending the e-mail .
" Unfortunately , yes , " he said .
" It was not intended for the individual who received it and it was completely a mistake . "
Jon Strole , regional chief operating officer for the Hylant Group , also said it was a mistake by an employee .
" We do have a policy for employees in terms of you are not supposed to use your office e-mail to send personal things of that nature .
We will deal with that internally , " he said .
" Denny has apologized to the Kiwanis organization and that has been accepted by their folks , " the Toledo - based corporate officer said .
Williams , the blogging journalist , linked the e-mailed images to the " pernicous racism " underlying attacks on the president , particularly over his call for health care reform .
Audrey McCluskey , director of the Neal - Marshall Black Culture Center at Indiana University , viewed the materials and wrote in an e-mail that they were " very much racially - tinged . "
She continued : " The easiest response would be to keep the temperature up by branding this outrageous slander as racist and giving the perpetrators the attention they crave .
My question is , what is it about the American character that produces such images , and why do so many good people remain quiet in the face of it ? "
Carolyn Calloway - Thomas , associate professor in the department of communicaions and culture at IU , termed the images " brutal and very disturbing " and wrote : " The images also serve as awful , scary replacements for argument and reason , which should be elevated in civic discourse .
If health care matters and President Obama ’s public polices ARE THE main issues under contention , then why is it necessary for one to resort to pushing images of President Obama with a dark mustache ( with a swastika nearby ) against a red background — all signifying that President Obama IS Hitler ?
Words and images matter ! "
Update :
As I glanced over this diary and responses as I get ready to leave for work this morning , I want to say that I am , as always , impressed when the thoughtful members of this community show up for a discussion .
Many of you have gotten the point I wanted to get across by reporting this incident in the context I chose of comparing my personal recent experience with family .
It is not just the public instances like this .
It is how we choose to deal with our friends and our family .
Remember : Silence is consent .
No matter how you handle it , the time is well past to just remain silent in the face of the greatest resurgence of overt racism I have seen since my late teens and early twenties , the teens lived amidst the era of Bull Conner and the dogs and fires hoses in Birmingham , and the early 20's amidst the era of national race riots and the Vietnam war , and the assassinations of Martin Luther King and Robert Kennedy .
Silence is no longer an option .
I point out in a comment I added this morning that the time is well past when Obama and the Democrats should be responding to this madness , not sitting in silence .
Even Doonesbury is turning on Obama on this point :
Doonesbury Hits the Nail on the Head
Update Part Deux :
I do in fact believe that there is implicit criticism of Obama in the Doonesbury cartoon , as I note do others in the blog - o - sphere today .
For instance , John Aravosis over at America Blog had the same take , in fact , he titled his blog entry ' Doonesbury has turned on Obama ' .
I think there is definitely implicit criticism of Obama for not responding strongly enough to the incredible unhinged attacks by the right wing , which I think are clearly what is portrayed in the panels of the cartoon leading up to the final frame .
Over the weekend , White House communications director Anita Dunn announced the official beginning of the Obama administration ’s war with Fox News .
Of course , the battle has been openly brewing for months now .
Even during the campaign , Obama ’s team gave up on sending surrogates to the network .
“ It was beyond diminishing returns , ” Dunn told the New York Times .
“ It was no returns . ”
But now the war is out in the open .
“ We ’re going to treat them the way we would treat an opponent , ” she told the paper .
“ As they are undertaking a war against Barack Obama and the White House , we do n’t need to pretend that this is the way that legitimate news organizations behave . ”
Yesterday on CNN , she clarified : “ Fox News often operates almost as either the research arm or the communications arm of the Republican Party . ”
The White House ’s logic seems to be that there ’s no point in trying to be fairly portrayed on Fox News .
Even if they send administration officials to try and reason with its hosts and viewers , the way the information gets presented eliminates any net benefit .
( Especially when hosts like Glenn Beck make up facts and present them as sincere truth — the Times cited a moment when even fellow Fox reporters were angered that Beck claimed Fox White House correspondent Major Garrett was “ never called on ” in the briefing room , when he had in fact been called on that very day . )
It ’s also helpful to have a foil to fight against .
In the continuing effort to portray tea partiers and birthers and the like as a sort of faux - patriotic lunatic fringe , the act of isolating Fox is an easy way to draw some lines in the sand .
( We think online slideshows are just as effective , frankly . )
But there are plenty of negatives to this take - no - prisoners approach .
To begin with , each regular Fox News viewer does not only represent one vote lost to President Obama .
There is literally no limit , other than cholesterol - induced high blood pressure , to how angry this constituency can get .
And an angrier group — which , we have seen , is easily organized and mobilized by the network — is one that is more likely to try to win over other voters , more likely to donate and raise money , and more likely to engage in the kind of meaningless , but attention - getting , tactics that make their views seem more widely held and genuinely American than they actually are .
Yes , this kind of thing alienates some moderates , but in this era of endless , confusing news input , coverage is everything .
( Remember the health - care town - hall protests ?
Suddenly the opinions of this guy were reaching hundreds of thousands of viewers , and not just through Fox . )
So if Team Obama ignores
Fox , it just gives the network ’s talent the chance to further caricature him as a socialist , foreign , effete , America - hating Other .
It is n’t a racist portrayal , necessarily , but is certainly one that gives actual racists a lot of comfort .
Not countering that will help
Fox viewers conveniently forget that Obama is intelligent and well spoken .
George Bush , who certainly was n’t the latter , came across as human and likable in interviews .
It was one of his greatest strengths ( and for critics , one of his most confounding attributes ) .
Recognizing
Fox as an enemy worth fighting is an admission of weakness for a president whose appeal has been partly predicated on the promise of unity .
Glenn Beck , with his 3 million viewers , has been called a “ cultural phenomenon . ”
You know what ?
So is Glee , a show with well more than twice that many viewers .
Hysterical conservative hyperbole is n’t America .
A showtune - singing multiracial gang of hopeful high - school losers , including a gay kid and a pregnant teen — that ’s America .
Beyond the fact that Fox will use this White House move to boost their ratings ( Obama winning the election has always been their golden ticket — they ’re on track now for their best year ever ) , it makes it seem as though they ’re actually wounding the president .
When you ’re winning , acknowledging the enemy is n’t necessary .
( Remember when Obama would n’t do those ten town halls with McCain ? )
And this will allow mike - toting bullies like Glenn Beck to claim that they ’ve cowed the president .
No doubt we will hear in the coming weeks that Obama is “ afraid ” of Fox News .
When he spoke to every network except for Fox last month , host Chris Wallace called his administration “ the biggest bunch of crybabies I have dealt with in my 30 years in Washington . ”
Glenn Beck would never have the balls to say to Obama ’s face what he ’s said on air over the past few months .
And now he ’ll never have to .
Bill O’Reilly , at least , during the election , went toe - to - toe with Obama .
But he was positively docile , for him , when he did it — distinctly more polite and deferential than he is to almost any other liberal - leaning guest .
O’Reilly , whatever you think of him and his opinions , is undoubtedly an intelligent , well - researched guy who is quick on his feet and firm in his convictions , which are largely unhysterical .
Glenn
Beck does n’t have the wit , the knowledge , or the spine of Bill O’Reilly — but now we ’ll never get the chance to see that proven .
Barack Obama himself does n’t need to answer all of the insane rhetorical questions asked of him by Glenn Beck and his compatriots .
That would obviously be a mistake .
But legitimizing Fox News in this manner seems nearly as bad .
Either way , he ’s playing their game .
White House : Fox News ‘ a wing of the Republican Party ’ [ NYDN ]
Fox ’s Volley With Obama Administration Intensifying [ NYT ]
“ Do you want to see the tooth ? ” Dr. Mehrdad Makhani asked me Friday morning at the free clinic being staged inside Inglewood ’s Fabulous Forum .
“ Come .
I ’ll show you . ”
Jenny McLean , 36 , opened her mouth and Makhani aimed a little flashlight in there .
“ You see here ? ” he said .
The area around a back tooth was red and swollen , and McLean ’s eyes were teary with discomfort .
She ’d endured the pain for more than a year because she ’s had neither insurance nor the money for a dentist since losing her job as a social worker .
Advertisement
It was a story repeated hundreds of times last week at the Forum , where a nonprofit called Remote Area Medical had brought in volunteers to treat legions of the uninsured .
“ Here , look at this , ” said Makhani , pointing to a second tooth that would have to be extracted and yet another that needed a root canal .
Makhani pointed me to another dentist .
“ Talk to him .
He ’s worked in Brazil . ”
That would be Joseph Chamberlain , a Westwood dentist who said he ’s done charity work in Brazil , but not in conditions like this .
Advertisement
“ They have a nice system of public hospitals and clinics , ” he said .
But do n’t patients have to wait for treatment ?
“ Yes , ” Chamberlain said .
“ But not like this .
Not for a year . ”
Stan Brock , who founded RAM in 1985 to bring medical care to Third World countries , told me that in 1992 he began getting requests to do the same work in the United States .
Advertisement
“ The people we ’re seeing here have teeth as bad as the people in the Upper Amazon , ” said Brock , who used to tangle with wild beasts on “ Mutual of Omaha ’s Wild Kingdom . ”
It would be nice if we could send Brock to the nation ’s capital and have him grab the vipers and hyenas by their necks until they work out a healthcare reform plan .
But Brock has a better idea :
The nation ’s leaders should instead come spend a day at one of his clinics and learn a thing or two .
He pulled out a chart showing that at his last medical jamboree , in Virginia , volunteer dentists performed 4,304 tooth extractions in two days , among various other medical procedures .
“ President Obama was just down the road somewhere a couple days later , talking about healthcare , ” Brock said .
“ I think it would have been a lot more interesting if he came to our clinic . ”

Eugene Taw , an ear , nose and throat specialist with the Buddhist Tzu Chi Free Clinic in Alhambra , was one of many Forum volunteers who has worked in other parts of the world .
Yes , he said , there are far too many parallels between the uninsured in the United States and the residents of impoverished Third World nations .
At the Forum , his patients included a diabetic amputee who had not been able to buy his medicine for months , a retiree who could n’t afford an X - ray for a lung problem , and a 30ish female diabetic with a kidney ailment so serious that Taw called for an ambulance to take her to a hospital .
“ This is great for helping people in need , ” Taw said of the Forum clinic .
“ But it ’s not a good way to do healthcare . ”
Diabetes and hypertension require regular maintenance , Taw said , rather than occasional urgent trips to an emergency room after the patient deteriorates and the treatment is more expensive .
By some estimates , Taw said , 85 % of the estimated 47 million uninsured Americans are members of working families .
So why not divide the cost of their health insurance evenly among employer , employee and the government ?
Advertisement
Taw said he ’d seen the Friday headline in The Times about the latest cut in California ’s Healthy Families Program budget , which means nearly 670,000 children could lose medical coverage by next June .
A disaster in the making , he said .
Yes , and Brock told me the biggest difference between the Third World and the United States is that in our country , children have had far greater access to doctors .
The huge turnout each day at the Forum made it clear that although Southern California has quite a few free medical and dental clinics , there are n’t enough to handle the demand .
Among those waiting patiently for help was Walter Samwel , a 70 - year - old Vietnam vet from Gardena who has been putting off a root canal for two years .
I asked Samwel why he did n’t go to the VA and he said they ’re swamped with recently returning vets , and more severe dental problems take priority .
He had arranged time off from his part - time job as a maintenance man at a Long Beach senior center to come to the Forum , but this was his third attempt to get help .
The first two days , his number was too high , and the dental clinic shut down before he was called .
Would his Medicare cover the dental work ?
Advertisement
No , he said .
There ’s lots it does n’t cover .
There ’s something shamefully wrong , I told him , when a man who served his country overseas for seven years ca n’t get basic dental care .
“ This is true , ” Samwel said , “ but nobody wants to hear it . ”
Across the Forum , Adrienne Teeguarden was waiting for her first eye exam in 2 1 /2 years .
Since her layoff as a clothes designer , she ’s been working as a part - time nanny and ca n’t afford health insurance or glasses .
Advertisement
Greg Pearl , an optometrist who has done medical relief in Mexico and South America for Volunteer Optometric Services to Humanity , said it ’s outrageous that vision and dental care are not in most U.S. insurance plans and are rarely part of any conversation on healthcare reform .
When I asked him about differences in the patients he sees overseas and in clinics such as the one at the Forum , he had a quick answer .
“ Here , the patients speak English . ”
I ca n’t say I was surprised by the spectacle at the Forum , but with each of two visits , I knew I was witnessing the perfect distillation of an unconscionable societal failure .
Whether the answer includes the public option Obama has pitched , or the clampdown on obscene insurance company profits proposed by a doctor friend of mine in Wednesday ’s column , a civil society has no excuse for not finding a better way .
Advertisement
“ I do n’t have the answers , ” said Makhani , the dentist who insisted I look closely at his patient ’s ailing mouth .
“ I ’m not a politician .
But I have people here with infected teeth , gums , abscesses .
I saw a lady bus driver who lost her job and she ’s walking around here crying .
Her tooth is infected , she ’s in pain and she can die from this .
This is disastrous .
This is a Third World country and people need to come and see this . ”
Like hundreds of other volunteers at the Forum , including roughly 20 dentists simultaneously working on patients while many , many more waited their turn , Makhani had but one motive .
“ Why do I do this ?
What do you think ?
Look at the need , ” he said .
“ What would you have done ?
Just look at the need . ”

There 's never enough money to pay for a nation full of sick people
Why I do n't carry health insurance
We 're all criminals ?
( Natural News )
There 's a popular video circulating on the ' net right now about how to escape handcuffs without using a key .
Americans are watching the video to bone up on essential skills that will soon be needed for health care reform , it seems , since the new laws that are about to be put in place call for Americans to be arrested and thrown in jail if they refuse to buy health insurance .
This has now been confirmed by Tom Barthold , the Chief of Staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation , in a hand - written note to a Republican Senator ( http://www.politico.com/livepulse/0909/Ensig... ) .
And it 's not merely about jail time ; it 's also about the $ 25,000 fine that could be levied by the IRS against individuals who refuse to buy health insurance .
That this is even being considered just boggles the mind .
If a person is too broke to afford health insurance right now , how are they supposed to be able to buy it after paying a $ 25,000 fine and spending a year in prison ?
As Paul Craig Roberts brilliantly pointed out in a recent essay , this is like trying to solve the homeless problem by forcing homeless people to buy a home , then throwing them in prison when they can't afford to .
Up to twelve U.S. states are now considering legislation to override the federal government 's intent to require mandatory health insurance ( http://slatest.slate.com/id/2230521/entry/1 ) and ( http://www.timesoftheinternet.com/114518.htm... ) .
There 's even a growing argument that requiring Americans to buy health insurance is unconstitutional ( http://www.cbsnews.com/blogs/2009/09/21/taki... ) .
And there 's no question that imposing a penalty on Americans who refuse to buy health insurance is , indeed , a new tax ( http://www.boston.com/bostonglobe/editorial_... ) .
The current health care disaster in America is not simply a problem of people refusing to buy health insurance ; it 's an issue of people not being able toto buy health insurance .
When the annual insurance premium for a family of four is something above , that 's a terrible financial burden that many Americans simply can't afford to pay -- especially when so many people have lost their jobs due to the faltering economy .
The brutal facts of the matter are inescapable :
The American people are too broke to buy their own health insurance , and the American government is too broke to buy it for them .
The whole nation is going bankrupt over runaway health care costs .
And why ?
I hate to invoke the " I told you so " phrase in a crisis like this , but the reasons for all this have been apparent for many years , and we 've been regularly reporting them on Natural News : that pushes deadly chemicals and medically - unjustified surgical procedures instead of teaching people how to stay well .
As long as junk food companies and pharmaceutical companies are allowed to run advertisements on television , and as long as the FDA and FTC continue their campaigns of censorship against nutritional cures and natural remedies , we willhave a health care crisis .
You know why ?
BecauseI do n't have health insurance .
Well , not the kind people normally think of as health insurance .
As a result of not paying premiums for over five years now , Why do n't I need health insurance ?
Because I do n't visit doctors and I do n't get sick .
If you do n't get sick , Of course , silly doctors ask , " Well what if you suddenly get sick out of the blue ?
" What , you mean through voodoo or something ?
Sickness without cause ?
Do doctors really believe inthat magically appears without reason ?
All sickness has a cause .
That much should be obvious .
And if you eliminate the causes of disease , you wo n't experience disease .
That 's why I haveYep , my nutrition is the only health insurance I need .
In my garden in Ecuador , we grow huge quantities of health - protecting foods and superfoods .
Those foods , combined with high - end nutritional supplements ( Moxxor , Living Fuel , Boku Superfood , etc. ) provides the perfect nutritional environment for outstanding health .
That gets further supported with daily sunshine and exercise , plus the complete avoidance of toxic chemicals in consumer products ( I do n't use conventional shampoos , soaps , deodorants , hair products , skin products , etc. ) .
Given this level of natural health , why would I bother with conventional health insurance in the first place ?
Pharmaceuticals are of no use to me .
Neither are prostate screening procedures , annual checkups or vaccinations ..
So why should I be forced to financially support the health insurance companies that push these poisons onto health consumers ?
President Barack Obama wants to label me a criminal .
He wants to fine me twenty - five thousand dollars and throw me in prison for one year for my refusal to pay money into a corrupt , broken sick care system .
Note that the people who are destroying their own health -- and putting huge cost burdens on the health care system -- are not considered criminals at all .
People can destroy their own bodies through junk foods , toxic chemicals and substance abuse ... but as long as they pay up , they 're considered " good Americans " who are participating in the health care system .
Meanwhile , people like me who take care of our own health , who place no burden whatsoever on the health care system , and who refuse to pay mandatory premiums into a corrupt health insurance industry are going to be threatened with arrest and imprisonment .
This disturbing fact tells me that Obama , much like Bush before him , .
America is being turned into awhere parents have their children stolen away by cancer clinics ( true story ) , where chemical injections are enforced at gunpoint ( also true ) , and where unaffordable , inefficient and utterly ineffective " sick care " is forced upon citizens with or without their consent .
The whole premise of democracy is being destroyed in this quest to appease the sick care system that preys on upon the American people with each passing year .
" But wait , " some people say .
" Full participation is all for the greater good .
" No , not really .
What would be best for the greater good would be the transformation of the FDA and FTC into agencies that actually protect the public instead of Big Pharma .
The greater good would be served by legalizing free speech for nutritional supplements and natural remedies , ending the tyranny of attacks against medical marijuana , and sending all the MDs back to medical school so they could learn something about nutrition .
The greater good is in no way served by forcing Americans to funnel yet more money into a corrupt , broken system of dishonest insurance companies and unethical hospitals pumping people full of deadly pharmaceutical chemicals .
That system is dead .
It has failed , and it has no place in the future of any successful nation .
If we do n't soon recognize this fact and seek to advance into a new era of natural medicine and disease prevention , ( And we 're already half - way there ... )
Thanks to the sick - care policies of previous presidential administrations , the American people today have already lost their health .
And now , with Obama 's reform proposals , they are about to lose their freedoms , too .
Albert Einstein once said , " Problems can not be solved by the same level of thinking that created them . "
And yet Obama is bringing no genuinely new thinking to the table on health care reform ; he 's just changing .
Now , more than ever , our national leaders need to not just think outside the box ; they need to stomp on the box , disassemble the box , throw the box in the recycling bin and forget there ever was a box .
They need revolutionary solutions that can help this country overcome its addiction to pharmaceuticals and junk food while unleashing a new era of personal health combined with personal responsibility .
Until that happens , all this talk about health care reform is just the senseless animation of lips and vocal chords without purpose .

MUMBAI ( Reuters ) - Cars and utility vehicle sales in India grew about a third in July , their best performance in a year , thanks to new launches and easier availability of finance , raising hopes for a strong pick up in the coming months .
Workers assemble cars at Hyundai 's plant in Sriperumbudur , about 45 km ( 28 miles ) north of Chennai in this February 2008 file photo .

The revival , which began in February after a six - month slide , has been mainly led by cars , especially in the compact segment , spurred by launches of new models such as Maruti Suzuki ’s Ritz premium hatchback and Tata Motor ’s much - hyped Nano .
Maruti , India ’s top carmaker in which Japan ’s Suzuki Motor Corp has a 54 percent stake , reported a 33.4 percent jump in July sales , also riding on strong demand for its Swift and A - Star exports .
The company , which sells every second car in India , has posted higher sales for six months in a row and its June quarter profit unexpectedly jumped a quarter , helped by lower commodity prices .
On average , July sales for Maruti , Tata , Mahindra & Mahindra Ltd , the country ’s top utility vehicle and tractor maker , and Hyundai Motor India have risen by about one - third , according to Reuters calculations .
Official industry - wide figures are expected next week .
The improving outlook has lit a fire under automobile stocks , with Mahindra and Maruti leading the by way , both rising about 80 percent in the past three months .
Shares in Maruti , which has a market value of $ 9.1 billion , hit 1,515 rupees on Tuesday -- their highest since the company went public in 2003 .
“ If auto sales show further growth the stocks will rise more .
I believe there is further upside to these stocks , ” said Milind Pradhan , head of equities at Standard Chartered - STCI .
The auto sector index has rallied 64 percent in the past three months , more than double the 31 percent rise in the main index .
“ Besides the improving finance availability in the automobile sector , it is the slew of new launches in the past few months that has helped the automakers to increase their volumes recently , ” brokerage Sharekhan said in a note .
The rebound is in sharp contrast to troubles in major world markets , where sales have crumbled in the past 12 months due to an economic downturn and tight credit markets , driving U.S. firms General Motors and Chrysler to bankruptcy and restructuring .
TRUCKS IN SLOW LANE
But Indian trucks sales , which are seen as a barometer of economic activity , are yet to pick up .
Top truck maker Tata Motors , which also owns the premium Jaguar and Land Rover brands , reported a 27 percent rise in trucks sales in July , helped mainly from its small trucks .
Demand for medium and a heavy trucks remain sluggish .
Deepesh Rathore , auto analyst at IHS Global Insight , said the research agency was set to upgrade its growth forecast for cars and small trucks later this year although there was the risk of interest rates rising at some point when the economic picks up .
“ Our original forecast for 2009 was 5 percent .
But we are watching the sales ... we will look at this month ’s sales and what they have for the festive season and then we are thinking of raising our forecast to 7 percent , ” he said .
The festive season starts in August and extends to October .
If crude climbs beyond $ 80 a barrel it will start to pinch auto sales , but rising prices of steel and aluminium will not have an immediate impact because of long - term contracts already tied up , Rathore said .
Brokerage Indiainfoline said it expected sales and profit margins to improve for at least another two quarters .
The Danes like to think of themselves as green .
Denmark is home to the world 's largest wind turbine manufacturer , Vestas .
And today , the giant state - owned energy company , Dong Energy , opens the world 's largest windfarm .
But the Danes have a dirty secret .
For Dong Energy , while greening its image at home , is busy building coal - fired power stations elsewhere in Europe .
First in Germany , and now in Scotland .
We in the rich world are used to the idea of our big companies dumping their dirty and anti-social industries on the poor countries .
But now European companies are doing the same to us .
Rather as if Scotland were a banana republic somewhere in the developing world , it is the recipient of Dong " outsourcing " the dirty end of its energy portfolio .
Dong , which began as a North Sea oil and gas company before buying the country 's electricity utilities , trades on its green image in a country that likes to be thought of as green .
Its website announces that the company is " part of the solution " to climate change , and it lovingly pictures its efforts to " move energy forward " on a sea of wind turbines .
Today Denmark 's king and prime minister will both be on hand as the record - breaking 209 - MW Horns Rev 2 windfarm opens off the west coast .
But Dong also sees itself as a diverse energy provider , and wants to grow in the coal business , too .
It would be unlikely to get permission to build a new coal - fired plant at home , however .
The Danish government last December proposed that the EU should limit carbon emissions from new power plants to 500g per kilowatt hour – far too low to accommodate a coal - fired plant .
So , what it cannot do at home , it is intent on doing abroad .
It is planning to build a giant 1600 MW coal - fired plant at Greifswald in northern Germany .
And now in Scotland , Dong is to take a 75 % stake in a new joint venture with local company Peel Energy to build a similar behemoth at Hunterston , west of Glasgow .
It would be the first new fossil - fuel burning power plant in Scotland for 30 years – a real step backwards for the country that has pioneered wind power in Britain .
I have written about Scotland talking green and building for coal before .
The Scottish Nationalist government is keen to end the country 's reliance on nuclear power , and to that end they are covering the glens in wind turbines and dotting the coastline with coal - fired power stations .
Dong 's new Hunterston plant would be built next to a nuclear power station .
But Dong , like many coal companies , is keen to give the dirtiest fossil fuel a makeover .
For instance , it says it will add some biofuels to the coal in the boiler to create a " super - efficient multi - fuel power plant " .
Both the German and Scottish plants will this way reduce emissions by 20 - 30 % compared to conventional coal power stations , it says .
But sorry , it will still burn coal .
Burning coal produces roughly twice the CO2 emissions of even another fossil fuel like natural gas .
So that 20 - 30 % cut still leaves it among the dirtiest plants around .
WWF estimates the new plant 's carbon emissions will be 6.9 m tonnes a year .
So it would still be outlawed by the proposed new EU rules .
The other greenwash favoured by coal - burners is to hold out the prospect that emissions will soon be cleaned up and buried under ground using carbon capture and storage .
Dong says the construction plans for the £ 2bn Hunterston plant " include the development of carbon capture and storage " , but adds the caveat " once the CCS technology has been fully developed . "
As I have written before , that 's quite a caveat .
By some counts , that day will not happen till towards the end of the plant 's lifetime , if at all .
Dong Energy may be an efficient coal - burner .
But dressing that accomplishment up as a green technology is greenwash .
When it goes on the coal trail , Dong looks like part of the problem , not part of the solution .
Once again , the Sunday faithful have packed the cavernous sanctuary at Shepherd of the Hills Church in the San Fernando Valley , clapping and swaying for Jesus as a band rocks the hall .
“ Come bless the Lord , ” the worshipers sing .
“ Praise his name to the ends of the Earth . ”
Most churches would be thrilled to fill their sanctuaries any day of the year .
Shepherd of the Hills , a nondenominational church in Porter Ranch , does it six times a weekend , attracting 8,000 people to its energetic services and offering a lesson about the growth of evangelical Christianity in California .

Thanks to good weather , sprawling suburbs and a number of charismatic pastors , the Golden State has more of these megachurches -- defined as those with at least 2,000 congregants -- than any other state .
California is home to 193 , slightly more than Texas with 191 , according to the most recent survey by the Hartford Institute for Religion Research , one of the nation ’s leading authorities on megachurches .
The majority of these congregations are in the suburbs between Los Angeles and San Diego , an area that some who study the phenomenon call the Southern California Bible Belt .
A handful have risen to national prominence -- notably Saddleback Church in Lake Forest and its celebrity pastor , the Rev. Rick Warren .
But dozens of other large , if lesser - known , churches also are growing , even as many traditional houses of worship struggle to fill their pews .
Advertisement
The megachurches are expanding by adapting to changing times and tastes , scholars say .
Many have jettisoned formal rituals such as organs and hymns in favor of Christian rock music and overhead projection screens that display lyrics and prayers .
They deliver upbeat biblical messages about applying faith in everyday life and building a personal relationship with God .
They organize parishioners into small “ life ” groups that study Scripture .
And they encourage their followers to recruit new members .
Although some critics refer to the megachurch phenomenon as “ church lite , ” evangelical Christian scholars say the congregations are reaching the unaffiliated or disaffected by turning church attendance into a more comfortable , positive experience , bound by fewer rules or obligations than traditional churches .
“ They want to reach people . . . with the life - changing good news about Jesus Christ , ” said Warren Bird , research director of the Dallas - based Leadership Network , a nonprofit that disseminates information about innovative church practices .

Southern California ’s sprawling suburban housing tracts have provided ready supplies of potential new members -- including Geraldine Victoria , who was raised Catholic but decided to visit Shepherd of the Hills on a recent Sunday at a friend ’s invitation .
The 32 - year - old Glendale nurse said she was attracted to the spontaneity of the worship service , a departure from what she called the formality of Catholicism .
“ I think I want more , ” Victoria said as she emerged from the sanctuary .
Shepherd of the Hills is rapidly outgrowing its home at the foot of the Santa Susana Mountains , in the northwestern San Fernando Valley .
Its gym doubles as a second sanctuary , and church leaders have plans for a 3,500 - seat auditorium .
It also has opened satellite church campuses in Agua Dulce , Lancaster , Woodland Hills , the Westside and Fremont , near San Jose .
“ We ’re bursting at the seams , ” said senior pastor Dudley C. Rutherford , one of 29 ministers on staff .
“ We ’re not big on ritual and form .
We ’re big on touching your heart and letting the word of God speak to you . ”

The number of megachurches has grown steadily for the last four decades .
Researchers say there are now at least 1,350 such churches nationwide , more than double the number a decade ago .
They draw an average of 4,100 weekend parishioners .
By contrast , most U.S. churches attract 500 people or fewer on Sundays .
“ They are essentially re-creating a small - town milieu and giving folks . . . a place to plug in and share experiences with like - minded people , ” said sociologist Scott Thumma of the Hartford Institute for Religion Research in Connecticut , who studies the megachurch movement .
But the growth also has sparked criticism that large churches are siphoning people away from smaller congregations .

Megan Rief , for one , left her Lutheran church in La Verne for Christ ’s Church of the Valley in San Dimas , which attracts about 4,500 people to its large worship center each weekend .
The 25 - year - old bank teller said the formalities of her former church -- including the robed clergy , hymnals , organ and repetitive liturgy -- left her uninspired .
At the San Dimas church , she found what she called a fresh approach to her Christian faith that emphasizes a joyful , free - flowing worship and the importance of maintaining a relationship with Jesus seven days a week rather than only on Sundays .
At church , she also met fellow Lutherans , along with Presbyterians and Methodists , all searching for new ways to express their spirituality .

“ I ’ve become a lot more comfortable in my faith and willing to share that with people , ” said Rief , who now volunteers at the church Thursday nights , greeting college students who are treated to dinner and lively worship services .
One recent night , she welcomed visitors for a chicken dinner and then joined them for the service that looked and sounded like a rock concert -- with a band , dimmed lights and lyrics about Jesus projected on overhead screens .
Southern California has long been a laboratory of church innovation .
The Rev. Robert H. Schuller , one of the most influential American pastors of the last half - century , preached from the roof of an Orange County drive - in theater snack bar in 1955 , and later launched his “ Hour of Power ” television ministry and built the Crystal Cathedral in Garden Grove .

In 1965 , Pastor Chuck Smith opened Calvary Chapel in Costa Mesa , a tiny nondenominational congregation that welcomed hippies and changed the way many American Christians worship by combining literalist Bible teaching with contemporary rock music and casual dress ( Smith is fond of Hawaiian shirts ) .
The worship style helped Smith expand his single church into an empire of 1,500 independent congregations nationwide .
He said several thousand people attend services each weekend at his sprawling Orange County home church , which has 25 pastors , a school and a radio ministry .
“ I believe there is a great spiritual hunger , ” said Smith , 82 , who still preaches weekly .
“ Jesus said , ‘ If any man thirsts , then come to me and drink . ’ ”

About 85 miles to the south , a newer congregation has demonstrated a deft marketing hand of its own , drawing large numbers through its doors by appealing to niche interests .
San Diego ’s Rock Church offers a multitude of ministries , including those for dog lovers , rock climbers , skateboarders , four - wheel - drive enthusiasts , people with eating disorders , even strippers and mimes .
Since it opened in 2000 , the church has more than tripled in size .
Each weekend , 12,500 adults and children pray in its sanctuary .
Members also are encouraged to put their faith to use in the world outside of the church , which has set a goal this year for its members to perform 600,000 “ Do Something ” hours of service in San Diego County and beyond -- mentoring children , picking up trash , planting trees .

“ In the end , God calls us to grow , ” said Pastor Miles McPherson , a former San Diego Chargers football player who heads the church .
“ It ’s not a gimmick .
It ’s not a technique of a man .
It ’s got to be the Lord doing it . ”

The question / suggestion above is , of course , mind - boggling .
While I do n't have numbers in front of me , I 'm going to imagine that the balance of Medicare ( which the gummint best keep its hands off of ! ) by party distribution is slanted toward Republicans .
In a country with so many uninsured poor , no matter what party affiliation , the thought of scaring people with insurance with the threat of party - based denial of health care just makes the rage meter go to the top .
Of course , while this question is the real fear - based mover and shaker , the rest of the survey is hardly innocent .
It reads like a Fox News broadcast , with sly asides to death panels ( using age and life expectancy to allocate health care ) , to talk of the dangers of trying to " ram health care legislation through Congress " .
The word " ram " in any survey just seems out of place .
In any event , please look at the survey - for all it appalls , it provides a clear picture of every talking point the opposition will be using in the next few weeks to fight against the U.S. 's best interest , and everything that Senator Kennedy has fought for .
I wish I could write more , but the work of writing real , scientific and balanced surveys has to fall on someone today , since we know the RNC definition of a poll is just another instrument of propaganda and fear .

The BBC is the only UK media outlet that has signed up to Fast Flip Google has unveiled a service called Fast Flip to let users consume news more quickly and to boost the flagging fortunes of the news industry .
The product is designed to mirror the way readers flick through magazines and newspapers .
Google has teamed up with more than 30 providers such as the BBC to provide what it calls a new reading experience .
The search giant was recently called a parasite for making money aggregating content it did not create .
" I do n't believe we are part of the problem .
I believe we are part of the solution , " Google 's vice - president of search , Marissa Mayer , told BBC News .
" We have tried to build platforms and tools that build a healthy , rich eco-system online that is supportive of content .
This is a new way of looking at content . "
Earlier this year , Wall Street Journal chief Robert Thomson called the search company and other aggregators such as Yahoo " parasites or tech tapeworms in the intestines of the internet " .
The news industry has been struggling with how to broaden the size of its online audience and how to make money from content it has long given away free .
Last month , media mogul Rupert Murdoch said he hoped all of his major newspapers would be charging for online content by the end of June next year .
Preferences Fast Flip imitates a conventional print publication by offering screenshots of the web pages containing relevant articles .
Newspapers have struggled to make money from online content
The stories are organised following a number of different criteria .
For example , readers will be offered articles that have been popular all day , that reflect their personal preference or that have been recommended by friends .
Users who want to dig deeper into the story can click through to the publisher 's website .
To make money , Fast Flip also serves up contextual adverts around the screenshots .
Publishers who have signed up to provide content to the service will share in that revenue ; that was proof , said Ms Mayer , that Google was keen to help the industry at a time when it was clearly struggling .
" We are excited to team with publishers and look at a new possibility for how people might consume news online and how to monetise it , " said Ms Mayer .
Google admitted that there was no " magic bullet " to quickly solve the challenges the publishing industry faced but it added that " we believe encouraging readers to read more news is a necessary part of the solution " .
Ms Mayer said the science behind this was simple .
" Advertising responds well when you have engaged users .
" If you have users that stay on the site for a long time and who do a lot of page views , all of those are good measurers because you will have a better chance to engage them with the ads and learn from their behaviour what type of ads to target , " explained Ms Mayer .
Hands - on control Ms Mayer told TechCrunch 50 , a conference aimed at start - up companies , that Google co-founder Larry Page had asked why the web was not more like a magazine , allowing users to flip from screen to screen seamlessly .
Delegates were told that one reason had to do with media - rich content that took time to load - five to 10 seconds .
Fast Flip marries the best of the web and publishing , said Google " Imagine if it took that long to flip a magazine page , " said Krishna Bharat , a distinguished engineer at Google who led the creation of the Google news service .
" We wanted to bring the advantages of print media , the speed and hands - on control you get with a newspaper or magazine , and combine that with the technical advantages of the internet .
We wanted the best of both worlds , " said Mr Bharat .
Ms Mayer revealed that initially they thought a solution to the problem posed by Mr Page was " a decade away " .
She explained that Google had long been trying to harness increased speed , " shaving a millisecond here and another millisecond there " .
But Ms Mayer said that the success of Fast Flip was down to having a specific problem to solve .
" A big part of innovation is having the right goal and asking the right question , " she said .
Initially Fast Flip will concentrate on audiences in the US .
The BBC is the only UK - based media outlet to have a presence on the site , due largely to its popularity in America .
Other publishers involved include Cosmopolitan , Marie Claire , Elle , Popular Mechanics , Slate , Salon , the New York Times , the Washington Post and ProPublica .

Writing in the New York Times last month , President Barack Obama asked that Americans " talk with one another , and not over one another " as our health - care debate moves forward .
I could n't agree more .
Let 's engage the other side 's arguments , and let 's allow Americans to decide for themselves whether the Democrats ' health - care proposals should become governing law .

In this television image broadcast by ETTV Sunday , a six - storey hotel in Taiwan collapses and plunges into a river after flood waters eroded its base .
( ( ETTV Television / Associated Press ) )
As many as 600 people are unaccounted for in Taiwan after a mudslide caused by Typhoon Morakot struck a mountain village , a police official and a villager said Monday .
Morakot dumped about two metres of rain on some communities in Taiwan over the weekend before moving on to China , where it forced the evacuation of nearly one million people from coastal areas .
Medical personnel evacuate children by a military helicopter on Monday from a village struck by a landslide when Typhoon Morakot swept southern Taiwan . ( ( Reuters ) )
A Taiwanese police official who identified himself by his surname , Wang , told The Associated Press that about 100 people were rescued from a mudslide in Shiao Lin on Sunday .
At least 400 people are believed to still be trapped in the area , the official said .
Meanwhile , one of the rescued villagers , Lin Chien - chung , told United Evening News that he believed at least 600 people were still buried in the mud .
" The mudslide covered a large part of the village including a primary school and many homes , " he said .
" A part of the mountain above us just fell on the village . "
The village remained cut off on Monday by flood waters and destroyed roads and bridges .
Military helicopters dropped provisions into the area and were working to rescue survivors .
Continuing bad weather was preventing the helicopters from landing , said official Yang Chiu-hsing .
Taiwan is currently reporting that 14 people died from Morakot and 51 are officially listed as missing .
22 dead in Philippines
The storm is also believed to have left at least 22 dead in the Philippines .
Officials said 18 people were injured and four people are missing , including three European tourists who were swept away .

Morakot has now been downgraded to a tropical storm .
The China Meteorological Administration reported that as of early Monday , the storm continued to pack winds of about 83 km/h .
When the typhoon slammed into China 's Fujian province on Sunday it was carrying heavy rain and winds up to 119 km/h , according to the meteorological administration .
In China , the storm flooded hundreds of villages and towns and caused more than 2,000 houses to collapse , according to the state news agency .
Officials said the storm had killed six people and left three missing in China .
Morakot is the first typhoon to hit the area this year .
Typhoons frequently move in between July and September , often causing injuries and deaths in mountainous regions prone to landslides and flash floods .
Meanwhile in Japan , Typhoon Etau slammed into the west coast Monday killing at least 12 people in Hyogo prefecture , about 500 kilometres west of Tokyo , according to officials .
About 2,200 people have been evacuated from their homes in the region and 500 homes were flooded .
Many people are believed to have been caught in the raging waters and at least 10 people have been officially reported as missing , according to police .
'' This whole process of policymaking … has been one of the worst examples of policymaking we 've seen on major issues in Australia , '' he said .
Despite the poll findings showing more support for nuclear power , the Rudd Government yesterday restated its total opposition to it as an option to help Australia meet its future carbon reduction targets .
During the 2007 election campaign , after prime minister John Howard put nuclear power on the agenda , then opposition leader Kevin Rudd said : '' If you elect a Labor government , there will be no nuclear reactors in Australia , full stop . ''
Supporters of nuclear power say it is the only practical low - emissions alternative to coal for generating baseload electricity - the minimum required by industry and residential users .
Arguments against focus on safety - the risk of accidents and the fact that radioactive waste must be stored securely for thousands of years .
Opponents also say it would take too long develop a nuclear power industry .
Ziggy Switkowski , who chairs the Australian Nuclear Science and Technology Organisation , said : '' [ We must ] provide for the next generation of baseload electricity generation with clean energy .
The only way to do that is with nuclear power . ''
Support for considering nuclear was strongest among Coalition supporters ( 58 per cent ) , and opposition was strongest among Greens voters ( 62 per cent ) .
ALP voters were evenly divided , with 46 per cent in favour and 46 per cent opposed .
Survey respondents were told : '' The introduction of nuclear power has been suggested as one means to address climate change ' ' , and then asked : '' Do you support or oppose the Federal Government considering the introduction of nuclear power in Australia ? ''
Federal Energy Minister Martin Ferguson restated the Government 's opposition to nuclear power .
He also cast doubt on the viability of photovoltaic solar power as a future energy resource .
He said the renewable sector kept falsely insisting it could be an alternative to coal as baseload power .
But he believed solar thermal technology , which uses the sun 's heat to boil liquids to power turbines , was a more likely answer .
Victorian Energy Minister Peter Batchelor dismissed nuclear power as an option for the state .
He said increased reliance on lower - emitting gas , clean coal and renewable energy sources were the way ahead .
However , hopes for a cleaner future for Victoria 's power industry received a setback last month with the abandonment of a ' ' carbon capture ' ' project at a proposed power station near Morwell , which instead is to become a gas - fired station .
In another setback for the renewables sector , Solar Systems , which was to have developed a 154 - megawatt solar photovoltaic power station near Mildura , was put into administration .
Meanwhile , the annual Lowy Institute poll has found that climate change is dropping as a priority for Australians .
The poll , released today , found Australians have gone from ranking climate change in 2007 as the equal most important foreign policy goal to putting it seventh out of 10 possible goals .
The issue fell 10 points since last year and 19 points from 2007 .
But Lowy executive director Michael Wesley said 76 per cent rated climate change a problem and those who felt this way viewed getting a solution as increasingly urgent .
As the Opposition prepared to put a package of amendments on emissions trading to Parliament next week , political sparring continued over the costs of curbing emissions .
Frontier Economics and independent senator Nick Xenophon hit back at Treasury 's claim that Frontier 's blueprint , commissioned by the Opposition ( and Senator Xenophon ) , had a $ 3.2 billion hole .
They accused Treasury of misunderstanding the ' ' credit and baseline ' ' approach to emissions trading and getting its sums wrong .
Senator Xenophon said Treasury was acting politically .
He said he could not support the Government 's scheme unless it included changes to the way the electricity sector was treated .
There was a risk the Government 's model would cause energy security problems , including blackouts .
The Seven Network reported an analysis commissioned by the NSW Government from Frontier last year on the Rudd Government scheme said that in the long term it could lead to real wages 8 per cent below the level they would otherwise reach , if long - run unemployment was to be avoided .

AC Milan believe they are in pole position to secure David Beckham 's loan return to the San Siro in January .
Italian giants confident about return of England star
Good relations
AC Milan believe they are in pole position to secure David Beckham 's loan return to the San Siro in January .
The veteran England midfielder joined the Italian giants in a similar move last term as he sought playing time to stay in England boss Fabio Capello 's thoughts .
While the Los Angeles Galaxy player has the option of returning , there are also thought to be " three or four other offers " .
But the Italian club remain confident that the 34 - year - old will decide to return to the San Siro .
Milan director Umberto Gandini told : " We 've done this before do n't forget .
" We have good relations with David , his representatives and also Major League Soccer . "
Beckham 's loan earlier this year was funded jointly by the player and Milan .
Gandini added : " It 's true all parties made sacrifices .
The extent of the sacrifices I do n't think needs to be judged or evaluated .
" We are very open .
We are discussing the possibility of the agreement and we are aware of what David is saying , what David is thinking .
We have our convictions and therefore we think we are going towards a deal . "
He added : " He 's an icon , a brand - he 's a lot of things for many people .
For us he's an excellent player and we would like him back . "
JK Rowling was denied Presidential award because George Bush believed Harry Potter ' encouraged witchcraft '
JK Rowling lost out on the U.S. 's highest civilian honour because members of the Bush administration objected to the author 's perceived promotion of sorcery , a new book claims .
Matt Latimer , a former speech writer for George W Bush , states in Speechless : Tales Of A White House Survivor that as a result her name was not included amongst those receiving the Presidential Medal of Freedom .
The award acknowledges contributions to the U.S. national interest , world peace or cultural endeavours .
Denied : A new book , Speechless , Tales Of A White House Survivor , claims that JK Rowling was denied a prestigious presidential award under George Bush 's administration because he believed she ' encouraged witchcraft '
In one of his last acts as head of state , Mr Bush gave the medal to former British prime minister Tony Blair .
President Barack Obama recently bestowed the honour on physicist Stephen Hawking , among others .
But according to Mr Latimer 's new book , plans for Ms Rowling to receive the Medal of Freedom were nipped in the bud by officials in the previous administration .
He claims that the White House politicised the honour under the Bush regime .
In Speechless , Latimer writes that ' narrow thinking ' led ' people in the White House to actually object to giving the author J K Rowling a presidential medal because the Harry Potter books encourage witchcraft ' .
Others denied the privilege under the Bush administration included Senator Edward Kennedy .
The veteran politician and health care activist was excluded because he was deemed to be too liberal , it is alleged in Speechless .
In August , Mr Obama awarded the medal to Mr Kennedy just days before he died of cancer aged 77 .
JK Rowling 's alleged exclusion is not the first example of her writing coming into conflict with the American right .
In 2007 , Fox News commentator Bill O'Reilly hit out at the author for announcing that Harry Potter character Dumbledore was gay .
He called her a ' provocateur ' adding that the outing of Dumbledore was part of a liberal ' indoctrination ' of children .

Some of Our Milestone Employment Law Cases
Olympia Snowe admitted to Andrea Mitchell that the Senate Finance Committee is not even considering a public option in their bill and never had it on the table .
She said that the skyrocketing costs of health care are paramount to their bill which is why they are ogling co opts .
Mitchell :
So bottom lines , Nancy Pelosi says that they will not produce anything that does not include a public option .
Do you see any way that the gang of six will come out of the Finance Committee with a public option ?
Snowe :
No , I do n't .
We have not had the public option on the table .
It 's been co ops and addressing affordability and availability and plans through the exchange and those are the challenges we 're wrestling with to insure that there are basic plans to offer Americans .
You can count on the gang of six of working on problems that do n't include real solutions .
This is a reversal on what she said to Andrea back in June when she said co ops were worthless .
Snowe : ... states today can create co-ops as a matter of fact , but we want to make sure that not just incorporating the status quo .
In other words , if these co-ops were to be formed , Americans still could not have access to affordable , quality plans then you really do have to have a contingency plan , with a fall back plan of some kind to make sure that you do have the conditions to ensure that Americans do have access to an affordable plan .
Today for example in the state of Maine , you do n't have the purchasing power necessary to leverage competitive prices so it really has kept so many people and so many small businesses out of the market , we want to make sure that 's not what we repeat as we try to reform and provide universal access and coverage to all Americans .
Why is she now on board with co ops when she knows they suck ?
Is Chuck " Killin ' Grandma " Grassley her daddy ?
Nancy Pelosi reiterated today that there is no way a health care bill passes the HOUSE without a public option .

DUBAI ( Reuters ) - A website often used by al Qaeda supporters said on Thursday it would soon carry a “ present ” to Muslims from Osama bin Laden on the occasion of the holy month of Ramadan .
The Islamist website gave no further details , but messages by the al Qaeda leader have usually appeared within about 48 hours of being announced on the Internet .
In his latest message in June , bin Laden said U.S. President Barack Obama had planted the seeds of “ revenge and hatred ” toward the United States in the Muslim world .
Bin Laden ’s remarks were issued just before a major speech by Obama who said he sought a “ new beginning ” between the United States and the Muslim world .
Bin Laden ’s message in June and another recording issued by his deputy Ayman al - Zawahri appeared to be a drive by al Qaeda to pre-empt Obama ’s speech to the Muslim world .
Later in June , CIA Director Leon Panetta said the U.S. intelligence agency believed bin Laden was hiding in Pakistan and hoped joint operations with Pakistani forces would find him .
Stuttgart 's former Germany goalkeeper Jens Lehmann has been dropped from the first - team squad for paying a visit to Oktoberfest at the weekend .
The 39 - year - old was spotted at Munich 's beer festival only hours after his side had been beaten 2 - 0 by Cologne in the Bundesliga , and had not been given permission to attend .
" [ The director of sport ] Horst Heldt and I will talk with Jens about this on Thursday and then we will see where to go , " said the coach Markus Babbel on the club 's website , confirming that Lehmann would not be part of the squad who travel to face Lubeck in the second round of the DFB - Pokal ( German Cup ) on Wednesday .
Lehmann apologised for breaking club rules and accepted the suspension , but claimed his motives were good .
" The visit to the Wiesn [ Oktoberfest ] was part of a charity event and it had been planned for a long time , " he said after training today .
" However , it was not agreed with the club .
Of course I accept the measures taken by the sporting management . "
Lehmann committed an error to gift Cologne their second goal at the weekend when he raced out of his area only to lose possession and allow Wilfried Sanou to shoot into an empty net from 45 yards out .
CHICAGO ( Reuters ) -
The new H1N1 virus appears to outcompete seasonal flu , making it less likely to mix with other circulating flu viruses into a “ superbug ” as some had feared , U.S. researchers said on Tuesday .

The H1N1 , or swine flu , virus also spreads more quickly and causes more severe disease in animal studies , the team said , but it shows no signs of mixing with either of the two seasonal flu viruses to form a new , so - called reassortant virus .
“ The results suggest that 2009 H1N1 influenza may outcompete seasonal flu virus strains and may be more communicable as well , ” said Dr. Anthony Fauci , of the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases , part of the National Institutes of Health .
The study , conducted in ferrets by a team at the University of Maryland , underscores the need for getting vaccinated with the new swine flu vaccine , Fauci said in a statement .
When the team infected ferrets with 2009 H1N1 virus plus either seasonal H1N1 virus or seasonal H3N2 virus , both viruses made them sick , but only the H1N1 virus spread to other ferrets , suggesting it will dominate ordinary flu .
“ The H1N1 pandemic virus has a clear biological advantage over the two main seasonal flu strains and all the makings of a virus fully adapted to humans , ” Daniel Perez of the University of Maryland said in a statement .
“ I ’m not surprised to find that the pandemic virus is more infectious , simply because it ’s new , so hosts have n’t had a chance to build immunity yet .
Meanwhile , the older strains encounter resistance from hosts ’ immunity to them , ” Perez said .
The researchers also found that the pandemic virus established infections deeper in the ferrets ’ respiratory system , including the lungs , while the seasonal flu strains remained in the nasal passages .
That confirmed observations in people .
“ The findings of this study are preliminary , but the far greater communicability of the pandemic virus is a clearly blinking warning light , ” he said .
HARDLY ANYONE IMMUNE
The World Health Organization predicts a third of the world ’s population will eventually be infected with swine flu .
Seasonal flu infects between 5 percent and 20 percent of a given population every year , but 90 percent of severe cases and deaths are among the elderly .
It kills between 250,000 and 500,000 people globally .
Perez and his team used samples of the H1N1 pandemic variety from last April ’s initial swine flu outbreak .
They found some of the animals infected with both a seasonal flu strain and the pandemic strain developed both respiratory and intestinal illness .
The team plans to study whether this combination may explain some of the deaths attributed to the new virus .
Because hardly anyone has immunity to the new H1N1 virus , experts believe it will infect far more people than usual , as much as a third of the population .
Five companies are making swine flu vaccine for the U.S. market -- AstraZeneca ’s MedImmune unit , CSL Ltd , GlaxoSmithKline Plc , Novartis AG and Sanofi-Aventis SA .
Tests have begun to determine if people will need one or two doses to be protected .
Despite calls by scientific advisers to President Barack Obama to speed up supply , swine flu vaccines are unlikely to be ready before October , the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention said last week .
Yes , I was at the health care vigil tonight in Thousand Oaks .
Yes , I saw what happened , though it was from across a very large street .
I ca n’t tell you who said what to who , but I will tell you what the mood was , what I saw , who instigated things , and what I photographed .
What I wo n’t do : I wo n’t publish the pictures I took of the confrontation .
I did n’t capture anything other than the people in various states of verbal confrontation , and I have turned those over to the police .
Because they are investigating , I wo n’t compromise it by publishing those pictures unless and until they give me permission .
I will , however , publish my other photos which will include some taken before this incident occurred .
There were around 150 supporters of health care reform present on the northeast corner of Lynn Road and Hillcrest in Thousand Oaks .
I was one of them .
To get to that corner , we had to park in the Oaks Mall parking lot , walk to the light , cross a small thruway and then cross Hillcrest , which is a very large street . [ photo here looking across to those opposed , posted in real time before the incident ] .
In order to get from the parking lot to the vigil , we were required to walk through the group of people opposed to health care reform .
As you can see in the photo , they were originally staged right before the crosswalk to the thruway , so there was no way to avoid walking through their group .
The mood on our side of the street was passionate , happy , and dedicated .
There were no violent words spoken .
For the most part , we were supported loudly by passers - by , who honked their horns and waved their support .
When someone passed by who disagreed , we actually had conversations with them while they waited for the light .
To be clear here :
There were no threats , no dark moods , and there was no mob .
I repeat , there was no mob .
We were peaceful people holding candles and signs .
One petite woman was also handing out single payer flyers .
She was passionate about it , but not rude , not mean , always smiled , and simply offered the flyer .
At some point , she crossed back over ( she may have run out of her flyer supply .
I do n’t know for sure .
But she was not in any way confrontational . )
All of a sudden , I saw a very tall man in an orange shirt ( yes , he is in the photo I linked you to ) confront her , verbally at first .
Her back was to the thruway , and he was shooing her , approaching her , speaking to her in a very aggressive fashion ( observation from body language only ) and waving his arms in a shooing motion .
With each step she took back , he took one forward , shooing her more .
From where I was , it appeared as though he were telling her to get on her own side of the street , and backing it up with a very clear physical threat .
Even from where I stood , it chilled me .
I pointed it out to others and called out for anyone with a video camera to aim it over there .
( I had a small Nikon cam with me that does video , but it would have been useless in that light . )
Ultimately , she did cross the street and come back over to our side .
Several minutes later , there was another altercation .
My best recollection is that this man saw what happened to the woman and reacted to it .
I cannot say with certainty where he was when he saw it — he may have arrived and was navigating his way through that group , or he may have crossed the street to defend her .
He was confronted by the same man .
I could tell from where I was that the man was belligerent , angry , and confrontational .
The man in the orange shirt hit the pro-reform guy ( I ’m going to call him PR Guy just to keep the players straight ) .
Hard .
( tweeted in real time )
He punched him in the face , knocked him to the ground and into that thruway .
As you can see from the photo , cars drive straight through that without stopping .
The pro-reform guy could have been run over .
He got up , tried to get back up on the curb , but Orange Shirt guy was in his face .
Finger in his face , PR Guy standing , steps up to the curb , and there ’s a scuffle .
Orange shirt seemed to have PR Guy in a hold , but again , I was across the street , so wo n’t state that as absolute fact .
Next thing I see is PR Guy ’s hat being tossed into the street , both yelling at one another , then Orange shirt walks away , PR Guy picks up hat and crosses to our side .
When he gets to our side , he tells a story in one sentence : “ He punched me hard , straight in the face , so I bit his finger off . ”
Honestly , I thought he was exaggerating .
I guess he was n’t .
I ’ve given this report to the police along with my photos .
I am not heralding anyone as a hero here .
I certainly do not celebrate the idea of anyone biting anyone else , no matter what the reason .
However , there is no question that Orange Shirt guy was aching to fight , was willing to pick a fight , and certainly did n’t care who he fought with .
He chose people who were shorter than he , and he used his voice , his body , his body language and his height to intimidate them .
Do n’t be fooled by reports ginning up sympathy for that 65 - year old guy or worse yet , reports characterizing him as a senior citizen .
He was aggressive and ready to mix it up .
I ’ll tell you more about the other hour and 15 minutes of peace , wonderful people , and stories in another post .
This one is for the benefit of those who might want to hear a different side of what is sure to hit the air as a one - sided story of liberals gone wild .
There were no liberals gone wild , nor were there hordes of conservatives behaving badly .
There were 9 or 10 people on one corner , 150 - 200 on the other , and two men who , regardless of their politics , behaved quite badly .
Update : LA Times has it a bit wrong .
So does KTLA .
Update : KTLA and LATimes have updated their stories .
• Self Defense Shooting and the Aftermath
If you spend any time at all on the various gun forums of the World Wide Web sooner or later the conversation will come around to “ What to do after a shoot ” .
The advice given by anonymous figures riding the electron waves of the Internet can be … amusing .
At best .
At worst , some of the advice given will guarantee that the shooter will be hip - deep in legal trouble for the next lifetime .
I will tell you right up front that any comments made by your Humble Scribe are worth exactly what you paid for them .
First off — and I cannot stress this enough — anyone who carries , or owns , a gun or a knife needs to know a lawyer .
First thing tomorrow — or as early as possible — find yourself a lawyer who is familiar with self - defense cases and the weapons laws of your state .
Now , folks .
Not at 0 - dark - thirty with a critter bleeding out on your carpet and red-and - blue lightbars screaming down the road .
Ask the regulars at your gun range / club who they ’d recommend .
Use your NRA , GOA , JPFO , KABA , LEAA , or SAF membership services and find out if they can point you at an attorney in your area .
Once you have the name of an attorney , go talk to him ( or her ) .
It usually does n’t cost much — or anything — to introduce yourself , sit in his office and talk about What May Come .
If you like him ( or her ) , get a couple of his cards and put one in your wallet and another under the bedroom phone where you can find them after the bodies quit bouncing .
If you should find it necessary to help a critter into his next incarnation , hopefully you or a family member will have called 911 prior to the Grand Finale — so to speak — and the whole fandango will be recorded .
However , if ( for whatever reason ) it was not possible to call 911 prior to the critter starting his trip to room temperature — please call 911 as soon as possible .
You will note that I do n’t have any advice to give as to what you should tell 911 when you call them .
Seems like everyone on the Internet has ( legal ) advice as to what you should tell the 911 operator , how you should say it , how many words to use and how many seconds to spend saying it .
In my experience , when your ears are ringing , the smell of powder and blood and various human secretions are clogging your nose , adrenaline is rampaging up - and - down your spine and a man — critter or not — that you just killed spent his last moments in this life in your presence begging God for another chance , or calling for his mother , or crying in denial and disbelief as he died …
… you are not going to be thinking of what your anonymous Internet buddy told you to say .
You ’re not even going to remember grabbing the phone , and if you are conscious of your conversation with the 911 people you have my admiration .
So .
You have called 911 .
The very next thing you should do is pull out that lawyer ’s card and call him ( or her ) .
I do n’t care how justifiable the killing was .
I do n’t care if you ’re in Deepinahearta , Texas and the deceased is laying in the middle of your living room floor with an axe in one hand and a detailed murder list in the other .
Call your lawyer .
Like it or not , guns — and self - defense itself — are political .
And District Attorneys are political animals .
Trust me , you do n’t want to be caught without a lawyer if Mike Nifong ’s evil twin Skippy decides to make his political bones with your case .
You have called 911 and you have called your lawyer .
Now — probably sooner rather than later — the scene is going to be crawling with cops .
Whatever you do , please , please , please do not greet the police while holding a pistol in your hand .
Or a knife , bludgeon , broken bottle , chainsaw or whatever else you used to shove your critter in front of his Eternal Maker .
You , standing over a dead man , with a weapon in your paw when the cops show up is a recipe for an unpleasantness .
Trust me on this one .
Again , there are thousands of folks on the Internet , each one with advice on what to do with your pistol , knife , or whathaveyou .
And — again — if you have the presence of mind to do something complicated with your gun , I salute you .
But I doubt it .
Just remember not to have the weapon in your hand , on your body or with - in arms reach when you get face - to - face with the police .
The officers are going to take custody of whatever you used to chlorinate the gene pool , and when they do — tell them where it is , but , please God , do n’t go grab it yourself to give to them .
Last , but certainly not least , if there is any subject in which every - single - body on the Internet has advice for , it ’s what to tell the cops about your shooting .
Folks , what you should or should not tell the cops is based completely upon the unique circumstances of your personal incident .
I can tell you that it ’s never a Bad Thing to not make a statement to the police before your lawyer is present , but let ’s talk Real Life here :
You have just ended the life of some mother ’s child .
You may have stared into the eyes of this person as the life drained out of them .
You may have listened to the death rattle as they took their last breath .
You may have heard this person ’s last words , or you may have simply watched them kick until they were still .
Whichever , you have just breached the most sacred of Man ’s taboos .
You have done something that cannot be taken back , and you have done the single most powerful , awful thing one human being may do to another .
In addition , you ’re going to be so jazzed on adrenaline that your teeth will hurt .
Endorphins will mask any pain — and failing to find pain , they will be tweaking your inhibitions in 23 different directions .
Your mind will have played tricks on you — sounds will have gone squirrelly ; time will have done wierd things .
And worst of all , you probably wo n’t remember entire sequences of what just happened .
Self - doubt is going to jump on your back like an 800 - pound gorilla with cold feet and clammy hands .
And you will want someone — anyone — to understand that you were forced to do this terrible act .
You will want someone — anyone — to know , to understand , that you had no choice in breaking the ancient taboo against killing .
Ladies and gentlemen , in the average self - defense shooting , it ’s not getting the shooter to talk to us that ’s hard — it ’s getting him to shut up that ’s difficult .
I can tell you to assert your right to have an attorney present during any interview with the police , but in the last 13 years of police work , I ’ve never seen a justified Average Joe self - defense shooter who was capable of doing so .
Again , you may be different .
I salute you if you are , but — again — I would n’t bet anything important that you wo n’t be like everyone else I ’ve seen in that position .
So — my advice to you is to sit down with your attorney before the Fit Hits The Shan and discuss what your attorney wants you to do in that situation .
Find out what your attorney wants you to tell the police , and try to stick with that .
Do n’t be surprised if you find yourself unable to stop talking , though .
Prepare for it , and you will probably be able to limit any damage done .

Liars For Jesus : The Religious Right 's Alternate Version of American History
A reader writes :
I attended my 1st tea party in Worcester , Massachusetts 4 months ago .
I am a conservative independent and went because I see this country going in the wrong direction FAST .
Bailing out car companies .
Bailing out Wall Street .
The so called " stimulus " debacle .
Tripling our deficit in 3 years .
Do you think I was a big George Bush fan ?
No . I was not .
He was a big spender too and he never vetoed anything .
But Andrew .... comparing the spending of Bush compared to Obama is like saying eating a jelly bean is just as fattening as eating a whole cheesecake .
TRIPLING the deficit in 8 months ???
Earth to Mars ..... do you even get this ??
Look : the only reason the deficit has tripled in eight months is the recession , which Obama inherited .
And I know of no serious person who really believes the federal government should have sat back and let the US economy spiral into the abyss rather than try to stabilize it with a bank bailout and stimulus .
To blame Obama for what amounts to inheriting an emergency bequeathed him by his predecessor is plain loopy .
And to blame him for future deficits which were a function of all those who came before him , is equally misleading and disingenuous .
Yes , blame him for deficit spending once the economy recovers .
Yes , perpare a plan for real government downsizing when and if we emerge from the Bush fiscal wreckage .
But give the president a fricking break .
The circumstances of this past year have been extraordinary .
If the position of the right is going to be : no bailouts at all , no stimulus at all , and spending cuts now to balance the budget , then they should say so .
Instead we get this adolescent hysteria , combined with no serious alternative set of proposals .
Really , my fellow small government independents : Grow up .
We want to hear what you think about this article .

Anthropology graduate student Robert Lynch has a laugh with his son , Nicholas .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
Not surprisingly , Robert Lynch begins his research paper " It 's Funny Because We Think It 's True : Laughter is Augmented by Implicit Preferences " with a joke .
Not his joke , but one taken from a toast Homer Simpson makes in a 2004 episode of The Simpsons : " To alcohol !
The cause of , and solution to , all of life 's problems . "
In his experiment , Lynch , a graduate student in the Department of Anthropology , tested the common belief that we find things funny because something about them is subjectively true - that is , it rings true for us .
His paper appears online in the journal of Evolution and Human Behavior .
Why test scientifically something that everyone accepts as obvious ?
First , Lynch said , our common sense assumptions about the world are often wrong .
Conventional wisdom once had the sun circling the earth , but science showed that assumption to be false .
Second , and much more to Lynch ’s purpose , there must be some evolutionary function for laughter since all human cultures have laughter .
“ It ’s universal , ” he said .
“ Everyone laughs at something , though not everyone laughs at the same things . ”
Lynch asked 59 undergraduates ( 26 men , 33 women ; 36 Caucasians , 21 Asian Americans , and two African Americans ) to watch a 30 - minute video of stand - up comedian Bill Burr ’s 2005 HBO special .
He chose a comic as his tool for this experiment because the comic is entirely on his or her own without other performers or laugh tracks .
Lynch selected Burr because the comedian ’s jokes often turn on race and gender , and this has made him the subject of some controversy .
Besides viewing Burr ’s comedy , the students took two computer - based implicit association tests ( IAT ) to measure their attitudes about race and gender .
IATs measure the strength of association between concepts in a person ’s memory .
The faster the subject associates two concepts - say , “ man ” and “ career ” or “ woman ” and “ cooking ” - the stronger that association is in the subject ’s mind .
Lynch also videotaped his subjects as they watched Burr ’s routine and then used the Emotional Facial Action Coding System to interpret their facial reactions to what they saw and heard .
EMFACS allows researchers to classify and deconstruct any visible facial movement and helps them understand whether a smile , for instance , is sincere or insincere .
Finally , each student watched the routine alone .
“ There was no reason for them to laugh if they did n’t think the routine was funny , ” Lynch said .
Using the IAT to determine his subjects ’ implicit attitudes , and isolation and EMFACS to protect the sincerity of their responses to Burr ’s comedy , Lynch concluded that , yes , people really do laugh because something in a joke or situation rings true for them .
So what ?
“ If implicit preferences affect our response to humor , then laughter may serve as a signal that we share the joke teller ’s beliefs , biases , or preferences , ” Lynch wrote .
Lynch ’s research suggests to him that , since humor is entirely subjective , our laughter signals to others that we have a bond with them .
He believes ability to recognize our own - however we might define “ our own ” - gives us an evolutionary advantage .
We ’re members of the same tribe .
So we feel safer sharing more information about each other ; we might share a meal , start a business , or get married .

As Rachel reports , it looks like the vote taken by 30 Republicans to protect contractors rather than rape victims is not playing very well for them in their local papers .
Jamie Leigh Jones and her attorney joined Rachel to talk about what happened to her and weigh in on the Republican response that the amendment was just a way to take a " political shot " at Halliburton .
Franken 's amendment passed , but 30 male Republican senators voted no on it .
Now , much of the outraged response to that vote across the country is due to the fact that this legislation was prompted by a horrible real - life case , the case of Jamie Leigh Jones .
The amendment said that the government should n't give defense contracts to companies if those companies prevent their employees who have been raped or discriminated against from suing in court .
When Republicans are getting called out in Mississippi , Kansas , Louisiana , Tennessee and Georgia , something big is going on politically .
This all began when 30 Senate Republicans voted against an amendment by Democratic Senator Al Franken of Minnesota .
The " Athens Banner Herald " in Georgia headlined a letter quote , " Georgia Senators Embarrass State . "
And in Louisiana , a " Shreveport Times " writer asks , quote , " What exactly is Sen. David Vitter problem with women . "
An opinion piece in the " Osawatomie Graphic " was titled simply , " Kansas Senators are Disappointing . "
In Tennessee , a " Crossville Chronicle " writers asked , " Whose Side are Our Senators On ? "
In Mississippi , " The Clarion Ledger " editorialized , quote , " Senators Cochran and Wicker voted to protect corporations , not victims , and they should own up to that . "
In Idaho , the " Lewiston Morning Tribune " called out its two senators in an editorial titled , " Senators Crapo and Risch Cast an Inexplicable Vote . "
MADDOW : One specific vote on one specific part of the giant legislation that funds the Defense Department is turning into a real political problem for 30 Republican senators .
She was a 20 - year - old female contractor at Halliburton subsidiary , KBR when she says she was drugged and gang raped by her co-workers and locked in a shipping container .
Because of her employment contract , Ms. Jones was not allowed to sue .
She still has n't had her day in court .
I want you to know that we called every single one of the 30 Republican senators who voted no on this .
Not one of them agreed to come on the show to talk about why they voted the way they did .
Senators , I want you to know , the invitation remains open .
Joining us now is Jamie Leigh Jones and her attorney Todd Kelly .
Thanks very much to both of you for coming on the show tonight .
I really appreciate it .
JAMIE LEIGH JONES , FORMER KBR HALLIBURTON EMPLOYEE :
Thanks for inviting us .
TODD KELLY , JAMIE LEIGH JONES ' ATTORNEY : We appreciate that .
MADDOW : Jamie Leigh , four years ago , you were drugged and raped for working as a contractor in Iraq that led to , not only this legislation , but to the outrage over the people who voted against this legislation .
Can you tell us briefly what happened ?
J. JONES : OK .
Well , I went to Iraq to serve my country during Operation Iraqi Freedom .
Four days upon my arrival there , I was brutally and sexually assaulted and drugged .
And when I reported my assault to Halliburton KBR , they essentially imprisoned me in a container .
And I was held captive by armed guard , by guards that were called gurkhas .
And they are guards that have machine guns and everything else and they 're hired by KBR .
And after pleading with one of the guards , he did let me contact my father , who contacted Congressman Ted Poe .
And Congressman
Poe dispatched a rescue mission to get me out of there .
MADDOW : Now , I understand you were not allowed to sue , to see that anybody was held responsible for what happened to you .
J. JONES : Right .
MADDOW : Is that because of the contract that you signed when you signed up with Halliburton ?
J. JONES : Yes , exactly .
MADDOW : How would you describe Halliburton 's role overall in responding to what happened to you ?
We know how you just described what happened immediately after the incident happened .
But what 's happened since ?
J. JONES : Do you want to comment on that ?
KELLY : Well , if you 're asking what happened from a legal standpoint , Halliburton has made every effort to force Jamie into secret binding arbitration .
If you 're asking from a sense of how they have helped Jamie , obviously , she'd be in a better situation to answer that question than I would , but I would say not very much .
J. JONES : Yes .
They have tried to completely keep this under arbitration because then , it would be quiet and secret and binding .
Then I would not be able to be sitting here in front of you today to tell my story , which I think is very crucial for other wives , mothers and daughters that want to go and serve their country by working for a contractor .
So , you know , essentially , I think that corporations should never be above going in front of a trial by jury .
And so this Franken amendment would prevent that from happening .
MADDOW : The amendment , obviously , passed and I think that we 're all watching to see what happens whether it ultimately becomes law .
J. JONES : Right .
MADDOW : The Defense Department has expressed concerns about whether or not it would be enforceable , although they say that they agree with the overall intent of it .
We do n't know what 's going to happen next .
J. JONES : Right .
MADDOW : But I have to ask your reaction to those 30 no votes .
Three out of four Republican senators voted against this amendment .
How did you feel about that ?
J. JONES : Well , I think that is really unfortunate .
I would n't - I cannot even understand the reasoning as to why anyone would vote against it .
I am very happy about the votes that we did get for it .
I 'm thrilled it 's gotten as far as it has gotten .
Hopefully , the 30 senators will have a change of heart during a conference because maybe if they tried to understand how they would feel if their daughter or wife or somebody was in my position , how they would feel if it was to go in front of an arbitrator .
Hopefully , they 'll change their position on it , so -
MADDOW : Jamie Leigh , either you or Todd - I was struck by the argument from Sen. Jeff Sessions of Alabama .
He 's one of the people who voted against it and he argued against it .
J. JONES : Yes .
MADDOW : And he said this is just a political shot at Halliburton .
This is just Democrats taking a shot at a politically unpopular company .
Can I ask you to respond to that ?
KELLY : Absolutely .
It 's not that .
In fact , if this amendment had been in place when Jamie went to Iraq , her rape most likely never would have happened .
What needed to happen is that companies like Halliburton need to have rules in place that forced their employees to obey those rules that needed to have oversight .
And they 're only going to implement such things if their actions are exposed to the light of day .
And what happened in the case of Jamie is , for years prior to her arrival there , the environment was allowed to grow and to fester .
And these people , because of the arbitration provision , were never punished .
Their actions were disposed of secretly in binding arbitration that could n't be appealed , even when the arbitrators blatantly disregarded the law .
So they created this environment that they then threw Jamie into .
And the rape occurred as a natural and foreseeable consequence of that action .
This has nothing to do with politics .
This has to do with doing the right thing by our young American women and girls that are trying to support this country like Jamie .
MADDOW : Jamie Leigh Jones and her attorney Todd Kelly , thank for telling this story publicly and fighting for this .
J. JONES : Thank you .
MADDOW : And thank you for coming on the show tonight .
I really appreciate it .
KELLY : Thank you for having us .
( CNN ) --
Easy tip number one , if you want to talk like a pirate : Add " me hearties " to the end of any sentence .
Mark Summers , aka Cap'n Slappy , left , and John Baur , known as Ol ' Chumbucket , created Talk Like a Pirate Day .
The meaning is simple -- " my friends , my mates " -- said John " Ol ' Chumbucket " Baur , before offering as way of example , " Turn your head and cough , me hearties .
Or , fill it up with regular , me hearties . "
Saturday marks " Talk Like a Pirate Day , " an observance that has been recognized on all seven continents and beyond .
It inspires dress and behavior -- of the Long John Silver variety -- in seedy bars , staid workplaces and even the International Space Station .
It has fueled fundraisers , been the topic for a New York Times crossword puzzle and mentioned on various game shows .
It was an idea born in 1995 on an Albany , Oregon , YMCA racquetball court .
Baur , 54 , and his friend Mark " Cap'n Slappy " Summers , 46 , began unleashing insults at one another , as pirates might .
Test your pirate literacy »
" We just grew up in a time and place where we saw the wrong movies , read the wrong books , " Baur said from his current home in St. Croix , Virgin Islands .
Putting their deep - thinking noggins together , the two decided the world needed in on this , too .
Fact Box Five
A's of pirate speak
Ahoy -- Hello .
Avast -- Stand and give attention ; listen up .
Aye -- I heartily agree with everything you said or did .
Aye Aye -- Yeah , boss , I 'll get on that as soon as I finish this coffee or rum .
Aarrr --
Not to be confused with Arrgh ( a sign of pain ) , it 's a way of announcing yourself to the world , telling everyone you 're here and alive .
It could mean do n't look at my girlfriend that way , or I 'm enjoying this hamburger .
Source : John " Ol ' Chumbucket " Baur
They selected September 19 , simply because Summers had recently divorced , it was his ex-wife 's birthday , and he figured " the date was stuck in my head , and I was n't going to do anything with it anymore . "
But it was n't until humorist Dave Barry caught wind of the idea and threw his support behind it in a September 2002 Miami Herald column that this rickety ship took sail .
" As the name suggests , this is a day on which everybody would talk like a pirate .
Is that a great idea , or what ? "
Barry wrote back then .
" There are so many practical benefits that I can't even begin to list them all . "
Now Ol ' Chumbucket and Cap'n Slappy have a full - fledged movement , with a Web site that gets millions of hits -- one September they got 19 million hits , Baur said -- and books such as , " Pirattitude : So You Want to Be a Pirate ?
Here 's How ! " and " The Pirate Life : Unleashing Your Inner Buccaneer . "
They offer T - shirts , have performed in Las Vegas , Nevada , and made appearances across the country .
Ol ' Chumbucket 's family even appeared on a piracy blown - out - of - proportion episode of ABC's " Wife Swap , " which the man otherwise known as Baur , a reporter and editor for a St. Croix news service , said he 's never had the stomach to watch .
Summers , a licensed clinical social worker who works with troubled kids , brings his altruistic spirit to the pirate world as well .
" Ask Cap 'n Slappy " is an advice column , featured on the pirate duo's Web site , that he started to help people help themselves -- in ways he would n't dare propose while wearing his professional " Behavior Consultant " hat .
" If Ann Landers was a drunk and flagellant pirate , " that 's what you 'd have , said Summers , who still lives in Albany , Oregon .
" Most of my solutions involve a savage beating with one 's fists or forehead . "
With their Jolly Roger flag flying , this pair embarked on a journey they never could have imagined .
" This is not what my parents would have chosen for me , but when the wave comes up , you ride it , " Baur said .
" We do it for fun .
We do n't pretend that this is serious . "
Summers said his mother , Lois , sometimes slips and calls him " Slappy , " even though she does n't really get what this is all about .
When the Dave Barry column came out , he said her comment to him in a phone call was typical mom : " I do n't know what 's so funny about talking like a pirate , but I love you anyway . "
The waters have been rocky at times for the two .
Those darned , much - publicized Somali pirates , including those who in April took Capt .
Richard Phillips hostage ( before he was rescued by U.S. Navy SEAL snipers ) , threaten to give pirates like Cap'n Slappy and Ol ' Chumbucket a bad name .
" I wrote an article for Pirates Magazine .
Yes , there is a Pirates Magazine , " Cap'n Slappy said .
It was " an open letter to the Somali pirates .
I said the AK - 47 is a vulgar firearm .
If they want to be remembered for something , they 're going to have to switch to the blunderbuss [ picture Elmer Fudd's weapon ] . "
Barry reflected on the pirate - talking cause in an e-mail Thursday , saying , " I am extremely proud of my role in helping to promote International Talk Like a Pirate Day , which I believe has done more than any other single day to further the cause of international misunderstanding . "
But Ol ' Chumbucket and Cap'n Slappy would like to think their contribution to society has yet to see its full potential .
Imagine if Israelis and Palestinians , for example , took time out to share this language and some laughter .
" Twenty years from now ? " said Cap'n Slappy .
" Nobel Peace Prize . "
All About Pirates • Somali Pirates
By Christopher Lane
I ’ll begin by admitting that I am a dyed - in - the - wool Nikon guy , and Leica wannabe .
I love my D700 .
I have strayed to Canon and Pentax , but when the chips were down I always returned to the Nikon fold .
I 've also owned several Leicas , but always wound up selling them .
Most of the problems that plagued my M8 have been solved , but these days it ’s hard for me to justify spending $ 4,000 on a camera ... especially with a college - bound daughter .
So , no Leica for moi at the moment .
Now , do n’t misunderstand me — the D700 is perhaps the best DSLR available .
But it ’s big and heavy , and , for the most part , F - mount lenses are too .
It would be wonderful to be able to throw a small , light camera over my shoulder , slip a second lens into my pocket , and go .
Even so , when Micro 4/3 was announced , I paid no attention to it .
I was settled on Nikon and Leica , after all .
It was n’t until a friend kept talking it up that I discovered that it was indeed a very exciting development .
I 've been paying attention ever since .
' One Camera , Our Lenses '
At first I was drawn to Micro 4/3 because it had the potential to be my " Poor Man ’s Leica " or the elusive DMD .
While possibly true , this was a very narrow - minded view of the new format .
Like many of you , I have a tendency to seize on one idea or get lost in technical specifications or reviews .
Sometimes I simply fail to see the forest for the trees .
It was n’t until just recently that I realized that Micro 4/3 is not just exciting : it is revolutionary .
Here ’s why .
One Nikon DSLR is pretty much like another .
Some Nikon DSLRs are full frame and most are not .
Some are bigger and some are smaller .
Some are expensive and some are cheap .
Some are faster and some are slower .
The company makes a digital single lens reflex camera .
the bells and whistles vary , but at its essence each Nikon DSLR is pretty much just a variation on the same theme .
The same goes for Canon , Pentax and Sony .
A Leica M has looked pretty much the same since the dawn of 35 mm photography , almost to the point of absurdity ( witness the location of the M8 ’s SD card slot ) .
Only when one starts considering lenses does that picture change .
The variety of glass available to the modern photographer is awe - inspiring , from super - tele behemoths to jewel - like pancakes .
Unfortunately , each manufacturer has taken a slightly different approach to lens design and construction .
For its consumer grade lenses , Canon favors ƒ/ 4 while Nikon uses ƒ/3.5–ƒ/5.6 .
Pentax has a wide selection of pancake primes , while Nikon has none .
Panasonic and Olympus have lenses in focal lengths tailored to 4/3 .
And then there are those wonderful lenses from Leica .
Each manufacturer has developed its own proprietary lens mount , further limiting your choices .
F mount , K mount , M mount , R mount , 4/3 mount .
I call this the " One Camera , Our Lenses " approach .
Nearly every market player uses it .
They make one basic camera type and give you a choice of the lenses they think you want .
This is where Micro 4/3 is truly revolutionary .
As Micro 4/3 is developed , it will take a " Many Cameras , Many Lenses " approach not tied to any specific lensmaker or camera design .
So far , Micro 4/3 has given us the DSLR - like Panasonic Lumix G cameras and the Leica - sized Olympus E - P1 , and now Panasonic 's GF1 has been announced .
That ’s just the beginning .
Doubtless there are many other designs possible , some of them likely to hit the market in the next few years .
Therefore , investing in a Micro 4/3 system does not mean tying yourself to one specific camera body type from one specific manufacturer .
You can mount the same Micro 4/3 lens on an SLR - like EVF camera one day and a compact the next .
As the English say , " simply brilliant . "
Micro 4/3 and more and more
Then there is the true implication of the " Many Lenses " part .
I have long held that , in the digital age , your first and biggest investment should be your lenses .
To a certain extent a digital camera 's shelf life is limited , but the shelf life of a good lens is not .
As I write , there are Micro 4/3 adapters available from reputable manufacturers for lenses in the following mounts : Four Thirds , Leica / Zeiss / Voigtländer M , Leica R , Nikon F , and Pentax K , and probably some others that I ’m not aware of .
There are sure to be others to come , but that ’s already quite enough for me and my pocketbook .
So now I can mount any lens from any manufacturer I like .
How much I want to spend is the only limiting factor .
I remains to be seen if other manufacturers will take the " Many Cameras , Many Lenses " approach .
Neither Canon nor Nikon seem inclined to innovate in this area .
Even if they do , Panasonic and Olympus have a big lead , and each year there will be more of the Micro 4/3 " Many Cameras " and " Many Lenses . "
If they can partner with others to develop lenses for the Micro 4/3 mount , so much the better .
Leica has clearly stated that they have no intention of developing a Micro 4/3 camera , but it will produce lenses with the Micro 4/3 mount , the first one being the newly announced 45 mm Macro .
So hooray for two of the smaller players , Panasonic and Olympus , for breaking the " One camera , Our Lenses " mold .
As I see it , that 's a real breath of fresh air and a truly revolutionary approach to camera design and development .
I ’m excited to see what ’s around the next corner .

And just so you can see clearly how GOOD TODAY ’S NEWS really is , here is a generic chart of what the sheeple are shown from the BLS , U3 unemployment .
I very subtlely pointed out the green shoot in today ’s employment situation update – it ’s there on the chart , you can see it clearly : Clearly the equity market 's reaction today was commensurate .
Oh , and the numbers were completely legit , just ignore this little chart made by Chris Martenson showing the highest “ birth / death model ” adjustments ever in the month of July :
Of course , as ugly as that unemployment chart is , I hope everyone who visits my site realizes that the current U3 number is NOT comparable to the way Unemployment used to be tracked .
Oh no .
For that , we turn to John Williams at Shadowstat.com where he presents U6 as well as his “ SGS Alternative : ” But you know what ?
Even John William ’s 20 % + unemployment calculation did n’t really grab my attention .
Oh no .
What really caught my eye this time was this chart :
Look at that chart .
The United States TODAY employs FEWER people to manufacture Non Durable Goods than we did during WWII !
And that ’s with a population that has grown from 130 million to over 306 million !
Or if you really want to compare the employment numbers with a figure , why not use the “ Civilian Noninstitutional Population ? ”
What ’s that ?
Of course Non Durable Goods Manufacturing would be things that are n’t built to last !
Where on earth do you suppose you would go to build those ?
China of course !
Sure , we are now a “ service economy . ”
We do n’t build things , we let others do that while we all cut each other ’s hair , do manicures , “ engineer ” financial products ( rob people ) , and blog for a living .
It ’s a terrific economy really , much better than Zimbabwe .
After all , China ’s still sending us their nondurable goods !
Least you think that jobs have only been lost in the nondurable goods jobs category , please take a look at the Durable Goods Manufacturing employment .
Much better there , we have only given up every single bit of employment growth there since about 1947 : Stunning .
Yes , when it comes to manufacturing in the United States , welcome back to 1940 my employment seeking friend :
But you know how bad the financial industry has taken it on the chin .
Let ’s take a look at employment in that field , they must be hurting as bad …
Oh .
Maybe not as much .
I ’m sure the geniuses at Goldman deserve that $ 700,000 average bonus for figuring out how to keep themselves employed while laying off the rest of working America which is exactly what has happened over the past 30 years .
And since we do n’t manufacture much of anything , we do n’t need as many employees to mine stuff , either .
Again , whatever we need we can get from overseas .
Good thing we can all flip burgers at McDonald ’s because the service industry employment is hanging tough : Would you like fries with that ?
But if you work in information services , you know , the high tech field of computers and the internet , it ’s a good thing you work in a stable and growing career field : Oops .
Sorry .
Do n’t worry , just write if you ’d like me to talk you through that short sale – it ’ll only affect your credit for a year or three .
It ’s a good thing that governments , like the State of California , are so fiscally healthy , I mean just look at all the employment growth there !
No slow down there !
YET .
But you can quote me on this , IT ’S COMING .
Of course we know that construction is also hurting ... just not as much as I would expect .
I think this is one area of employment that is still overdone .
Only back to the year 1998 ?
Not good enough !
We still have way too many houses , way too many strip malls , and way too many office buildings :
And , as to the myth that Americans work a 40 hour work week …
NOT ANY MORE .
Now 33 hours per week is average – yet another form of underemployment :
Look real hard , there ’s a green shoot at the end of that chart too .
No wonder stocks are priced at a P/E of 120 +!
As far as the percent of the population that ’s working ?
Never seen a better example of a head and shoulder ’s pattern !
I think Point showed us that one earlier , but here we are back to about 1978 :
The problem with this is that back in the ' 50s , '60s , and '70s most families only had one working person supporting the entire family .
Today it takes at least 10 just to support the necessary 8 computers , 4.5 cars , 18 cell phones , and $ 4 a gallon gasoline .
Not to mention all the other cheap nondurable goods made in China .
Yet , my point is that with that type of employment ratio we are back to the same raw numbers of workers as in the way back past .
That means that for every household today that has two fully employed workers , there is at least one houshold with NONE .
When it comes to the length of time spent on the unemployment payrolls , here we can finally see what the rally today was all about .
Just look at the chart showing civilians who were unemployed for 5 to 14 weeks .
A big drop , no doubt : But you ’re going to have no luck seeing ANY decline in the number of people unemployed for longer than 15 weeks : Nearly 8 million people !
Now look at this chart showing the number of civilians unemployed for 27 weeks or longer !
Yes , that 's 5 million people drawing benefits for that long or longer ...
And here 's the mean length of time of all those on unemployment :
Anyone else see a rising trend there ?
Maybe it 's just me , obviously all the other market participants are seeing something vastly different .
Do n’t worry about those who are in danger of running out of benefits after exhausting their 79 weeks worth though .
I understand that little Timmy Geithner is looking into extending those benefits even further ...
Of course the benefit to Timmy and the Bankers is that by giving 34 million Americans free food , and millions more pay for not working , is that they can still sit on the couch and watch the NFL which is coming back on television real soon !
I believe that is method number 3,366 in the central banker playbook , “ How to Placate an Entire Population so that they do n’t Hang You from the Nearest Tree . ”
I hear it ’s a best seller , and fortunately there are still plenty of employed financial engineers to keep the book sales up !
And this is why someday soon we will all be government employees who do nothing but cut each other ’s hair , “ engineer ” financial products , and blog .
Damn , I knew I should have moved to New York and found a job on Wall Street .
The Eagles – Life in the Fast Lane :
Today ’s topic :
What do you think of the theory that religious belief and experience are wired through evolution ?
Homo religious
Point : Michael Shermer
Did humans evolve to be religious and believe in God ?
In the most general sense , yes , we did .
Here ’s what happened .
Long ago , in an environment far away from the modern world , humans evolved to find meaningful causal patterns in nature to make sense of the world , and infuse many of those patterns with intentional agency , some of which became animistic spirits and powerful gods .
And as a social primate species , we also evolved social organizations designed to promote group cohesiveness and enforce moral rules .
People believe in God because we are pattern - seeking primates .
We connect A to B to C , and often A really is connected to B , and B really is connected to C .
This is called association learning .
But we do not have a false - pattern - detection device in our brains to help us discriminate between true and false patterns , and so we make errors in our thinking .
A Type I error is believing a pattern is real when it is not ( a false positive ) and a Type II error is not believing a pattern is real when it is ( a false negative ) .
Imagine you are a hominid on the planes of Africa and you hear a rustle in the grass .
Is it a dangerous predator or just the wind ?
If you assume it is a dangerous predator and it is just the wind , you have made a Type I error , but to no harm .
But if you believe the rustle in the grass is just the wind when it is a dangerous predator , there ’s a good chance you ’ll be lunch and thereby removed from your species ’ gene pool .
Thus , there would have been a natural selection for those hominids who tended to believe that all patterns are real and potentially dangerous .
I call this process “ patternicity ” ( the tendency to find meaningful patterns in random noise ) and “ agenticity ” ( the tendency to believe that the world is controlled by invisible intentional agents who may mean us harm ) .
This , I believe , is the basis for the belief in souls , spirits , ghosts , gods , demons , angels , aliens , intelligent designers , government conspiracy theorists and all manner of invisible agents intending to harm us or help us .
People are religious because we are social and we need to get along .
The moral sentiments in humans and moral principles in human groups evolved primarily through the force of natural selection operating on individuals , and secondarily through the force of group selection operating on populations .
The moral sense ( the psychological feeling of doing “ good ” in the form of positive emotions such as righteousness and pride ) evolved out of behaviors that were selected because they were good either for the individual or for the group .
An immoral sense ( the psychological feeling of doing “ bad ” in the form of negative emotions such as guilt and shame ) evolved out of behaviors that were selected because they were bad either for the individual or for the group .
While cultures may differ on what behaviors are defined as good or bad , the moral sense of feeling good or feeling bad about behavior X ( whatever X may be ) is an evolved human universal .
The codification of moral principles out of the psychology of the moral sentiments evolved as a form of social control to ensure the survival of individuals within groups and the survival of human groups themselves .
Religion was the first social institution to canonize moral principles , and God -- as an explanatory pattern for the world -- took on new powers as the ultimate enforcer of the rules .
Thus it is that people are religious and believe in God .

We die , therefore we are religious
Counterpoint : Francisco J. Ayala
The formal name of the human species is Homo sapiens , or “ knowing human . ”
As a consequence of evolution , ours is the most intelligent species on Earth .
A likely explanation of how our exalted intelligence came to be has to do with our ancestors of 2 million years ago , known as Homo habilis , who started to make very simple stone tools .
Making tools requires seeing such objects as “ tools , ” in other words , something to be used for a particular purpose : a knife for cutting , an arrow for hunting and so on .
Seeing something as a tool requires forming mental images of realities not present : the deer I ’ll seek to kill and the flesh I ’ll cut for eating .
In turn , forming mental images of things not present requires advanced intelligence , which is why so few animals make tools , and the tools they do make have n’t developed into anything resembling the advanced technologies of our species .
The evolution scenario suggests that those more intelligent among our remote ancestors were able to make better tools .
And those who made better tools survived better because they got more food and were more effective at killing their enemies or defending themselves .
Therefore , those more intelligent left more descendants , and genes for higher intelligence increased in frequency for thousands and thousands of years among our ancestors .
Our intelligence is curious :
We want to understand the world around us , how things happen and why they happen .
We seek causal explanations of natural events .
Before modern science came of age in the 17th century , humans attributed natural events for which they did not know the explanation to supernatural agents .
Spirits or gods caused rain and drought , floods and storms , earthquakes and volcanic eruptions , surely in retribution for human deeds .
These beliefs would often lead to worship and rituals .
Seeking causal explanations for events in the natural world was one source of religious beliefs and practices .
Humans live in complex societies , which need to be governed by laws and moral norms .
Seeking justification for moral norms and social laws was another source of religious faith and cults .
Israelites , for example , were told by Moses to observe the Ten Commandments because these were ordered by God .
But there is one more source of religion that also depends on our evolution - endowed intelligence : self - awareness and its consequence , death - awareness .
Except for young infants , every person is conscious of existing as a distinct individual , different from other people and from the environment .
Self - awareness is the most immediate and unquestionable reality of our experience .
Moreover , we humans are the only animals with full experience of self - awareness , which implies death - awareness .
If I know I exist as a distinct human individual , I know I will die because I see other people die .
Because we ceremonially bury our dead , we know humans are the only animals that are death - aware .
All human societies have burial rituals , although the rites are very diverse .
Ritual burial follows from death - awareness :
If I know I will die , I will treat other dead humans with such respect because I want to be treated this way when I die .
Because we humans are aware of the transitory character of our existence , we develop anxiety over death .
This anxiety is at least in part alleviated by religious beliefs and rituals , which give meaning to one ’s own life even though life will end .
Anxiety about death is further relieved in the many religions that attribute immortality to the soul , either through successive reincarnations or in the form of life beyond death .
Evolution , by making humans intelligent , predisposed us to be religious .

The progressive blogosphere cannot understand those who oppose funding Barack Obama 's domestic agenda by levying a surtax on the rich .
Rather than rehash the arguments against that plan , let me propose an alternative that should appeal to left and right alike : rather than raise taxes on the richest Americans , why not pass a law that freezes them out of receiving federal largess ?
Whether measured by income or net worth , those falling above a certain threshold could be means tested out of Social Security , Medicare , farm subsidies , the ability to deduct interest paid on their mortgage , federal higher education grants and subsidized loans for their children , NEA grants , vouchers to subsidize the cost of transitioning to digital televisions , etc .

Three Palestinian militants have been killed in an Israeli air strike on the Gaza Strip , officials say .
A military spokesman said the men were members of the militant group Islamic Jihad and were behind recent rocket attacks in the border town of Sderot .
The spokesman said they were killed as they prepared to launch further rockets into Israel from their vehicle .
Islamic Jihad say the men belonged to their group but were not on a rocket launching mission .
Israel carried out an offensive in December and January in the Gaza Strip which aimed to stop daily rocket attacks by militants on southern towns .
Palestinians and human rights groups say more than 1,400 Gazans were killed , but Israel puts the figure at 1,166 .
Three Israeli civilians and 10 Israeli soldiers were also killed .
Since the end of the campaign , Gaza militants have fired about 300 mortars into Israel , the Israeli military said .

Editor ’s note : YouTube has removed the video , likely at the behest of MSNBC .
Let ’s face it , Obama ’s propaganda talking heads at MSNBC hate the Constitution and the Bill of Rights .
David Shuster in particular hates the Constitution , as the clip below demonstrates .
He believes the Tenth Amendment is “ baloney ” — even as he utilizes the First to denounce it — and says Article I , Section .
8. , Clause 1 of the Constitution permits the government to confiscate the wealth of Americans for the purpose of Social Security , Medicare , and apparently for an oversized military that has initiated two invasions and occupations , adventures self - described liberals opposed when Bush was in office and support now that Obama is warming a seat in the Oval Office .
Shuster probably does not know it — because his primary role is to have perfect hair and read a teleprompter — but all taxes “ collected ” ( at gunpoint ) go for the interest on the staggering national debt ( over the $ 1.75 trillion officially reported for fiscal 2009 ) owed to a criminal gaggle of international bankers and not to the principle let alone government “ entitlement ” programs .
In the four years from January 2004 to January 2008 , the Medicare trustees reported that the unfunded liabilities of Social Security and Medicare grew by a stunning $ 10.4 trillion .
The average annual growth topped $ 2.5 trillion .
Here ’s something else Shuster the smirking teleprompter reader did not tell you — much of the money collected by the government at gunpoint is spent elsewhere , not on Social Security .
It ’s all funny money to the criminals on Capitol Hill — and they ’ll keep stealing from you so long as you let them .
Constitutional scholar Michael Badnarik on the 10th Amdendment .
Shuster hates the Tenth Amendment because it reaffirms the once well understood principle that powers not granted to the United States were reserved to the States or to the people .
“ The issue of power – and especially the great potential for a power struggle between the federal and the state governments – was extremely important to the America ’s founders .
They deeply distrusted government power , and their goal was to prevent the growth of the type of government that the British has exercised over the colonies , ” explains the Tenth Amendment Center .
“ It ’s quite clear that the Tenth Amendment was written to emphasize the limited nature of the powers delegated to the federal government .
In delegating just specific powers to the federal government , the states and the people , with some small exceptions , were free to continue exercising their sovereign powers … .
Adherence to the Tenth Amendment is the first step towards ensuring liberty in the United States .
Liberty through decentralization . ”
[ efoods ]
Shuster and the Operation Mockingbird intellectuals and teleprompter readers loathe the idea of decentralized government and that ’s why they hate the Tenth Amendment .
For them , a perfect world is one where a leviathan federal government micromanages the lives of all its subjects the same way it did in the former Soviet Union or still does in North Korea and other totalitarian hell holes .
It ’s now to the point where state - loving intellectuals can openly mock the Constitution and the Bill of Rights on television .
But then that ’s precisely what Shuster ’s bosses want — incessant propaganda deriding the idea of individual rights and responsibilities in favor of a suffocating ( and ultimately murderous ) nanny state and an all - powerful central government complete with a repressive state police apparatus like the one in East Germany .
David Shuster is merely doing the bidding of the global elite who are determined to reduce humanity to slaves and ultimately cull the herd to the more manageable number of 500 million .
In order to realize this nightmare , they have to destroy not only the Constitution but eradicate any remembrance or understanding of it .
That ’s where Shuster and his fellows come into play .
It ’s up to them to snidely deride the concept of individual liberty .
As the gathering in Washington D.C. today reveals , the elite and their crop of sarcastic teleprompter readers have a lot of work cut out for them .
Increasing numbers of Americans now realize the federal government is a deadly leviathan and they want it brought to heel , as the founders insisted .
On the day we get our country back , the traitors will be brought to answer for their crimes .
David Shuster will be among them .

The symptoms of our planetary fever are becoming more obvious with each passing year .
Now a place that has been locked in solid ice since our ancestors were swinging from the trees is turning to liquid , way ahead of previous scientific predictions .
Robert Corell , one of America 's leading climate scientists , warns : " If you want to see what will happen to the rest of the world , look to the Arctic .
It happens there first . "
Our heat is what is turning it into a landscape that we can no longer recognise .
If humans continue emitting warming gases at the current rate , this will happen in most places – with rising oceans , dried - out and dying agricultural lands , and far more extreme weather events .
The speed with which this is happening suggests it wo n't just happen to the grandchildren and polar bears politicians keep evoking in speeches .
It will happen to us .
The world 's climate scientists are warning that in my lifetime , we could be on course for five degrees of warming .
That 's a gap as big as that between the way we live now , and the last ice age .
It will change our planet to one we do n't understand , and cannot inhabit in anything like our current numbers .

This year , there is a chance – at five minutes to ecological midnight – to change course .
The world 's leaders will meet in Copenhagen to agree a successor to Kyoto .
If they resolve to make substantial and binding cuts , we could keep the ecosystem the right side of the tipping point , beyond which it will collapse .
But it has to happen now .
Anything you do in the next few months to pressure your politicians – marching and campaigning and volunteering for Greenpeace or Friends of the Earth – may be the most important thing you ever do .
But many people concerned about this catastrophic global warming are systematically misdirecting their political energies .
They are taking their anxieties and ploughing them exclusively into cutting their own personal emissions .
This is , at best , of very limited value , and at worst a placebo that stops you from reaching for the real medicine .
The only thing that will keep our climate within safe parameters is mass public pressure on our politicians to agree binding restrictions that apply to all of us – not just the nice 10 percent who will voluntarily cut back .
The time for that pressure is now .

If population continues to rise , but resource availability declines , we could be headed for disaster .
It 's not a question of whether Michelle Duggar and her husband can care for another child .
The bigger , and more urgent , question is , " Can our planet handle an additional 2.5 billion humans by mid-century ? "
As Americans , we have been raised to believe that bigger is always better .
And maybe that 's why " 18 kids and Counting " has been such popular show .
But in a world beset by critical environmental challenges and a shrinking resource base , bigger is not better .
It is , in fact , a whole lot worse .
Winona Daily News
The Duggars are producing responsible , well - trained , happy children with IQs over 120 .
The third world will produce more than ten times as many children , but they 'll have IQs in the mid to low 90s , be impoverished , uneducated and probably hate the rest of us for having more than they .
Perhaps the future of avoiding overpopulation is more Michelle Duggar and less third world aid .
I realize you cannot mention this in your article because it 's taboo , but being dishonest has always caused humanity problems , do n't you agree ?
Journalist Robert Walker was describing the overpopulation problem :
And here 's my reply : I guess my point to Mr. Walker is this -- most human endeavors on this earth fail , so why do we get upset if one of the ones that 's succeeding breeds a little more ?
Is n't that how we got here , the smart prosperous apes outbreeding the slackers ?
Well , let 's not panic and drop the phone .
Stop third world aid .
Stop aid to the impoverished .
Keep encouraging the Duggars and their ilk to have as many kids as they want .
The IQ and health of the average human being on earth will keep rising that way .
One year after Hurricane Ike tore across the gulf coast of Texas , residents paused on Sunday to observe the anniversary of the costliest natural disaster in Texas history .
Destroying or damaging many thousands of houses , including 3 / 4 of all homes in Galveston , Ike 's 110 mph winds caused more than $ 29 billion in damage , and took the lives of at least 72 in the United States .
In Galveston one year later , 75 % of businesses have reopened , much of the debris has been cleared , and 95 % of the population has returned , but much work still remains to be done as residents continue to rebuild and recover .

Harvester is a data acquisition component at Yahoo !
that acquires data from various providers concurrently through a pull model from drop boxes via various protocols .
Feeds can either be scheduled or fetched on demand .
While Harvester was originally written in Perl , Erlang 's high - level concurrency constructs -- along with OTP design principles -- make it an ideal platform for building reliable , fault tolerant , and scalable applications like Harvester .
The resulting service is more scalable , available , reliable , and able to comply with tighter service - level agreements ( SLA ) on a lighter code base and less expensive development efforts .
In this article , we compare how the two systems perform side - by - side on a single box and showcase the higher ROI provided by the Erlang stack .
Harvester is modeled as a set of cooperating Perl processes .
A Perl daemon ( foreman ) monitors a queue in the database for feeds that are scheduled to run .
The foreman launches worker processes when a feed is ready for a fetch .
A separate Perl daemon ( conductor ) schedules jobs into the queue .
For scalability and high availability , all nodes run the foreman and conductor .
To avoid concurrency problems , they use named locks in the database to avoid stepping on each other .
Figure 1 presents a high - level architectural view of a queued batch processing system such as this .
The advantages of this approach include :
Since each process is well isolated , a crash does not affect other processes .
It scales horizontally reasonably well .
There is no single point of failure ( except the database ) .
Still , the current design has limited Harvester 's adoption in areas such as mission - critical feeds with strict SLA .
These drawbacks include :
Perl processes are heavy , each taking almost three seconds to load .
Resource usage per feed is high .
Upgrades were extremely tricky given the nature of feeds running on the system .
Load balancing across processes was skewed by proximity of write master .
SLA misses under peak loads because of a combination of above - mentioned factors
Extracting More From the Current Implementation
To address these drawbacks , we took several steps , starting with tweaking the existing architecture with pooled Perl processes .
We hoped this would reduce the process launch times by pooling worker processes that were launched , reusing it for the next run .
However , the resource usage was still high per process .
Considering that the processes are mostly I/O intensive , the huge number of spawned process meant neither the CPU nor the I/O was being effectively utilized and the OS was spending more time in process switching .
Moreover , the database contention still remains .
Bringing in a job management system into the architecture meant more maintenance overhead with no significant returns on resource utilization .
Threads in Perl were explored for more efficient resource utilization but not advised by the gurus .
Stepping back we realized that the requirements were of a broader nature .
We realized that what we needed was a :
Programming model that simplified parallel processing .
Well - tested distributed programming model for scaling horizontally .
Reliable and guaranteed error handling mechanism .
Framework that allowed code upgrades with no downtime .
Efficient use of modern multicore commodity hardware .
Easily integrate with the existing software stack at Yahoo !.
With this in mind , we considered a Java solution .
The Java stack has a very good threading model , which has been proven in the field .
However , mapping our problem to the Java application server model like Tomcat was not a natural fit because Harvester :
Is not a web - app .
Does a lot of network calls from within the container .
Has a lot of long running calls .
Building it as a stand - alone threaded Java app would mean introducing the issues associated with the threaded programming model .
The threading model is based on shared memory and locking to achieve consistency .
Developing and deploying an error - free threaded program is tough , since hard - to - reproduce concurrency issues go hand - in - hand with shared memory .
A message passing solution is not native to Java and we would need to bring in an external library to help us do messaging , in turn introducing a performance impact .
Also , current Java VM's are not well - suited for the new range of hardware sporting more cores and lower clock speeds .
The code upgrade issue still remains and doing application upgrades involve taking a host down , upgrading it , and putting it back into the cluster .
A few years ago , I had the bizarre pleasure of watching the University of Michigan football team handily defeat Indiana University 's in Bloomington , IN .
I say bizarre because victory rings just a bit hollow in a half - empty stadium after a 34 - 3 smackdown .
The win felt inevitable and when it was , relief rather than joy was the emotion of the hour .
The experience did , however , provide my friends and me with a long - running inside joke .
Before opposing third downs , the stadium 's sound system began playing the intro to AC / DC's " Hell 's Bells " while the announcer - in his straight - laced announcer voice - belted , " Heyyyyy Hoosier fans , it 's THIRRRRRRD down ! "
The small crowd predictably did n't respond , and the whole ploy came off as a cheesy attempt to induce a legitimate game atmosphere .
A week later , in Ohio State 's Ohio Stadium , the same song came on during third downs - minus the hilariously dissonant announcer - only to be drowned out by the 90,000 - plus fans already yelling at the field .
My friend and I looked at each other when it came on , laughing at the Indiana memory and wondering why the booth at the already - imposing stadium felt the need to pipe in tunes .
I 've been to over 20 different sports venues in my life , and all but two of them , Michigan Stadium and Yost Ice Arena ( Michigan 's hockey arena ) , used music over the loudspeakers to get the crowd into games .
I have almost never seen it work .
Some venues ( the Detroit Red Wings ' Joe Louis Arena is probably the best example ) throw so many different song clips that the fans seem confused by the music cues .
During my visit to Joe Louis , the crowd started to get loud at a critical moment in the game .
When the hapless booth tried to build on the noise with some generic 80s hair metal , the crowd froze , seemingly unsure of what to do , and by the time play started back up , the crowd 's energy had been converted into timid silence .
For what it 's worth , the opposing team almost immediately scored a game - tying goal .
They would eventually win in overtime .
Nicely done , booth operators .
One of my favorite things about Michigan Stadium has always been its gimmick - free approach to the game day experience .
College football is separated from most other American sports by the sheer age of its traditions - its rivalries can go back over a century , and its mammoth stadiums often predate the existence of the NFL .
Walking into Michigan Stadium is like stepping back into 1948 , 1969 , or 1997 .
There are no ads on the stadium walls .
The scoreboard does n't look all that new .
Even the brand new luxury boxes look like they 've been there for ages , and they 're not even done yet .
It 's an exercise in living in the past , the present , and the future .
I hope that in 2029 , my children 's experience with Michigan football is fundamentally the same .
Recently , for the first time , Michigan Stadium began playing the occasional piped - in song during the game .
It had been a point of pride among a population of Michigan fans that noise during the game comes from two places : the marching band and fans themselves .
It fits with the stripped - down , hand - me - down tradition of the program .
We are n't the consistently loudest fans in college football , but we at least know when we need to cheer .
The moments that have given me chills , the earth - shaking crowd reactions that sear a sports moment into your head , are not spurred by a booth operator 's clever song choice .
They are the first play of a Michigan - Ohio State game , where no music on earth could compete with the roar of the crowd .
It 's the final play of last year 's Texas - Texas Tech game .
Sometimes piped - in music can be powerful , when it 's employed as a tradition , for instance .
If you were making a case for outside music , exhibit A would probably be the bloodcurdling , rock - your - fucking - face - off entrance at Virginia Tech .
Wisconsin's " Jump Around " is one of the most fun traditions around , and Penn State 's quaking Zombie Nation made me think I was actually going to fall out of the stadium .
But in these rare instances , the music is n't taking over as filler , it is a signature .
When Michigan beat Penn State in 2007 , the Michigan student section began jumping up and down , singing " Zombie Nation " and replaced the words " We are Penn State " with " We own Penn State . "
That 's what we associate with them .
At any rate , those are sounds that would happen regardless .
Most piped - in music tries to keep the fans attuned or get them loud when they are n't reacting .
It 's built as much for Ohio State third downs as the fourth quarter of a 55 - 0 beating of Eastern Michigan .
And that 's what kills me .
Before last week , Michigan Stadium was possibly the least sanitized venue in sports .
We may not be loud all the time , but when we are it means something .
The truth is we should n't be getting loud at the end of a 55 - 0 blowout .
That 's not our identity and there 's no need for it .
There are amazing moments unperturbed by sound , though , that will always stick with me and could have only happened in Michigan Stadium where the band knows not to intrude .
They are n't good moments .
It 's the crowd so quiet that I could hear the final kick get blocked when we lost to Appalachian State .
It 's the sickness in my stomach that was ratcheted up by the silence of 110,000 as Ohio State marched for a come - from - behind victory in 2005 .
That silence , awful as it was , is a beautiful if troubling memory .
Music could have easily ruined it .
Sports are as much about the raucous , glorious highs as about the sickening , quiet lows .
But when you overcome that tension , when the silence of fear becomes the frenzy of victory , you get something pure like the end of Penn State or the 17 - point comeback against Michigan State .
Those moments are dictated by people ; not the decisions of some silly booth operator .
Please , Athletic Department , keep the tradition alive and leave the piped - in music to the others .
At $ 199 , it is still about $ 100 too expensive .
I recognize it is the undisputed winner of the console sales this generation , but when Nintendo can still make a tidy profit at a hundred bucks a pop , they should go ahead and sell it at that price .
That said , I suspect they will sell a bunch of them at the two hundred dollar price point , so their marketing folks should ignore my worthless thoughts on the subject .
Besides , they will need that extra profit for R&D to come up with their next generation gimmick to kick Sony and Microsoft 's butt again .

GUN killer Tremayne Durham gave up his right to trial - for a bucket of fried chicken .
Durham , 33 , had been preparing to go to trial for murdering a man over a business deal worth £ 9000 .
But after two years in a US county jail on prison food , he agreed to admit his guilt in return for two junkfood feasts .
Durham , from New York , got the first - a mix of food from KFC and rival food chain Popeyes , including chicken , potatoes , coleslaw , cake and ice cream - when he signed his plea deal .
After he was told he must serve at least 30 years before parole , he tucked into his second course .
Durham , a convicted rapist who could have faced the death penalty if he'd been found guilty at a trial , this time had pizza , lasagne and ice cream , according to his lawyer Richard Wolf .
Durham also got married on Wednesday at the courthouse in Portland , Oregon , before his sentencing .
His bride Vanessa Davis , 48 , is on parole for witness tampering in the case .
Wolf described the civil ceremony as " bitter - sweet " .
Prosecutor Josh Lamborn said he did not advocate chicken - dinner deals .
But he applauded Judge Eric Bergstrom 's decision to allow the deal in the case of Durham , who also gave up his right to appeal .
The killer travelled across America to seek revenge when he tried to back out of a deal to buy an ice - cream van from an Oregon firm and they refused to return his money .
He killed Adam Calbreath , a former employee of the company , while looking for the owner , Rob Chambers .
Don Hons , a friend of Adam , said he was glad that the judge made the deal to ensure Durham was locked up for life .
He added : " If a couple of buckets of chicken are going to help to get a conviction , get some biscuits to go with it . "
Until now , there have been two known types of black holes : stellar - mass black holes that are several times more massive than our sun and are created when really big stars die out , and supermassive black holes that are millions to billions of times the mass of the sun and which sit in the center of most , maybe all , galaxies , including our own Milky Way .
While astrophysicists have been fairly certain of how the smaller black holes are created , the creation of the larger ones has been largely a mystery .
The main hypothesis is that they are formed from the merger of multiple medium - size black holes .
But no one had ever confirmed the existence of black holes of this size .
Until this week .
A team led by scientists at the Centre d'Etude Spatiale des Rayonnements in France reports in today 's issue of Nature that they have found a black hole that is more than 500 times more massive than the sun .
They found an X - ray source , now named Hyper - Luminous X - ray source 1 ( HLX - 1 ) , on the edge of the galaxy ESO 243 - 49 that has a maximum X - ray brightness about 260 million times that of the sun .
As gas falls into a black hole , energy is released , much of it in the form of X - rays .
Only a medium - size black hole could create an X - ray signature that bright , the scientists say .
" This is the best detection to date of such long sought after intermediate mass black holes , " lead author Sean Farrell said in a statement .
" Such a detection is essential .
While it is already known that stellar - mass black holes are the remnants of massive stars , the formation mechanisms of supermassive black holes are still unknown .
The identification of HLX - 1 is therefore an important step towards a better understanding of the formation of the supermassive black holes that exist at the center of the Milky Way and other galaxies . "
WHO IS JESUS CHRIST ?
Since Jesus Christ ( Yeshua Ha'Mashiach ) walked this earth as a human 2,000 years ago , there has been a controversy over who he really was .
The Bible tells us in many places that there is only one true God ( Deu . 6:4 ; Mal. 2:10 ; Mark 12:32 ; Rom. 3:30 ; Jam. 2:19 ; etc. ) .
So where does Yeshua fit into the Godhead ?
Most modern Christians have been taught that Jesus is the second co-equal " person " in a triune Godhead composed of God the Father , God the Son , and God the Holy Spirit .
However , many ( if not most ) Christians do n't really understand the Trinity .
Other believers today , perceiving problems with the Trinity doctrine , have adopted a belief in the " Oneness " of God which is similar to the ancient doctrine of Modalism .
Before we can truly understand who the Messiah is , we need to look at the historical background of 1st - century Jewish religion and subsequent philosophical / religious doctrines that arose to explain his identity .
This article is going to examine the beliefs of 1st - century Jews regarding the Godhead and present the succeeding theories put forth to define who Yeshua is .
The second part of this study will conclude by harmonizing the Scriptures with this information to better understand what the Bible really says about the identity of the Messiah .
First , let 's start by looking at what 1st - century CE Jewish religion believed about the Godhead .
There has been a tendency by scholars to define 1st - century orthodox monotheistic Judaism in rather restrictive terms .
Jewish literature or beliefs from that time frame that seem to stray from the accepted norm have been reinterpreted to accommodate Trinitarianism or used to prove that Judaism was derived from the polytheistic religions surrounding Israel .
Regarding how modern scholars tend to view 1st - century Jewish religion as either totally monotheistic or essentially polytheistic , University of Manitoba Professor Larry W. Hurtado wrote :
I suggest that on both sides of the issue . . . there has been a tendency to proceed deductively from a priori presumptions of what monotheism must mean , instead of building up a view inductively from the evidence of how monotheism actually operated in the thought and practice of ancient Jews .
There seems to be an implicit agreement on both sides that more than one transcendent being of any significance complicates or constitutes a weakening of or threat to monotheism .
Those who see first - century Jewish religion as monotheistic tend , therefore , to downplay the significance and attributes given by ancient Jews to any transcendent beings other than God .
For these scholars often , ancient Jewish monotheism must mean that the descriptions of such beings are largely rhetorical .
Though I am convinced regarding some examples , I am not sure that the descriptions are always purely rhetoric . . .
Those on the other side of the issue tend to emphasize the honorific ways in which transcendent beings other than God are described and the prominent positions they occupy in the religious conceptions reflected in ancient Jewish texts , alleging that first - century Jews were not really monotheists after all .
It is clear that ancient Jews were not characteristically monists or unitarians , but does this mean that they were not monotheists ?
That is , on both sides there is a tendency to proceed as if we can know in advance what " monotheism " must mean , which turns out to be a very modern , monistic form of monotheism , and can accordingly evaluate ancient Jewish texts and beliefs as to whether or how closely they meet an a priori standard of " pure " monotheism .
( " What Do We Mean by ' First - Century Jewish Monotheism ' ? , " Journal for the Study of the New Testament )
As the above quote shows , Professor Hurtado believes that most modern scholars have a skewed view of 1st - century Jewish monotheism because they evaluate the ancient Jewish writings with a preconceived idea of what monotheism should look like .
He continues :
I urge us to work more inductively , gathering what " monotheism " is on the ground , so to speak , from the evidence of what self - professed monotheists believe and practice .
In fact , I suggest that for historical investigation our policy should be to take people as monotheistic if that is how they describe themselves , in spite of what we might be inclined to regard at first as anomalies in their beliefs .
Such " anomalies , " I suggest in fact are extremely valuable data in shaping our understanding of monotheism out of the actual beliefs of actual people and traditions who describe themselves in monotheistic language .
( Ibid . )
In another of his works on this topic , Professor Hurtado states :
. . .
The cultic veneration of Jesus as a divine figure apparently began among Jewish Christians , whose religious background placed great emphasis upon the uniqueness of God .
It is evident that their devotion had its own distinctive shape , a kind of binitarian reverence which included both God and the exalted Jesus .
Also it is obvious that these Christians did not have the benefit of the prolonged and intricate developments and discussions that led to the theology reflected in the Nicene Creed and that one must refrain from reading these later developments back into the earlier period . . . ( p. 11 , One God , One Lord )
To find out what 1st - century Jews believed about God and His " only begotten Son " Yeshua , this article will examine several sources .
We will begin with the Targums , which were widely accepted Aramaic paraphrases of the Hebrew Scriptures read in the synagogues along with the Hebrew texts .
Aramaic is believed to have largely replaced Hebrew as the common language of the Jews in Judea before the time of Christ .
Regarding the Targums , The Eerdmans Bible Dictionary states :
The extant written Targums had their beginnings with the oral rendering into the Aramaic vernacular of portions of the Hebrew Bible that took place as part of the regular worship in synagogues during the centuries when the Jews of Palestine and Babylonia spoke dialects of Aramaic ( cf. Ezra 8:7 - 8 ) .
While the origins of this practice in the synagogues are pre-Christian , the growth of the Targum traditions continued for centuries and have been preserved in written compositions that are not only the product of synagogue liturgy , but of the rabbinic academies as well .
. . .
With study of newly discovered and identified materials has come a reevaluation of the significance of the Targums for the understanding of Judaism in the milieu of Jesus and his first followers .
Since the Targums originated in the synagogue , they are likely to be the best testimony to popular forms of early Judaism that were the preserve of special groups .
While this point and the pre-Christian origin of the practice of oral translation in the synagogue services are generally acknowledged by scholars , the further claim that some of the extant written Targums are as a whole pre-Christian is vigorously debated .
( pp. 984-985 , " Targum " )
Within the Targums , we find frequent reference to the Word ( Ara. Memra ) of YHVH .
Generally , in biblical passages where YHVH is seen , or where the text indicates that more than one " God " is being referred to , the Targums will often replace ' elohim or YHVH with " the Word of the LORD . "
GENESIS 3:8
And they heard the sound of the LORD God [ YHVH ' elohim ] walking in the garden in the cool of the day , and Adam and his wife hid themselves from the presence of the LORD God among the trees of the garden .
( NKJV )
GENESIS 3:8
And they heard the voice of the Word of the Lord God walking in the garden in the repose of the day ; and Adam and his wife hid themselves from before the Lord God among the trees of the garden .
( Targum Pseudo - Jonathan , translated by J.W. Etheridge )
EXODUS 20:1 And God [ ' elohim ] spoke all these words , saying : ( NKJV )
EXODUS 20:1
And the Word of the Lord spake all the excellency of these words saying : ( Jerusalem Targum , translated by J.W. Etheridge )
EXODUS 29:42 " This shall be a continual burnt offering throughout your generations at the door of the tabernacle of meeting before the LORD , where I will meet you to speak with you .
43
And there I will meet with the children of Israel , and the tabernacle shall be sanctified by My glory . "
( NKJV )
EXODUS 29:42
A perpetual holocaust for your generations at the door of the tabernacle of ordinance before the Lord ; where I will appoint My Word to ( meet ) thee there , to speak with thee there .
43 And there I will appoint My Word ( to meet ) with the sons of Israel , and I will be sanctified in their rulers for My glory .
( Targum Pseudo - Jonathan , translated by J.W. Etheridge )
DEUTERONOMY 4:20 " But the LORD [ YHVH ] has taken you and brought you out of the iron furnace , out of Egypt , to be His people , an inheritance , as you are this day . "
( NKJV )
DEUTERONOMY 4:20
For you hath the Word of the Lord taken for His portion , and hath brought you out from the iron furnace of Mizraim to be unto
Him a people of inheritance as at this day .
( Jerusalem Targum , translated by J.W. Etheridge )
DEUTERONOMY 4:24 " For the LORD your God [ YHVH ' eloheykha ] is a consuming fire , a jealous God [ 'el ] . ( NKJV )
DEUTERONOMY 4:24 For the Word of the Lord your God is a consuming fire ; the jealous God is a fire , and He avengeth Himself in jealousy .
( Targum Pseudo - Jonathan , translated by J.W. Etheridge )
DEUTERONOMY 6:20 " When your son asks you in time to come , saying , ' What is the meaning of the testimonies , the statutes , and the judgments which the LORD our God [ YHVH ' eloheynu ] has commanded you ? ' 21 then you shall say to your son :
' We were slaves of Pharaoh in Egypt , and the LORD [ YHVH ] brought us out of Egypt with a mighty hand ; 22 and the LORD [ YHVH ] showed signs and wonders before our eyes , great and severe , against Egypt , Pharaoh , and all his household .
23 Then
He brought us out from there , that He might bring us in , to give us the land of which He swore to our fathers .
24 And the LORD [ YHVH ] commanded us to observe all these statutes , to fear the LORD our God [ YHVH ' eloheynu ] , for our good always , that He might preserve us alive , as it is this day .
( NKJV )
DEUTERONOMY 6:20
When thy son , in time to come , shall ask thee , saying , What are the testimonies , statutes , and judgments which the Lord our God hath commanded you ?
21 then shall you say to your sons ,
We were servants to Pharoh in Mizraim , and the Word of the Lord brought us out of Mizraim with a mighty hand ; 22 and the Word of the Lord wrought signs , great wonders , and sore plagues on Mizraim and on Pharoh and all the men of his house , which our eyes beheld ; but us He led forth free to bring us in and give us the land which He sware to our fathers .
And the Lord commanded us to perform all these statutes , that we may fear the Lord our God for good to us in all days , that He may preserve us alive as at the time of this day ; ( Targum Pseudo - Jonathan , translated by J.W. Etheridge )
As shown above , the Targums often replaced YHVH with the Word of YHVH in order to clarify difficult or misunderstood passages .
This shows that Israel anciently understood there to be two divine beings over their nation , with the subordinate one being the spokesman and mediator for the higher .
This Jewish understanding of the Godhead is reflected in The Wisdom of Sirach .
This literary work ( also called Ecclesiasticus ) was originally written in Hebrew sometime around 180 BCE .
The grandson of the author rendered the book into Greek about 132 BCE to make it available to Diaspora Jews .
One passage in particular clearly points out the ancient understanding that the Most High God had a divine Son who was recognized by the Jews :
SIRACH 51:10 I appealed to the Lord , the Father of my lord , not to forsake me in the days of affliction , at the time when there is no help against the proud .
( RSV )
This passage clearly differentiates between Sirach 's lord and the Father of Sirach 's lord ( the Most High ) .
This Jewish work was written about two centuries before Christ 's ministry ; clearly Sirach believed that there were two " Lords " over Israel .
This passage is very similar to David 's introduction to Psalm 110 :
PSALM 110:1
The LORD said to my Lord , " Sit at My right hand , till I make Your enemies Your footstool . "
( NKJV )
Here , David shows the Most High God 's promise to David 's Lord to grant him authority over his enemies .
We know from Yeshua 's own exposition of this passage that he equated himself with David 's Lord ( Matt .
22:41-46 ; Mark 12:35 - 37 ; Luke 20:41 - 44 ) .
Both Sirach 51:10 and Psalm 110:1 show that there was an ancient recognition of the fact that the Most High God had delegated authority over His portion , Israel ( Deu. 32:9 ) to a subordinate , identified by Sirach as God 's Son.
Sirach 's understanding is verified by the New Testament use of Psalm 110:1 to refer to the " only begotten Son " of God , Jesus Christ ( Acts 2:34 - 36 ; Heb. 1:13 ) .
The apostle Paul wrote something similar in his first epistle to the Corinthians :
I CORINTHIANS 8:5
For even if there are so - called gods , whether in heaven or on earth ( as there are many gods and many lords ) , 6 yet for us there is one God , the Father , of whom are all things , and we for Him ; and one Lord Jesus Christ , through whom are all things , and through whom we live .
( NKJV )
In all these writings , we see that there are two " Gods " ( Heb. ' elohim ) over Israel .
For Sirach , there was ( 1 ) the Lord , the Father of ( 2 ) his Lord .
David records ( 1 ) the LORD speaking to ( 2 ) his Lord .
Paul tells us of one ( 1 ) God and one ( 2 ) Lord .
Each of these examples shows us that two entities were understood to be present .
There is another Scripture in the Tanakh that clearly shows the ancient Israelites knew that the Most High God had a special , unique Son :
PROVERBS 30:4
Who has ascended into heaven , or descended ?
Who has gathered the wind in His fists ?
Who has bound the waters in a garment ?
Who has established all the ends of the earth ?
What is His name , and what is His Son 's name , if you know ?
5 Every word of God [ ' Eloah ] is pure ;
He is a shield to those who put their trust in Him . ( NKJV )
The passage above from Proverbs shows that God 's status as Father and the fact that He had an incomparable Son was recognized by the Israelites .
This " firstborn son " is the one known to the ancient Israelites as the " Angel of the Lord , " YHVH , the " Word ( Ara. Memra , Gr. Logos ) of YHVH , " and many other names .
This Son is the one who became Yeshua the Messiah .
Next , we 're going to examine the writings of Philo Judaeus .
He lived from around 20 BCE to 50 CE and was a leader of the Jewish community in Alexandria , Egypt .
Being a contemporary of Yeshua , his expositions on Judaism should be very helpful in understanding the context within which Christianity was born .
However , because his writings differ from the doctrines that the Jewish rabbis later promoted , he has rarely been used to understand the framework of beliefs within 1st - century Judaism .
Philo is often somewhat erroneously referred to as a Greek scholar whose literature combined Judaism , Greek philosophy , and allegory in a Neoplatonic fashion .
First and foremost , however , Philo was a Jew .
Although he endeavored to explain the historical religion of his people using Greek philosophical concepts familiar in the Hellenistic world of his day , a close reading of Philo 's works reveal that he was not espousing Greek philosophy .
Rather , Philo described the Jewish religion of his day in Greek terms , and what he described was Judaism and not a paganized hybrid .
Even though Philo's Judaism differs considerably from that which we see today , his literature echoes much of what was shortly thereafter written by the Jewish composers of the New Testament .
Philo speaks often of the Word ( Logos ) , a Greek philosophical term which was later applied to Yeshua by the apostle John ( John 1:1 , 14 ; I John 1:1 ; Rev. 19:13 ) .
Greek philosopher Heraclitus was the first to advance a theory about the Logos .
To him , the Logos ( which he appeared to identify with fire ) was the universal principle which animated and governed the world .
The Greek Stoics later developed the concept of the Logos further .
They believed that the Logos was both an irresistible force which sustained the entire world and a holy law which every rational man should willingly follow .
The fact that both Philo and John used an existing Greek term with pagan philosophical overtones does not mean that they were accepting the Greek understanding of Logos .
Scholar Harry A. Wolfson says this about the Jewish appropriation of such concepts :
With the example of Scripture before them ( the Jews ) were not afraid to make use in the description of their own religion of terms used in the description of other religions , but whatever common terms they used the difference was never blurred for them between truth and falsehood in religious belief and right and wrong in religious worship .
For the understanding of the nature of Judaism throughout its history , and especially during the Hellenistic period , this twofold aspect of its attitude to other religions is of the utmost importance .
Those who seem to see evidence of religious syncretization in every use of a pagan term by a Hellenistic Jew simply overlook this one important aspect in the attitude of Judaism toward other religions .
( p. 10 , vol .
I , Philo : Foundations of Religious Philosophy in Judaism , Christianity and Islam )
An examination of some of Philo 's comments on the Logos sheds light on how 1st - century Jews understood this concept .
Let 's now take a detailed look at what Philo wrote about the Logos , and compare it to similar passages from the New Testament :
Now the image of God is the Word [ Logos ] , by which all the world was made .
( p. 541 , The Works of Philo , " The Special Laws , I , " translated by C.D. Yonge )
II CORINTHIANS 4:4 . . .
Christ , who is the image of God . . . ( NKJV )
JOHN 1:3
All things were made through Him [ Christ ] , and without Him nothing was made that was made .
( NKJV )
HEBREWS 1:1 God , who at various times and in various ways spoke in time past to the fathers by the prophets , 2 has in these last days spoken to us by His Son , whom He has appointed heir of all things , through whom also
He made the worlds ; ( NKJV )
And even if there be not as yet any one who is worthy to be called a son of God , nevertheless let him labour earnestly to be adorned according to His first - born Word [ Logos ] , the eldest of His angels , as the great archangel of many names ; for he is called , the Authority , and the Name of God , and the Word [ Logos ] , and Man according to God 's image , and He who sees Israel .
( p. 247 , The Works of Philo , " On the Confusion of Tongues , " translated by C.D. Yonge )
COLOSSIANS 1:15 [ Messiah ] who is the image of the God who is not seen and the firstborn of all created ones .
( Magiera NT Peshitta translation )
For as those who are not able to look upon the sun itself , look upon the reflected rays of the sun as the sun itself , and upon the halo around the moon as if it were the moon itself ; so also do those who are unable to bear the sight of God , look upon
His image , His angel Word [ Logos ] , as Himself .
( p. 386 , The Works of Philo , " On Dreams , I , " translated by C.D. Yonge )
JOHN 1:18
No one has seen God at any time .
The only begotten Son , who is in the bosom of the Father , He has declared Him . ( NKJV )
HEBREWS 1:3
Who being the brightness of His glory and the express image of His person , and upholding all things by the word of His power , when he had by himself purged our sins , sat down at the right hand of the Majesty on high , ( NKJV )
Why is it that He speaks as if of some other god , saying that He made man after the image of God , and not that He made man after His own image ?
( Genesis 9:6 )
Very appropriately and without any falsehood was this oracular sentence uttered by God , for no mortal thing could have been formed on the similitude of the supreme Father of the universe , but only after the pattern of the second deity , who is the Word [ Logos ] of the supreme Being . . . ( p. 834 , The Works of Philo , " Questions and Answers on Genesis , II , " translated by C.D. Yonge )
. . .
The shadow of God is His Word [ Logos ] , which He used like an instrument when He was making the world .
And this shadow , and , as it were , model , is the archetype of other things .
For , as God is Himself the model of that image which He has now called a shadow , so also that image is the model of other things , as he showed when he commenced giving the law to the Israelites , and said , " And God made man according to the image of God [ Gen. 1:26 ] . "
As the image was modelled according to God , and as man was modelled according to the image , which thus received the power and character of the model .
( p. 61 , The Works of Philo , " Allegorical Interpretation , III , " translated by C.D. Yonge )
GENESIS 1:27 So God [ ' elohim ] created man in His own image ; in the image of God [ ' elohim ]
He created him ; male and female He created them .
( NKJV )
GENESIS 1:27
And the Word of the Lord created man in His likeness , in the likeness of the presence of the Lord He created him , the male and his yoke - fellow He created them .
( Jerusalem Targum , translated by J.W. Etheridge )
And the Father who created the universe has given to His archangelic and most ancient Word [ Logos ] a pre-eminent gift , to stand on the confines of both , and separated that which had been created from the Creator .
And this same Word [ Logos ] is continually a suppliant to the immortal God on behalf of the mortal race , which is exposed to affliction and misery ; and is also the ambassador , sent by the Ruler of all , to the subject race .
And the Word [ Logos ] rejoices in the gift , and , exulting in it , announces it and boasts of it , saying , " And I stood in the midst , between the Lord and you ; " neither being uncreate [ d ] as God , nor yet created as you . . . ( p. 293 , The Works of Philo , " Who Is the Heir of Divine Things , " translated by C.D. Yonge )
I TIMOTHY 2:5 For there is one God and one Mediator between God and men , the Man Christ Jesus , ( NKJV )
But if you examine the great high priest , that is to say reason [ Logos ] , you will find him . . . having his sacred garments richly embroidered by the powers which are comprehensible either by the outward senses or by the intellect . . . ( p. 263 , The Works of Philo , " On the Migration of Abraham , " translated by C.D. Yonge )
For there are , as it seems , two temples belonging to God ; one being this world , in which the high priest is the divine Word [ Logos ] , His own first - born son . . . . ( p. 834 , The Works of Philo , " On Dreams , I , " translated by C.D. Yonge )
HEBREWS 8:1
Now this is the main point of the things we are saying :
We have such a High Priest , who is seated at the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens , 2 a Minister of the sanctuary and of the true tabernacle which the Lord erected , and not man .
( NKJV )
I have also heard of one of the companions of Moses having uttered such a speech as this : " Behold , a man whose name is the East [ or " the Branch , " Zec. 6:12 ] ! "
A very novel appellation indeed , if you consider it as spoken of a man who is compounded of body and soul ; but if you look upon it as applied to that incorporeal being who in no respect differs from the divine image , you will then agree that the name of the east has been given to him with great felicity .
For the Father of the universe has caused him to spring up as the eldest son , whom , in another passage , He calls firstborn . . . ( pp. 239-240 , The Works of Philo , " On the Confusion of Tongues , " translated by C.D. Yonge )
ZECHARIAH 6:11 " Take the silver and gold , make an elaborate crown , and set it on the head of Joshua the son of Jehozadak , the high priest .
12 Then speak to him , saying , ' Thus says the LORD of hosts , saying : " Behold , the Man whose name is the BRANCH !
From
His place
He shall branch out , and He shall build the temple of the LORD ; 13 Yes , He shall build the temple of the LORD .
He shall bear the glory , and shall sit and rule on His throne ; so He shall be a priest on His throne , and the counsel of peace shall be between them both . " ' " ( NKJV )
For God , like a shepherd and a king , governs ( as if they were a flock of sheep ) the earth , and the water , and the air , and the fire , and all the plants , and living creatures that are in them , whether mortal or divine . . . appointing as their immediate superintendent ,
His own right Reason [ Logos ] , his firstborn son , who is to receive the charge of this sacred company , as the lieutenant of the great king ; for it is said somewhere , " Behold , I am He !
I will send my messenger before thy face , who shall keep thee in the road [ Exo. 23:20 ] . " ( p. 178 , The Works of Philo , " On Husbandry , " translated by C.D. Yonge )
And the most ancient Word [ Logos ] of the living God is clothed with the word as with a garment , for it has put on earth , and water , and air , and fire , and the things which proceed from these elements .
But the particular soul is clothed with the body , and the mind of the wise man is clothed with the virtues .
And it is said that he will never take the mitre off from his head , he will never lay aside the kingly diadem , the symbol of an authority which is not indeed absolute , but only that of a viceroy , but which is nevertheless an object of admiration .
Nor will he " rend his clothes ; " for the Word [ Logos ] of the living God being the bond of every thing , as has been said before , holds all things together , and binds all the parts , and prevents them from being loosened or separated .
( p. 331 , The Works of Philo , " On Flight and Finding , " translated by C.D. Yonge )
COLOSSIANS 1:16 For by Him all things were created , both in the heavens and on earth , visible and invisible , whether thrones or dominions or rulers or authorities -- all things have been created through Him and for Him .
17 He is before all things , and in Him all things hold together .
( NASU )
. . .
The merciful power of God is the covering of the ark , and He calls it mercy - seat .
The images of the creative power and of the kingly power are the winged cherubim which are placed upon it .
But the divine Word [ Logos ] which above these does not come into any visible appearance , inasmuch as it is not like to any of the things that come under the external senses , but is itself an image of God , the most ancient of all the objects of intellect in the whole world , and that which is placed in the closest proximity to the only truly existing God , without any partition or distance being interposed between them : for it is said , " I will speak unto thee from above the mercy - seat , in the midst , between the cherubim [ Exo. 25:22 ] . "
So that the Word [ Logos ] is , as it were , the charioteer of the powers , and He who utters it is the rider , who directs the charioteer how to proceed with a view to the proper guidance of the universe .

EXODUS 25:21 " You shall put the mercy seat on top of the ark , and in the ark you shall put the Testimony that I will give you .
22 " And there I will meet with you , and I will speak with you from above the mercy seat , from between the two cherubim which are on the ark of the Testimony , about everything which I will give you in commandment to the children of Israel .
( NKJV )
EXODUS 25:21
And thou shalt put the mercy - seat above upon the ark , and within the ark thou shalt lay the Tables of the Testament that I will give thee .
22 And I will appoint My Word with thee there , and will speak with thee from above the mercy - seat , between the two kerubaia that are over the ark of the testament , concerning all that I may command thee for the sons of Israel .
( Targum Pseudo - Jonathan , translated by J.W. Etheridge )
What , then , can it be except the Word [ Logos ] , which is more ancient than all the things which were the objects of creation , and by means of which it is the Ruler of the universe . . . ( p. 253 , The Works of Philo , " On the Migration of Abraham , " translated by C.D. Yonge )

" And God planted a paradise in Eden , in the east : and there He placed the man whom He had formed : " for He called that divine and heavenly Wisdom by many names ; and he made it manifest that it had many appellations ; for He called it the Beginning , and the Image , and the Sight of God. . . . ( p. 29 , The Works of Philo , " Allegorical Interpretation , I , " translated by C.D. Yonge )
REVELATION 3:14
" And to the angel of the church in Laodicea write : ' The words of the Amen , the faithful and true witness , the beginning of God 's creation . ' " ( ESV )
. . .
How then can the daughter of God , namely , Wisdom , be properly called a father ?
Is it because the name indeed of wisdom is feminine but the sex masculine ?
For indeed all the virtues bear the names of women , but have the powers and actions of full - grown men , since whatever is subsequent to God , even if it be the most ancient of all other things , still has only the second place when compared with that omnipotent Being , and appears not so much masculine as feminine . . .
We say , therefore , without paying any attention to the difference here existing in the names , that wisdom , the daughter of God , is both male and a father . . . ( p. 325 , The Works of Philo , " On Flight and Finding , " translated by C.D. Yonge )
PROVERBS 8:22 " The Lord created me at the beginning of His work , the first of His acts of old .
23 Ages ago I was set up , at the first , before the beginning of the earth .
24 When there were no depths I was brought forth , when there were no springs abounding with water .
25 Before the mountains had been shaped , before the hills , I was brought forth ; 26 before
He had made the earth with its fields , or the first of the dust of the world .
27 When
He established the heavens , I was there , when He drew a circle on the face of the deep , 28 when He made firm the skies above , when He established the fountains of the deep , 29 when He assigned to the sea its limit , so that the waters might not transgress
His command , when He marked out the foundations of the earth , 30 then I was beside Him , like a master workman ; and I was daily His delight , rejoicing before Him always , 31 rejoicing in His inhabited world , and delighting in the sons of men . " ( RSV )
. . .
For the abrupt Rock is the Wisdom of God , which being both sublime and the first of things he quarried out of his own powers , and of it he gives drink to the souls that love God ; and they , when they have drunk , are also filled with the most universal manna ; for manna is called something which is the primary genus of every thing .
But the most universal of all things is God ; and in the second place the Word [ Logos ] of God. ( p. 47 , The Works of Philo , " Allegorical Interpretation , II , " translated by C.D. Yonge )
. . .
He nourishes us with his own Word [ Logos ] , which is the most universal of all things , for manna being interpreted means " what ? " and " what " is the most universal of all things ; for the Word [ Logos ] is over all the world , and is the most ancient , and the most universal of all things that are created .
( p. 70 , The Works of Philo , " Allegorical Interpretation , III , " translated by C.D. Yonge )
JOHN 6:31 " Our fathers ate the manna in the desert ; as it is written , ' He gave them bread from heaven to eat . ' " 32 Then Jesus said to them , " Most assuredly , I say to you , Moses did not give you the bread from heaven , but My Father gives you the true bread from heaven .
33 For the bread of God is He who comes down from heaven and gives life to the world . "
34 Then they said to Him , " Lord , give us this bread always . "
35 And Jesus said to them , " I am the bread of life .
He who comes to Me shall never hunger , and he who believes in Me shall never thirst . "
( NKJV )
As the preceding comparisons show , much of what Philo wrote about the Logos is paralleled in the Bible .
When viewed objectively , this clearly does not support some of the later theories about the identity of Yeshua .
In her provocative and controversial book about Israel 's " second God , " Margaret Barker details the conflict that arose between Jews who accepted Yeshua as the prophesied Messiah and those who did n't .
The origin of what became orthodox rabbinic Jewish thought can be traced back to this pivotal time :
There can be little doubt , in light of passages such as these , that Jesus had been identified with the second God , whom Philo called the Logos , and whom the Targumists remembered as the Memra , the manifestation of Yahweh with his people .
Problems have arisen in the understanding of the Targums because proper account has not been taken of this second God , the great Angel . . . .
The rabbinic writings from the first Christian centuries show that they were engaged in a controversy with heretical groups , who taught that there were two powers in heaven .
It is not possible to identify these groups with certainty because they are never named , but investigations have shown that the controversy was ' almost entirely confined to Palestine ' . . .
In addition , the earliest evidence for this dispute centred on the understanding of particular passages of Scripture which the heretics had been using to demonstrate that there were two powers in heaven .
These heretics did not see the two powers as opposing one another , i.e. they were not early gnostics , but rather they saw them as a far God and a near God .
This suggests that the heretics were the Christians ; they originated in Palestine , they believed in a second divine person and they took as one of their key scriptural passages the son of man vision in Dan.
7 , the very text which formed the starting point of the rabbis ' polemic .
It is possible to reconstruct only the outlines of what must have been a bitter dispute , but the strength and ferocity of the debates , added to the enormous length of time over which the arguments were refined , shows that this was a cause of great concern .
( pp. 152 - 153 , The Great Angel )
Below is the passage of Scripture from Daniel used by Christians to prove that Yeshua was a divine spirit being , and not merely a man :
DANIEL 7:13 " I was watching in the night visions , and behold , one like the Son of Man , coming with the clouds of heaven !
He came to the Ancient of Days , and they brought him near before Him .
14 Then to him was given dominion and glory and a kingdom , that all peoples , nations , and languages should serve him .
His dominion is an everlasting dominion , which shall not pass away , and his kingdom the one which shall not be destroyed .
( NKJV )
" Son of Man " was one of the titles from the Old Testament that referred to the Messiah .
Yeshua frequently used this term to refer to himself in the Gospels ( 32 times in Matt. , 14 times in Mark , 25 times in Luke , and 12 times in John ) .
He is also called by this title by Stephen ( Acts 7:56 ) and John in Revelation ( Rev. 1:13 ; 14:14 ) .
Daniel 7:13 , Psalm 8:4 and possibly Psalm 80:17 are the only places in the Tanakh where this title refers to the Messiah .
The ancient writings of the Jewish rabbis show that there was a significant conflict in the 1st century between rabbinic Judaism and a heresy they referred to as " two powers in heaven . "
Columbia University professor of religion Alan Segal did an in - depth study of this theological debate between the rabbis and those who professed a belief in two divine beings .
In his summary of the rabbinic writings which opposed this position , he defined the differences of belief :
The crucial issues which can be dated early are : ( 1 ) a dangerous understanding of Dan. 7:9 f. ; ( 2 ) dangerous contradictions between the portrayal of God as heavenly warrior ( especially in Ex. 15:3 ) and the figure of an old man on a heavenly throne assumed to be described in various theophanies ( especially Ex. 24:10 f. ) ; ( 3 ) a tradition about a principal angel , based on Ex. 20 f. , said to be Metatron in the amoraic traditions but whose real significance is that he is YHWH or the bearer of the divine name ( using Ex. 23:21 f. ) .
These passages may have little in common in their origin .
But they all picture God Himself as a man or posit a principal angel , with the shape of a man , who aids God in the governance of the world .
. . .
The earliest isolatable rabbinic opposition to " two powers , " then , is not against ethical dualism , but against a principal angel or mediator .
( p. 149 , Two Powers In Heaven )
As Segal points out in his book , the rabbis were not primarily battling outside pagans who held this belief in " two powers . "
Rather , they were contending with fellow Jews and God-fearing Gentiles who attended the synagogues ( cf. Acts 13:42 : 14:1 ; 17:1-4 , 10-12 , 17 ; 18:4 ) :
The mishnaic evidence emphasizes the second thrust of the rabbinic offensive against heresy - ostracism from the synagogue .
It is likely that the " two powers " sects were among the heretical groups excluded from the synagogue during earliest times . . .
The process of ostracism probably received its first impetus from Gamaliel - who expanded the curse against enemies of the synagogue to include the minim . . .
We are sure that Christians were called " two powers " heretics by the late tannaim . . .
It seems clear , then , that the synagogue and academies in Palestine were the locus of the debate and defense against " two powers . "
Exegesis was the earliest battleground of the conflict .
Although the answers to the heretics were worked out by the academies , the question must have been raised in relation to Bible - reading and by groups who were interested in hearing the Jewish Bible expounded .
Since we know that some " two powers " heretics were among those cursed in the synagogue , we can assume the following tentative reconstruction of the evidence :
Either contemporary with the exegetical problem or immediately after it , a successful campaign was mounted to silence various sectarians in the synagogue by regulating the content and procedures of prayer .
Among those silenced were some evincing " two powers " interpretations of scripture .
The sectarians may not have called themselves " two gods " or " two powers " heretics .
Only the offended party , from a new position of authority , described these doctrines as heresy .
When the rabbis insisted that prayers in synagogue meet specific standards of monotheism , the incipient heretics and the rabbis withdrew from each other by mutual consent but certainly on less than peaceful terms .
Although they separated , the groups encountered each other in debate frequently , showing that the heretics continued to proliferate and that they remained in close proximity to the rabbinic community .
( pp. 152 , 154 , Ibid . )
The available evidence from the ancient Jewish writings shows that this " two powers " doctrine developed among those who attended the synagogues .
As the New Testament shows , many thousands of Torah - observant Jews were among the early believers in Yeshua the Messiah ( Acts 21:20 ) .
These Jews , who believed that Yeshua was a " second power in heaven , " would have met in the synagogues along with their non-messianic counterparts .
As the rabbinic evidence indicates , the belief that Yeshua was a divine being eventually led to their expulsion from the synagogues in the late 1st and early 2nd centuries .
The next piece of evidence from the early Christian era is from the Odes of Solomon .
Odes is the earliest known Christian book of hymns or psalms , containing a total of 42 odes .
This collection of hymns is titled the Odes of Solomon because it was called this in other ancient references .
The originals were in Aramaic , indicating that the authors were probably messianic Jews .
Regarding the date of the Odes , The Anchor Bible Dictionary states :
The date of the Odes has caused considerable interest .
H.J. Drivers contends that they are as late as the 3d century .
L. Abramowski places them in the latter half of the 2d century .
B. McNeil argued that they are contemporaneous with 4 Ezra , the Shepherd of Hermas , Polycarp , and Valentinus ( ca. 100 C.E. ) .
Most scholars date them sometime around the middle of the 2d century , but if they are heavily influenced by Jewish apocalyptic thought and especially the ideas in the Dead Sea Scrolls , a date long after 100 is unlikely .
H. Chadwick , Emerton , Charlesworth , and many other scholars , are convinced that they must not be labeled " gnostic , " and therefore should not be dated to the late 2d or 3d century .
( p. 114 , vol. 6 , " Solomon , Odes of " )
Let 's take a closer look at one of the hymns ( Ode 36 ) which is written from the viewpoint of the Messiah :
ODE 36
I rested on the Spirit of the Lord , and She lifted me up to heaven ;
And caused me to stand on my feet in the Lord 's high place , before His perfection and His glory ,
Where I continued glorifying Him by the composition of His Odes .
The Spirit brought me forth before the Lord 's face , and because I was the Son of Man ,
I was named the Light , the Son of God ;
Because I was the most glorified among the glorious ones , and the greatest among the great ones .
For according to the greatness of the Most High , so She [ the Spirit of the Lord ] made me ;
And according to His newness
He renewed me .
And He anointed me with His perfection ; and I became one of those who are near Him .
And my mouth was opened like a cloud of dew , and my heart gushed forth like a gusher of righteousness .
And my approach was in peace , and I was established in the Spirit of Providence .
Hallelujah .
( Odes of Solomon )
This hymn shows that early Messianic Jews understood that Yeshua was the " Son of Man , " the greatest and most glorious of the beney ' elohim ( " sons of God " ) .
He was " made " by the Spirit of the Lord ( called " she " because the Aramaic word for " spirit " is feminine ) according to the greatness of the Most High , God the Father .
One of the first writers after the apostles is Ignatius ( c. 30 - 107 CE ) , the bishop of Antioch .
Tradition says that he and Polycarp were disciples under the apostle John .
He was martyred by order of the Roman emperor Trajan , being carried captive from Antioch to Rome and thrown to wild animals in the Flavian amphitheater .
Ignatius ' letters show us that during the late 1st and early 2nd centuries , Christians still understood that the Messiah was God 's only - begotten ( Gr. monogenes , " unique " )
Son , begotten before the universe was created .
Here are some selected references Ignatius makes to the origin of the Son in his epistles :
. . .
But our Physician is the only true God , the unbegotten and unapproachable , the Lord of all , the Father and Begetter of the only - begotten Son .
We also have as a Physician the Lord our God , Jesus the Christ , the only - begotten Son and Word , before time began , but who afterwards became also man , of Mary the virgin .
For " the Word was made flesh . " ( pp. 110 - 111 , vol .
I , The Ante- Nicene Fathers , " The Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians " )
. . .
For the Son of God , who was begotten before time began , and established all things according to the will of the Father , He was conceived in the womb of Mary , according to the appointment of God , of the seed of David , and by the Holy Ghost .
( p. 120 , vol .
I , The Ante- Nicene Fathers , " The Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians " )
. . .
Do ye all come together in common , and individually , through grace , in one faith of God the Father , and of Jesus Christ His only - begotten Son , and " the first - born of every creature , " but of the seed of David according to the flesh . . . ( p. 122 , vol .
I , The Ante- Nicene Fathers , " The Epistle of Ignatius to the Ephesians " )
. . . Jesus Christ .
He , being begotten by the Father before the beginning of time , was God the Word , the only - begotten Son , and remains the same for ever . . . ( p. 129 , vol .
I , The Ante- Nicene Fathers , " The Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians " )
. . .
Christ , who was begotten by the Father before all ages , but was afterwards born of the Virgin Mary without any intercourse with man .
. . .
To those who had fallen into the error of polytheism
He made known the one and only true God , His Father . . . ( p. 134 , vol .
I , The Ante- Nicene Fathers , " The Epistle of Ignatius to the Magnesians " )
. . .
One of the ancients gives us this advice , " Let no man be called good who mixes good with evil . "
For they speak of Christ , not that they may preach Christ , but that they may reject Christ ; and they speak of the law , not that they may establish the law , but that they may proclaim things contrary to it .
For they alienate Christ from the Father , and the law from Christ .
They also calumniate
His being born of the Virgin ; they are ashamed of His cross ; they deny His passion ; and they do not believe His resurrection .
They introduce God as a Being unknown ; they suppose Christ to be unbegotten ; and as to the Spirit , they do not admit that He exists .
Some of them say that the Son is a mere man , and that the Father , Son , and Holy Spirit are but the same person , and that the creation is the work of God , not by Christ , but by some other strange power .
( p. 142 , vol .
I , The Ante- Nicene Fathers , " The Epistle of Ignatius to the Trallians " )
. . .
Since , also , there is but one unbegotten Being , God , even the Father ; and one only - begotten Son , God , the Word and man . . . ( p. 165 , vol .
I , The Ante- Nicene Fathers , " The Epistle of Ignatius to the Philadelphians " )
. . .
Being fully persuaded , in very truth , with respect to our Lord Jesus Christ , that He was the Son of God , " the first - born of every creature , " God the Word , the only - begotten Son , and was of the seed of David according to the flesh , by the Virgin Mary . . . ( p. 175 , vol .
I , The Ante- Nicene Fathers , " The Epistle of Ignatius to the Smyraeans " )
And [ know ye , moreover ] , that He who was born of a woman was the Son of God , and He that was crucified was " the first - born of every creature , " and God the Word , who also created all things .
For says the apostle , " There is one God , the Father , of whom are all things ; and one Lord Jesus Christ , by whom are all things . "
And again , " For there is one God , and one Mediator between God and man , the man Christ Jesus ; " and , " By Him were all things created that are in heaven , and on earth , visible and invisible ; and He is before all things , and by Him all things consist . " ( p. 212 , vol .
I , The Ante- Nicene Fathers , " The Epistle of Ignatius to the Tarsians " )
Nor is
He a mere man , by whom and in whom all things were made ; for " all things were made by Him . "
" When He made the heaven , I was present with Him ; and I was there with Him , forming [ the world along with Him ] , and He rejoiced in me daily . "
And how could a mere man be addressed in such words as these : " Sit Thou at My right hand ? "
And how , again , could such an one declare : " Before Abraham was , I am ? "
And , " Glorify Me with Thy glory which I had before the world was ? "
What man could ever say , " I came down from heaven , not to do Mine own will , but the will of Him that sent Me ? "
And of what man could it be said , " He was the true Light , which lighteth every man that cometh into the world :
He was in the world , and the world was made by Him , and the world knew Him not .
He came unto His own , and His own received Him not ? "
How could such a one be a mere man , receiving the beginning of His existence from Mary , and not rather God the Word , and the only - begotten Son ?
For " in the beginning was the Word , and the Word was with God , and the Word was God . "
And in another place , " The Lord created Me , the beginning of His ways , for His ways , for His works .
Before the world did He found Me , and before all the hills did He beget Me. " ( p. 213 , vol .
I , The Ante- Nicene Fathers , " The Epistle of Ignatius to the Tarsians " )
I write this letter to you from Philippi .
May
He who is alone unbegotten , keep you steadfast both in the spirit and in the flesh , through Him who was begotten before time began ! ( p. 222 , vol .
I , The Ante- Nicene Fathers , " The Epistle of Ignatius to the Antiochians " )
Justin Martyr was a 2nd- century Gentile Christian born in Flavia Neapolis , Samaria ( the modern Nablus ) .
Living from about 114 - 165 CE , he was well educated , having studied Socratic and Platonic philosophy .
Justin is considered the first Christian author and founder of Christian theological literature .
One of Justin 's principal works is the Dialogue with Trypho .
Trypho was a Jew who debated the identity of Christ with Justin .
Justin's Dialogue was the first significant Christian exposition on why Yeshua should be regarded as the Messiah prophesied in the Old Testament .
Justin spends much of his time making the case to Trypho that the preincarnate Christ was the 'elohim seen by the patriarchs and ancient Israel :
And all the Jews even now teach that the nameless God spake to Moses . . .
Now the Word of God is His Son , as we have before said .
And He is called Angel and Apostle ; for He declares whatever we ought to know , and is sent forth to declare whatever is revealed ; as our Lord Himself says , " He that heareth Me , heareth Him that sent Me . "
From the writings of Moses also this will be manifest ; for thus it is written in them , " And the Angel of God spake to Moses , in a flame of fire out of the bush , and said , I am that I am , the God of Abraham , the God of Isaac , the God of Jacob , the God of thy fathers ; go down into Egypt , and bring forth My people . "
And if you wish to learn what follows , you can do so from the same writings ; for it is impossible to relate the whole here .
But so much is written for the sake of proving that Jesus the Christ is the Son of God and His Apostle , being of old the Word , and appearing sometimes in the form of fire , and sometimes in the likeness of angels ; but now , by the will of God , having become man for the human race . . . ( p. 351 , vol .
I , The Ante- Nicene Fathers , " Dialogue with Trypho " )
As Justin 's initial statement shows , by the middle of the second century common Jewish thought had changed regarding the identity of the one who had anciently interacted with Israel .
This change was likely a rabbinic reaction to the early Messianic Jewish belief that Yeshua the Messiah was the Angel of YHVH , the Word of God who had interacted with ancient Israel .
Justin clearly explains that the God manifested to ancient Israel was this Angel :
" Reverting to the Scriptures , I shall endeavor to persuade you , that He who is said to have appeared to Abraham , and to Jacob , and to Moses , and who is called God , is distinct from Him who made all things , -- numerically , I mean , not [ distinct ] in will .
For I affirm that He has never at any time done anything which He who made the world -- above whom there is no other God -- has not wished Him both to do and to engage Himself with . " ( p. 445 , vol .
I , The Ante- Nicene Fathers , " Dialogue with Trypho " )
It is again written by Moses , my brethren , that He who is called God and appeared to the patriarchs is called both Angel and Lord , in order that from this you may understand Him to be minister to the Father of all things . . . " ( p. 449 , vol .
I , The Ante- Nicene Fathers , " Dialogue with Trypho " )
" I shall give you another testimony , my friends , " said I , " from the Scriptures , that God begat before all creatures a Beginning , [ who was ] a certain rational power [ proceeding ] from Himself , who is called by the Holy Spirit , now the Glory of the Lord , now the Son , again Wisdom , again an Angel , then God , and then Lord and Logos ; and on another occasion
He calls Himself Captain , when He appeared in human form to Joshua the son of Nave ( Nun ) .
For
He can be called by all those names , since
He ministers to the Father 's will , and since He was begotten of the Father by an act of will . . .
The Word of Wisdom , who is Himself this God begotten of the Father of all things , and Word , and Wisdom , and Power , and the Glory of the Begetter , will bear evidence to me , when He speaks by Solomon the following : ' If I shall declare to you what happens daily , I shall call to mind events from everlasting , and review them .
The Lord made me the beginning of His ways for His works .
From everlasting
He established me in the beginning , before
He had made the earth , and before
He had made the deeps , before the springs of the waters had issued forth , before the mountains had been established .
Before all the hills
He begets me .
God made the country , and the desert , and the highest inhabited places under the sky .
When
He made ready the heavens , I was along with Him , and when He set up
His throne on the winds : when He made the high clouds strong , and the springs of the deep safe , when He made the foundations of the earth , I was with Him arranging .
I was that in which He rejoiced ; daily and at all times I delighted in His countenance , because
He delighted in the finishing of the habitable world , and delighted in the sons of men .
( pp. 453-454 , vol .
I , The Ante- Nicene Fathers , " Dialogue with Trypho " )
. . .
This Offspring , which was truly brought forth from the Father , was with the Father before all the creatures , and the Father communed with Him ; even as the Scripture by Solomon has made clear , that He whom Solomon calls Wisdom , was begotten as a Beginning before all His creatures and as Offspring by God . . . ( p. 455 , vol .
I , The Ante- Nicene Fathers , " Dialogue with Trypho " )
. . .
When Isaiah calls
Him the Angel of mighty counsel [ Isa. 9:6 , LXX ] , did he not foretell Him to be the Teacher of those truths which He did teach when He came [ to earth ] ?
For
He alone taught openly those mighty counsels which the Father designed both for all those who have been and shall be well - pleasing to Him , and also for those who have rebelled against
His will , whether men or angels . . . ( p. 474 , vol .
I , The Ante- Nicene Fathers , " Dialogue with Trypho " )
. . .
For if
He also were to be begotten of sexual intercourse , like all other first - born sons , why did God say that He would give a sign which is not common to all the first - born sons ?
But that which is truly a sign , and which was to be made trustworthy to mankind , namely , -- that the first - begotten of all creation should become incarnate by the Virgin 's womb , and be a child , -- this he anticipated by the Spirit of prophecy , and predicted it . . . ( p. 484 , vol .
I , The Ante- Nicene Fathers , " Dialogue with Trypho " )
. . .
This very Son of God -- who is the First - born of every creature , who became man by the Virgin , who suffered , and was crucified under Pontius Pilate . . . ( p. 485 , vol .
I , The Ante- Nicene Fathers , " Dialogue with Trypho " )
. . .
He said : ' All things are delivered unto me by My Father ; ' and , ' No man knoweth the Father but the Son ; nor the Son but the Father , and they to whom the Son will reveal Him . '
Accordingly
He revealed to us all that we have perceived by His grace out of the Scriptures , so that we know Him to be the first - begotten of God , and to be before all creatures ; likewise to be the Son of the patriarchs , since
He assumed flesh by the Virgin of their family , and submitted to become a man without comeliness , dishonored , and subject to suffering ....
For [ Christ ] called one of His disciples -- previously known by the name of Simon -- Peter ; since he recognized Him to be Christ the Son of God , by the revelation of His Father : and since we find it recorded in the memoirs of His apostles that He is the Son of God , and since we call Him the Son , we have understood that He proceeded before all creatures from the Father by His power and will ( for He is addressed in the writings of the prophets in one way or another as Wisdom ) . . . ( p. 503 , vol .
I , The Ante- Nicene Fathers , " Dialogue with Trypho " )
" But if you knew , Trypho , " continued I , " who He is that is called at one time the Angel of great counsel , and a Man by Ezekiel , and like the Son of man by Daniel , and a Child by Isaiah , and Christ and God to be worshipped by David , and Christ and a Stone by many , and Wisdom by Solomon , and Joseph and Judah and a Star by Moses , and the East by Zechariah , and the Suffering One and Jacob and Israel by Isaiah again , and a Rod , and Flower , and Corner - Stone , and Son of God , you would not have blasphemed Him who has now come , and been born , and suffered , and ascended to heaven ; who shall also come again , and then your twelve tribes shall mourn .
For if you had understood what has been written by the prophets , you would not have denied that He was God , Son of the only , unbegotten , unutterable God. ( p. 535 , vol .
I , The Ante- Nicene Fathers , " Dialogue with Trypho " )
" . . .
Christ being Lord , and God the Son of God , and appearing formerly in power as Man , and Angel , and in the glory of fire as at the bush , so also was manifested at the judgment executed on Sodom , has been demonstrated fully by what has been said .

And do not suppose , sirs , that I am speaking superfluously when I repeat these words frequently : but it is because I know that some wish to anticipate these remarks , and to say that the power sent from the Father of all which appeared to Moses , or to Abraham , or to Jacob , is called an Angel because
He came to men ( for by Him the commands of the Father have been proclaimed to men ) ; is called Glory , because
He appears in a vision sometimes that cannot be borne ; is called a Man , and a human being , because
He appears strayed in such forms as the Father pleases ; and they call Him the Word , because
He carries tidings from the Father to men : but maintain that this power is indivisible and inseparable from the Father , just as they say that the light of the sun on earth is indivisible and inseparable from the sun in the heavens ; as when it sinks , the light sinks along with it ; so the Father , when He chooses , say they , causes
His power to spring forth , and when He chooses , He makes it return to Himself .
In this way , they teach , He made the angels .
But it is proved that there are angels who always exist , and are never reduced to that form out of which they sprang .
And that this power which the prophetic word calls God , as has been also amply demonstrated , and Angel , is not numbered [ as different ] in name only like the light of the sun but is indeed something numerically distinct , I have discussed briefly in what has gone before ; when I asserted that this power was begotten from the Father , by His power and will , but not by abscission , as if the essence of the Father were divided ; as all other things partitioned and divided are not the same after as before they were divided : and , for the sake of example , I took the case of fires kindled from a fire , which we see to be distinct from it , and yet that from which many can be kindled is by no means made less , but remains the same .
" And now I shall again recite the words which I have spoken in proof of this point .
When Scripture says , ' The Lord rained fire from the Lord out of heaven , ' the prophetic word indicates that there were two in number :
One upon the earth , who , it says , descended to behold the cry of Sodom ; another in heaven , who also is Lord of the Lord on earth , as He is Father and God ; the cause of His power and of His being Lord and God. . . .
And it is written in the book of Wisdom : ' If I should tell you daily events , I would be mindful to enumerate them from the beginning .
The Lord created me the beginning of His ways for His works .
From everlasting
He established me in the beginning , before
He formed the earth , and before
He made the depths , and before the springs of waters came forth , before the mountains were settled ;
He begets me before all the hills . ' "
When I repeated these words , I added : " You perceive , my hearers , if you bestow attention , that the Scripture has declared that this Offspring was begotten by the Father before all things created ; and that which is begotten is numerically distinct from that which begets , any one will admit .

Our teacher of these things is Jesus Christ , who also was born for this purpose , and was crucified under Pontius Pilate , procurator of Judaea , in the times of Tiberius Caesar ; and that we reasonably worship Him , having learned that He is the Son of the true God Himself , and holding Him in the second place . . .
For they proclaim our madness to consist in this , that we give to a crucified man a place second to the unchangeable and eternal God , the Creator of all . . . ( p. 309 , vol .

For they who affirm that the Son is the Father , are proved neither to have become acquainted with the Father , nor to know that the Father of the universe has a Son ; who also , being the first - begotten Word of God , is even God .

And His son , who along is properly called Son , the Word , who also was with Him and was begotten before the works , when at first
He created and arranged all things by Him , is called Christ , in reference to His being anointed and God 's ordering all things through Him . . . ( p. 364 , vol .

Another early Christian literary work that shows the common understanding of the Messiah is The Shepherd of Hermas ( also known as The Pastor of Hermas ) .
This work is dated to about 160 CE , and Hermas was one of the most popular books of Christianity during the 2nd , 3rd , and 4th centuries .
Hermas is divided into three primary sections .
There are five visions , twelve mandates ; and ten parables ( also called " similitudes " ) .
The overall theme of the visions is repentance and remaining faithful in the face of persecution .
" God planted the vineyard , that is to say , He created the people , and gave them to His Son ; and the Son appointed His angels over them to keep them ; and He Himself purged away their sins , having suffered many trials and undergone many labors , for no one is able to dig without labor and toil .
He Himself , then , having purged away the sins of the people , showed them the paths of life by giving them the law which He received from His Father .
[ You see , " he said , " that He is the Lord of the people , having received all authority from His Father . ] " ( p. 73 , vol .
II , The Ante- Nicene Fathers , " The Pastor of Hermas " )
This great tree that casts its shadow over plains , and mountains , and all the earth , is the law of God that was given to the whole world ; and this law is the Son of God , proclaimed to the ends of the earth ; and the people who are under its shadow are they who have heard the proclamation , and have believed upon Him .
And the great and glorious angel Michael is he who has authority over this people , and governs them ; for this is he who gave them the law into the hearts of believers : he accordingly superintends them to whom he gave it , to see if they have kept the same .
( p. 84 , vol .
II , The Ante- Nicene Fathers , " The Pastor of Hermas " )
A comparison of the two passages above shows that the Son of God , who gave the people the Law he received from his Father , was also known as " the great and glorious angel Michael . "
It is this same Son that came to earth as Yeshua and purged the sins of those who believed by his sacrifice .
Hermas goes on to speak of the age of the Son :
" Listen , " he said , " and understand , O ignorant man .
The Son of God is older than all His creatures , so that He was a fellow - councilor with the Father in His work of creation : for this reason is He old . "
( Ibid. , p. 100 )
The Shepherd of Hermas confirms that in the mid-2nd century , believers still had some understanding of the preincarnate identity and origin of Yeshua .
Origen , a Catholic theologian / philosopher writing in the first half of the 3rd century , shows that the Christian belief in " two powers in heaven " was still a point of contention at that time .
In his apologetic work Against Celsus , Origen disputes the pagan author 's contention that Christians were hypocritical for condemning polytheism while worshiping two Gods :
In what follows , some may imagine that he says something plausible against us .
" If , " says he , " these people worshipped one God alone , and no other , they would perhaps have some valid argument against the worship of others .
But they pay excessive reverence to one who has but lately appeared among men , and they think it no offense against God if they worship also His servant . "
To this we reply , that if Celsus had known that saying , " I and My Father are one , " and the words used in prayer by the Son of God , " As Thou and I are one , " he would not have supposed that we worship any other besides Him who is the Supreme God .
" For , " says He , " My Father is in Me , and I in Him . "
And if any should from these words be afraid of our going over to the side of those who deny that the Father and the Son are two persons , let him weigh that passage , " And the multitude of them that believed were of one heart and of one soul , " that he may understand the meaning of the saying , " I and My Father are one . "
We worship one God , the Father and the Son , therefore , as we have explained ; and our argument against the worship of other gods still continues valid .
And we do not " reverence beyond measure one who has but lately appeared , " as though He did not exist before ; for we believe Himself when He says , " Before Abraham was , I am . "
Again
He says , " I am the truth ; " and surely none of us is so simple as to suppose that truth did not exist before the time when Christ appeared .
We worship , therefore , the Father of truth , and the Son , who is the truth ; and these , while they are two , considered as persons or subsistences , are one in unity of thought , in harmony and in identity of will .
So entirely are they one , that he who has seen the Son , " who is the brightness of God 's glory , and the express image of His person , " has seen in Him who is the image , of God , God Himself .
( pp. 1327-1328 , vol .

. . .
He is the Son who has been most highly exalted by the Father .
Grant that there may be some individuals among the multitudes of believers who are not in entire agreement with us , and who incautiously assert that the Savior is the Most High God ; however , we do not hold with them , but rather believe Him when He says , " The Father who sent Me is greater than I . " ( p. 1330 , vol .

. . .
Our duty is to pray to the Most High God alone , and to the Only - begotten , the First - born of the whole creation , and to ask Him as our High Priest to present the prayers which ascend to Him from us , to His God and our God , to His Father and the Father of those who direct their lives according to His word .

IV , The Ante- Nicene Fathers , " De Principiis " )
Gnosticism was one of the first heresies to arise which advocated a non-scriptural explanation for the identity of the Messiah .
Gnosticism likely began as a corruption of the ancient understanding of the heavenly divine council .
Regarding the origins of Gnosticism , Margaret Barker writes :
. . .
There is not one myth of the fallen angels , but , in the texts we have , a considerable diversity , suggesting that something very ancient was involved .
. . .
This diversity in the angel mythology counts for the diversity in the later gnostic systems .
Stroumsa has shown that 'a radical transformation of this myth ( the fallen angels ) forms the basis of the Gnostic mythological consciousness of evil ' . . .
The possession of knowledge made one wise like the angels . . .
Mankind was forbidden the knowledge which could make him like the 'elohim , like the angels . . . ( pp. 162-163 , 164 , The Great Angel )
Gnosticism was n't a separate religion ; rather , it was a philosophy that was blended with components of existing religions .
Elements of Messianic Judaism ( Christianity ) were combined with Gnostic beliefs beginning in the middle of the 1st century , creating the heretical teachings that New Testament writers Paul and John battled ( cf. Colossians , I John , II John ) .
The term " Gnostic " comes from the Greek word gnosis , which means " knowledge . "
Gnosticism was a complex religious philosophy which taught that salvation could only be achieved through secret knowledge .
The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia ( ISBE ) records the following general characteristics found within Gnostic belief systems :
The following may be regarded as the chief points in the Gnostic systems :
(1 ) a claim on the part of the initiated to a special knowledge of the truth ; a tendency to regard knowledge as superior to faith and as the special possession of the more enlightened , for ordinary Christians did not possess this secret and higher doctrine ;
( 2 ) the essential separation of matter and spirit , matter being intrinsically evil and the source from which all evil has arisen ;
( 3 ) an attempt to solve the problems of creation and the origin of evil by postulating a demiurge , i.e. , a creator or artificer of the world distinct from the deity , and emanations extending between God and the visible universe ( the demiurge for the Gnostics being the God of the OT , an inferior being infinitely remote from the Supreme Being who can have nothing to do with anything material ) ;
( 4 ) a denial of the true humanity of Christ ; a docetic Christology which considered the earthly life of Christ and especially His sufferings on the cross to be unreal ;
( 5 ) the denial of the personality of the Supreme God , and also the denial of the free will of mankind ;
( 6 ) the teaching , on the one hand , of asceticism as the means of attaining spiritual communion with God , and , on the other hand , of an indifference that led directly to licentiousness ;
( 7 ) a syncretistic tendency that combined certain more or less misunderstood Christian doctrines and various elements from oriental , Jewish , Greek , and other sources ;
( 8 ) ascription of the OT to the demiurge or inferior creator of the world .
Some of these ideas are more obvious in one and some of them in another of the Gnostic systems .
( p. 486 , vol. 2 , " Gnosticism " )
Christian Gnostic doctrine stated that the Messiah really did n't come to the earth as a human being .
Because they believed that flesh was evil by nature , Gnostics sought a way to separate the spiritual Savior from Yeshua the man .
They did this by two separate but related teachings ; ( 1 ) that the Messiah was a spiritual being who entered the man Jesus at his baptism and left him at his crucifixion ; or ( 2 ) that Jesus was n't really flesh and blood , but simply a spirit being in a phantom body .
Since Gnostics believed that the Messiah was not actually flesh , they taught that one did not need the atoning sacrifice of his blood for salvation .
Rather , the Gnostics stressed that salvation could be attained only through the secret knowledge that Christ had brought to his disciples .
The Gnostic doctrine regarding the Messiah was labeled Docetism .
It was first of many human attempts to understand and define who Jesus Christ really was .
This doctrine reached its peak in the 2nd century CE .
Several competing theories regarding the nature of the Messiah arose in the 2nd and 3rd centuries .
These included Modalism , Adoptionism , and Trinitarianism .
Probably the most popular 2nd- century doctrine regarding the identity of the Messiah was Modalism ( also called Monarchianism ) .
Modalism states that there is only one Person in the Godhead .
Modalists believe that God the Father has manifested Himself at different times in different modes .
Therefore , the Father , Son , and Holy Spirit are but three names for the same Deity .
In the third chapter of his work Against Praxeus , Tertullian ( the founder of Latin Christianity ) indicates that Monarchianism was the most common belief regarding the identity of Christ by the end of the 2nd century CE .
The rise of Modalism is described by author Arthur Cushman McGiffert :
. . .
There were many who felt that to call Jesus the Son of God was to detract from his dignity and to deprive him of the place that rightly belonged to him .
They were interested primarily in salvation rather than creation and the Saviour was more to them than the Creator .
In these circumstances they could not consent to have the supreme place assigned to the Creator and the Saviour subordinated to him .
The divine Lord and Saviour Jesus Christ was the only God they needed .
To associate another God with him and particularly to put another God above him offended them deeply .
If it were necessary to recognize a creating as well as a saving God , then the Lord Jesus Christ whom they worshipped , and faith in whom had brought them into the Christian church , was himself creator as well as saviour ; they neither knew nor cared to know any other God apart from him .
. . .
Their original position was very simple and quite without theological implications .
Christ is the Father , the creator of heaven and earth .
It is the Father that appeared on earth , was born of a virgin , and suffered and died on the cross .
The arguments used in support of this position were chiefly Scriptural : " I and the Father are one " ; " He that hath seen me hath seen the Father " and other similar utterances .
( pp. 232-233 , 237 , vol .
I , A History of Christian Thought )
The most renowned and significant Modalist theologian was Sabellius .
Coming from north Africa about 215 CE , he taught in Rome until 220 .
Sabellius developed the most comprehensive explanation of the Monarchian view of the Godhead .
McGiffert writes of Sabellius :
. . .
He seems to have been interested more than the others in preserving the unity of God and he insisted in the strongest possible way that God is one person as well as one substance .
As one person he is indivisible but he has three energies or operations : creating and governing , redeeming , regenerating and sanctifying .
As creator and governor God is called Father , as redeemer he is called Son , as regenerator and sanctifier he is called Holy Spirit .
But it is one and the same God , one and the same divine person , who acts in all these ways .
The difference is not in being or person , but in function or activity .
Each of these functions or activities -- Father , Son and Spirit -- was called by Sabellius prosopon ( π ρό σωπον ) , the Greek word of which the Latin translation is persona .
The word means not person but face , and was used for the mask worn by actors in the theatre or for the part they played .
. . .
Sabellius became the principal leader of the Modalists in Rome and was opposed , as other Modalists were , by Hippolytus , a champion of the Logos Christology .
For the sake of peace Bishop Callixtus ( 217-222 ) , although himself a Modalist , excommunicated both Sabellius and Hippolytus , the leaders of the two hostile groups , and set up his own compromising formula . . . ( pp. 238 , 239 , Ibid . )
Adoptionism , another theoretical explanation of the identity of the Messiah , was also present during this time period .
However , it never received widespread popular acceptance in the west .
This doctrine was spread by Theodotus , a leather dealer from Smyrna , and its adherents were originally called Theodotians .
He came to Rome about 190 CE and taught that Yeshua was merely a man adopted by God who had divinity bestowed upon him at the time of his baptism .
He found little support for his teaching in the western part of the Roman empire , and was eventually condemned by Roman bishop Victor .
However , in the eastern Roman empire , Adoptionism took hold in the latter half of the 3rd century .
The leader of eastern Adoptionism was the bishop of Antioch , Paul of Samosata .
Of him and his teaching , McGiffert writes :
. . .
Paul was the most important of all the Adoptionists and one of the most interesting figures in the early church .
. . .
The man Jesus Christ according to Paul was by no means an ordinary man .
On the contrary he was endowed at birth with the divine reason or wisdom ( Paul used the two words interchangeably ) and lived wholly at one with God , loving him unalterably and fulfilling his will perfectly in all things .
As a consequence , he was raised from the dead , was given divine authority , and was appointed to be the judge and saviour of men .
He is therefore now to be recognized as Lord and to be worshipped as such .
Paul was even willing that he should be given the name
God if it were clearly understood that he was not God in himself but had only been granted the title and the honour that went with it as a reward for his virtue and the constancy of his devotion to the divine will .
( pp. 241-242 , 243-244 , Ibid. )
After two earlier tries failed , Paul and his teaching were finally condemned at a synod held in Antioch in 268 CE .
He was deposed from his religious office and Adoptionism gradually gave way in the east to the Logos Christology .
McGiffert states this about the philosophical origins of the Logos Christology , the foundation for what later became Trinitarianism :
. . .
Platonic philosophy . . . came to expression in the Logos Christology .
At the end of the third century , the Logos Christology was generally accepted in all parts of the church and found a place in most of the creeds framed in that period , particularly in the east .
The motive underlying it was philosophical , the hostility to it was due chiefly to either religious or ethical considerations .
( pp. 241 , 244-245 , Ibid . )
The development of the Trinity doctrine was a response by scholars and theologians in the Roman Catholic Church to the heretical doctrines of Docetism , Modalism , and Adoptionism in all their different variations .
Trinitarianism began to take shape as a comprehensive doctrine in the 2nd century , but it took many hundreds of years to come to its final form .
Theophilus of Antioch seems to have been the first to use the Greek term for " trinity " ( τριά ς ) to describe God about 190 CE .
Initially , it appears that the main goal of the Catholic theologians was to establish the preexistence of the Son of God , his incarnation as the man Jesus Christ , and his deity .
However , as the Trinity doctrine was taking form , there continued to be disagreements over the nature of the Messiah by scholars within the Roman Catholic church .
This dissension eventually came to a head early in the 4th century CE due to the teaching of Lucian of Antioch .
Regarding this man and his doctrine , McGiffert writes :
Lucian was at the head of a theological school in Antioch when he suffered martyrdom in 311 .
He was a man of high standing and many of his pupils held prominent positions in the church of the east .
He was a disciple of Paul of Samosata , but he departed radically from the teaching of his master . . .
Like him he distinguished Christ sharply from God , but instead of counting him a mere man as Paul did , he made him the incarnation of a preexistent being whom he called the Logos or Son of God .
The Logos incarnate in Christ is not identical with the divine logos or reason which is a mere impersonal attribute or faculty , on the contrary he is a personal being intermediate between God and man and of another nature altogether .
. . . ( pp. 246-247 , Ibid . )
One of Lucian 's disciples was a presbyter from Alexandria , Egypt named Arius .
With respect to Arius ' position on the identity of Yeshua , McGiffert writes :
Arius was more of a rationalist than a mystic and his controlling interest was intellectual rather than religious .
God , he maintained , is one both in substance and in person .
His nature is indivisible and cannot be shared by any other being .
He is self - existent and eternal .
Everything else has been created out of nothing and had its beginning in time .
The Son of God was made out of nothing to be God 's agent in the creation of the world .
He is not eternal ; on the contrary he was created in time by an act of God 's will .
His nature is not identical with God's , any more than is the nature of other created things .
God is immutable ; the Son of God is subject to change .
God is eternally perfect ; the Son of God advances in wisdom and knowledge .
The Son of God may be called the Logos , but is to be sharply distinguished from the impersonal logos or reason which God always possessed .
Though Arius occasionally spoke of the Son in traditional fashion as begotten by the Father he used the term only as a synonym of created .
He was quite clear indeed that the Son was made out of nothing and did not partake of the divine essence in any sense .
The essence of the Son is his own and is identical neither with that of God nor with that of man .
The Son is the first of all creatures and belongs to a higher order of being than any others , whether angels or men .
He became incarnate in Jesus Christ , being born of a virgin and taking on human flesh . . . ( pp. 247-248 , Ibid . )
Regarding the source of the difference between the teaching of Arius and Catholic scholars championing the Trinity , ISBE states :
The Arian debate of the 4th cent .
centered from the very first on the right interpretation of Prov. 8:22-31 . . .
Origen had sometimes suggested that the logos , identified both with the preexistent Son of God and with wisdom , is a creature if wisdom is such in Prov. 8:22 ( cf. In Ioannem i.19.115 ) .
Arius made explicit this Origenist tendency to subordinate the Son metaphysically .
For him the Son of God ( identified with wisdom ) has not always existed in eternal generation , but " before eternal times " was brought into being by the Father .
Indeed ,
God cannot eternally communicate the divine essence to another , for God is absolutely simple and His essence therefore incommunicable .
The Son was in fact made by God .
He is a " second , " a perfect creature ( though eventually in principle fallible ) , the firstborn of all creation , intermediate -- a saving mediator -- between God and human beings .
( p. 918 , vol .
4 , The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia , " Trinity " )
About 319 CE Arius , a respected scholar and teacher , came into conflict with Alexander , the Bishop of Alexandria , over his teaching of Lucian 's doctrine regarding Christ .
In an informal discussion between Alexander and his presbyters , Arius accused Alexander of Sabellianism .
Soon thereafter , Bishop Alexander convened a council that condemned and exiled Arius .
Arius ' response to Alexander 's action was to write a letter to Eusebius of Nicomedia .
In his letter , he complained of being wrongly persecuted by Alexander .
Here is an excerpt from the letter that documents the doctrines of Alexander regarding the Son of God :
. . .
The bishop greatly wastes and persecutes us , and leaves no stone unturned against us .
He has driven us out of the city as atheists , because we do not concur in what he publicly preaches , namely , God always , the Son always ; as the Father so the Son ; the Son co-exists unbegotten with the God ;
He is everlasting ; neither by thought nor by any interval does God precede the Son ; always God , always Son ; he is begotten of the unbegotten ; the Son is of God Himself .
( p. 41 , bk .
I , ch. IV , ser .
II , vol .
III , Nicene and Post - Nicene Fathers , " The Ecclesiastical History of Theodoret " )
The letter also mentions that several eastern bishops ( Eusebius of Caesarea , Theodotus of Laodicea , Paulinus of Tyre , Athanasius of Anazarbus , Gregorius of Berytus , and Aetius of Lydda ) had been condemned by Alexander for teachings similar to those of Arius .
At about the same time , Alexander wrote the Catholic Epistle ; in this letter , he informed his colleagues that Eusebius of Nicomedia was also spreading the heresy of Arius .
He warned the Catholic bishops not to fall into apostasy by accepting the teachings of Arius and Eusebius .
Shortly thereafter , Eusebius invited Arius to Nicomedia and began a letter writing campaign to the bishops of Asia Minor in support of Arius and his position .
Due to Eusebius ' steadfast and outspoken support of Arius , the " Arian controversy " was changed from an Egyptian dispute into a controversy that affected the fledgling Catholic church .
The next year ( 320 CE ) while in Nicomedia , Arius drafted a letter to Alexander and summarized his views once more .
Arius also wrote
The Banquet while there , which was probably an attempt to widely publish his doctrine .
However , this work survives today only in fragments found primarily in quotations from the writings of Athanasius .
In 324 CE , Alexander again sent a letter to bishops outside of Egypt warning of the danger from Arius ' doctrine .
By this time , Roman Emperor Constantine had recognized that the doctrinal battle within the Roman Catholic church had to be settled or the newly - recognized religion would be splintered by factional fighting .
Since the Arian position had the least support among the bishops , Constantine sought to resolve the issue in favor of the majority position .
Early in 325 CE , a representative of Emperor Constantine named Hosius presided over a council in Antioch .
This anti-Arian council condemned Eusebius , Bishop of Caesarea , for being an Arian sympathizer .
It also formulated a doctrinal creed in favor of Alexander 's theological position on the nature of the Godhead .
Later in the same year , another council was held in the city of Nicea .
There were 318 Catholic bishops in attendance , the majority of which were opposed to Arius ' teaching .
The position of these bishops was presented by a young deacon from Alexandria , Athanasius .
In the end , Athanasius ' arguments won out and Arius was exiled to Illyria .
An anti-Arian creed ( the Nicene Creed ) was adopted by the council .
Below is the text of the Nicene Creed :
We believe in one God , the Father Almighty , maker of all things visible and invisible ; and in one Lord Jesus Christ , the Son of God , the only - begotten of his Father , of the substance of the Father , God of God , Light of Light , very God of very God , begotten not made , being of one substance ( homoousios ) with the Father .
By whom all things were made , both which is in heaven and in earth .
Who for us men and for our salvation came down [ from heaven ] and was incarnate and was made man .
He suffered and the third day he rose again , ascended into heaven .
And he shall come again to judge both the living and the dead .
And [ we believe ] in the Holy Ghost .
And whosoever shall say that there was a time when the Son of God was not , or that before he was begotten he was not , or that he was made of things that were not , or that he is of a different substance or essence [ from the Father ] or that he is a creature , or subject to change or conversion ―all that so say , the Catholic and Apostolic Church anathematizes them .
( p. 3 , ser .
II , vol .
XIV , Nicene and Post - Nicene Fathers )
However , the adoption of the Nicene Creed did not truly solve the dispute .
In fact , looking back , it seems that Arius ' setback was only temporary .
In 327 he wrote a letter to Emperor Constantine , trying to show the orthodoxy of his position and asking him to revoke his banishment .
Shortly after receiving the letter , Constantine rescinded Arius ' exile .
In 335 , the Synod of Tyre and Jerusalem restored Arius into the Roman Catholic church , and Athanasius was deposed .
Emperor Constantine agreed with the recommendation of that council , and in February 336 , Athanasius was exiled to Trier .
On May 22 , 337 , Constantine was baptized by Arian supporter Eusebius of Nicomedia on his deathbed .
Several church councils and ten Arian confessions of belief did not solve the issue .
The First Council of Constantinople was convened in 381 CE to review the Arian controversy again .
Under the guidance of Gregory of Nazianzus , the Nicene Creed was reevaluated and accepted with the addition of articles on the Holy Spirit and other matters .
Thus Trinitarianism was finally formalized by the Roman Catholic church late in the 4th century at Constantinople .
However , the Trinitarianism we now see took many more centuries to come to its final form .
To define the modern Trinity doctrine , let 's go to the Roman Catholic church , its originator :
The Trinity is the term employed to signify the central doctrine of the Christian religion -- the truth that in the unity of the Godhead there are Three Persons , the Father , the Son , and the Holy Spirit , these Three Persons being truly distinct one from another .
Thus , in the words of the Athanasian Creed : " the Father is God , the Son is God , and the Holy Spirit is God , and yet there are not three Gods but one God . "
In this Trinity of Persons the Son is begotten of the Father by an eternal generation , and the Holy Spirit proceeds by an eternal procession from the Father and the Son .
Yet , notwithstanding this difference as to origin , the Persons are co-eternal and co-equal : all alike are uncreated and omnipotent .
This , the Church teaches , is the revelation regarding God 's nature which Jesus Christ , the Son of God , came upon earth to deliver to the world : and which she proposes to man as the foundation of her whole dogmatic system .
In Scripture there is as yet no single term by which the Three Divine Persons are denoted together .
. . . ( vol. 15 , Catholic Encyclopedia , 1912 , " The Blessed Trinity " )
The modern position of Trinitarianism regarding the identity of the Messiah has been distilled down to the doctrinal statement " Jesus Christ - fully God , fully man . "
Belief in the Trinity is considered to an article of faith , because this doctrine is regarded as an unfathomable and unknowable mystery .
Regarding this so - called divine mystery , Christian scholar Walter Martin wrote :
No man can fully explain the Trinity , though in every age scholars have propounded theories and advanced hypotheses to explore this mysterious Biblical teaching .
But despite the worthy efforts of these scholars , the Trinity is still largely incomprehensible to the mind of man .
( p. 21 , Essential Christianity )
However , as we 've seen from the sources cited above , the origin and status of Yeshua were clearly not understood in a Trinitarian framework by early Christians .
It was n't until several centuries after Christ walked the earth that the Trinity became the official church explanation for Yeshua 's relationship to the Father .
The writings of some of the early " fathers " of the Catholic church show that they did not subscribe to the later Trinitarian belief in the co-eternality and co-equality of the Father , Son , and Holy Spirit , as the Catholic Encyclopedia itself admits :
. . .
A vigorous controversy has been carried on from the end of the seventeenth century to the present day regarding the Trinitarian doctrine of the ante-Nicene Fathers .
The Socinian writers of the seventeenth century ( e. g. Sand , " Nucleus historiae ecclesiastic " , Amsterdam , 1668 ) asserted that the language of the early Fathers in many passages of their works shows that they agreed not with Athanasius , but with Arius . . . .
Those who take the less favourable view assert that they teach the following points inconsistent with the post - Nicene belief of the Church : That the Son even as regards His Divine Nature is inferior and not equal to the Father ;
that the Son alone appeared in the theophanies of the Old Testament , inasmuchas the Father is essentially invisible , the Son , however , not so ;
that the Son is a created being ;
that the generation of the Son is not eternal , but took place in time .
( vol. 15 , Catholic Encyclopedia , 1912 , " The Blessed Trinity " )
The following quote from Margaret Barker confirms the claims of the Socinian writers :
Origen explained that Jesus was ' not simply an angel but the Angel of Great Counsel ' ( Against Celsus V.53 , cf. VIII.27 ) .
Eusebius knew that this was not a Christian innovation ; the anointed heavenly figure was the Angel of great Counsel : ' And when as the Captain of the Angels he leads them he is called : The Angel of Great Counsel , and as Leader of the Armies of heaven : Captain of the Host of the Lord ' ( Proof IV.10 ) .
The Hebrews , he said , also believed that this angel was the Messiah ( Preparation VII.14-15 ) , but the difference between the Jews and the Christians was that the Jews did not believe that he had already appeared .
This implies that the belief in two deities in the Old Testament was not unique to Christians ; the point of dispute was whether or not Jesus was the second God.
Elsewhere Christ was the ' first among the archangels ' , and ' being himself God , the Commander in Chief and Shepherd of all that is in heaven ' , all rational creatures gave him homage ( Methodius , Symposium iii .
4 , 6 ) .
Melito named him as the captain of the angelic army ( New Fragments 15 ) .
Justin listed the titles as ' the Glory of the Lord , at another time a Son , at another Wisdom , at another an Angel , at another God , and at another Lord and Word .
He once calls himself Captain of the Host when he appeared to Joshua the son of Nun in the form of man ' ( Trypho 61 ) . ( p. 207 , The Great Angel )
The central tenet of modern Trinitarianism is that God the Father , God the Son , and God the Holy Spirit are co-eternal and co-equal .
This contention , however , has been a sticking point throughout the centuries as theological philosophers have argued about the nature of the Godhead .
The doctrine of the Trinity is at odds with the scriptural teaching regarding the Messiah and is contradicted by early Jewish and Christian literature .
The Scriptures themselves clearly show that Jesus Christ is not co-eternal and co-equal with the Most High , God the Father .
The teaching of the New Testament on the identity of Jesus Christ will be explored in detail in the second part of this study , " The New Testament Identification of the Messiah . "

The human spaceflight program is in your hands , Mr. President .
The blue - ribbon panel President Obama appointed to look into NASA 's human spaceflight plans is done with its work , posting the final report to its website Thursday .
Weighing in at 157 pages , it examined the Bush - era Constellation program from top to bottom , although it released most of its key findings last month in an executive summary .
Top among them is that NASA does not have enough money to fund a human spaceflight program .
The agency needs at least $ 3 billion more each year to accomplish the goals of exploring beyond low - earth orbit , while maintaining the International Space Station and other scientific programs .
While the entire human spaceflight program costs each citizen a mere seven cents per day , according to the report , getting more money for NASA has been a struggle .
There are signs , though , that the Obama administration could provide a little more cash for human space exploration .
" [ Obama ] has assured me NASA will get enough money to do what it does best :
Go explore the heavens , " Bill Nelson , Senator from Florida said in a YouTube message to his constituents .
The panel , led by Norm Augustine , has not received a warm welcome from some members of Congress .
Congress had already expressed its support for NASA 's current path , so the Obama administration 's attempt to rethink that plan struck many as unnecessary at best , deleterious to the space program at worst .
" While I look forward to reading the Augustine panel ’s final report , Congress has already made its decisions on the issues considered by the panel , " said Gabrielle Giffords , a Democrat from Arizona , who heads the House subcommittee on Space , in a statement sent to Wired.com .
" Now that both internal and external independent reviews have confirmed that the Constellation program is being well executed , we know what needs to be done .
Let ’s get on with it and cease contemplating our collective navels . "
Giffords , who is married to a former NASA astronaut , did indicate that she looked forward to working with Obama to " usher in a grand new era of exploration and science . "
The Obama administration did not tip its hand about when or what its ultimate plans for space might be .
" The President has on numerous occasions confirmed his commitment to human space exploration , and the goal of ensuring that the nation is on a vigorous and sustainable path to achieving our boldest aspirations in space , " said Nick Shapiro , a White House spokesman , in an e-mail to Wired.com .
" Against a backdrop of serious challenges with the existing program , the Augustine Committee has offered several key findings and a range of options for how the nation might improve its future human space flight activities . "
Three key bones of contention remain between the Augustine panel and members of the House like Giffords .
The first is the role of commercial space companies like Bigelow and SpaceX in taking astronauts to low - earth Orbit .
The Augustine panel had a rather bullish view on their capabilities .
" There is little doubt that the U.S. aerospace industry , from historical builders of human spacecraft to the new entrants , has the technical capability to build and operate a crew taxi to low - Earth orbit , " they wrote .
Giffords , meanwhile , said she wanted to make " clear that we are not prepared to have our astronauts ' access to space held hostage to purchases of seats from non-existent commercial providers . "
A second disagreement exists over the role of the Ares I rocket .
Most of the Augustine members felt that it was an unwise investment .
Instead , they recommended that a modified version of a heavier rocket , the Ares V Lite , should be used for trips to the moon .
That would effectively kill the Ares I program , begun under Scott " Doc " Horowitz , who left the agency in 2007 .
" The Committee finds the Ares V Lite used in the dual mode for lunar missions to be the preferred reference case , " they wrote .
The House Science and Technology Committee chair , Bart Gordon , a Democrat from Tennessee , on the other hand , implicitly argued for the status quo , absent any findings of malfeasance .
Just provide " adequate resources " and leave the program alone .
" [ The Augustine ] panel had assessed NASA 's Constellation program and found it to be ' well managed ' and a program that is ' executable and would carry out its objectives ' if adequate resources are provided . "
The last major difference between the Augustine commission and what Congress voted for in Constellation is the way NASA would get back to Mars .
The Bush vision was to land on the moon first , learn from that experience , and head to Mars .
The report gives a tepid endorsement of the viability of the plan .
" A long - duration exploration of the Moon is a step towards Mars , but not a giant step , and not the only possible step , " they wrote .
The Augustine report clearly favors a different option they term the " Flexible Path , " which would prioritize getting to near - earth objects first , then allow for landing - less trips to the Moon or Mars .
On the criteria they created to evaluate the program , the Flexible Path clearly outscores the program of record ( see image above ) .
Giffords , again , was ready with a response saying , " In endorsing the Constellation architecture , Congress made clear that it saw a return to the Moon as just the first step in a flexible program of human and robotic exploration of the solar system . "
Even with this long - awaited report in hand , the future of NASA 's human spaceflight program will remain murky until the Obama administration — or its Office for Science and Technology Policy — makes a move .
An OSTP spokesman declined to comment on the report and White House spokesman , Shapiro , could not provide a timeline for a decision .
The wheels , though , could already be turning at NASA .
Spaceflight.com reported that Administrator Charles Bolden requested that a team at Marshall Spaceflight Center look into an alternative set of heavy - lift rockets known as Jupiter .
And he lauded commercial space companies in a speech to the National Association of Investment Companies earlier this week .
" What these companies , and others , are doing is nothing short of inspirational , " Bolden said .
" Today , we at NASA are devising ways to work with these companies and others who will come . "

The New York Civil Liberties Union today filed a friend - of - the - court brief in the Appellate Division , Second Department supporting Governor David A. Paterson ’ s recent appointment of Richard Ravitch as lieutenant governor .
The brief in Skelos v. Paterson argues that the constitutional right to a republican form of government embraces the promise of a functioning legislature , but during the month preceding the Ravitch appointment the New York State Senate stopped functioning .
The Ravitch appointment assisted in breaking the legislative logjam and helped restore representative democracy to the voters and taxpayers of this state .
The courts should consider this corrective measure undertaken by the governor , the NYCLU argues , as it balances the equities in this case .
The New York Civil Liberties Union today filed a friend - of - the - court brief in the Appellate Division , Second Department supporting Governor David A. Paterson ’ s recent appointment of Richard Ravitch as lieutenant governor .
The brief in Skelos v. Paterson argues that the constitutional right to a republican form of government embraces the promise of a functioning legislature , but during the month preceding the Ravitch appointment the New York State Senate stopped functioning .
The Ravitch appointment assisted in breaking the legislative logjam and helped restore representative democracy to the voters and taxpayers of this state .
The courts should consider this corrective measure undertaken by the governor , the NYCLU argues , as it balances the equities in this case .
“ The collapse of the State Senate deprived voters and taxpayers of their constitutional right to a functioning legislature during a time of unprecedented fiscal difficulty , ” NYCLU Executive Director Donna Lieberman said .
“ By appointing Richard Ravitch lieutenant governor , Governor Paterson acted lawfully to restore this fundamental right to New Yorkers . ”
After Paterson appointed Ravitch lieutenant governor last month , State Sens. Dean Skelos , R - Rockville Centre , and Pedro Espada Jr. , D - Bronx , filed a lawsuit in Nassau County to block the appointment .
Paterson argues that Ravitch ’s appointment was authorized by the Public Officers Law , which allows the governor to fill vacancies in elective offices .
His opponents contend that the Public Officers Law is superseded by a provision of the New York State Constitution , which assigns the president pro tempore of the State Senate the duties of lieutenant governor during a vacancy .
The NYCLU brief offers an alternative argument for sustaining the position of the governor .
This argument rests upon the federal constitution promise of representative democracy and functioning legislatures in each state .
“ The Senate impasse constituted a severe breakdown of representative democracy that endangered the constitutional rights of all New Yorkers , ” said Arthur Eisenberg , NYCLU legal director .
“ The governor acted to end the stalemate and provide voters and taxpayers the government to which they are entitled under the federal Constitution . ”

An article published Online First and in a future edition of The Lancet reports that hormone replacement therapy ( HRT ) using oestrogen and progestin increases the risk of death from lung cancer .
This finding should be included into risk - benefit consideration for women considering HRT .
It is especially essential for women at high risk of lung cancer .
The article is the work of Professor Rowan Chlebowski , of the Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute at Harbour - UCLA Medical Center , Torrance , CA , USA , and colleagues .
Data from the Women ’s Health Initiative ( WHI ) trial was studied .
This large trial , of HRT ( oestrogen plus progestin ) in postmenopausal women , was stopped prematurely when health risks were found to outweigh benefits .
Follow - up after an average of 5.6 years showed that participants assigned to HRT had higher risks of cardiovascular disease , coronary heart disease , stroke , venous thromboembolism , and breast cancer , and lower risks of fractures and colorectal cancers than did women assigned to placebo .
Between study groups , all - cause mortality did not fluctuate .
In addition , results from further follow - up of an additional 2.4 years ( totalling 8 years of monitoring ) suggested that the combined hormone therapy might increase mortality from lung cancer .
In order to corroborate this association , the authors evaluated the number of lung cancers diagnosed in the trial over the whole follow - up period .
The WHI study involved 16,608 postmenopausal women aged 50 to 79 years with an intact uterus .
It was a randomised controlled trial that took place in 40 centres in the USA .
A group of 8,506 women received a once - daily tablet of 0.625 mg conjugated equine oestrogen plus 2.5 mg medroxyprogesterone acetate .
The other group of 8,102 women received matching placebo .
After the 8 years total follow - up the researchers found that more women died from lung cancer in the combined hormone therapy group than in the placebo group ( 73 compared to 40 deaths ) .
In other words , women in the HRT group were 71 percent more likely to die .
This was mostly as a result of a higher number of deaths from non-small - cell lung cancer ( NSCLC ) in the combined therapy group ( 62 compared to 31 deaths ) .
Women in the HRT group were 87 percent more likely to die particularly of NSCLC .
In addition , women in the HRT group were 28 percent more likely to be diagnosed with lung cancer than those given placebo , although this finding was not statistically significant .
Between groups , incidence and mortality rates of small - cell lung cancer were comparable .
Dr. Rowan T. Chlebowski , MD , PhD , Los Angeles Biomedical Research Institute ( LA BioMed ) chief of oncology and author of the study comments : ” Postmenopausal women , especially current smokers or long - term past smokers , should carefully consider these new lung cancer findings before initiating or continuing combined estrogen plus progestin use . ”
The authors write in conclusion : “ Treatment with oestrogen plus progestin in postmenopausal women … increased the number of deaths from lung cancer , in particular deaths from non -small - cell lung cancer .
These findings should be incorporated into risk - benefit discussions with women considering combined hormone therapy , especially those with a high risk of lung cancer …such as current smokers or long - term past smokers . ”
In a supplementary note , Dr Apar Kishor Ganti , University of Nebraska Medical Center , Omaha , NE , USA , remarks : “ Because the optimum safe duration of hormone - replacement therapy in terms of lung - cancer survival is unclear , such therapy should probably be avoided in women at a high risk of developing lung cancer , especially those with a history of smoking .
These results , along with the findings showing no protection against coronary heart disease , seriously question whether hormone - replacement therapy has any role in medicine today .
It is difficult to presume that the benefits of routine use of such therapy for menopausal symptoms outweigh the increased risks of mortality , especially in the absence of improvement in the quality of life . ”

The Mondragón Cooperative Corporation ( MCC ) , the largest consortium of worker - owned companies , has developed a different way of doing business — a way that puts workers , not shareholders , first .
Here ’s how it played out when one of the Mondragón cooperatives fell on hard times .
The worker / owners and the managers met to review their options .
After three days of meetings , the worker / owners agreed that 20 percent of the workforce would leave their jobs for a year , during which they would continue to receive 80 percent of their pay and , if they wished , free training for other work .
This group would be chosen by lottery , and if the company was still in trouble a year later , the first group would return to work and a second would take a year off .
The result ?
The solution worked and the company thrives to this day .
The philosophy that emerged put the rights and well - being of workers first .
The central importance of workers permeates every aspect of the Mondragón Cooperatives .
Even though the MCC businesses are affected by the global financial crisis , there is no unemployment within the MCC businesses .
People are moved around to other jobs , or hours are cut without cutting pay .
The wages for unworked hours are to be repaid through extra hours worked later in the year .
Contrary to what some advocates of top - down management say , this worker - centered focus has n’t been an obstacle to growth .
Founded in 1956 by Father Don Jose Arizmendi , a Basque Catholic priest , the Mondragón cooperatives today comprise more than 100 cooperatives , as well as more than 100 subsidiaries that MCC has purchased and hopes to convert .
Altogether , MCC companies employ more than 100,000 worker / owners and in 2007 generated revenues of more than $ 24 billion .
This empire of egalitarianism grew from humble roots .
Father Arizmendi brought together the residents of this Basque community through study circles and workshops .
His aim was to confront high levels of unemployment that kept the region in poverty and isolation .
The philosophy that emerged from those meetings put the rights and well - being of workers first , with growth mainly aimed at providing additional jobs and job security to employees .
These principles drive everyday practice at MCC companies .
For instance , while most businesses determine voting power based on how many company shares a person owns , MCC cooperatives allocate each worker one vote .
They also stick to an egalitarian pay scale — top management is rarely paid more than six times the lowest - paid worker .
Profits and losses are distributed among all the members equitably because their efforts together determine the success of the company .
Co-op Entrepreneurs
At the same time , the MCC has never lost sight of the fact that it ca n’t generate high - quality well - paying jobs , without innovation and creativity .
To that end , MCC managers in 1981 founded SAIOLAN , an incubator program that aims to create new companies and products by bringing together would - be entrepreneurs with identified needs , and helping out with feasibility studies and prototypes .
The result has been rates of innovation that challenge those of the world ’s most successful corporations .
A Mondragón firm manufactured Spain ’s first computer chips , for example .
Others are producing wind , solar , and hydrogen power .
New business opportunities in health and food , communications , and alternative energy are now being researched , as well as shared housing for elders and furniture convenient for older people .
The company estimates that fully a quarter of the products its cooperatives will make in 2012 are not yet in production .
SAIOLAN also offers budding entrepreneurs coaching , technical resources , funding , and help with business plans .
To date , it has helped 285 entrepreneurs create their own companies and many others to develop their ideas within existing co-ops .
Capital & Globalization
Not surprisingly , running a huge cooperative involves a host of challenges .
One that has been with MCC from the start is the difficulty of raising capital to start new businesses .
Without capitalists to own the companies , there ’s no obvious source for the big money required to get a business off the ground .
Worker - members do buy into their jobs , but it does n’t generate enough capital to start up a brick - and - mortar business like manufacturing .
The MCC developed a unique solution : Starting with the first affiliated cooperative 50 years ago , workers ’ shares of company profits have been paid into capital accounts that stay within the company until the workers retire .
The funds were originally pooled in the Caja Laboral bank , owned by MCC member businesses .
These accounts are now managed by MCC , and the bank operates as another member cooperative , with 389 branches located in all parts of Spain .
The bank ’s entrepreneurial division creates new businesses and offers microcredit to young people in the Basque region to assist them in developing businesses .
Contrary to what some advocates of top - down management say , this worker - centered focus has n’t been an obstacle to growth .
As the co-ops have spread to other parts of Spain and abroad , the percentage of workers who are also owners has fallen .
Approximately 9 percent of employees are not worker / owners — most from outside of the Basque region .
Many of them work in Eroski , the largest supermarket chain in Spain .
These workers will soon have an opportunity to become owners , however .
At the January 2009 General Assembly of the MCC , the decision was made to open membership to non-Basques in other regions of Spain , and these workers are now being invited to join as worker / owners .
To keep supplier contracts with global partners and avoid import tariffs , Mondragón has purchased local subsidiaries in countries such as China and Brazil .
These relationships have strengthened local employment but created a new problem : a growing body of international non-member workers .
Cooperatives with foreign subsidiaries are experimenting with ways to ensure good working conditions and extend the principles of employee participation in management , profits , and ownership .
But to date , the co-ops have not found a way to offer full membership to the workers in the international subsidiaries .
A New Way of Life ?
One of the first things you notice while driving from the Bilbao Airport toward the town of Mondragón is the unspoiled beauty of the countryside — rolling green hills uninterrupted by billboards , and smooth roads untarnished by potholes .
The town of Mondragón , population 23,000 , is solidly middle class .
There were neither mansions on the hill nor poverty in the streets .
We did n’t see wealth but everyone had a comfortable place to live , healthy food to eat , and the comfort of modern conveniences .
Equally noticeable was their convivial , even joyful sense of community .
The people we met were friendly , conversational , and trusting .
Mondragón is proof that a commitment to the common good is not an obstacle to commercial success .
Instead , a dedication to innovation and training at all levels can bring forward the best of the community .
That quality of life continues outside the workplace , multiplying the benefits for those who choose a cooperative path .
Prepare yourself for the stupidest movie pitch you 'll ever hear in your entire life .
Update : now with alternate title suggestions !
So I was browsing a rather good article on RottenTomatoes.com about horror starlets past and present , in honour of the release of cruddy slasher , Sorority Row .
That 's when I stumbled on the synopsis for a new film called Burning Bright .
Strap yourselves in , because this website is about to go full retard .
Released in late 2009 , from the producer of Big Momma 's House no less , Burning Bright is a thriller starring Briana Evigan , the daughter of Greg Evigan from TV's My Two Dads and When Things Get Knocked Over , Spill , Or Fall Out Of Cupboards .
But what 's it about , I hear you ask ?
I 'll let the official synopsis do the talking :
" When 20 year - old Kelly wakes late at night during a hurricane , she finds a hungry tiger stalking her through the halls of her home .
With every door and window boarded up from the outside and her stepfather nowhere to be found , Kelly fights to stay one step ahead of the killer beast while dragging her autistic brother Tom through the house . "
Yep , it 's about a girl protecting her AUTISTIC BROTHER from a fucking TIGER during a fucking HURRICANE .
Also starring fucking MEAT LOAF .
I 'm not going to lie to you guys .
This sounds fucking AWESOME .
I 'm crying tears of ironic joy through all three eyes .
All it needs is a Nic Cage cameo then I know I 'm dreaming .
Burning Bright is so high concept it makes Snakes On A Plane look like a Ken Loach film .
It 's like they saw the tiger scenes in The Hangover and thought , " This comedy would be much scarier if it was set during Hurricane Katrina and Bradley Cooper was developmentally disabled " .
Thanks to ShockTilYouDrop for the synopsis .
Bloody Disgusting have pics you just gotta see .
Update : Commenter Luke suggested that the title ' Burning Bright ' is not suitable for a movie with such awesome subject material .
The current frontrunner is ' Tigopath ' .
Can you do better ?

NEW YORK , July 14 ( Reuters ) - U.S. government officials are weighing a plan that would let borrowers who have fallen behind on their mortgage payments avoid eviction by renting their homes instead , sources familiar with the administration ’s thinking said on Tuesday .
Under one idea being discussed , delinquent homeowners would surrender ownership of their homes but would continue to live in the property for several years , the sources told Reuters .
Officials are also considering whether the government should make mortgage payments on behalf of borrowers who cannot keep up with their home loans , tapping an unused portion of a $ 50 billion housing aid kitty .
As part of this plan , jobless borrowers might receive a housing stipend along with regular unemployment benefits , the sources said .

Significant education news : the University of Texas is announcing a statewide initiative in Second Life that will connect to the states ' 16 campuses , with a program " that emphasizes teaching in the areas of science / math , international / intercultural , and health / medical , among other areas . "
( Here 's the official blog . )
Appropriate to the largest state in the US , and a university system with 200K students , the virtual campus will range over 49 islands and include distance learning initiatives .
It 's billed as " the nation ’s first university system to roll out a virtual learning environment statewide , " and centered at the University of Texas at Austin .
UT / Austin is a major hub for high tech and artistic innovation , and serves as a major starting point for the country 's architects , filmmakers , game designers , computer industry staff , etc. etc. and is a major reason Austin has such a rich film / game / live music community .
So as students in those areas engage with the SL campus , it 's easy to imagine them spinning off metaverse projects of their own , as they graduate .
Before all that happens , however , the campus has to be built in SL -- I can't find it in - world , and no SLurl accompanies any of the many announcements I 've read .
Stand by for that .
Update , 1:10 pm : Much more detail on the Lindens ' blog .
Still no SLurl though .
While many people have been loudly celebrating this year 's double commemoration of 200 years since Charles Darwin 's birth and 150 years since the publication of On the Origin of Species , another scientific anniversary has crept up relatively quietly , marking an event which arguably changed human thought and the way we see ourselves even more irrevocably .
Exactly 400 years ago today , on 25 August 1609 , the Italian astronomer and philosopher Galilei Galileo showed Venetian merchants his new creation , a telescope – the instrument that was to bring him both scientific immortality and , more immediately , a whole lot of trouble .
A refinement of models first devised in the Netherlands , Galileo 's slim , brown stick was puny even by the standards of something one might buy in a hobby shop today .
But his eight - powered telescope , and the more powerful models he soon produced , when pointed skywards led Galileo to a series of groundbreaking conclusions .
The moon was not , as long believed , completely smooth .
Another planet , Jupiter , also had moons .
Meanwhile Venus showed a range of moon - like phases , something which could not happen if both it and the sun orbited the Earth .
This latter phenomenon had been predicted by Nicolaus Copernicus when , nearly a century before , he had proposed the notion of a planetary system with the sun at the centre , not the Earth .
Galileo's discoveries were , perhaps predictably , not best welcomed by the Catholic church , and he spent the final decade of his life under house arrest .
It was certainly a revelation which upset the orthodoxies – and the churches – at least as much as Darwin's , and perhaps merits a bit more of a fuss , although museum - goers in Philadelphia and Stockholm can view one of Galileo 's very early telescopes , on loan this year from Florence .
A good deal more people are likely to be alerted thanks to Google 's day - long adaptation of their main page logo to a Google Doodle in honour of the event .

Coffee beans can't be grown just anywhere .
Most of the year must provide moderate sunshine and rainfall .
Thus virtually all coffee in the world is produced within the coffee belt that lies between the Tropic of Cancer to the north and the Tropic of Capricorn to the south .
Coffee 's monetary value is said to be second only to oil among natural commodities .
And for those who fuel up on Starbucks caffeine or the like , the price per gallon paid far exceeds what is spent filling your car 's gas tank .
For generations of Americans , Colombia 's Juan Valdez symbolized coffee production and Colombia is still the number two producer in the world behind Brazil .
Located right next door to these coffee producing giants is Venezuela , a country that at one time rivaled Colombia in coffee production .
And although blessed with the required porous soil and perfect climate , Venezuela now produces less than one percent of the world 's coffee — not even enough to satisfy its own population .
After being one of the top coffee exporters early in the 20th century , Venezuela began importing java from Brazil last month , even though , as Benedict Mander reports for the Financial Times , " locals say it is no match for the local quality Arabica beans . "
So despite having the best beans and the perfect conditions to grow them , Venezuela is almost out of the coffee business .
One of the stock answers given is that after oil was discovered in 1960s and ' 70s coffee growing withered because the nation became South America 's richest by pumping crude .
But coffee growing in Venezuela has always been dominated by family farms .
It 's not as if coffee farmers dug up their coffee plants and started drilling for oil .
Instead , the power of the Venezuelan government did the digging in the name of land reform — supposedly for the betterment of working people .
" Land reform is a weapon aimed at the heart of the oligarchy , " The Marxist wrote in 2006 , " and from the inception of the new land programme , land owners , capitalists and their supporters in the national and international media have organised against the threat of agrarian change . "
But change came when the Land Act was passed in December 2001 , and since then the National Land Institute has distributed millions of acres of lands to peasant - owned cooperatives in the " war against the latifundia . "
The Venezuelan government 's redistribution of land has , in the FT 's words , " generated a climate of uncertainty that has damped investment . "
So instead of planting beans , the land is left fallow or turned into pasture , reducing the supply and pushing up the price of coffee , right ?
Well no , because the government has imposed price ceilings at the retail level .
So there is no incentive for farmers to grow beans and many roasters just closed up shop .
What few coffee farms and roasters are left smuggle their product across the border to Colombia where the prices are n't controlled by President Hugo Chavez and are twice as high .
And while coffee prices are capped , the growers ' costs are rising .
Labor is hard to find at a reasonable wage , because " too many labourers live off government handouts and do n't even bother working , " one farm owner told the FT .
With his people clamoring for their caffeine fixes , Chavez has expropriated his country 's two largest coffee roasters , Fama de América and Café Madrid , blaming these companies for the scarcity , claiming that the roasters were hoarding , speculating , and smuggling .
" We 've had enough of this .
We must do the same with all companies that behave this way , " says Chavez .
" We are going to continue nationalizing monopolies to turn them into productive businesses in the hands of the workers , the people , the revolution . "
Ludwig von Mises , however , points out in Human Action that
the effect of [ the state 's ] interference is that people are prevented from using their knowledge and abilities , their labor and their material means of production in the way in which they would earn the highest returns and satisfy their needs as much as possible .
" Such interference , " he adds , " makes people poorer and less satisfied . "
Meanwhile , here in America , President Obama insists that all people need access to medical care , believing that healthcare " should be a right for every American . "
There was a time not too long ago when America 's healthcare was considered the best in the world and it was affordable to all .
" Instead , " as Gabriel E. Vidal wrote recently on Mises.org , " health costs reflect the distortions that government regulators have introduced through reimbursement mechanisms created by command - and - control bureaucracies at federal and state levels . "
In a 2007 Democratic debate , Obama said , " My emphasis is on driving down the costs , taking on the insurance companies , making sure that they are limited in the ability to extract profits and deny coverage , and the drug companies have to do what 's right by their patients instead of simply hoarding their profits . "
" [ The hills in Venezuela ] used to be carpeted with coffee plants , " a sad Don Luis Paparoni told the FT .
" Now you 'll scarcely find any . "
It will indeed be sad when quality healthcare becomes just as scarce in America .
The bankruptcy estate of Lehman Brothers Holdings Inc. accused some former executives of working with Barclays PLC to give the U.K. bank a " windfall " of at least $ 8.2 billion when it bought Lehman 's broker - dealer business during a frantic sale last fall .
The Lehman estate , which represents the interests of the firm 's creditors , accused its own former executives of helping move billions of dollars to the U.K. bank , in part to curry favor with their prospective employer .

The use of the guillotine on Dáil debates 13 times last week makes it very difficult to respect Government politicians , writes FINTAN O'TOOLE .
THERE ARE messers in every job but most people take pride in their labour .
They have standards and wo n’t allow themselves to do shoddy work .
But there is one exception to this rule , one profession that has such abject self - contempt that there is nothing it will not do .
Sadly for the rest of us , that profession is parliamentary politics .
Every so often , I start to feel a little sorry for TDs .
Most of them are decent , well - motivated people .
They get saddled with the incompatible expectations of an electorate that wants them to be local ward - healers and national legislators and as a result they lead a pretty terrible life .
Give them something to do ( like a serious parliamentary committee with actual powers ) and they turn out to be , on the whole , far more competent than is generally assumed .
I tell myself that the broad contempt in which they are held is often unfair and corrosive of democracy .
A desire to give them a break begins to soften the heart .
And then they go and spoil it all with a week like last week in which TDs collectively , and Government backbenchers in particular , could not have shown less self - respect if they had painted polka dots on their naked bodies , stuck feathers up their rear - ends and hung up a day - glo sign over Leinster House saying “ Will do tricks for
money ” .
If you think I ’m exaggerating , force yourself to read the Dáil proceedings for any given day last week .
You might start out believing that there is a separation of powers in which the executive ( the Government ) is held to account by the legislature .
Half an hour in the company of the proceedings of our august parliament will have you convinced that the Dáil ’s relationship to government is more Max Mosley than Montesquieu .
Its anthem is not Amhrán na bhFiannbut Hit Me Baby One More Time .
Over the course of the week , the Government used the guillotine on parliamentary debates a total of 13 times .
What a guillotine means is that government amendments to legislation which have not yet been debated are deemed to have been passed and the whole Bill is then put to a vote which the government wins .
Laws get on the statute books , affecting the lives of every citizen , which have had minimal or no scrutiny .
Parliament effectively ceases to function .
Look at a few instances of this charade .
At the end of the previous week , a vote was called on the second stage of the Criminal Justice Amendment Bill , a highly controversial piece of legislation that fundamentally alters the right to trial by jury .
Whether one agrees with the Bill or not , no one would argue that it is anything other than a very serious change in the nature of Irish criminal law .
The second stage division went like this on Tuesday morning .
The Ceann Comhairle puts the motion that “ the Bill be now read a second time ” .
He calls for those deputies seeking a division to stand .
Three Sinn Féin
TDs get to their feet .
As there are fewer than 10 deputies seeking a vote , the motion is declared carried .
A raft of Government and Opposition amendments to the Bill were supposed to be debated .
Even when they did get an airing , it would be flattering to call the debate cursory .
Government amendment number two , for example , creates a long and complex list of suspicious items whose possession can be used as evidence of a crime .
The amendment is 553 words long .
The entire debate on the amendment is 402 words long .
On Friday , when the debate on the Bill was resumed , there were huge issues to be debated , including , for example , a very important amendment from Fine Gael ’s Charles Flanagan to ensure that no one would be convicted merely on the opinion of a garda without corroborating evidence .
The debate began at noon .
At 1.30 , with some deputies pleading to be allowed to speak and a raft of amendments not yet discussed , the Ceann Comhairle simply proposed “ That the amendments set down by the Minister for Justice , Equality and Law Reform for committee stage and not disposed of are hereby made to the Bill , in respect of each of the sections undisposed of , the section , or as appropriate , the section as amended , is hereby agreed in committee . . . that the Bill , as amended , is accordingly reported to the House , that fourth stage is hereby completed and the Bill is hereby passed ” .
This was just one of a number of similar “ debates ” , including one on an important and thoughtful Labour Party Bill on support for victims of child abuse .
While Opposition
TDs did their best to get debates going , the Government just ploughed on , confident that Fianna Fáil and Green TDs would simply vote Yes or No as instructed , making Pavlov ’s dogs look like lions .
Leaving aside all questions of ideology , how can intelligent adults agree to be treated with such flagrant contempt ?
They showed that they have absolutely no respect for themselves .
That being so , who are we to disagree ?

A private security force whose biggest role is helping the U.S. government to “ combat terrorism ” is now patrolling the streets of a town in Montana , acting as law enforcement but accountable to nobody and operating completely outside the limitations of the U.S. constitution in a chilling throwback to the brownshirts of Nazi Germany .
The American Police Force organization is a paramilitary unit that “ provides surveillance , investigative , and military services across the world , ” according to its website , which shows men dressed in military fatigues carrying machine guns .
“ As part of our mission , APF plays a critical role in helping the U.S. government meet vital homeland security and national defense needs .
Within the last 5 years the United States has been far and away our # 1 client .
Technologies , programs , and services performed by APF have played a very important role in U.S. military and civilian efforts to protect our homeland and combat terrorism , ” the website states .
APF were originally contracted to provide security at a previously empty detention center in Hardin , a small town in Montana , but are now patrolling the streets driving SUV ’s with “ Police Department ” printed on them despite the fact that Hardin does n’t have a police department .
American Police Force has no jurisdiction in the area because it is a private organization , not a police force .
[ efoods ]
According to Two Rivers Authority officials , having the private security force patrol the streets was not part of the contract .
“ I have no idea .
I really do n’t because that ’s not been a part of any of the discussions we ’ve had with any of them , ” Two Rivers Authority ’s Al Peterson told KULR 8 News .
Peterson said that patrolling the streets was on the “ wishlist ” of APF ’s Captain Michael .
The American Police Force is a shady outfit shrouded in suspicion .
According to an Associated Press report , questions over the legitimacy of the organization abound .
“ Government contract databases show no record of the company .
Security industry representatives and federal officials said they had never heard of it .
On its Web site , the company lists as its headquarters a building in Washington near the White House that holds “ virtual offices . ”
A spokeswoman for the building said American Police Force never completed its application to use the address , ” reports AP .
Furthermore , APF was tasked with filling the empty Hardin detention center with inmates , without any clear indication of where those prisoners would come from .
“ It ’s unclear where the company will get the inmates for the jail .
Montana says it ’s not sending inmates to the jail , and neither are federal officials in the state , ” according to the report .
Maybe the inmates will be the local population of Hardin if American Police Force is allowed to continue to pose as a law enforcement outfit in the town , which is exactly what they intend to do for at least another month .
Having a private security force whose stated mission is to help the U.S. government “ combat terrorism ” patrol the streets of small towns in America without even having the authority to do so from local authorities is obviously a frightening pretext and harks back to the private paramilitary forces that helped Adolf Hitler rise to power in Nazi Germany .
Many fear that if martial law is declared in response to a flu pandemic or other emergency , private security forces such as APF will be used by the government to oppress citizens by operating outside of the law .
This is completely unconstitutional and a flagrant threat to the liberty and security of the population of Hardin .
The County Sheriff is effectively breaking the law if he does n’t immediately kick APF out of the area and end the occupation of the town by a private paramilitary army .

Safety of pandemic vaccines
Pandemic ( H1N1 ) 2009 briefing note 6
6 August 2009 | GENEVA - WHO is aware of some media reports that have expressed concern about the safety of vaccines for pandemic influenza .
The public needs to be reassured that regulatory procedures in place for the licensing of pandemic vaccines , including procedures for expediting regulatory approval , are rigorous and do not compromise safety or quality controls .
Vaccines are among the most important medical interventions for reducing illness and deaths during a pandemic .
However , to have the greatest impact , pandemic vaccines need to be available quickly and in large quantities .
During the 1957 and 1968 pandemics , vaccines arrived too late to be used as an effective mitigation tool during the more severe phases of the pandemics .
Influenza vaccines had not yet been developed when the 1918 pandemic swept around the world , eventually killing an estimated 50 million people .
In 2007 , as part of preparedness for an influenza pandemic , WHO worked together with health officials , regulatory authorities , and vaccine manufacturers to explore a broad range of issues surrounding the regulatory approval of pandemic vaccines . [ 1 ]
Ways were sought to shorten the time between the emergence of a pandemic virus and the availability of safe and effective vaccines .
Different regulatory pathways were assessed , and precautions needed to ensure quality , safety , and effectiveness were set out in detail .
Fast - track procedures for approval
Regulatory authorities have shown great flexibility in developing procedures for fast - tracking the approval and licensing of pandemic vaccines .
In some cases , pandemic vaccines are not regarded by regulatory authorities as entirely “ new ” vaccines , as they build on the technology used to produce vaccines for seasonal influenza , established procedures for testing and regulatory control , and an extensive body of safety data .
In such cases , approval procedures are similar to those applied to “ strain changes ” made each year when seasonal vaccines are modified to match circulating viruses in the Northern and Southern Hemispheres .
Specific regulatory procedures have been devised to expedite the approval of pandemic vaccines .
In the USA , for example , fewer data are required when the manufacturer already has a licensed influenza vaccine and intends to use the same manufacturing process for its pandemic vaccine .
In the European Union , the European Medicines Agency uses a rolling review procedure whereby manufacturers can submit sets of data for regulatory review as they become available , without having to wait until all data can be submitted together in a single formal application .
Also in Europe , some manufacturers have conducted advance studies using a so - called “ mock - up ” vaccine .
Mock - up vaccines contain an active ingredient for an influenza virus that has not circulated recently in human populations and thus mimics the novelty of a pandemic virus .
Such advance studies can greatly expedite regulatory approval .
Special safety concerns
Influenza vaccines have been used for more than 60 years and have an established record of safety in all age groups .
While some serious adverse events have been reported , these have been rare .
Nonetheless , special safety issues will inevitably arise during a pandemic when vaccine is administered on a massive scale .
For example , adverse events too rare to show up even in a large clinical trial may become apparent when very large numbers of people receive a pandemic vaccine .
Some adverse events will be coincidental – that is , associated in time with vaccine administration , yet not directly caused by the vaccine .
Genuine adverse events directly caused by the vaccine may also occur , but can not be predicted in advance .
Given the safety record of seasonal vaccines , such events are expected to be rare .
Time constraints mean that clinical data at the time when pandemic vaccines are first administered will inevitably be limited .
Further testing of safety and effectiveness will need to take place after administration of the vaccine has begun .
For these reasons , WHO advises all countries administering pandemic vaccines to conduct intensive monitoring for safety and efficacy , and many countries have plans in place for doing so .
On the positive side , mass vaccination campaigns can generate significant safety data within a few weeks .
International sharing of data from such post - marketing surveillance will be vital in guiding risk - benefit assessments and determining whether changes in vaccination policies are needed .
WHO has developed standardized protocols for data collection and reporting in real - time , and will communicate findings to the international community via its web site .

Greenwald notices the craven nepotism everywhere in Washington :
They should convene a panel for the next Meet the Press with Jenna Bush Hager , Luke Russert , Liz Cheney , Megan McCain and Jonah Goldberg , and they should have Chris Wallace moderate it .
They can all bash affirmative action and talk about how vitally important it is that the U.S. remain a Great Meritocracy because it 's really unfair for anything other than merit to determine position and employment .
They can interview Lisa Murkowski , Evan Bayh , Jeb Bush , Bob Casey , Mark Pryor , Jay Rockefeller , Dan Lipinksi , and Harold Ford , Jr. about personal responsibility and the virtues of self - sufficiency .
Bill Kristol , Tucker Carlson and John Podhoretz can provide moving commentary on how America is so special because all that matters is merit , not who you know or where you come from .
Late empires are known for several things : a self - obsessed , self - serving governing class , small over - reaching wars that bankrupt the Treasury , debt that balloons until retreat from global power becomes not a choice but a necessity , and a polity unable to address reasonably any of these questions - or how the increasing corruption of the media enables them all .
Obama is , in some ways , a test - case .
He was elected on a clear platform of reform and change ; and yet the only real achievement Washington has allowed him so far is a massive stimulus package to prevent a Second Great Depression ( and even on that emergency measure , no Republicans would support him ) .
On that he succeeded .
But that was n't reform ; it was a crash landing after one of the worst administrations in America 's history .
First things first .
Yesterday was the eight anniversary of September 11th , 2001 .
I want to extend my deepest sympathies to those who lost loved ones on that awful day .
A lot has happened in the markets in the last eight years , but one thing remains constant , greed and fear .
In my last post looking at whether the recovery will mirror the decline , I concluded that all the liquidity in the system will ensure another bubble and we all know that asset bubbles do not end well .
But what are the bubbles in the making ?
Lawrence Delevingne reporting for the Business Insider blog recently wrote on Ten Bubbles in the Making
One year after America 's brush with economic catastrophe , there 's plenty of looking back at the bubbles that caused financial chaos .
But what 's next ?
There are surely dangerous economic bubbles forming as we speak .
As Alan Greenspan warned this week , " They [ financial crises ] are all different , but they have one fundamental source , " he said .
" That is the unquenchable capability of human beings when confronted with long periods of prosperity to presume that it will continue . "
The trick , of course , is spotting them .
By definition , most people do n't spot a bubble before they form and burst .
Here 's 10 for which you should be on alert : 1 . China bubble : Despite the weak global economy , the Chinese stock market has soared like crazy this year .
But many believe the rally has been driven purely by government - supplied liquidity , rather than fundamentals .
The fear is that companies are flush with cash , but have little " real " to do with the cash , so they 're parking it in the stock market casino .
The Chinese real estate market appears to be on a similar trajectory .
2. Green bubble : Green has been everywhere .
With observers saying the " Age of Cleantech and Biotech " will be the next major economic revolution , and Washington pouring billions of dollars into alternative energy projects , you 'd think a bubble would have already formed .
But , as we noted this spring , it did not , at least from an investment perspective .
Still , as the economic recovery takes shape , alternative energy could see excess investment on hopes of big future returns .
There 's plenty of hype left , and if investors regain the cash to get in the game , could green become the next internet or housing bubble ?
3 . Gold bubble : Gold prices just keep going up .
They 've risen for seven straight years , recently breaking $ 1,000 per ounce .
Is it a bubble ?
Right now , it does n't look too bad .
Gold is good in both inflationary and deflationary periods , as it holds wealth tangibly .
And , as the Telegraph notes , there 's real demand , especially from China .
But with some predicting a doubling of prices to $ 2,000 an ounce , too many people could jump in and spike the real value of the precious metal .
The " rise forever " mentality usually means trouble .
4 . Federal Reserve bubble :
Is the Fed saving the financial system or creating another dangerous credit bubble by snapping up mortgage - backed securities ?
At first glance , the Fed 's effort to clean up mortgage - backed securities is a winner .
But , as Heidi Moore wrote for Slate 's The Big Money , the Fed is actually creating a bubble similar to the one it 's trying to do damage control on .
By eagerly trying to save banks and stabilize the housing market , Washington is taking on too much : $ 1.25 trillion of mortgaged - backed securities , including both the original toxic assets and products of foreclosures to come .
So who would bail the Fed out ?
You .
5 . Trash stock bubble :
There 's a rush to trash going on .
Stocks like Fannie Mae ( FNM ) , Freddie Mac ( FRE ) , AIG ( AIG ) and even GM made big runs in August -- trading in trash financials made up nearly one - third of NYSE 's August volume .
So why are people buying junk ?
Charlie Gasparino says shares of junk financials -- companies like Fannie , Freddie , AIG , Citi and Bank of America -- are being pushed up by a short squeeze .
The Wall Street Journal suspects its high frequency traders .
And others say its retail speculation and day traders getting their way while Wall Street went on vacation .
6 . Education bubble :
More people are going back to college and taking on huge debt to do it , despite questions about what the degree is really worth .
Last year , the amount borrowed by students and received by schools grew some 25 % over the previous year , to $ 75.1 billion .
That 's a huge amount , especially with weak , low - paying job prospects for graduates in this economy .
As we 've noted , all this student loan debt is crazy .
Despite the desire to see more subsidization of college , we suspect there will be a collapse in student loan debt availability and desire to take on new debt .
Short of telling kids not to go to college , something 's going to give .
The pop may be starting already .
As Bloomberg reports , as many as one - third of all private colleges surveyed said they expected enrollment to drop in the next academic year .
And almost 40 percent of those colleges said some of their students dropped out due to personal economic reasons and a quarter said full - time attendees switched to part time .
Half said families had to cut back their expected contributions as the value of college savings plans dropped 21 percent last year .
7 . Subprime bubble , 2.0 : What are banks doing with all those subprime mortgages ?
They 're repackaging with a higher rating -- " re-securitization of real estate mortgage investment conduits " -- and selling them .
As we 've noted , it 's a plan nearly identical to the complicated investment packages of the financial crisis a year ago .
That being said , the problem was not strictly securitization , but the underlying housing bubble .
So the return of complicated products is n't necessarily the end of the world .
8 . Life insurance securitization bubble :
In its search for new profits , Wall Street is planning on securitizing “ life settlements " -- policies that the sick and elderly can sell for cash while they 're alive -- much like it did subprime mortgages .
The New York Times warns that we could be looking at subprime all over again .
Maybe .
As we 've noted , it was n't securitization that caused the financial meltdown .
It was the bursting of the housing bubble .
Yes , there was a feedback loop , whereby securitization allowed more money to flow towards housing , but it seems unlikely that " life settlements " would get big enough to infect all portions of the financial world .
9 . Commercial real estate bubble :
This bubble is already hissing , if not popping outright .
While the economy is improving and some home sales are slowly coming back , the commercial real estate market could get far worse .
As The New York Times reports , " Even though industry lobbyists were able to persuade Congress to extend a loan program aimed at prodding the stalled securitization market back to life , several analysts said it was unlikely to head off a spate of defaults , foreclosures and bankruptcies that could surpass the devastating real estate crash of the early 1990s . "
As UPI notes , commercial mortgage defaults could reach 4.1 percent by the end of the year , up from 2.25 percent in the first quarter , and Real Capital Analytics estimates commercial property loans worth $ 83 billion have been involved in default , foreclosure or bankruptcy in 2009 .
Badly hit will likely be malls .
" The next financial tsunami to hit will be the widespread failure of shopping center mortgages , " says Peter Monroe , co-chair of REOMAC , a not for profit trade association to CNBC .
" Half a trillion dollars of commercial loans financed on historically low rates , are due for refinancing in the next three years , " says Monroe .
" The negative impact of these shopping center mortgages is enormous . "
10 .
Emerging market bubble :
It 's not just China .
Risk - tolerant investors are bidding up emerging market shares to valuations not seen in 9 years .
With an average PE of 20x , they 're not in bubble territory just yet , but watch for things to get out of hand .
Click here to view the 10 bubbles in the make slide show .
Some comments on these potential bubbles .
Earlier this week I had my quarterly lunch with three astute investors .
One of them remarked that he thinks gold might be the next bubble and now that Barrick Gold removed its hedges , he thinks it makes sense to buy a gold ETF like the SPDR Gold Shares ( GLD ) .
As for other bubbles , some concern me more than others .
The commercial real estate fiasco is driven by huge inflows of pension funds and wealth funds recklessly bidding up prices with no regard of the underlying value .
Now after several years of nonsense , commercial real estate risks sinking pensions .
Private equity is also at a breaking point and infrastructure is destined to be the next major asset bubble that pops .
Josh Rosner , managing director of Graham Fisher , was on Tech Ticker recently saying that we 're not out of the woods yet :
Everybody , it seems , knows the banks face future losses from commercial real estate , still - rising foreclosure rates , and credit card delinquencies , among other loan types .
Investors are currently ignoring the “ massive losses ” ahead for the industry and instead are focusing on the various and sundry ways the government is helping banks recapitalize on the cheap , says Josh Rosner , managing director of Graham Fisher .
But Rosner , who turned bullish on the sector last spring after making some very prescient warnings in 2007 , says the bank rally is likely to end by late October , when investors start discounting what ’s ahead .
“ We ’re not out of the woods yet , ” he says .
Furthermore , Rosner says there are other risks to the industry that are n’t being priced in currently , most notably the FDIC ’s ability ( and need ) to raise fees further as its insurance fund dwindles to dangerously low levels .
The FDIC is likely to hold off until the industry becomes healthier , Rosner says .
But " when you think you 've got earnings visibility as an investor , all of a sudden you really have to say ' hold on , what are the assessments going to be for the insurance fund ' ?
It has to be significant .
At some point the industry has to pay back the FDIC . "
Teck Ticker had another excellent interview with Richard Bookstaber discussing whether regulators can save us from ourselves ?:
Risk .
More than profit and loss , it 's the guiding principal of capitalism .
The " right " amount creates a healthy financial system and " too much " leads to failure , big and small .
That 's the topic of discussion in the accompanying clip .
A year after the world realized Wall Street had taken its dose of risk in excess , Richard Bookstaber , hedge fund veteran and author of A Demon of Our Own Design , says there 's " less risk in the system right now for the simple reason that everyone 's deleveraged . "
It wo n't last forever .
The incredible trading success Goldman Sachs has enjoyed this year is bound to change behavior , he warns .
As they reap the profits , " other people will feel forced to follow suit and start to take risk .
That 's not a good sign . "
It 's a problem former Citigroup chief executive Chuck Prince so famously addressed in July 2007 , when he said : " When the music stops , in terms of liquidity , things will be complicated .
But as long as the music is playing , you 've got to get up and dance .
We 're still dancing . "
What 's worse , the risk to the taxpayer has never been greater because former investment banks Goldman and Morgan Stanley are now bank holding companies backed by the FDIC .
So how can we prevent the boom and bust cycles former Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan coughs up to human nature ?
Bookstaber says regulators " have to make sure the people taking the risk are left holding the bag rather than the taxpayer . "
" It 's really up to the regulator , in a sense , to save us from ourselves , " he says .
One thing he said is that Goldman Sachs is now taking risks that paid off , but if everybody feels pressured to emulate them , then they will be building new systemic risk all over again .
That is one fundamental flaw of the whole financial system that has yet to be addressed .
Speaking of systemic risk , over in Europe , there are growing calls to regulate the hedge fund industry .
Bloomberg reports that that Poul Nyrup Rasmussen , the Socialist Party president who led a two - year campaign to introduce the first European Union regulation of the hedge fund industry , said he will next press firms to reduce their fees .
In an interview with the Guardian on Friday , Spain 's Economy Minister , Elena Salgado , has backed European Union plans for tougher regulations on hedge funds stating that hedge funds are not for hedging :
At stake is London 's position as the hub for 80 % of Europe 's $ 400 bn ( £ 240 bn ) hedge fund industry .
If the EU 's proposed directive is passed in its current form , hedge fund managers say they may leave their Mayfair offices and flee to Switzerland , where the regulations are less onerous .
London 's mayor , Boris Johnson , has led a campaign to protect the industry , successfully courting the Swedish , who currently hold the European presidency , and gaining their support for redrafting the directive .
But in January , when Spain takes over the presidency , hedge funds will be up against Salgado .
" They need to be regulated , and our regulation [ in Spain ] on alternative investment funds is strict and has been for a long time .
Not only hedge funds , but other funds as well , like property funds , " she said in an interview following the G20 meeting of finance ministers last weekend in London .
" The directive introduces some bigger obligations , in transparency and the protection of consumers , that we think are adequate . "
Spain is backing France and Germany , which have pushed towards tougher regulation of hedge funds , blaming them for exacerbating the credit crunch by betting on a plunge in banking shares .
Salgado , and Spain 's ruling Socialist party , also back Angela Merkel and Nicolas Sarkozy 's criticism of so - called Anglo - Saxon capitalism , advocating a more socially sensitive model .
World leaders will again discuss the role of financial institutions and the way their pay their staff at the next G20 summit in Pittsburgh on 24 - 25 September .
" We have to think about the social costs of our decisions , " Salgado says .
The debate about bank bonuses has not come to the fore in Spain because its financial system is smaller and there is less transparency about bankers ' pay .
In an interview with Il Sole 24 Ore on Thursday , former Federal Reserve Chairman Paul Volcker said banks should not be allowed to own hedge funds or equity funds and their trading activity should be limited :
" A bank that generates the major part of its income from trading should not be allowed to have a banking license , " Volcker , an economic adviser to the Obama administration , said .
Asked about introducing caps for bankers ' pay , Volcker said bankers would find a way around that .
" We 're seeing it already ; it 's obscene what they 're earning , " he said .
One year after the Lehman Brothers collapse , Volcker said he feared Wall Street would return to its old ways and " we will miss the train for reform " .
He said he did not think inflation was an immediate threat given the high unemployment and weak global economic growth .
Asked about the high U.S. deficit , Volcker said it was not a problem for the time being .
To tackle the crisis the Federal Reserve had injected an enormous amount of liquidity into the system , he said .
" For now we can absorb this but it could be a problem when the economy starts to grow again " .
Volcker said the rating agencies had contributed to the breakdown of the financial system .
" A possible solution might be to de-monopolise the sector .
Maybe there should be many more of them ...
And they could be paid by investors , " he said .
*** UPDATE : Comment from a reader ***
Perhaps the next “ bubble ” is not a sector or a financial instrument per se .
Perhaps it is Canada , the country , its currency and the commodity story which underpins its apparent / perceived world class government , banks and healthcare institutions … safe haven with upside leveraged to the global recovery , and without the war machine or media culture of the US .
Let the money pour in ( and the essence of a bubble is that none of the foregoing strengths of Canada may actually be true , nor durable ) …
The banking / hedge fund / private equity / commercial real estate bubble is the Mother of All bubbles , but this is endemic to a culture that promotes excessive risk taking and rewards it with excessive compensation .
Finally , a word of caution of the " green energy bubble " .
Last week Naked Capitalism posted an entry stating that Solar Crisis Set to Hit in 2010 .
Again , avoid listening to this doom & gloom .
The sun is not setting on solar stocks and top hedge funds are scooping them up at these levels .
Moreover , the solar credit crunch will ease in 2010
And then there is the biotech and health care bubble .
Biotech is extremely interesting but very risky .
In health care , I like medical device shares and monitor a list of stocks that hedge funds are buying .
You can also invest in the iShares Dow Jones US Medical DevicesSo place your bets on the next bubble , being fully cognizant that some bubbles are better than others .
In particular , some bubbles might allocate much needed resources to renewable energy and health care while others risk the demise of the entire global financial system .

Today , although fully submerged by an anomalous wave of errands which had been patiently waiting for my return at work , I heroically managed to dig out of the ArXiv a paper worth a close look .
The study , titled " Likelihood Functions for Supersymmetric Observables in Frequentist Analyses of the CMSSM and NUHM1 " and authored by renowned supersymmetry experts like John Ellis and Sven Heinemeyer , and experimentalists like my CMS colleagues Albert De Roeck and Henning Flacher , had me thinking that Supersymmetry does have an answer for everything , apparently .
That , at least , is what one gets from even a careless look at a few of the figures in the paper .
But let me get back a few steps and explain what I am talking about , before I am left alone here .
Supersymmetry is an appealing extension of the Standard Model of particle physics , which is both beautiful and naughty .
In order to fix a problem of the Standard Model - the unbearable lightness of the Higgs boson - Supersymmetry tries to sell us the existence of dozen new particles yet unseen , fourscore new parameters and then a few , and one additional symmetry principle : for every fermion there is a boson , and for every boson there is a fermion .
A beautiful , but broken , new symmetry of mother Nature ( another well - known bitch ) .
Broken , because the supersymmetric bodies are all much heavier than their standard counterparts : lest we would have already seen them !
To tell the truth , Susy ( that is the nickname by which she goes among those who have entertained themselves with her at least once ) is not just easy at claiming new bodies : it also openly displays a pair of additional nice features that make her appealing .
On one side , it provides precise high - energy convergence to a common value for the coupling strength of the fundamental interactions .
And on the other , it contains a perfect candidate for the unaccounted mass of the Universe among the score of new particles it hypothesizes : the neutralino .
Make no mistake : Susy is unification - ready , and just what you need for a big Bang .
The neutralino is the lightest supersymmetric particle .
It can not decay to anything lighter , and so is bound to live forever .
It is electrically neutral , so light cannot see it ; it is not made of coloured stuff , so ordinary matter hardly stops it ; and it is just expected to have the right mass to make the matter balance of our Universe compatible with its evolution after the big bang .
After the above introduction , it is time to get serious again and discuss the paper .
I do not wish to summarize it for you here - it is 34 pages long , and I would be unable to do it in a reasonable amount of time ; plus , there is no real reason to do it since the paper is quite readable and you should definitely donwload it from here .
All I can do here is to just concentrate on a few of its many interesting results .
To verify the compatibility of Susy with the present experimental status of particle physics and astrophysics , the study considers all electroweak precision data ( measurements at the Z peak by LEP and SLC , Tevatron results on the top and W boson masses , neutrino scattering experiments , and then a few ) , together with the precise measurement of the muon gyromagnetic ratio ( a quantity which has a highly predictive power for new physics , since its value would be sizably affected by the existence of new particles circulating inside virtual loops in the scattering diagrams affecting the muon anomaly ) , B physics observables ( which for the same reason have something to say about the existence of those fancy massive new particles ) , and cosmological constraints .
In this sense , it is a really complete account of the inputs we may have at hand to determine whether Susy is just a dream or the girl next door .
Because supersymmetry is not a single theory , but rather a framework of different theories which may display the widest variety of phenomenology depending on the value of a few critical parameters , the study only considers a subset of specific models , ones going by the name of CMSSM and NUHM1 .
these are particular varieties of the minimal supersymmetric extension of the Standard Model ( MSSM ) , and to explain their details I would need to write more than I am willing to about them here .
Suffices to say here that these theories are enough well - defined that they can make definite predictions for some quantities we have a chance of measuring before our retirement .
The authors offer us the results of a fit to all the measured quantities considered in the study , which has the benefit of taking a frequentist approach for the statistical analysis : this frees them from the need of assuming any knowledge of the a priori distribution of some of the parameters , and makes the results insensitive to such assumptions .
The fit is a quite smart one , which investigates with care the full parameter space ; all model parameters are varied simultaneously in the sampling of the multidimensional space .
The paper explains several technical details that I cannot report here ; these give the impression that the work has been done with care , and one has the feeling that the results and their uncertainties may be trusted to be a faithful representation of the current status of our indirect knowledge on Supersymmetry from the available experimental inputs .
An interesting result of the fit is the branching fraction of the Bs meson ( a particle made by a strange quark and a anti-bottom one ) to muon pairs : within the best solution of the CMSSM this quantity is close to the Standard Model prediction - which is bad , since experimentally we have quite a lot of work ahead before we can measure it if it is so small ; on the other hand , it may easily be much larger for the NUHM1 , which exposes that theory to a direct proof ( or bust ) ina not - so - distant future .
In the figure below you see the likelihood functions as a function of Bs branching fraction ; the black line shows the Standard Model prediction .
You can see that in the NUHM1 model ( right ) the likelihood has a much flatter minimum extending to several tens in 10 ^ - 8 .
Maybe the most striking result of the study is the observation thatwithin the NUHM1 a value of the lightest neutral Higgs boson : in other words , while the Standard Model ( and quite a few points of the SUSY parameter space ) is hard - pressed to explain why the Higgs boson is heavier than 114.4 GeV , when electroweak data would instead point to smaller values ( the latest fits in the LEP electroweak working group page point to , so about one standard deviation below the strict bound set at LEP ) , the NUHM1 actually favors a Higgs mass above that bound .
As far as the lightest Higgs boson is concerned , within the CMSSM the best fit produces an estimate of , with a fit probability of 36 % .
This value is smaller than the 95 % CL bound set by LEP II , but close enough to it that it is still reasonably possible .
For the NUHM1 , the minimum occurs for , with a similar probability of the CMSSM fit .
You can see the results in the figure below , which shows the likelihood functions and their minima as a function of the Higgs mass for the CMSSM ( left ) and NUHM1 model ( right ) .
The curves which are most interesting to me are the dashed ones : they exclude from the fit the knowledge of the lower bound on MH set by the LEP II experiments , and thus show that the NUHM1 model does prefer a mass above the crucial 114.4 GeV divide .
Also worth mentioning here is that for the mass of the lightest neutralino , the best fit value turns out to have a sharp minimum at about 120 GeV in both considered models : this is not a surprise , but it is again interesting from an experimental standpoint , since such mass values may be accessible in the near future .
The paper contains several plots like the ones shown above , describing the likely values of many of the important parameters of the theories considered .
If you are at all interested in knowing what is the most likely mass value of your favorite - ino particle , your curiosity will be satiated .
As for me , I find it remarkable that Supersymmetry ( or at least a few points of its hundred - dimensional parameter space ) keeps standing head and shoulder above the surge of experimental results coming out of the Tevatron , which stubbornly insists finding everything in agreement with the Standard Model and no trace of sparticles around .
In principle , in three months time the start - up of LHC might allow us to discover Supersymmetry in the matter of a few weeks , or even days of running .
Well , make it a few months .
Reality , I am told , is usually different .
Life is tough , Nature is a bitch , and Susy is presently hiding in the dark .
Stay tuned .

CRC and how to Reverse it
A CRC Tutorial & The c00l way to Reverse CRC
Written by anarchriz
Introduction
This essay consists of a CRC tutorial and a way of how to reverse it .
Many Coders / Fravias do n't know exactly how CRC works and almost no one knows how to reverse it , while this knowledge could be very usefull .
First the tutorial will learn you how to calculate CRC in general , you can use it as data / code protection .
Second , the reverse part will learn you ( mainly ) how to reverse CRC - 32 , you can use this to break certain CRC protections in programs or over programs ( like anti-virus ) .
There seem to be utilities who can ' correct ' CRCs for you , but I doubt they also explain what they 're doing .
I 'd like to warn you , since there is quite some math used in this essay .
This wont harm anyone , and will be well understood by the avarage Fravia or Coder .
Why ?
Well .
If you dont know why math is used in CRC , I suggest that you click that button with a X at the top - right of this screen .
So I assume the reader has knowledge of binair arithmetic .
Essay
Part 1 : CRC Tutorial , what it is and how to calculate it Cyclic Redundancy Code or CRC
We all know CRC .
Even if you do n't recall , you will when you think of those annoying messages RAR , ZIP and other compressors give you when the file is corrupted due to bad connections or those !@ # $ % floppies .
The CRC is a value computed over a piece of data , for example for each file at the time of compression .
When the archiver is unpacking that file , it will read the CRC and check it with the newly computed CRC of the uncompressed file .
When they match , there is a good chance that the files are identical .
With CRC - 32 , there is a chance of 1/2^32 of the check failing to recognize a change in data .
A lot of people think CRC is short for Cyclic Redundancy Check .
If indeed CRC is short for Cyclic Redundancy Check then a lot of people use the term incorrect .
If it was you could not say ' the CRC of the program is 12345678 ' .
People are also always saying a certain program has a CRC check , not a Cyclic Redundancy Check check .
Conclusion : CRC stands for Cyclic Redundancy Code and NOT for Cyclic Redundancy Check .
How is the calculation done ?
Well , the main idea is to see the file as one large string of bits divided by some number , which will leave you with a remainder , the CRC !
You always have a remainder ( can also be zero ) which is at most one bit less then the divisor ( else it still has a divisor in it ) .
( 9/3=3 remainder=0 ; ( 9+2)/3=3 remainder=2 )
Only here dividing with bits is done a little different .
Dividing is repeatedly substracting ( x times ) a number ( divisor ) from a number you want to divide , which will leave you with the remainder .
If you want the original number back you multiply with the divisor or ( idem ) add x times the divisor with itself and afterwards adding the remainder .
CRC computation uses a special way of substracting and adding , i.e. a new ' arithmetic ' .
While computing the carry for each bit calculation is ' forgotten ' .
Lets look at 2 examples , number 1 is a normal substraction , 2&3 are special .
-+ ( 1 ) 1101 ( 2 ) 1010 1010 ( 3 ) 0+0=0 0-0=0 1010 - 1111 + 1111 - 0+1=1 *0-1=1 ---- ---- ---- 1+0=1 1-0=1 0011 0101 0101 * 1+1=0 1-1=0
In ( 1 ) , the second column from the right would evaluate to 0 - 1 = - 1 , therefore a bit is ' borrowed ' from the bit next to it , which will give you this substraction ( 10+0 ) - 1=1 .
( this is like normal ' by - paper ' decimal substraction )
The special case ( 2&3 ) 1+1 would normally have as answer 10 , where the ' 1 ' is the carry which ' transports ' the value to the next bit computation .
This value is forgotten .
The special case 0 - 1 would normally have as answer ' - 1 ' , which would have impact on the bit next to it ( see example 1 ) .
This value is also forgotten .
If you know something about programming this looks like , or better , it IS the XOR operation .
Now look at an example of a divide :
In normal arithmetic : 1001/1111000\1101 13 9/120\13 1001 - 09 -| ---- -- | 1100 30 | 1001 - 27 - ---- -- 0110 3 -> the remainder 0000 - ---- 1100 1001 - ---- 011 -> 3 , the remainder In CRC arithmetic : 1001/1111000\1110 9/120\14 remainder 6 1001 - ---- 1100 1001 - ---- 1010 1001 - ---- 0110 0000 - ---- 110 -> the remainder ( example 3 ) The quotient of a division is not important , and not efficient to remember , because that would be only a couple of bits less than the bitstring where you wanted to calculate the CRC from .
What IS important is the remainder !
That 's the thing that says something important over about the original file .
That 's basicly the CRC !
Going over to the real CRC computation
To perform a CRC calculation we need to choose a divisor , we call it the ' poly ' from now on .
The width W of a poly is the position of the highest bit , so the width of poly 1001 is 3 , and not 4 .
Note that the highest bit is always one , when you have chosen the width of the poly you only have to choose a value for the lower W bits .
If we want to calculate the CRC over a bitstring , we want to make sure all the bits are processed .
Therefore we need to add W zero bits to the end of the bitstring .
In the case of example 3 , we could say the bitstring was 1111 .
Look at a little bigger example : Poly = 10011 , width W=4 Bitstring +
W zeros = 110101101 + 0000 10011/1101011010000\110000101
( we do n't care about the quotient ) 10011

11100 10011 - ----- 1111 -> the remainder -> the CRC ! ( example 4 ) There are 2 important things to state here : 1 . Only when the highest bit is one in the bitstring we XOR it with the poly , otherwise we only ' shift ' the bitstring one bit to the left .
2 . The effect of XORring is , that it 's XORed with the lower W bits , because the highest bit always gives zero .
Going over to a Table - Driven Algorithm
You all should understand that an algorithm based on bitwise calculation will be very slow and inefficient .
It would be far more efficient if you could calculate it on a per - byte basis .
But then we can only accept poly 's with a width of a multiple of 8 bits ( that 's a byte ; ) .
Lets visualize it in a example poly with a width of 32 ( W=32 ) : 3 2 1 0 byte +---+---+---+---+
Pop ! this is the poly , 4 * 8 bits ( figure 1 ) This is a register you use to store the temporary result of the CRC , I call it the CRC register or just register from now on .
You are shifting bits from the bitstring in at the right side , and bits out at the left side .
When the bit just shifted out at the left side is one , the whole register is XORred by the lower W bits of the poly ( in this case 32 ) .
In fact , we are doing exactly the same thing as the divisions above .
What if ( as I said ) we would shift in & out a whole group of bits at once .
Look at an example of 8 bit CRC with 4 bits at once shifted in & out :
The register just before the shift : 10110100
Then 4 bits ( at the top ) are shifted out at the left side while shifting 4 new bits in at the right side .
In this example 1011 is shifted out and 1101 ( new ) is shifted in .
Then the situation is this : 8 bits currently CRC / Register : 01001101 4 top bits just shifted out : 1011 We use this poly : 101011100 , width W=8 Now we calculate just as usual the new value of the register .
Top Register ---- --------
1011 01001101 the topbits and the register 1010 11100 + ( *1 ) Poly is XORred on position 3 of top bits ( coz there is a one ) -------------
0001 10101101 result of XORring
Now we still have a one on bit position 0 of topbits : 0001 10101101 previous result 1 01011100 + ( *2 ) Poly is XORred on position 0 of top bits ( coz there is a one ) -------------
0000 11110001 result of second XORring ^^^^
Now there are all zero's in the topbits , so we dont have to XOR with the poly anymore for this sequence of topbits .
The same value in the register you get if you first XOR ( * 1 ) with ( * 2 ) and the result with the register .
This is because of the standard XOR property : ( a XOR b ) XOR c = a XOR ( b XOR c ) 1010 11100 poly on position 3 of top bits 1 01011100 + poly XORred on position 0 of top bits ------------- 1011 10111100 ( * 3 ) result of XORring
The result ( * 3 ) is XORred with the register 1011 10111100 1011 01001101 + the top bits and the register ------------- 0000 11110001
You see ?
The same result !
Now ( * 3 ) is important , because with the top bits 1010 is always the value ( * 3 ) =10111100 ( only the lower W=8 bits ) bound ( under the stated conditions , of course )
This means you can precompute the XOR values for each combination of top bits .
Note that top bits always become zero after one iteration , this must be because the combination of XORring leads to it .
Now we come back to figure 1 .
For each value of the top byte ( 8 bits ) just shifted out , we can precompute a value .
In this case it would be a table consisting of 256 ( 2^8 ) entries of double words ( 32 bit ) .
( the CRC - 32 table is in the appendix ) In pseudo - language our algoritm now is this :
While ( byte string is not exhausted ) Begin Top = top_byte of register ; Register = Register shifted 8 bits left ORred with a new byte from string ; Register = Register XORred by value from precomputedTable at position Top ; End The direct Table Algorithm
The algorithm proposed above can be optimized .
The bytes from the byte string do n't need to travel through the whole register before they are used .
With this new algorithm we can directly XOR a byte from a byte string with the byte shifted out of the register .
The result points to a value in the precomputed table which will be XORred with the register .
I do n't know exactly why this gives the same result ( it has to do with a XOR property ) , but it has the Big advantage you do n't have to append zero bytes / bits to your byte string .
( if you know why , pleaz tell me :)
Lets visuallize this algorithm : +----< byte string ( or file ) | v 3 2 1 0 byte | +---+---+---+---+
XOR----: : : : : +---+---+---+---+ | | | | | +---+---+---+---+ ( figure 2 ) The ' reflected ' direct Table Algorithm
To make things more complicated there is a ' reflected ' version of this algorithm .
A Reflected value / register is that it 's bits are swapped around it 's centre .
For example 0111011001 is the reflection of 1001101110 .
They came up with this because of the UART ( chip that performs serial IO ) , which sends each byte with the least significant bit ( bit 0 ) first and the most significant bit ( bit 7 ) last , this is the reverse of the normal situation .
Instead then of reflecting each byte before processing , every else is reflected .
An advantage is that it gives more compact code in the implementation .
So , in calculating the table , bits are shifted to the right and the poly is reflected .
In calculating the CRC the register is shifted to the right and ( of course ) the reflected table is used .
byte string ( or file ) -->---+ | 1 . In the table each entry is reflected byte 3 2 1 0 V 2 .
The initial register is reflected +---+---+---+---+ |

Some implementations in Assembly
To get everything settled here 's the complete CRC - 32 standard : Name : " CRC - 32 " Width : 32 Poly : 04C11DB7 Initial value : FFFFFFFF
Reflected :
True XOR out with : FFFFFFFF
As a bonus for you curious people , here 's the CRC - 16 standard : :)
Name : " CRC - 16 " Width : 16 Poly : 8005 Initial value : 0000 Reflected : True XOR out with : 0000 ' XOR out with ' is the value that is XORred with the final value of the register before getting ( as answer ) the final CRC .
There are also ' reversed ' CRC poly 's but they are not relevant for this tutorial .
Look at my references if you want to know more about that .
For the assembly implementation I use 32 bit code in 16 bit mode of DOS ... so you will see some mixing of 32 bit and 16 bit code ... it is easy to convert it to complete 32 bit code .
Note that the assembly part is fully tested to be working correctly , the Java or C code is derived from that .
Ok .
Here is the assembly implementation for computing the CRC - 32 table : xor ebx , ebx ; ebx=0 , because it will be used whole as pointer InitTableLoop : xor eax , eax ; eax=0 for new entry mov al , bl ; lowest 8 bits of ebx are copied into lowest 8 bits of eax ; generate entry xor cx , cx entryLoop : test eax , 1 jz no_topbit shr eax , 1 xor eax , poly jmp entrygoon no_topbit : shr eax , 1 entrygoon : inc cx test cx , 8 jz entryLoop mov dword ptr[ ebx * 4 + crctable ] , eax inc bx test bx , 256 jz InitTableLoop Notes : - crctable is an array of 256 dwords - eax is shifted to the right because the CRC - 32 uses reflected Algorithm - also therefore the lowest 8 bits are processed ...
In Java or C ( int is 32 bit ) : for ( int bx=0 ; bx < 256 ; bx++ ) { int eax=0 ; eax=eax&0xFFFFFF00+bx&0xFF
; // the ' mov al , bl ' instruction for ( int cx=0 ; cx < 8 ; cx ++ ) { if ( eax &&0x1 ) { eax >> =1 ; eax^=poly ; } else eax >> =1 ; } crctable [ bx ] =eax ; } The implementation for computing CRC - 32 using the table : computeLoop : xor ebx , ebx xor al , [ si ] mov bl , al shr eax , 8 xor eax , dword ptr [ 4 * ebx+crctable ] inc si loop computeLoop xor eax , 0FFFFFFFFh Notes : - ds : si points to the buffer where the bytes to process are - cx contains the number of bytes to process - eax contains current CRC - crctable is the table computed with the code above - the initial value of the CRC is in the case of CRC - 32 : FFFFFFFF - after complete calculation the CRC is XORred with : FFFFFFFF which is the same as NOTting .
In Java or C it is like this : for ( int cx=0 ; cx > =8 ; eax^=crcTable[ebx ] ; } eax ^=0xFFFFFFFF ;
So now we landed at the end of the first part :
The CRC tutorial If you want to make a little deeper dive in CRC I suggest reading the document I did , you will find the URL at the end of this document .
Ok .
On to the most interresting part of this document : Reversing CRC !
Part 2 : Reversing CRC
When I was thinking of a way to reverse it ... I got stuck several times .
I tried to ' deactivate ' the CRC by thinking of such an sequence of bytes that it then should n't matter anymore what bytes you would place behind it .
I could n't do it ...
Then I realized it could NEVER work that way , because CRC algorithm is build in such a way it would n't matter which _bit_ you would change , the complete CRC _always_ ( well always ... almost ) changes drasticly .
Try that yourself ( with some simple CRC programs ) ... :)
I realized I only could ' correct ' the CRC _after_ the bytes I wanted to change .
So I could make such a sequence of bytes , that would ' transform ' the CRC into whatever I wanted !
Lets visualize the idea : Bunch of bytes : 01234567890123456789012345678901234567890123456789012
You want to change from ^ this byte to ^ this one .
Thats position 9 to 26 .
We also need 4 extra bytes ( until position 30 ^ ) for the sequence of bytes which will change the CRC back to its original value after the patched bytes .
When you are calculating the CRC - 32 it goes fine until the byte on position 9 , in the patched bunch of bytes the CRC radically changes from that point on .
Even when pass position 26 , from where the bytes are not changed , you never get the original CRC back .
NOT !
When you read the rest of this essay you know how .
In short you have do this when patching a certain bunch of bytes while maintainting the CRC : 1 . Calculate the CRC until position 9 , and save this value .
2 . Continue calculating until position 27 and 4 extra bytes , save the resulting value .
3 . Use the value of 1 for calculating the CRC of the ' new ' bytes and the extra 4 bytes ( this should be 27 - 9+4=22 bytes ) and save the resulting value .
4 . Now we have the ' new ' CRC value , but we want the CRC to be the ' old ' CRC value .
We use the reverse algorithm to compute the 4 extra bytes .
We can to point 1 to 3 , below you learn to do point 4 . Reversing CRC - 16
I thought , to make it more easy for you , first to calculate the reverse of CRC - 16 .
Ok .
We are on a certain point after the patched code where you want to change the CRC back to its original .
We know the original CRC ( calculated before patching the data ) and the current CRC register .
We want to calculate the 2 - bytestring which changes the current CRC register to the original CRC .
First we calculate ' normally ' the CRC with the unknown 2 bytes naming them X and Y , for the register I take a 1 a0 , the only non-variable is zero ( 00 ) . :)
Look again at our latest CRC algorithm , figure 3 , to understand better what im doing .
Ok , here we go :
Take a 2 - bytestring ' X Y '.
Bytes are processed from the left side .
Take for register a 1 a0 .
For a XOR operation I write '+' ( as in the CRC tutorial ) Processing first byte , X : a0+X this is the calculated topbyte ( 1 ) b1 b0 sequence in table where the topbyte points at 00 a1 to right shifted register 00+b1 a1+b0 previous 2 lines XORred with eachother Now the new register is : ( b1 ) ( a1+b0 ) Processing second byte , Y : ( a1+b0 ) + Y this is the calculated topbyte ( 2 ) c1 c0 sequence in table where the topbyte points at 00 b1 to right shifted register 00+c1 b1+c0 previous 2 lines XORred with eachother Now the final register is : ( c1 ) ( b1+c0 ) I 'll show it a little different way : a0 + X = ( 1 ) points to b1 b0 in table a 1 + b0 + Y = ( 2 ) points to c1 c0 in table b1 + c0=d0 new low byte of register c1=d1 new high byte of register ( 1 ) ( 2 ) Wow !
Let this info work out on you for a while ... :)
Do n't be afraid , a real value example is coming soon .
What if you wanted the register to be some d1 d0 ( the original CRC ) and you know the value of the register before the transformation ( so a 1 a 0 ) ... what 2 bytes or what X and Y would you have to fed through the CRC calculation ?
Ok .
We will begin working from the back to the front .
d0 must be b1+c0 and d1 must be c1 ...
But how - the - hell , I hear you say , can you know the value of byte b1 and c0 ???
ShallI remember you about the Table ?
You can just lookup the value of the word C0 C1 in the Table because you know C1 .
Therefore you need to make a ' lookup ' routine .
If you found the value , be sure to remember the index to the value because that 's the way to find the unknown topbytes e.g. ( 1 ) & ( 2 ) !
So now you found c1 c0 , how to get b1 b0 ?
If b1+c0=d0 then b1=d0+c0 !
Now you use the lookup routine to lookup the b1 b0 value too .
Now we know everything to calculate X & Y !
Cool huh ?
a 1+b0+Y =( 2 ) so Y=a 1+b0 + ( 2 ) a0+X = ( 1 ) so X=a0 +
(1) Non-variable example for CRC - 16 Lets look at an example with real values : - register before : ( a1 = ) DE ( a0 = ) AD - wanted register : ( d1= ) 12 ( d0 = ) 34 Look up the entry beginning with 12 in the CRC - 16 table in the appendix .
- This is entry 38h with value 12C0 .
Try to find another entry beginning with 12 .
You can't find another because we calculated each entry for each possible value of the topbyte and that 's 256 values , remember !
Now we know ( 2 ) = 38 , c1= 12 and c0 = C0 , so b1 = C0+34=F4 , now look up the entry of B1 beginning with F4 .
- This is entry 4Fh with value F441 .
Now we know ( 1 ) = 4 F , b1= F4 and b0= 41 .
Now all needed values are known , to compute X and Y we do : Y=a1+b0 + (2) =DE+41+38=A7 X=a0 + (1 ) =AD+4 F =E2 Conclusion : to change the CRC - 16 register from DEAD to 1234 we need the bytes E2 A7 ( in that order ) .
You see , to reverse CRC you have to ' calculate ' your way back , and remember the values along the way .
When you are programming the lookup table in assembly , remember that intel saves values backwards in Little - Endian format .
Now you probably understand how to reverse CRC - 16 .... now CRC - 32 Reversing CRC - 32
Now we had CRC - 16 , CRC - 32 is just as easy ( or as difficult ) .
You now work with 4 bytes instead of 2 .
Keep looking and comparing this with the 16bit version from above .
Take a 4 - bytestring X Y Z W , bytes are taken from the LEFT side Take for register a 3 a 2 a 1 a0 Note that a3 is the most significant byte and a0 the least .
Processing first byte , X : a0+X this is the calculated topbyte ( 1 ) b3 b2 b1 b0 sequence in table where the topbyte points at 00 a 3 a 2 a 1 to right shifted register 00+b3 a3+b2 a2+b1 a1+b0 previous 2 lines XORred with eachother Now the new register is : ( b3 ) ( a3+b2 ) ( a2+b1 ) ( a1+b0 ) Processing second byte , Y : ( a1+b0 ) + Y this is the calculated topbyte ( 2 ) c 3 c2 c1 c0 sequence in table where the topbyte points at 00 b3 a3+b2 a2+b1 to right shifted register 00+c3 b3+c2 a3+b2+c1 a2+b1+c0 previous 2 lines XORred with eachother Now the new register is : ( c3 ) ( b3+ c2 ) ( a3+b2+c1 ) ( a2+b1+c0 ) Processing third byte , Z : ( a2+b1+c0 ) + Z this is the calculated topbyte ( 3 ) d3 d2 d1 d0 sequence in table where the topbyte points at 00 c3 b3+c2 a3+b2+c1 to right shifted register 00+d3 c3+d2 b3+c2+d1 a3+b2+c1+d0 previous 2 lines XORred with eachother Now the new register is : ( d3 ) ( c3+d2 ) ( b3+c2+d1 ) ( a3+b2+ c1+d0 ) Processing fourth byte , W : ( a3+b2+ c1+d0 ) +
W this is the calculated topbyte ( 4 ) e3 e2 e1 e0 sequence in table where the topbyte points at 00 d3 c3+d2 b3+c2+d1 to right shifted register 00+e3 d3+e2 c3+d2+e1 b3+c2+d1+e0 previous 2 lines XORred with eachother Now the final register is : ( e3 ) ( d3+e2 ) ( c3+d2+e1 ) ( b3+c2+d1+e0 )
I 'll show it a little different way : a0 + X = ( 1 ) points to b3 b2 b1 b0 in table a 1 + b0 + Y = ( 2 ) points to c3 c2 c1 c0 in table a 2 + b1 + c0 + Z =( 3 ) points to d3 d2 d1 d0 in table a 3 + b2 + c1 + d0 + W = ( 4 ) points to e4 e3 e2 e1 in table b3 + c2 + d1 + e0 =f0 c3 + d2 + e1 =f1 d3 + e2 =f2 e3 =f3 ( 1 ) ( 2 ) ( 3 ) ( 4 ) ( figure 4 ) This is reversed in the same way as the 16 bit version .
I shall give an example with real values .
For the table values use the CRC - 32 table in the appendix .
Take for CRC register before , a 3 a 2 a 1 a0 -> AB CD EF 66
Take for CRC register after , f3 f2 f1 f0 -> 56 33 14 78 ( wanted value )
Here we go :
First byte of entries entry value e3=f3 =56 -> 35h=(4 ) 56B3C423 for e3 e2 e1 e0 d3=f2+e2 =33+B3 =E6 -> 4Fh=(3 ) E6635C01 for d3 d2 d1 d0 c3=f1+e1+d2 =14+C4+63 = B3 -> F8h =( 2 ) B3667A2E for c3 c2 c1 c0 b3=f0+e0+d1+c2=78+23+5C+66=61 -> DEh =(1 ) 616BFFD3 for b3 b2 b1 b0 Now we have all needed values , then X = ( 1 ) + a0 = DE+66=B8 Y= ( 2 ) + b0+a1= F8 +D3+EF=C4 Z= ( 3 ) + c0+b1+a2= 4F+2E+FF+CD=53 W=( 4) +d0+c1+b2+a3=35+01+7A+6B+AB=8E
( final computation ) Conclusion : to change the CRC - 32 register from ABCDEF66 to 56331478 we need this sequence of bytes : B8 C4 53 8E The reverse Algorithm for CRC - 32
If you look at the by - hand computation of the sequence of bytes needed to change the CRC register from a 3 a 2 a 1 a0 to f3 f2 f1 f0 its difficult to transform this into a nice compact algorithm .
Look at an extended version of the final computation : Position X = ( 1 ) + a0 0 Y = ( 2 ) + b0 + a 1 1 Z = ( 3 ) + c0 + b1 + a 2 2 W = ( 4 ) + d0 + c1 + b2 + a 3 3 f0= e0 + d1 + c2 + b3 4 f1= e1 + d2 + c3 5 f2 = e2 + d3 6 f3 = e3 7 ( figure 5 ) It is just the same as figure 4 , only some values / bytes exchanged .
This view will help us to get a compact algorithm .
What if we take a buffer of 8 bytes that is , for every line you see in figure 5 one byte is reserved .
Bytes 0 to 3 are filled with a0 to a3 , bytes 4 to 7 are filled with f0 to f3 .
As before , we take the last byte e3 which is equal to f3 and lookup the complete value in the CRC table .
Then we XOR this value ( e3 e2 e1 e0 ) on position 4 ( as in figure 5 ) .
Then we automatically know what the value of d3 is , because we already XORred f3 f2 f1 f0 with e3 e2 e1 e0 , and f2+e2=d3 .
Because we now already know what the value of ( 4 ) is ( the entry number ) , we can directly XOR the value into position 3 .
Now we know d3 use this to lookup the value of d3 d2 d1 d0 and XOR this on one position earlier , that is position 3 ( look at the figure ! ) .
XOR the found entry number ( 3 ) for the value on position 2 .
We now know c3 because we have the value f1+e1+d2=c3 on position 5 .
We go on doing this until we XORred b3 b2 b1 b0 on position 1 .
Et voila !
Bytes 0 to 3 of the buffer now contains the needed bytes X to W !
Summarized is here the algorithm : 1 . Of the 8 byte buffer , fill position 0 to 3 with a0 to a3 ( the start value of the CRC register ) , and position 4 to 7 with f0 to f3 ( wanted end value of CRC register ) .
2 . Take the byte from position 7 and use it to lookup the complete value .
3 . XOR this value ( dword ) on position 4 4 . XOR the entry number ( byte ) on position 3 5 .
Repeat step 2 & 3 three more times while decreasing the positions each time by one .
Implementation of the Reverse Algorithm Now its time for some code .
Below are the implementation of the reverse algorithm for CRC - 32 in Assembly ( it is not difficult to do this for other languages and / or CRC standards ) .
Note that in assembly ( on PC's ) dwords are written to and read from memory in reverse order .
crcBefore dd (? ) wanted Crc dd (? ) buffer db 8 dup (? ) mov eax , dword ptr[crcBefore ] ;/* mov dword ptr[ buffer ] , eax mov eax , dword ptr[ wanted Crc ] ; Step 1 mov dword ptr[ buffer + 4 ] , eax ;*/ mov di , 4 computeReverseLoop : mov al , byte ptr[ buffer+di+3 ]
;/* call GetTableEntry ; Step 2 */ xor dword ptr[ buffer+di ] , eax ; Step 3 xor byte ptr[ buffer + di-1 ] , bl ; Step 4 dec di ;/* jnz computeReverseLoop ; Step 5 */ Notes : - Registers eax , di bx are used Implementation of GetTableEntry crctable dd 256 dup ( ? ) ; should be defined globally somewhere & initialized of course mov bx , offset crctable - 1 getTableEntryLoop : add bx , 4 ; points to ( crctable - 1 ) + k*4 ( k:1..256 ) cmp [ bx ] , al ; must always find the value somewhere jne getTableEntryLoop sub bx , 3 mov eax , [ bx ] sub bx , offset crctable shr bx , 2 ret On return eax contains a table entry , bx contains the entry number .
Outtro Well ... your reached the end of this essay .
If you now think : wow , all those programs which are protected by CRC can say ' bye , bye ' .
Nope .
It is very easy to make an anti-anti-CRC code .
To make a succesfull CRCreverse you have to know exactly from what part of the code the CRC is calculated and what CRC algorithm is used .
A simple countermeasure is using 2 different CRC algorithms , or combination with another dataprotection algorithm .

You are deep inside Fravia 's page of reverse engineering , choose your way out :
A spokesman for Strathclyde Police made the comment about a procession by the newly - formed Scottish Defence League ( SDL ) that is pencilled in for November .
Anti-racist campaigners believe the far - right group wants to hold its rally near a mosque in Glasgow , or at a venue that is being lined up as a Muslim place of worship in Kilmarnock .
The SDL is thought to be affiliated to the English Defence League ( EDL ) , an organisation that has staged protests this year against what it calls “ militant Islam ” .
The English group , which claims not to have any formal links with the British National Party , includes members of the BNP and a large football hooligan element .
It is the SDL ’s intention to hold a demonstration in Scotland on November 14 that is worrying local authorities , police and community activists .
Authorities believe the SDL has earmarked George Square in Glasgow or land near the city ’s sheriff court building as possible locations for the demonstration .
The latter venue is close to Glasgow Central mosque , a focal point for Strathclyde ’s 30,000 Muslims .
Another option being considered for the protest , according to websites used by EDL supporters , is the Hillhead Tavern in Kilmarnock .
Al - Huda Educational Society of Kilmarnock has hopes of buying the pub and turning it into Ayrshire ’s first mosque .
However , the Sunday Herald understands that Strathclyde Police are ready to oppose any application for a rally that stirs up racial tensions .
Inspector Brian Gibson reportedly told a public meeting in Glasgow last week that such a proposal would not be welcomed by his force .
Groups need a local council ’s permission if a rally requires the use of a ‘ public space ’ , such as George Square , or if a procession involves road closures .
It is at the point of a formal application that a police force can advise a local authority on whether an event should take place .
Osama Saeed , chief executive of the Scottish Islamic Foundation , said : “ We congratulate Glasgow City Council and Strathclyde Police for the stance that they ’ve taken on the SDL .
“ The likelihood is , though , that even if banned there will be an illegal protest .
We have to be ready for that .
“ Some sort of action against this protest is inevitable and necessary , though it is essential that it is peaceful . ”
A police spokesperson said : “ A police officer in attendance at the [ public ] meeting stated if an application was received from a group whom we believe were intent on causing racial hatred on the streets , then Strathclyde Police would oppose it .
“ Any request to hold a procession or assembly is made to the relevant local authorities who will , in the normal course of events , forward the application to the police and other interested parties as they see fit . ”
An SDL spokesman said : “ It will be a demo , We are not in a position to publish numbers but there is a lot of support from all over Scotland for this . ”
A spokesman for Glasgow City Council said he was not aware of an SDL application having been made yet .
The Times ’ Aug. 30 article , “ Marijuana ’s new high life , ” does a great job describing the cultural mainstreaming of marijuana .
Pot is indeed flourishing in “ civilized society ” as never before , and the movement to end decades of failed prohibition has picked up unprecedented momentum .
But that debate has largely ignored the people most impacted by our current policies -- the rising number of people , particularly young people of color , arrested on marijuana charges each year .
According to the Center on Juvenile and Criminal Justice ( CJCJ ) , the arrest rate for all offenses in California sank by 40 % from 1990 to 2008 , with arrests for rape and murder falling by more than 60 % each .
Drug possession arrests for everything but marijuana collectively fell by nearly 30 % in the same period .
Meanwhile , arrests for marijuana possession have skyrocketed -- up 127 % .
This rise in marijuana arrests is the ultimate outlier .
California made a major step toward decriminalizing low - level pot possession in 1975 , when it made possession of less than an ounce a misdemeanor punishable with a fine and no jail time .
That did n’t stop law enforcement from arresting more than 74,000 people last year -- the highest number since the 1975 law took effect .
More than 80 % of those arrests were for misdemeanor possession , the lowest - level offense .
Not surprisingly , given the way drug laws are traditionally enforced in this country , the burden has fallen disproportionately on people of color , and on young black men in particular .
According to the CJCJ , half of California ’s marijuana possession arrestees were nonwhite in 1990 and 28 % were under age 20 .
Last year , 62 % were nonwhite and 42 % were under age 20 .
Marijuana possession arrests of youth of color rose from about 3,100 in 1990 to about 16,300 in 2008 -- an arrest surge 300 % greater than the rate of population growth in that group .
Even more disturbing , African Americans account for an even higher portion of all marijuana felony arrests .
Blacks make up less than 7 % of the state population but 22 % of people arrested for all marijuana offenses and 33 % of all marijuana felony arrests .
More African Americans are arrested in California for marijuana felonies than are whites , even though whites are six times more represented in the state population .
The overrepresentation of African Americans is not explained by use rates .
According to the federal Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration , the percentage of African Americans and whites who use marijuana over any 30 - day period are similar .
However , for the 18 - 25 age group -- which constitutes a substantial proportion of marijuana arrests -- African Americans regularly use marijuana at rates lower than whites ( 16.5 % and 18.4 % , respectively ) , indicating that their overrepresentation may be even more profound .
Many people convicted of a marijuana felony may not go to prison ; they are likely to spend some time in jail before trial and then be sentenced to felony probation .
They may not be in San Quentin , but they have been brought under the supervision of the criminal justice system -- one of the single greatest predictors of future imprisonment .
An 18 - year - old convicted of a felony is headed nowhere fast .
In this sense at least , marijuana is indeed a gateway drug ; it is a feeder for the criminal justice system , disproportionately for black kids .
So while the purported mainstream is delighting to “ Weeds ” and contemplating the new revenue that state - regulated marijuana would generate , there ’s even greater urgency to ending the prohibition of marijuana .
California can’t wait any longer to end the racist enforcement of marijuana laws .
Stephen Gutwillig is the California state director of the Drug Policy Alliance .
INCOME SHIFTS INCOME SHIFTS
Change in median income from 2000 - 08 ( in 2008 dollars ) : Age Men Women 15 - 24 - 9.7 % - 3.3 % 25-34 - 11.7 % - 2.9 % 35-44 - 6.8 % - 0.8 % 45-54 - 11.2 % - 4.8 % 55-64 - 2.3 % 20.6 % 65-74 8 % 8.7 % 75 + 1.9 % 3.5 % Source : Census Bureau
The incomes of the young and middle - aged — especially men — have fallen off a cliff since 2000 , leaving many age groups poorer than they were even in the 1970s , a USA TODAY analysis of new Census data found .
People 54 or younger are losing ground financially at an unprecedented rate in this recession , widening a gap between young and old that had been expanding for years .
While the young have lost ground , older people have grown more prosperous over the years and the decades .
Older women have done best of all .
The dividing line between those getting richer or poorer : the year 1955 .
If you were born before that , you 're part of a generation enjoying a four - decade run of historic income growth .
Every generation after that is now sinking economically .
Household income for people in their peak earning years — between ages 45 and 54 — plunged $ 7,700 to $ 64,349 from 2000 through 2008 , after adjusting for inflation .
People in their 20s and 30s suffered similar drops .
Older people enjoyed all the gains .
The line between the haves and have - nots runs through the middle of the Baby Boom , the population explosion 1946 - 64 .
" The second half of the Baby Boom may be in the worst shape of all , " says demographer Cheryl Russell of New Strategist Publications , a research firm .
" They 're loaded with expenses for housing , cars and kids , but they will never generate the income that their parents enjoyed . "
What caused the income gap : • Waiting line for good jobs .
Older people are working longer , crowding out young people from the best - paying jobs while boosting the incomes of older workers and seniors .
• Global competition .
Low - income workers in other nations have pushed down wages in the USA .
Newly hired workers — generally younger people — experience the wage decline first , says economist Dean Baker of the Center for Economic and Policy Research , a liberal - leaning think tank .
• Golden age of retirement .
Social Security and private pensions have elevated the incomes of retired people to record levels and reduced poverty among the elderly .
One bright sign : Women have boosted income by holding half the USA 's jobs , working longer hours and narrowing the gender pay gap from 2000 , when women made 25 % less than men , to 2008 , when they made 23 % less .
Older , college - educated career women have had the biggest gains .
Terry Neese , founder of a human resources firm in Oklahoma City , says income shifts partly reflect changing gender roles and values .
As women bring in more income , men can work less or stay home with children , she says .
Neese says her own daughter , who now runs the family firm , worked less and went to more kids ' soccer games .
" My daughter says , ' I 'm not going to work like you worked , ' " says Neese , 60 .

China is spending $ 221 billion of its $ 586 billion 2009 stimulus package on renewable energy and other clean technologies , and is poised to overtake Germany and Japan to become the world ’s largest alternative energy producer .
Another spur to development is a 2007 policy requiring large utilities to produce 3 percent of their power from renewable sources by 2010 and 8 percent by 2020 , excluding hydroelectric ( 20 percent by 2020 is proposed in the Clean Energy and Security Act ) .
China ’s five - year plan that starts in 2011 will include even higher standards and subsidies to support clean energy development .
Though aspects of it may violate the WTO , China has a coherent industrial policy to capture global leadership , while US initiatives are fragmented .
China recognized that the real economic development potential in renewable energy is in manufacturing , which comprises 70 - 75 percent of the jobs in solar , and now has more than 100 solar companies that account for one - third of global solar component production .
Yesterday the House voted , overwhelmingly , to pass H.R.3585 , the Solar Technology Roadmap Act , which is meant to provide for U.S. research , development , and demonstration of solar energy technologies .
With China -- as well as several other countries -- pulling way ahead of the U.S. in alternative energy development , you would think supporting this kind of legislation would be a no brainer .
And , indeed every Democrat and 63 Republicans voted yes .
It passed 310 - 106 .
The Republicans with no brains ... well , generally speaking the Republicans sticking with their obstructionist leadership on this -- John Boehner , Eric Cantor , Mike Pence and Paul Ryan all urged no votes -- were the dimmest lights in the House , knee - jerk anti-everything fanatics like Michelle Bachmann ( MN ) , Paul Broun ( R- GA ) , Jason Chaffetz ( R- UT ) , John Culberson ( R - TX ) , Mary Fallin ( R - OK ) , Virginia Foxx ( R- NC ) , Trent Franks ( R - AZ ) , Elton Gallegly ( R- CA ) , Scott Garrett ( R- NJ ) , Darrell Issa ( R- CA ) , Steve King ( R- IA ) , Tom McClintock ( R-NC ) , Patty McHenry ( R-NC ) , Mean Jean Schmidt ( R - OH ) , and John Shadegg ( R - AZ ) , the real knuckle - dragging bottom of the barrel community ; Limbaugh 's crowd .
Speaker Pelosi points out that this legislation " lays the foundation for a future of renewable energy , sustainability , a growing economy , and good - paying jobs that cannot be shipped overseas .
This bill helps improve the performance and reliability of solar technology , and invests in critical research and development initiatives that will redefine how we power our homes and offices .
More solar technology means better energy security , more home - grown energy , and lower greenhouse gas emissions .
It returns the United States to the forefront of cutting - edge research and places the next generation of American workers on the frontlines of a clean energy future . "
Ralph Hall ( R - TX ) is the ranking member on the House Science Committee and he supported the bill -- as did conservative committee members like Lamar Smith ( R - TX ) , Dana Rohrbacher ( R- CA ) , Roscoe Bartlett ( R - MD ) and Mike McCaul ( R - TX ) .
Maybe they should ask obstructionists like Pete Hoekstra ( R - MI ) , Pete Sessions ( R - TX ) , Gary Miller ( R - CA ) and John Kline ( R - MN ) what they have against science and why they want to see America fail and fall behind our competitors .
Gabby Giffords ( D - AZ ) was the bill 's sponsor .
She was good on the House floor ( for a change ) :
Labels : clean energy , obstructionist Republicans
Jim Jeffcoat used to play for the Dallas Cowboys in the era when they won Super Bowls .
His son Jackson will play college football next year .
USA Today ran a profile of their family .
The article does n’t mention religion .
It just focuses on how the dad is a great role model in the family .
But check out the accompanying picture :
I count at least 17 crosses .
And we do n’t even see the whole wall !

At least I know what to send them for Christmas …
By Charles Krauthammer - August 21 , 2009
WASHINGTON --
Let 's see if we can have a reasoned discussion about end - of - life counseling .
We might start by asking Sarah Palin to leave the room .
I 've got nothing against her .
She 's a remarkable political talent .
But there are no " death panels " in the Democratic health care bills , and to say that there are is to debase the debate .
We also have to tell the defenders of the notorious Section 1233 of H.R. 3200 that it is not quite as benign as they pretend .
To offer government reimbursement to any doctor who gives end - of - life counseling -- whether or not the patient asked for it -- is to create an incentive for such a chat .
What do you think such a chat would be like ?
Do you think the doctor will go on and on about the fantastic new million - dollar high - tech gizmo that can prolong the patient 's otherwise hopeless condition for another six months ?
Or do you think he 's going to talk about -- as the bill specifically spells out -- hospice care and palliative care and other ways of letting go of life ?
No , say the defenders .
It 's just that we want the doctors to talk to you about putting in place a living will and other such instruments .
Really ?
Then consider the actual efficacy of a living will .
When you are old , infirm and lying in the ICU with pseudomonas pneumonia and deciding whether to ( a ) go through the long antibiotic treatment or ( b ) allow what used to be called " the old man 's friend " to take you away , the doctor will ask you at that time ) what you want for yourself -- no matter what piece of paper you signed five years ago .
You are told constantly how very important it is to write your living will years in advance .
But the relevant question is what you desire at the end -- when facing death -- not what you felt sometime in the past when you were hale and hearty and sitting in your lawyer 's office barely able to contemplate a life of pain and diminishment .
Well , as pain and diminishment enter your life as you age , your calculations change and your tolerance for suffering increases .
In the ICU , you might have a new way of looking at things .
My own living will , which I have always considered more a literary than legal document , basically says : " I 've had some good innings , thank you .
If I have anything so much as a hangnail , pull the plug . "
I 've never taken it terribly seriously because unless I 'm comatose or demented , they 're going to ask me at the time whether or not I want to be resuscitated if I go into cardiac arrest .
The paper I signed years ago will mean nothing .
And if I 'm totally out of it , my family will decide , with little or no reference to my living will .
Why ?
I 'll give you an example .
When my father was dying , my mother and brother and I had to decide how much treatment to pursue .
What was a better way to ascertain my father 's wishes :
What he checked off on a form one fine summer 's day years before being stricken ; or what we , who had known him intimately for decades , thought he would want ?
The answer is obvious .
Except for the demented orphan , the living will is quite beside the point .
The one time it really is essential is if you think your fractious family will be only too happy to hasten your demise to get your money .
That 's what the law is good at -- protecting you from murder and theft .
But that is a far cry from assuring a peaceful and willed death , which is what most people imagine living wills are about .
So why get Medicare to pay the doctor to do the counseling ?
Because we know that if this white - coated authority whose chosen vocation is curing and healing is the one opening your mind to hospice and palliative care , we 've nudged you ever so slightly toward letting go .
It 's not an outrage .
It 's surely not a death panel .
But it is subtle pressure applied by society through your doctor .
And when you include it in a health care reform whose major objective is to bend the cost curve downward , you have to be a fool or a knave to deny that it 's intended to gently point you in a certain direction , toward the corner of the sick room where stands a ghostly figure , scythe in hand , offering release .
Goofs
At the beginning , as Taw Jackson scouts the movement of the gold shipment , we see a half moon in the sky .
Two nights later , when Lomax rides into Emmett , there is a bright full moon .
Two days later , when the " war wagon " departs on its run , we again see a half moon in the sky .
Note the action of the movie takes place over only a four - day time span - too short a time for the moon to change from half , to full , to half moon again .

Text description provided by the architects .
Temporary actions , ephemeral marks
Four constrictions for four freedoms
One capable solid
One maximum volumetric surrounding .
We take it just as it is and affect it by the edge conditions chosen .
This fact makes it transform in singular object , to which its abstraction contributes autonomy , staying ephemeral marks in its carving .
One site to place
And the whole urban emptiness free for configure in harmony with the building .
They make it united , like a part of a topography that passes flatly to surrounding .
And with the whole choreography of accesses and attentive connections to the wealth of the urban trace , which solve in continuity diverse local heights , linking them both our building and others ; organizing wheeled traffic , and creating stay zones , so that it turns out to be an urban unitary space without need of sidewalks , walls , etc .
Ephemeral of the constructions results demonstrated in it .
One ethical determining
Order where there must come together in a natural way the interests of the clients and the society with those of the architect .
If there is a building where what today have passed to be mere topics of market ( ecology , sostenibilidad , constructive experimentation , new matters , etc ) make sense it ’s here , but indeed .
In the architects ’ house , in which we have the obligation to foment the advance and the investigation .
Independently of its current profitability , because of the didactic attitude that we must have towards the others , and for contributing to the effort of so many persons and companies , which open future ways to us ..
The building will be capable of receiving temporarily and incorporating novel solutions along its life .
And it constructs here the building and its image , its meaningful appearance , the changeable condition of the society and the environment .
And without damage of a precise and forceful form .
One evolutionary programme
Very diverse activities , some of them more public than other , but that advise transparency and presence in a society that today does n’t know us .
An space capable of continuous transformations in its use for a profession on the other hand accelerated .
A system of external circulations , as trunk of tree , autonomous from the particular organizations of the space that it wraps and acclimatize , allowing autonomous functioning of the building parts and the annexation among them .
Visions of ephemeral moments in the building ’s life .
In response to an evolutionary programme that tries to satisfy very diverse activities , some more public than different , and in which the capacity of adjustment and transformation in the time turns into an important factor , the building raises a organization capable of continuous transformations in its use .
The internal organization answers also to these criteria of flexibility , the minimal programme of the Central Office is distributed from a constant form in section , leaving cavities that , connected directly with the exterior circulation , can be used in an independent way and with different schedules , lodging also between both skins the spaces of relation and rest ..
There has been looked a building that , fulfilling perfectly its functional objective , contributes the attainment of an environment with the maximum possible quality , so much in the interior as towards the exterior .
On one hand seems to be desirable to demonstrate the presence of public , so important activity for the city , which in it is developed .
On the other one , this transparency will allow to incorporate the building life and cultural offers into the civil activities that develop in the square , extending hereby its social dimension in an environment nowadays degraded .
With the objective to implant these concepts , it is thought a few translucent and transparent , light , materials of front , laminated panels consisted of glass and insulating polymers , which interior can include the systems of air conditioning and captation of energy in the search of meeting between technology and architecture as convergent concepts .
An architecture which image answers to the materialization of a way of energy management , emaciated and produced betting for the classic passive skills joined with the application of new technologies .
And like in these " meetings " for that we look laboriously , this gives course to being fundamental part of the presence and essence of the building .
The application of new technologies materializes by means of the disposition in its south front and roof of a solar field of photovoltaic semitransparent cells to generate electric power by means of a system connected to the mains .
These cells will be integrated to the sheets forming the front as element that constructs its image and not as merely added .
The use of different photovoltaic modules will be defined depending on the need to contribute diverse degrees of transparency or opaqueness to the front , by means of cold configuration ( since the double glazing is provided by the interior skin ) and changing the system of enclosing .
So that they could do besides the function of solar protection , effect lattice , conceived as a set of clouds which density will change depending on the interior wished luminosity , trying to optimize the natural lighting in all the points of the building .
On the other hand the bioclimatic principle is based on the idea of the creation of one " microclimatic envelope " that is to say , of the surrounding translucent or transparent one that shelters the internal programme block .
The protected landscape that conforms between these two skins , creates a semipublic space with climatic exceptional conditions , where it is possible to spend more time " outside " on an exterior having offered to the interior .

" Il n'y a pas de vague de suicides " à France Télécom , estime René Padieu , inspecteur général honoraire de l'Insee , président de la commission de déontologie de la société française de statistique , dans une chronique à paraître dans le quotidien La Croix .
" En 2007 , on avait pour la population d'âge d'actif ( 20 et 60 ans ) un taux de suicide de 19,6 suicides pour 100 000 " , explique - t - il .
" 24 suicides en 19 mois , cela fait 15 sur une année .
L'entreprise compte à peu près 100 000 employés .
Conclusion : on se suicide plutôt moins à France Télécom qu'ailleurs " , affirme - t - il .
Selon lui , " ce qui fait sens ici n'est pas le chiffre lui-même , mais le fait de l'invoquer .
Relevons que la révélation des suicides en cause suit la création , par un syndicat , d'un " observatoire du stress " : quand on se met à observer quelque chose , on le voit apparaître " .
" On regrettera que les drames humains que sont ces suicides – peu nombreux , certes , mais bien réels – soient instrumentalisés dans l'affrontement entre une direction et ses salariés : c'est indigne " , ajoute M. Padieu .
" Croire en l'existence de quelque chose qui n'est pas constitue ce qu'en psychiatrie on appelle un délire .
Ici ce n'est personne en particulier , mais le corps social qui délire : salariés , direction , ministre , syndicat , journalistes , commentateurs , vous et moi tous ensemble " , ajoute - t - il .
" Ce qui est dit dans ce délire n'est pas réel : c'est quand même un symptôme .
Il signe quelque chose , un mal - être social " , reconnaît -il .

i Player is currently free for UK users Users of the BBC iPlayer should be charged " micro payments " to use the online catch - up service said Lorraine Heggessey , chief executive of TV production company Talkback Thames .
Ms Heggessey was speaking at a BBC event on Tuesday .
Tony Cohen , chief executive of Talkback 's parent company Fremantle Media , has also spoken out in support of a revenue model for all catch up TV .
Fremantle is currently conducting a feasibility study of the concept .
Most broadcasters now offer an online catch - up service , and with advertising revenue falling in the commercial TV sector , there is increasing industry support for the idea of charging for it .
Research carried out by Fremantle suggests that people would be willing to pay up to £ 2 for certain shows .
No plans However , the BBC says it has no plans to introduce such a fee .
" The cost of the BBC iPlayer is covered by the licence fee , so UK users have already paid for this service , " said a spokesperson .
The BBC spent £ 6 m developing its iPlayer service , which launched on Christmas day in 2007 .
During peak times it pumps out 12 GB of data per second to users - the equivalent of around 2400 MP3s .
Media industry expert Steve Hewlett , former director of programmes at Carlton Television , says that in theory the idea of paying to watch TV programmes online makes sense .
The BBC never thought it was appropriate to give away DVDs , so why should catch - up be free ?
Steve Hewlett " The BBC never thought it was appropriate to give away DVDs , so why should catch - up be free ? " he said .
" Traditionally , licence fee payers have paid for access on a TV set - and only for the first transmission . "
Mr Hewlett believes that a payment model similar to that operated by iTunes and Amazon would be an appropriate technical solution .
" The technology now exists that can make payment straightforward .
Once you have your account you tell it to buy , it 's easy - in essence it 's quite attractive .
At iTunes prices , I would pay . "
However for as long as the BBC iPlayer remains free , it would be difficult for other broadcasters to implement charges , he warned .
" It 's one of the ways in which the BBC can create unintended market impact , " he said .

A Washington DC man who assaulted a gay man who later died from his injuries has been jailed for 180 days .
Tony Randolph
Hunter died several days after being punched in the head by Robert Hannah , 19 .
The incident happened on September 10th 2008 .
As Hunter fell , he hit his head on the pavement , causing a fatal brain injury .
The victim and a friend were on their way to a local gay bar , something which gay activists have said could have been a motive for the attack .
The friend with Hunter at the time said the attack had been unprovoked .
Last month , Hannah pleaded guilty to one charge of misdemeanor assault as part of a plea bargain offered by prosecutors .
In exchange for the guilty plea , a charge of shoplifting against him was dropped .
He has already served two months in prison .
The sentence of 180 days is the highest that can be given for a misdemeanor assault conviction .
Hannah claimed Hunter had tried to come on to him and touched his groin and buttocks , which he said led to the assault .
Hunter ’s friend said he did not see the victim touch Hannah .
The defendant was with two other men at the time , one of whom backed up his statement , while the other said he had not seen the alleged sexual touching .
Gay groups have claimed Hannah used the gay panic defence and this was believed by the jury .
They have also questioned why Hannah ’s witness seem to be believed over Hunter ’s friend and why the charge had been reduced .
Police and the US attorney ’s office said last autumn that there was enough evidence to bring a manslaughter charge against Hannah .
However , a grand jury dismissed that charge and instead indicted Hannah on the assault charge , saying that Hunter ’s friend had given conflicting evidence and was an unreliable witness .
In a post apocalyptic future that appears as a blend of World War II Europe and J.R.R.
Tolkien 's Middle - earth , a pint - size wizard named Avatar must save the world from a band of fascist mutants controlled by his evil twin brother , Blackwolf , who likes to confuse enemy armies by projecting films of Adolf Hitler speeches during attacks .
Painted live - action footage of advancing Nazi armies contrasts with Saturday - morning - cartoon - style animation of fairies and elves as Avatar travels through various magical and radioactive realms on his quest .
Aiding him are the beautiful Fairy princess Elinore , hot - blooded warrior elf Weehawk , and Peace , a misunderstood robot rebelling against his Blackwolf - controlled programming .
A bizarre and psychedelic meditation on magic vs. technology , this ultimate futuristic fantastic epic cult film still finds an audience on college campuses and will prove quite rewarding to viewers in the right frame of mind .

One of Twitter 's strongest features is the @reply , where you can direct a message to someone else on Twitter by typing @ and then their username .
Facebook , which is trying to emulate some of Twitter 's best features , does n't have anything similar in the News Feed .
In short , it 's not easy to have a public conversation .
Very soon , that will no longer be the case .
Facebook just introduced the ability to tag your friends in status updates .
What makes this really interesting though is how you tag people : Using the @ symbol .
Facebook has just turned on their own version of Twitter 's @Mentions feature that will be rolled out over the next few weeks .
Here is Facebook engineer Tom Occhino 's explanation of the new feature :
Now , when you are writing a status update and want to add a friend 's name to something you are posting , just include the " @ " symbol beforehand .
As you type the name of what you would like to reference , a drop - down menu will appear that allows you to choose from your list of friends and other connections , including groups , events , applications and Pages .
Soon , you 'll be able to tag friends from applications as well .
The " @ " symbol will not be displayed in the published status update or post after you 've added your tags .
Friends you tag in your status updates will receive a notification and a Wall post linking them to your post .
They also will have the option to remove tags of themselves from your posts .
We hope that tagging your status updates and others posts from the Publisher will enable you to share in a more meaningful and engaging way , and connect with even more people .
We 're rolling this feature out over the course of the next few weeks , so you may not see the new feature just yet .
Summary :
The @ symbol now works just like Twitter , and not just for users , but for groups and fan pages as well .
Facebook has just stepped deep into Twitter 's territory .
How long until you can see your @reply history ?
We 're betting not very long at all .
This is a bad idea on many levels .
First off : cost .
It would cost a fortune not only to send the prisoners to Mars , but to build the proper facilities to sustain life on Mars would cost even more .
Secondly , there is plenty of room left on Earth to send prisoners .
Even in the United States , there is a lot of land still unsettled .
It would cost less to build a new prison here .
Thirdly , there would no doubt be problems in the government .
The bill would take months if not years to pass , and even then there would most likely be protesting , etc .
It 's just a bad idea in general .

SATURDAY , SEPTEMBER 12 , 2009
Just what we were talking about : Colbert Kings column in this mornings Washington Post is what weve been talking about .
King seems to have arrived on the planet at some point in 2008 .
His blinkered perspective forces liberals to argue a very narrow and highly inaccuratebrief .
King fails to name the very big players who are driving our politics into the ditch who have done this for the past several decades .
Instead , he starts with a couple of low - level nuts the kind of deeply unfortunate people who have always been with us :
KING ( 9/12/09 ) : On Aug. 16 , pastor Steven L. Anderson of Faithful Word Baptist Church in Tempe , Ariz. , told his congregation that he prays for the death of President Obama .
In a sermon titled " Why I Hate Barack Obama , " Anderson preached .
" I 'm not going to pray for his good , I 'm going to pray he dies and goes to hell . 
Anderson is not the only man of the cloth to wish widowhood upon Michelle Obama .
In June , the Rev. Wiley Drake of First Southern Baptist Church in Buena Park , Calif. , said he was praying for the president 's death .
Anderson , however , was explicit in his wish .
" I 'd like him to die of natural causes .
I do n't want him to be a martyr ; we do n't need another holiday .
I 'd like to see him die , like Ted Kennedy , of brain cancer . "
I pray God will not answer their petitions .
While I 'm at it , I 'm going to send up one for the men and women of the Secret Service who endeavor to protect the nation 's 44th president and his family .
Anderson and Drake are deeply unfortunate players in our national life .
But as he continued , King began to make us think he has just arrived on the planet .
He introduced a theme many liberals love a theme which blinds us to our nations recent history .
King has a stake in this theme , of course , based on his conduct in the last decade when he really was alive on this planet , pimping rap about Clinton and Gore :
KING ( continuing directly ) :
There 's something loose in the land , an ugliness and hatred directed toward Barack Obama , the nation 's first African American president , that takes the breath away .
The thread of resentment is woven through conservative commentary , right - wing radio and cable TV shows , all the way to Capitol Hill .
King goes on to discuss two recent murderers examples intended to reinforce the suggestion that the irrational hatred aimed at Obama exists because he is black .
George Sodini shot up a room full of white women , as King explicitly notes but his disturbed conduct somehow supports Kings case too .
Is the ugliness and hatred directed toward Obama caused by racial hatred ?
Presumably , some of it is .
But as he continues , King finally enters la-la land , saying this :  the depth of the hostility is extraordinary . 
That statement might seem true , of course if you arrived on the planet last year .
But similar hostility was aimed at the last Democratic president and the claims made against that president were just as lunatic as the claims against Obama , if not slightly more so .
In the case of Obama , King names a pair of no -name pastors .
In the case of Clinton , one of our most famous pastors was aggressively pimping serial murder charges and being accepted by Colbert Kings cohort as an honored Sunday morning news talker .
By the summer of Clintons second year in office , two active attempts were made on his life .
One guy even flew a small plane into the White House , apparently trying to kill him .
Colbert King doesnt seem to remember .
Might we suggest why that is ?
You see , King is part of a media elite which enabled or encouraged the lunatic claims against Clinton , then Gore .
Perhaps for that reason , people like King have airbrushed that decade and they express their vast surprise when the same thing is done to Obama .
Meanwhile , King name - calls two minor crackpot pastors and forgets to name the powerful players who are vastly more responsible for the lunatic claims against Obama .
King is brave when it comes to naming no -names .
Where are the names of the powerful players who have really been driving this lunacy ?
Somehow , when it comes to such names , people like King seem to get light - headed .
They may feel their knees start to buckle .
There have always been local lunatics like Anderson and Drake in our politics .
But the movement went national in the 1980s , when Rush Limbaugh moved to New York .
King has criticized Limbaugh a few times in the last year , that is .
But Limbaugh drove the lunatic hatred against the last Democratic president ( Hillary Clinton helped kill Vince Foster ! ) and King never mentioned his name , not once , during that whole brainless era .
( Nexis archives . )
King openly criticized Jerry Falwell after the 9/11 attacks , that is .
But Falwells name never appeared in his column during the 1990s , when he pimped those murder claims all around .
Somehow , King failed to notice that ugliness .
Or perhaps he was too scared to speak .
Like the bulk of his weak , weak - minded cohort , King failed to act in the 1990s .
This morning , he seems to have forgotten that the decade happened at all .
Might we make a long story short ?
King and his cohort bought all the crap against the last Democratic president .
Some of them actively encouraged the hatred ; some of them simply enabled it .
But by October 2000 , King could barely bring himself to say a word in favor of Candidate Gore .
To recall the pained column in which King made himself say that Gore would probably be somewhat better than Bush , see THE DAILY HOWLER , 1/26/09 .
In that column , you see how thoroughly these weak - minded people failed you in the last decade .
King and there rest of his cohort drank the Kool - Aid during that decade gulped it lovingly down .
Now , they pretend that the era never occurred and they express their vast surprise when the same lunacy is aimed at Obama .
They are amazed to see whats being said about this new Democratic president .
And they diddle their cowardly brains :
It must be his race , they proclaim .
In this way , people like King refuse to tell the real story .
Here it is :
Your discourse has been this way for decades .
A powerful movement generates ludicrous claims against all major Democrats .
They did it to Clinton , then to Gore with Kings blessing .
Now , it s being done to Obama .
So far , no one has flown a small plane into the White House .
But in the past , it was tried .
King ran off and hid in the woods while this was being done the last time .
( He was still bad - mouthing Hillary Clinton in the familiar old ways as late as summer 2008 . )
Now he pretends it just didnt happen .
And he makes it hard for liberals to argue the truth to help the public see the big picture about our devolving culture .
This isnt about unfortunate nuts like Pastor Anderson .
It is nt about an unfortunate nut like Drake , who at least is an equal opportunity kook .
( He also wished divine retribution on Pastor Rick Warren this year . )
This is really about the names and the movement which dont appear in Kings column .
It s about multimillionaire stooges like Limbaugh and Hannity and so many others like them .
It s about Charles Grassley and Sarah Palin .
It s about the astonishing Betsy McCaughey , the misleader - in - chief from 1994 who still cant seem to get herself profiled in Colbert Kings weak - kneed newspaper .
When it comes to the establishment Washington Post , the fake McCoys cant get arrested .
Uh-oh !
Charles Grassley is an accepted figure in Establishment Washington .
Voters deserve to hear what hes done .
But Colbert King wont say his name .
To this day , he never has .
Kings imagined self - critique :
At one point , King imagines a complaint against his column .
He has the world upside - down :
KING : Okay , now let me have it :  King , you 're generalizing , making a big story out of small , isolated examples .
People like Anderson , Broughton and Drake , and shooters Poplawski and Sodini , are kooks , representing no one but themselves .
Most people who oppose Obama do n't want him dead .
They wish him and his family no physical harm . "
I wo n't argue with that .
What I will say , however , is that a lot of malicious words have been thrown around about Obama since his election : words that inflame and that inspire the kind of hatred spewed from those two Arizona and California pulpits .
Malicious words have been thrown around ?
Colbert King is shocked shocked !
King has his problem upside - down .
In fact , he refuses to generalize , refuses to notice the big story  here the fact that this kind of malice has been aimed at all major Democrats in the past two decades .
But then , he himself purchased that malice last time .
For that reason , it must disappear .
There are 218 Halifax estate agency offices
Lloyds Banking Group has agreed to sell its Halifax estate agency business to LSL Property Services for £ 1 , and said 460 jobs would go .
The loss - making business has 218 offices , 93 of which are franchise operations .
There are 121 Halifax banking counters located in estate agents , which will close down in early 2010 .
Branches will be rebranded as one of LSL 's existing brands : Your Move , Reeds Rains or Intercounty .
Lloyds said that 1,050 employees would be transferred to LSL after the sale and 360 of the 460 jobs due to go will be full - time positions .
' No longer integral '
It said that compulsory redundancies would be a last resort .
The jobs will go among staff operating the banking counters within estate agents .
Lloyds said that the vast majority of the branches had a Halifax or Lloyds TSB branch within one mile of them .
Lloyds said that the decision followed a strategic review , " which concluded that an estate agency operation is no longer integral to its business model " .
UNITED NATIONS ( Reuters ) - Czech President Vaclav Klaus sharply criticized a U.N. meeting on climate change on Tuesday at which U.S. President Barack Obama was among the top speakers , describing it as propagandistic and undignified .
“ It was sad and it was frustrating , ” said Klaus , one of the world ’s most vocal skeptics on the topic of global warming .
“ It ’s a propagandistic exercise where 13 - year - old girls from some far - away country perform a pre-rehearsed poem , ” he said .
“ It ’s simply not dignified . ”
At the opening of the summit attended by nearly 100 world leaders , 13 - year - old Yugratna Srivastava of India told the audience that governments were not doing enough to combat the threat of climate change .
Klaus said there were increasing doubts in the scientific community about whether humans are causing changes in the climate or whether the changes are simply naturally occurring phenomena .
But politicians , he said , seem to be moving closer to a consensus on climate change .
“ The train ca n’t be stopped and I consider that a huge mistake , ” Klaus said .
U.N. Secretary - General Ban Ki-moon organized the climate summit to help create momentum before a U.N. meeting in Copenhagen in December to reach agreement on new targets for reducing so - called greenhouse gas emissions .
However , new proposals by China and a rallying cry from U.S. President Barack Obama did little to break a U.N. deadlock about what should be done .
Klaus published a book in 2007 on the worldwide campaign to stop climate change entitled “ Blue Planet in Green Chains : What Is Under Threat -- Climate or Freedom ? ”
In the book , Klaus said global warming has turned into a new religion , an ideology that threatens to undermine freedom and the world ’s economic and social order .

Advertisement Sony Entertainment has announced it is reducing the price of its PlayStation 3 games consoles .
In Europe the price has been lowered to 299 euros , in the US to $ 299 and in the UK to £ 249.99 .
Sony made the announcement at a press conference ahead of the 2009 games convention - gamescom - in Cologne .
It also announced it was ending production of its current PlayStation 3 console in favour of a new lighter , slimmer model with a 120 GB hard drive .
Growth of the PlayStation 3 has been slow compared to previous launches , which critics put down , in part , to an expensive price tag compared with its rivals , Microsoft 's Xbox 360 from £ 129 and the Nintendo Wii at £ 169 .
Speaking at gamescom , Sony Entertainment 's head , Kaz Hirai , said the change in price for existing PlayStation 3 stock would happen immediately and that the new slim - line PS3 would be available from the first week of September .
" It has the same features and functionality [ as the old PS3 ] , but now it is 32 % smaller , 36 % lighter and consumes 34 % less power , " he said .

Sony said there were now more than 23.7 m PS3 installed worldwide , with just over 10 m of those in Europe .
Comics reader
Sony also said it was expanding its catch - up TV service - which includes the BBC iPlayer .
It announced it was about to launch a video delivery service , via the PlayStation Network , that would allow PS3 or PlayStation Portable ( PSP ) users to rent or purchase movies - both blockbuster and local market - in either standard or high definition .
That service goes live in the UK , France , Germany and Spain this November and rolls out across Europe throughout 2010 .
The event also provided a first look at a new digital reader for the PSP - called Digital Comics - that will allow users to read Spiderman , Fantastic 4 and other Marvel comics on their portable , along with a range of graphic novels .
However , the new motion Sony Controller - which made its debut at the E3 Expo in Los Angeles in June this year - was not on show , with Sony saying people will have to wait until the Tokyo games show in September before it gets another public viewing .

Astrology is the study of the relative positions of celestial bodies and related details supposedly to understand , interpret , and organize information about personality , human affairs , and other terrestrial matters .
A practitioner of astrology is called an astrologer .
Because of the math involved in crafting astrological readings , many believers claim astrology is a science — but it really is n't .
Real science works because it deals with assertions that can be proven using careful experiments .
Astrology is often considered as pseudoscience by scientists , as it does not meet Karl Popper 's philosophy of falsifiability , and is considered an example of the Forer Effect .
[ 1 ]
Many astrologers consider themselves to be using scientific methods to show that scientific evidence is consistent with their understanding and interpretation of the heavens and its effect on human affairs .
[ 2 ]
Michael Behe , proponent of intelligent design , believes that astrology could be classified as a scientific theory under these conditions . [ 3 ]
According to a 2003 Harris Poll , thirty - one percent of the American public believes in astrology , with women more likely to do so than men . [ 4 ]
Nancy Reagan was a " dabbler " in Astrology .
[ 5 ]
She consulted astrologer Joan Quigley regularly for various purposes .
However , liberals are more likely to believe in it than conservatives .
According to a 2009 study by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life , over twice as many Democrats believed in astrology than Republicans ( 31 % to 14 % ) . [ 6 ]
The early Christian writer Saint Augustine strongly rejected astrology ; in his late 4th century book Confessions he disproves astrologers in several ways , but one of the clearest logical demolitions uses the story of Esau and Jacob :
" I then turned my thoughts to those that are born twins , who generally come out of the womb so near the one to the other that the short interval between them - whatever importance they may ascribe to it in the nature of things - cannot be noted by human observation or expressed in those tables which the astrologer uses to examine when he undertakes to pronounce the truth .
But such pronouncements can not be true .
For looking into the same horoscopes , he must have foretold the same future for Esau and Jacob , whereas the same future did not turn out for them .
He must therefore speak falsely .
If he is to speak truly , then he must read contrary predictions into the same horoscopes .
But this would mean that it was not by art , but by chance , that he would speak truly . "
- Confessions , Book Seven , Chapter VI
The Catholic Church has also spoken out against astrologers and fortune - tellers , although accepting that people are naturally curious about what the future has in store .
Pope John Paul II pointed out that in Acts 1:7 , Jesus stated that only the Father knows the time at which the Kingdom will be established , when responding to the curiosity of the Apostles .
The Pope argued that Jesus did not want us to waste time trying to work out things that only God can know , but rather use our time in the best way we can . [ 7 ]

Barack Obama has abandoned the controversial Pentagon plan to build a missile defence system in Europe that had long soured relations with Russia .
In one of the sharpest breaks yet with the policies of the Bush administration , Obama said the new approach would offer " stronger , swifter and smarter " defence for the US and its allies .
He said it would focus on the threat posed by Iran 's short - and medium - range missiles , rather than its intercontinental nuclear capabilities .
Obama announced the reversal officially at a news conference today .
" This new approach will provide capabilities sooner , build on proven systems to offer greater defences to the threat of attack than the 2007 European missile defence programme , " he said .
He phoned the leaders of Poland and the Czech Republic last night to tell them he had dropped plans to site missile interceptors and a radar station in their respective countries .
Russia had furiously opposed the project , claiming it targeted Moscow 's nuclear arsenal .
The change of tack had been prompted by advances in missile technology and new intelligence about Iran 's existing missile capabilities , Obama said .
The US president said " updated intelligence " on Iran 's existing short - and medium - range missiles showed they were " capable of reaching Europe " .
He added that the US would continue its efforts to end Iranian attempts to develop an " illicit nuclear programme " .
He said : " To put it simply our new missile defence architecture in Europe will provide stronger , smarter , swifter defences of American forces and America 's allies . "
During a visit to Moscow in July Obama indicated he was ordering a 60 - day review of the scheme .
According to today 's Wall Street Journal , the findings , to be released next week , conclude that Iran 's long - range missile programme is progressing more slowly than previously thought .
Citing US officials , the paper said the White House believes Iran 's short to medium - range programme poses a more potent and immediate danger .
In his press conference today , Obama made a point of rejecting Russia 's objections to the missile defence shield .
" Its concerns about our previous missile defence programmes were entirely unfounded , " he said .
The Russian response suggested Obama 's decision would not be met by any swift or generous concessions .
A foreign ministry spokesman , Andrei Nesterenko , described the move as " obviously a positive sign for us " but made clear the decision had been a unilateral one taken by Washington alone .
He suggested there had been no deals with Moscow on Iran or other issues .
" That would disagree with our policy of resolution of any problems in relations with any countries , no matter how difficult or sensitive they may be . "
The US decision will cheer many in government in western Europe who believed the scheme was an unnecessary provocation to the Russians .
But today the Czech Republic and Poland expressed disappointment at the White House 's decision to reverse track after six years of difficult negotiations .
Senior sources in Warsaw and Prague said they would insist on the Americans honouring pledges they made to the Nato allies in return for agreeing last year to the plan for missile defence deployments .
Alexandr Vondra , a former Czech deputy prime minister and ambassador to Washington intimately involved in the negotiations with the Americans , said he was surprised .
" This is a U - turn in US policy , " he said .
" But first we expect the US to honour its commitments .
If they do n't they may have problems generating support for Afghanistan and on other things . "
Under the Bush administration the Pentagon spent years planning and negotiating to place 10 silos with interceptor rockets in northern Poland and to build a large radar station south of Prague to defend against a perceived ballistic missile threat from Iran .
The central European countries were keen to acquire the US installations and other military hardware as partial security guarantees against a resurgent Russia .
Moscow claimed the project was aimed against Russia and threatened to deploy short - range nuclear weapons in the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad , which sits inside the European Union .
Obama 's climbdown is likely to be seen by Russia as a victory for its uncompromising stance .
Today , however , analysts pointed out the decision would help Obama secure Moscow 's co-operation on a possible new sanctions package against Iran and would further his desire to " reset " relations with Moscow following a dismal period under the Bush administration .
It would significantly boost the chances of a new treaty on strategic nuclear arms reduction between Washington and Moscow , they said .
Both the US and Russia have agreed to come up with a successor treaty to Start 1 by December , when the current agreement expires .
" Hardliners in Russia do n't want an agreement on Start .
It will be very difficult now for Russia to avoid an agreement , " said Ruben Sergeyev , a defence analyst in Moscow .
" It [ the decision to drop the US shield ] creates a very positive ambience , despite the fact it was really an artificial thing . "
The decision strengthens Dmitry Medvedev , the Russian president , who is due to make his first presidential trip to the US next week for the G20 meeting in Pittsburgh .
The Obama administration has been keen to boost Medvedev 's standing and authority at home , seeing him as a more moderate and less hostile interlocutor than Putin .
Today the Nato secretary general , Anders Fogh Rasmussen , said Obama 's decision was " a positive step " .
Rasmussen said he had been briefed by the US envoy to Nato about it .
But the timing of the announcement is regarded as disastrous by the Poles .
Eugeniusz Smolar , a former chief of Warsaw 's Centre for International Relations , said : " We are disappointed . "
But he added that the Polish government had been assured by the Americans that promises of training with Patriot missile batteries and help in modernising the Polish military remained valid .
A few weeks ago , in a cri de coeur to Washington , several senior eastern European officials and public figures wrote a public letter to Obama complaining that their security interests were being ignored by the west to improve relations with Moscow .
Rasmussen , in his first big speech , is to call tomorrow for a new relationship between the western military alliance and Russia , taking more account of Moscow 's security and strategic interests .
Russian experts said Obama 's decision could only be seen as an unambiguous concession to Moscow , adding that it would severely disappoint the new Nato countries of eastern Europe .
Yevgeny Miasnikov , a senior research scientist at Moscow 's Centre for Arms Control , said the US administration would now consider ways of assuaging the Poles and Czechs , which might include providing Poland with Patriot interceptors capable of shooting down short - and medium - range missiles .
" Obama has taken a step in the direction of improving US - Russian relations .
This will definitely help build a partnership , " Miasnikov said .
" Russia will also now make some concessions , maybe on strategic talks over nuclear arms reduction or maybe over Iran .
" Moscow will try to catalyse the process of improving US - Iranian relations and will facilitate dialogue between the two sides .
I do n't think threatening Iran is the way to solve this problem . "

Constructive stone : finite sets
Andrej Bauer
Just like in real life , constructive stones are easier to find than constructive gems , so let me start the series with a stone about constructive finite sets .
There are several possible definitions of finite sets .
The one that works best classically and constructively is the following .
Definition : A set `S` is finite when there exists a natural number `n` and a surjective map `e : { 1 , 2 , … , n} -> S` .
We call such an `e` a listing of the elements of `S` .
A listing `e : { 1 , 2 , … , n} ->
S` is conveniently displayed as a list ` ( e ( 1 ) , e( 2 ) , … , e(n ) ) ` .
Given objects `x_1 , x_2 , … , x_n` , not necessarily distinct , we may define the set
`{x_1 , … , x_n} = {x ; x = x_1 or x = x_2 or … x = x_n}` ,
which is finite because it is listed by `( x_1 , x_2 , … , x_n ) ` .
Note that a set may have many listings , and that an element may be repeated several times in a given listing .
Classical intuition might suggest that we can avoid such repetitions ( I can hear you thinking “ just remove the repetitions , it ’s obvious ” ) , however :
Proposition :
If every set has a listing without repetitions then the law of excluded middle holds .
Proof .
Consider an arbitary truth value `p in Omega` .
We need to show that `p or not p` holds .
For this purpose consider the finite set ` {T , p}` where ` T` is the truth value “ true ” .
By assumption , there exists a listing `e : { 1 , … , n} -> { T , p}` without repetitions .
We know that `n > 0` because `{T , p}` contains an element , namely `T` .
If `n = 1` then `T = p` , which means that `p` holds .
If `n > 1 ` then `T != p` , which means that `not p` holds .
In either case , `p or not p` holds .
QED .
Here are some basic properties of finite sets which hold constructively .
Proposition : ( a) Every finite set is either empty or inhabited .
( b ) If ` A` and ` B` are finite sets then so are the union `A \cup B` and the cartesian product `A \times B` .
Proof . ( a) Recall that a set is inhabited if it contains an element ( which is not the same as non-empty ) .
Suppose `e : { 1 , … , n} ->
S` is a listing of `S` .
If `n = 0` then the domain of `e` is the empty set , therefore `S` is also empty .
If `n != 0 ` then `S` is inhabited by `e ( 1 ) ` .
( b) Suppose `( x_1 , … , x_m ) ` and `( y_1 , … , y_n ) ` are listings of ` A` and ` B` , respectively .
Then `A \cup
B` is listed by `( x_1 , … , x_m , y_ 1 , … , y_n ) ` , and `A \times B` is listed by the “ matrix ”
`( x_1 , y_ 1 ) , … , ( x_1 , y_n ) ` ,
`( x_2 , y_ 1 ) , … , ( x_2 , y_n ) ` ,
… ,
` ( x_m , y_ 1 ) , … , ( x_m , y_n ) ` .
QED .
So far so good .
However :
Proposition :
The following are equivalent :
The law of excluded middle .
Subsets of finite sets are finite .
Intersections of finite sets are finite .
Proof .
It is well known that in classical mathematics the second and the third claims hold .
So we only need to show that each of them implies the law of excluded middle .
Suppose subsets of finite sets are finite .
Let `p in Omega` be a truth value and let `S = { 1}` .
The subset `{x in S ; p}` is finite by assumption , so it is either empty or inhabited .
If it is empty then `not p` holds .
If it is inhabited then `p` holds .
Therefore `p or not p` .
Next , suppose intersections of finite sets are finite .
Let `p in Omega` be a truth value and consider the sets `{T}` and `{p}` where ` T` is again the truth value “ true ” .
These two sets are finite , therefore by assumption their intersection `{T} \cap {p}` is finite .
If it is empty then `T != p` so `not p` holds .
If it is inhabited then `T = p` so `p` holds .
Therefore `p or not p`.
QED .
One way to interpret the last proposition is that we ’ve got the wrong definition of finiteness .
Non the less , it is the correct one , at least if you want such theorems as “ a polynomial has finitely many roots ” to hold .
In order to get something that resembles the classical notion of finite sets , we need to bring in decidability .
Definition : ( a) A truth value `p` is decidable if `p or not p` holds .
( b ) A subset `D \subseteq
S` is decidable if , for every `x in S` , `x in D` or `not ( x in D ) ` . ( c ) A set `S` is decidable if , for all `x , y in S` , either `x = y` or `x != y` .
Proposition : ( a) A decidable subset of a finite set is finite .
( b)
The finite subsets of a decidable set are closed under unions and intersections .
Proof .
I will leave this one as an exercise .
If you try to solve it , make sure you know precisely where you used the assumption of decidability .
Let me finish by saying that in computer science the sort of data structures which are usually called “ finite sets ” correspond to our decidable finite sets because it is assumed that the elements can be compared for equality .
If you try to implement a data structure for finite sets which does not use equality ( or a linear order ) , you will be unable to define intersection and several other operations .
Gordon Brown said that an investigation must be held into the case .
" There 's got to be an inquiry into this , " the Prime Minister said .
" We have got to end the discredited old system that did nobody any good , once and for all . "
Germany is known for both its innovative engineering and its sausages , so the technical leap could seem almost inevitable .
But it was the high hurdles put up by the city ’s bureaucracy that fathered the invention of these unusual contraptions that are now as much a part of the city ’s sights as the television tower in Alexanderplatz or the cathedral , outside of which Grillwalkers also hock their sausages .
Image A Grillwalker , with a canister of flammable propane strapped to his back , sold bratwurst for $ 1.75 at the Berlin Alexanderplatz .
Credit ... Oliver Hartung for The New York Times
After losing his job in hotel management in 1997 , Bertram Rohloff wanted to open a stand to sell sandwiches , but found he could not get the necessary permits to set up shop .
So instead he envisaged an evolution in food - preparation technology , a step beyond the rolling hot - dog cart , because without the necessary permits , neither the grill nor the sausages could touch the ground .
“ You could n’t get an A - 1 location like Alexanderplatz for all the money in the world , ” Mr. Rohloff said in an interview recently in the company ’s home base in the Friedrichshain neighborhood in the former eastern part of the city .
And the salesmen ’s mobility allows them to follow the crowds , with Grillwalkers popping up outside nightclubs on busy evenings , at major parades and even at union demonstrations , which Mr. Rohloff said were among the best places for business .
As he worked on the invention , Mr. Rohloff considered everything from burning charcoal to hooking the grill up to a car battery  which he rejected because it would run down in just 10 minutes  before settling on propane .
He designed it with an automatic cut - off mechanism for the gas , to ensure that it was safe in the event of an accident .
Mr. Rohloff was the first person to don his invention and sell bratwurst on the street .
He now has 15 employees selling sausages around the city in teams of two ; they take turns wearing the grill and reloading the sausages , rolls and condiments .
But his ambitions extend far beyond the German capital , and the 17 to 30 cents in profit made on each sausage .
In all , the company has built 73 Grillwalkers , including the newest one , which sits in his office , sharing space with towers of jumbo buckets of mustard stacked against the wall .
He has subcontractors renting them in cities around the country , from Hanover to Karlsruhe .
And Mr. Rohloff has sold the equipment , at $ 7,100 a piece , to customers in Bulgaria , Colombia , South Korea and elsewhere , including one to a man in Nebraska .
Just this week he sold one to a client in South Africa , which next year will host the World Cup soccer tournament .

The goings - on of red state Republican officials are n’t usually national news , but this story from Boise is a fitting postscript to a week that started with Second Amendment activists bringing guns to a presidential speech and muttering about “ forcefully resisting ” the government .
Challis McAffee , a Ron Paul - supporting Republican Party leader from a suburb of Idaho ’s capital city , was arrested and charged with aggravated assault with a deadly weapon for pointing a gun at a homeowner .
Why was he confronting the homeowner ?
Well , he was hired “ to document the condition of homes where mortgages are past due or in foreclosure . ”

GARDEN CITY , N.Y . ( AP ) 
A suburban New York City prosecutor has decided not to file criminal charges against a university student who falsely claimed she was gang - raped in a dormitory bathroom .
Nassau County District Attorney Kathleen Rice says Hofstra University freshman Danmel Ndonye must undergo mental health treatment and perform community service in exchange for not being prosecuted .
Rice described the 18 - year - old as " deeply troubled . "
The student had claimed she was attacked Sept. 13 following a dance party at a Long Island campus nightclub .
Four men were arrested .
But the woman changed her story three days later when she was confronted with a cellphone video of the encounter , which indicated the sex was consensual .
The accused men were released .
One of their attorneys said the video looked " more like a porn movie . "

Dear Cecil :
Why do we nod our heads for " yes " and shake them for " no , " instead of the other way around ?
Are there any peoples who reverse the gestures ?
Have to Know , Chicago
Cecil replies :
Believe it or not , H. , some people think this is a silly question .
Little do they know .
No less a personage than Charles Darwin looked into it and wrote up his findings in a book called The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals ( 1872 ) .
Darwin was interested in finding out whether there were universal gestures and expressions , so he sent out a questionnaire to missionaries and whatnot that , among other things , asked what gesticulations the locals used to convey “ yes ” and “ no . ”
Nodding and head - shaking turned out to be pretty common , but there were some striking exceptions .
For example , certain Australian natives , when uttering a negative , “ do n’t shake the head , but holding up the right hand , shake it by turning it half round and back again two or three times . ”
One Captain Speedy —
I ca n’t say the name inspires much confidence — told Darwin that the Abyssinians said “ no ” by jerking the head to the right shoulder and making a slight cluck , while “ yes ” was expressed by the head being thrown backwards and the eyebrows raised for an instant .
The Dyaks of Borneo supposedly raised their eyebrows for “ yes ” and slightly contracted them , “ together with a peculiar look of the eyes , ” for “ no . ” Eskimoes nodded for “ yes ” and winked for “ no . ”
The only place I know of where they completely reverse the meaning of our nod and head - shake gestures is Bulgaria .
There a nod means no and a shake means yes .
One shudders to think of the implications this has for cross-cultural dating in that country .
The Turks are almost as confusing — they say “ yes ” by shaking their heads from side to side , and “ no ” by tossing their heads back and clucking .
Head - tossing for “ no ” is also common in Greece and parts of Italy , such as Naples , that were colonized or heavily influenced by Greeks in ancient times .
Still , cultures ranging from the Chinese to the natives of Guinea nod and shake their heads like we do , leading Darwin to believe that the gestures were innate to some extent .
He noticed that when babies refused food they almost always turned their heads to the side , whereas when they had worked up an appetite they inclined their heads forward in a nodding gesture .
Other gestures are much more arbitrary .
One of the most notorious of these is making a circle with thumb and forefinger , which to to Americans and most Europeans means “ OK . ”
In Brazil , however , and some other places , it means something on the order of “ screw you . ”
( The actual term is more pungent , you understand . )
Cecil learned this to his sorrow on a little jaunt he made to Sao Paulo some years ago .
I seldom make the OK gesture at home , but once I got down south and learned its obscene significance I felt a sudden compulsion to make it 20 or 30 times a day , thus antagonizing Brazilians by the thousands .
It was only with the most determined effort that I was able to stifle this low impulse and make the thumbs - up sign that , in Rio as in the U.S. , signifies everything ’s copacetic .
Which reminds me .
You probably think we make the thumbs - up gesture because that ’s what the Romans used to do when they wanted to spare a fallen gladiator , right ?
Wrong — that ’s a myth based on a succession of mistranslations .
The truth is when the Romans were feeling merciful they hid their thumbs in their clenched fists ( symbolically sheathing their swords , some historians believe ) .
To have a guy offed they did n’t turn thumbs down but rather extended their thumbs in a stabbing gesture .
For whatever reason , though , thumbs - up today means OK just about everywhere — except in Sardinia or Greece , where it means “ screw you . ”
I ’m told that for rookie travelers this makes hitchhiking in Athens a pretty lively experience .
Caveat viator .
And now this message of moral uplift
Dear Cecil :
With reference to your column on gestures , did you leave out or just not know that in Greece the five fingers spread out and thrust forward at someone means “ [ poo ] in your face ” ?
I learned it as a child while living in Greektown and it really came in “ handy ” at times .
— Had to Tell You , Chicago
Thank you for sharing that with us , H. Just shows you how the Greeks continue to enrich civilization .
Crossed signals
Dear Cecil :
I ’d like to add some info to your column on gestures .
The misunderstanding regarding the thumbs - up , thumbs - down gestures and ancient Rome began with a 19th - century French artist named Jean Leon Gerome and his painting Pollice verso .
Gerome is n’t a household word today , but he was a painter of international renown in his time , the leading academic artist of the period .
He was also a learned classicist who specialized in archaeologically correct history paintings .
The Jenney Latin textbooks of my misspent youth used to use Gerome ’s work to illustrate Roman customs .
His Pollice verso , in which a gladiator stands astride a fallen foe and looks up to the Colosseum ’s bleachers for the crowd ’s verdict , was a tremendous hit back in 1874 , and called forth considerable scholarly debate on whether the thumbs up and down he painted amidst the crowd were the correct interpretation of the Latin phrase pollice verso , “ with turned thumb . ”
Alexander Stewart bought the painting from Gerome , brought it to America , and published a pamphlet about the work in which he proved to the satisfaction of his contemporaries that pollice verso was a matter of turning the thumb up or down .
Gerome ’s artistic reputation went into eclipse after his death , but his gladiator paintings had considerable influence on early Hollywood ’s epics about pagan Rome , and that ’s how we got our current interpretation of thumbs up and thumbs down .
My young lady is Philippine , and she says that when Filipinos want to signal agreement or approval they raise their eyebrows .
They have no analogous gesture to signal disapproval , however , shaking their heads instead .
— F.J.R. , Lawrence , Kansas
It is still not totally clear what gestures the Romans used to indicate go / no go at gladiator .
Pollice verso has been translated to mean “ with thumbs turned inward , ” “ with thumbs turned outward ” ( in both cases as a stabbing gesture ) , and “ with thumbs bent back ” ( i.e. , thumbs up ) .
Hardly anyone contends that the phrase meant “ thumbs down . ”
On the contrary , some say thumbs down meant “ spare him . ”
Our opposite interpretation is largely Gerome ’s invention .

Ridge ’s Groveling Tour : I Never Meant To Accuse The Bush Administration Of Politicizing Homeland Security
A few weeks ago , former Bush Homeland Security Secretary Tom Ridge was thrust back into the public spotlight with news of his upcoming book , which is out today .
Of particular interest was Ridge ’s revelation that officials may have pushed him to raise the security alert level for political reasons on eve of Bush ’s re-election .
An excerpt from the book : A vigorous , some might say dramatic , discussion ensured .
Ashcroft strongly urged an increase in the threat level and was supported by Rumsfeld .
There was absolutely no support for that position within our department .
None .
I wondered , “ Is this about security or politics ? ” Post - election analysis demonstrated a significant increase in the president ’s approval rating in the days after the raising of the threat level . …
I consider the episode to be not only a dramatic moment in Washington ’s recent history , but another illustration of the intersection of politics , fear , credibility and security .
Original DVD cover
Ridge was immediately ripped by loyal Bushies for speaking out .
A spokesman for former attorney general John Ashcroft said , “ Now would be a good time for Mr. Ridge to use his emergency duct tape . ”
Ridge is now trying to get back into their good graces .
He has been on an apology tour this week , insisting that he never meant to insinuate any bad motives on his former colleagues . [… ]
In all the appearances he criticized people for misinterpreting what he had written : – But there ’s never been any doubt in my mind that any of these individuals , Secretary Powell , Attorney General Ashcroft , Secretary Rumsfeld , the FBI Director Mueller , they ’ve always had the security of America as the number one reason they would say , let ’s go up or let ’s not go up .
I do n’t think it ever was politics . ” [ CNN , 9/1/09 ] – “ ” Is there any other reason that ’s out there and perhaps this — expressed it unartfully — but I ’m not suggesting that anybody in that room on that occasion or any other occasion was interested in doing anything other than the right thing to protect America . ” [ ABC , 9/1/09 ] – “ I was musing in the book , as I was trying to think back on those discussions . …
Is there something else that I am missing or my department ’s missing ?
Pure and simple .
It ’s not an accusatory statement .
Was n’t intended to be .
And if people want to talk about it in that fashion , in this world — see , security is not black and white . ”
[ Fox News , 8/31/09 ]
( Video at link )
Speaking of Faux News , it appears that they barely even remembered who Tom Ridge was until he went on his groveling tour .
From MEDIA MATTERS ( August 21 , 2009 ) :
Big surprise , right ?
Former Department of Homeland Security Director Tom Ridge admits in his upcoming book that he was pressured by very senior Bush White House officials to raise the nation ’s terror level warning and to do it for purely for political reasons .
The story ’s a big deal and it ’s been widely reported and commented upon in the last 24 hours .
Except at GOP - friendly Fox News , of course , which continues to play dumb about the news story .
According to TVeyes.com , since the terror level story broke yesterday , CNN has mentioned “ Tom Ridge ” on the air at least 41 times , MSNBC has done it 62 times , and CNN ’s Headline News , which covers fewer stories each day , mentioned “ Tom Ridge ” 18 times so far .
Any guesses for Fox News ?
Did I mention FNC was playing dumb on an epic level ?
If you guessed t- w - o , you are correct .
According to TVeyes , Fox News has been able to almost completely ignore the Ridge story .
It basically does not exist .
Four sentences .
To date , that ’s been the sum total of Fox News ’ reporting on the Ridge controversy .
The four sentences were aired on Thursday ’s Special Report , which was then re-broadcast during the overnight .
From the raw story :
During a three - part interview with former U.S. Secretary of Homeland Security Tom Ridge on Tuesday night , MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow made some hard - hitting points on revelations that the “ Terror Threat Level ” system was manipulated for political purposes during the Bush Administration .
On the program to promote his new book “ The Test of Our Time ” , the former Pennsylvania governor seemed taken aback as Maddow took him to task as being a “ crucial ” part of a “ false case to the American people . ”
As Jay Rosen aptly tweeted , “ To work himself out of the bind she had gotten him into , Ridge actually disavowed the jacket copy of his own book under Maddow ’s questioning . ”

Europe 's climate targets of cutting carbon emissions by 30 per cent by 2020 and 80 per cent by 2050 may not be tough enough to get developing countries into a worldwide global warming deal , John Prescott has warned .
In an interview with The Independent , the former Deputy Prime Minister , who brokered the current climate treaty , the Kyoto Protocol , said a 90 per cent cut might be needed in order to secure an agreement at December 's UN climate conference in Copenhagen .
Countries such as India are likely to ask rich Western countries to cut back on atmospheric CO2 still further so that developing countries can continue to expand their economies and pull more of their people out of poverty , said Mr Prescott , who has taken on an influential new role as the rapporteur on climate change for the Council of Europe .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
They believe the developed world has done most to pollute the atmosphere , and so developed countries should do most to clean it up , Mr Prescott said – adding that he thought the European Union targets might have to be toughened to a 40 per cent interim cut by 2020 and a 90 per cent cut by 2050 .
Otherwise , he said , India , China and other developing countries would not agree to cut their own emissions in a new climate treaty .
Mr Prescott knows all about how to reach climate deals having played a central role in brokering the Kyoto agreement in December 1997 after negotiations in the Japanese city had reached deadlock .
Now he is returning to a major role in climate politics ; both with the Council of Europe , which is holding its own pre-Copenhagen conference in Strasbourg later this month , and in the UK .
From 21 September , he will be touring English schools lecturing on the importance of the meeting , and this week he is in China giving a speech on the need for a climate deal at Xiamen University .
Mr Prescott said that the European model of future cuts – already regarded as very demanding to some developed countries – would not be tough enough to bring the developing world on board at Copenhagen , where the international community will seek to replace Kyoto with a treaty that is capable of keeping the temperature rises of global warming to below C , thought to be the maximum that society can safely endure .
" The targets we 've set are not going to be accepted by the developing countries as fair , " Mr Prescott said .
" Europe has set a 20 per cent cut as an interim target , which will become 30 per cent if we reach a deal at Copenhagen , but the developing countries are likely to say it should be 40 per cent , and 90 per cent as the long - term target .
" The current European figures , which I take to be the template , are not enough to make an agreement with the developing world .
I do n't think there 's any doubt about it – the rich countries have got to give more on emissions .
The heart of the developing countries ' argument is : ' You carry the highest burden because you 're the polluter ' .
And India 's being much more truculent about this , saying , ' Listen , you should clear it up while we get on with our development ' . "
Mr Prescott believes that equity has to be central to any deal – that is , the sharing out of the amount of carbon emitted globally , without causing a climate catastrophe , must be fair .
But he is aware that there are many obstacles to an agreement .
Europe 's proposed cuts , never mind not being tough enough for China and India , may be seen as too tough by some of the rich countries .
" Securing a deal will be 10 times more difficult than Kyoto , " he said .
" But the climate change we 're experiencing across the world has been caused by developed counties .
They must now recognise that the polluter pays . "
Pensioner sells her old nude pics to pay the bills
A German pensioner struggling to make ends meet has been forced to sell old nude pics of herself to pay the bills .
Battling 75 - year - old grandmother Marianne came up with the idea after she was robbed of her worldly possessions and found she could no longer live off her small pension .
Marianne L. lives in a small apartment on the west side of Berlin without a sofa or a chair , having lost nearly everything while moving to a new home .
“ I was robbed , ” she said .
“ Expensive perfumes , rare vinyl ... even the only photo of my mother .
Everything ’s gone ! ”
After paying her rent and bills , her pension only leaves her with 146 Euros a month to live on ­ that amounts to a paltry 4.90 Euros a day for three meals a day and anything else she might need .
Old , poor and alone , the once fun-loving granny Marianne saw no way out of her financial dead - end - other than by selling off her only treasure she has left , the erotic photos taken in her youth .
The photos , which she keeps carefully wrapped in an envelope in her drawer , show a 20 - year - old Marianne posing happy and naked next to a tree .
“ The photos were taken in 1954 by my husband at the time .
I heard that the men pay money for such photos online , and I need money badly ! ” , said the desperate Marianne .
If she manages to sell her pictures , she might be able to buy herself a chair or even a sofa .
Until then , the grandmother happily reminisces of the girl she once was : “ When I ’d go out , all the guys would turn their heads , ” she laughed .
She does n’t know how much money she can make with the photos , but she hopes the old magic might work one more time .

Research in behavioral finance suggests that participants in financial markets are not fully rational actors .
Instead , they tend to act upon cognitive biases and emotional reactions that slant their estimates of risk and influence their perceptions of financial data .
In a study that I conducted with Andrew Lo and Dmitry Repin of MIT , we found that emotional reactivity to financial markets was correlated with trading performance .
Specifically , “ … subjects whose emotional reactions to gains and losses were more intense on the positive and negative side exhibited significantly worse trading performance , implying a negative correlation between successful trading behavior and emotional reactivity ” ( p. 352 ) .
In that study , we found , no single set of personality traits was significantly correlated with favorable trading outcomes .
Rather , it was emotional reactivity overall that seemed to best predict profitability .
These results would seem to support the common perception that success in financial markets requires an elimination of emotion from trading decisions .
A corollary of this view is that all good trading must be rationally conceived , planned , and executed : that good traders are those , as the saying goes , that “ plan their trades and trade their plans . ”
The problem with this perspective is that it does not fit the realities of trading floors at the firms where I work as a psychologist and coach .
Traders , even the most successful , are often highly emotional and competitive .
Many sustain significant profitability year after year trading actively each day , holding positions for mere minutes .
Invariably these very active traders have no time to research their trades , not to mention develop formal trading plans .
Research into implicit learning suggests that people routinely apprehend complex patterns in the world without necessarily being able to verbalize those patterns .
For instance , young children can form grammatically correct sentences and yet cannot explain the rules of grammar .
Very active traders develop a “ feel ” for markets that enables them to act on short - term shifts in momentum without being able to formally lay out the rationale underlying their trades .
Antonio Damasio ’s research suggests that such implicit learning is cued by “ somatic markers “ : a felt sense of fit or non -fit when we perceive patterns in the world .
Such markers , for instance , may cue us to shift topics in a conversation when we sense that the other party is uncomfortable .
We may not be able to verbalize the reasons for the shift at the time–it occurs spontaneously in the flow of interaction – but we know it feels right in the context of discourse .
Very active traders describe a similar feel for what they do .
A market will be weak and suddenly the trader will perceive that “ we ’re having trouble going lower . ”
Quickly he enters bids into the order book , gets filled , and rides a reversal move higher .
Asked what made him think we were putting in a bottom , the trader simply replies , “ They just could n’t break ’em . ”
Damasio ’s contention is that the feel that accompanies implicit learning is indeed a kind of feeling : emotion is an integral part of decision making .
What makes emotional arousal detrimental to trading is not that emotion necessarily biases decision making , but that it can cover over the more subtle , felt somatic markers that alert us to subtle market patterns .
When we are frustrated with our profits and losses , we can no longer fully attend to what feels right when we process complex market relationships .
That leaves us out of sync with the market ’s conversations .
In Lo and Repin ’s study , ten experienced traders were connected to biofeedback equipment while they viewed financial markets .
Interestingly , all recorded significant physiological changes during such trading events as breakouts from price ranges .
“ Contrary to the common belief that emotions have no place in rational financial decision - making processes , ” the authors explain , “ physiological variables associated with the ANS [ autonomic nervous system ] exhibit significant changes during market events even for highly experienced professional traders ” ( p. 332 ) .
The intriguing implication of this work is that those who have immersed themselves in financial markets probably know far more than they know they know .
Their performance crucially hinges , not on brushing emotion aside , but in sustaining access to those implicit cues that literally embody expertise .
The Return of Buzz Lightyear
Disney 's space ranger Buzz Lightyear returned from space on Sept. 11 , aboard space shuttle Discovery 's STS - 128 mission after 15 months aboard the International Space Station .
His time on the orbiting laboratory will celebrated in a ticker - tape parade together with his space station crewmates and former Apollo 11 moonwalker Buzz Aldrin on Oct. 2 , at Walt Disney World in Florida .
While on the space station , Buzz supported NASA 's education outreach program -- STEM ( Science , Technology , Engineering and Mathematics ) -- by creating a series of fun educational online outreach programs .
Following his return , Disney is partnering with NASA to create a new online educational game and an online mission patch competition for school kids across America .
NASA will fly the winning patch in space .
In addition , NASA plans to announce on Oct. 2 , 2009 , the details of a new exciting educational competition that will give students the opportunity to design an experiment for the astronauts on the space station .

WITH the success of “ Julie & Julia ” in movie theaters , and Julia Child ’s “ Mastering the Art of French Cooking ” storming best - seller lists , boeuf bourguignon  the film ’s slow - braised culinary centerpiece  has probably never been made by so many American home cooks , at least not in August .
Ms. Child ’s boeuf bourguignon is constantly cited for its authenticity .
Her recipe is , completely and perfectly , French .
( That said , her use of tomato is not strictly traditional . )
But although we ’re suddenly a nation of pearl - onion - peelers , Ms. Child ’s recipe is not the boeuf bourguignon that most French cooks would make .
“ Mastering the Art of French Cooking ” is actually a translation of French restaurant technique to American home kitchens .
Ms. Child learned at a professional culinary school , not from home cooks .
Her stew ’s painstaking multistep method  cooking all the vegetables separately , straining the sauce , etc.  has chefly fingerprints all over it .
On Saturday , Glenn Beck came to Seattle to speak at Safeco Field ( where the Mariners play baseball ) .
I went to the protest and brought my camera .
Some people paid up to $ 500 ( which included a photo of them shaking hands with Beck ) .
The common people paid $ 15 to sit up in the stands .
Seniors and students had a discount .
Oh , and the concession stands were n’t open , but box lunches were available for a fee .
After the reception , the lunch , the speech , and the book - signing ( all of which had a price tag ) , Glenn Beck was going about 60 miles north to get the key to the city from the mayor of Mount Vernon , WA .
Additional protests were planned for Mount Vernon .
Here ’s a link to the Seattle Times article : Glenn Beck 's Seattle event draws a few dozen protesters .
They say 30 protesters , but I 'm sure there were more .
More below the fold .
Q : Can you fit a bootable Fedora distribution into 100 kilobytes ?
A : You bet !*
* by cheating … read on .
Take an ordinary Fedora appliance as made by febootstrap or appliance - creator .
The appliance image is big because it contains copies of programs ( / bin / bash ) and libraries ( /lib/libc.so ) , the kernel and kernel modules .
It needs to , to make it self - contained .
But a technique we ’ve been using for a few months in libguestfs is to say : we ’re booting this appliance on a Fedora host .
Let ’s strip out all those programs and libraries from the appliance , and we ’ll add them back from the host just before we launch it .
I called such appliances “ supermin appliances ” , and now I ’ve ported the functionality from libguestfs into febootstrap so everyone can use it .
A supermin appliance is really small :
-rw-rw-r-- 1 rjones rjones 14 K 2009-10-22 12:43 hostfiles.txt -rw-rw-r-- 1 rjones rjones 87 K 2009-10-22 12:43 supermin.img
yet it ’s fully bootable , given the right sort of host :
It ’s really easy to use the new febootstrap to make your own super - small supermin appliances .
We ’ll start with this small shell script to make a supermin appliance :
#!/bin/sh - distro=rawhide febootstrap - i bash - i coreutils $ distro fedora febootstrap - minimize fedora cat > init << EOF #!/bin/sh echo Starting / init script ...
PATH=/sbin:/usr/sbin:$PATH touch /etc / fstab mount -t proc / proc / proc mount -t sysfs / sys / sys exec bash -i EOF febootstrap - install fedora init / init 0755 root.root rm init # Create the supermin appliance .
febootstrap - to - supermin fedora supermin.img hostfiles.txt # Create the ordinary appliance just for comparison .
febootstrap - to - initramfs fedora > ordinary.img
You will need to use febootstrap >= 2.5 , and set the distro variable so it exactly matches your base Fedora system ( eg. set distro=fedora - 11 ) .
The script below can be used to boot the appliance , and it ’s what I used to get the screenshot above .
#!/bin/sh - time febootstrap - supermin - helper \ supermin.img hostfiles .

The words ' you lie ! ' earned Joe Wilson a resolution of disapproval on the House floor last month .
' You lie ! ' worth $ 2.7 M for Wilson
The words " you lie ! " earned Joe Wilson a resolution of disapproval on the House floor last month .
But the outburst has certainly had its upside , netting him $ 2.7 million in third quarter political donations — with most of the money raised after his Sept. 9 outburst , according to Federal Election Commission reports filed Thursday evening .

Wilson's $ 2.7 million quarter is a fundraising anomaly — better than many Senate candidates and even some presidential candidates could hope for .
Democrats hope a simultaneous fundraising boost for Wilson ’s challenger , Rob Miller , will position him to make a viable run next November .
But Wilson ’s newly stocked war chest will give him plenty of resources to defend himself .
Most of Wilson ’s contributions came in amounts so small they do n’t meet the $ 200 threshold for reporting the names of the donors .
Of the big - dollar contributions he got , about $ 45,000 came before Sept. 9 and a little bit more than $ 593,000 came after .
The post - outburst checks , numbering nearly 1,200 , came from all across the country .
Wilson 's challenger , Rob Miller , had not yet reported his third - quarter fundraising reports
Borlaug won the Nobel Peace Prize and US Congressional Gold Medal
Norman Borlaug , the man known as the father of the Green Revolution in agriculture , has died in the US state of Texas aged 95 .
Prof Borlaug won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1970 for agricultural innovation and the development of high - yield crops .
The Green Revolution helped world food production more than double between 1960 and 1990 with Asia , Africa and Latin America in particular benefiting .
The Nobel Institute said he had helped save hundreds of millions of lives .
Prof Borlaug died late on Saturday evening at his home in Dallas from complications with cancer , said a spokesperson for Texas A&M University , where he had worked .
' A better place '
In the early 1960s Prof Borlaug realised that creating short - stemmed varieties would leave food plants more energy for growing larger heads of grain .
His high - yield , disease - resistant dwarf wheat quickly boosted harvests in Latin America , and his techniques were particularly successful in South Asia , where famine was widespread .
Analysts believe the Green Revolution helped avert a worldwide famine in the late 20th century .
A close friend of Prof Borlaug at Texas A&M , Dr Ed Runge , told Associated Press news agency : " He has probably done more and is known by fewer people than anybody that has done that much ...
He made the world a better place . "
The Nobel prize presentation said Prof Borlaug " more than any other single person of his age ... has helped to provide bread for a hungry world " .
Prof Borlaug continued his work into his 90s .
At a conference in the Philippines in 2006 he said : " We still have a large number of miserable , hungry people and this contributes to world instability .
" Human misery is explosive , and you better not forget that . "
Norman Borlaug was born in Iowa in 1914 .
He studied at the University of Minnesota and later worked for DuPont and the Rockefeller Foundation .
He set up his wheat and maize centre in 1963 to train scientists .
Prof Borlaug was awarded the highest US civilian award , the Congressional Gold Medal , in 2007 .
TOKYO , Japan ( CNN ) -- Japanese authorities have released an American man who was jailed for allegedly trying to snatch back his children from his estranged wife .
Christopher Savoie was jailed in Japan after trying to get kids back from their mother .
Police in the rural southern town of Yanagawa let Christopher Savoie go Thursday without indicting him on charges of child kidnapping .
Officials said the indictment was " on hold , " but did not elaborate .
The prosecutor 's office in nearby Fukuoka said Savoie was released after he promised not to take his children back to the United States " in this manner , " implying he could not have any contact with the children .
Savoie , 38 , a Tennessee native and naturalized Japanese citizen , allegedly grabbed his children -- 8 - year - old Isaac and 6 - year - old Rebecca -- as his estranged wife walked them to school on September 28 in Yanagawa .
With the children , Savoie headed for the nearest U.S. consulate , in the city of Fukuoka , to try to obtain passports for them .
Screaming at guards to let him in the compound , Savoie was steps from the front gate but still standing on Japanese soil when he was arrested .
Watch how dad promised not to see kids »
Consulate spokeswoman Tracy Taylor said her office had been notified that Savoie would be released Thursday afternoon .
" We are pleased to learn that Mr. Savoie was released from police custody , " she said .
" We hope that we can work with the Japanese government to come to a long term solution on the issue of international parental child abduction . "
Watch how Savoie 's release was worked out »
Savoie and his first wife , Noriko Savoie , were married for 14 years before a bitter divorce in January .
The couple lived in Japan but had moved to the United States before the divorce .
Christopher Savoie remarried in February .
Noriko Savoie was given custody of the children and agreed to remain in the United States .
Christopher Savoie had visitation rights .
On the day that the children were to start school in August , Savoie learned that Noriko Savoie had fled with them to Japan .
After they went to Japan , Christopher Savoie filed for and received full custody of the children .
Police in Franklin , Tennessee , issued an arrest warrant for Noriko Savoie .
However , Japan is not a party to a 1980 Hague Convention law on international child abduction .
Japanese law also follows a tradition of sole - custody divorces .
When a couple splits , one parent typically makes a complete and lifelong break from the children .
Complicating the matter is the fact that the couple is still considered married in Japan because they never divorced here , police said .
In addition , Japanese authorities say , the children hold Japanese passports .
Foreign parents have had little luck in regaining custody , the U.S. State Department said .
Noriko Savoie 's mother did not want to talk about Christopher Savoie 's release on Thursday .
" I can not make any comment on this , for the sake of my grandchildren , " she said .
Upon hearing news of her husband 's release , Amy Savoie told CNN , " The elation lasted for a few minutes and now we 're back to square one , where there 's no closure .
We do n't have Isaac and Rebecca in a situation from which they were taken .
Isaac and Rebecca had a very , very happy situation here in Tennessee .
...
They have people who love them here . "

She said she did not believe the parties could work out an agreeable arrangement regarding the children .
" There are two parents who love these children and one of them has just been -- just cast aside . "
She said other parents in similar situations have contacted her .
" I think the focus for us will be , you know , we 'll become spokespersons , I suppose , for so many of these families . "
Yasuhisa Kawamura , a spokesman with the Foreign Ministry , said the government may reconsider signing on to the Hague treaty .
" Japanese government is also considering seriously to conclude this treaty on the grounds that this treaty would provide one of the most effective measures to protect the children after their parents divorced , " he said .

Republicans from the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence say that they will no longer participate in an investigation into the Bush administration 's interrogation policies , arguing that they were all for investigations until Attorney General Eric Holder outrageously called for investigations .
Investigations are one thing , but investigations are another matter entirely , a discombobulated Sen. Christopher Bond ( R - MO ) told the Washington Post .
" Had Mr. Holder honored the pledge made by the President to look forward , not backwards , we would still be active participants in the Committee 's review . "
We'd be investigating right now if it was n't for all this business about investigating !
Someone , fetch me the Tylenol , or at least explain to the sophomoric Mr. Bond , a man who refers to CIA agents accused of torture as " terror fighters , " that investigations inherently mean looking back at evidence , and cannot solely entail looking forward .
" Looking forward " is a euphemism for covering up past crimes .
The GOP is starting to sound like a broken record with this , " We'd be changing stuff if we did n't have to change stuff " anthem .
First , we heard this with health care .
" We 're psyched to change health care as long as we preserve private insurance companies ! "
And now it 's the same argument with the torture investigations .
" Of course we want to prosecute crimes !
As long as no one looks at any evidence , no witnesses are called , and absolutely no one acknowledges anything bad ever happened .
I can't hear you !
[ Fingers in ears ] LA , LA , LA , LA ! "
Really , what are the limits of this hapless quest for bipartisanship ?
There has to be a point where the Democrats accept that they are the adults in the room , and move forward with their promises of reform and accountability .
Thankfully , at least for the moment , Sen. Dianne Feinstein ( D - CA ) , the committee chairman , said she intends to press forth with or without Republican support .
" That study and investigation is being pursued , additional staff are being hired , and the committee is continuing the work with all due diligence . "
Good .
Unsurprisingly , investigations do better when they entail persons interested in the whole investigating part of the process .

Sunbathing is known to cause skin cancer – but it may also help people survive when they get it , scientists are reporting .
Two studies published yesterday showed that vitamin D produced by the action of the sun on the skin may help improve survival for patients with skin and bowel cancer .
The bizarre finding suggests that health warnings to avoid the sun have been too simplistic .
Some exposure to the sun is necessary for health – it is excessive exposure leading to burning of the skin that does the damage .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
A research team from the University of Leeds working with the US National Institutes of Health found a high level of vitamin D – suggestive of high sun exposure – protected patients with malignant melanoma , the deadliest form of skin cancer .
Those with the lowest levels of the vitamin D in their blood at the time of diagnosis were 30 per cent more likely to suffer a recurrence of the disease after treatment than those who had the highest levels .
Patients with the highest levels of the vitamin also had the thinnest tumours at diagnosis .
Results of the study , funded by Cancer Research UK and the NIH , are published in the Journal of the National Cancer Institute .
The findings add to the growing body of evidence that boosting levels of vitamin D could protect against a wide range of diseases , or extend survival with them .
The gloomy weather and long winter in countries north of 30 degrees latitude , such as the UK , means that a large part of the earth 's population is deficient in the vitamin between October and March .
The weight of evidence has grown so dramatically that governments around the world are reviewing their recommendations on the minimum recommended limits .
Professor Julia Newton Bishop , of the Leeds Institute of Molecular Medicine , who led the melanoma study , said : " It is common for people to have low levels of vitamin D in many countries .
Melanoma patients tend to avoid the sun as sunburn is known to increase the risk of the disease .
" Our results suggest that melanoma patients may need to get vitamin D by eating fatty fish or by taking supplements to ensure they have normal levels . "
Professor Newton Bishop warned against excessive use of vitamin D supplements , however .
" There is some evidence from other studies that high levels of vitamin D are also harmful .
So we should aim for a normal level rather than a very high one . "
In the second study , researchers led by Professor Kimmie Ng , from the Dana - Farber Cancer Institute in Boston , US , who followed more than 1,000 bowel cancer patients for nine years , found those with the highest level of vitamin D were half as likely to die from the disease compared with those with the lowest levels .
The results are published in the British Journal of Cancer .
Sara Hiom , director of health information at Cancer Research UK , which funded the study , said : " The key is to get the right balance between the amount of time spent in the sun and the levels of vitamin D needed for good health .
" Protection from burning in the sun is still vital .
People with lots of moles , red hair , fair skin and a family history of the disease should take extra care as they are more at risk . "
Vitamin D : Man-made healer
Vitamin D is the only vitamin that humans make themselves and is essential for the health of skin and bones .
It has attracted increasing attention in recent years as its role in preventing cancer and other conditions including heart disease , diabetes and multiple sclerosis , has been revealed .
Some experts believe the benefits of the Mediterranean diet may have as much to do with sun as with the regional food .
An increasing body of cancer and other medical experts say a healthy intake of vitamin D for people in the UK and northern Europe should be five to 10 times higher than the current recommended blood levels of 200 to 600 International Units a day , depending on age .
Others have suggested high levels may not be protective , and could even be dangerous .
An Ontario court has rejected a lawsuit brought by Rogers that alleged rival cable TV provider Shaw has violated a non-compete agreement , clearing the way for the two to fight it out on each other 's turf .
Toronto - based Rogers sued Shaw earlier this month over the Calgary - based company 's proposed $ 300 - million purchase of Mountain Cable , a TV provider based in Hamilton , Ont. Rogers told Ontario Superior Court Justice Frank Newbould that the two companies had a nine - year - old agreement to split English Canada between them .
Rogers said that Shaw 's move , which the company and industry analysts expect will be followed by more acquisitions in Ontario , would cause it " irreparable harm . "
Lawyers for Shaw said that no such deal existed , and that if it did it would have been illegal .
Newbould last week rejected Rogers 's assertions in making his decision .
" This harm is speculative in the extreme , " he said .
The judge also sided with another of Shaw 's arguments — that preventing it from acquiring cable providers in Rogers 's territory was harmful to competition because it only gave the small companies one potential buyer .
" [ The ] effect will be to deprive vendors of independent cable companies of the full value of their businesses , " Newbould said in his ruling .
Mountain has about 41,000 TV subscribers , 28,000 internet customers and 27,000 telephone subscribers .
In an ironic twist on Mapua artist Roger Griffiths ' protest withdrawal of his $ 190,000 savings in $ 20 notes from Westpac yesterday , the money was today back with Westpac .
Mr Griffiths deposited the cash at the Nelson Building Society in Richmond , but because NBS banks with Westpac , it has deposited the money there .
NBS general manager Ken Beams said today it did not hold huge amounts of cash .
" Westpac clears our cash for us .
It is better to sit in an account earning interest , and that 's where it will be now . "
He appreciated the irony .
" It 's ridiculous , really . "
Mr Griffiths said today he had no idea that would happen next .
" It 's just a little merry - go - round . "
However , he would not move the money again , and did not think his protest had been a waste of time , because of the support he had received .
Westpac declined to comment on the return of the money to its coffers .
Mr Griffiths withdrew the money yesterday in protest at not being given an $ 80,000 mortgage on a $ 385,000 Mapua property because as an artist he did not have a regular income .
Westpac said it had required Mr Griffiths to provide evidence of his ability to meet regular repayments , but the information was not provided for it to assess .
After nationwide publicity , Mr Griffiths has been overwhelmed with support through hundreds of emails , phone calls and comments posted online .
He rated it the best day of his life .
" It 's nothing against Westpac , it 's the principle of the thing .
I felt badly treated , " he said today .
He estimated that 90 per cent of the comments he received were positive towards his stand .
" Hopefully , Westpac will take that on board and change their customer relations , " Mr Griffiths said .
Comments on stuff .
co.nz included " Shame on you Westpac " and " This guy is my hero " , while others called it bank - bashing .
Westpac media relations manager Craig Dowling said today : " We are extremely sensitive in this environment to the attention banks are getting and the need for us to do things appropriately and work with our customers , and we intend to ensure we take that approach . "
Mr Griffiths has not closed his Westpac account .
Mr Dowling said the bank was still open to lending to him if he wanted to work with the bank in providing the information required .
Mr Griffiths said he was no longer seeking to buy the property , which was a private sale , as it had now been sold .
Mr Beams said that if Mr Griffiths applied for a mortgage from NBS , he would be treated like any other customer .
Mr Griffiths said he just wanted to get back to painting .

Imagine , for the sake of argument , that you only had time to experience 10 adventures in this state .
What would those journeys — so special to this purple - mountained mecca — be ?
Following are our suggestions .
See also : Readers tell us their favorites beyond our top choices .
CLIMB A FOURTEENER
At 14,060 feet , Mount Bierstadt ( above ) is one of the easiest to ascend , with a wide trail that winds its way through swamps , high - mountain meadows and boulder fields .
The journey begins at Guanella Pass , just south of Georgetown .
If you worry about having never climbed that high before , put your fears aside .
There are so many people – from young whippersnappers to truly elderly – hiking on weekends , it looks like a trip to the mall , but they ’ll offer assistance if you need it .
Long ’s Peak by moonlight just might be the ultimate adventure .
If that ’s not for you , climb one of the state ’s thirteeners , which are just as majestic but do n’t get the same attention .
You ’re likely to see one of the state ’s Rocky Mountain goats staring down at you from a rocky crag , an eagle flying high above , or ubiquitous marmots on the ascent .
If your health or other situations wo n’t allow you to climb , then take the Cog Railway to the summit of Pikes Peak .
Or drive to the top of Mount Evans .
No matter how you get there , you really will be “ on top ” of the world , and there ’s no feeling like it .

ATTEND A CONCERT AT RED ROCKS
Pack a picnic dinner , get there early and hope it ’s a full - moon night .
While your immediate goal is to sway the night away to good music , the side shows all add up to an experience like no other : the moon over the stage , lights of Denver in the background , sitting on rock - hewn seats , the smell of concert - goers ’ drug of choice .
Or go to a sunrise Easter service , no matter your faith .
EXPLORE MESA VERDE
Sometimes we tend to downplay what ’s in our own backyard , but as with other ancient ruins around the world , the cliff dwellings at this national park near Cortez should be visited over and over again .
Look and marvel on your own or take a ranger - guided tour for more insight into the people who once inhabited the more than 600 dwellings .
Only a small percentage of the archaeological sites have been unearthed , but there are enough open to the public to leave you with a sense of awe .
Alternatively , take a full - day tour of the Ute Mountain Tribal Park , where a Ute tribal member will guide you through the park ’s cliff dwellings and explain Ute history and the many examples of wall paintings and petroglyphs .
Tours begin at Tribal Park headquarters 20 miles south of Cortez .
Special tours , including those on horseback , are available throughout the year .
While there , stop at the Pottery Factory , where tribal members continue to paint traditional patterns and more modern ones on functional , museum - quality pots .
SINK INTO STRAWBERRY PARK HOT SPRINGS
Let ’s be honest .
One of the attractions of this place – besides the natural setting near Steamboat Springs – is that you can go au naturel after dark .
Masonry walls create pools of different temperatures , so you can always find one that ’s “ just right . ”
Spend the night in one of the rustic cabins , or better yet , choose the train caboose , because how many chances will you get to spend the night in a caboose with a fireplace ?
Other hot springs bubble from the ground in many areas of the state , including the great kahoona – Glenwood Springs .
Try some of the smaller ones for a more intimate setting :
Hot Sulphur Springs near Granby has several private pools and caves ; Mount Princeton
Hot Springs near Buena Vista allows visitors to sit in makeshift rock pools in the Arkansas River .
How cool ( hot ? ) is that ?
VISIT GREAT SAND DUNES NATIONAL PARK
Hike to the top of one of the state ’s greatest natural phenomena , then snowboard down , or just walk as most people do .
The park in the San Luis Valley is open 24 hours a day , so climb at sunrise or sunset or under a moonlit sky .
Marvel at the beauty of Crestone Peaks , especially during the spring or late fall when the tips are coated in white .
Then , in late spring or early summer , dip your toes in Medano Creek if it ’s flowing .
Climb to the top of Star Dune , the highest at 750 feet , for spectacular views and photo opportunities .
Visit during a meteor shower for an unhindered view – no lights , no obstructions – just sky and shooting stars .
TOUCH DINOSAUR TRACKS
Once upon a time , Colorado was mired in water and mud , making it the perfect place to record the wanderings of dinosaurs small and large .
You do n’t have to travel far to see footprints and bones from giants like the apatosaurus or those of fierce predators like the allosaurus .
At Picketwire Canyonlands on the Comanche National Grasslands south of La Junta , walk an interpretive trail that includes more than 1,300 tracks .
That ’s not the only place in the state where they left a big impression .
Several museums and trails near Grand Junction allow you to view bones and tracks in situ .
At Dinosaur Ridge in Morrison , tracks , bones and other fossils are etched in stone along the “ dinosaur highway . ”
LISTEN TO ELK BUGLE
Bring blankets , hot chocolate and other creature comforts , and plan to spend a few hours at dusk and into evening in Rocky Mountain National Park during the September - October rut , when males call out to and herd their “ harems . ”
Moraine Park is a favorite location for listeners , although it ’s now so overrun with cars and people that some of the magic has disappeared .
Avoid the crowds by driving into the park along less - congested roadways , and you might get lucky and hear some stray calls .
As an added bonus , the timing is perfect for aspen viewing , with the dancing leaves turning golden and red as night temperatures cool .
NAVIGATE A MOUNTAIN ROAD
Not those teeny passes , but big , burly , white - knuckle - inducing roads like Independence Pass between Leadville and Aspen .
At 12,095 feet , the top of the pass is well above tree line :
This is what it means to be in tundra .
This narrow road usually closes in September and opens in late May .
Independence is the state ’s second - highest paved road .
America ’s highest paved automobile road is the Mount Evans Scenic Byway .
That drive , completed in 1927 , is less scary than Independence but just as scenic .
The parking lot is at 14,130 feet , then you can hike a quarter - mile up a winding trail to the top of the peak at 14,264 feet .
( Another way to stand atop the world . )
A third option is Trail Ridge Road .
While behind the wheel or exploring the area , you can imagine that in winter , snow drifts can get as high as 25 feet tall at the highest elevation , 12,183 feet .
Even in July , cold winds blow across the tundra , but ground - hugging plants and flowers blanket the areas between lichen - covered rocks .
The state ’s economy and towns once were made or broken by the presence of iron rails .
Trains still hold a fascination for young and old .
Step back in time and ride one of the state ’s refurbished rail lines , from the Cumbres & Toltec Scenic Railroad in Antonito to the Georgetown Loop narrow gauge line , to the Winter Park Ski Train .
The Durango & Silverton runs daily excursions , even during the winter months .
The coal - fired engines pull refurbished cars through canyons and wilderness along the same tracks once traveled by cowboys and miners – even train robbers .
RAFT THE ARKANSAS RIVER
Take a leisurely float trip , or if you live for those adrenaline highs , steel yourself for the bumpy ride only a Class 5 rapids provides .
Whether you want a half - day or full - week excursion , steak lunches or a “ classical music ” cruise , you can find it through one of the area ’s many rafting companies .
Shop around for deals , but remember the wildest water is in early May as the snow pack melts .
Most companies run rafts through September , except of course , in drought years .
No need to worry about that this year , if January is any indication .

Here are four easy - to - moderate hikes to take in Rocky Mountain National Park .
Damian Conway 's Object Oriented Perl improved my programming more than any other book , when I first returned to programming .
By the time I joined the Perl Renaissance , I 'd learned more about how Perl 5 worked and how to think about approaching problems from Damian 's book and my own experiments based on his writings .
Perl 5's default object system is deliberately minimal .
It 's the combination of two existing ideas introduced in Perl 5 ( references and packages ) with a method dispatch system .
It 's very clever in its minimalism ; it enforces very little and almost never precludes people from using it to provide more powerful -- or merely different -- object systems .
It 's not easy to make a minimal system that flexible .
Unfortunately , there are a couple of warts .
It 's common knowledge that the default Perl 5 object system is a little bit too minimal .
Flexibility is good , but more people benefit from good defaults they only have to change when they 're doing something special .
Most of the other problems I have with the basic Perl 5 object system come directly from its influence : Python .
I laugh ( yes , a sardonic laugh ) every time a Python advocate says that Perl 5's object system is a bolted on hack , because Python has many of the same design problems .
Yet I digress .
One design decision which Perl 5 stole wholeheartedly from Python is the idea that methods are just subroutines invoked as methods .
Python 's has first - class functions and allows you to install them in namespaces with simple assignment :
class Foo : def bar ( self ) print " I 'm in bar ! " baz = bar def main ( ) : foo = Foo( ) foo.bar( ) foo.baz ( ) main ( )
This is not the place to debate the relative merits of Python versus Perl 5 syntax for doing so , but Perl 5 allows something very similar .
You can import ( ) methods into classes .
The Why of Perl Roles explains why this is important .
For the most part it works .
Unfortunately , when it does n't work , it really does n't work .
Super Fragile Explodealicious
Consider a silly example :
package Foo ; use Modern : : Perl ; sub new { bless {} , shift } sub foo { say shift . '-> foo ( ) ' }
Now subclass it :
package Bar ; use base ' Foo ' ;
You can successfully instantiate a Bar object and call foo ( ) on it :
Bar->new ( )-> foo ( ) ;
What happens if Bar needs to get a method from a role ?
Here 's a Baz package which ( manually ) imports a foo ( ) method into the calling class .
This method emits an informative message , then redispatches to the parent method :
package Baz ; use Modern :: Perl ; sub import { my $ caller = caller ( ) ; no strict ' refs ' ; *{ $ caller . ':: foo ' } = \&foo ; } sub foo { my $ self = shift ; say " foo ( ) in Baz role ! " ; $ self -> SUPER :: foo( @_ ) ; }
Unfortunately , now you can't call the foo( ) method on Baz objects anymore :
foo( ) in Baz role !
Ca n't locate object method " foo " via package " Baz " at ...
Insufficient Dynamicity
This error message makes little sense .
The foo( ) method within the Baz package generates this error .
The problem is how the SUPER : : method selector works in Perl 5 .
When the Perl 5 compiler encounters a function , it stores compile - time information in the internal data structure which represents functions .
This CV , or Code Value , contains a pointer to the package to which the function belongs .
At runtime , the SUPER : : method redispatch looks at the package into which Perl 5 compiled the current method , then looks in its list of parent classes to figure out which method to call next .
You can see the problem .
This behavior is , I believe , largely an artifact of a particular implementation -- likely the intersection of several sensible design decisions which combined to produce an unfortunate corner case .
Unfortunately , this behavior is unlikely to change anytime soon in Perl 5 ( no matter how broken a feature , you can't argue a non-existence proof for code no one can see ) .
The correct behavior is to redispatch based on the current class of the invocant .
This is what the SUPER module from the CPAN does instead .
Note that Moose solves this problem in a similar way .
How to measure the speed of light using chocolate and a microwave
Thanks to the advent of modern technology it is now possible for the common man to measure the speed of light within the confines of the kitchen .
Yes , now you too can measure a quantity that had plagued science for hundreds of years .
To perform this experiment you will need the following :
Equipment
Bar of Chocolate : dimensions greater than 18 cm x 8 cm
Standard Consumer Microwave Oven
Paper Towel
Tooth Picks
Ruler with centimeter measurement
Procedure
Examine the microwave , the rear surface as well as inside the door , looking for a label stating the frequency .
If there is no label containing this value , the majority of microwave ovens operate at 2.45 gigahertz .
If the microwave has a rotating turn table remove or disable it .
Remove the packaging from the chocolate and place on top of a piece of paper towel on a plate
Place the plate with the paper towel and the chocolate in the microwave , so that the chocolate is positioned with the longest sides facing the longest sides of the microwave .
Heat the chocolate in the microwave until it barely begins to melt , pausing the oven to check occasionally ( the time will vary with the oven , from 20 seconds to 90 seconds )
Once the chocolate has begun to melt remove it from the microwave , probe the surface for a pattern of hot melted spots , about the dimensions of a dime .
Use toothpicks to mark the hotspots , placing them in the center of the hotspots .
Measure the distance between the toothpicks , recording the data .
A note of safety :
It is possible to damage a microwave oven by trying to heat an inadequate amount of material , although highly unlikely in this case , if you are concerned this can be avoided by placing a pyrex vessel filled with water in the microwave as well as the chocolate .
How this works
To heat food , the microwave oven creates a series of standing microwaves , which excite water , fat , and sugar molecules , creating atomic motion , or heat .
In order to create standing waves the microwave is built so that the length of the interior is a multiple of the wavelengths of the microwaves .
This creates a pattern of hot spots where the microwave causes more atomic motion , these hot spots are the crests and troughs of the microwave , and the cooler spots are the areas in between .
The greatest heating occurs where the waves have the greatest amplitude ; because this is a standing wave this area remains the same .
When you measure the distance between two hotspots this is the distance from crest to trough or of half a wavelength .
Because we know the frequency of the wave ( f ) , as well as the wave length ( λ ) ( distance between two hotspots multiplied by 2 ) we can calculate the speed of the wave , which , being an electromagnetic wave , travels at the speed of light ( c ) , using the formula :
c = λ * f
Sample Calculation :
Measurement of hotspot distance = 6.1 cm
λ = .061 m * 2 = .122 m
. 122 m * 2.45e9 hz = 298900000 m/s
In sigfigs 299000000 m/s .
This value is incredibly close to the actual speed of light , considering the error involved in the methods used .
Once you finish this calculation you have successfully measured the speed of light , through a bar of chocolate .
The accepted value for c ( the speeed of light ) in a vacuum is 299,792,458 m/s .
Additional Tip : Grating the chocolate may give more precise results due to the greater surface area and less conduction of heat .
Thanks to Shen for the tip !
The US government is considering taking the humpback whale off the endangered species list in response to data showing the population of the massive marine mammal has been steadily growing in recent decades .
Known for their acrobatic leaps from the sea and complex singing patterns , humpback whales were nearly hunted to extinction for their oil and meat by industrial - sized whaling ships well through the middle of the 20th century .
But the species has been bouncing back since an international ban on their commercial whaling in 1966 .
" Humpbacks by and large are an example of a species that in most places seems to be doing very well , despite our earlier efforts to exterminate them , " said Phillip Clapham , a senior whale biologist with the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration ( NOAA ) .
The US government is required by law to review the endangered species status of an animal or plant if it receives " significant new information " .
The National Marine Fisheries Service , a NOAA agency , received results last year from an extensive study showing that the north Pacific humpback population has been growing 4 - 7 % a year in recent decades .
Public comment is being accepted until 13 October on the upcoming review , which is expected to take less than a year .
It is the first review for humpbacks since 1999 .
A panel of scientists will then study the data and report on their analysis in late spring or early summer .
It is unclear what the decision on delisting the humpback will be .
Some environmental groups are already opposing the possibility of a delisting .
Miyoko Sakashita , the ocean programs director at the Center for Biological Diversity , said that ongoing climate change and ocean acidification are emerging threats that may hurt humpback whales .
" Ocean conditions are changing so rapidly right now that it would probably be hasty to delist the humpbacks , " Sakashita said .
Ralph Reeves , who chairs the cetacean specialist group at the International Union for the Conservation of Nature ( IUCN ) , said the US should remove humpbacks from the list if populations have sufficiently recovered .
He said conservationists must " be prepared and willing to embrace success " if they 're to maintain what he called a " meaningful " endangered species program .
" The whole process , the credibility of it , depends on telling people that things are really bad when they 're really bad and telling people that they are n't so bad when they are n't so bad , " Reeves said .
There are an estimated 18,000 - 20,000 humpbacks in the north Pacific , up from just 1,400 in the mid-1960s .
A survey in the early 1990s of humpbacks in the north Atlantic showed the population at 10,600 .
The results of a follow - up to that study , expected by the end of the year , are likely to show this population has grown , too .
The global humpback population is estimated to be about 60,000 , according to the Swiss - based Conservation of Nature union .
Introduction
There are many different methods for solving the Rubik 's cube .
They can be divided into two broad categories : layer methods and corners first methods ( and there are sub - categories within these broad categories ) .
The method I use for speedsolving is a layer based method .
More specifically , the method I currently use is : cross , F2L , 3 - look LL ( I know some of the OLLs , so sometimes I can do a 2 - look LL ) .
If you are a newbie cuber then this description may not mean much to you , so I should add that it's the ' Advanced Solution '
I described in the Next Steps section at the end of this page .
Many years ago when I wrote this webpage there were many great websites that explained advanced and expert methods for solving the cube ( check out my Rubiks links page ) , however , there were very few that explained beginner methods .
This is the reason I wrote this page .
It 's not meant to be a totally comprehensive explanation , it 's really just some notes I threw together for some friends I was teaching .
I thought it might be useful for others , so I 've turned it into a webpage .
This beginner method requires memorising only a few algorithms , and when done efficiently can achieve solves of 60 seconds or faster .
I know people who can solve in 20 - 30s with a method like this .
I have n't been able to solve so fast with a beginner method , so do n't be too distressed if you can't either .
On the other hand , if you can do 30s solves with this method , then you are too good for this method and you should be learning an Advanced or Expert method !
Aside from minimal memorisation , another benefit of this method is that it is very scalable .
More algorithms may be added later to develop it into an advanced method , or if you 're really keen , an expert method .
This means you do n't need to scrap it and start again to move to an expert method .
Everything you learn here will be useful for more advanced methods .
Structure of the cube
We all know that 3x3x3=27 , however , rather than thinking about the cube as 27 little " cubies " , think about it as 6 fixed centres ( that can rotate on their own axis ) with 8 corners and 12 edges which rotate around it .
As the centres are fixed , the centre colour defines the colour for the face .
It 's important to remember this otherwise you 'll end up trying to do illogical ( mechanically impossible ! ) things like wondering why you can't work out how to put a corner piece in an edge position , or assuming that you 're looking at the blue face merely because 8 of the 9 cubies on it are blue ( if the centre is white then it's the white face ) .
Terminology
When describing the solution for the 2nd and 3rd layers , standard cube notation will be used .
Here 's what you need to know to read it :
F = front face B = back face R = right face L = left face U = up face D = down face
In addition to a letter , each move may be accompanied by an apostrophe or the number two :
A letter by itself means turn that face 90 degrees clockwise ( eg. F ) .
) .
A letter followed by an apostrophe means turn that face 90 degrees anti-clockwise ( eg. F ' ) .
) .
A letter followed by the number 2 means turn that face 180 degrees ( direction is irrelevant ) , ( eg. F2 ) .
So R U' L2 is shorthand for " turn the right face 90 degrees clockwise , then turn the up face 90 degrees anti-clockwise , then turn the left face 180 degrees " .
When thinking whether to turn clockwise / anti-clockwise , imagine that you are looking directly at the particular face you are turning .
For each algorithm , the notation is written with the assumption that the core of the cube remains fixed throughout the whole algorithm , and the faces just turn around it .
This means that you also need to know how to position the cube to start the algorithm .
For pictures and further detail about cube notation , have a look at Jon Morris ' cube notation page .
The Solution
The First Layer
The first layer is solved in two stages :
Form the cross
Insert the 4 first layer corners ( each corner is inserted individually )
I believe that the first layer should be done intuitively .
You need to understand it and solve it without learning algorithms .
Until you can do this , I would n't bother attempting the rest of the cube !
So , spend some time playing with the cube and familiarising yourself with how to move the pieces around the cube .
Now , here are some tips to get you started .
The Cross
I prefer to start with the white cross because I find white easier to quickly identify on a completely scrambled cube , however , you can use any colour .
There are 4 edge pieces with white ( ie. the 4 arms of the cross ) which have specific positions .
You can't put any white edge piece in an arm of the cross because the other colour on the edge cubie must match up with it 's centre on the middle layer .
Here is a pic of what a correctly formed cross looks like ( grey denotes cubies that are irrelevant to the cross ) .
Note that the white / red edge cubie matches up with the white centre and the red centre .
Ditto re the white / blue cubie .
Here 's a pic on an incorrectly formed cross .
Looking at the white face we do indeed see a white cross , however the white / red edge cubie does not match up with the red centre .
Ditto re the white / blue cubie .
This is bad !
For a detailed explanation of the cross , check out Dan Harris ' Solving the Cross page .
The First Layer Corners
Once you have completed the cross , completing the first layer requires inserting each of the 4 corners in separately .
The first thing to do is examine your cube and locate all of the top layer edge pieces - they will be sitting in either the first layer or the last layer .
Inserting the first layer corners should be done intuitively , not by learning algorithms .
To get you started , here 's a step - by - step example of one way to insert a first layer corner .
Step 1
The blue / red / white corner is sitting in the bottom layer ( the blue part is facing the bottom so we can't see it in this picture ) .
Turn the blue face 90 degrees anti-clockwise .
Step 2
Now your cube should look like this .
Move the D face 90 degrees anti-clockwise to line up the blue / white edge with the blue / white / red corner .
Step 3
Now that the blue / white edge and the blue / white / red corner have been lined up , re-form the white cross by turning the blue face 90 degrees clockwise .
Step 4
Now the blue / white / red corner is in its correct place .
Here are some tips for inserting the top layer corners :
Start with a first layer corner that is sitting in the last layer .
If there are multiple first layer corners in the last layer ( there usually will be ) , start with one that does not have the white part of the corner on the face opposite the white face .
Or , if you were using a different colour for the cross ( ' colour X ' ) , start with a corner that does not have the ' colour X ' part of the corner on the face opposite the ' colour X ' face .
When working with a first layer corner piece that is in the first layer ( but in the wrong first layer corner position ) , you will need to get it out of the first layer into the last layer , then insert it into the correct first layer corner position .
The same principle applies if a first layer corner piece is in the correct first layer corner position but needs to be flipped around .
You need to get it out of the first layer ( ie. into the last layer ) , and then re-insert it into the first layer the correct way around .
This is what the first layer should look like when finished .
The Middle Layer
The middle layer consists of one stage :
Insert the 4 middle layer edges ( each edge is inserted individually ) .
You only need to learn one algorithm ( plus the mirror algorithm ) for the second layer .
There are many more algs , but let 's just learn the essential one first .
First , locate a middle layer edge that is currently sitting in the last layer .
I 'm going to use the blue / red edge for this example .
This blue edge cubie in the last layer is the blue / red edge cubie .
In this picture , U=white , L= red and F= blue .
We can't see the other three faces , but obviously the R face is the one opposite the L face , the D face is opposite the U face and the B face is opposite the F face .
Now , position the blue / red edge piece so that the colour on the side of the cube ( blue in this case ) lines up with it 's centre .
Now perform the following algorithm : D L D' L' D' F' D F
If the blue / red edge piece was flipped the other way so that the blue was on the bottom rather than the red , you would position the cubie under the red centre and perform the following alg : D' F' D F D L D' L ' .
This is the mirror of the previous algorithm .
The axis of symmetry lies diagonally across the white face , and along the line which divides the blue face and the red face .
What if the edge piece is not in the last layer ?
The instructions above assume that the middle layer edge piece you are inserting is sitting somewhere in the last layer .
If some middle edges are in the last layer and some are in the middle layer in the wrong spot , always start working with the edge pieces that are in the last layer .
After you 've done this , sometimes ( but not too often ) you 'll be left with a middle layer edge piece that 's in the middle layer but in the wrong spot .
In this situation , you can use the same middle layer algorithms from above ( D L D' L' D' F' D F or D' F' D F D L D' L' ) to insert another edge piece into the middle layer edge position , thereby knocking the middle layer edge piece out of its spot and into the last layer .
Once you 've done this , the middle layer edge piece is in the last layer and you can deal with it in the usual way .
There is a short - cut to this problem , but as this is a beginner solution with minimal memorisation , I have n't included it here .
If you really want to learn it , take a look at Case Dd2 on Dan Harris ' site .
The red / blue middle layer edge piece is in the middle layer but not oriented correctly .
It needs to be moved to the last layer , then put back into the middle layer in the right way .
The Last Layer
The last layer ( " LL " ) is done in 4 steps :
Orient the edges ( 2 algs ) - i.e. form a cross on the D face .
Permute the corners ( 1 alg ) - i.e. get the corners in the correct position in 3D space ( do n't worry if they still need to be rotated ) .
Orient the corners ( 1 alg + mirror alg ) - i.e. flip the corners .
Permute the edges ( 1 alg ) - i.e. swap the edges around .
The cube should now be solved ! :)
All last layer algorithms are performed with the cross ( i.e. the first layer - white side in this example ) on the bottom .
Orienting the LL Edges
Once you have completed the first two layers ( " F2L " ) , hold the cube so that the white side is on the bottom .
The white side will be on the bottom for the remainder of the solution .
This means that the white side is the D side for all last layer algorithms .
On my cube , white is opposite yellow , therefore yellow is the U face for all last layer algorithms on my cube .
Note that your cube may have a different colour opposite white ( e.g. blue ) .
Now have a look at your last layer , and in particular , look at the last layer face - there are 4 possible patterns of LL edges that you may see .
State 1 State 2 State 3 State 4
Unlike with the initial cross ( where all the edges must match up with the white centre and with the centres on the middle layer ) , here all you need to worry about is getting all the last layer edges matching up with the last layer centre .
It does n't matter if the other colour on the LL edge piece does not match up with the colour on the middle layer centre .
Also , ignore the LL corners too .
It does n't matter what they are doing at the moment .
Now , let 's consider each of these LL edge states separately .
State 1
All the edges are already oriented correctly .
Move on to permuting the corners .
State 2
We are going to re-orient our faces for this algorithm .
The face you are looking directly at in this picture is now the U face ( it was the D face for when you were doing the second layer edges ) .
Perform the following algorithm : F U R U' R' F '
State 3
As with State 2 , the face you are looking directly at in this picture is now the U face .
Perform the following algorithm : F R U R' U' F '
State 4 State 4 is really a combination of States 2 and 3 , so all you need to do is perform the algorithm for either State 2 or State 3 .
Once you 've done this , you 'll see that your LL edges now look like State 2 or State 3 , so just perform the appropriate algorithm and you will have a cross on the LL .
Permuting the LL Corners
The two possible states are :
two adjacent LL corners need to be swapped ; or
two diagonal LL corners need to be swapped .
These are the only two possible states .
If you cannot identify one of these two states with your LL corners then one or more of the following must be true :
You have not finished the F2L .
Someone has ripped out a corner of your cube and put it in the wrong way .
Someone has ripped off some of your stickers and put them back in the wrong place .
You are not looking hard enough . ;)
Swapping adjacent corners
Hold the cube with the white side on the bottom , and the two corners to be swapped are in the front right top and the back right top positions .
Perform the following algorithm : L U' R' U L' U' R U2 .
To see an animated version of this algorithm , see the first algorithm on Lars Petrus ' Step 5 page .
On Lars ' site , the algorithm is being executed from a slightly different angle ( the two corners being swapped are front - top - right and front - top - left ) , but it is the same exact algorithm .
Swapping diagonal corners
Swapping diagonal corners can be done by executing the adjacent corner swap algorithm twice .
Perform it once to swap any two LL corners .
Re-examine you cube and you 'll see that now there are just two LL corners that need to be swapped .
Position it correctly for the final LL adjacent corner swap and perform the LL adjacent corner swap algorithm .
Orienting the LL Corners
There are 8 possible orientation states for the LL corners .
One is where all 4 corners are correctly oriented .
The other 7 look like this .
State 1 State 2 State 3 State 4 State 5 State 6 State 7
State 1 . Twisting three corners anti-clockwise R' U' R U ' R' U2 R U2
State 2 .
Twisting three corners clockwise R U R' U R U2 R' U2
To see an animated version of this algorithm , look at Lars Petrus ' Sune algorithm .
States 3 - 7
Once you know the algorithms for States 1 and 2 , you can solve any LL orientation State .
The remaining States can be oriented using a maximum of 2 algorithms .
You will need to do one of the following ( i ) the State 1 algorithm twice , ( ii ) the State 2 algorithm twice , ( iii ) the State 1 algorithm , then the State 2 algorithm , or ( iv ) the State 2 algorithm , then the State 1 algorithm .
In a previous edition of this solution , I had said that I 'm not going to tell you exactly how to combine the State 1 and State 2 algorithms to solve States 3 - 7 .
My reason for this was because it is important that you try to understand how the State 1 and the State 2 algorithms work , and that once you do understand them you will be able to work out how to use them to solve all the States .
I still believe this , however , I received emails from a few people who were having trouble with States 3 - 7 , so I decided to write some extra tips .
I still suggest that you try to work out States 3 - 7 by yourself , but if you are really stuck , have a look here : Orienting the Last Layer Corners : further tips .
Permuting the LL Edges
There are 5 possible permutation states for the LL edges .
One is where all 4 edges are correctly permuted .
The other 4 look like this .
State 1 R2 U F B' R2 F' B U R2 State 2 R2 U' F B' R2 F' B U' R2
This is almost identical to the algorithm for State 1 .
Only difference is the 2nd move and the 2nd last move .
For an animated version of this algorithm , see the Lars Petrus ' Allen algorithm .
The algorithm is being executed from a slightly different angle , but it is the same exact algorithm .
State 3 Apply the algorithm for either State 1 or State 2 .
Re-examine your cube and it will now look like State 1 or State 2 .
State 4 Apply the algorithm for either State 1 or State 2 .
Re-examine your cube and it will now look like State 1 or State 2 .
And that 's all you really need to know to solve the Rubik 's Cube !
With practice , you should be able to achieve times of 60 seconds ( or faster ) using this method .
Once your comfortable with this method and want to learn more , take a look at the following section .
Next Steps
If this beginner method is too easy and boring for you then consider the following .
Intermediate method
Solve each first layer corner + corresponding middle layer edge in one step .
This means that after the cross you only have 4 steps ( 4 corner / edge pairs ) to complete the F2L .
With this beginner method there are 8 steps : solve each of the 4 first layer corners , then solve each of the 4 middle layer edges .
I 'd suggest just playing around with your cube and figuring out the F2L corner / edge pairs yourself .
For some hints about solving the F2L intuitively , have a look at Doug Reed 's intuitive F2L guide .
If you 're still stuck and just want the algorithms , check out Dan Harris ' F2L page and Jessica Fridrich 's F2L page .
Learn the 4 specific algorithms ( or rather , 3 algorithms plus one mirror algorithm ) for each of the 4 different permutation states of the LL edges .
My beginner solution already shows you 2 of the 4 last layer edge permutation algorithms , the other two last layer edge permutation algorithms are Case # 5 and Case # 17 on Dan Harris ' PLL page .
Advanced method
Learn everything from the Intermediate method .
Learn the 3 - look LL .
This requires learning the 7 specific algorithms for the 7 different orientation states of the LL corners , and learning the 21 PLL algorithms ( permuting the last layer algorithms ) so you can permute the LL edges and LL corners at the same time .
A full 3 - look LL uses 30 algorithms .
For more details about the advanced method , check out t Rubiks Galaxia 3 - look LL , Dan Harris ' site and Lars Vandenbergh 's PLL page .
Expert method
Do the F2L in 5 steps ( first dot point from the Intermediate method ) .
Learn a full 2 - look LL .
This requires memorising 21 PLL algorithms , plus 57 OLL algorithms ( orienting the last layer algorithms ) .
For more details about the expert method , check out Dan Harris ' site , Joël van Noort 's site and Lars Vandenbergh 's site .
Other stuff
The method I 've documented here is what I believe to be a good beginner method .
The problem with some beginner methods is that they are not scalable - to improve your cubing you have to un-learn much of what you know and re-learn it in a different way .
This method focuses on memorising very few algorithms , but is structured in a way that allows for development into an intermediate or advanced method .
Other thing I should say is that I did n't actually devise any of the last layer algorithms in this method .
I merely chose a selection of existing algorithms ( sourced from a variety of places including Jessica 's site and Dan K's site ) and organised them into a simple solution method .

When Douglas Lee started searching for a job as an English instructor in Chengdu , he seemed just like any other American to his potential employers .
He was raised in Oklahoma , enjoyed listening to jazz and was a big fan of Woody Allen movies like “ Crimes and Misdemeanors . ”
But when he submitted a photo of himself , the 26 - year - old graduate of San Diego State University discovered that he had one blemish on his application :
He looked too Chinese .
By the end of a two - month job search , Lee had been rejected by seven employers , and for no other reason , he says , than being a Chinese American .
“ Some of them just straight up said they wanted someone more foreign , ” said Lee , who settled for a job as an administrator at North America ESL School in Chengdu , the capital city of Sichuan province in western China .

Lee ’s experience is hardly unfamiliar to many Asian Americans who have ventured to China in recent years to explore their roots , visit relatives or seek work opportunities .
With the Beijing Olympics just a year away and a flood of Chinese families sending their children to private language institutes , one of the hottest jobs in China is English instructor .
But Asian Americans are finding it tough to break into the industry because many schools prefer to have whites as English teachers .
“ In previous jobs , I ’ve had to deal with Chinese parents who have the mentality of ‘ White is right , ’ ” said Benjamin Newbry , associate director of the Princeton Review test - preparation company in Shanghai , who is white .
“ It ’s just the idea that somehow if you ’re white , it qualifies you , and skills do n’t really matter .
Being white becomes a plus on your job application . ”

As in the U.S. , there are laws in China prohibiting job discrimination based on sex , race or religion .
But in practice , many Chinese employers place hiring ads with specific requirements on age , gender and residence .
Companies routinely ask applicants for photos .
“ Most of the regulations are just general principle . . . and not enough to protect against discrimination in real life , ” said Liu Haobin , a labor lawyer in Beijing .
Newbry , who is responsible for hiring teachers at his center , said it was difficult not to consider race when adding a member to the faculty .
Most Chinese consumers expect a white teacher at a foreign - language school , he said .
And when the teacher is n’t white , Chinese parents are n’t shy about complaining .
Advertisement
“ A lot of them were up in my face , ” Newbry said .
“ They ’re pretty aggressive when it comes to their kid ’s learning environment . ”
The feelings among both parents and students were apparent at the Newave Education Center in Shanghai .
Shortly after his lesson had ended on a recent afternoon , a wide - eyed 8 - year - old ran out of the classroom to show off what he had just learned .
He went up to a secretary at the front desk , and -- with a big smile on his face -- proudly spelled his new English name , Steven .
“ I like foreigners , ” he said to a visitor , pointing out that his teacher was a white Australian .
“ White people can speak better English . ”
Later , a dozen toddlers , some clad in Snoopy and Mickey Mouse T - shirts , crowded into a small classroom at the school .
“ Of course I ’d rather have a foreigner ” as a teacher , said Lu Mingzhen , who had taken his 3 - year - old granddaughter to the class .
By that , he meant a white foreigner .
“ Their pronunciation is more precise . ”

The demand for white teachers has led some schools to hire people from France , Germany and other countries where English is not the primary language , said Maosi Yan , program director at Interlingua School , a small , privately owned center in Guizhou province , in south - central China .
In years past , people in Guizhou , Gansu , Sichuan and other remote areas of China often learned English from foreigners such as Peace Corps volunteers and others whose arrival and work were arranged through the Chinese and American governments .
For many of them , teaching English was a side job .
Nowadays , privately owned schools -- not the government -- bear the primary responsibility for bringing in English teachers .
Although some instructors said they wanted to come to China primarily to learn about the culture , the perks of the job are now attracting many more applicants .
In an online ad posted by Chengdu Meishi International School , native English - speaking teachers were being offered a fully furnished apartment along with a monthly salary of about $ 700 .
That ’s enough pay to live comfortably in this laid - back city famous for its giant pandas .
Advertisement
“ Chengdu is a good place because everything is cheap , the pay is pretty decent , ” said Paul Traynor , a senior tutor at English First Chengdu .
When asked about hiring for jobs like his , Traynor agreed that race is a factor .
“ You would n’t get the ugliest woman in the world to advertise makeup , ” he quipped .
For some whites , finding an English teaching job in China is almost effortless .
Matt Froude , a white , 27 - year - old Australian who teaches at Newave Education Center , did n’t even have to apply .
He said a Chinese employee of Newave approached him on a bus in Shanghai and asked if he wanted a teaching job .
And just like that , Froude joined the faculty .
But for Asian Americans who have spent their whole lives speaking English , the difficulties of landing and keeping such a job can be frustrating .

Jennifer Ashley , who graduated from Cal State L.A. in 2004 with a degree in English , believes race was a key reason she was dismissed from an English teaching position in Chengdu .
Though you would n’t guess it from her name or her appearance , Ashley is half - Chinese .
Though she lacks the stereotypical Asian features and is commonly mistaken for Latino back in California , she still did n’t meet the expectations of her students and employers at the vocational school where she worked .
“ It seems like there is a prevailing notion that foreigners and Americans have blond hair and blue eyes , ” she said .
“ Oftentimes they would ask me , ‘ Why do n’t you have blond hair ?
Why is your hair dark ? ’ ”
When her term ended , her contract was n’t renewed .
Ashley ’s employer did n’t offer any explanation .
She stayed on in Chengdu , co-founding an English - language magazine .

KWL charts aid reading comprehension .
That 's what they were designed for at least .
What 's a KWL chart ?
Let me explain .
Before reading a book each student writes down what they already know and what they want to know .
Then afterward they write down what they 've learned .
They do this for two reasons .
First , by forming questions they activate prior knowledge , which makes it easier them to learn .
Second , it 's easy for both the teacher and student to see exactly which ideas the student is and is not getting from the text .
That 's the theory anyway .
In practice , every kid hates KWL charts .
Or at least I did .
Why ?
They 're completely useless .
That 's how they seemed at least .
Plus they were annoying .
" I already know know how to read , I already get the story , why are you making me fill out this dumb chart ? ? "
But ultimately all this kvetching may have been a mistake .
Why ?
As it happens , KWL charts are probably the single most important tool to improve creativity .
The reason is this .
Every brilliant idea starts with a question .
For example , let 's say I want to know more about how it is that institutions and organizations use social status to exploit people .
Chances are if I 'm asking myself this question then this is n't my only question .
Chances are I have a bunch of related questions .
Like , how can one use the promise of social status in business to get employees to accept lower wages ?
How is social signaling corrupting our schools and universities ?
And so on .
The point is that when thinking about any sufficiently large topic you 'll probably have one main question and then a whole bunch of sub-questions .
The problem is that when you start researching these questions you begin to learn .
That does n't sound like a problem , but it is .
What ends up happening is that you acquire all these new models that sorta answer your questions .
For example , maybe you read Rosabeth Moss Kanter 's academic papers on why people join cults like scientology .
This all seems really insightful and intellectually gratifying .
The problem is that this new knowledge displaces your original questions , even if they are n't fully answered .
And what happens is that your original questions often do n't seem as relevant or important in light of your new learning .
Even when they are .
Breakthrough insights always come from thinking about the space in between established knowledge and a good set of questions .
And unless you write down your questions and theories in advance , what always happens is that you read a few books and then forget your original theories about how things worked .
Which is bad , because they 're often at least partially correct .
So you had this brilliant idea , or at least the start of a brilliant idea , but thanks to your research it 's been lost forever .
Even if you have n't completely forgotten your original theories , your new insights become inextricably bound with background knowledge in a way that makes it impossible to communicate your learning to the outside world .
What happens is that you end up sounding like Shulgin trying to explain his experience with mescalin : " I understood that our entire universe is contained in the mind and the spirit .
We may choose not to find access to it , we may even deny its existence , but it is indeed there inside us . "
What the fuck .
Here 's how to avoid this problem .
Whenever you 're thinking about a big problem , write down all your questions and background knowledge in advance .
Do n't just write down your main question , write down every question whose answer could conceivably be insightful or useful to your intended audience .
Then write down all your background knowledge .
Not just a paragraph or two , but write down all your subject knowledge and all your theories of how you think things are working .
( Preferably in a mindmap . )
Do n't do any research until this is done .
Not even a Google search .
What ends up happening is that when you have both your questions and your background knowledge written down , it becomes ten times easier to think clearly about whether your reading is truly answering your questions .
It 's infinitely easier to come up with and recognize new ideas .
And what 's more , you still have your original questions written down so you have a clear framework for expressing your ideas to others .
The takeaway is this .
You do n't need a new method for coming up with brilliant ideas .
You already have them .
But sadly as you continue to learn these brilliant ideas are often lost .
By using the KWL method you not only preserve your original insights , but you can use your research to expand upon them as well .
By setting up a purposeful system that allows us to diff our background knowledge against existing models we can generate far bigger insights than would otherwise be possible .
Introducing Boson , a command / task framework that could change how you collect and execute your ruby code .
Sure , there ’s rake , thor and a dozen other gems .
But how many will let you create a universe of ruby commands you can run from the commandline and irb ?
Spinning On
Feel free to follow Boson on the Hub and to install it :
$ gem install boson boson - more $ echo " require ' boson / more ' " >> ~/.bosonrc
To get an idea of Boson ’s features , here ’s an outline :
Like traditional command frameworks , Boson executes commands ( tasks ) from the commandline :
# Let 's list boson 's default libraries bash > boson libraries +----------+----------+------+--------------+
| name | commands | gems | library_type |
+----------+----------+------+--------------+ | core | 6 | | module | | web_core | 3 | | module |
+----------+----------+------+--------------+
2 rows in set #
And default commands bash > boson commands
+--------------+----------+-------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
| full_name | lib | alias | usage | description |
+--------------+----------+-------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+ | usage | core | | [ name ] [-- verbose ] |
Print a command 's usage | | libraries | core | | [ query = ' ' ] [ -- index ] [--query_fields=A , B , C ] | List or search libraries | | render | core | | [ object ] [ options={} ] | Render any object using Hirb | | load_library | core | | [ library ] [ -- verbose ] [ -- reload ] | Load / reload a library | | commands | core | | [ query = ' ' ] [ -- index ] [--query_fields =A , B , C ] | List or search commands | | menu | core | | [ output ] [ options={} ] [ &block ] |
Provide a menu to multi-select elements from a given array | | get | web_core | | [ url ] |
Gets the body of a url | | install | web_core | | [ url ] [ -- force ] [--name=NAME ] | Installs a library by url .
Library should then be loaded with load_library .
| | browser | web_core | | [ *urls ] |
Opens urls in a browser |
+--------------+----------+-------+--------------------------------------------+-----------------------------------------------------------------------------+
9 rows in set => true
But unlike others , you can do the same in the ruby console :
bash > irb #
You could drop this line in your irbrc >> require ' boson ' ; Boson.start Loaded library core Loaded library web_core => nil >> libraries +----------+----------+------+--------------+
| name | commands | gems | library_type |
+----------+----------+------+--------------+ | core | 6 | | module | | web_core | 3 | | module |
+----------+----------+------+--------------+
2 rows in set => true >> commands # same as above ...
How is this done ?
Commands are simply methods on Ruby ’s top level object , main .
You provide the methods and Boson manages and empowers them .
Even with more complex command usage , the shell / irb duality holds :
# Print basic command usage in irb irb >> commands '- h ' commands [ query = ' ' ] [ -- index ] => nil #
Or in your shell bash > boson commands -h # same as above ... # Search command fields full_name and description for ' lib ' and sort by full_name irb >> commands ' full_name,description:lib -- sort full_name '

Creating a Boson command is as easy as opening a module and defining a method :
# Drop this in ~/.boson/commands/brain.rb #
The module name can be anything but it makes sense to name it the same as the file .
#
The module is evaluated under Boson : : Commands module Brain # Help Brain live his dream def take_over ( destination ) puts " Pinky , it 's time to take over the #{ destination } ! " end end
Let ’s give the new command a spin :
# Unfortunately Brain can't do much right now bash > boson take_over farm
Pinky , it 's time to take over the farm ! #
Of course we now have a brain library bash > boson libraries +----------+----------+------+--------------+
| name | commands | gems | library_type |
+----------+----------+------+--------------+ | core | 6 | | module | | web_core | 3 | | module | | brain | 1 | | file |
+----------+----------+------+--------------+
3 rows in set #
And a take_over command bash > boson commands take +-----------+-------+-------+---------------+---------------------------+
| full_name | lib | alias | usage | description |
+-----------+-------+-------+---------------+---------------------------+
| take_over | brain | | [ destination ] | Help Brain live his dream |
+-----------+-------+-------+---------------+---------------------------+
1 row in set #
And of course you can execute this all from irb ...
As you can see , Boson lets you write your libraries and commands in plain ruby .
Module - method DSLs be damned .
If you want more commands for the brain library , add more methods to Brain in the file .
Also notice that Boson automatically generates a command ’s usage and description from the method ’s arguments and the comment above it .
So that ’s cool .
Boson ’s libraries are just modules and its commands just methods .
But if this is all the functionality Boson offers , why bother with it at all ?
Borrowing from Thor , Boson commands can have simple yet powerful options .
Let ’s add some to take_over ( ) :
module Brain options : execute => : boolean , : countdown => : numeric # Help Brain live his dream def take_over ( destination , options = { } ) puts " Pinky , it 's time to take over the #{ destination } ! " sleep ( options [ : countdown ] ) if options [ : countdown ] system ( " /home/ brain / take_over / # { destination } " ) if options [ : execute ] end end
Brain always has the best of intentions :
bash > boson take_over world -- execute -- countdown=3
Pinky , it 's time to take over the world !
# program sleeps 3 seconds # executes `/home / brain / take_over / world` #
Thanks to auto - generated option aliases bash > boson take_over world -e - c3 # same as above ... # Boson still holds true to its irb duality bash > irb >> take_over ' world -e - c3 ' # same as above ... #
And if you want , call your command in plain ruby >> take_over ' world ' , : execute= > true , : countdown=>3
A few points :
options ( ) takes a hash of options with names mapping to option types
takes a hash of options with names mapping to option types
Short flags or option aliases are automatically generated based on the first letter of the option name .
Options have plenty of functionality .
Commands with options must expect their last argument to be an options hash .
So it ’s great that options can be defined concisely , but whatever happened to just writing commands in plain ruby ?
Well , Boson actually lets you but it ’s gonna cost you 2 more characters :
module Brain #@options : execute= >: boolean , :countdown= >: numeric # Help Brain live his dream def take_over ( destination , options = { } ) # .... end
DSL
As you can see , I commented out themethod and prepended ‘ options ’ with ‘ @ ’ .
This command still has the same functionality while still keeping it all in plain ruby .
Built with the power user in mind , Boson encourages aliasing of commands , options and even option values .
Let ’s take a look at each .
Aliasing commands is done through Boson ’s main config file at ~/.boson/config/boson.yml .
For an example config file , see mine .
Let ’s add command aliases for the default command commands and our example command take_over :
# Drop this in ~/.boson/config/boson.yml : command_aliases : commands : com take_over : take # Back in the shell #
List commands with ' com ' or ' take in its name : bash > boson - l=brain com com\|take +-----------+-------+-------+------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+
| full_name | lib | alias | usage | description |
+-----------+-------+-------+------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+ | commands | core | com | [ query = '' ] [ -- index ] [--query_fields=full_name ] |
List or search commands | | take_over | brain | take | [ destination ] |
Help Brain live the dream |
+-----------+-------+-------+------------------------------------------------+---------------------------+
2 rows in set #
And if we wanted to execute take_over with the new alias bash > boson take world -e -c3
As explained above , options automatically have aliases generated for them .
But if you want , specify your own aliases in options ( ) :
# Let 's add some aliases to the execute option module Brain #@options [ : execute , : conquer , :x ]=>: boolean , :countdown= >: numeric # ... end #
The execute option can now be called with -x and -- conquer
Aliasing option values is possible for option types : string and : array .
But unlike the other aliases , you specify a unique string that a value starts with rather than define explicit aliases .
Let ’s redo take_over ( ) to take a : string option with some expected values :
module Brain #@options : destination= >{ : type= >: string , : values= >%w{world farm fjord}} , # : execute= >: boolean , :countdown= >:numeric # Help Brain live his dream def take_over ( options = { } ) puts " Pinky , it 's time to take over the #{ options [ : destination ] } ! " sleep ( options [ : countdown ] ) if options [ : countdown ] system ( " /home/ brain / take_over / # { options [ : destination ] } " ) if options [ : execute ] end end
As you can see we added a : destination option with a : values attribute .
With this attribute , the : destination option is able to instantly alias those values .
For more about the :values attribute see here .
Let ’s see this aliasing in action :
# 'f ' will match ' farm ' over ' fjord ' since values are searched alphabetically bash > boson take - d=f Pinky , it 's time to take over the farm ! #
It 's still easy to get fjord bash > boson take - d=fj Pinky , it 's time to take over the fjord !
#
This is what Brain really wants to do bash > boson take - d=w -e Pinky , it 's time to take over the world ! #
If at any time you need to remember your option 's values bash > boson - hv take Loaded library core Loaded library web_core Loaded library brain take [ -- execute ] [-- destination=DESTINATION ] [-- countdown=N ] COMMAND OPTIONS
+---------------+-------+---------+------------------+ |
Option | Alias | type | Values | +---------------+-------+---------+------------------+
| -- countdown | -c | numeric | | | -- destination | -d | string | world , farm , fjord | | -- execute | -e | boolean | | +---------------+-------+---------+------------------+ # ...
You may be pleased to know that the default commands libraries and commands come with all this goodness :
bash > irb >> commands ' - hv' commands [ query = ' ' ] [ -- index ] COMMAND OPTIONS
+----------------+-------+---------+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+ |
Option | Alias | type | Description | Values | +----------------+-------+---------+----------------+------------------------------------------------------------------------+

Do n't worry about the other options .
To be covered in another blog post :p
So yes , you can search commands and libraries while choosing which fields to search , sort and display with aliased options and option values !
Boson makes it dead easy to install someone else ’s commands :

Now we have a list and description of commands that come with irb .
If you remember , Boson ’s libraries are just modules .
So any url that points to a ruby module now offers you a library of Boson commands .
You can even have the installer automatically wrap ruby code in a method and a module to make it a valid Boson library .
For example , take this gist for displaying authors on a git repository :
Let ’s commandify it :

To try some third - party Boson libraries , here are some of mine I recommend .
If you ’re familiar with rake and thor , you may be surprised that there has been no mention of namespaces .
That ’s because by default they ’re optional .
Boson , like Ruby , assumes you ’re grown up enough to balance power and peril .
To aid with keeping the default namespace clean , Boson does n’t load a library if it introduces a command which will conflict with existing commands .
This conflict detector will even catch third - party gems who pollute the default namespace by monkeypatching Kernel or Object .
You can turn off the conflict detector per library as needed .
If Boson ’s conflict detector is n’t comforting enough , no worries .
You can configure any library to have a namespace .
And if you yearn for namespacing by default , simply drop : auto_namespace : true into your ~/.boson/config/boson.yml .
Spinning Off
Although we ’ve covered most of Boson ’s basics , we still have n’t touched on how Boson integrates with Hirb .
That ’s for the next post .

UPDATE : The format for querying commands and libraries has changed since this was posted .
The above examples have been updated to reflect this .
Examples :
# With the old format fields to query were passed to -- query_fields bash > boson commands lib --query_fields=full_name -- sort=full_name # or commands lib - q=f - s=f #
With the new format , fields are placed before a query with a ' :' # -- query_fields does n't exist bash > boson commands full_name : lib -- sort=full_name # or commands f:lib - s=f #
The new format still maintains the old format of querying with an implicit query field .
#
The implicit field is ' name ' for libraries .
bash > boson libraries core # same as libraries name : core #
With the new format all fields can be queried using a '*' # Searches library fields : gems , dependencies , commands , loaded , module , name , namespace , indexed_namespace , library_type bash > boson libraries *: core #
The new format allows for multiple searches to be joined together by ' , ' #
This query searches for libraries that have the name matching core or a library_type matching gem bash > boson libraries name : core, library_type:gem
Both baking soda and baking powder are leavening agents , which means they are added to baked goods before cooking to produce carbon dioxide and cause them to rise .
Baking powder contains baking soda , but the two substances are used under different conditions .
Did You Know ?
You can substitute baking powder in place of baking soda ( you 'll need more baking powder and it may affect the taste ) , but you can't use baking soda when a recipe calls for baking powder .
Baking Soda
Baking soda is pure sodium bicarbonate .
When baking soda is combined with moisture and an acidic ingredient — such as yogurt , chocolate , buttermilk , or honey — the resulting chemical reaction produces bubbles of carbon dioxide that expand under oven temperatures , causing baked goods to expand or rise .
The reaction begins immediately upon mixing the ingredients , so you need to bake recipes that call for baking soda immediately , or else they will fall flat .
Baking Powder
Baking powder contains sodium bicarbonate , but it already includes the acidifying agent ( cream of tartar ) as well as a drying agent , usually starch .
Baking powder is available as a single - or double - acting powder .
Single - acting powders are activated by moisture , so you must bake recipes that include this product immediately after mixing .
Double - acting powders react in two phases and can stand for a while before baking .
With double - acting powder , some gas is released at room temperature when the powder is added to the dough , but the majority of the gas is released after the temperature of the dough increases in the oven .
How Are Recipes Determined ?
Some recipes call for baking soda , while others call for baking powder .
Which ingredient is used depends on the other ingredients in the recipe .
The ultimate goal is to produce a tasty product with a pleasing texture .
Baking soda is basic and will yield a bitter taste unless countered by the acidity of another ingredient , such as buttermilk .
You 'll find baking soda in cookie recipes .
Baking powder contains both an acid and a base and has an overall neutral effect in terms of taste .
Recipes that call for baking powder often call for other neutral - tasting ingredients , such as milk .
Baking powder is a common ingredient in cakes and biscuits .
Substituting in Recipes
You can substitute baking powder for baking soda ( you 'll need more baking powder and it may affect the taste ) , but you can't use baking soda when a recipe calls for baking powder .
Baking soda by itself lacks the acidity to make a cake rise .
However , you can make your own baking powder if you have baking soda and cream of tartar .
Simply mix two parts cream of tartar with one part baking soda .

For some time The Lede has been wondering what sort of person works at the Web site of Press TV , Iran ’s state - supported , English - language satellite channel .
After all , to judge by what ’s written on blogs and Twitter accounts by Web - savvy Iranians who speak English , that part of the country ’s population seems to skew quite heavily against the current government , which owns Press TV and clearly exerts an influence over its reports .
Two weeks ago , The Times of London discovered that until recently , the man running Press TV’s Web site was an American who fled the United States in 1980 after carrying out a political assassination in the Washington suburbs on behalf of the Iranian government .
The man , who now uses the name Hassan Abdulrahman , was formerly known as known as Dawud Salahuddin — which is the name he took at the age of 18 when he converted to Islam and first got involved with Islamist radical movements in the United States .
( Before that he was David Theodore Belfield , the son of a churchgoing Baptist family from Bay Shore , Long Island . )
Mr. Abdulrahman first worked on behalf of the Islamic Republic of Iran when it was little more than a year old .
In 1980 , he was a security guard at an Iranian diplomatic office in Washington when he accepted an assignment from the revolutionary government of Iran to assassinate a former member of the Shah ’s regime living in exile in Bethesda , Md .
At first , Mr. Abdulrahman told The New Yorker in 2002 , he tried to convince the Iranians to let him kill a more prominent American target .
He suggested either Henry Kissinger or Kermit Roosevelt — a grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt who had orchestrated the 1953 plot to depose Iran ’s prime minister , Mohammad Mossadegh , and return the Shah to power .
But his Iranian handlers were less concerned with striking a symbolic blow than with eliminating Ali Akbar Tabatabai , the exile who was holding meetings of a counter - revolutionary group at his home in Bethesda at the time .
Disguised as a mailman , Mr. Abdulrahman showed up at Mr. Tabatabai ’s front door on July 22 , 1980 , shot and killed him and then fled to Iran by way of Canada and Switzerland .
In the three decades since , he has compiled an extraordinary resume in Iran , working by turns as an English teacher , a war correspondent and a Web editor .
He also found time to fight alongside the Afghan mujahedeen in their war against the Soviets in the 1980s and act in a film by one of Iran ’s leading directors in 2000 .
Two years ago , when Robert Levinson , a former F.B.I. agent investigating cigarette smuggling in Iran , disappeared in mysterious circumstances , it emerged that he had been meeting with Mr. Abdulrahman just before he went missing .
This month , Mr. Abdulrahman told the Times of London that he had been Press TV ’s chief online editor for three years , but had resigned from the government - backed Web site two months ago .
He was also surprisingly frank about Press TV ’s approach to the news , saying :
No , I do n’t think Press TV is about [ real journalism ] .
By its nature , state journalism is not journalism .
They have some programs on there that might be , but generally it ’s not .
While Mr. Abdulrahman ’s work for Press TV , apparently since it was founded in 2007 , during President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad ’s first term , might seem like a tacit endorsement of the current government , his resignation and frank remarks could indicate that he is not happy with what the Islamic Republic he killed to defend has become .
Indeed Mr. Abdulrahman , who is married to an Iranian woman and lives in Karaj , outside Tehran , told The Times of London : “ I ’m living in a situation right now that ’s a little bit difficult . ”
Mr. Abdulrahman also seems to have ties to some of Iran ’s leading reformists .
In 2006 , the director of a Canadian documentary about his life in Iran , “ American Fugitive : The Truth About Hassan , ” explained in an interview with Maclean ’s that Mr. Abdulrahman “ was close to Vice President Mme . [ Massoumeh ] Ebtekar , ” who was a member of reformist president Mohammad Khatami ’s cabinet .
Ms. Ebtekar was Iran ’s first female vice president and has been outspoken in her dismay at the disputed presidential election on her English - language blog .
According to a report in The Tehran Times , she had planned to run for president herself this year , but decided to support Mir Hussein Moussavi to avoid splitting the reformist vote .
As a reminder that Iran ’s leading reformists are far from the Western lackeys their conservative opponents suggest , when Mr. Abdulrahman was acting as an assassin in Washington on behalf of the nascent Islamic Republic , Ms. Ebtekar was a spokeswoman for the hostage - takers at the United States Embassy in Tehran .
Mr. Abdulrahman has also been involved with another prominent reformist with a revolutionary past .
In 2001 , when Iranian director Mohsen Makhmalbaf ’s film about Afghanistan , “ Kandahar , ” was released to great acclaim in the United States , a relative of the man Mr. Abdulrahman killed in 1980 recognized him as one of the actors in it .
In the film , Mr. Abdulrahman played the part of an African - American convert to Islam working as a doctor in Afghanistan .
After Mr. Abdulrahman was recognized , an article in Time magazine headlined , “ A Killer in ‘ Kandahar ? ’ ” was featured in an Iranian newspaper .
In response , Mr. Makhmalbaf wrote an essay for The Guardian in which he said that he had no idea of Mr. Abdulrahman ’s past when he cast him in his film , but argued that the assassination had to be understood in context .
Mr. Makhmalbaf wrote in January 2002 :
He is accused of having killed a prominent member of the Shah ’s secret police — the Savak — in the US at the time of the Iranian revolution , and then of seeking asylum in Iran .
This was at a time when the entire Iranian nation was searching for members of Savak in order to destroy them for having been chiefly responsible for their misery , in much the same way as Americans are hunting members of Al Qaeda now . [… ]
In 1974 , when I was 17 , and was arrested and hospitalized for 14 days because of a gunshot , the Shah ’s secret police so brutally tortured me that I had to spend another 100 days in the police hospital .
I had to be operated on three times .
Now , 27 years later , I still have four huge scars from the torture , covering about 20 square centimeters of my body .
One of the people who tortured me lives in Los Angeles , I have heard , and two others live in Washington DC and have received political asylum from the U.S. [… ]
I am told that the 70 or 80 - year - old brother of Belfield ’s victim Tabatabai is now in the last season of his life , after revenge , and that some 20 years after the event he has come to search for the killer of his brother .
He does not understand that Belfield is also a victim — a victim of the ideal he believed in .
His humanity , when he opened fire against his ideological enemy , was martyred by his idealism .
Mr. Makhmalbaf was himself a teenage revolutionary but has recently been serving as an unofficial spokesman for Iran ’s opposition movement .
As The Lede mentioned last week , his daughter Hana just completed a film about the disputed election called “ Green Days . ”
While Mr. Abdulrahman told The New Yorker that he had killed but not murdered Mr. Tabatabai —
“ It was an act of war , ” he said in 2002 — his remarks about the assassination this month to The Times of London suggest that Mr. Makhmalbaf may have been right when he said that the act had killed something in him as well .
Mr. Abdulrahman told the British newspaper that there was nothing “ great , ” in what he ’d done , saying : “ What ’s great work about killing a man ?
It ’s pretty easy in the modern age .
You think it ’s great that the Americans have killed a million people in Iraq ?
Or that they are getting killed every day and killing hundreds of people in Afghanistan ? ”
What , he asked with an expletive , “ is great about that ? ”

HONG KONG  China unexpectedly increased pressure Sunday on the United States in a widening trade dispute , taking the first steps toward imposing tariffs on American exports of automotive products and chicken meat in retaliation for President Obama ’s decision late Friday to levy tariffs on tires from China .
The Chinese government ’s strong countermove followed a weekend of nationalistic vitriol against the United States on Chinese Web sites in response to the tire tariff .
“ The U.S. is shameless ! ” said one posting , while another called on the Chinese government to sell all of its huge holdings of Treasury bonds .
The impact of the dispute extends well beyond tires , chickens and cars .
Both governments are facing domestic pressure to take a tougher stand against the other on economic issues .
But the trade battle increases political tensions between the two nations even as they try to work together to revive the global economy and combat mutual security threats , like the nuclear ambitions of Iran and North Korea .
Mr. Obama ’s decision to impose a tariff of up to 35 percent on Chinese tires is a signal that he plans to deliver on his promise to labor unions that he would more strictly enforce trade laws , especially against China , which has become the world ’s factory while the United States has lost millions of manufacturing jobs .
The trade deficit with China was a record $ 268 billion in 2008 .

One of them is Hadaka Matsuri or well known as “ The Naked ” Festival .
The Hadaka Matsuri is about purifying the soul , but most people remember it because of what the men wear : Fundoshi , or traditional Japanese laincloths .
The event is particularly famous because there is one completely naked man hidden in and among a crowd of 10000 men .
Shinto tradition has it that the naked man absorbs all bad luck and evil deeds from the men who touch him .

Republican strategy is to paint
Net neutrality as government ‘ control ’ of Internet
Sen. John McCain ( R - AZ ) introduced a bill in the Senate on Thursday that would effectively allow Internet service providers to slow down or block Internet content or applications of their choosing .
The move came the same day as the federal government decided to move forward on an official Net neutrality policy that would prevent ISPs from making those types of decisions .
ADVERTISEMENT
The FCC ’s new rules would prevent ISPs , for example , from blocking or slowing bandwidth - hogging Web traffic such as streaming video or other applications that put a strain on their networks or from charging different rates to users .
McCain ’s bill , the Internet Freedom Act , would block the Federal Communications Commission from making Net neutrality the law of the land .
The rule preventing ISPs from slowing down certain types of content would create “ onerous federal regulation , ” McCain argued in a written statement .
According to a report at NetworkWorld , McCain “ called the proposed Net neutrality rules a ‘ government takeover ’ of the Internet that will stifle innovation and depress an ‘ already anemic ’ job market in the US . ”
But supporters of Net neutrality argue that the rule is needed to ensure that Internet providers do n’t censor content , or slow down traffic to Web sites that are in competition with their business allies .
FCC chairman Julius Genachowski argued that “ reasonable and enforceable rules of the road ” were needed “ to preserve a free and open Internet . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
“ The Internet ’s openness has allowed entrepreneurs and innovators , small and large , to create countless applications and services without having to seek permission from anyone , ” he said .
But , the FCC chairman said , there have been “ some significant situations where broadband providers have degraded the data streams of popular lawful services and blocked consumer access to lawful applications . ”
Two Republicans on the FCC also voted on Thursday to go ahead with the rule - making process , which will be open for public comment until January 14 , but voiced misgivings about the plan .

NET NEUTRALITY A ‘MARXIST PLOT ’?
As the NetworkWorld article notes , McCain was on the opposite side of the Net neutrality debate from President Barack Obama during last year ’s presidential campaign .
During his White House campaign , President Barack Obama came out strongly in favor of Net neutrality , which is backed by companies such as Google , Amazon , Yahoo ! , eBay and consumer advocacy groups , but opposed by telecommunications , wireless and cable companies .
ADVERTISEMENT
Republicans appear to be shifting against Net neutrality and aligning themselves with the telecoms and cable companies .
This week , media watchdog Media Matters criticized conservative news host Glenn Beck for what it said was Beck ’s allegation that Net neutrality is a “ Marxist plot , ” and that the point of Net neutrality is to “ control content , ” a perspective that prompted MediaMatters and other observers to question whether Beck understands the principle of Net neutrality .
In his announcement today , McCain appeared to agree with the notion that Net neutrality represents regulation and control , rather than a lack thereof .
ADVERTISEMENT
His bill “ will keep the Internet free from government control and regulation , ” McCain said , as quoted by Phil Goldstein at Fierce Wireless .
“ It will allow for continued innovation that will in turn create more high - paying jobs for the millions of Americans who are out of work or seeking new employment .

Are dud signals from a gravitational wave detector evidence that the universe is a holographic projection ?
( Image : ESA )
The GEO600 gravitational wave detector in Hanover , Germany , has not yet detected any gravitational waves .
As a consolation prize , it may instead have uncovered the ultimate nature of reality .
In 2008 , physicist Craig Hogan at the Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory in Batavia , Illinois , was trying to work out how we might test the idea that everything we see as physical reality is the result of a kind of projection from the boundary of the universe .
This is known as the holographic principle .
The information held at the boundary is not smooth , but composed of “ bits ” , each one occupying an area that corresponds to the most fundamental quanta of distance in the universe .
This is the Planck length , around 10 - 35 metres – far too small for us to see the individual bits .
When this information is projected into the volume of the universe , however , each bit gets magnified .
That means we might just be able to see pixellation in space - time .

The kinds of scales involved still mean it would only be detectable in the most sensitive instruments we have – such as the gravitational wave detectors looking for the ripples in space - time caused by violent cosmological events such as the collision of two black holes .
Hogan worked out how the pixellation might manifest itself for GEO600 and sent his result to the researchers there .
By strange coincidence , the GEO600 team had been having problems with “ noise ” in their detectors .
But here ’s the kicker : the noise had uncannily similar characteristics as Hogan ’s anticipated signal .
Is it indeed the result of information that resides at the edge of the universe ?
“ The issue is still unresolved , ” says Karsten Danzmann , principal investigator for GEO600 .
“ The noise is still there and we have no explanation . ”
The answer may only come after the instrument is upgraded to make it even more sensitive , a step that is due to be completed this time next year .

Today 's post is the last set of images from a weekly series of photographs from the e-waste capital of the world , Guiyu , in China 's Guangdong Province .
Read the full story here .
Kids in close proximity to e-waste .
This migrant worker family from Sichuan Province had no clue as to the health hazards of working in the e-waste business .
When my translator told them of the risks , the man sitting on the small red plastic stool , Chen Jiaxin , 29 , a father of three , replied : " We never knew that our kids could get cancer or other diseases by touching e-waste .
We always thought it was no problem if they just washed their hands afterwards ! "

Finally , here 's a story I wrote for the Hong Kong JMSC about the Lianjiang River that runs right through the middle of Guiyu ...
The Lianjiang – A Story Of A Chinese River
According to China 's Ministry of Environmental Protection , the Lianjiang River , which flows through the country ’s eastern Guangdong Province , is rated a ' Category 5 River ’ - the worst out of a total of 5 possible categories .
This means the water from it is neither fit for human consumption , nor for agricultural use .
Major sources of pollution along the river include domestic household waste and industrial pollution from textile factories .
But by far the biggest source of pollution along the Lianjiang River is from the processing of electronic waste , or ‘ e - waste ’ .
This takes place at the town of Guiyu on the Lianjiang ’s upper reaches .
Toxic solutions that contains high levels of dangerous chemicals derived from e-waste processing in Guiyu , seep directly into the Lianjiang River .
From Guiyu , the toxic chemicals continue their journey into the sea at the port of Haimen Bay .
Local fishermen there complain of dwindling catches and are losing their jobs , whilst fishing boats stay moored in the bay for weeks on end .
However , the spring water flowing from the source of the Lianjiang River is clean .
Coming straight out of Dananshan mountain , the water collected at the San Keng Shang reservoir , in Pu Ning County , appears clean and clear .
But just one pace from the clay hole in the side of the mountain , the spring water encounters its first piece of downstream man-made pollution , a discarded piece of polystyrene foam .
This common packaging material cannot biodegrade .
The problem is that polystyrene foam breaks down continuously into ever smaller and smaller pieces .
It eventually enters the food chain at the molecular level , with unknown side effects for animals and humans .
The spring water of the Lianjiang River at San Keng Shang has been dammed for the benefit of the local townsfolk .
Fishing is illegal at the reservoir , but they persist nonetheless .
The worst source of pollution along the Lianjiang River is undoubtedly to be found at Guiyu .
Situated on the upper reaches of the river , the town is at the centre of the world 's ' e - waste ' processing industry .
Illegal container loads of discarded electronic goods from the United States , Japan and Europe , find their way to China via the port of Hong Kong .
Most of it usually ends up in Guiyu for ' recycling ' at informal e-waste processing factories , of which there are around 3,000 in the town .
Computers , printers , keyboards , CRT monitors , mobile phones , and other obsolete high tech junk can be seen in large piles strewn across Guiyu .
Migrant workers from other Chinese provinces provide the labor .
Some work with sodium cyanide baths used to dissolve lead and precious metals , such as gold , silver and cadmium from computer integrated circuit boards .
This is by far the most poisonous and dangerous e-waste processing job of all , as most workers get sick from doing this job within a month .
The waste solution can contain lead , dioxins or polychlorinated biphenyls ( PCBs ) , and is usually discarded by pouring it into the soil .
It then leeches into the water table and the Lianjiang River itself , leaving it severely poisoned .
Metal that is encased in plastic in electronic devices such as printers is freed by uncontrolled open burning .
Wires are burnt to free the copper inside .
The acrid black smoke released from the fires is carcinogenic and can contain dangerous neurotoxins , dioxins and furans .
After the metals have been collected , the black burnt - out refuse from the fires is easily disposed of into the Lianjiang River .
There are no fish in the lifeless Lianjiang River .
The children can often be seen playing with toxic e-waste alongside their migrant worker parents .
All food and drinking water has to be imported into Guiyu from outside .
This results in much higher living costs for migrant workers , many of whom will later be faced with high medical bills .
According to Dr Lin Banghong , a doctor at the hospital in Guiyu who refused to be photographed , the incidence of cancer among e-waste workers in the town is high .
Dr Lin said , “ Although we can't conclusively be sure of the link between the pollution and the incidence of cancer here in Guiyu , we do strongly believe that the pollution is a factor affecting people ’s health here . ”
Dr Lin is also concerned that workers in the e-waste industry in Guiyu are falling ill from diseases hitherto unknown in China .
This is because much of the imported e-waste is smuggled into China and therefore not subject to China ’s stringent quarantine regulations .
Keyboards , for example , are notorious for harboring a large variety of different germs .
Education about the toxic side effects of e-waste handling is virtually unknown among the town ’s residents .
Mr. Chen Jiaxin , 29 , a local from Guiyu , runs a small e-waste family business .
He has three children .
When told about the possible side effects of the e-waste on his children , Mr. Chen said , " We never knew that our kids could get cancer or other diseases by touching e-waste .
We always thought it was no problem if they just washed their hands afterwards ! "
Further downstream , the industrial run-off from textile factories on the Lianjiang River is another significant source of pollution .
The middle reaches of the river are home to many polluting factories producing ladies underwear .
To conceal from sight their toxic effluent many factories bury their outflow pipes deep into the river .
The wanton disposal of household waste in the Lianjiang River is a problem too .
Many residents in the area are unaware that the throwing of household garbage into the river can pose a serious problem for the environment .
At Zhan Long , the Lianjiang River runs through a lock situated between its upper and lower reaches .
Chen Jinping , 37 , a migrant worker from Chongqing Municipality , spends twelve hours a day at the sluice gate fishing out errant plastic bags and other debris from the water inflow at the entrance to the lock ’s hydroelectric turbine .
She earns Euro 112 ( CNY 1,000 ) a month , working the twelve - hour shifts with her husband .
They rarely eat together .
She and husband and two small children live in a tiny room inside directly above the turbine , and she says that she worries for her children ’s health .
According to Ms Chen , “ The local people here are selfish .
They throw their trash into the river when no one is looking .
This river is like a sewer , and it ’s even worse on sunny days . ”
Near the lock is a plastics recycling facility .
Migrant workers from Sichuan Province sift through large bales of crushed plastic bottles from the United States ; Pepsi , Mountain Dew , Tropicana and Dasani mineral water , all the big soft drink names are there .
The plastic bottles are shredded into small pieces at the plant , ready to be melted down and recycled according to plastic type , of which there are many .
A baseball lies abandoned in the plastic chippings , thousands of miles away from it ’s original owner .
A cow sits forlornly among plastic chippings and discarded glass wool , by to it ’s source of water , a filthy tributary of the Lianjiang River .
Eventually the most polluted river in Guangdong Province flows into the sea at Haimen Bay .
By now the river is black , bubbling and viscous , clogged up with garbage and algae .
Fishermen here complain about the lack of fish in the bay , and about how they need to go further and further out to sea to catch fish .
It ’s unclear whether the lack of fish around Haimen Bay is as result of the pollution or over - fishing .
But it is evident that fishing has become uneconomical in Haimen Bay , with hundreds of boats lined up in the mouth of bay going nowhere .
Due to the excess in fishing capacity , catches are now too low to warrant the high cost of fuel required to go fishing .
Zheng Qingzhou , a fisherman in Haimen Bay started to notice the water quality of the Lianjiang River deteriorate about ten years ago .
Mr. Zheng said , “ Young people here no longer want to work in the fishing industry .
And some young fishermen here are finding it very hard to get a wife , since girls these days are n’t interested in men doing jobs with such low prospects . ”
No one knows for sure how many people have fallen ill or died as a consequence of the severe pollution of the Lianjiang River .
And no one knows for sure what the long - term effects will be on natural environment - the surrounding farmlands and the Pacific Ocean itself .

Carlos Kotkin
I once joined a singles dating website .
For legal reasons , I am not permitted to mention it by name .
It starts with an M and rhymes with " Snatch.com . "
Upon joining , I was asked to create a screenname for myself .
I came up with : ChickenWhisperer .
It was a challenge actually meeting someone through this site .
I wrote to about five or six … hundred women .
I ’d send messages such as " Hi , SexySoCalGirl26 , this is ChickenWhisperer .
We seem to have a lot in common .
I like to have fun and laugh all the time too !
Tell me about that dog in your picture , the dog wearing the sunglasses and baseball cap– –he looks like a real character ! "
Most of the women I wrote to ignored me .
But at last , a kind response arrived from BeachVixen78 .
She thanked me for writing and said she would love to meet up for a drink sometime .
We did , later that week .
( I had a lemonade . )
Her real name was Trinity .
She was an attractive woman with dark eyes , milky skin , and long brunette hair .
She asked how many women I had met through the website .
I told her she was my first .
She mentioned she met with pretty much every guy who wrote to her .
A few nights later , I took her to dinner at a fancy hotel on the beach in Santa Monica .
From where we sat , I could see the pier festively lit up .
I remarked that the pier looked nice .
With a coy smile , Trinity blushed , and responded , " Thank you . "
She thought I had said , " Your hair looks nice . "
For a moment , I considered clarifying my words , " No , no .
The pier . ”
I kept quiet though , allowing the accidental compliment to make me seem smoother than I actually am .
Three dates later , in her apartment , we had what is commonly referred to as sexual intercourse .
I ca n’t say I was falling in love with her––nor she with me––but certainly she was charismatic enough to get intimate with .
And intimate we got .
Not to be too graphic , but I did a little traveling , taking a lengthy trip downtown , if you know what I mean .
Her airport had a narrow , well - maintained landing strip wink wink .
Afterward , as we were laying in her bed , resting , I stared at her ceiling –– not a euphemism , I was actually staring at her ceiling ––and marveled at the power of the Internet .
That ’s when she snuggled closer to me , and whispered , " I have to tell you something … I have …
The H Word . "
The H Word .
Two H words immediately came to mind : HIV and herpes .
And so I suddenly found myself silently praying : Please , God .
Let it be herpes .
God , if you give me herpes , I will be the happiest man on Earth .
I will be Your servant , I will help fight childhood obesity , I ’ll donate my car to someone who has Restless Leg Syndrome , whatever …
I calmly turned to her and asked which H Word she was referring to .
She sighed heavily and stated , " I ’m only going to say this once , " followed by a dramatic pause .
Finally , she blurted out , " Herpes ! "
Then she squealed and hid under the sheets like a little kid , even though she was thirty - years - old .
As she remained burrowed beneath the sheets , I stared at her ceiling , and marveled at the power of the Internet .
For only $ 39.99 a month , I could catch herpes .
Trinity eventually came out from hiding and explained to me , as calmly as if she was doing my taxes , " I probably did n’t give it to you , but if I did , you ’ll find out within the next two weeks . "
I turned to her and responded , “ I probably wo n’t burn your house down , but if I do , you ’ll find out within the next two weeks . ”
Sensing I was upset , she quietly told me if I wanted to leave , she would understand .
She continued speaking , though I ca n’t be certain of what she said because I was in my car on my way home .
The next twenty - four hours I spent online , researching herpes .
I learned a lot of things .
For one , even though , yes , I had used protection , I was not out of the woods––as one of the main ingredients in transmitting herpes is simple skin on skin contact––no visible symptoms of herpes required .
As easy as getting into any community college !
And here was an added bonus I discovered through my research : it was entirely possible for her genital herpes to break out on my non-genital mouth .
What an exciting two weeks I had in store for me !
While I was on the computer , I received an email from Trinity .
It occurred to her she should apologize .
She said if I was no longer interested in a physical relationship , she hoped at the very least we could remain “ good friends . ”
She wanted to be friends because she really enjoyed my sense of humor , my easygoing personality , and my infectious smile .
I can forward you the email .
I politely wrote back , thanking her for the message , and letting her know I would have a difficult time considering her a “ good friend . ”
Because in my book , good friends give each other a ride to the airport .
Also , I recommended she change her screenname from BeachVixen78 to HerpesGirlSimplex2 .
It was n’t that she had herpes .
People get herpes , that ’s life .
Heck , maybe even I had it thanks to her !
It was how she decided to tell me that rubbed me the wrong way , so to speak .
The following two weeks , I was on Herpes Watch .
Every little itch , twitch , shiver , tick , tinge , twinge , tingle , bristle , shudder , flutter , and pinch made me nervous .
I would freeze and ask myself , what ’s that ?!
As fate would have it , those two weeks were spent in Washington D.C. , visiting my parents .
Every so often my mother would turn to me , and quizzically ask , “ Carlos , are you all right ?
You look a little stressed . ” I told her nothing .
A week after I got back from Washington D.C. , I saw my doctor , a Trekkie named Dr. Kovak , who has a life - sized cardboard cut - out of Mr. Spock in his office .
I told Dr. Kovak and Mr. Spock my story .
At the end of it , Dr. Kovak confessed , “ Since people are telling you things after it ’s too late , I should probably come clean and let you know I do n’t have my medical license .
But I ’m hoping for next year ! ”
Then he crossed his fingers and laughed uproariously .
But seriously , folks , he went on , “ I do have a license .
I was just joshing you . ”
He gave me a blood test for every STD under the sun––including herpes I , oral herpes .
Herpes I is not even really considered a true STD , most of the world population has it .
In fact , if you do n’t have it , you ’re kind of a loser .
And , of course , my testing included herpes II , the bad kind .
The results came back and it turns out , I would not write a story about the time I caught genital herpes .
I ’m happy to report I do n’t have any STDs at all .
Not only do I not have herpes II , I do n’t even have herpes I .
Which in all honesty , is a little disappointing .
I figured I ’ve made out with enough women to have caught that a long time ago .
Clearly , ChickenWhisperer needs to get out there more .
The Financial Times is in talks to introduce a " pay- per- article " system inspired by the Apple iTunes model , which could change the culture of reading news on the internet .
Senior sources at the FT have confirmed that the group is in discussions with a number of payment processor companies to establish a simple " one - lick " procedure that would enable consumers to pay a small fee for single articles that would otherwise be available only to subscribers .
FT executives , who hope to have the system in place by 2010 , have not settled on the price for an individual story , but say that they have been impressed by the " fabulous buying experience " of iTunes , which allows users to buy a single song for 79 p .

The development follows the announcement this week by Rupert Murdoch that he will introduce charging to all his news websites , including those for The Times , The Sunday Times , The Sun and the News of the World , by next summer .
" Quality journalism is not cheap , " he declared in New York after announcing a huge fall in profits in his global newspaper division .
" The digital revolution has opened many new and inexpensive distribution channels but it has not made content free .
We intend to charge for all our news websites . "
John Ridding , the chief executive of the Financial Times , told The Independent : " Our view is that there 's significant potential for pricing per piece and per time period .
The whole point about the internet is flexible consumption and reader choice . "
The FT already has 117,000 subscribers , paying at least £ 155.48 for a year 's access .
Mr Ridding believes that adopting a pay - per-article model would encourage some of the site 's 1.3 million users who have registered to read up to 10 free articles each month to start paying for access to additional pieces without having to subscribe .
" There is tremendous potential there .
It needs to be frictionless , people do n't have a lot of time and do n't want to go through a laborious transaction process for one article [ but ]
I think there 's potential there for monetising a whole new layer of traffic and readers . "
Rob Grimshaw , the managing director of FT.com , said that Apple 's impact on the music download culture was inspiring for news publishers : " iTunes is a great one to talk about because fundamentally they have created a fabulous buying experience .
I'm a great believer that people do n't object to buying things online ... they do object to hassle .
If you create an experience that 's so quick and easy it involves pressing one button , you will find a lot of people are happy to do it . "
Media companies needed to pay closer attention to how other industries had used the internet , to offer consumers flexible and attractive payment models .
" The obvious example is the way the airlines use the internet , " Mr Grimshaw said .
" If you buy in advance or travel during the day , they give you a cheaper price .
They have managed to have two people on the same flight to the same destination and one has paid £ 10 and the other £ 150 but both thought it was a fair price because they both bought it .
Media companies as a whole and publishers in particular are miles away from that in terms of their pricing . "

Almost all mainstream British news providers have made their content available free on the internet but advertising revenues have failed to meet expectations .
It emerged on Sunday that the Guardian Media Group ( GMG ) is considering closing The Observer , the world 's oldest Sunday newspaper , after the group suffered annual losses of £ 90 m .
It has invested heavily in The Guardian website , hoping to make it the world 's leading online liberal news brand .
The FT and Mr Murdoch 's Wall Street Journal , which also has a subscription model , have persuaded readers to pay for specialist financial information and there is growing confidence within the industry that consumers will be willing to spend on other news forms .
Mr Murdoch suggested that the celebrity content of papers such as The Sun and News of the World could be monetised online .
" When we have a celebrity scoop , the number of hits we get now are astronomical , " he said .
Bob Satchwell , the chairman of the Society of Editors , said that the " jury is still out " on whether a sufficient number of online readers would be prepared to pay for general news .
" You might find specialist markets in celebrity and maybe in sport and some of the other areas where UK papers have developed a huge expertise in developing the kind of content the UK public wants , " he said .
" Rupert Murdoch generally does n't get things wrong .
He was the one who led most of the papers belatedly on to the internet and that has worked in terms of the number of eyeballs now looking at these sites . "
Mr Grimshaw said publishers had misunderstood the internet : " The demand for information is larger than it has ever been but for some reason the publishing industry as a whole decided it might be a good idea if they all gave away their primary product .
It does not strike me as being a smart decision .
There seems to be this belief abroad that the whole mechanics of human nature and economics have changed utterly on the internet and I simply do n't believe that 's the case .
If you need a piece of information or an article and the only way you can get to it is to pay for it , then people will pay .
" Although mass - market newspaper publishers are struggling with this , others , such as scientific journals and specialist vertical titles have been charging for their content online since day one and as a consequence have robust businesses . "
The saviour of newspapers ?
Why paying for news online is vital for media companies
Q. Why is it so important ?
A. Despite the fast growth in use of newspaper websites ( the Daily Mail 's Mail Online site is currently the most popular with 29.4 million unique monthly users ) , the anticipated surge in advertising revenue has not materialised , with online adverts often earning as little as 12 per cent of those in print .
Q. Who decided that online news should be free ?
A . The culture spread from America , where the newspaper industry is even more beleaguered than in Britain and grave doubts exist over the future of famous titles such as the Los Angeles Times and the Boston Globe .
Q . Have they had a change of heart ?
A. Murdoch and others in America , including David Simon , the writer of the hit television series The Wire , are leading the debate for paid - for content .
But many internet users criticise their position .
The New York Times recently asked subscribers to its paper whether they would pay between $ 2.50 and $ 5 for access to the newspaper 's online archive .
Q. Where does the BBC fit in ?
A. As Bob Satchwell , chairman of the Society of Editors , noted yesterday , the BBC , with its well - resourced and free website , represents a major challenge to newspaper sites if they are to attempt to charge British users for content .
Q. Is it not too late to change an entrenched culture ?
A. British newspapers produce specialist content that goes far beyond even what the BBC has to offer and the experience of iTunes and other legal music download services has shown a proportion of internet users will pay for content , even if it can be found for free elsewhere .
Bernard Madoff says he thought it was " game over " for his multi-billion dollar fraud in 2006 , after he was cornered into handing over details of the empty bank account where he claimed to be holding his investors ' money .
But investigators at Wall Street 's main watchdog never even looked in the account , and Madoff says he was " astonished " to have remained a free man for another two and a half years .
A searing internal report from Wall Street 's top regulator , the Securities and Exchange Commission , says that the 2006 failure was just one in a catastrophic series of errors that the agency made in its dealings with Madoff .
It could have discovered the fraud and shut him down as early as 1992 , but staff were dazzled by his Wall Street credentials and fearful of his power , the report concludes .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
At one point Madoff even claimed to be on a short - list to become the next chairman of the SEC .
Over 16 years , the agency received six tip - offs , conducted three examinations and two full investigations , and yet still managed to miss the fact that Madoff had never once made an investment with his clients ' money .
Cash from new investors was simply going to pay off old ones , and thousands of people who believed their life savings were safe with Madoff were left with nothing when the scheme finally collapsed last December .
In the May 2006 investigation , Madoff testified to SEC staff for several hours , gave evasive and contradictory answers and asked them to accept that his impossibly successful investment returns were the result of his " gut feel " for the stock market .
But it was when they asked for details of the trading account where he claimed to house his clients ' investments that he believed they had finally found the key to a fraud that had been getting bigger and bigger for at least 15 years .
" I thought it was the end game , over , " Madoff told the SEC 's inspector - general .
" Monday morning they 'll call and this will be over ... and it never happened . "
He " was astonished " , he said .
The inspector general has been investigating how the SEC failed to spot the world 's largest - ever pyramid scheme , despite repeated warnings from anonymous sources , industry experts and a private investigator who waged a years - long battle to convince them that Madoff 's purported trading strategy was impossible .
When the SEC did examine Madoff , they concentrated on rumours he was front - running – a stockbroking scam which profits from knowledge of client trading – and failed to follow up clues to a much bigger fraud .
In a particularly damaging section of the report , released in summary yesterday , the inspector - general says that the SEC 's repeated investigations actually made it easier for Madoff to pursue his crimes .
If investors expressed any scepticism about his returns , he told them that the SEC had checked him over .
Madoff was once one of the most powerful men in finance , a former chairman of the Nasdaq stock exchange , whose business had helped introduce revolutionary electronic trading to Wall Street .
The SEC , by contrast , put only junior staff on his case , and he was easily able to manipulate them .
" All throughout the examination , Bernard Madoff would drop the names of high - up people in the SEC , " one junior examiner said .
One senior staff member warned more junior SEC staff to remember that Madoff was " a very well - connected , powerful person " .

When the SEC did go to look at the books at the Madoff offices in Midtown Manhattan , he would try to keep members of his staff from talking to the inspectors .
When they sought documents Madoff did not wish to provide , he became very angry .
One examiner said " veins were popping out of his neck ... his voice level got increasingly loud " and he was repeatedly saying : " What are you looking for ?
Front running .
Are n't you looking for front running ? "
The SEC had a chance to nip Madoff 's fraud in the bud in 1992 , when it investigated and shut down a fund management firm that promised implausible " 100 per cent " safe investments .
The firm was handing all its clients ' money to Madoff to invest , but the SEC failed to examine what promises Madoff had been making to the firm .
It was only the market turmoil of last year that finally brought Madoff down , and the full details of his crimes are still not known , despite his guilty plea and his sentencing in June to 150 years in prison .
It remains unclear when the fraud began , and how many other people at his firm were involved .
Madoff cooperated with the SEC 's inspector - general in the investigation of the regulator 's failings , but he has not been cooperating with criminal prosecutors .
The inspector - general 's report will be published in full in the next few days .
Although it excoriates the SEC for incompetence , it does exonerate staff members of having inappropriate financial or personal ties to Madoff .
A romantic relationship between Shana Madoff , the fraudster 's niece , and an SEC official did not influence the conduct of the SEC 's investigations , it says .
Mary Schapiro , who took over as chairman of the SEC in January , said there was no hiding from the fact that the agency missed numerous opportunities to discover the fraud .
" It is a failure that we continue to regret , and one that has led us to reform in many ways how we regulate markets and protect investors . "
Like any Harvard University educated lawyer running for public office , Chris Kelly – who prior to his Facebook gig worked in the Clinton administration - was harder to ideologically nail down than either Salley or Hammer .
While Kelly acknowledged that his one - year old was obsessed with playing with his iPhone ( presumably not an entirely healthy preoccupation for a human being this new to the world ) , he did argue that children should never confuse Facebook with real life .
And so the consummate lawyer Kelly cleverly circumvented the F word question by arguing – a little disingenuously in my opinion - that since social media websites like Facebook aggressively distinguishes between real world and online community , the impact of these networks is actually minimal on children .
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A former U.S. government scientist who served in sensitive positions on classified aerospace projects has been arrested and charged with trying to deliver classified information to someone he thought was an Israeli intelligence official .
Stewart David Nozette of Chevy Chase , Maryland , was taken into custody Monday by FBI agents .
Stewart David Nozette of Chevy Chase , Maryland , was taken into custody Monday afternoon at the Mayflower Hotel by FBI counterespionage agents , and was expected to appear in a federal courtroom in Washington on Tuesday .
The criminal complaint does not accuse the government of Israel of any violations of U.S. law .
In an 18 - page affidavit , the FBI sets out the case against Nozette , 52 , who received a doctorate in planetary sciences from Massachusetts Institute of Technology .
The FBI document , signed by Special Agent Leslie G. Martell , says Nozette in January 2009 told a colleague " that if the United States government tried to put him in jail " on an unrelated matter , Nozette would move to Israel or another unidentified foreign country and " tell them everything " he knows .
Nozette had a " top secret " clearance , and served at the White House on the National Space Council for President George H.W. Bush , the affidavit says .
Later , from early 2000 to early 2006 , he did research and development for the Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency , the Naval Research Laboratory , and NASA 's Goddard Space Flight Center , it says .
The document says Nozette also acted as a technical consultant from 1998 until early 2008 " for an aerospace company that was wholly owned by the government of the state of Israel . "
The company consulted with Nozette monthly , getting answers to questions , and he received total payments of $ 225,000 , Martell 's affidavit says .
In early September , Nozette was contacted by phone by an individual purporting to be an Israeli intelligence officer , but who really was an FBI undercover agent , the document says .
They met in downtown Washington in front of a hotel , and over lunch , Nozette " demonstrated his willingness to work for Israeli intelligence , " it says .
The undercover agent engaged in a series of meetings with Nozette , and eventually Nozette allegedly provided " secret " information in a " dead drop " post office box .
Some of the information , the affidavit says , was classified as secret .
Nozette will make an initial appearance at 1:45 p.m. Tuesday before a federal magistrate judge in Washington .
If he is convicted , he could face up to a life sentence , officials said .

Interview outtakes from THE WAR :
" Our company commander like all other company commanders of the regiment called his officers together And he says , ' The war is ending .
The Germans are giving up .
They 're now sending messages to negotiate .
So it 's obvious the war is over .
But we can not let down the pressure .
Because if we do n't , the war will be prolonged .
We have to end it as soon as possible .
So , keep it up . '
And that 's a horrible thing .
Knowing that the war is going to end and you have to keep urging your men to go forward .
And it was with that as a background , we had this objective , a high mountain .
And we proceeded and as I was going up , I suddenly felt someone punching me on the side .
That 's what I thought it was .
I fell down and I got up and kept on moving .
There was no pain , just a little ache there until my messenger who is right in back of me with that walkie - talkie .
He says , ' You 're bleeding . '
I says , ' I 'm bleeding ? '
So he says , ' Feel your back . '
I had a bullet going right through my abdomen .
Came out just about a quarter inch from my spine .
And so help me , I did n't feel any pain , just like somebody has punched me .
So I said , ' Let 's keep on going . '
So we kept on going up and then machine gun fire started pouring in .
Obviously there were machine gun nests up there .
And from where I was , I could see two of them .
So I told the men , ' Stay down . '
I always carried a bag of grenades .
That was my major weapon .
And luckily , I moved up to the first one and I threw in a grenade and boom .
They were silenced .
And as I was proceeding to the second one , this German stood up with a rifle grenade and as I was getting ready to throw my grenade , he hit my elbow .
And the only thing I can remember after that is that I was looking around for the grenade because I felt it , fell out of my hand .
I found it clutched in my fingers , so I peeled it off and I threw it .
It worked .
But after that , everything is blank .
And what the men told me I did , I said , ' No , it ca n't be . '
According to my men and according to the company commander , he says , ' You , for a moment , you went berserk .
You picked up your gun , ' I had a Thompson sub - machine gun and with my left hand started approaching the last machine nest , just firing it with the blood splattering out and it was a horrible sight , I think .
And finally , I got hit again on my leg and I kept rolling down the hill and that was the end . "
As a schoolteacher , Amy Yale is surrounded by the primary transmitters of swine flu , but she still does n’t want anything to do with the highly sought H1N1 vaccine .
Her friend , Theresa Loya , has a son with asthma whose pediatrician implored her to get him vaccinated — but she , too , has refused doctor ’s orders .
Even though most health experts vouch for the safety of the H1N1 vaccine that is slowly being distributed this month , and many people have placed their names on waiting lists to get it , there ’s a wide range of skeptics who worry the vaccine is untested , fear the potential side effects or are , quite simply , apathetic .
“ There ’s so many chemicals in all these shots we do n’t know about .
The doctors just say you need it , ” said Loya , a Santa Clara real estate agent and mother of six .
“ I do n’t think you should take any flu shot that just came out , ” chimed in Yale , who was having coffee with Loya in Santa Clara on Thursday morning .
“ I think we ’re a society that overmedicates .
People sneeze and get an antibiotic . ”
A CNN poll conducted last weekend found that nearly half of those surveyed believe the H1N1 vaccine is safe , however 43 percent of those polled believe the “ vaccine has side effects that can lead to death or serious health problems . ”
In a Field Poll study completed early this month , 72 percent of those surveyed said they would get vaccinated if doctors recommended it , but 27 percent said they would not .
“ I think there ’s a lot of mistrust in general for vaccines , ” said Dr. Yvonne Maldonado , chief of infectious diseases at Lucile Packard Children ’s Hospital at Stanford .
“ Why take a healthy young child and give them something that might cause a side effect ?
I understand .
But it ’s very clear that if we did n’t vaccinate even a small proportion of all the children , then within a few years we would see all of these diseases return . ”
While vaccines have just about wiped out polio , tetanus , measles and mumps and scores of other debilitating diseases , she said , within the last several years , cases of measles popped up in San Diego and Arizona and mumps in the Midwest when a growing number of parents did n’t vaccinate their children .
Maldonado said she is confident that both the seasonal and H1N1 vaccines are safe .
At Packard Children ’s Hospital , she is in the midst of studying the side effects of the swine flu vaccine on 130 adults from the age of 18 to 65 .
( Other hospitals are studying other age groups . )
So far , she said , after studying daily reports , “ we have not seen any unexpected side effects , ” she said .
She has seen the usual side effects , including redness or swelling around the injection site , and an occasional mild fever or nausea .
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention says high - risk groups — pregnant women , health - care workers , children from 6 months to 4 years of age , and all children with chronic health conditions — should be the first to receive the H1N1 vaccine .
The risk for infection among people 65 or older appears to be less than with other age groups , studies show , probably because they were exposed to similar strains in the 1940s and ’50s .
People allergic to eggs should not get the vaccine .
But still , health officials did n’t engender much confidence last spring when they closed schools and canceled community events when the H1N1 virus first broke out in the U.S.
The CDC reports that one in five U.S. children have had flulike symptoms this month , but the virus has turned out to be relatively mild compared with the global killer pandemic that had been feared .
And popular conservative talk show host Glenn Beck stirred up concerns when he highlighted how hundreds of Americans who were vaccinated during a now infamous swine flu scare in 1976 developed a serious neurological disorder called Guillain - Barre ﻿ Syndrome .
“ You do n’t know if this ( the H1N1 vaccine ) is going to cause neurological damage like it did in the 1970s , ” he told his listeners .
The risks , however , were considered small , with an additional 1 case per 100,000 people vaccinated in 1976 ; the CDC estimates those risks at one case in 1 million this year .
Still , Loya said she and her husband were swayed by a YouTube video titled “ Cheerleader Gets a Swine Flu Shot & Now She Can Only Walk Backwards ! ”
( The narrator on the video claimed it was the seasonal flu shot that caused her problems and there was no evidence presented that the vaccine was responsible for the girl ’s rare neurological ailment . )
All are stoking fears and uncertainties .
Loya , who wo n’t vaccinate her children , said she has purchased expensive homeopathic tablets she hopes will ward off the virus .
Her friend , Yale , is keeping her hands washed .
But Philip Sousa , a 26 - year - old Santa Clara Law School student , is n’t paying much attention to any of it .
Despite all the e-mails from campus administrators urging him to get inoculated , and signs around campus to wash his hands , “ I figure I ’m healthy and if I get swine flu , I ’ll just be sick like the regular flu .
It does n’t scare me that much . ”

WASHINGTON ( AP ) 
The government on Wednesday awarded $ 5 billion in grants that President Obama said would pay for research into cures for cancer and other diseases and create tens of thousands of jobs .
Obama made the announcement at the National Institutes of Health campus in Bethesda , Md. , with Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius .
Before making remarks about the grants , Obama and Sebelius toured an NIH oncology laboratory .
" That 's a pretty spiffy microscope , " Obama remarked as he walked through the lab .
Researchers allowed the president to take a look at the brain cells they 're studying , explaining the difference between healthy cells and cancerous cells .
In a White House statement , Obama said the money was designed " to fund cutting - edge medical research in every state across America . "
The money comes from the $ 787 billion economic stimulus program that is designed to help create jobs and turn around the economy .
The program included $ 10 billion for the NIH .
Obama said the grants would create " tens of thousands of jobs conducting research , manufacturing and supplying medical equipment , and building and modernizing laboratories and research facilities . "
Jared Bernstein , who is Vice President Biden 's chief economist , said the $ 5 billion will support about 12,000 existing projects and create thousands of jobs over the next two years for researchers and educators , as well as medical equipment makers and suppliers .
The White House statement said the money would fund " several areas including heart disease , autism , HIV - AIDS , H1N1 Flu and cancer . "
The investment includes $ 175 million for The Cancer Genome Atlas ( TCGA ) to collect more than 20,000 tissue samples from more than 20 cancers and determine in detail all of the genetic changes in thousands of these tumor samples .
" We are about to see a quantum leap in our understanding of cancer , " said NIH Director Francis Collins .
The cancer study involves more than 150 scientists at dozens of institutions around the country , the White House statement said .

Story Game
Give each student a piece of blank of paper .
Students must write the name of a man or male group at the top of the paper .
Then , students fold the top of the paper so that the name can't be seen , and pass the paper to the next student .
Next , students write a girl 's name on the paper they just received from the previous student .
They fold the paper again so the girl 's name can't be seen , and pass the paper to the next student .
The students then write where the man and woman meet , what the man says , what the woman says , and what happens next .
After each new piece of information , they fold the paper to hide their response and pass it to the next student .
Once they have written what happens next ( the last piece of information ) , students can look at the whole paper , and read their story .
For example :
MAN ( meets )
------( fold )------
WOMAN ( at )
------( fold )------
PLACE .
------( fold )------
HE SAYS : ( " Student 's idea " )
------( fold )------
SHE SAYS :( " Student 's idea " )
------( fold )------
WHAT DO THEY DO NEXT ?
( Student 's idea )
Encourage students to write in whole sentences , and if they can't read it out well to the class , help them .
Most stories will be inevitably funny for the students .

McFadden used threats to keep his young victims quiet A former police officer who claimed he was a " black magic " high priest while sexually abusing three children has been jailed for seven years .
John McFadden , 42 , from Bearsden , was found guilty of abusing a boy between 1988 and 1992 in Kirkintilloch .
He was also convicted of abusing two other youngsters at various addresses in Kirkintilloch between 1983 and 1990 .
At the High Court in Glasgow , judge Lord Matthews also placed McFadden on the sex offenders register .
The court heard how McFadden had been running a martial arts club when he began abusing a 12 - year - old boy who had joined .
He befriended the boy , invited him to stay overnight and told him that demons and spirits would kill him and drag him to hell unless he carried out sex acts .
He dressed in a black cloak and used a crucifix with a skull and crossbones and an onyx ring , which he claimed gave him power , to terrify the youngster into keeping the abuse a secret .
The victim , who is now 32 , told how McFadden abused him almost every day for four years , using threats to keep him silent .
This was a fairly monstrous breach of trust .
You ran a martial arts club and were well regarded
Lord Matthews
The victim said : " He started to get us into this black magic .
He described himself as a high priest with this black magic circle .
" He said he could have out of body experiences and could talk to demons and spirits .
" One day he said he was going to initiate me into the circle and this became the main driver for my silence .
" He had a cast iron bowl and he pricked my finger and put some blood in it , then he took some of my hair and said that he had to have some of my semen and then it all had to be burned . "
The abuse came to an end when the man joined the Royal Marines and moved away .
Devil mask
The court was also told that another man came forward in 1999 to complain that he had been indecently assaulted by McFadden at the age of seven .
McFadden resigned from the police that year but was not convicted at that time .
He was finally charged several years later after two others came forward to report similar incidents .
When police searched McFadden 's home they found a devil mask and two wands alongside sex toys and lubricants .
He tried to claim that his victims were making up the abuse but a jury refused to believe him .
Passing sentence , Lord Matthews told McFadden : " This was a fairly monstrous breach of trust .
You ran a martial arts club and were well regarded .
" You effectively took people off the street and taught them how to defend themselves , but then abused that trust . "

How to make Bismuth crystals
Bismuth Crystals
Bismuth ( element # 83 on the periodic table ) forms beautifully colored and geometrically intricate hopper crystals , shown in the image to the left , as it slowly cools and solidifies from its molten state .
The distinctive , ' hoppered ' , shape of a Bismuth crystal results from a higher growth rate around its outer edges than on its inside face .
The higher rate of growth on the edges forms a crystal which appears to be partially hollowed out in a rectangular - spiral stair step design .
The crystal 's eye - catching array of colors results from the formation of a thin oxide layer on its surface .
The colors on Bismuth crystals arise in a similar fashion to those on a soap bubble or thin film of oil on water in which light reflecting off the top and bottom of the film produce interference maxima of a particular color depending on the film ’s thickness .
A thin layer of Bismuth Oxide on the otherwise pure Bismuth crystal causes light of certain wavelengths to interfere constructively upon reflection giving rise to the color seen on the surface .
Due to variations in the thickness of the oxide layer , the crystal is not one solid color but rather is a rainbow of colors corresponding to the wavelengths ( and colors ) of light which interfere constructively at each location .
For a more thorough explanation of this phenomenon research the topic of thin film interference .
Growing Bismuth Crystals
In order to grow high quality crystals , very pure Bismuth metal must be used .
A purity of 99.99 % Bismuth , or better , is preferred for growing high quality crystals .
Another important factor which affects the quality and size of Bismuth crystals is the cooling time .
Larger crystals may be produced by allowing the Bismuth to cool and solidify slowly from its molten state .
The melting point of Bismuth is relatively low compared to other metals at only 271 °C ( 520 °F ) , which is low enough to easily melt using a small propane torch or even a laboratory hot plate .
Do not forget , however , that you are still dealing with very hot molten metal , which can flow and splatter just like any liquid and can cause painful burns .
Depending on the volume of Bismuth used , a variety of containers are suitable to hold the Bismuth while it melts .
A small to medium sized , steel , measuring cup has been show to work well for preparing Bismuth crystals .
Step 1 : Melting the Bismuth
Steel cup containing molten Bismuth
Place pieces of Bismuth into a steel measuring cup and melt on a hot plate at high heat .
As the Bismuth melts , the exposed surface of the liquid will oxidize readily due to the high temperature and presence of Oxygen in the ambient air resulting in the formation of a gray ‘ skin ’ on the top surface ; this is normal .
Step 2 : Pouring the molten Bismuth
Molten Bismuth with a thick layer
of oxidation on it before pouring
After the Bismuth has melted , slowly and carefully pour the liquid Bismuth into another clean , preheated , steel measuring cup .
By transferring the Bismuth into a new container one can remove the thick skin of oxide which has formed on the surface of the Bismuth that can negatively affect crystal growth .
One can slowly pour out the clean , silvery , liquid Bismuth from underneath the gray oxide layer which remains behind in the original container .
Step 3 : Allowing the Bismuth to cool
Bismuth immediately before the first
pour to remove oxidization layer
Set the Bismuth , in its new container , on a well - insulated and heat resistant surface to cool and begin to solidify .
Placing the Bismuth back onto the hot plate ( with the power turned off ) will allow the Bismuth to cool very slowly as it returns to room temperature .
Not long after pouring the Bismuth into its new container will a new oxide layer become visible .
The new oxide layer will not be as thick as the previous layer .
As the new oxide layer growths thicker it will gradually change color as different wavelengths of light constructively interfere after reflecting off its surface ( for the same reason why the Bismuth crystals themselves are colored ) .
Step 4 : Pouring out extra Bismuth
Immediately after pouring off excess
liquid Bismuth .
Newly formed crystals
exposed .
Before the Bismuth fully solidifies , pour out the excess liquid Bismuth into another container .
Do not allow the Bismuth to fully solidify ; if one does not pour out the excess liquid in time the crystals will become trapped inside the resulting metal lump .
The crystals will form and grow progressively larger as the Bismuth freezes .
Longer growth times usually result in larger crystals .
But if one waits too long , the excess Bismuth which has not yet gone into forming the crystal will solidify and trap the crystals which have formed .
There is no set amount of time one must wait before pouring out the excess Bismuth since it will vary depending on the conditions of the experiment .
One can test the state of the Bismuth by lighting tapping on the container .
If ripples are seen traveling across the surface then most of the Bismuth is still liquid .
As more of the Bismuth freezes , the ripples will have less space to travel and the areas where crystals are forming become visible .
Take care not to disturb the cooling Bismuth too much since it may trigger new crystal formation ; instead of producing just one ( or few ) large crystals , many much smaller crystals may form .
It may take several tries in order to get the hang of when to pour out the excess liquid Bismuth .
If one waits too long and the crystals become trapped just re-melt the Bismuth and try again .
One can even try to use the excess Bismuth which is poured off to form additional crystals in secondary containers .
Step 5 : Removing Crystals
Close up of newly formed crystals
before breaking them free from the
non-crystalline Bismuth which remains
behind in the cup .
The colorful and
geometrically interesting portion of the
crystal is facing down toward the
bottom of the cup ; the visible portion is
coated with thick gray oxide layer .
After pouring off the excess liquid Bismuth one should be able to see the Bismuth crystals which have grown inside the container .
The crystals ' color should develop within seconds upon exposure to air as a thin layer of oxidization forms on their surface .
The crystals will likely be stuck to the bottom and sides of the container ; they are also likely to be partially fused with non-crystalline Bismuth .
After they cool one can gently break off the crystals from the non-crystalline Bismuth inside the container .
Allowing the crystals to form on the inside surfaces of the container causes inherent imperfections in the crystals ' shape , since there will always be a point on the crystal where it was previously attached to that surface .
One can avoid this imperfection by using a small seed Bismuth crystal suspended in the molten Bismuth to act as a point of nucleation during crystal growth .
Afterward , one can then merely lift the crystal out of the liquid Bismuth rather than having to pour the excess Bismuth out into a separate container ( as in Step 4 ) .
Take care not to leave the seed crystal suspended too long as the Bismuth may solidify around it and make it impossible to extract .
Additionally , the crystal may grow so large it may fuse with other crystals surrounding it , thus also trapping it inside .
Like water / ice , Bismuth has the interesting property of expanding as it solidifies , thus causing unattached , solid , Bismuth crystals to float in their more dense , liquid , surroundings .
Pictures of large Bismuth crystals
Bellow is a series of images of three large Bismuth crystals ranging in size from about 1 inch to 3 inches wide .
It is certainly possible to grow much larger crystals than these .

FAITH & REASON FAITH & REASON Blog : Join the conversation on religion , spirituality and ethics | Forum : Debate fellow readers COMPARE CHANGES IN U.S. RELIGIONS OVER 2 DECADES COMPARE CHANGES IN U.S. RELIGIONS OVER 2 DECADES LOUISVILLE 
A mother is angry about a trip led by the head football coach at Breckinridge County High School .
The coach took about 20 players on a school bus late last month to his church , where nearly half of them — including her son — were baptized .
Michelle Ammons said her 16 - year - old son was baptized without her knowledge and consent , and she is upset that a public school bus was used to take players to a church service — and that the school district 's superintendent was there and did not object .
FAITH & REASON : Baptism field trip gives new twist to team spirit " Nobody should push their faith on anybody else , " said Ammons , whose son , Robert Coffey , said Coach Scott Mooney told him and other players that the Aug. 26 outing would include only a motivational speaker and a free steak dinner .
" He said it would bring the team together , " Robert , a sophomore , said in an interview .
Two other parents , however , said in interviews that their sons told them that Mooney had said the voluntary outing to Franklin Crossroads Baptist Church in Hardin County would include a revival .
Mooney , contacted by phone , said school district officials instructed him not to comment .
But Superintendent Janet Meeks , who is a member of the church and witnessed the baptisms , said she thinks the trip was proper because attendance was not required , and another coach paid for the gas .
Meeks said parents were n't given permission slips to sign but knew the event would include a church service , if not specifically a baptism .
She said eight or nine players came forward and were baptized .
" None of the players were rewarded for going and none were punished for not going , " Meeks said .
David Friedman , general counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union of Kentucky , said in an interview that the trip would appear to violate Supreme Court edicts on the separation of church and state — even if it was voluntary and the school district did n't pay for the fuel .
" If players want to attend the coach 's church and get baptized , that 's great , " Friedman said .
But a coach cannot solicit player attendance at school , he said , noting , " Coaches have great power and persuasion by virtue of their position , and they have to stay neutral . "
However , Matt Staver , founder and general counsel for Liberty Counsel , an Orlando - based group that provides free legal assistance in religious liberty cases , said there was nothing wrong with trip as long as it was voluntary and no public funds were used .
He compared it to a coach inviting players to attend a play or to go see a baseball game .
Neither the ACLU nor Liberty Counsel is involved in the Breckinridge County case .
The U.S. Supreme Court has said in school prayer cases that " at a minimum , the Constitution guarantees that government may not coerce anyone to support or participate in religion or its exercise , or otherwise act in a way that establishes a state religion or religious faith , or tends to do so . "
In March , the court rejected an appeal from a high school football coach in New Jersey who wanted to bow his head and kneel during prayers led by his players , despite a school district policy prohibiting it .
Meeks said she would have sought the consent of parents for the baptism of students if they had been " 7 or 8 or 9 " years old .
But she did n't think it was necessary for the players who are " 16 or 17 . "
She said that if Robert 's parents did n't know that the outing was going to include a revival service it was because " he apparently was not forthcoming with his parents . "
The church 's pastor , the Rev. Ron Davis , said that he requires minors to obtain their parents ' consent to be baptized , but he added : " Sometimes 16 - year - olds look like 18 years .
We did the best we could . "
He said the event on Aug. 26 " was a great service " and that attendance by the players was strictly voluntary .
" I trust the coach 100 % , " he said of Mooney .
" He is a fine young man and he is sure not going to manipulate anyone . "
Two parents , Tim Bruington and Eric Vertress , said in interviews that they knew through their children that the trip would include a revival - type service .
Bruington said his son , Tyler , a senior , decided not to go .
Vertress said his son , Matthew , elected to attend and that his mother drove to the church separately for the service .
Ammons , who lives in Big Spring , said that she is a Baptist but her husband , Danny , is Catholic , and that both feel like their son should wait until he is 18 to make important decisions on religion .
" We felt he was brainwashed , " she said .
She said she was prepared to drop the matter until she found out that Meeks attended the service .
She said she consulted a lawyer in Elizabethtown but has n't decided what action she will take .
" They have no right to take my son on a school bus across county lines to be a church to be baptized , " she said .

Natural killer cells are key part of our immune system defence A master gene that helps mobilise the immune system to fight disease has been discovered by UK scientists .
It causes stem cells in the blood to become disease - fighting " Natural Killer " ( NK ) immune cells .
It is hoped the discovery will lead to new ways to boost the body 's production of these frontline cells - potentially creating a new way to kill cancer .
The Nature Immunology study may also help development of new treatments for type 1 diabetes and multiple sclerosis .
These conditions are caused by a malfunctioning immune system turning against the body 's own tissues , and it is suspected that faulty NK cells play a key role in this process .
The researchers , from Imperial College London , University College London and the Medical Research Council 's National Institute for Medical Research have created mice that lack the key gene - E4bp4 .
If we understand how these cells function , we can hope to exploit this knowledge to improve treatments for cancer patients
Ken Campbell
Leukaemia Research
These animals are normal in every way except they have no NK cells at all .
In theory , they should provide scientists with a golden opportunity to pin down the role of NK cells in auto - immune diseases - and possibly in other conditions such as female infertility .
Properly functioning NK cells are a type of white blood cell central to the body 's first line of defence , rapidly killing off tumour cells , viruses and bacterial infections .
The latest work shows that the E4bp4 gene controls production of the cells from blood stem cells in the bone marrow .
The aim now is to develop a drug treatment ramping up production of NK cells .
Currently , NK cells isolated from donated blood are sometimes used to treat cancer patients - but the effectiveness of donated cells is limited because NK cells can be slightly different from person to person .
' Donor incompatibility ' Lead researcher Dr Hugh Brady said : " If increased numbers of the patient 's own blood stem cells could be coerced into differentiating into NK cells , via drug treatment , we would be able to bolster the body 's cancer - fighting force , without having to deal with the problems of donor incompatibility . "
The researchers were initially studying the effect of E4bp4 in a very rare but fatal form of childhood leukaemia when they discovered its importance for NK cells .
Ken Campbell , of the charity Leukaemia Research , said : " This study helps shed more light on the behaviour of NK cells , which is vital because if we understand how these cells function we can hope to exploit this knowledge to improve treatments for cancer patients . "

The Palestinian Authority said today it was suspending the West Bank operations of al - Jazeera , alleging incitement and unbalanced reporting by the Arab news station from the Palestinian territories .
A Palestinian official says the decision was taken by President Mahmoud Abbas who was outraged by an al - Jazeera talkshow , broadcast yesterday , that dealt with harsh accusations against PA leader by a long - time rival in his Fatah movement .
The rival , Farouk Kaddoumi , claimed – without presenting evidence – that Abbas had a role in the 2004 death of his predecessor , Yasser Arafat .
The official did not give his name because he was not authorised to speak to the media .
The information ministry accused the popular Arab satellite TV station of incitement and unbalanced reporting from the Palestinian territories , but did not provide details about the alleged incitement .
Abbas 's aides have long alleged that the Qatar - based station , which is widely watched in the Palestinian territories , has been siding with the Islamist movement Hamas in the bitter Palestinian power struggle .
Hamas seized Gaza by force in 2007 , ousting forces loyal to Abbas and leaving the president in control only of the West Bank .
Since then , Abbas has increasingly clamped down on Hamas in the West Bank .
A Hamas spokesman , Fawzi Barhoum , accused the West Bank government of trying to silence the media and " cover up what is going on in the West Bank " , a reference to Abbas 's crackdown on the Palestinian Islamist group .
In Gaza , Hamas has carried out similar raids , making arrests and shutting down Abbas - linked media outlets .
In a statement , the information ministry in the West Bank said it was suing al - Jazeera , and that the station 's operations would be suspended until a court has ruled .
The statement also said the ministry took particular issue with an al - Jazeera broadcast , but provided no details .
Representatives of the news network could not immediately be reached for comment .
The information ministry did not say whether al - Jazeera 's Ramallah office would be shut down , although employees could be seen collecting their belongings shortly after the announcement was made .
The network 's Arabic and English channels are bankrolled by the ruling family of Qatar , which also hosts the US military 's Middle East headquarters .
Al - Jazeera was often the target of criticism from George Bush 's administration , which called it biased against the US .
But it has also been lambasted by many governments in the Middle East for its often - critical coverage of the region .
The belief that everything is available for the right price is a Hollywood myth that really must go .
The Beatles sang better with ,  Money Cant Buy Me Love . 
For some reason , our fiat tokens are still being mistaken for real money .
And yet , I havent seen .357 Magnum on the shelves in the last 12 months .
Maybe thats why its already happening : Ammunition is being used for barter .
Blame who you will .
The green shoots of barter have appeared in anticipation of nobody knows what .
Ivory tower questions of if and should ( ammunition be used in barter ) have been answered by the not so invisible hand of the market .
That leaves questions of efficiency , demand , supply , resource allocation , liquidity and legality .
In particular :
How does ammo compare with money ?
How does ammo compare with other barter items ?
What supply and demand Factors are unique to ammunition ?
Which cartridges are best ?
How much is enough ?
What about reloading ?
Is it legal ?
For all its flaws , hassles and lack of precision , barter is a wonderful thing .
It gets people talking , needs are fulfilled , the exchange is personal and everyone leaves the table with real goods .
Lately , it appears the real good people want to leave the table with is ammunition .
Ammo vs. Money
We barter when money is not available , money is worthless or when goods are not available regardless of money .
Ammo is currently being used in barter because its not available regardless of money .
However , it ’s not hard to foresee a time when all three conditions would exist .
Gold and silver are the best money on earth for reasons listed in ,  Why is Gold Money ? 
They have all the key attributes of money and they have them in spades :
They score excellent within each category .
For instance , gold and silver are not only transportable , they are very transportable .
They are not only storable , they are very storable .
. . and on down the line with each attribute .
Going one by one comparing the attributes of money with ammunition , ammo is :
Transportable : Yes , if kept away from water and shipped within legal restrictions .
Divisible : Only within the same cartridge .
Safety would dictate that divisibility be further limited to manufactured lots .
Mixing different size cartridges is possible , but seldom done .
Storable : Yes , for about 50 years though with much less tolerances than gold or silver .
Ammo can be destroyed or unpredictable if wet .
Performance can also vary with ambient humidity .
Storability is on a par with wheat .
Fungible : No .
It has divisibility by cartridge but no fungibility .
Resilient : Yes , though with much less tolerances than gold or silver .
Ammo in water can not be trusted : Brass rusts while primers decay unpredictably .
Ammo is about as resilient as a large can of beans :
Once it s dented , less people trust it .
Measurable : Yes , within the same cartridge where components are consistent .
High Unit Value :
Yes , with values just above copper and lead though far below silver and gold .
Desirable : Yes , but not universally .
Desirability is limited to those in charge of security , hunting or those aware of a guns wide range of utility .
If the need for security grows the desire for each family to have some amount of ammunition will increase .
Rare : More and more each day .
Hard to Counterfeit : No .
But non-functional copies that pass muster are almost as expensive to make as a functional round .
So , ammunition is transportable , storable , resilient , measurable , has a High Unit Value , and is increasingly Desirable and Rare .
However , Divisibility is limited to cartridge and there is no Fungibility .
Counterfeiting is possible , but , non-functional copies that pass muster are expensive to make .
Ammunition has 7 out of the 10 attributes of money .
However , it does not perform nearly as well in those 7 attributes as does gold and silver .
If we hold ammunition to the same standards as gold and silver then it would be used as money only on a supplemental or transitional basis .
The most acceptable forms of tradable ammo would be cartridges in wide demand , manufactured with consistent and trusted components and transported and stored in a manner to keep it from coming into contact with water .
The end result being a half - dollar ( Or .45 ACP round , in this case ) that you could use to buy a pack of gum with in the morning or shoot a rattlesnake with in the afternoon !
If that s how Ammunition measures up against gold and silver how do Federal Reserve Tokens ( dollars ) measure up ?
Dollars vs. Money
Dollars are transportable , measurable and storable on a par with paper cut into uniform pieces .
They are not divisible , fungible , resilient , desirable or hard to counterfeit .
They do not have a high unit value and are rare on a par with the stars in the sky or the sand at the beach .
Dollars have 3 out of the 10 attributes of money , performing poorly within those attributes .
If we hold dollars to the same standards as gold and silver the dollars would be used as money only if a government forced their acceptance at the point of a gun .
The ammo in that gun would be a far superior form of money than the dollars they enforce .
Reverse Ammo Multipliers
A disastrous economy combined with an increasing awareness of the need for security is causing ammo to fly off the shelves .
The inability of manufactures to keep up with demand is making the lack of supply visible .
And Californias recent ban on the importation of ammunition and our growing distrust of the victim disarmament gang is not exactly quelling demand .
All these factors are ricocheting off one another and imparting to ammunition two of the key ingredients of money : Desirability and Rarity .
Another reverse multiplier is the falling dollar amidst surging commodity prices .
This dynamic duo is imparting to ammunition a third key ingredient of money : High Unit Value .
Ammunition Deflation
If ammo were being used as money , today , wed be in a deflationary period .
The ammo presses are not physically able to print enough .
What ammo is being printed is quickly purchased and shot off or saved for the future .
The only banking system is in personal physical storage where owners do not loan it back into the money supply .
That takes it completely out of circulation .
To make matters worse the ammo that is shot off is only partially recycled to bring it back into the money supply .
And more and more new gun owners are buying their first 200 rounds to practice with their favorite new security tool .
The net effect is that one unit of ammo can now purchase more goods and services .
If you had been using ammunition as money and savings you would have tripled the return you received on the equivalent amount of dollar savings over the last year .
In fact , if you substitute ammo for dollars it turns out the deflationists were right !
The Best of Terence Gillespie
I was 29 , single again after a five - year marriage , and a virgin .
When I met my now ex-husband Mike , I had just turned 21 .
We met at small Catholic liberal arts college , and even though I no longer believed in Jesus , the Saints , the Bible , God , really any of that , I was a virgin then and I was a virgin when we divorced .
When I was younger , I wanted to stay pure and had managed to protect my virginity despite all the high school guys I 'd went out with , and the ten or so guys I 'd dated in college before going out with Mike , my future husband .
My policy was to wear a Virgin Mary pendant on dates , just to be sure the guys I dated knew I was waiting .
Granted , I still almost lost it in the front seat of David Horowitz 's car the summer before junior year of high school .
I almost gave it up for him , and I let him put his hand down my pants , but I had to draw the line .
I certainly was n't going to do it with some guy who was going away to college in a few weeks , and I was n't going to lose it in his dad 's beat - up Ford Escort .
That was n't how I imagined my first time at all .
Every guy I went out with wanted to sleep with me by the third date , and every one of them lost interest when I wanted to wait .
By the time I met Mike , I was starting to wonder if date three might be good enough , even for me .
But after our third date , he told me he wanted to wait until we were married .
I could n't have been more shocked but as I got to know him , it made sense .
Mike was a Christian , I mean a real Christian : the kind that goes to Mass every Sunday , the kind that fears God , the Little House on the Prairie kind .
Plus , he was a supportive friend , so much kinder than anyone I 'd ever known .
He volunteered at homeless shelters and sang in the church choir .
He read all the right books , led several community groups and wanted to teach less fortunate children .
We got along great and naturally , I wanted to make out .
I wanted a repeat of what happened with David Horowitz in the Ford , only I wanted it with a good guy , someone who loved me .
But making out with Mike always felt so mechanical .
Though I was n't that experienced , the other guys I 'd been with usually got me so excited and lost in the moment that all that stood between me and his penis inside of me was that Virgin Mary pendant .
None of that ever happened with Mike .
I was always able to concentrate , think clearly and keep my cool .
It was so refreshing not to be the teary , hysterical mess I was with the other guys that I thought , maybe this friendship is better than sex .
And how would I know ?
I had never done the deed .
During our make - out sessions , I always felt like I was directing a blind actor on a cluttered stage .
" Go to the right , no a little more , no back to the left , wait , too fast . "
It was always stressful , and over time , it became tedious .
Mike had no creative ideas of his own .
I 'd never been with anyone so asexual .
It seemed like if I had n't climbed on top of him on our third date , nothing would have ever happened .
But I kept thinking he was the best person I 'd ever known , and maybe things would get better after we got married .
And I just kept thinking : what was a great sexual relationship in comparison to all this ?
It seemed so shallow of me to dump someone who had become my best friend just because he could n't get me off without a world atlas .
Finally , after two years of dating , our wedding night came .
Of course by now , I 'd sort of lost the anticipation .
So that night , we tried and failed .
While he was getting ready for bed , I put on a transparent white nightgown my mother bought me for my big night .
As I waited on the bed , with a fireplace roaring in front of it , I felt like I was in a play , only all my stage directions were missing .
What was I supposed to do ?
Lie down and wait for him to take me , missionary style ?
The entire time we'd been dating , I had felt in charge of our sexual relationship , but I had no idea how to make sex happen .
Apparently neither did he , because he simply started kissing me awkwardly as he positioned himself on top of me .
It was not erotic ; it was forced .
He had not done anything seductive in the hours , let alone minutes , leading up to our big scene .
I stopped him and told him I just could n't do it .
Michael did n't seem upset , only slightly disappointed that things did n't turn out differently .
We kept right on trying for weeks , for months , for years , and kept right on failing .
He could never stay hard long enough to get inside of me .
And I could never get excited enough to let him in .
I began thinking , in my obsessive way , maybe I was just too small .
Maybe I had some impenetrable vagina that only the strongest , hardest penis could penetrate .
Maybe my hymen was like a personal Great Wall of China .
But really , between his giant penis , his premature ejaculation problem and my tight - as - a - virgin - because - I - was - a - virgin problem , well , the whole thing was pretty much doomed .
After five years of marriage , we broke it off .
We had tried couples counseling and everything else : lingerie , candles , massage oil .
Nothing worked .
I would have thought I was hopelessly frigid , except right around the time we started counseling , I started spending time with an old friend , Sam .
Mike and I had recently moved to a new town and Sam happened to live a few blocks away .
Ever since college , I had been attracted to Sam , but one of us was always attached when the other was single .
Sam was flirtatious , sensual and confident .
He was extremely open about sex and obviously experienced .
My feelings for him became overwhelming and I worried I 'd have an affair with him — or at least try to .
I stopped seeing him , but because of him , I knew that I was capable of feeling that way .
And after so many tries with Michael , I knew we just were n't meant to be .
He cried horribly when I told him it was over , but he also did n't seem surprised .
Six months later , we sold our home and a month after that , our divorce was finalized .
I was 28 , divorced and , worst of all , still a virgin .
After the divorce , I could n't wait to meet someone who would have sex with me .
But I was still worried about my dysfunctional , overly small vagina .
I was absolutely certain that there was something wrong with me .
I mean , how could a penis have never gotten in there ?
I had to be sure that when I found someone that sex would " work " and that I would n't find another premature ejaculator with an abnormally large penis .
I 'm a teacher , so I made myself a syllabus .
I might not be able to fix the vagina problem , but I could at least know what I was doing .
I read the Kama Sutra and I bought several instructional DVDs and several vibrators .
I figured I could start with the non-threatening pink one and work up to the more intimidating white one and then I 'd be ready for the real thing , no matter how huge it might turn out to be .
When I finished my self - imposed syllabus , I began looking for a man .
I went online and met Joshua .
He seemed perfect on paper : part Native American , spiritual but not religious , and newly divorced .
I knew I would never fall in love with him — perfect .
I was n't ready to start loving again ; I just wanted to have sex .
I invited him to my house for dinner , figuring it would take quite a few dates before we actually did anything .
Of course I did n't mention the virgin problem or my possibly impenetrable vagina .
We ended up talking on my couch in front of my fireplace .
He asked if I 'd like to hear him play some Native American flute music .
Then he started showing me his tattoos , all very tribal .
Before long , we were making out .
I did n't stop him when he took his pants off , and I did n't care when he took mine off .
It did n't occur to me that he wanted to have sex .
As he started pulling off my panties , I reasoned it would probably take several attempts to get inside of me , and I highly doubted he could penetrate the wall .
I was certain he'd have to do something special , something that I had n't learned or Mike did n't know to do .
It did n't even dawn on me that he was n't putting on a condom .
Within about two seconds , he was inside of me .
It was shockingly simple .
Nothing could have prepared me for it .
How could something that had evaded me for this long , something that had ruined my marriage to an otherwise great guy , something that I feared and longed for , something that had driven me to go on anti-depressants and take up hobbies like beading and dancing and learning Spanish — turn out to be so simple ?
And then it was over .
He came within a minute .
By the time I got used to how it felt having a man inside of me , he was out and lying on his side .
It did n't hurt like I 'd expected but it did n't last long enough to feel good .
I wanted more .
I wanted the positions I 'd memorized ; I wanted it to not be over .
But all Joshua said was , " Wow , that was great .
Wish I had a cigarette . "
I scanned his face for some look of recognition , something .
But he did n't know he just had sex with a virgin .
The next day , I asked him to have breakfast with me , but he said he had to go .
I felt rejected , but I also knew that having sex on a first date was not the greatest set - up for a relationship .
I also knew that I had no real connection with Joshua .
He called me a few days later but the conversation was awkward .
We never saw each other again .
Still , I felt relieved , and I looked at the entire incident as a rough draft attempt at the real thing .
At least I was n't a freak of nature and at least I knew it was n't me all those years .
Six years have past since then , and I 've had a lot of sex with a few different men .
But I still have n't managed to put love and sex together in the same person .
I wish I could tell you that it does n't matter , that I 'm not waiting any more , that great sex is just , well , great .
But I 'm still hoping for something that does n't resemble a poorly written romance novel .
Sometimes I still feel a pang of regret about Mike because we had a real friendship , and I loved him .
He was someone I could laugh with , cry with and fight with , a true best friend .
I want , more than anything , to combine something like that with a physical connection .
I keep being drawn one or the other , but neither one is satisfying if you do n't have both .

My sons Winters and Teddy are video game fanatics .
I thought there might be some nice overlap between “ virtual estate ” and real estate so I asked them , and their friends , to brainstorm some of the cooler pads they ’d come across .
I thought it would be fun to assign a value to a few of them using some of the basic criteria a person would use in appraising an actual home .
I mean , who would n’t want a castle of their very own ?
Or deluxe accommodations in an underwater utopia where nothing could ever go wrong ?
There are plenty of amazing properties that play a prominent role in video games ( as well as some real duds ) .
So , looking at some very basic information , here are the “ asking prices ” for 8 well - known video game properties .
– Matt
A Condominium in the Liberty City Suburb of Dukes ( GTA IV ) Location : Located in one of the nicest areas of the admittedly terrifying Liberty City , a condominium like the one pictured is a highly desirable piece of real estate .
Comparable Properties : Probably most on par with a luxury townhouse in either New York or Chicago , we ’ll assume we ’re looking for something in the 2 bedroom 1.5 bath range .
Curb Appeal :
The buildings are in great condition and there ’s no real downside unless an out of control car chase happens to go careening by while potential buyers are taking a tour .
Value : $ 1.5 million
One of Bowser ’s Decoy Castles ( Super Mario Bros . )
Location : Why , the Mushroom Kingdom , of course .
Comparable Properties : Aside from the 6 other almost identical looking decoy castles , the palace you enter at the end of stage 1 - 3 is a pretty unique property .
However , given the lava pits and rotating fire death traps within , we ’ll put this on par with your average dilapidated castle .
Curb Appeal : From the outside it looks pretty imposing , but as alluded to earlier , the fact that pretty much everything inside is designed to kill you could turn this property into a huge money pit for whoever buys it .
Value : $ 1.5 million
Average Accommodations in Rapture ( Bioshock ) Location : Beneath the Atlantic Ocean .
( 63° 2 ′ N , 29° 55 ′ W to be exact . )
Comparable Properties :
The closest real location would be the Hydropolis Hotel in Dubai , which is reported to cost upward of 550 million dollars .
So , we can use that number as a very loose benchmark for Rapture ’s total cost , and given the scope of the 1946 project versus the 2009 hotel , we ’ll just choose to ignore inflation .
Curb Appeal :
No real curb , given that it ’s under water .
However , Rapture definitely has a major “ wow ” factor .
Value : $ 750,000 plus
A House in Megaton ( Fallout 3 ) Location :
One of the two largest settlements in the Capital Wastelands , the city of Megaton is set in a crater and surrounded by impenetrable walls .
Comparable Properties :
If you do n’t account for factors like post - apocalyptic ghouls , molerats , and raiders driving up real estate prices in any protected area , the closest comparison to Megaton would be pretty much any trailer park in Washington DC ’s surrounding areas .
Curb Appeal : Minimal curb appeal , as most homes are little more than wooden shanties , some of which are actually on stilts .
Value : $ 25,000
Zombie Infested Mansion ( Resident Evil ) Location : Raccoon City , somewhere in the Midwest Comparable Properties :
If you subtract the zombies , secret passageways .
and underground lab , this property can easily be compared to a plantation style mansion .
Curb Appeal :
It ’s a bit rundown , and there are ferocious dogs on the premises , but the property should still appeal to someone who is n’t afraid to put some time into getting the building back into a livable state .
Also , it ’s perfect for flipping .
Value : $ 2 million ( with $ 4 million potential )
House in Hyrule Castle Town ( Ocarina of Time ) Location : The Kingdom of Hyrule , within the outer palace wall in the castle town itself .
Comparable Properties :
Since we ’re dealing with a different time period all together , let ’s go with the 2009 equivalent and compare this directly to having a downtown loft right in the heart of where the action is .
For convenience sake we ’ll set the location somewhere in SOMA in San Francisco .
Curb Appeal :
It ’s all about the location and convenience , but there ’s nothing flashy about these cozy cottages .
Value : $ 1 million
Boat House ( Left 4 Dead ) Location : Secluded riverside boat house just outside a major city .
Some evidence suggests it ’s probably in Pennsylvania .
Comparable Properties : Since Left 4
Dead is rumored to take place in Pennsylvania , let ’s use Erie as a baseline and compare this boathouse to pretty much any modest piece of property located on Lake Erie .
Curb Appeal : Definitely a no frills piece of property that will only appeal to hermits , farmers , or people looking for a remote getaway in the event of a zombie holocaust .
Value : $ 100,000 ( only accounting for the house and a small portion of surrounding land )
A study of New York City ’s pioneering law on posting calories in restaurant chains suggests that when it comes to deciding what to order , people ’s stomachs are more powerful than their brains .
The study , by several professors at New York University and Yale , tracked customers at four fast - food chains  McDonald ’s , Wendy ’s , Burger King and Kentucky Fried Chicken  in poor neighborhoods of New York City where there are high rates of obesity .
It found that about half the customers noticed the calorie counts , which were prominently posted on menu boards .
About 28 percent of those who noticed them said the information had influenced their ordering , and 9 out of 10 of those said they had made healthier choices as a result .
But when the researchers checked receipts afterward , they found that people had , in fact , ordered slightly more calories than the typical customer had before the labeling law went into effect , in July 2008 .
The PS3 Motion Controller is set to break new ground in the game industry , with its perfect 1 - to - 1 motion sensing and innovative camera - based setup .
But what ’s even more interesting than the future of this product is just how exactly it was created .
Check out this in depth look into the tech and brain matter behind Sony Computer Entertainment ’s new motion controller , straight from their internal R&D department !

The planet Jupiter is currently the brightest star - like object in the sky An Irish astronomy group is calling for help in tracing the origin of a huge explosion in the skies over the country on Thursday evening .
Astronomy Ireland said it was currently investigating the explosion , which occurred at 2100 BST .
A spokesman said the most likely explanation was a space rock or satellite crashing into the atmosphere .
The group wants anyone who witnessed the event to contact its website at www.astronomy.ie Astronomy Ireland chairman David Moore said : " So far , reports have been registered by residents in west Cork , Kerry , Cavan and as far north as Donegal , thus suggesting that this spectacular event may have been witnessed by people all over the country .
" In the past two decades there have been two major explosions in the skies over Ireland .
" When we investigated these , we were able to conclude that one was a Russian military satellite that exploded over the country , and the other was a rock from space which we predicted would have fallen on Carlow and this rock was indeed found , becoming the last meteorite fall of the millennium . "
Mr Moore said the explosion should not be confused with a hugely - bright star which was positioned just below the full moon on Thursday night .
" This was actually the planet Jupiter and it can be characterised by being by far the brightest star in the entire night sky , " he said .

Choose one of your two hat halves , and set this aside .
This is going to be the outside part of the hat !
Cut 8 six inch lengths of the black wire .
You can shorten them later if you want !
Swirl one end of each of these , so you have a couple loops .
Take a small crochet hook or the metal end piece of a mechanical pencil , and poke four holes about a 1 / 2 inch apart near the front of the hat on each side .
( You might want to try the hat on to get an idea of where you want them to be .
Enter hat hair , as demonstrated below . )
Push the wire through from the wrong side of the hat , so that the swirly bit is on the inside . :)
Now , take a needle and some white thread , and secure these loops to the inside of the hat so they lay flat .
This will make your whiskers stay in place and be more rigid !
Hooray !
Once you 've secured all of them , fold them up so that you can sew the whole hat together !
This step has a ton of pictures .
I got excited .
Sorry . :)

On Wednesday July 29 , 2009 , Tim Cope gave a presentation at Cafe Amsterdam in Ulaanbaatar , Mongolia on his horseback trekking adventure across the steppes and grasslands of Mongolia to Hungary .
Tim spoke of the challenges and issues he faced while traveling during zud ( extreme cold winter ) and deserts ( up to 50C high ) from Mongolia through Kazakhtsan , Russia , and Ukraine on the way to Hungary following in the footsteps of Chinggis Khaan , the correct spelling of Genghis Khan .
Here are some highlights of interesting notes and things of which he spoke .
Tim Cope ’s Journey Across Steppes of Central Asia
The first question that seems to come to everyone ’s mind …
Why did you decide to travel this route ?
As you may know , Tim actually traveled trough Mongolia with a friend back in 2000 on a bicycle .
He traveled from South to North ( i.e. China to Russia through Mongolia ) .
Apparently , he even was arrested for not using public transportation in China .
But something about Mongolia really left a mark on Tim : it was the first time in his life that he had been in “ a very big place with no fences ” .
Long story short , he “ ran into some horsemen that inspired him ” and got the idea that he should travel through Mongolia on a horse .
A fun fact about Tim Cope ’s travel through the steppes
The most number of days without a shower : 24
“ A man with friends is as wide as the steppe ”
During his journey , Tim realized the truth behind the Mongolian saying “ a man on the steppe without friends is as narrow as a finger .
A man with friends is as wide as the steppe . ”
Getting through the countryside safe from the harsh weather , wolves , and possible thieves could n’t be done easily without the help of friends and making connections with the people on the steppe .
Note : I have referred to the Nomads as people of the steppe .
Both terms and definitions can be used interchangeably in this context .
For whatever reasons , I have used the steppe or people of the steppe more so than nomads .
However , this post could probably be used to gain some insights into nomads and nomadic ways of life .
“ Never enough days for planning ”
Tim found that there was not a single day that he did not face issues and challenges .
There were days he wanted to pack up and call it quits .
The thing is that there really is not enough days for planning .
And , there actually is no way to plan for the entire trip .
As he said , there will be challenges and issues that we just cannot plan for .
The most important thing is weight
Tim said this in reference to traveling on a horse .
He mentioned that “ a horse can travel 300 km in a day , but you could kill a horse in 50 km ” to highlight the point that keeping light and taking care of the horses is of utmost importance .
He said that keeping the horses fed and watered was the biggest challenge .
Zud , a freezing severe winter weather in Mongolia
Tim ran into zud in Mongolia .
During zud , a Mongolian term describing freezing severe cold weather , literally everything in the area is frozen and covered in centimeters thick ice sheets .
Plants , grasses , and gers would all be covered in by this freezing winds and weather .
This makes it very difficult to survive , let alone find food for the horses .
Tim Cope mentioned that he met a family in Bayan - Ulgii , the western - most province of Mongolia , that had one horse survive out of 300 !
During zud years in middle of 2000 ’s , Mongolia lost millions of herds to zud .
You can just imagine seeing the tragedy of so many animals frozen to death in blistering cold weather with temperatures easily dipping much lower than 40C .
My own addition into the story – >
Interestingly , goats have a way of surviving cold weathers .
When sheeps freeze , often goats are found standing on top to survive ”
“ Time in the steppe is measured by the seasons ”
Tim Cope ’s trip was originally planned to be completed within 18 months .
The actual trip took 3 1/2 years .
The lesson learned : in the steppe , one cannot put a deadline because as soon as you put a deadline on time , you are set to fail or not reach it .
Three times
Tim picked a time for his mother and his family ; and , all three dates were not met .
“ Time in the steppe is measured by time . ”
And , you cannot rush time nor weather conditions .
He learned this quote in Kazakhstan .
He tried leaving one small village in the winter 9 times ( I believe this is what he said ) , but he failed all nine times due to a variety of reasons .
“ If you ever have to rush in life , rush slowly ”
This is a famous saying in Kazakhstan and what Tim really learned from being stuck during the harsh winter weather there .
After failed attempts to leave , Tim forgot his plans and started again in spring .
And , this was really the beginning of becoming a nomad for Tim .
Tim also made a very interesting point to all the travelers , visitors , and even the nationals of Mongolia : “ You ca n’t really appreciate the summer in Mongolia if you were n’t here for the winter . ”
In the steppe , hospitality is obligatory not a choice
During his travels , Tim recalls meeting a nomadic family with 17 or 18 extra mats for traveling passerby ’s .
It ’s very difficult to survive in this harsh weather without being hospitable to others and also being hospitable as well .
In Kazakhstan , there is a saying that when you are supposed to host guests and doing so brings good karma and chases bad karma or spirits out through the top opening of gers or yurts .
And , visiting is not just an hour long chat .
Each one is a three day feast .
After a while , it was very difficult to travel without being invited in , so Tim started traveling in a very wide circle around the homes of people in Kazakhstan .
There is another quote that helps describe the hospitality of the steppe people .
The quote goes something like this : the first time a person is a guest , the second time he / she is friend , and third time he / she is family for life .
( Please correct me if I ’ve misspoken on the first or second meeting / visit ) .
There is also another great quote : “ mountains never meet … but people do ”
By the way , it should be noted that Tim spent 14 months in Kazakhstan and really learned the majority of his knowledge about being a nomad and understanding the ways of nomadic life there .
Summer heats in deserts
One of Tim ’s major challenges were the extreme hot days during summertime in deserts .
The highs reached 40 or 50 degrees Celsius , and it became very challenging for him or the horses to travel .
As such , his major challenge was to find a shelter before the sweltering heat and sleeping during the day to travel at night .
There were so much more …
There were so much more that he spoke and talked about in his hour and a half long presentation that I simply have ran out of time .
There were things like :
Tim ’s experience with wolves in Mongolia
Thieves stealing horses and finding them back – on two different occasions in two different countries
During the Q&A session , he covered things like …
He had a great dog travel with him from Kazakhstan , but he could n’t bring the dog to Australia because of the costs involved until just recently .
It was something like $ 10 K to bring back the dog .
It was a very happy reunion after maybe two years of separation .
Had Kazakh horses and they were donated to children ’s riding organization in Hungary
Kalmitia – jungars or uigars
black sea
Tartar people
Hungars – people from central Asia
Finding sponsors which funded maybe for half his trip .
The planned costs were about $ 10 / day excluding horses and equipment .
I believe he is working on a book
So , if you are interested in learning more and reading in depth about his horse trekking adventure across central Asia and Europe from Mongolia to Hungary , where the steppe ends , you might have to wait for the book to come out .
Judging from his presentation skills , Tim ’s new book could be a best - seller .
During the presentation , Tim had a way of truly conveying the thoughts and feelings as if we , the audience , were traveling ourselves … but he did so in an interesting , informative , but also very fun manner .
He had lots of great jokes , which I cannot duplicate here .
You just have to wait for the book to come out just like the rest of us . 😉
When the book comes out , I will make sure to notify everybody who leaves a comment with interest here on this blog .
Maybe
Tim will give us discount . 😀

Americans are dying at a faster rate — 1 every 12 minutes , 5 an hour , 120 a day , 45,000 a year — not from war or natural disaster , but from lack of health insurance .
That ’s the stunning finding of a study published today in the American Journal of Public Health by leading researchers at Harvard Medical School .
The report , “ Health Insurance and Mortality in U.S. Adults , ” reveals that the uninsured have a 40 percent higher risk of death than those with private insurance , resulting in 45,000 preventable deaths annually .
These are our friends and neighbors , our fellow Americans who ca n’t afford or otherwise get private health insurance .
Increasingly , this group includes nearly all lower - income and a growing majority of middle - class Americans .
The Institute of Medicine estimated in 2002 that more than 18,000 Americans between the ages of 19 and 64 were dying each year as a result of being uninsured .
The new number is two and a half times that figure .
Trying to get by , the uninsured and underinsured delay necessary care , put off filling drug prescriptions or take only some of their medications each day .
Most are just one major illness or accident away from financial ruin .
A growing number of patients with cancer have to turn down recommended chemotherapy or radiation treatment because of inability to pay for care .
If they have insurance , many find that the small print in their policies excludes such coverage .
If they are uninsured , their risk of death multiplies .
No one in dire need of medical care should be put in this lose - lose situation .
We ’re not talking about a third world country .
This is the United States , one of the most industrialized nations in the world .
But increasingly , we look more like a developing country — 42nd in the world for life expectancy ( behind Japan and most of Europe ) , and ranked last among 19 OECD countries in preventable deaths that should not occur in the presence of timely and effective health care .
Meanwhile , the charade goes on , as our elected representatives in Congress dither over health care reform .
None of the bills in Congress will resolve the affordability and access problems .
The Congressional Budget Office estimates the House health reform bill would still leave 17 million persons uninsured and that Sen. Baucus ’ bill , unveiled yesterday , would leave 25 million uninsured .
That translates into tens of thousands of unnecessary deaths every year .
There are now 3,300 health industry lobbyists running around Washington , D.C. , trying to shape the small print to their advantage in whatever bill finally gets passed ( if any ) .
The insurance and pharmaceutical companies and their hangers - on are spending $ 5 million a week to block real reform .
Suffice it to say that none of these companies have the best interests of the uninsured or the underinsured at heart .
Through its trade group , America ’s Health Insurance Programs , the industry is fighting for its life ( but not our lives ) .
And so far , it is winning .
By “ cooperating ” with health care “ reform ” by pledging to eliminate pre-existing conditions as a barrier to coverage , and saying they will take all comers in return for a government mandate that everyone be required to buy its shoddy products , the insurers are poised to reap a massive financial windfall .
So far , the bills in Congress set no limits on what the insurers can charge for premiums , and the legal requirements for covered benefits are likely to be minimal .
If a “ reform ” bill along these lines passes , it will be a bonanza for insurers , drug and medical device manufacturers , and other players in the medical - industrial complex , all at our expense .
Since their revenues are our costs ( as patients and taxpayers ) , there will be no cost containment .
We can prevent another 45,000 Americans from dying next year .
An effective cure to the health care crisis is within our reach , and it lies within a single - payer , Medicare - for - All plan .
By cutting out private insurance companies , we would not only save taxpayers billions , but deliver quality care to everyone .
We should n’t have to wait another 12 minutes .
Dr. John Geyman is professor emeritus of family medicine at the University of Washington School of Medicine in Seattle , a past president of Physicians for a National Health Program and author of Do Not Resuscitate : Why the Health Insurance Industry Is Dying , and How We Must Replace It .

On a recent afternoon at the Henderson , Nevada , headquarters of Zappos , America ’s leading online shoe retailer , Katrina Jadkowski , a member of the company ’s three - hundred - and - fifty - person Customer Loyalty Team , was on the phone with an elderly woman named Susie , from Aurora , Colorado , who wanted to exchange a pair of too - snug New Balance sneakers .
“ I just got back in town and I have an orthotics appointment , ” Susie said , sounding a bit anxious about this newfangled shopping experience .
Thanks to Zappos ’s yearlong return policy , we can all be Imelda Marcos .

Jadkowski , a British - born , divorced former showgirl whose colleagues have nicknamed her Hurricane , arranged to have a UPS return label printed and a replacement pair , size 5 ½ EE , shipped free , overnight .
“ That ’s just beautiful — I love this company ! ” Susie shouted .
Typing in the order rapidly , red flower decals on her fingernails , Jadkowski told Susie that it was Zappos ’s tenth anniversary and upgraded her to V.I.P. status — which pretty much any Zappos shopper can attain , merely by asking .
( The URL of the V.I.P. site is intended to encourage the intimate act of bookmarking , since a Google search for “ sensible black pumps ” or “ running shoes ” will also turn up the company ’s competitors . )
Male callers in particular seem to enjoy the upgrade , with its suggestion of velvet - roped back rooms .
Susie , too , was pleased .
“ Oh , that ’s fabulous ! ” she said .
“ This is super . ”
The two women giggled conspiratorially for a few moments , and Jadkowski asked if there was anything else she could do .
“ No , ” Susie said .
“ Oh , I ’m tickled . ”
Jadkowski wished her a nice day and disconnected the call .
“ Sometimes you just need to let them natter on , ” she said , not unkindly .
The Customer Loyalty Team , or C.L.T. , is the nerve center of Zappos , whose thirty - five - year - old C.E.O. , Tony Hsieh , has earned a zealous following by imposing an ethos of live human connection on the chilly , anonymous bazaar of the Internet .
He talks about being the architect of a movement to spread happiness , or “ Zappiness , ” via three “ C ”s : clothing , customer service , and company culture .
“ Eventually , we ’ll figure out a way of spreading that knowledge to the world in general , and that has nothing to do with selling shoes online , ” he told me after I visited the company over the summer .
Owning a large collection of shoes in various styles and colors has , in the past decade , gone from being considered a sign of ultimate imperial excess ( Imelda Marcos ) to a constitutional right of the average American woman , and Zappos is at least partly responsible .
( So is “ Sex and the City . ” )
Hsieh ( pronounced “ shay ” ) has changed the business so radically that , in July , Amazon.com , after trying to compete with Zappos by starting a shoe site called Endless.com , as if to sanction the new insatiability , announced plans to buy the company for ten million shares of stock ( worth $ 790 million at press time ) plus $ 40 million in cash .
In an S.E.C. filing , Amazon vowed to leave Zappos ’s management structure intact .
“ There ’re plenty of companies that do n’t grow , and that ’s fine for , like , your mom - and - pop corner store , ” Hsieh said to me two weeks later , over the phone from Minneapolis , where he was addressing General Mills .
( He has become a coveted “ get ” on the motivational - speaker circuit . )
“ But , for me personally at Zappos , the company needs to grow in order for the movement to happen . ”
When he was asked how he and Amazon ’s C.E.O. , Jeff Bezos , will share power in the new order , he said , “ Yeah . . . we ’ll see . ”
At its most rarefied , shoe shopping still takes place in hushed , pastel - carpeted salons , with salesmen ( they are usually men — one does n’t like to think too closely about why ) staggering under stacks of boxes and kneeling down to insure the perfect fit before whisking away the charge plates of their waiting Cinderellas .
Some people still consider pawing through the sale racks at Bloomingdale ’s or the fluorescent - lit aisles of the Designer Shoe Warehouse an enjoyable contact sport .
But Zappos and its imitators — shoes.com , heels.com , and the Gap ’s inexplicably named piperlime.com — are shifting this public transaction into the comfort and privacy of customers ’ living rooms .
There , thanks to Zappos ’s three - hundred - and - sixty - five - day return policy , we can all be Imelda Marcos , sifting through ceiling - high piles of boxes , and waiting in sweatpanted indolence for the UPS man to pick up our rejects .
Unlike most Web sites , including Amazon ’s , which seem to be operated by spectral forces rather than by human beings , Zappos prominently displays a toll - free customer - service phone number .
There are no limits on call times , and the resulting sessions occasionally resemble protracted talk therapy .
On July 5th , a twenty - two - year - old C.L.T . member named Britnee Brown , who has been with the company for a little more than a year , took a call that was a record five hours , twenty - five minutes , and thirty - one seconds long , from a woman on the East Coast interested in Masai Barefoot Technology shoes , which purport to mimic supposedly salubrious barefoot - on - the - beach walking with curved rubber platforms .
“ We started talking about her sister , ” Brown said .
The call that set the previous record lasted more than four hours , with a woman afflicted by peripheral neuropathy who had trouble feeling her feet .
“ She told me childhood stories , things like that , ” Jennifer S. , the operator who handled that one , said in a video posted on YouTube .
Zappos has advertised sparingly thus far , preferring word of mouth , and ( unlike most companies ) encourages employees to let it all hang out on Twitter and Facebook .
This marketing strategy seems to be working , up to a point .
In the first half of 2009 , not generally considered a bright spot for American retail , buyers of fashion footwear spent almost twenty per cent more through online - only channels than they had the previous year , according to the NPD Group , a market - research firm , while sales at shoe chains , department stores , and stand - alone shops were down about eleven per cent each .
In 2008 , Zappos surpassed a billion dollars in gross sales , an occasion that its fiercely clannish employees — who operate under a program of ten Core Values ( No. 3 : Create Fun and a Little Weirdness ) — celebrated with clanging cowbells , followed by vodka shots at a local Claim Jumper restaurant .
Because of the lenient return policy , however , net sales were only six hundred and thirty - five million dollars , according to the Amazon S.E.C. filing , and , after operating costs , net profits were $ 10.8 million , which explains why Hsieh , though he insisted that “ the Amazon thing is not about the money , ” might have been amenable to an infusion of capital .
The Henderson headquarters , three squat beige buildings surrounded by palm and flowering plum trees , have become an unlikely pilgrimage spot for businesspeople , tourists , and the odd celebrity , many ferried to and from their hotels on the Las Vegas Strip in a complimentary shuttle van .
Inside , they are greeted by a concierge - like Help Desk of about a dozen support personnel , whose services include occasional free hugs .
Apart from a smattering of shoe samples , there is no physical evidence of the company ’s wares on the premises .
( Merchandise is stored in and shipped from an eight - hundred - and - thirty - two - thousand - square - foot warehouse , roamed by robots , in Shepherdsville , Kentucky . )
Visitors come to marvel at the spectacle of peppy , dedicated workers : a utopia of communal cheer and solicitude ; trilled “ Good morning ” s and “ Hi , pumpkin ! ”s ; free vats of popcorn , nuts , and trail mix ; and politely held doors .
Entering the lobby , which was decorated with Christmas lights at the height of the desert summer , a stranger gets the feeling that amphetamines might be pumped through the central air - conditioning .
On my maiden shuttle trip , the driver mentioned that the relentlessly upbeat vibe at Zappos — Core Value No. 7 : Build a Positive Team and Family Spirit — had broken up her marriage .
“ My husband did n’t fit in with the culture , ” she said .
“ He was too gangsta . ”
Zappos was founded in 1999 , during the first Internet gold rush , by a Bay Area entrepreneur named Nick Swinmurn .
He ’d been irritated when he could n’t find a pair of brown Airwalks at his local mall .
Hsieh , originally an adviser and investor through a concern called Venture Frogs , joined the company a year later .
After graduating from Harvard , he ’d operated an Internet ad - banner venture called LinkExchange with a classmate , Alfred Lin ( now Zappos ’s C.O.O. ) , which was sold to Microsoft for two hundred and sixty - five million dollars in 1998 .
Hsieh was rich , and bored .
“ I just liked working for Zappos , ” he said .
“ It was about :
What kind of company can we create where we all want to be there , including me ?
How can we create such a great environment , where employees get so much out of it that they would do it for free ? ”
And , in fact , some Zapponians , as they are known , draw a wage as low as eleven dollars an hour .
“ I ’m not trying to be beautiful — I ’m just trying to look better than everyone else there . ”

Shopping
The company ’s name comes from the Spanish word for shoe , zapato , a word that also turned out to be fortuitously evocative of the way goods are “ zapped ” to customers .
( Core Value No. 1 : Deliver WOW Through Service . )
A C.L.T. manager named Jane Judd , her eyes damp , described a Q. & A. session she had heard Hsieh conduct with some visiting Time Warner executives .
“ Our service is n’t everything it could be , ” he ’d said .
“ If we did n’t have to think about cost , the reps would personally get on a plane today and deliver that box . ”
“ I always call him my little Dalai Lama , ” Judd said .
Soft - spoken and introverted , Hsieh has become an unlikely business guru : a young philosopher prince of the middle - management set , to whom he is fond of distributing an annual “ Culture Book ” of warbling testimonials collected from Zappos employees , as if it were the Gideon Bible , and recommending titles on the science of happiness , like “ The Happiness Hypothesis , ” by Jonathan Haidt , and “ Happier , ” by Tal Ben - Shahar .
He is also writing a book of his own for Grand Central Publishing , tentatively titled “ Delivering Happiness ” — “ a combination of talking about Zappos , the culture , core values , and the science of happine_ssss_ , ” he said , stretching out the word .
For Hsieh , happiness is a quantifiable quality that seems synonymous with “ calm . ”
“ Generally , I associate drama with negative emotions , and I want to experience positive emotions , ” he said .
It was a week before the Amazon deal was announced , to general shock within the company , where Hsieh , whose mother is a clinical psychologist , has promoted a culture of absolute transparency ( Core Value No. 6 : Build Open and Honest Relationships with Communication ) .
He was standing at the back of a classroom filled with twenty out - of - town businesspeople who ’d paid five thousand dollars apiece for a symposium titled “ Zappos Insights Live ” : a two - day “ culture immersion ” into the company .
They ’d been instructed to write two truths about themselves and one lie on an index card , then stand up and name their favorite movie .
“ ‘ Forrest Gump , ’ ” one of them , a gangly young man named Eric James , from a company in Colorado called PosterBrain.com , said , to murmurs of approval .
A “ Zappos Insights ” leader read James ’s card : “ Pickled pigs ’ feet was my favorite food as a kid . ” ( True . )
“ My first business was inventing magic tricks . ” ( True . )
“ I ’ve visited over 100 countries . ” ( Lie . )
“ For favorite movie , I ’m gonna have to say . . . my life ? ” said a perky auburn - haired woman , Camille Preston , who works in executive development at a company called Aim Leadership .
After about an hour of this , Hsieh glided to the front of the room , wearing jeans , a silky black shirt , untucked , and black shoes , and began a laid - back PowerPoint presentation .
“ What would you be passionate about doing , even if you never made a dime ? ” he asked the assembled .
“ What is your goal in life ?
For almost everyone , it comes down to happiness . ”
He moistened his lips , and summoned a bouncing smiley face onto the screen .
“ What if you could go straight to the happiness ? ”
The visitors watched raptly , scribbling in white binders and drinking from bottles of Sparkletts water .
Later , after Italian food at the Palms hotel , the group repaired to the Playboy Club .
As bored - looking Bunnies stood stiffly against pounding hip - hop music , James was having trouble finding the happiness .
“ Steph , my ex-girlfriend — she up and left me , ” he told Hsieh , who was standing near the bar , sipping a vodka - and - soda through a straw .
“ We ’d just bought a car together and everything . ”
“ Well , what if you thought of a relationship as a corporation ? ” Hsieh said .
“ Have you tested this , Tony ? ” James asked .
“ No , this is theoretical .
This is taking a logical approach .
But it ’s an interesting thing about companies and relationships .
Maybe the only thing that keeps you together is the core values . ”
James proposed that perhaps in the future Zappos might start an online dating service , like Match.com or eHarmony .
Hsieh shrugged and said , “ Sure , why not ? ”
“ ZHarmony , ” James said , with a hollow laugh .
“ Happiness in a box ! ”
The next morning , Hsieh met me in a small , colorful conference room nicknamed the Aladdin , for the casino .
He was holding a can of sugar - free Red Bull in his left hand and a can of Pepsi One in his right .
“ I ’ve always been a night owl — I never want to go to sleep , ” he said .
“ It ’s so hard to wake up . ”
He had on a T - shirt printed with the company ’s logo — a graphic shoeprint — faded blue jeans , and black sneakers .
When asked what brand the shoes were , he gestured helplessly and replied , “ Just . . . sneakers . ”
Hsieh ’s success in the fetishized retail category of shoes is curious because of his utter disengagement from the product ; when he talks about “ platforms , ” he is referring to a business framework , not to thick soles .
As an undergraduate computer - science major , he worked as a software engineer for BBN Technologies , the company that , in the seventies , put the @ in e-mail .
“ I ’ve never been into shoes — and I ’m still not , ” he said .
Zappos has begun to expand from shoes , as Amazon did from its base of books , into other categories of merchandise : handbags , clothes .
“ Kitchenware , housewares , whatever , ” Hsieh said .
But he ’s not really interested in those things , either .
“ I much prefer experiences to stuff , ” he said .
Hsieh drives a modest black Mazda 6 .
He used to go to raves ; now he watches movies for fun .
“ I loved ‘ Adaptation , ’ ” he said .
( Zappos Core Value No. 2 : Embrace and Drive Change . )
His one apparent indulgence is a baronial new house in the Southern Highlands , a gated golf community ( although he does not play golf ) .
It contains a panelled library with well - stocked , floor - to - ceiling bookshelves ; a billiard room ; and a pool , around which little puffs of mist hydrate the landscaping at regular intervals .
This past Fourth of July , as the Amazon deal was percolating behind closed doors , he held a party for employees , with water guns .
“ Less raucous than usual , ” the shuttle driver with the busted - up marriage reported .
( When I told Hsieh what the bus driver had said about her divorce , he remarked , “ Maybe they were n’t the right fit and should n’t have gotten married in the first place .
But Zappos helped open their eyes .
Like Plato ’s Cave . ” )
Each of his house ’s five bedrooms , like the office conference rooms , is themed to a glossy Vegas hotel : the Mirage , Circus Circus .
The master suite is a close replica of a room at the minimalist W : black and gray and silver , down to a pillow on the bed emblazoned with the word “ Wish . ”
There is a walk - in closet filled with shirts and slacks , and one suit , which Hsieh said he shares with a brother and wears only to weddings .
He lives alone , aside from a stray calico cat with matted fur , which he has named El Gato and sometimes feeds .
“ Not mine , ” he stressed .
In this isolated pleasure dome , littered with Gatorade bottles and pizza boxes , he seems to be evading traditional adult value systems , living in a sort of suspended collegiate state .
( In a letter to Zappos employees about the Amazon deal , he compared his feelings about the sale to those he experienced on graduation day . )
“ I had this weird recurring dream where for some reason I just forgot that I had a place in New York , like an apartment or something , but it was a very cool place , like the W , and I tried to go visit it , ” he said .
“ But I did n’t have the key , I did n’t have anything I needed . ”
In the private sector , there is always a test of success .
The business must make a profit .
It can sustain some losses but the clock is always running on those .
At some point , after all cuts have been made and costs are trimmed to a minimum , the business has to close shop .
The summer of losses must become the autumn of profits , or else it ’s all over .
Not so in government .
Failing projects can go on forever .
There is no profit and loss test .
There is no test at all , in fact .
Agencies like the GAO can blast away at a particularly egregious case of government waste , but hardly anyone pays attention .
Congress has no reason to scrap it .
No one does .
Taxpayers have no means to pull the plug , because the whole thing is run outside their purview .
Now , with an intro like that , you might think I ’m about to talk about Medicare or public schools or the post office .
It would be easy enough .
But let us never forget that foreign policy constitutes another sector of government management , central planning , and bureaucratic - driven missions that are no more or less successful than anything else a government does .
The case in question here is the Afghan invasion and occupation .
The top military commander there , Gen. Stanley A. McChrystal , has written a report ( supposed to be secret but emailed to the Washington Post ) that says unless more troops arrive soon , the entire operation will fail .
They wo n’t be able to defeat the insurgency unless more force is applied .
That ’s a serious problem , since it is not unreasonable to define the current and would - be insurgency as the entire population of Afghanistan , perhaps excepting those directly on the US payroll .

How well do I recall that first American foray into Afghanistan following September 11 , 2001 .
The US just had to kill someone and soon .
The Islamic hardcores running that country made a good target , especially since the average American doubts that anyone in such a far - flung country , where people dress funny and believe crazy things , is up to any good at all .
Let ’s go get ’em !
There was hardly any opposition .
Oh sure , there were a few of us out there .
But mostly , everyone went along , as if this were a case of dispensing justice and , after all , that ’s what government is supposed to do , according to its own storyline .
So far as I know , all D.C. think tanks got on board with that one .
It was the least objectionable war of the modern period , the one that almost no one opposed .
Never mind that the precise relationship between 9 - Eleven and Afghanistan was fuzzy at best .
Never mind that the secret hideouts of the alleged terrorists there were built by the US itself during the days of the Soviet occupation .
The basis of the attack was not that different from the attack on Iraq : it was something that the Bush administration wanted and 9 - Eleven furnished the pretext .

Would it succeed ?
Anyone with a sense of history knows the answer to that .
The British tried and failed .
The Soviets tried and failed .
The only way a person could believe that the US would succeed is if you believed that the US is somehow a country of magic power .
After the invasion , the Taliban fled — very smart — and went into the hills to have years of fun with us , and so on it has gone .
But the General ’s report ca n’t even recognize the failure : " While the situation is serious , success is still achievable . "
Oh sure , and if we keep following this rainbow , we ’ll find a pot of gold at the end .
We just have to keep walking and following the General .
People talk of the need for an exit strategy .
A more serious problem for government is the exit motivation .
So long as failed programs continue , everyone on the payroll loves it .
The bureaucrats have power .
The money rolls in .
The Congress can pass out the contracts .
The corporations in league with the warfare state get contracts and infrastructure development .
The state gets to show force and muscle people .
What ’s not to love ?
The costs are borne by others , such as Americans who pay in taxes and inflation , and such as average Afghans who live amidst chaos and fear , and who stand little chance of experiencing normal lives so long as their country is used as a pawn in international politics .
The resentments that are built up during times of occupation last for many generations , and the US will pay a long and heavy price .
But failure ?
The US will never admit it .
The answer now , is as it was under Bush and will be forever with government programs , is more force , more death , more money , more determination to win .
The private sector ca n’t do this , which is precisely why all the stuff that makes life worth living is produced privately , and all that the government does is slow down the progress of civilization and bring destruction and disaster wherever it goes .

Q : What type of health insurance do members of Congress receive ?
Is it a single - payer , government - run system ?
A : Until 2014 , members of Congress were covered by private insurance under the same system that covers all federal workers .
FULL ANSWER
( Note : This item is no longer current .
It was accurate at the time it was written in 2009 , when the Affordable Care Act was being debated .
But starting Jan. 1 , 2014 , House and Senate members , and their staffs , can only obtain employer - subsidized , private coverage through the exchanges established under the ACA .
The exchanges , or marketplaces , were designed for those who purchase their own insurance and small employers .
For a full discussion of current health insurance options for members of Congress , see the 2015 Congressional Research Service paper “ Health Benefits for Members of Congress and Designated Congressional Staff . ”
Over the years , we ’ve seen false claims that Congress was somehow “ exempt ” from the health care law .
But , in fact , the law places this additional requirement on Congress that does n’t pertain to other Americans with employer - provided health care . )
Members of Congress have good health insurance by any standard , but it ’s not free and not reserved only for them – and it ’s not government insurance .
House and Senate members are allowed to purchase private health insurance offered through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program , which covers more than 8 million other federal employees , retirees and their families .
It ’s not a “ single - payer ” system where the government acts as the one and only health insurance company .
As President Bush ’s chief of personnel Kay Coles James said in 2003 , while lecturing at the conservative Heritage Foundation , “ the FEHB program is not centralized , government - run health care . ”
It has drawn praise both from conservatives and liberals , including President Obama , who held it up as a model for his own health care proposals .
According to the Congressional Research Service , the FEHBP offers about 300 different private health care plans , including five government - wide , fee - for - service plans and many regional health maintenance organization ( HMO ) plans , plus high - deductible , tax - advantaged plans .
All plans cover hospital , surgical and physician services , and mental health services , prescription drugs and “ catastrophic ” coverage against very large medical expenses .
There are no waiting periods for coverage when new employees are hired , and there are no exclusions for preexisting conditions .
The FEHBP negotiates contracts annually with all insurance companies who wish to participate .
There is plenty of competition for the business ; FEHBP is the largest employer - sponsored health plan in the U.S .
Those who do n’t like their coverage may switch to another plan during a yearly “ open season ” period .
To help with the choices , FEHBP conducts an annual “ satisfaction survey ” of each plan with more than 500 members and publishes the results .
Like other large employers , the government pays a large share of the cost of coverage .
On average , the government pays 72 percent of the premiums for its workers , up to a maximum of 75 percent depending on the policy chosen .
For example , the popular Blue Cross and Blue Shield standard fee - for - service family plan carries a total premium of $ 1,327.80 per month , of which the beneficiary pays $ 430.04 .
Washington , D.C. - based employees who prefer an HMO option might choose the Kaiser standard family plan .
It carries a total premium of $ 825.15 per month , of which the employee pays only $ 206.29 .
In addition , members of Congress also qualify for some medical benefits that ordinary federal workers do not .
They ( but not their families ) are eligible to receive limited medical services from the Office of the Attending Physician of the U.S. Capitol , after payment of an annual fee ( $ 491 in 2007 ) .
But services do n’t include surgery , dental care or eyeglasses , and any prescriptions must be filled at the member ’s expense .
House and Senate members ( but not their families ) also are eligible to receive care at military hospitals .
For outpatient care , there is no charge at the Washington , D.C. , area hospitals ( Walter Reed Army Medical Center and National Naval Medical Center ) .
Inpatient care is billed at rates set by the Department of Defense .
Update , Aug. 6 , 2012 : This item was updated to reflect the employee share of the monthly insurance premiums for 2012 .

Why ladies are more likely to fall for a lookalike
They say that opposites attract .
Well they are probably wrong , according to scientists .
A study has found that women are most attracted to men who look just like them .
The results could go some way to explaining what drew stars such as David and Victoria Beckham , Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes , and Johnny Depp and Vanessa Paradis to each other in the first place .
The University of St Andrews psychologists found that women preferred men who were masculine - looking but also had features that resembled their own .
Were these celebrity couples drawn to each other because of their similar looks ?
David and Victoria Beckham , Tom Cruise and Katie Holmes , Johnny Depp and Vanesa Paradis , and Kelly Osbourne and Luke Worrell
It is thought that facial resemblance might help to cancel out any issues of mistrust that women normally associated with strong masculine characteristics .
The research , which is published this week by the scientific journal Behavioural Ecology , used computer digital techniques to manipulate men's faces and show them to 60 women .
Faces were made to look more or less masculine , and more or less like the woman looking at the picture .
The women rated the faces for attractiveness .
The study was carried out by Tamsin Saxton , a postdoctoral research fellow funded by the Economics and Social Research Council , based at the University 's School of Psychology .
She said the women were more likely to pick a man with similar characteristics to themselves .
She said : ' Previous research has often found that women can be attracted to masculine men , but also a bit suspicious of them .
' However , women tend to trust men more if they look like them .
So perhaps the resemblance cancelled out the women 's suspicions .
' Or maybe the women felt they were better matched with men who looked like them , because if two people resemble each other , they might both be attracted to each other . '
The study , which is part of an ongoing research programme , was carried out in collaboration with the University of Liverpool .
Last year scientists at St Andrews discovered that women go for men with more feminine features , such as Depp or Leonardo DiCaprio , because they suggest the type of man who will settle down .
But men prefer women with large eyes and lips like Angelina Jolie - because they think they will be more promiscuous and be up for a one - night stand .
Groups of men and women in their 20s were shown photographs of potential partners and asked to judge whether the person wanted a fling or a serious relationship .

Do not go out to Governors Island looking for it !
Today , I finally got on the ferry and went out to Governors Island .
For you non-New Yorkers , Governors Island is an island located just south of Manhattan and was once used as a military base .
An entire complex of buildings , including forts , churches , and army barracks , still remains in excellent condition on the island .
Off limits for years , the island has recently been opened up to the public , with free ferries from Manhattan and Brooklyn .
I ca n’t recommend it enough : wander the grounds , have a picnic , bike the perimeter , and take in some beautiful views of southern Manhattan .
Though there ’s a lot to write about , I wanted to focus on something that was simply too amazing to believe : an archaeological dig currently in the process of unearthing an entire town buried beneath Governors Island .
Since January , Belgian archaeologists have been working strenuously to excavate the ruins of a former Governors Island hamlet called Goverthing ( a bastardization of a Dutch word ) .
With a 400 year history dating back to Manhattan ’s first settlements , the hamlet was the last civilian colony on Governors Island by the 1950’s .
In 1954 , the town was forcibly evacuated by the city of New York , who had deemed it a safety hazard for a variety of reasons , and effectively had it condemned .
As demolition was not an option at the time , the hamlet was simply buried under tens of feet of soil and forgotten .
The town was recently rediscovered accidentally by contractors conducting demolition work on the site to build a park , which has since been canceled in favor of a full excavation of Goverthing .
A tour costs $ 5 , and I definitely recommend seeing the incredible work they ’ve done in person .
The site is only open through October 11 , after which it will be closed for further excavation work .
As you first walk in , you ’ll first see the top of the town ’s former water tower sticking out of the dirt :
Incredibly , the well beneath it still runs to this day .
For this public exhibit , the excavators have attached a make - shift pump to draw water up – and it works !
You can try it when you visit and see a stream of water pouring out :
As you walk along , you ’ll see the tops of rusted power line towers poking up from the ground , cables still attached :
One can only imagine how deep into the ground they must go :
Detail :
The centerpiece of the excavation site is the town church ( note the chimneys of what are most likely former residences in the foreground ) :
I really wish I had taken notes on the history of Goverthing while I was there – it seems to be a bit hard to find any information at all online , for some reason .
Apparently , the original weathervane has been removed to protect it from the elements and can be seen in the history exhibit indoors .
The archaeologists have removed a stained - glass window from one side of the steeple to allow entry to the belfry .
A complex system of bells and chimes can be operated manually , still in full working order :
As you walk the grounds , you start to notice more and more chimneys poking out of the dirt , waiting to be unearthed :
Some even have antennas still attached ( remember , it was the 1950s when the town was buried , and you needed to get reception somehow back then ! ) :
Another chimney :
This chimney still has a weathervane attached …
… though it is in a sad state of deterioration from the elements :
Another chimney :
You also start to notice street lights as you move to what must have been the town ’s center :
Another streetlight .
It ’s frankly fascinating to think of yourself perched so high up over the remnants of a former town :
According to one of the archaeologists that was on site to answer questions , there was a single factory in town during the 1900 ’s , which manufactured snowglobes ( I erroneously reported it as a snow factory , and was corrected by several readers ) :
The top of two factory chimneys – you can still see “ SNO ” written on the left one .
Also note the two smaller towers in front :
One says “ SNOW ” ( love the dripped paint ) :
The other says “ WATER . ” I ’d love to someday take a tour of the snow factory , and hope it is fully unearthed by next summer .
Perched in the center of the factory roof is this man , who I can only imagine founded the snowglobe factory .
He holds a snowglobe which I believe contains a miniature version of himself inside .
Ancient birds nests still dot the factory arch .
1950 ’s birds nests ?
As you make your way along , more significant progress has been made in excavating …
… including a fully exposed gas station :
Two gas pumps lie half - buried out front :
I love the colors and the mechanics on this one …
I also like this one , though I ’m not sure how it pumped gas with only a moviola flip book inside :
I also love the 1950 ’s curves and angles of the gas station entrance :
Inside , the station is in reasonable shape …
… and even features a fully functioning jukebox !
On the side of the gas station …
… are these bizarre devices , which I can only imagine were phones ( remember , it was the 1950 ’s , and phone technology was primitive at best back then ) :
Finally , as you are walking out , you ’ll pass several cars , half - exposed and in a sad state :
Another car .
Amazing the city would simply bury them in , and not sell them at auction or something .
I had an excellent time wandering the excavation site and learning about the history of Goverthing , easily as thrilling as the time I paid to see the Feejee Mermaid , and I hope it re-opens to the public someday soon .
Follow - up note :
This was actually an art installation , since removed .
Sadly , there is no buried town on Governors Island .

There seem to be more and more anti-GMO ( genetically modified organisms -- foods ) enthusiasts protesting against genetic engineering every day .
The fear is that their release is premature because we do not know how they will affect our health .
Many are also just ethically apposed to them .
I support the protest against GMO ’s , but what are we really achieving during this fight ?
We need to start focusing on making small victories .
These small victories are the conservation of genetic diversity through protecting Heritage and Heirloom seeds .
Why is maintaining Heritage and Heirloom seeds important ?
Genetic diversity within species of plants is like insurance .
One variety may be tolerant to a disease while another is not , or insects may find one species desirable and another undesirable .
Genetic diversity increases the variables for the survival of the species .
Imagine we decided to only grow one variety of pepper and a virus came along and wiped out all of the pepper crops ?
Imagine an entire season without peppers or an entire season without various vegetables !
We now ship food globally so this is an unlikely scenario , however an incident such as this could drastically reduce the supply of certain foods , which could affect everyone , nutritionally speaking .
This is why protecting Heritage and Heirloom seeds should be important to everyone .
Blight among plants is just as unpredictable as viruses and flu among humans .
They are always changing so we can never know exactly what we will be resistant to and what we need to protect ourselves from .
For example the flu shot protects us from a small number of flu’s that are predicted to be dominant during the next flu season .
The flu shot does not protect us from every possible flu virus .
There is also still much to be learned about phytochemicals and how they affect our health .
Different plants provide different amounts and combinations of phytochemicals .
By reducing the number of available fruit and vegetable varieties we could be reducing access to phytochemicals that have valuable health benefits .
We need as many people growing and protecting Heirloom and Heritage seeds as possible because crops can be contaminated by the pollen of sterile hybrid and / or GMO crops .
There have been situations where farmers ' crops have been contaminated by GMO pollen .
I recall one particular situation where a wheat farmer was sued because the pollen from a nearby GMO crop contributed a patented gene to the farmer ’s wheat .
Therefore he was ordered to destroy the crop .
Since the entire crop had to be destroyed , he lost the wheat seed that had been grown by his family for generations .
This is how Heritage seed varieties can become extinct .
If people grow seed varieties in a vast array of locations , the seeds will be better protected against unwelcome contamination and the plants will also evolve and adapt to different habitats .
Two great non-profit organizations that protect Heirloom and Heritage seeds are The Seed Savers Exchange and Native Seeds / SEARCH .
The Seed Savers Exchange produces a Seed Savers Yearbook “ which contains names and addresses of 900 members and 6,000 listings of rare vegetable and fruit varieties that they are offering to other gardeners ” ( http://www.care2.com/greenliving/why-buy-heirloom-plants-seeds.html#).
Those who are interested in obtaining seeds can simply write to the members who have listed the varieties .
The Native Seeds / SEARCH is focused on growing Heritage and Heirloom varieties in their native habitats , specifically in the U.S. Southwest Northwest Mexico .
They distribute these seeds to home gardeners and give them to Native American farmers ( http://www.care2.com/greenliving/why-buy-heirloom-plants-seeds.html#).

The Obama administration will loan Fisker Automotive more than half a billion dollars to bring the super - luxe Karma plug - in hybrid to market and develop an " affordable " plug - in that could be on the road as early as 2012 .
The California startup said most of the $ 528.7 million low - interest loan will help finance project Nina , a four - door , five - passenger mid-size plug - in hybrid that will build on the technology underpinning the gas-electric Karma .
Whereas the Karma ( pictured above ) will start at $ 87,900 when it goes on sale next year , the Nina is expected to cost $ 39,900 after the $ 7,500 federal tax credit for EVs and plug - in hybrids .
" This conditional loan represents a significant step in America ’s future , ” company CEO Henrik Fisker said in a statement .
“ With it Fisker Automotive can rapidly develop affordable clean cars that satisfy our passion for driving and help restore the U.S. as an auto industry leader . ”
According to the Department of Energy , which will provide the loan , Fisker will receive $ 169.3 million for engineering integration costs on the Karma .
The cash also will help pay for designing the tooling and equipment needed to build the car , which will be assembled in Finland by Valmet , a contract builder that has done work for the likes of Saab and Porsche .
Durability testing of the 67 - mpg Karma is now underway , and cold - weather testing will begin this winter in Finland .
The remainder of the loan will finance further development of Nina , which will be built in the United States .
Fisker has said he could have the car on the road 29 months after receiving the loan , and the company said today we could see the car by 2012 .
As ambitious as that timeline is , it pales next to the numbers Fisker is talking about .
The nascent automaker , which has raised $ 170 million in venture capital from the likes of Kleiner Perkins Caufiled & Byers , says it expects global sales to " exceed 100,000 units annually . "
Henrik
Fisker made the same claim when we interviewed him last month , and said it would happen within five years .
Moving that many cars a year would make his company larger than Porsche .
“ We can definitely carve out that sector , " he told us .
The Karma , like the Chevrolet Volt , uses electricity to drive the wheels and a 2.0 - liter turbocharged engine ( pictured at right ) to keep the electric motors turning once the 22 kilowatt - hour lithium - manganese Enerdel battery runs down .
Propulsion comes from a pair of electric motors that deliver a total of 403 horsepower — and 959 pound - feet of torque — to the rear wheels .
Fisker Automotive claims the car has a range of 50 miles .
Fisker is n't saying much about the Nina , but told us the car will fall between the BMW 3 - Series and 5 - Series in terms of size and it will feature “ very radical ” styling .
It also will used a stamped steel frame and body panels ( the Karma is aluminum ) to save money .
Fisker is the fourth automaker to receive a loan under the $ 25 billion Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Program .
The loans are meant to help automakers offset the cost of retooling factories to build eco-friendlier cars that are at least 25 percent more fuel - efficient than 2005 models .
Tesla Motors received $ 465 million in June to help develop the Model S , a mid-sized sedan the company claims will cost $ 49,000 after the $ 7,500 tax credit .
Ford and Nissan also have received loans .
Fisker and the Department of Energy said the loan will create or preserve as many as 5,000 jobs .
" This investment will create thousands of new American jobs and is another critical step in making sure we are positioned to compete for the clean energy jobs of the future , ” Energy Secretary Steven Chu said in a statement announcing the Fisker loan .
“ Plug - in hybrid electric vehicles could revolutionize personal transportation and cut our dependence on foreign oil , not to mention give us cleaner air and less carbon pollution . ”
The agency said more loans will be announced in the months to come .

( CNN ) --
He has been captured by bank surveillance cameras in four states , sneering and holding a pistol sideways during heists .
The FBI is searching for this suspect , who they say has robbed at least 10 banks in the South .
Now authorities hope to catch the serial bank robber by plastering his image on electronic billboards throughout the South .
The FBI is searching for the suspect , who they say has robbed at least 10 banks in Kentucky , North Carolina , South Carolina and Tennessee .
The brazen bandit has been captured in surveillance footage sporting the same close - cropped hairstyle and goatee in many of the holdups .
He does not seem to make any effort to cover his face and sometimes is seen aiming a handgun sideways , showing his tattoos on both forearms as he gestures at bank employees .
" It is uncommon to come in to a bank and show his face like he does , " said FBI agent Kevin Keithley .
Watch how the FBI hunts bank robbers »
The FBI has tracked the bank robber 's path on a map that crisscrosses the southern United States .
The billboards that went up Monday roughly follow the path that the bank robber took , the FBI said .
The billboards are in Alabama , Kentucky , Georgia , North Carolina , South Carolina , Tennessee , Virginia and West Virginia , the FBI said in a statement .
Do n't Miss WSPA : Local coverage
His odyssey has spanned more than 600 miles north , from Charleston , South Carolina , to Louisville , Kentucky , and about 500 miles east , from Knoxville , Tennessee , to Edenton , North Carolina .
The robberies started in May and the most recent one was last week in Tennessee , Keithley said .
The suspect is described as white , about 25 years old , 5 feet 9 to 5 feet 11 , 170 to 175 pounds .
He has short , reddish - brown hair and an unshaven goatee , the FBI said .
The suspect has not yet harmed anybody in the robberies but the FBI considers him extremely dangerous .
" This guy has made no effort to hide the gun , " Keithley said .
" He has threatened the use of it in every bank robbery he has committed .
He has put the gun in the faces of tellers , threatened to use the gun against them .
So we want to get this guy in custody before he harms anyone . "
In surveillance video of a robbery in Fletcher , North Carolina , the suspect is seen talking into a handheld radio , said an FBI official involved in the investigation .
In a South Carolina robbery , a wireless phone device is seen on his ear .
" That prompted us to look at the prospect of another suspect out there helping him , and we continue to look for that angle but have no leads into that as of now , " the FBI official said .
Authorities are also working with police agencies , corrections departments and others who use facial recognition technology , the official said , and are working with corrections departments on tattoo identifications , recorded by prisons in some states .
Since the national billboard program began in 2008 , the billboards have been directly responsible for the apprehension of at least 20 fugitives , said Stephen Emmett , spokesman for the FBI 's Atlanta office .
" We try to reserve the billboards for the more mobile , more egregious , violent offenders , because we understand we 're pulling resources away from a corporate entity , and we try not to take advantage of that , " he said .
" But they are a very valuable tool to law enforcement in these type of cases where the individual is highly mobile and very dangerous . "
The bank robbery suspect has distinctive tattoos on his forearms , Emmett noted .
" Somebody will recognize these tattoos .
Somebody will recognize this individual .
The remarkable thing about this serial bank robber is that he did not attempt whatsoever to disguise himself .
The photographs from these cases are very good , very detailed .
The public will know who this individual is . "
He said his past experience , as well as statistics , show that " there are addiction issues with the majority of these bank robbers , and that provides a bad additional ingredient to this bank robbery scenario .
You have an individual going into a bank with a gun , in a reckless manner , and now he might actually be on drugs and strung out on drugs .
So that makes this even more imperative , to get this individual off the street before anybody gets hurt and to get him the help that he needs . "
Robbing banks is not as lucrative as the public might believe , he said , and " with addiction - type motives by these robbers , they tend to get only enough money to get their next fix . "
It 's possible the suspect 's family members may not know of his activities , Emmett said .
" He 's an individual that we want off of the street in the worst way , " he said , " and we feel these billboards are a tool .
We feel the photographs from the banks are going to make that happen . "
The FBI asks anybody who knows the bank robber or who has information in the case to call 423-282-8090 .
A reward is being offered .

Judith Warner on the politics of everyday life .
Barbara Ehrenreich is now the latest to weigh in on the Female Happiness Conundrum — the whole cultural brouhaha caused by the news from Wharton School professors Betsey Stevenson and Justin Wolfers earlier this year that despite all the objective improvements to their lives over the past four decades , women today appear to be less happy than they were in 1972 .
It ’s been a hot - button issue , this most recent iteration of Freud ’s too - often - repeated question about what women want .
The whole declining happiness thing has been spun into an indictment of feminism ( the “ triumphant : I told you so ” as Ehrenreich puts it ) , sparking an angry response that those who claim women are unhappy post - feminism are nothing more than agents of an anti-woman backlash .
That accusation is often correct .
But not necessarily in Stevenson and Wolfers ’s case .
Wolfers defended himself in The New York Times ’ Freakonomics blog last week , arguing that his and Stevenson ’s study is n’t the only one to show declining female happiness since the 1970s .
He and Stevenson further admit , in the course of their paper , that their numbers really do n’t tell us anything clear about why women now report being more unhappy , only that they do .
And whether that increased reporting of lesser happiness actually corresponds to a decline in lived happiness is another question that Stevenson and Wolfers are very open in admitting they can’t answer .
I appreciate this .
I tend to have a problem with studies that measure nebulous emotional states and then compare them back to other nebulous states experienced at different moments in time .
You learn a lot from them about how people answer surveys , but not so much about how they objectively felt .
Happiness , after all , is hard to quantify ; you ca n’t measure it in a blood test , or map it in a mathematical equation corresponding to patterns of neuronal activity in the brain .
It also tends to be relative ; we judge our happiness , at least in part , against our expectations of how we are supposed to feel and how good we think life is supposed to be .
These inner “ supposed ”s may well have changed for women since the early 1970s , as Stevenson and Wolfers more or less say , in fancier language .
They suggest that the opening up , diversifying and expanding of women ’s sphere of existence may have given them more things to potentially be unhappy about : “ … the increased opportunities available to women may have increased what women require to declare themselves happy . ”
Entering the world of men may very well have raised the bar of expectations : “ If happiness is assessed relative to outcomes for one ’s reference group , ” they write , “ then greater equality may have led more women to compare their outcomes to those of the men around them .
In turn , women might find their relative position lower than when their reference group included only women . ”
In other words : if you expect less for yourself , you ’re easier to please .
The early 1970s was a limiting time for women , but it was also , perhaps , a hopeful time .
There was definitely a feeling in the air that women ’s lives were changing in a positive way .
There was a sense that everything was possible , that life for women was getting better , that if things had n’t yet come together as well as they should have , they inevitably would .
Down the line .
Like , today .
Life for women has not come together .
That , at least , is the very clear conclusion you have to draw after reading the essays contained in “ A Woman ’s Nation Changes Everything , ” a book - length report released this week by the Center for American Progress .
Despite its cheery - sounding title , the report conveys a bleak portrait of women ’s non-progress in our day .
The wage gap persists , particularly for mothers , who now earn 73 cents for every man ’s dollar .
Our workforce and education system is still sex - segregated , operating along generations - old stereotypes that steer most women into low - paid , low - status , low - security professions .
Women pay more for health insurance than men , have more extensive health needs than men , and suffer unique forms of discrimination in their coverage .
( Women may be denied coverage because they had a Caesarean delivery or were victims of domestic violence — both “ preexisting conditions . ” )
Regardless of the number of hours they work , they continue to do far more caretaking and housekeeping work at home than do their husbands .
And discrimination against mothers ( but not fathers ) in the workplace is all but ubiquitous .
These are not happy - making developments .
And they ’re not failures of feminism .
They are instead indicators of all the ways in which society has failed women , most importantly — and this comes up time and time again , in every section of the report — by failing to address the needs of working families .
“ What actually is troubling the American female population ? ” Susan Faludi asked in her 1991 best - seller “ Backlash , ” at another moment when much antifeminist hay was being made out of reports of female unhappiness .
“ In public opinion surveys , women consistently rank their own inequality , at work and at home , among their most urgent concerns . ”
Eighteen years later , this observation is just as true , and the limitations thrown in the way of women ’s progress even more glaring .
“ If the women ’s movement raised women ’s expectations faster than society was able to meet them , they would be more likely to be disappointed by their actual experienced lives , ” Stevenson and Wolfers write .
“ As women ’s expectations move into alignment with their experiences , this decline in happiness may reverse . ”
Let ’s hope that ’s never the case .
The progress that ’s been made toward women ’s equality , the many authors of “ A Woman ’s Nation ” consistently assert , have made most people happy .
The happiest marriages , the historian Stephanie Coontz reports in a chapter called “ Sharing the Load , ” are those in which a couple shares egalitarian values .
Men in today ’s world who have gone with the flow of changing roles and mores , the sociologist Michael Kimmel writes , are healthier , closer to their wives and children , happier and … having more sex .
And for more on how more ( male ) vacuuming equals more sex , see this in Wednesday ’s Wall Street Journal .
Freedom , opportunity , respect , dignity , self - determination and equality — those universal human rights we somehow judge optional for women — do not make people unhappy .
Only roadblocks to those entitlements do .
Particularly when those impediments are packaged as what we “ really ” want .
The developers behind the open source GNOME desktop environment have announced the official release of version 2.28 .
This version brings a handful of noteworthy improvements such as a new Bluetooth configuration tool and user interface refinements in numerous applications .
One of the most significant changes is the adoption of Apple 's WebKit HTML rendering engine for GNOME 's Epiphany Web browser .
GNOME is a collection of software applications , development frameworks , and core desktop components that together provide a comprehensive graphical computing environment for Linux and other compatible operating systems .
It includes a file manager , a task management panel , a suite of basic utilities , and various programs for communication and multimedia .
It is the default desktop environment in several prominent Linux distributions , such as Ubuntu .
A new stable version arrives every six months with a handful of important incremental improvements that constitute a significant portion of the user - visible changes in subsequent GNOME - based Linux distro releases .
Bluetooth support got a major overhaul in this GNOME release .
The new gnome - bluetooth project , which is a fork of bluez - gnome , provides improved desktop integration and a much better user interface for managing connections with Bluetooth devices .
NetworkManager integration will simplify tethering , and PulseAudio integration will make it easier to fine - tune audio behavior for headsets .
The GNOME community has become increasingly enthusiastic about the WebKit rendering engine due to its potential for bringing richer presentation capabilities to the desktop and a stronger Web browsing experience .
Adoption of the GTK +
WebKit port was previously held back by accessibility concerns and general lack of maturity .
In GNOME 2.28 , these issues have largely been addressed .
Preliminary support for screen readers is now in place and the renderer is a lot more robust than it was six months ago .
This has opened the door for WebKit to be used in various parts of the GNOME desktop .
The Empathy instant messaging application has gained support for using Adium themes with a WebKit - powered message view .
More significantly , WebKit has displaced Mozilla 's Gecko engine as the HTML renderer in GNOME 's native Epiphany Web browser .
This transition has been in the works for quite some time and is a major step forward for GNOME 's browser .
Epiphany is quite snappy in GNOME 2.28 and scores 100/100 on the Acid3 test .
Using WebKit will help differentiate Epiphany from Firefox , which is shipped as the default browser by most of the major Linux distributors .
With the release of version 2.28 , GNOME has taken its first major steps towards delivering a location - aware desktop .
Some of the experimental geolocation features that we looked at earlier this year are now part of the desktop .
Empathy , for example , has gained a map view that can show you the location of your contacts using a new XMPP extension .
There are a lot of new little features too , such as an overview display for the Hamster time tracking tool and a PDF annotation tool for Evince , the GNOME PDF viewing utility .
The GNOME desktop is currently undergoing a significant transformation as the developers move closer towards unleashing the 3.0 release , which will offer a next - generation desktop shell and window manager .
The roadmap specifies that the next stable version , which is tentatively designated 2.30 , could potentially be declared the 3.0 release .
A lot of architectural work is being done under the hood to accommodate that transition , with deprecated legacy technologies such as Bonobo being purged aggressively throughout the desktop .
GNOME 2.28 represents a moderately compelling incremental improvement .
WebKit - based Epiphany is definitely worth a try , and I 'm finally starting to warm up to Empathy thanks to the bug fixing and user interface refinements delivered in this release .
The enhanced Bluetooth support is also a welcome addition .
Version 2.28 is a little bit light on new features relative to some previous GNOME releases , but that 's understandable as a lot of development effort is currently focused on preparing for the next - generation GNOME desktop .
For additional details about GNOME 2.28 , you can refer to the official release notes .
In August , Whole Foods CEO John Mackey argued in the pages of the Wall Street Journal that the solution to America 's health care crisis was to be found in " less government control and more individual empowerment . "
His own company 's unique health care plan , Mackey wrote , covers 90 percent of employees , costs less than health insurance plans , and provides a " very high degree of worker satisfaction . "
But for the sin of not supporting a government take over of health care , labor unions and left - wing activists called for a boycott of Whole Foods , claiming that Mackey 's solutions were unworkable and his employees were unhappy .
Reason.tv talked to protesters , Mackey , and employees about " the Whole Foods alternative to ObamaCare . "

Amazing pictures : Space Shuttle Discovery soars through the clouds before landing safely ( after a 2,000 mile diversion )
Advertisement
The space shuttle Discovery landed safely in California early today after bad weather forced a switch of its touchdown site at the end of a two - week mission to the International Space Station .
NASA diverted the spaceship to Edwards Air Force Base in California 's Mojave Desert after waiting in vain for two days for rain and clouds to clear over the shuttle 's home port in Florida , the originally scheduled landing location .
Under partly cloudy desert skies , the shuttle landed at 0053 GMT .
Con trails : Space Shuttle Discovery lands in the Mojave Deser at the NASA Dryden Flight Research Center on Edwards Air Force Base near Mojave , California
' Welcome home Discovery , congratulations on an extremely successful mission , ' astronaut Eric
Boe radioed from mission control to the crew as Discovery came to a stop .
Banking into its final landing approach visible from a whisp of twin contrails , Discovery first appeared from the ground as a white speck glinting in the fading sunlight high over the northeastern horizon .
The orbiter swiftly descended to the base 's main runway , a dull roar of aerodynamic drag growing louder , and touched down with a puff of smoke as the rear wheels made contact with the runway at a speed of 250 mph .
Just minutes before , double sonic booms thundered through the sky as Discovery dipped below the speed of sound for the first time since blasting off on August 28 , one minute before midnight , from the Kennedy Space Center in Florida on NASA 's 128th space shuttle mission .
Flight directors had tried on Thursday and Friday to bring Discovery back to Florida .
The STS - 128 was prevented from landing at the preferred site at the Kennedy Space Center by deteriorating weather on the east coast of Florida Magnificent :
The shuttle crew completed an 11 - day mission to repair and upgrade the Hubble Space Telescope
But rain and thunderstorms -- characteristic of Florida 's notoriously volatile weather -- stymied NASA 's original landing plans at the Kennedy Space Center , prompting flight directors to switch to the backup site at Edwards Air Force Base on the other side of the country , where skies were clearer .
' We 've had some weather challenges , but that 's life at the Florida home port , ' Mike Moses , NASA 's shuttle launch integration manager , told a post - landing news conference .
After 219 orbits around Earth , Discovery plunged back through the atmosphere , soaring northeast over the Pacific Ocean toward Southern California .
Commander Rick Sturckow circled Discovery down over the California desert , burning off speed before nose - diving the 100 - tonne ship to the concrete landing strip to complete a 5.7 - million mile journey .
Sturckow , pilot Kevin Ford , flight engineer Jose Hernandez , spacewalkers Danny Olivas and Christer Fuglesang , and astronaut Pat Forrester flew back to Earth with a new crew member , returning space station flight engineer Tim Kopra , who had been in orbit at the station for two months .
The space shuttle Discovery , lands on runway 22 at Edwards Air Force Base near Rosamond , California .
Engineers carry out a post - flight inspection
Kopra 's replacement , Nicole Stott , will remain on the space station until NASA returns to the outpost in November .
At nightfall at Edwards Air Force Base , nearly two hours after landing , six of Discovery 's returning astronauts emerged from a crew transport vehicle smiling and looking fit , then conducted a traditional walk - around inspection of the shuttle .
Kopra , feeling the effects of long - term weightlessness , missed the post - mission news conference to undergo some ' medical science experiments , ' Sturckow said in brief remarks .
' We 're very happy to be back on land here in California , ' the mission commander said .
' It was a great mission . '
NASA would have preferred to bring Discovery down in Florida to save the cost and trouble of having to transport the spaceship -- piggybacked on a larger plane -- back home from California .
But the Florida weather prevented this .
Discovery had carried more than 7.5 tonnes of food , laboratory equipment , science experiments , spare parts , a new treadmill and crew quarters for the space station .
The outpost is a $ 100 billion project involving 16 nations , which is nearing completion after more than a decade of construction .
NASA is turning over crew transport to the station to Russia , at a cost of about $ 50 million per seat , as it begins phasing out the shuttle .
The space agency is also considering hiring U.S. commercial firms to ferry its astronauts .
Olivas , Fuglesang -- a Swedish astronaut with the European Space Agency -- and Stott made three spacewalks during the mission .
NASA has six flights remaining to finish outfitting the station and then plans to move on with development of a capsule and rocket that could ferry crews to the moon .
Those plans may change as President Barack Obama considers the results of a study that has determined NASA 's lunar ambitions exceed its budget by about $ 3 billion a year .
Cutting taxes on low - alcohol drinks and tightening the hours when alcohol can be sold are among the ideas put forward in a review of New Zealand 's liquor laws .
The Law Commission today released its recommendations in a 279 - page report outlining a number of proposed initiatives aimed at curbing the problems fuelled by our booze culture .
" New Zealand has some serious problems with the use of alcohol which are detailed in this paper , " said Law Commission president Sir Geoffrey Palmer .
Suggestions put forward in the paper include :
* Introducing a split purchase for alcohol allowing young people to drink on a licensed premises from age 18 and to purchase from an off - licence from age 20 ;
* A completely new Sale of Liquor Act ;
* Measures aimed at curbing harmful drinking , such as reducing the availability of cheap drinks favoured by young and heavy drinkers ;
* Reducing excise tax on low - alcohol products to encourage their consumption over stronger drinks ;
* Reducing the hours within which alcohol can be bought ;
* Expanding the criteria under which a licence can be declined ;
* Expanding the range of conditions that can be imposed on licensees ;
* Introducing graduated licensing fees to ensure low risk operators are n't unfairly burdened .
Members of the public have three months , to the end of October , to make submissions .
Police Commissioner Howard Broad welcomed the review , saying that alcohol places a considerable strain on police resources and information about the misuse of alcohol was disturbing .
" Police recognise that legislation change is not the sole solution to reducing alcohol related harm , but we do consider that it is appropriate to be reviewing the legislation " Mr Broad said .
Mr Broad said alcohol was a key driver of offending and placed a considerable strain on police resources .
Police figures show :
* At least a third of all offenders apprehended by police have consumed alcohol prior to their arrest .
This rises to two - thirds of all offenders during the weekend period .
* Around half of all victims or offenders involved in a homicide are affected by alcohol .
* In 2007 / 8 police had to take over 21,000 people from public settings to places of safety due to their high levels of intoxication .
Many of these people end up in police cells until they sober up .
Mr Palmer said that while the Law Commission was " not advocating a return to wowserism " , the evidence suggested it was time to look at ways to curb the harmful effects of drinking to excess and curb the associated harm .
" That view has wide support .
It is supported by a range of highly credible groups , including judges , medical specialists and police , " he said .
The report suggested that heavy drinking and drunkenness were generating the most harm .
" We must achieve a balance between harm and consumer benefit flowing from the use of alcohol , " Mr Palmer said , adding that while not everyone drank to excess , the consequences of harmful drinking affected everyone .
The report highlighted the effects of alcohol use on criminal offending and on peoples ' health .
Mr Palmer said that a preliminary submission by District Court Judges estimated that up to 80 per cent of offenders had drug and alcohol problems .
He said this had highlighted the fact that there were not enough treatment programmes , something that also needed to be addressed .
" Alcohol is a contributing factor to a range of social harms .
Some of these are very visible , such as anti-social behaviour and aggression associated with intoxication in public places . "
He added that alcohol 's association with other problems - such as alcohol dependency and road fatalities - was less visible but potentially devastating .
The report also outlined strong new evidence suggesting that young people faced increased risk of both short - term and long - term harm from early and high - volume drinking .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
The Treasury Department , after missing an opportunity to rein in controversial bonuses to AIG employees last year , is now pressing the bailed out insurer to reduce a $ 198 million bonus pool , according to an overseer 's report released Tuesday .
Neil Barofsky , the special inspector general of the $ 700 billion bailout program , said that Treasury pay czar Kenneth Feinberg has recommended to AIG that the full $ 198 million not be paid out in full .
Feinberg has not yet made a specific recommendation to AIG about how much the insurer should reduce the payments , according to Barofsky .
Barofsky , in a report reviewing AIG 's bonuses , also said Treasury should have made a greater effort to understand the scope and scale of AIG 's bonuses .
Treasury instead deferred its oversight of AIG 's bonuses to the Federal Reserve , which gave AIG ( AIG , Fortune 500 ) the majority of its bailout , according to the report .
Barofsky , whose office was established by the Troubled Asset Relief Program , said Treasury failed not only to be " reasonably aware of challenges of a financial sort that could negatively impact taxpayers ' economic returns , but also obligations ... that could negatively impact the credibility of the TARP and Treasury itself . "
Treasury could have avoided the controversy that erupted in March 2009 when the public and Congress first learned about the bonuses , Barofsky said .
Treasury Secretary Tim Geithner learned of the bonuses just a week before they became public and endured much scrutiny for allowing the bonuses to be paid out .
" Treasury 's failure to discover the scope and scale of AIG 's executive compensation obligations , in particular at AIG Financial Products , potentially resulted in a missed opportunity to avoid the explosively controversial events , " said the report .
Treasury , in a response included in Barofsky 's report , said it welcomed the overseer 's comments .
It said it was already working to address the report 's critique and would implement recommendations such as doing a better job sharing information with other regulators .
Barofsky is due to testify before the House Oversight Committee on Wednesday at 10 a.m. ET about the report 's findings .
Controversial bonuses :
The most controversial of all the bonuses were $ 475 million in retention payments to employees of AIG 's Financial Products unit .
The Financial Products employees wrote insurance contracts , called credit default swaps on highly complex financial instruments like mortgage - backed securities .
The value of the underlying assets fell dramatically during the housing slump and led AIG to start hemorrhaging money in late 2007 .
The insurer posted nearly $ 100 billion of losses in 2008 .
The retention bonuses for the 400 employees of the Financial Products division were designed to keep the unit 's staff on board to wind down the company 's trillions of dollars in credit default swaps .
AIG scheduled the retention payments in three installments : $ 69 million in December 2008 , $ 168 million in March 2009 and $ 238 million to be paid in March 2010 .
But since many employees have left the company , $ 40 million of the final installment will not be paid out .
AIG has said it owes about $ 198 million to be paid by March 2010 .
AIG asked Feinberg to review the remaining retention payments due to the intense public scrutiny over them .
The company has argued that the payments are necessary to retain employees of the Financial Products unit who are uniquely qualified to take necessary steps to pay back the government .
Though Barofsky acknowledges that many Financial Products employees are needed to unwind AIG 's credit - default swap portfolio , the report also shows that bonuses were paid to non-essential personnel at the Financial Products unit , including $ 7,700 to a kitchen assistant , $ 700 to a file administrator and $ 7,000 to a mailroom assistant .
" AIG continues to discuss a variety of compensation issues with the Special Master , including future payments to employees of AIG Financial Products , " said Christina Pretto , spokeswoman for AIG .
" In the meantime , those employees are making considerable progress in unwinding trades and reducing risk at AIGFP . "
After the controversy escalated , AIG asked Financial Products employees who took home more than $ 100,000 in retention awards to give back half of their bonuses .
So far , AIG has gotten pledges to return $ 45 million , but has only gotten $ 19 million back .
" FP employees have until the end of the year to fulfill their commitments to return a portion of their March 2009 payment , " Pretto said .
" We expect FP employees will honor their commitments . "
Overly complicated : Barofsky 's report said that AIG is having trouble getting a handle on its own bonuses :
The company 's 2008 bonus structure was so complex that even AIG can't figure it out .
The company has roughly 630 separate compensation programs for bonuses , retention and deferred compensation totaling about $ 1.77 billion .
According to the report , AIG officials said the company does n't have an integrated data system .
Payroll data exists on 60 separate systems across the company .
Also , the company has 106,000 employees receiving compensation of some kind in 130 different countries -- each nation with their own regulations and restrictions on bonuses .
Liberalism and Socialism
In the comments section of this post is a debate over whether or not liberals are socialists .
I 'd like to leave you with the following quote from Winston Churchill which , I think , is exactly right .
Liberalism is not Socialism , and never will be .
There is a great gulf fixed .
It is not a gulf of method , it is a gulf of principle . [ � ]
Socialism seeks to pull down wealth .
Liberalism seeks to raise up poverty .
Socialism would destroy private interests ;
Liberalism would preserve private interests in the only way in which they can be safely and justly preserved , namely by reconciling them with public right .
Socialism would kill enterprise ; Liberalism would rescue enterprise from the trammels of privilege and preference [ � ]
Socialism exalts the rule ; Liberalism exalts the man .
Socialism attacks capital ; Liberalism attacks monopoly .

Discuss .
The only way that the White House can shift its strategy is with a huge outcry from us , and our going to townhalls this week to DEMAND that our Democratic lawmakers answer how the costs of private insurance can be lowered without essential cost containments such as Medicare drug price negotiation and the public option .
Because without these two elements as checks on private insurance companies , monthly premiums are going to rise unabated , and there would n't be real competition among these insurance companies in the national insurance exchange .
You know that might happen in the national insurance exchange without the public option ?
Right now , we have about six major insurance companies that dominate much of the country 's health insurance market in most states .
What 's going to happen to these six major insurance companies in the national insurance exchange ?
Will they really compete with each other ?
Or instead , buy each small insurance company up to the point that there are now six major insurance companies offering hundreds of different insurance plans within the national insurance exchange ?
That 's not real competition .
That wo n't bring down prices of your monthly premiums .
What it is is nothing more than a mandated bailout of the murder - by - spreadsheet industry with 45 million new captive customers .
When Americans do n't see the cost of their monthly premiums being lowered , you know who they 'll blame for not making health care reform affordable for them ?
The Democratic Party .
Sure , the insurance regulations are great .
So you 're stuck with an insurance company that can't drop you for pre-existing conditions , and can't rescind your policy if you get too sick .
However , your monthly premiums will continue to rise .
In the past year , there 's been a 20 % jump in the cost of monthly premiums , and that 's doubled almost with every year .
It 's an unsustainable situation for us financially without the public option .
You 'll have health insurance , but it wo n't be affordable .
Because if we allow the White House and the Senate moderates to give away the store to the insurance companies on the public option , you know what 's going to happen next ?
Subsidies would be pared back as the next starting point for conservatives .
And after the Democrats give in on subsidies to get " bipartisan " votes , the next starting point might be the community rating where the 2:1 requires that you as an adult , does n't pay more than twice the premiums of a young adult .
You know what 's in the Baucus " Fauc - Us " bill draft language from two months ago ?
A community rating of 7:1 .
That makes health insurance near unaffordable for most adults .
Here 's what we 're going to do on Monday .
We 'll be calling the White House to let them know that we find regional co-ops unacceptable , and that they would NOT lower the costs of health insurance for Americans !
We 'll let them know that the public option is the line in the sand for us , otherwise it 's a mandated bailout of the junk insurance industry with no real affordable options .
We 'll go to Democratic townhalls , ask our lawmakers to stand strong for the public option and the Medicare drug price negotiation because without these two essential provisions , there will be no cost containment on private insurance premiums .
We 'll point out that regional co-operatives are ineffective , and that Blue Cross Blue Shield once was a non-profit organization that got privatized , taken over , and premiums started to rise because of one factor : greed from the company board .
Where 's the assurance that the same wo n't be done to regional co-operatives ?
We 'll ask them to take the Pledge not to vote for any health care reform bill that does n't include the public option because without it , our monthly premiums will NOT be affordable .
And yes , we 'll be keeping up pressure on members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus to stand strong for the public option and not to cave in to the White House for a mandated bailout of the junk insurance industry !
We 'll be working very hard to make it clear to them just why regional co-operatives are unacceptable , and why the public option is an essential cost containment in health care reform .
We 'll ask them if they 're willing to vote for a mandated bailout of the insurance industry with no cost containment on our monthly premiums without the public option .
That is what we 'll be doing .
Lieberman Hires Republican Pollster
James Joyner · · 10 comments
Joe Lieberman ’s transformation into the quasi-Republican candidate for the U.S. Senate is nearly complete , now that he ’s hired the top Republican polling firm .
Sen .
Joe Lieberman continued retooling his campaign staff Friday , hiring a nationally known pollster and media consultant to assist in his independent re-election bid .
Lieberman hired Democratic consultant Josh Isay , who has worked for New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg , and Republican pollster Neil Newhouse , who lists popular Republican Gov. M. Jodi Rell among his clients .
“ They are not just among the best in their respective businesses , but they bring a deep knowledge of Connecticut from across the political spectrum , which will be essential to our effort to build a broad coalition of Democrats , Republicans , and independents , ” Lieberman said in a release .
Those of you who have followed my full disclosure notices are aware that my wife is a VP at POS ; those who have n’t are now .
The move is generating a little buzz .
TNR ’s Jason Zengerle links to POS ’ very long political client list and observes , “ You wo n’t find any Democrats . ”
Hotline ’s Chuck Todd adds ,
The more curious hiring , of course , is Newhouse , a partner in one of the most prestigious Republican polling firms in the country , Public Opinion Strategies .
On the merits , Newhouse is a great hire as he and his firm have one of the best reputations in the business , both with their clients and with the media , including us .
But what makes the hiring curious is that Newhouse is a Republican and has a slew of clients who will likely raise the ire of Democrats , particularly activist Democrats .
This cycle , Newhouse ’s most notable client is PA Sen.
Rick Santorum .
( Subscribers , click here of The Hotline ’s consultant scorecard . )
The Lieberman release , of course , makes no mention of Santorum , but does note Newhouse ’s client relationship with the very popular GOP CT Gov. Jodi Rell .
Newhouse is also the chief pollster for one of the Democrats ’ top House targets , CT 02 GOP Rep.
Rob Simmons .
In ’04 , the firm worked for the biggest Dem killer of the cycle , John Thune , who knocked off Tom Daschle .
And in ’ 02 , the firm ’s biggest name client ?
None other than a Bush , Jeb Bush , that is , in FL .
It ’s a surprising move , to be sure .
POS has a varied public policy clientele but , as far as I know , has been exclusively Republican in its political clients through its fifteen year history .
Then again , President Bush and RNC Chair Ken Mellman have all but endorsed Lieberman ’s candidacy .
Presumably , they ’ve made the calculation that they ’re not going to lose clients over this one .
With this and Santorum , they ’ve easily got the two most high profile races this season .
It ’ll make for an interesting three months .
UPDATE : Looking through my old posts to see what I ’ve written about Lieberman in the past ( 160 - odd posts mention him , probably putting him behind only 2004 nominee John Kerry among active Senators )
I came across this from December 2003 :
I feel sorry for Lieberman and think he ’s probably the Democrat currently in the race who is both most suited to govern and who would be the most appealing in the general election . *
But he sold his soul to be Al Gore ’s running mate , sacrificing much of his main selling point–integrity –in doing so .
And he got nothing in return .
The Democrat faithful still do n’t like him all that much and even Gore is n’t grateful .
Indeed , for a man who got elected to the Senate in part because of the active endorsement of National Review and the support of conservatives tired of Lowell Wiecker , it is somewhat ironic that he ’s come full circle : the only people who support him now are Republicans .
That seems more true now than then .
For example , SSP ’s James L. is positively apoplectic in a post entitled “ CT - Sen : Lieberman Hires Democrat Slayer ” ( Note to self : See if Neil already has this t- shirt . ) :
The most troubling bit about the news may rest in the fact that Newhouse ’s other Connecticut client is Rep. Rob Simmons , who is a top target of the DCCC and Joe Courtney .
Lieberman is now essentially using Republican tools , Republican capital , and Republican consultants to mobilize the same Republican voters that Courtney and the other Democratic challengers need to de-energize in order to win .
The pure gall of this move is disgusting , and it paints a sharp picture that Lieberman is for himself and himself only .
He does n’t care about electing three new Democrats to the House–he ’s more than willing to toss them overboard if it means he can work the Republican field and win .
I wonder how Lieberman ’s Senate Democratic colleagues feel now that they know that Lieberman is paying the same guy who ended the political careers of Tom Daschle and Max Cleland .
I wonder if they feel as good about letting Lieberman keep his seniority and committee assignments .
Or , maybe the Democrats should have re-nominated the 2000 VP candidate who helped make Florida a toss - up and who votes with the caucus 90 % of the time ?
UPDATE : Some discussion over at Crosstabs , although nothing yet from POS ’ Rob Autry .
Former POS ’er Bob Moran is laughing hysterically–or as much as one can in text form , anyway .
