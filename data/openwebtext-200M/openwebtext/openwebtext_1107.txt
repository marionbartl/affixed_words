Chuck Schumer 's $ 1.65 million take from the financial services industry is nearly twice than that of any other senator .
Wall Street money rains on Schumer
Wall Street has showered nearly $ 11 million on the Senate since the beginning of the year , and more than 15 percent of it has gone to a single senator : Democrat Chuck Schumer of New York .
Schumer ’s $ 1.65 million take from the financial services industry is nearly twice that of any other senator 's — and more than five times what the industry gave to any single Republican senator .

While the industry has scaled back its political spending in the wake of last year ’s economic collapse , data from the Center for Responsive Politics show that it ’s still investing heavily in the Senate , where it ’s likely to have its best shot at stopping — or at least shaping — the crackdown on Wall Street that President Barack Obama has proposed .
And it ’s clearly looking to Democrats to do it .
Of the $ 10.6 million the industry has given to sitting senators this year , more than $ 7.7 million has gone to Democrats .
Schumer got his $ 1.65 million ; his New York colleague Kirsten Gillibrand took in $ 886,000 ; Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid of Nevada received $ 814,000 ; Senate Banking Committee Chairman Chris Dodd of Connecticut scored $ 603,000 ; Colorado freshman Michael Bennet got $ 401,000 ; and Agriculture Committee Chairman Blanche Lincoln of Arkansas — who will have a big say on the derivatives portion of regulatory reform — got $ 336,000 .
“ Democrats are holding the reins in Washington now with a Democratic - run White House and Congress , ” said one financial services lobbyist .
“ It only makes sense that donors want to put their money into the coffers of those who are driving the agenda . ”
Among Republicans , the biggest recipient of financial - industry money so far this year is Richard Shelby of Alabama .
But although he ’s the ranking Republican on the Banking Committee — ground zero for the regulatory reform bill in the Senate — he ’s received just $ 313,000 from the industry this year .
That ’s smaller than the haul for Bennet , the most junior Democrat on the Committee , or Lincoln , who is n’t even on it .
And Shelby is the only Republican senator on the industry ’s top - 10 giving list .
The industry ’s giving pattern this year may upend the traditional notion of Republicans as the bagmen for Wall Street .
But it also reflects political reality : Democrats hold a commanding if not quite filibuster - proof majority in the upper chamber , and some of them may be willing to side with the financial industry on key aspects of the regulatory reform effort — even if that ’s not immediately obvious from the Democrats ’ populist rhetoric .
The Financial Services Roundtable , an industry association that gave almost $ 425,000 to members during the past election , says the issues — not the party — drive its donations .
“ We support members that understand the issues facing our industry , ” said Scott Talbott , the Rountable ’s senior vice president of government affairs .
“ This is done on a case - by - case basis . ”
Democrats insist that industry money does n’t influence their votes .
“ Contributions do n’t really affect — my basis of decision making is whether it ’s going to be beneficial to Arkansans , ” said Lincoln , who noted that financial services firms are n’t among her biggest contributors .
Schumer spokesman Brian Fallon says his boss “ calls the shots the way he sees them ” — regardless of who ’s giving him money .
“ The financial services industry is a vital part of New York ’s economy , but he does n’t hesitate to go after the institutions when they are wrong , such as with credit cards , corporate governance and overdraft fees , ” Fallon said .
To compare the $ 1.7 million he ’s gotten from the so - called FIRE lobby — that ’s finance , insurance that ’s not health insurance and real estate — with his positions on key elements of reform , you might think his donors are suffering from Stockholm syndrome .
Schumer , No. 3 in the Senate Democratic leadership and the former chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee , has offered scads of proposals that the industry does n’t like on issues from corporate governance to derivatives to the creation of a new consumer watchdog for the financial world .
But his top donors include insurance company New York Life Insurance , private equity firm Lightyear Capital , futures clearinghouse MBF Clearing Corp. and real estate companies Rudin Management and Related Companies .
Quite a few financial insiders express frustration with Schumer , feeling he ’s thrown the industry under the bus now that it ’s politically popular to do so — after having collected mountains of cash from the industry to help the Democrats build their 60 - vote majority in the Senate .
Others contend that , despite his positions on the hot - button debates surrounding the financial reform effort , Schumer remains an important ally for Wall Street on the technical issues that are n’t grabbing headlines , such as systemic risk regulation and capital requirements for financial institutions .
And on regulatory reform , much of what ’s most important to financial firms exists in those more technical shadow lands .
“ In the end , he still understands the operation of the marketplace , ” explained one financial services executive .
Schumer is also a player on securities and exchange issues , an important area for the securities and investment firms that call New York home and that have given Schumer almost half of his industry checks this cycle — far more than any other member .
The hedge funds and private equity firms included in that giving also see him as something of a champion for them .
Private equity , hedge funds , and venture capital firms gave him more than $ 707,100 during the 2010 cycle , nearly double what the industry has donated to any other member .
Their support can be traced back to a 2007 battle over the “ carried interest ” bill that would have more than doubled the taxes paid by investment managers .
The legislation passed the House , but momentum petered out in the Senate — a victory some financial services lobbyists attribute to Schumer .
Schumer threatened to introduce legislation that would increase the taxes on carried interests for all industries , not just investment managers .
His bill would have hit a litany of partnerships in industries far beyond private equity , such as real estate , oil and gas , and venture capitalists — a poison pill for most lawmakers .
By spreading the pain , Schumer made it difficult for any lawmaker to vote for the bill .
In addition to collecting money from Wall Street for himself , Schumer has helped Gillibrand , the state ’s junior senator , get her share of industry dollars .
Earlier this year , Schumer was instrumental in helping Gillibrand fend off possible 2010 challengers .
In March , he co-hosted a $ 4,800 - per - head fundraiser for her .
And he ’s spent time introducing her to audiences across the state and donors in the financial services world .
Reid and Dodd need no introductions ; the industry knows full well that it can use their help .
Dodd has collected millions from the financial industry since his last reelection in 2004 .
But the Connecticut Democrat — who ’s in for the toughest reelection fight of his career — says there ’s little conflict between the industry donations and his legislative goals .
Efforts to reform the system , says Dodd , will help the industry — particularly smaller players like community banks .
“ It strengthens these financial services , ” he says .
“ People that work for these institutions know what has to be done , too . ”
All told , 19 of the 22 senators on Dodd ’s Banking Committee have received checks from the financial industry this year , and each of those up for reelection in 2010 has received at least $ 180,000 .
Lord Turner was making the point that silly derivatives , bundled together at five removes from any real asset , serve no positive purpose .
In fact , such activities are a bit worse than useless .
But the originators of subprime mortgages and the creators of related derivatives did n't think so .
They liked to boast that they were providing access to the first rung of the housing ladder to people who had never before had the prospect of owning their own homes , or that their derivative products were " facilitating the democratisation of the housing market " .
Maybe it was only the shysters at the bottom of the food chain that were honest enough to think , if not to say out loud : " Here 's a schmuck willing to buy a house , even though he does n't have a job , and my company is dumb enough to let him . "

1. The Halo Effect : ... and the Eight Other Business Delusions That Deceive Managers
This tart takedown of fashionable management theories is a refreshing antidote to the glut of simplistic books about achieving high performance .
Rosenzweig , a veteran business manager turned professor , argues that most popular business ideas are no more than soothing platitudes that promise easy success to harried managers .
Consultants , journalists and other pundits tap scientifically suspect methods to produce what he calls " business delusions " : deeply flawed and widely held assumptions tainted by the " halo effect , " or the need to attribute sweeping positive qualities to any company that has achieved success .
Following these delusions might provide managers with a comforting story that helps them frame their actions , but it also leads them to gross simplification and to ignore the constant demands of changing technologies , markets , customers and situations .
Mega - selling books like Good to Great , Rosenzweig argues , are nothing more than comforting , highbrow business fables .
Unfortunately , Rosenzweig hedges his own principles for success so much that managers will find little practical use for them .
His argument about the complexity of sustained achievement , and his observation that success comes down to " shrewd strategy , superb execution and good luck , " may end up limiting the market for this smart and spicy critique .
2. Fooled by Randomness : The Hidden Role of Chance in Life and in the Markets
If the prescriptions for getting rich that are outlined in books such as The Millionaire Next Door and Rich Dad Poor Dad are successful enough to make the books bestsellers , then one must ask , Why are n't there more millionaires ?
In Fooled by Randomness , Nassim Nicholas Taleb , a professional trader and mathematics professor , examines what randomness means in business and in life and why human beings are so prone to mistake dumb luck for consummate skill .
This eccentric and highly personal exploration of the nature of randomness meanders from the court of Croesus and trading rooms in New York and London to Russian roulette , Monte Carlo engines , and the philosophy of Karl Popper .
Part of what makes this book so good is Taleb 's ability to make seemingly arcane mathematical concepts ( at least to this reviewer ) entirely relevant in evaluating and understanding everything from the stock market to the success of those millionaires cited in the aforementioned bestsellers .
3 . Managers Not MBAs : A Hard Look at the Soft Practice of Managing and Management Development " Conventional MBA programs train the wrong people in the wrong ways with the wrong consequences , " states this academic and author , who here examines and proposes drastic change in our traditional form of management education .
He believes MBA programs are schools of business that pretend to develop managers , and he addresses such issues as what can be done to develop managers in a serious educational process , offering a critique of MBA programs and an analysis of the practice of management itself .
Mintzberg 's recommendations include program changes , as well as his observations on faculty tenure , prima donnas , and entrenched thinking .
He believes MBA programs have failed to develop better managers who should be improving their organizations and thereby creating a better society .
This book offers an important perspective for the global MBA community , which serves its students , business , and society in general .
4 . The Misbehavior of Markets : A Fractal View of Financial Turbulence " ... forty years after I started battle on the subject , most economists now acknowledge that prices do not follow the bell curve , and do not move independently .
But for many , after acknowledging those points , their next comment is :
So what ?
Independence and normality are , they argue , just assumptions that help simplify the math of modern financial theory .
What matters are the results .
Do the standard models correctly predict how the market behaves over all ?
Can an investor use Modern Portfolio
Theory to build a safe , profitable investment strategy ?
Will the Capital Asset Pricing Model help a financial analyst , or a corporate financial officer , make the right decision ?
If so , then stop arguing about it .
This is the so called positivist argument , first advanced by University of Chicago economist Milton Friedman .
" 5 . The Myth of the Rational Market : A History of Risk , Reward , and Delusion on Wall Street Justin Fox has a great blog and writes for Time magazine , having previously written for Fortune magazine .
So it was not a surprise that his book is well written and fast paced .
Better yet , he has chosen to cover the most critical topic in all of finance : does the market correctly price stocks , bonds and real estates ?
In delivering a masterpiece he has either killed himself in thoroughly researching the subject or someone talented has directed him to all the right issues .
He correctly dates the emergence of the efficient markets theory to the early twentieth century , then covers the contribution of Paul Samuelson , who is oddly enough always forgotten in any coverage about the efficient markets doctrine .
He then goes through the sequence of Markowitz , Miller , Modigliani , Fama and Michael Jensen ( an odd insertion indeed , since Jensen sweared by efficient markets theories but made his name emphasizing firm level inefficiencies , ones profitably eliminated by buyout funds , but whose profits would not be so impressive if the market could correctly price their coming contribution ) .
He then introduces Richard Thaler and Robert Shiller , and thus downplays Amos Twersky and Daniel Kahneman , which is a failing of the book .
6 . The Black Swan : The Impact of the Highly Improbable If , as Socrates would have it , the only true knowledge is knowledge of one 's own ignorance , then Nassim Nicholas Taleb is the world 's greatest living teacher .
In The Black Swan , Taleb 's second book for laypeople , he gives a full treatment to concepts briefly explored in his first book " Fooled by Randomness . "
The Black Swan is basically a sequel to that book , but much more focused , detailed and scholarly .
This is a book of serious philosophy that reads like a stand - up comedy routine .
( Think Larry David ... ) 7 . Animal Spirits : How Human Psychology Drives the Economy , and Why It Matters for Global Capitalism Economists , in pursuit of mathematical precision , seem to have forgotten that not everything can be easily counted .
Traditional economic theory centers on the premise that people make perfectly rational decisions .
People , however , are not so rational .
Despite many attempts , not every variable that goes into our decision - making process can be easily quantified , weighted , and stuffed into a formula .
As any non-economist knows psychology -- and its hard to measure variables -- plays a large role in how people make decisions .
George Akerlof and Robert Shiller 's book , Animal Spirits , offers an accessible look at how traditional economics can be expanded by incorporating some basic concepts from psychology .
The term " animal spirits , " originally coined John Maynard Keynes in the 1930's , describes how impulses and emotions naturally lead to economic boom and bust cycles .
Traditional economists seem to have ignored even the most primitive of these spirits .
8. Fortune 's Formula : The Untold Story of the Scientific Betting System That Beat the Casinos and Wall Street Fortune 's Formula is a fascinating study of the connections between such seemingly unrelated topics as gambling , information theory , stock investing , and applied mathematics .
The story involves the stunning brainpower of men such as MIT professor Claude Shannon , who single - handedly invented information theory , the science behind the Internet and all digital media ; Ed Thorpe ; and John Kelly of Bell Laboratories , who developed the " Kelly criterion , " a now - legendary investment strategy for maximizing growth while controlling risk .
Initially , Shannon and Thorpe took Kelly 's theory to Las Vegas and applied it to roulette and blackjack .
Later , they took it to Wall Street and cleaned up -- Shannon made a personal fortune while Thorpe created the highly successful hedge firm Princeton - Newport Partners .
They both discovered that Kelly 's system was particularly effective when applied to arbitrage ( minute price differences that result from market inefficiencies ) .
As Poundstone ably demonstrates , the merits of Kelly 's criterion are still hotly debated today .
9 . A Failure of Capitalism : The Crisis of '08 and the Descent into Depression Posner ( How Judges Think ) is uncharacteristically dry in this dense book that states flatly that we are in a recession only because we are too frightened to call it a depression .
He makes a near - heroic attempt to delve into the roots of the current crisis , citing some of the harder questions : how did it happen ?
why was it not anticipated ?
how is the government responding ?
A great deal of ground is covered , and the book takes the form of a high - altitude survey , assessing all the major points without getting bogged down in detail .
Quickie explanations of subprime mortgages and the credit crunch orient the reader , and Posner addresses the takeaway lessons about capitalism and government , the puzzling lack of foresight from the economist community , the apportioning of blame and the resulting future of conservatism .
All good topics , thoroughly and thoughtfully presented , but much of Posner 's material is already woefully out of date .
This book will make a serviceable study of the current crisis , but it does not serve its intended audience well in the meantime .
10 .
Outliers : The Story of Success
The main tenet of Outliers is that there is a logic behind why some people become successful , and it has more to do with legacy and opportunity than high IQ .
In his latest book , New Yorker contributor Gladwell casts his inquisitive eye on those who have risen meteorically to the top of their fields , analyzing developmental patterns and searching for a common thread .
The author asserts that there is no such thing as a self - made man , that " the true origins of high achievement " lie instead in the circumstances and influences of one 's upbringing , combined with excellent timing .
The Beatles had Hamburg in 1960 - 62 ; Bill Gates had access to an ASR - 33 Teletype in 1968 .
Both put in thousands of hours - Gladwell posits that 10,000 is the magic number - on their craft at a young age , resulting in an above - average head start .
A trio of public interest groups is asking a federal judge to reject a claim that copyright law is violated when a person 's cellphone plays " Who Can It Be Now " in public when someone calls , arguing that the songwriters ' claims " stigmatize millions of consumers as lawbreakers . "
Public Knowledge , the Center for Democracy and Technology and the Electronic Frontier Foundation told a federal court Wednesday that a publicly ringing phone is no different from a person humming a tune in an elevator , listening to music in a convertible , or singing Happy Birthday at a party in the park – all activities that are not considered copyright infringements .
But the American Society of Composers , Authors , and Publishers or ASCAP , a group that collects royalties for artists and songwriters , wants big telecom companies to pay it extra for the ringtones they sell , arguing that the ringtones constitute a " public performance . "
ASCAP collects royalties anywhere where there is money to found – from internet radio stations to a taco stand with a radio next to the grill to giant arenas to a coffee shop where someone might cover a song on open mic night .
ASCAP 's licensing page for ringtones no longer exists on its site , but can be found in the Internet Archive and a model ringtone licensing agreement is available as well .
While ASCAP says it 's not going to sue individuals for unauthorized public ringing , the group 's arguments ( . pdf ) are dangerous , the groups argue .
" Whether or not consumers are directly targeted by ASCAP members for royalties or litigation , they will face increased prices , the risk of suit in other contexts , and an artificially depleted set of innovative technologies and services if ASCAP 's arguments are accepted here , " the groups wrote in a friend of the court brief ( .pdf ) .
Fines for copyright infringement are steep , up to $ 150,000 per violation .
For example , Jammie Thomas , who was busted sharing 24 copyrighted music files on the internet , was fined $ 1.92 million by a jury in June .
The tiff comes in a suit ASCAP filed against AT&T and Verizon that now pending in a Manhattan federal court .
EFF , and the other two groups , are asking the court to throw out the suit against the nation 's largest wireless carriers .
Now there 's some irony for you .
And by the by , you should n't be paying for ringtones anyway .
Buy the music once and use it how you like– though that 's often easier said than done given how this country 's mobile carriers treat your mobile device as if it were theirs .

Aston Martin Bulldog
August 7 , 2009
In 1975 Aston Martin was sold to a pair of North American businessmen named Peter Sprague and George Minden .
One year later the iconic Lagonda was introduced to the world , a futuristic car designed by stylist William Towns .
However , that same year , Towns sketched up an even more radical version of his design that would eventually become the mid-engined supercar we all know today as the Aston Martin Bulldog .
Though Towns ' original design was initially knocked back by management , a special one - off version was unveiled in March of 1980 as proof that Aston Martin could build a world - class supercar .
Standing only 43 inches tall ( just a little bit taller than the Ford GT40 ) , the Bulldog packed a 325 bhp 5.3L V8 sourced from the Lagonda with a pair of Garrett AirResearch turbochargers bolted on .
The end result was a peak output of 700 bhp and an estimated top speed of 237mph .
Sadly the Bulldog was only ever given one official test run where it achieved a top speed of 191mph .

So far , the notion has been presented in at least 10 states ( though it has already been rejected or left behind in committees in some of them ) , and lawmakers in four other states have said they will soon offer similar measures in what has grown into a coordinated effort at resistance .
( Arizona , which has placed the amendment on its ballot in 2010 , seems the furthest along . )
Here in Minnesota , as in many of the other states , the move to amend the State Constitution is being driven by a handful of Republican lawmakers .
The proposed amendment itself does not advocate some particular alternative plan , but sets what its authors see as ground rules for what any future health care system should  and should not  include .
“ All I ’m trying to do is protect the individual ’s right to make health care decisions , ” said State Representative Tom Emmer , a Republican .
“ I just do n’t want the government getting between my decisions with my doctors . ”
Many who favor a federal overhaul of health care say it can be affordable only if nearly everyone is required to carry insurance , but the efforts by these state lawmakers actually predate the Obama administration and the current federal health care debate .
Proposed constitutional amendments began cropping up after 2006 , when Massachusetts enacted a sweeping state measure meant to create nearly universal health coverage for residents .
Elsewhere , some leaders  opposed to the possibility of insurance mandates or government - run systems  began suggesting constitutional amendments to block such measures from their own states .
The web should be as free and unconstrained as a blank piece of paper , its creator has said .
Speaking at a BBC event to mark the 20th anniversary of the web , Sir Tim Berners - Lee said the internet should not be controlled , censored or intercepted by government or companies .
He asked the audience to consider someone looking up sensitive information - such as cancer symptoms or what it 's like to come out as homosexual .
If a government or company is monitoring every click , people wo n't feel comfortable using the web to find help with such matters , degrading the usefulness offered by the online world , he claimed .
" The internet should be like a white piece of paper , " he said .
When you buy paper , " it does not come with the fundamental constraint on it that you can only write truth , " he said , adding that you " ca n't get drawing paper where it 's impossible to draw a nude figure . "
Anonymous
That said , Berners - Lee does n't think web users should always be anonymous .
He said anonymity is important in some cases - such as when people were struggling against their government - but added that much of what was said online did n't require such protection .
He said we need to " realise that the whistle blower syndrome is an emergency , it 's an exception . "

Could it be that Senate Republicans are starting to feel the heat in the healthcare debate ?
It seems so as GOP senators John McCain , Kit Bond , and Senate GOP leader Mitch McConnell are all participating in healthcare forums together , but they are closed to the public .
Attendance is by invite only .
According to Think Progress , the three Republicans held a healthcare reform forum in Kansas City that was closed to the public , “ ThinkProgress spoke with Barbara Mueth , vice president of community relations at Children ’s Mercy , who confirmed that the attendees had all been invited by either the hospital or the senators .
At the event , McConnell said that it was time to “ step back and start over ” on health care . ”
McConnell and McCain are also holding healthcare reform forums in North Carolina and Florida this week that will not be open to the public .
To his credit , McCain has held widely publicized town halls , but McConnell has n’t .
Instead he has limited his speaking engagements to audiences that are opposed to reform .
Advertisements
Democratic Sen. Claire McCaskill took McConnell to task for keeping the forum closed to the public , “ I ’m disappointed that the Republican leader of the Senate is coming to Kansas City on Monday and participating in a forum , but they ’re not opening it up to the public .
It ’s invitation - only .
I think it might be helpful for the leadership in the Republican Party to have some of the experiences I ’ve had over the last week , where some of the meetings are wildly in favor of reform , and other meetings are wildly against it .
I think having that pulse is important , and I think the Republican leader would benefit from that . ”
McConnell does n’t want to hear that some of his constituents could be in favor healthcare reform .
It does n’t matter to him what bill comes out of the Senate , he has already made up his mind to oppose it .
This is n’t about healthcare reform .
He is trying to derail the Democrats .
McConnell is the prime example of the idea that the Democrats could give the GOP everything they want in a bill , and they would still oppose it .
The same Republicans , who defended the town hall protesters as people using their First Amendment rights , wo n’t do the same thing for people who favor healthcare reform .
What about the First Amendment rights of those who want to see a bill pass ?
Do n’t their rights matter ?
The bigger question is why is Mitch McConnell afraid to face the public ?
I think the scales are tipping away from the anti-reform movement .
Now that the left has mobilized , the little mobs of healthcare protesters are n’t nearly as effective at these town halls as they were earlier in August .
If these Senate Republicans were serious about healthcare reform , they would engage in an open debate with the public instead of cherry picking their audiences .
NEW YORK / EULESS , Texas ( Reuters ) -
All you have to do to feel the outrage over the continuing flow of bonuses on Wall Street is to take a walk down Main Street .
A street sign marking Main Street stands in Port Washington , New York October 8 , 2008 .
REUTERS / Shannon Stapleton
Reuters reporters spoke to people in half a dozen towns and cities across the country at the end of last week -- and while the survey was far from scientific , it left no doubt many people are upset bankers are still pulling in big bonuses while many people struggle to make ends meet .
Ask Ahmet Rika and his father , Tony , as they work around hot ovens at their family owned pizza and pasta restaurant in Euless , Texas , how they feel about multibillion - dollar bonus pools and their disdain is obvious .
“ It ’s not right , ” said Ahmet .
“ All our taxes go to them .
It will be bad for the government . ”
Tony interjected : “ They give them this bonus !
They must give the bonus to the poor people so they can spend it ! ” he said as he wiped his hands on his apron , shaking his head in disgust .
In particular there is anger over the fact Wall Street firms are setting aside billions of dollars to reward employees at year - end so soon after the industry needed taxpayers to lend them hundreds of billions of dollars to stay afloat .
Even U.S. documentary maker Michael Moore is tapping into the anger , planning to release his latest movie , “ Capitalism : A Love Story . ”
The filmmaker , who aims to show how capitalism is evil and benefits only the rich , stokes the public sentiment by demanding that financial firms repay the billions they borrowed .
The outrage comes at a time when the unemployment rate has reached 9.7 percent , the highest since 1983 , and families continue to lose their homes to bank foreclosure at alarming rates .
If left unaddressed it could come back to haunt President Barack Obama who began his time in the Oval Office by condemning massive bonuses for bankers during the financial crisis , but has since become much quieter on the topic .
U.S. Sen . Sherrod Brown , a Democrat , spent much of the past month in his home state of Ohio , which has been one of the hardest hit by the recession .
“ You need about a day out there to see that people are really angry , ” Brown said in an interview with Reuters .
“ Some of this crowd helped to bring down our economy and they do n’t seem to have learned their lesson .
Too many are still given big bonuses for a job that has been bad for our economy .
“ We need to dog some of these companies that sort of tend to be dismissive toward the public . ”
LOST TOUCH WITH REALITY
Goldman Sachs Group Inc and American International Group
Inc have been among the poster children for the industry ’s addiction to massive bonuses .
Soon after receiving $ 10 billion in taxpayer bailouts , Goldman set aside $ 11.3 billion for year - end bonuses .
AIG paid out $ 165 million in bonuses to employees who contributed to the company ’s meltdown .
While Goldman has paid back the government , the size of the bonuses it is reserving for its employees -- averaging $ 768,000 based on the first six months but projected over the entire year -- does not play well on Main Street .
“ Wall Street has lost touch with reality , paying themselves such huge bonuses when the taxpayers who bailed them out are suffering , ” said Ruth Santini , a retiree living in the western suburbs of Chicago .
“ They put us in this mess , so I ’d rather see some of them go to jail than get a bonus . ”
The fact that Wall Street bankers and traders seem to get paid handsomely , win or lose , is most damning to some , especially as they see their savings dwindle .
“ I guess I ended up in the wrong career , ” said Mark Benson , 39 , a restaurant manager in downtown Chicago .
“ It must be nice to work on Wall Street , when you profit you get a bonus , when your company fails you get a government bailout then a bonus .
“ I ’m all for free enterprise , it ’s what built America .
But when Wall Street screws up so badly that the government has to print money to bail them out , I confess the bonuses they ’re still paying themselves make me feel sick . ”
Some who know Wall Street say the culture really is changing and bankers and traders are now more cautious .
Their pay is also becoming closely tied to their performance , said Brad Hintz , a stock analyst with Sanford C. Bernstein , and a former executive with Morgan Stanley and Lehman Brothers .
“ Is Wall Street going to continue to be well paid ?
Yes , ” Hintz said .
“ The Wall Street people wo n’t be selling pencils or apples on the streets . ”
And not everyone on Main Street cares about what Wall Street players get paid -- especially as more banks move to repay the billions they borrowed from taxpayers with interest .
“ If that is the case , then those banking officers deserve to be compensated well , ” said George Fleming , 64 , a career transition coach in Phoenix , Arizona .
“ I have been somewhat critical of executive compensation in the past , but you know what , if they are returning the money that the taxpayers have loaned them with that kind of return , then I ’m certainly a big fan . ”
Fleming seems to be in the minority .
At a shopping mall in Nashville , Tennessee , Annie Phillips , a 48 - year - old housewife , used profanity to describe Washington ’s handling of Wall Street .
“ Out here in the real world , people are unemployed and hungry and those bankers and the other big shots do n’t give a damn , ” Phillips said .
Apple ’s Mighty Mouse works great most of the time , but there are times when the trackball simply stops working .
Sometimes you can scroll up but not down , down but not up , and sometimes , you ca n’t even scroll at all .
There are a number of ways to fix this , but not all of them work swimmingly .
For instance , you can try rubbing the trackball with a q-tip or paper towel soaked in rubbing alcohol , or you can try inserting the corner of a piece of paper into the space between the trackball and the rest of the device .
From our experience , both of the above solutions work , but only temporarily .
That being the case , sometimes you need to get your hands dirty and actually open up your mouse and clean the trackball manually to get rid of any dirt and dust particles that might have taken up residence there .
The following video explains how to do just that .
Lastly , and in typical Apple fashion , opening up the mouse requires some effort , so proceed with caution and at your own risk !

Actor Charlie Sheen has followed up on his “ 20 Minutes With The President ” letter by directly addressing President Obama in a You Tube clip to request he use his executive power to reopen the investigation into 9/11 and its aftermath .
On Tuesday , Sheen published a fictional account of a meeting with the President on radio talk show host Alex Jones ’ Infowars.com and Prison Planet.com websites in which Obama was confronted about what Sheen alleges is a cover - up surrounding 9/11 .
In his letter , Sheen requests a real meeting with Barack Obama .
[ efoods ]
Now Sheen has taken his challenge a step further by appearing in a You Tube video that asks Obama to “ be on the right side of history ” by reopening an investigation into 9/11 , while highlighting that the majority of the 9/11 Commission members have publicly dismissed the official government version of the attacks as a deception , with former Senator and Commission member Max Cleland labeling the government response to the Commission ’s questions as “ disgusting ” and “ a scam ” .
Sheen highlights several issues in the video , including the unexplained collapse of WTC 7 , a 47 - story building that was not hit by a plane yet collapsed in free fall fashion into its own footprint within 7 seconds later in the afternoon on September 11 .
He also cites multiple reports from firefighters , police , first responders and others who were at ground zero and who all described explosions before the collapse of the twin towers and Building 7 .
He also discusses how former FBI translator Sibel Edmonds broke her gag order to go public with the revelation that Bin Laden and Al - Qaeda were working with the U.S. government right up until the day of 9/11 .
Sheen also demands to know why NORAD ’s standard operating procedure was not followed on 9/11 , allowing the hijacked jetliners to find their targets , asking , “ Where were the planes ? ”
Sheen expresses his hope that President Obama has read his letter , adding , “ We have questions Mr. President , lots of questions …. people of the United States and the world demand the truth sir , ” adding that Obama has the power and the responsibility to initiate “ a truly independent Congressional investigation into the events of 9/11 as well as its aftermath . ”
“ We want our country back Mr. President , therefore I ’m not just calling on you I ’m calling on your team , I ’m calling on each and every American citizen to wake up , stand up , and demand the truth , ” states Sheen in the video .

At the Un - National Monument Along the Canadian Border ( from poetry 180 )
William Stafford
This is the field where the battle did not happen ,
where the unknown soldier did not die .
This is the field where grass joined hands ,
where no monument stands ,
and the only heroic thing is the sky .
Birds fly here without any sound ,
unfolding their wings across the open .
No people killed — or were killed — on this ground
hallowed by neglect and an air so tame
that people celebrate it by forgetting its name .
Comment :
The line that matters for our purposes is “ the only heroic thing is the sky . ”
How is the sky “ heroic ? ”
It allows birds to spread their wings without a care – there ’s no sound because there ’s no struggle .
The ground is not heroic ; it is the “ Un- National Monument ” that marks heroism .
It is neglected by both man and sky , as sky ca n’t even bother to assault it to mark it in some way .
It is frequently forgotten .
It is most likely not heroic because it is not completely self - negating : no monument stands there , but the ground is a monument .
It stands in contrast to other “ fields , ” where the “ unknown soldier ” did die , and the grass did not join hands .
It looks like ground is a monument to the sky , which allows the grass to “ join hands ” here .
Man is emphatically not the issue all throughout the poem : that other fields are marked with blood is not the ground or sky ’s fault .
But that the grass ca n’t “ join hands ” – that birds would be able to spread their wings without any resistance – that ’s all a matter of the sky .
So what ’s happening ?
The complete self - negation of the sky brings into the question the reality of heroism ( i.e. man ’s willing self - negation ) .
Heroism , though , knows itself to be a contradictory thing : one strives both hoping one will be remembered , and if not , knowing that one can live with oneself having done what one wanted regardless .
Even the most selfish is compelled to self - sacrifice for the sake of action – I think the Navy runs submarine drills where if a sailor is in a flooding compartment and has no chance of survival , but has to get something done so the whole ship does n’t sink , it gets done .
To bring forward the notion of complete self - negation is to attempt to make heroism logically sound : this allows for a sphere of total freedom , the self - negation is marked merely by what lies around it .
It also implies the end of both nations and heroism : without nations , there can be no heroes , “ only ” one heroic thing .
But that brings us to “ hallowed ” ground ( cf. the Gettysburg Address ) .
Sure , we ’ve traded heroism for a complete peace , but is this the realm of man ?
Birds unfold their wings across the open , but we do n’t fly .
More importantly , we join hands : grass does n’t .
That slight opening – “ hey wait , how do you know no one was killed at the area you stand ? ” – makes me wonder whether this is a real peace or not .
After all , even our speaker recognizes the “ monument ” here .
In Hesiod , the age of Kronos is when the golden age occurred ; all was peaceful and there was no war .
But one had to be ruled by Kronos , who dealt with the problems of freedom and change by swallowing his children .
Sculptor and concept artist Jordu Schell breathed life into the Na'Vi , Avatar 's blue aliens .
He talks about working with James Cameron , the actresses who inspired the lovely Neytiri 's look , and why design is n't the most interesting part of Avatar .
Advertisement
We spoke to Jordu Schell of the Schell Sculpture Studio .
Schell has done sculpture and conceptual creature designs for numerous films , including Galaxy Quest , Dawn of the Dead , Hellboy , and The Mist , and he brought the Na'Vi to three - dimensional life .
When did you begin work on this project ?
I first was contacted in about May of 2005 .
Jim picked people — there are only four of us — there were three other guys , including a famous guy named Wayne Barlow who 's a creature and character designer , and I primarily was hired to just do illustration .
Along with these other three , I started doing illustrations , drawing and stuff .
Advertisement
I was really frustrated because my real forte is sculpting — you know , actual sculpture in clay , not in 3D programs .
And after a while , that frustration became obvious , because I just felt like I was working on design with my hand tied behind my back if you will and I left the project , actually in about June or so of 2005 .
But then , Jim actually called me back in November of that same year , just a few months later , and said , " Hey , listen , the guys who were doing the 3D brush renderings just are n't capturing what I want , and I think I do want sculpture after all . "
So I went back in and I started doing sculptures .
And Jim responded immediately to the sculpture .
He really felt that that was the best way to capture the look that he wanted .
So I started doing maquettes of the characters , starting with the main character named Neytiri .
And from there on , I did maquettes and designs of every character in the movie .

And how long was the process ?
How many iterations did you go through ?
At first , I started off doing busts of Neytiri , the main female character .
And then Jim said , " I want to see a full body of her ; I want to see her full physicality . "
So , I did a full maquette of her , which is roughly about 15 inches tall of her , which will probably be on the DVD and in a book of the making of and all this stuff .
But that maquette is what I think really really established me with Jim as somebody important on the team , because I remember very clearly he came into the office I was in and went , " That 's her !
That 's her !
That 's it !
Do n't change a thing .
That 's it . "
Which , to hear from Jim , is kind of incredible .
Advertisement
Was that the first time he had seen the entire thing ?
Yes , that was the first time I had done a full body design of any of the characters .
Advertisement
How many characters did you design overall ?
Oh gosh .
I did a design of the lead female .
I did — I do n't know , I would say I did probably about 15 total maquettes of the characters , and I did a bunch of maquettes also of the creatures that are in the film .
Most of those maquettes — all of those maquettes — were based on designs that come from other artists that I kind of massaged into a more realistic realm taken from the drawing .
Advertisement
And in fact , the design of the Na'Vi in general — that kind of cat - like appearance — was already established by Jim .
That 's what Jim wanted .
He had already done a sketch of Neytiri , just of her face , which I thought was exquisite .
And he did — somebody had done a very loose CBrush of what the bodies would look like , but it did n't look organic yet , and that 's why I was called in .
Advertisement
When you started the process , what did James Cameron tell you about the Na'Vi ?
Well , I knew that they were humanoid , that they were blue - skinned , that they were cat creatures , but that he very much wanted them to retain a humanoid , human - faced element to them .
He wanted them to be elegant , slender .
I think they were supposed to be about nine feet tall — three meters , whatever that is .
I knew the basic physical parameters .
Of course , I was given the script ; I read the script and figured out how they fit into the context of the world , and all that sort of thing .
Advertisement
Were they at all influenced by any animal in nature , or any other alien in fiction ?
I would n't say so .
I certainly got no reference to go from , other than a whole stack of photos of actresses that he [ James Cameron ] really liked , not necessarily that he was going to cast in the role , the vocal role or ... the motion capture .
Not necessarily for the motion capture , but for inspiration in terms of the beauty of a kind of ethnic face .
I remember he very much liked the face of a girl named Q'Orianka Kilcher , who starred in The New World , which was a Pocahontas movie with Colin Farrell .
But , you know , I had pictures of Mary J. Blige and all these different people on the walls of really beautiful ethnic women .
Advertisement
You said that Cameron saw the first sculpture you did and said that was it .
So has the design changed at all from there ?
Here 's the thing : that 's an interesting question .
I did the maquette .
He loved the face ; he loved the body ; he loved the physicality ; he loved the athleticism ; he loved the anatomy .
At some point , Stan Winston studios was brought in specifically to massage the faces , to do some work on the faces .
And they came up with a face that was really quite radically different from the face that was on my maquette .
And I thought , " Oh well .
Stan will have designed the faces and I 'll have designed the body . "
Advertisement
But now that I see the trailer , it looks as if it has returned almost exactly to what I did on the maquette .
I mean it looks almost exactly it .
It might be a little less — I mean because things change somewhat in CG — it might not be quite as ripped in terms of anatomy or defined in terms of anatomy as mine was , but it looks very much like the maquette that I did .
Have you talked to anyone about that ?
Has anyone said anything to you about them changing it back ?
Advertisement
No , because I 've been off the project .
I left the project in 2007 .
All this stuff ran out and Jim was starting to shoot by the time I left .
Other than going to little parties that Jim has thrown , I have n't really been privy to what 's been going on down at Weta .
And I 'm good friends with Richard Taylor , who runs Weta , but I have n't even really spoken to him much about it , like what 's going on down there .
But I know they 've been very busy down there on it , and they probably still are .
Advertisement
What about the sex appeal aspect of it ?
Was the sexiness something James Cameron emphasized with you ?
Well , he wanted them to be very beautiful .
And I do believe that , at some point , he said something to the effect of ... the audience has to want to fuck her .
I mean , Jim is very plain in his language .
Advertisement
So , I went , " All right ? "
So I made something that , I do n't know if I really particularly wanted to fuck it , but it was certainly a beautiful alien .
He definitely , he wanted it — because he really prefers women that are kind of athletic , and buff and stuff like that , so I , you know , designed something with big hands and feet , a big presence that felt really big and strong .
So it was designed for his personal preferences in terms of sexiness ?
It certainly was n't mine .
I mean , I would have sculpted , I do n't know , Gretchen Mol or something .
But I sculpted this big , tall , buff , kind of tough - looking , kick - ass woman .

To what extent are the Na'Vi a product of the physical environment of Pandora ?
Is it just the way they are for the aesthetics , or did he indicate there was something about Pandora that made them the way that they were ?
For example , why are they blue ?
Advertisement
Oh , honestly , I believe that they 're blue because it 's unusual and weird .
I mean , maybe there 's some ecology - based sense that it makes in the context of the story .
I do n't remember reading anything in the script that went into — I mean , everything on the planet has kind of aqua to blue palette , at least what I remember seeing .
But no , he did n't go into detail at least to me about the specific ecological or environmental reasons why they were the color they were .
But I know that he wanted that from the start .
He said , " I really want them to be unusual .
I want them to have these weird patterns , " and so that was definitely what he wanted .
So your impression is that it was more about making them exotic ?
Yes , absolutely .
What about the feline aspect ?
Do you have any indication of why they are so feline ?
Advertisement
I do n't know .
It 's probably because he thinks that cats are elegant , and they are .
I mean , so are horses , but we do n't have horse - faced aliens , I guess .
So , I think it was a matter of elegance , and he wanted them all to be trim — I guess they do n't have Ding - Dongs on Pandora .
In the Avatar Day footage , we see a kind of appendage coming out of Sully 's braid that binds him to the dragon - like creature .
Is that part of the design , or were you just told " Oh , there 's this big braid ? "
Advertisement
Oh yes .
That 's definitely part of the design , and it does have something specific to do with Na'Vi culture .
However , I probably should n't as yet say until the film comes out what 's going on there .
Are there going to be other surprises like that in their design ?
Definitely .
There are definitely some things about them that are more than just meets the eye .
Advertisement
More Na'Vi weirdness ?
Yeah , I mean , they do n't split open into gigantic demon creatures or something , but you 'll definitely see aspects of them that are unusual and cool and unique to this particular creature .
Advertisement
And how was designing for Avatar different from other designing experiences you 've had ?
The only main difference — it was a very long , long project .
There was so much stuff and so much to do and so many people involved .
I mean , hands down the biggest thing I 've been involved with .
Advertisement
Are you aware of the backlash online , with some people being disappointed with , for example , how humanoid or how feline the Na'Vi look ?
Well , I mean , I know some people were disappointed , some people think it 's amazing .
Some people were disappointed , some think it 's amazing .
To me , that 's typical fan reaction .
There 's always some backlash against something with a lot of hype .
The only way to avoid backlash is for there to be no hype .
And it seems that there 's always some kind of negativity surrounding this stuff .
Some love it , some hate it .
Advertisement
So , when something like District 9 comes out — until something like two weeks , three weeks before it came out , there was no knowledge of it by anyone .
It just came out of nowhere .
So , as a result , it 's getting a lot of accolades .
I have a feeling that if it had been promoted as the biggest thing ever six months prior to its arrival , a year prior to its arrival , it would have had severe backlash as well .
I can only chalk that up to typical fan reaction to something that has gotten a tremendous amount of hype , a huge amount of advance word , and there 's bound to be people that are disappointed .
Do you have any response to the people who have been disappointed ?
If their problem is with the physical look of the characters , then no , there 's not much I can say .
That 's the way they 're obviously going to look .
But I think that the story is strong enough to transcend any visual issues anyone might have .
We should not be going to the movies , in my opinion , strictly to be visually dazzled .
That is a post - modern , special effects attitude .
People should be going to the movies to be told a story and they should be going to be enveloped in a world where they 're going to be transported somewhere else .

When you are going through a family law proceeding in Wisconsin , a court may make decisions that can affect the rest of your life .
When so much is at stake , you cannot afford to take chances by trying to navigate the process alone .
No matter your situation , you should seek counsel from an experienced and aggressive attorney who understands the law and procedures and who will make sure that your voice is heard .
At Reddin & Singer , family law attorney Terese J. Singer advises and vigorously represents clients on all matters related to divorce and custody .
Our firm also can assist you with criminal matters in Wisconsin courts , such as DUI and drug charges .
Wisconsin mandates a no - fault divorce on the basis of an irretrievable breakdown of the marriage .
Either spouse must have been a bona fide resident of the state for a minimum of six months .
A key issue that is likely to arise during a divorce is property distribution , which determines which spouse receives which assets from the marriage .
Wisconsin is a marital property state , so each spouse is entitled to an equal share of the marital estate .
It may be necessary to determine whether a piece of property is part of the marital estate or separate property .
Only the marital estate will be divided , while generally each spouse keeps their own separate property .
In Wisconsin , a married couple may obtain a legal separation instead of a divorce , and sometimes a separation will be converted into a divorce .
A court can issue orders in connection with a number of issues during a legal separation , including the division of property , child custody , support , and visitation .
In this way , the process is similar to divorce .
Also , one of the spouses trying to get a legal separation must be a Wisconsin resident for six months before filing for the separation and a resident of the county where they are petitioning for the separation for at least 30 days before filing .
Certain grounds must be alleged for the separation .
In Wisconsin , children are entitled to support from both parents .
Child support guidelines are used to set the amount of payments in what is called the Percentage of Income Standard .
Some of the factors considered include income , how much time is spent with each parent , and whether other children are also receiving financial support .
In Wisconsin , child support is based on gross monthly income or the amount that a parent receives , which is the income before taxes , Social Security , and other amounts are deducted each month .
Legal custody and placement of a child can be very fraught issues .
When parents divorce , the court will make orders about these matters .
Placement involves the time that a child spends with each parent , while legal custody is made up of a parent 's right to make major decisions for a child in areas such as medical care , education , and religion .
Wisconsin courts are guided by the child 's best interests when deciding custody and placement matters .
Often , parents are able to reach their own agreement as to custody and placement with the help of an experienced family attorney in the Milwaukee area .
The court likely will approve the agreement if it finds that it is consistent with the child ’s best interests .
Same - sex divorce can bring up unique issues , such as from which date the start of the marriage should be calculated for the purposes of marital property division and parental rights .
In Wisconsin , when a parent has placement of a child for more than 50 % of the time , the other parent is usually required to pay child support based on percentage guidelines .
However , same - sex couples were unable to adopt in Wisconsin before 2014 , so many children were adopted by a single parent .
Thus , one parent may be better situated than the other with regard to issues like child support and child custody .
It is important to retain an experienced Milwaukee family lawyer who understands the complexities of the issues at play , and who can make strong arguments for an appropriate and fair outcome .
When a modification would substantially reduce the time that one parent has with a child , courts usually refrain from modifying legal custody or placement within the first two years of the order .
There are exceptions when there is a risk of harm or when the parents share substantially equal time with a child , but one is unable to fulfill those responsibilities , and it would be in the best interests of the child to modify the order .
After two years have passed , a parent or guardian can seek a modification of custody or placement by petitioning for a modification and showing that the modification is in the child 's best interests and that the parent has had a substantial change in circumstances .
In some marriages , there are assets that are substantial in value , such as vacation homes , bank accounts , trusts , pensions , stocks , annuities , retirement benefits , businesses that may or may not have goodwill , and heirlooms .
High asset divorces can be more complicated , particularly when spouses try to hide assets from each other or improperly value important assets .
A Milwaukee family attorney can help you hire forensic accountants , tax advisers , or financial planning experts to ensure that property is appropriately traced and characterized and that an appropriate division is reached based on relevant factors .
Premarital agreements are contracts related to such issues as property division and finances that are formed before a couple marries .
Post - marital agreements are contracts formed after a couple marries .
Some factors that the court will consider when deciding whether to enforce a premarital agreement include whether the parties knowingly and voluntarily entered into the agreement , whether complete financial disclosures were made , whether both parties had legal representation , and whether there has been any substantial , unforeseeable change in circumstances that affects the fairness of the agreement at the time of the divorce .
There are many potential grounds for challenging a premarital or post - marital agreement .
Under Wisconsin Statute 767.43 , grandparents may petition the court to get visitation with grandchildren .
The court can grant reasonable visitation to a grandparent if visitation is in the child 's best interests , but it is supposed to give significant deference to a parent ’s right to decide what is in their child 's best interests , and the child 's wishes are also considered .
Generally , grandparents can assert their rights during or after legal actions that affect the whole family , such as divorce or custody modification .
There are certain situations in which it may be appropriate to seek an annulment rather than a separation or a divorce .
A family attorney at our Milwaukee firm can advise you on whether this option may be right for you .
An annulment is different from a divorce in that it invalidates a marriage as if it did not happen at all .
Grounds for annulment include an underage spouse , force or duress , a lasting form of mental incapacity , or a temporary impairment like intoxication .
A spouse also may be able to obtain an annulment if the marriage involved fraud , bigamy , incest , or impotence .
A divorce can take months .
It can be important to obtain temporary orders to address such issues as alimony , custody of children , child support , property issues , debts , and health insurance coverage for children .
Generally , temporary orders can be obtained at any time before the divorce trial .
The court will consider the same factors when making temporary orders that it considers when making final orders .
Sometimes the terms of the temporary order are kept for the purposes of a final order , particularly when children are involved , so it is important to retain a skilled family lawyer in the Milwaukee area who can represent your interests .
In Wisconsin , domestic violence occurs under Wisconsin State Statute section 968.075 when there is or has been a household , spousal , or co-parenting relationship .
It involves the intentional infliction of physical pain , illness , or injury , the intentional impairment of the victim ’s physical condition , sexual assault , or physical actions that cause a reasonable fear that any of these acts is imminent .
Domestic violence also can affect child custody and other family law proceedings .
A restraining order is a legal order issued by a court that requires one person to stop harming another person .
The order may be sought due to harassment , domestic abuse , or child abuse , among other situations .
The existence of a restraining order can significantly influence certain issues , such as how child custody and property division are handled during a divorce .
A family attorney at our Milwaukee firm can help Wisconsin residents pursue or fight against restraining orders .
Operating a vehicle under the influence of alcohol can be charged if you are caught while driving with a blood alcohol concentration of .08 % or greater .
There is an implied consent law that states that when you drive in Wisconsin , you have given consent to submit to a chemical test .
If you are convicted of a first offense , you may face a fine , a surcharge , a suspension of your license , and mandatory alcohol and other drug assessments .
You may be found to be a high - risk driver , which means that you would have increased insurance rates .
Certain situations can increase the penalties , such as having a minor who is under the age of 16 in the car at the time of the drunk driving .
Further DUI offenses carry additional penalties , such as possible jail time and the installation of an ignition interlock device .
Wisconsin criminalizes the possession , cultivation , sale , manufacture , and trafficking of controlled substances .
If you have been caught with an illegal substance on your person ( such as in a pocket ) or within your control ( such as in your car or home ) , you may be charged with possession .
Drug charges can be misdemeanors or felonies , depending on which controlled substance is at issue , the amount , which action was involved , and any prior history of drug crimes .

As with SQL , SPARQL 's most popular verb is SELECT .
It lets you request the data you want from a collection , whether you 're asking for a single phone number or you want a list of first and last names and phone numbers of all employees hired after January 1st , sorted by last name .
CONSTRUCT provides a nice example of how SPARQL is more than a query language ; along with extracting data using queries , you can create useful new data as well .
In SPARQL , SELECT is actually known as a query form , and another is CONSTRUCT .
According to the SPARQL Query Language for RDF W3C Recommendation , CONSTRUCT returns a graph — a set of triples .
I had thought of CONSTRUCT as a way of pulling a set of triples out of a triplestore , especially a remote triplestore , but while reviewing some TopQuadrant training material I realized how handy CONSTRUCT can be to create useful new triples .
For example , let 's say you have the following triples written in Turtle syntax to identify the gender and parent / child relationships of a few people :
@prefix : < http://www.snee.com/ns/demo#> . : jane : has Parent : gene .
: gene : has Parent : pat ; : gender : female . : joan : has Parent : pat ; : gender : female . : pat : gender : male . : mike :has Parent : joan .
The following CONSTRUCT statement creates new triples based on the ones above to specify who is who 's grandfather :
PREFIX : < http://www.snee.com/ns/demo#>
CONSTRUCT { ?p : has Grandfather ?g . } WHERE {?p : has Parent ? parent .
? parent : has Parent ?g . ?g : gender : male . }
When I ran this query with the data above , ARQ returned the newly constructed triples in Turtle format :
@prefix : < http://www.snee.com/ns/demo#> . : jane : has Grandfather : pat . : mike : has Grandfather : pat .
From the same little data file , we can generate triples about who is who 's aunt :
PREFIX : < http://www.snee.com/ns/demo#>
CONSTRUCT { ? p : has Aunt ?aunt .
} WHERE {?p : has Parent ? parent .
? parent : has Parent ?g . ? aunt : has Parent ?g ; : gender : female .
FILTER (? parent != ?aunt ) }
With this query , ARQ constructs these triples :
@prefix : < http://www.snee.com/ns/demo#> . : jane :hasAunt : joan . : mike :hasAunt : gene .
This is n't really creating new information , but the ability to make implicit information explicit can certainly add value to a system , especially when the rules necessary to assemble the pieces are more complicated than the ones shown above for identifying grandfathers and aunts .
How you use your newly constructed triples depends on how your SPARQL engine gives them to you .
As we saw above , ARQ writes them out in Turtle syntax .
TopQuadrant 's TopBraid Composer displays them in the window used for SPARQL query output , and after you select one or more of them , the " Assert selected constructed triples " menu choice adds them to the graph of triples that you 're currently working with .

Figuring out how to clear this hurdle has implications for our daily budget decisions and our investments , and for how organizations from resorts to charities do business .
Money is inseparable from our existence in society - we work for money , live on money , and hoard it and spend it for a tangled mix of reasons .
As psychologists unpack these insights , their work offers a powerful new way to think about this complex and poorly understood relationship .
And it gives us a chance to use our spending money , however much it may be , as a vehicle to a more fulfilling life rather than just a better accessorized one .
Any attempt to put these findings into practice , however , has to contend with the subtle but powerful ways money itself channels our thinking , and the ways it plays on human attitudes about sharing and scarcity .
Recent studies have suggested that merely thinking about money makes us more solitary and selfish , and steers us away from the spending that promises to make us happiest .
Dunn and others are beginning to offer an intriguing explanation for the poor wealth - to - happiness exchange rate :
The problem is n’t money , it ’s us .
For deep - seated psychological reasons , when it comes to spending money , we tend to value goods over experiences , ourselves over others , things over people .
When it comes to happiness , none of these decisions are right :
The spending that make us happy , it turns out , is often spending where the money vanishes and leaves something ineffable in its place .
But starting to emerge now is a different answer to that age - old question .
A few researchers are looking again at whether happiness can be bought , and they are discovering that quite possibly it can - it ’s just that some strategies are a lot better than others .
Taking a friend to lunch , it turns out , makes us happier than buying a new outfit .
Splurging on a vacation makes us happy in a way that splurging on a car may not .
Modern research generally backs them up .
Psychologists and economists have found that while money does matter to your sense of happiness , it does n’t matter that much .
Beyond the point at which people have enough to comfortably feed , clothe , and house themselves , having more money - even a lot more money - makes them only a little bit happier .
So there ’s quantitative proof for the preachings of St. Francis and the wisdom of the Buddha .
Bad news for hard - charging bankers ; good news for struggling musicians .
Can money buy happiness ?
Since the invention of money , or nearly enough , people have been telling one another that it can’t .
Philosophers and gurus , holy books and self - help manuals have all warned of the futility of equating material gain with true well - being .
Despite millennia of folk wisdom on the topic , it was n’t until a decade ago that researchers started to take a hard look at whether money really does have anything to do with happiness .
In the late 1990s , a psychologist named Martin Seligman founded the field of positive psychology , driven by the idea that psychologists had as much of a duty to figure out what made people happy as to study their problems .
At the same time , a few economists were starting to borrow the tools of psychology to challenge some of the assumptions that their field had long held about human behavior - that people were rational calculators of cost and benefit , for example , and that looking at how people spent money could be a reliable indicator of their deeper desires .
Positive psychologists and so - called behavioral economists both turned their attention to the money - happiness nexus .
Mapping financial statistics against people ’s self - reported happiness , the researchers sifted data from rich nations and poor nations , from people up and down the economic ladder , and from individuals as their economic fortunes improved or deteriorated .
The connection between wealth and happiness , they found , was pretty weak .
“ It ’s not a zero correlation , even at higher income levels , but it ’s not a very big correlation , ” says Sonja Lyubomirsky , a psychology professor at the University of California at Riverside and a leading happiness researcher .
Money , she says , “ matters less than we think it would . ”
But what if that was n’t the whole story ?
Dunn , of the University of British Columbia , remembers wondering a couple years ago whether money and happiness were necessarily so disconnected .
Partly , she was inspired by a change in her own circumstances :
She had just gotten hired as an assistant professor , her salary suddenly jumping from a post - doctoral researcher ’s $ 20,000 stipend to about four times that much .
She found it hard to believe that there was nothing she could do with some of that new money to make herself happier .
What if , for example , she spent it not on a new flat - screen television or sectional sofa , but on other people ?
One of the most consistent findings of the happiness literature is that having a strong social network is an excellent predictor of happiness , and it seemed plausible that you could use money to buy happiness that way .
She teamed up with Michael Norton , a psychologist and assistant professor at Harvard Business School , and the two embarked on a series of experiments to test whether spending money on others actually makes us happier than spending it on ourselves .
The starting point for all analysis of the ongoing bailout orgy that is currently being used in crony capitalist fashion to transfer wealth from our middle class to the financial elites and their transnational conglomerates is whether these bailouts are authorized by the US Constitution .
The answer is a resounding NO !
Nothing in the Constitution could ever be interpreted in any manner that would in any way allow the conversion of our quasi- capitalist republic into a police state , which is the last thing our Founding Fathers had in mind .
How can our government simply hand over fiat money created out of thin air , which in itself totally violates the provisions in our Constitution dealing with the issuance of money , to whoever they deem to be too - big - to - fail ?
The very idea of such targeted bailouts violates every precept upon which our nation was founded , and our Constitution in no way allows the bailout of any private person or business entity , especially where this creates special privileges to be given to a chosen few “ anointed ” entities at the expense of our citizens in general .
Regulation of interstate commerce does not mean doling out crony capitalist bailouts , which amount to nothing short of the implementation of feudalism under the Puppet Master oligarchs of our Shadow Government .
Regulation would mean fining and jailing these criminals and allowing them to fail so better run companies can acquire their assets via liquidation to be supervised by regulators .
You reap what you sow in this nation .
You do not reap profits for yourself and have everyone else pay for your losses .
That is pure poppycock detritus .
But where is our redress ?
We have a President who is a usurper pushed into office by the Puppet Masters in another violation of our Constitution that limits the Presidency to natural born citizens , we have a bogus Congress beholden to the Puppet Masters for the filling of their campaign coffers in a political system where elective offices are bought and sold based on wealth instead of ability and integrity , and we have a Kangaroo Court System where the judges know not to bite the hands that appointed them , lest their skeletons be released from their closets or worse .
Our regulators , who are in on almost every scam and public rip - off ( i.e. the Madoff debacle ) , look the other way or issue chump change fines without requiring any accountability .
The only redress left now are forceful public demonstrations , and if the President and Congress still turn a deaf ear , then there is always the Second Amendment , which is the option which we predict will eventually be used to create a change in our government from total corruption back to public service .
Obama wanted “ change , ” and that is what the American people are going to give him , not what he is going to give us .
And let ’s also make that perfectly clear to the Illuminati , whose boots Obama daily licks like a slobbering dog .
When the subprime / credit - crunch debacles first unfolded , we took the position that there should absolutely be no bailouts because such things are illegal , unfair , immoral and flagrantly unconstitutional .
You do not mess with private contract rights , or dole out special privileges to a chosen few on a whim , lest you become known as just another Banana Republic .
We are a nation of laws and legal precedents .
You do n’t throw out hundreds of years of legal precedent by subordinating secured bondholders to unsecured creditors , all with the blessing of our Supreme Kangaroo Court and its nine numbskulls , who are appropriately dressed like Darth Vader , and then expect any other nation in the world to take you seriously .
Our nation has lost any modicum of credibility and integrity , and the only nations who continue to deal with our government are the ones whose governments are even more criminal than ours is and / or who are caught in a “ dollar trap . ”
This fact alone is enough to kill the bond markets .
This total disregard of the law and of legal precedents creates tremendous risk in the minds of foreign investors , and that means higher interest rates , and lower bond values , both public and private .
And never mind the coming hyperinflation !
We deserve to have the dollar lose its reserve status and to have our treasuries rated as “ junk ” bonds based on the actions of our leaders alone , much less the state of our economy .
No contract is sacred anymore .
They just make up the rules as they go along .
When we recommended against bailouts , we initially were referring to the subprime borrowers who lied on their applications and never should have been given mortgages in the first place .
Bailing out failed financial institutions was the farthest thing from our mind because it was simply unthinkable .
Instead , we have seen subprime borrowers given token help and watched in horror as the failed Illuminist financial institutions were given the key to Goldman Sachs South and its Treasury Department .
We watched slack - jawed as the United States of America became the “ Crony Capitalist Bailout Nation . ”
If anyone is going to be bailed out , it should be the taxpayers and not the elitist transnational corporations and financial institutions who park their foreign profits offshore and do n’t pay any taxes on those profits !
COME ON !!!
But the bailouts of “ anointed ” Illuminist companies have served one purpose very well .
They have provided us with the smoking gun that proves the existence of the Illuminist agenda which we discuss in every issue of the IF .
What do we mean by that ?
As Joan Rivers would say : “ Let ’s talk . ”
Let us first say that the only sensible solution to all the ongoing debacles , other than an immediate purging of the economy which is what we recommended because it would minimize the pain of financial excess and maximize the speed of recovery , would have been to correct the defaults that were causing the various real estate and other credit derivatives to lose value .
The defaults could have been corrected by making the loans current or even by paying them off altogether .
The math is totally obvious .
Anyone with a high school diploma , a calculator and Internet access could have figured it out .
Yet apparently the people with 1600 combined SAT scores , Ivy League diplomas and many years of Wall Street experience apparently could not figure this out .
Do you really believe that ?
If so , you are incredibly naive .
You probably also believe that the psychopathic leverage , moronic lending standards and outlandish ratings on bonds and derivatives were the product of mistakes , greed and poor judgment .
Again we say : COME ON !
Y
Yes , the underlings were simply doing as they were told to get their million dollar bonuses even though they knew that what they were doing seemed very imprudent , but the people at the top , from the upper tier of the Illuminist cabal , knew exactly what they were doing .
The top dogs created the framework for the underlings to work in .
That framework was intentionally and fatally flawed by maniacal leverage , rampant fraud and total lack of any meaningful regulation .
Even a minor problem could be magnified into a major issue via excessive leverage .
And any major problem could , by that same excessive leverage , be magnified into a catastrophic financial meltdown that would destroy the US economy , and even the world economy .
You have to kill off the old system utterly , so you can install your fascistic police state and one world government in the ensuing chaos , and that is exactly what is happening right under your nose , right before your very eyes .
Does
God have to club you over the head from His throne in Heaven to get you to take notice ?
Get a freaking clue , America !!!
Now , let ’s look at some numbers .
According to mortgage loan servicers handling 64 % of all first liens , they were managing $ 34 million loans totaling $ 6 trillion dollars of which two thirds were prime loans .
That would make the average mortgage somewhere in the area of $ 175,000 .
If we add in the other 36 % of first liens , and assuming the same overall average principal for these loans , we would have a total of about 53 million first liens with an average of $ 175,000 per mortgage .
The TARP money was 700 billion dollars .
That means we could have completely paid off 4 million mortgages , or cut 8 million mortgages in half whose borrowers would then be able to easily refinance with their high newfound equity .
And Realty Trac tells us that from 2005 to 2008 , inclusive , about 7.5 million properties had foreclosure notices of default , orders of foreclosure and / or notices of sale served / filed against them .
There is a lot of double counting there because multiple filings could affect the same properties in different years and not all properties go to foreclosure , but it does give us an outside / maximum figure for loans in serious default .
All those mortgages could have been cut in half with the TARP money and saved from foreclosure , and refinanced down to affordable payments .
What would such a bailout have meant for America ?
Bear Stearns would still be here , Lehman Brothers would still be with us , AIG and the insurers would have manageable claims and still have decent ratings , all the subprime lenders would be solvent , all the Wall Street legacy investment banks and commercial banks would still be functioning and would not have become penny stocks , municipal bonds would be selling like hot cakes , the Dow might be past 14,000 , most people would still have their jobs , pensions would be flush , the real estate market would still be sledging along , and the world economy would still be humping .
And we have n’t even touched the $ 787 billion of pork from the stimulus plan , or the two trillion dollars that the Fed doled out to both foreign and domestic banks and that is still unaccounted for !
With those funds we could have paid off everyone ’s general purpose credit cards ( one trillion ) , cut another 8 million mortgages in half ( 700 billion ) , and still had over a trillion left over to take care of the defaulted car loans , student loans , commercial mortgages and future residential mortgage defaults !
Even the foreign banks could have been saved !
Why would this be so ?
Because if the defaults were cured , the de-leveraging of the big commercial and investment banks , which were , and still are , leveraged at a rate of about 50 to 1 , would not have become necessary , at least not right away .
This need to de-leverage to absorb losses when they occur by banks that are leveraged at 50 to 1 is what makes a trillion dollar problem into a 50 trillion dollar problem , and this is where we are headed when the Derivative Death - Star ignites and / or banks are forced to mark - to - market again .
All this pain could have been avoided by the curing of loan defaults .
Would it have been fair to bail out the liar loans ?
Of course not .
This drips of moral hazard .
But would you rather bail out the bankster - gangsters instead ?
Is it more fair to do what our government has done for the criminals on Wall Street ?
Heaven forbid !
And besides , the bailout of the liar loans would have automatically bailed out the bankster - gansters in any case !!!
Do you mean to tell us that the geniuses of corporate America , Wall Street and Goldman Sachs South could not figure this out ?
Again we say : COME ON !!!
But it gets even better .
We are told by our government bean counters that they think it will take about $ 24 trillion to bail out the so - called too - big - to - fail banks .
So let ’s have some fun with this money .
In the private sector , we have $ 13.8 trillion in household debt , $ 11.1 trillion in business debt , and $ 17.2 trillion in debts of financial institutions .
We could take the $ 24 trillion and totally pay off all household and business debts .
That means the financial institutions would collect all that money and use it to pay off their debts as well .
The whole system could have been de-leveraged and the derivatives canceled by regulators .
Would we have hyperinflation as a result of all this bailing out ?
Of course !
And some deflation as well .
But would you rather go into hyperinflation debt free , or in hock up to your ears ?
You ’re going to get hyperinflation whether you get bailed , or the banks get bailed .
And if you get bailed , the banks automatically get bailed .
And for those banks that were totally careless , they would get to fail and be absorbed by the thousands of good banks who would jump at the chance .
Large amounts of pain are being inflicted on you needlessly while the criminal Illuminati and their nefarious bankster - gangsters get bailed out , thus sucking all your blood out like a vampire squid wrapped around the face of humanity , as Goldman Sachs was recently described by Matt Taibbi .
This is why all the efforts to cure defaulted loans have been half - hearted at best , and non-existent at worst .
The Illuminati know that this is the best cure for the sheople , so we most certainly can not have that .
Else , how could they form their Orwellian one world police state of feudality and become lords of the universe over their future serfs ?
This whole bailout bonanza for financial criminals is the smoking gun .
This is irrefutable evidence that the leaders of corporate America , Wall Street and Goldman Sachs South are venomous traitors who want to enslave you and put you and your posterity into bondage forever !
The percentage of occupied living units in the US that were owned as opposed to being rented was about 62 % in 1960 .
All the shenanigans with Fannie and Freddie and the loosening of loan standards so that anyone breathing could have a mortgage has caused that home ownership percentage to fluctuate in an upward trend with the ebbs and flows of various real estate bubbles since that time , with a peak of almost 69 % in 2005 .
If we were to trend back to 1960 ’s 62 % ownership , some five million owners would have to become renters again .
We see this as inevitable , and it may get much worse as we move into the most disastrous state of the US economy in our nation ’s entire history .
With long - term unemployment at over 20 % , which could double if the Illuminati have their way with the ridiculous bailouts of bankster - gangsters , and with hyperinflation on its way , we could see the percentage of home ownership easily drop to 55 % , or even less .
We also see prices for housing potentially reverting back to the levels that existed at the beginning of the 1990 ’s , which is before profligate expansion of money and credit by the Fed began in earnest as the totally criminal Clinton Administration got underway in 1993 .
That wild - eyed monetary expansion by the Fed has distorted asset values across the board , and has grown worse with time to cover over the destruction of our economy via free trade , globalization , off - shoring , outsourcing and both legal and illegal immigration .
Foreclosures , coupled with much higher interest rates on account of hyperinflation and elevated risk , could potentially become bad enough to reduce the median house price to 120,000 as it was in 1991 , when the real estate market was partly cleansed .
The deflation could get even worse as our government fires up the subprime market for another round of rampant fraud which could extend defaults even beyond 2012 .
Then there is the deflation in the aftermath of hyperinflation .
It is just too terrible to even contemplate where this whole thing could go .
In our last issue , we reported that trailing P/E ratios using GAAP principals for calculating earnings were really 761 , not the reported 24 or so that was obtained without taking write - downs into account .
With a trailing P/E ratio of 761 , the stock markets would have little , if any , value .
Again , it is too ugly to even contemplate .
The next leg down in this bear market is going to be a killer .
The Illuminati are attempting to start back up where they left off when Meredith Whitney cut them off with her exposure of Citigroup ’s toxic waste , but this time it is the taxpayers who are at risk on account of continuing government bailouts of so - called too - big - to - fail legacy banks .
To accomplish this recommencement of the subprime and other derivative fraud , they have their losses held at bay with bogus mark - to - model bond and derivative values while Buck - Busting Ben lends them interest - free money which they are parking with the Fed at interest , investing in treasuries , and / or pouring back into the stock and derivative markets .
This is where all the green shoots are coming from , namely , from money created by printing press prestidigitation out of thin air by Bernanke that is being invested by Illuminist financial institutions instead of being loaned to consumers .
The dollar volume in the stock markets far exceeds the money coming out of money markets , so dollar volume and stock prices are being greatly exaggerated as a result of all this profligate money and credit .
This is yet another reason why the Fed stays silent about what institutions received all the money and credit that it has loaned out .
That would enable canny investors to trace the stock market volume to its real source , being digital dollars provided by the Fed to keep the sucker ’s rally going .
This rally mirage will come back to haunt anyone who stays in the stock market , other than owning gold and silver related shares .
Meanwhile , as all this transpires , in yet another parlor trick , Bernanke is exchanging dollars created out of thin air by the Fed for other fiat currencies also created out of thin air by foreign central banks in various currency swap arrangements .
This keeps foreign banks out of US credit markets whenever they need dollars to settle transactions , such as oil purchases and credit default swap settlements .
These swapped dollars are also used by foreign central banks to purchase treasuries in order to support the dollar and US treasury bond values , which of course helps to maintain the value of their own existing dollar - denominated reserve assets in US treasury and agency paper .
These swap arrangements are how the Fed is able to maintain the near zero interest rates in US credit markets which are crucial to Illuminist banking profits .
These swap arrangements are little more than smoke and mirrors economics .
They have to keep swapping , or interest rates in US credit markets will rise , treasury values will plummet , and the Fed will be forced to monetize more treasuries to counteract these trends .
These swaps swell the amount of dollars held by foreigners , which will come back to haunt us later when these foreigners implement big dollar bailouts and create a dollar carry trade .
This flood of dollars back to our shores will be the atmosphere that leads to dollar devaluation .
The repatriation of dollars from foreign central banks alone is more than enough to create hyperinflation , much less all the money and credit sloshing around in our national economy already as our government miscreants deficit - spend us into oblivion .
The swaps are being used to sterilize dollars , delaying the inevitable so they can continue to milk the system as long as possible .
The Illuminati may well pull the plug on the stock and oil markets to chase money into dollars and treasuries to save those markets again , which are the seat of Illuminist power , and to help fund an FDIC bailout of what could be hundreds of billions from hundreds of bank failures that would be tallied up during the upcoming bank holiday where the small fry will once again be culled out so the big bankster - gangsters can eliminate the competition and acquire their accounts and assets for pennies on the dollar .
The bank holiday would be used as the excuse for the PPT to withdraw its support from the stock markets , letting them crash under their own weight by virtue of countless negative fundamentals .
Congress is going to grant authority for the issuance of $ 500 billion in treasuries to fund the FDIC bailouts , and it is the Fed ’s hope that the flush of liquidity from the PPT ’s crashing of foreign and domestic stock and oil markets into dollars and treasuries will reduce the amount of those FDIC bailout bonds that the Fed will have to monetize .
Precious metals will undoubtedly become beneficiaries of this flushing out as well .
This will be the dollar and bond markets ’ last hurrah , and will pave the roads leading to devaluation of the dollar , and to the greatest bull market in gold and silver of all time .
The next leg up will make up for all the big profits that have eluded newer investors in precious metals thus far .
The best is yet to come .
Buy your tickets now , and make sure that you ’re already on the train when it leaves the station !
Market In Review
The Challenger job cuts rose 31 % to 97,373 month - on - month .
This is the first rise in job cuts since January .
Can you imagine the federal government is asking Goldman Sachs about its compensation packages and credit derivative instruments ?
The government will do absolutely nothing , – Goldman controls our government .
Besides supplying foreign currencies via loans to friendly countries called swap facilities , the Fed is also using this front to buy Treasuries .
The friendly countries are England , So. Korea , Singapore , Switzerland , Japan , Mexico , New Zealand , Canada , Australia , Denmark , Norway and Sweden .
The reason the Treasury reconfigured its figures on foreign central bank Treasury sales was to boost foreign participation in Treasury auctions .
That allowed foreigners to show larger auction purchase numbers to cover up Fed purchases of US Treasuries .
These swaps allowed a cover for the continued monetization via Treasury purchases and at the same time make it look like the foreigners were the buyers .
This way they do not have to continue to use secret offshore accounts in the Caribbean .
The actions could explain why the Japanese tried to smuggle US Treasury bearer bonds from Italy into Switzerland for sale before the dollar tanked .
The US is in a box and they can not get out .
They have to print money and issue credit or deflation will take charge .
We are now seeing the result of such policies in the value of the dollar as it plummets downward .
Obviously others have caught on to what the Fed is up too .
If you throw all this monetization into perspective you have to realize it ’s hyperinflationary .
Then there is the $ 2 trillion budget deficit , which could become much worse if Cap & Trade and Health Reform become law .
That could guarantee double digit deficits as far as the eye can see , never mind what fiscal madness could be cooked up over the next 3 - 1/ 2 years .
How would you feel if you were holding dollar denominated assets ?
In addition the administration ’s failed programs have to make you cringe .
Instead of applying the stimulus package quickly most of it will occur next year , which was purely a political decision , which will prove to be a costly one for the overall economy .
Put this together with the rampant corruption in wall Street and banking , the insider trading by Goldman Sachs and others aided and abetted by the New York Stock Exchange ; tremendous political pressure to disband the Fed and a public that is finally catching on to what is really going on and you have a formula for disaster .
We also should n’t forget the enablers of the Wall Street - Government crime syndicate , the SEC and CFTC , which cover up all these illegal activities .
Every large dollar holder knows going in that it has been US policy for years to inflate its currency .
They should have recognized this as a cost of doing business .
This inflation in part allowed US consumers the ability to continue to buy massive amounts of foreign products .
That meant that in time the dollar was doomed to fall in value .
Eventually dollar holders will lose 2/3’s of their dollar purchasing power via devaluation and default .
As a result of these profligate US policies we hear rumors that secret deals have been made with creditors to keep them from dumping their dollar denominated assets .
It is finally becoming clear to foreigners that today ’s American financial system is built on fraud benefiting a small group of elitists who control Wall Street , banking and our government .
Then again foreigners are not without fault .
Almost every one of them have manipulated their currencies and secretly and openly subsidized their industries .
Thus , there is plenty of blame to go around .
Inflation has continued to recede worldwide as monetization is neutralized by the pull of deflation .
We are frequently asked when is inflation going to start moving upward or where is hyperinflation ?
Be patient it is on the way .
Our financial system , after two years of crisis , still is insolvent and will continue to need massive infusions of monetized capital .
That will be especially true if the FASB changes their rules back to mark - to - market from mark - to - model .
We are looking at budget deficits of over a trillion dollars or more as far as the eye can see and we are looking at continued increasing unemployment .
That means continued massive money and credit creation .
Eventually that will bring the higher inflation and hyperinflation .
As a result of this policy of throwing money at the problem the dollar is paying a price .
It was but two months ago that we recommended the sale of the dollar and the assumption of short positions at 89.5 on the USDX .
As we write that index is at 77.60 .
We believe it is headed toward 71.18 , its former low by the end of October .
We projected all this in mid-May some three months ago .
We at that time moved based on fundamentals and in June we found the elitists at the Bilderberg Meeting in Greece decided that the dollar could no longer be defended at then present levels .
America is still a great importer of goods and the increase in the cost of goods purchased is a very strong stimulus for price inflation .
That T - shirt from China that once cost $ 1.00 would rise to $ 1.50 and soon .
The idea for the elitists is to hold the dollar decline at 71.18 .
At first they ’ll be successful , but in time that level will be broken and the dollar will fall to 40 or 50 .
It could take six months or three years dependent on what transpires .
The anecdote is gold as it has been for centuries .
Gold is wealth preservation that preserves assets whether we have inflation or deflation .
Some governments will continue to create money and credit , such as the US and England .
Some may decide to bite the bullet now , as we believe the eurozone may now be doing .
The ECB has dropped M4 from 12.8 % to 4.7 % over the last two years , which could well be an indication they have decided to enter deflationary depression – we will see .
A lower dollar 15 years ago would have been helpful for exports , but in today ’s environment a 71.18 USDX dollar would only add ½ of 1 % to GDP .
Few talk about it but chances are excellent that in September and October that the stock market could take a heavy hit , falling quickly and deeply back to 6600 on the Dow .
De-leveraging has a piece to go with banks still at 40 or 50 times deposits .
Eight to ten times is normal .
This recent bear market rally is very similar to the 1930 rally , which ended percentage - wise just about where we are presently .
Unemployment is rising and that means earnings cannot maintain .
Who will they sell too ?
Get out your parachutes ; it is time to jump .
On Thursday , there was a rumor on Wall Street repeated by CNBC that the Labor Department would adjust unemployment from January thru July by 500,000 to 1 million additional lost jobs .
This would n’t be surprising considering Washington lies about everything .
If this is true the market will be seriously affected .
Goldman Sachs made $ 100 million in trading revenue , a company record 46 separate days in the second quarter .
You can only achieve this on inside information .
In the second quarter they only had two losing trading days .
As a former trader for 25 years and official member of the Los Angeles Traders , I find that totally impossible without inside information .
They made $ 50 million a day .
These people are criminals , especially for what they have done to the gold and silver markets .
Commercial paper expanded last week up $ 10.7 billion to $ 1,076 trillion .
Asset backed paper fell $ 3 billion after being up $ 900 million the prior week , to a total of $ 434.8 .
Unsecured financial issuance fell $ 400 million after falling $ 26.6 billion the previous week .
CEO
Index , the only one of its kind , fell to 63 in July .
The overall confidence was 75.7 in May.
88.8 % rated current conditions as bad , up from 86.3 % in June and 81.6 % in May .
The employment confidence index fell 25 % with 57 % of CEO ’s expecting a continued decrease in employment in the next quarter .
More than 95 % rated the rate of current employment environment as bad , the highest level for 2009 .
0.4 % thought they were good .
Thirty - nine percent expect capital spending to drop and the consensus was we are treading water .
They thought the government is only delaying the inevitable .
33 % believe the worst is yet to come .
They think the President ’s healthcare reform if approved would have a devastating effect on the economy .
Cap & trade if passed would be equally devastating .
Rumors reach us that a major investment house will put out a call to get its clients out of the ETFs due to anticipated accounting issues .
Could it be that GLD and SLV will be exposed as Enron - type frauds ?
The continuing saga of Pat Kiley
In the ongoing saga of Pat Kiley we do not know if any money will be rescued , but we figure about $ 190 to $ 200 million disappeared .
As you know we heard rumors that large amounts of cash were dispersed worldwide to Zurich , Scandinavia , Greece , London and Panama .
We hope the FBI is about to move on this unfortunate scandal .
The number of U.S. workers filing new claims for state jobless benefits fell last week , providing another glimmer of hope that the economy may be on the road to recovery .
Initial claims for jobless benefits fell by 38,000 to 550,000 on a seasonally adjusted basis in the week ended Aug. 1 , the Labor Department said in its weekly report Thursday .
The four - week average of new claims , which aims to smooth volatility in the data , fell by 4,750 to 555,250 , the lowest level since Jan. 24 .
The tally of continuing claims — those drawn by workers for more than one week — rose by 69,000 during the week ended July 25 to 6,310,000 , the highest level since July 4 .
For months , issuers have raised credit card rates and fees at a dizzying pace .
Now , a growing number are starting to tack on new card fees for inactivity or purchases made outside the U.S .
In June , Fifth Third Bank began charging a $ 19 fee if credit card borrowers have no account activity in 12 months .
Discover now levies a 2 % fee on purchases made outside the U.S. , and Chase has introduced a $ 30 annual fee on its popular Freedom credit card .
Citigroup , meanwhile , has rolled out a policy where certain credit card borrowers who pay late are subject to a “ reinstatement fee ” to be able to redeem accumulated points for rewards .
This fee is currently $ 0 .
But it wo n’t stay that way , predicts Robert Hammer , who consults with the industry , if Citigroup finds cardholders are n’t objecting to the policy .
Citigroup spokesman Samuel Wang says , “ We currently have no plans to raise it . ”
The fees represent issuers ’ latest attempt to mitigate the effects of a credit card law passed in May , which restricts rate increases and marketing to college students .
Analysts say that because most provisions do n’t take effect until February 2010 , issuers are finding ways now to bolster their income despite consumers ’ precarious financial situations .
Issuers are “ hoping to slip in fees where they ’re least likely to be noticed , ” says Adam Jusko , founder of IndexCreditCards.com , a card comparison site .
Mortgage rates in the U.S. fell for the first time in three weeks , boosting the potential for further stabilization in the housing market .
The average 30 - year rate dropped to 5.22 percent from 5.25 percent , mortgage buyer Freddie Mac of McLean , Virginia , said today in a statement .
The 15 - year rate averaged 4.63 percent for the week ending today .
Lower rates may increase demand for homes in the fourth year of the housing recession .
New and existing - home sales rose in June as falling prices and a government tax credit lured buyers .
The S&P / Case - Shiller home price index rose 0.5 percent in May from the prior month , the first gain since July 2006 .
“ If you ’re a homebuyer and you ’re employed , you ca n’t complain , ” said Donald Rissmiller , chief economist at New York - based Strategas Research Partners .
“ Policy makers have to consider this a success . ”
Federal Reserve Chairman Ben S. Bernanke is trying to lower loan costs with a program to purchase securities backed by mortgages .
The central bank ’s purchases brought down yields on government debt and mortgage - backed bonds issued by Fannie Mae , Freddie Mac and Ginnie Mae , allowing lenders to reduce rates on new loans and still sell the securities at a profit .
The Federal Reserve ’s $ 1.25 trillion plan for buying mortgage - backed securities helped drive rates to a record low 4.78 percent twice in April .
Falling rates helped boost refinancing and purchase applications for home loans .
Rates started climbing in May along with Treasury yields on investor concern that higher government debt would fuel inflation .
The 10 - year Treasury note rose to 3.75 percent today from 3.61 percent last week .
The pace of U.S. job losses slowed more than forecast last month and the unemployment rate dropped for the first time since April 2008 , the clearest signs yet that the worst recession since the Great Depression is easing .
Payrolls fell by 247,000 , after a 443,000 loss in June , the Labor Department said today in Washington .
The jobless rate dropped to 9.4 percent from 9.5 percent .
Fannie
Mae plans to tap $ 11 billion in new government aid after posting another massive quarterly loss as the taxpayer bill from the housing market bust keeps growing .
The mounting price tag for the rescue of Fannie and its goverment - sponsored sibling , Freddie Mac , is surpassed only by insurer American International Group Inc. , which has received $ 182.5 billion in financial support from the government so far .
Fannie Mae ’s new request for $ 10.7 billion from the Treasury Department will bring the total for Fannie and Freddie to nearly $ 96 billion .
Freddie is expected to report its quarterly results on Friday .
The government has pledged up to $ 400 billion in aid for the two companies , which play a vital role in the mortgage market by purchasing loans from banks and selling them to investors .
They have been under government control since last September , when their near - collapse helped set off the financial crisis .
Together , Washington - based Fannie and McLean , Va. - based Freddie own or guarantee almost 31 million home loans worth about $ 5.4 trillion .
That ’s about half of all U.S home mortgages .
With assets of that size , “ it ’s hard for their problems to be small , ” said Karen Shaw Petrou , managing partner at Federal Financial Analytics , a consulting firm that advises financial institutions .
Fannie
Mae posted a second - quarter loss of $ 15.2 billion , or $ 2.67 per share , including $ 411 million in dividend payouts .
That compares with a loss of $ 2.6 billion , or $ 2.54 per share , in the year - ago period .
“ We are dependent on the continued support of Treasury in order to continue operating our business , ” Fannie Mae said in a Securities and Exchange Commission filing late Thursday .
The results were driven by $ 18.8 billion in credit losses due to declining housing market conditions , made worse by rising unemployment .
Nearly 4 percent of the loans Fannie Mae owns or guarantees were delinquent as of June 30 , up from 1.4 percent a year earlier .
The two companies lowered their standards for borrowers during the real estate boom and are reeling from the bust .
High - risk loans , now defaulting at a record pace , have come back to haunt the companies .
Worse still , the recession is causing formerly reliable homeowners with good credit to default .
The Obama administration is expected to unveil its plans for Fannie and Freddie early next year .
Options being considered include keeping the companies private , winding down their operations , merging them into a federal agency or separating out their bad mortgage assets into a new company backed by the government .
Meanwhile , the head of the federal agency that regulates Fannie and Freddie Mac , James Lockhart , is stepping down at the end of the month .
Edward DeMarco , chief operating officer of the Federal Housing Finance Agency , was named acting director on Thursday .
DeMarco , 49 , has worked at the agency since October 2006 .
Before that , he worked at the Social Security Administration and the Treasury Department .
Joseph Stiglitz and Linda J. Bilmes — 7/07/2009
Last week the U.S. “ stood down ” in Iraq , finalizing the pullout of 140,000 troops from Iraqi cities and towns — the first step on the long path home .
After more than six years , most Americans are war - weary , even though a smaller percentage of us have been involved in the actual fighting than in any major conflict in U.S. history .
But not so fast .
The conflict that began in 2003 is far from over for us , and the next chapter — confronting a Taliban that reasserted itself in Afghanistan while the U.S. was sidetracked in Iraq — will be expensive and bloody .
The death toll for U.S. troops in Iraq and Afghanistan reached 5,000 in June .
An additional 80,000 Americans have been wounded or injured since the war in Iraq began .
More than 300,000 of our troops have required medical treatment , and Army statistics show that more than 17 percent of our returning soldiers suffer from post - traumatic stress disorder .
Meanwhile , in Iraq , even though most of the population has long told pollsters they can’t wait for U.S. forces to leave , U.S. officials have said we are likely to station 50,000 troops at military bases in the country for the foreseeable future .
This is because the situation in Iraq is highly precarious .
Moreover , the U.S. barely has begun to face the enormous financial bill for the war .
By our accounting , the U.S. has already spent $ 1 trillion on operations and related defense spending , with more to come — and it will cost perhaps $ 2 trillion more to repay the war debt , replenish military equipment and provide care and treatment for U.S. veterans back home .
Many of the wounded will require indefinite care for brain and spinal injuries .
Disability payments are ramping up and will grow higher for decades .
The stress of extended , multiple tours to Iraq means that a whole generation of U.S. military men and women may now be suffering from long - term mental health issues .
The suicide rate in the Army is at its highest level since record - keeping began .
This wartime spending undoubtedly has been a major contributor to our present economic collapse .
The U.S. has waged an expensive war as if it required little or no economic sacrifice , funding the conflict by massive borrowing .
As we ’ve observed in the past , you ca n’t spend $ 3 trillion on a reckless foreign war and not feel the pain at home .
Burned by the difficulties in Iraq , our political leaders have no illusions about the length and difficulty of the challenge facing us in Afghanistan .
But in other respects we seem set to repeat the same mistakes that we made in Iraq .
The president has just signed yet another “ emergency ” supplemental appropriations measure ( $ 80 billion ) to fund continuing operations in Iraq and expansion into Afghanistan .
This means that for the 30th time since 2001 , war spending has been rushed through the budget process without serious scrutiny .
Obstacles continue to beset returning veterans too .
Despite an increase in the Department of Veterans Affairs budget , the backlog of disability claims has reached its highest level .
Early this year , President Barack Obama committed 20,000 troops to a “ surge ” in Afghanistan .
That , combined with a large , ongoing presence in Iraq and continued reliance on private contractors for virtually every aspect of military support , remains a recipe for staggering out - of - control expenditures .
Surely we can draw some lessons from the Iraq debacle and set aside money to care for our veterans , crack down on fraud and profiteering , and account for the true costs of the war in the budget so the American taxpayer can see what we are paying for .

Former congressman William J. Jefferson was convicted of corruption charges Wednesday in a case made famous by the $ 90,000 in bribe money stuffed into his freezer and a legal battle over the raid of his Washington office that reached the highest levels of the U.S. government .
Federal jurors found the Louisiana Democrat guilty of using his congressional office as a criminal enterprise to enrich himself , soliciting and accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in bribes to support his business ventures in Africa .
The eight - woman , four - man jury convicted Jefferson of 11 of 16 counts that included solicitation of bribery , racketeering and money laundering .
Bloomberg reports the reason for RDN ’s better earnings : Radian ’s results improved as other mortgage insurers , pressured by higher default rates , reported losses .
The insurers pay lenders when homeowners default and when foreclosure does n’t recoup costs .
Radian has rescinded , or rejected , a growing number of claims on grounds that false information voids coverage .
“ Our recent denial and recisions are much higher than historical levels , reflecting our loss management efforts to review more claims and the significant concentration of loans in our delinquency portfolio ” originated in 2006 , 2007 and early 2008 , Chief Financial Officer Robert Quint said today in a conference call .
Radian ’s provision for mortgage insurance losses was $ 142.8 million , compared with $ 449.2 million in the same period last year .
The insurer paid $ 167.7 million in mortgage insurance claims in the second quarter , compared with $ 208.8 million in the year - earlier period .
The insurer said it expects to pay between $ 275 million to $ 300 million in first - and second - lien claims in the third quarter .
The Obama administration launched a broad government effort this week to overhaul mortgage giants Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and is considering splitting the companies and putting their troubled assets in a new federally backed corporation , administration officials said .
The move would dispense with one of the biggest burdens created by the financial crisis : the hundreds of billions of dollars in money - losing home loans owned by District - based Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac .
The government has already pledged nearly $ 2 trillion , including $ 85 billion in direct aid , to keep the mortgage market working through the firms .
Goldman Sachs Group Inc. made more than $ 100 million in trading revenue on a record 46 separate days during the second quarter , or 71 percent of the time , breaking the previous high of 34 days in the prior three months .
Trading losses occurred on two days during April , May and June , down from eight in the first quarter , the New York - based bank said today in a filing with the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission .
The company made at least $ 50 million on 58 of the 65 trading days in the period , or 89 percent of the time .
Only five percent say the president ’s policies have cut the deficit , and 10 % say they have had no impact .
Thirteen percent ( 13 % ) are not sure .
The Institute for Supply Management ’s index of non- manufacturing businesses , which make up almost 90 percent of the economy , fell to 46.4 from 47 in June , according to the Tempe , Arizona - based group .
Fifty is the dividing line between expansion and contraction .
ADP Employer Services said companies cut staff last month more than economists anticipated .
The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission ’s move to ban so - called flash orders may help NYSE Euronext take back market share of U.S. stock trading at the expense of three - year - old rival Direct Edge Holdings LLC .
Senator Charles Schumer said yesterday the SEC will seek to stop the practice in which some brokers get a split - second advantage in viewing requests to buy and sell stock , after discussing the issue with Chairman Mary Schapiro .
NYSE Euronext , the only one of the top four U.S. exchanges that does n’t use flash orders , has seen its portion of the nation ’s share trading slip to 30.3 percent in the second quarter from 35.5 percent a year earlier , while Direct Edge ’s doubled since November .
“
The big existing exchanges are going to be benefiting because the pendulum is swinging back in that direction in the area of transparency , ” said Thomas Caldwell , who manages about $ 1 billion , including NYSE shares , as chairman of Caldwell Financial Ltd. and president of Urbana Corp. in Toronto .
Flash orders grew to 2.4 percent of the shares traded in the U.S. in June , three years after the practice began as a way of increasing the odds an order would be filled , according to data compiled by New York brokerage Rosenblatt Securities Inc .
Schumer said the delay in routing transactions to other exchanges makes it easier for brokerages with the fastest computers to get an edge calculating demand for a stock .
MBA Mortgage Applications up 4.4 % last week .
The pace of layoffs may be easing .
Private - sector jobs in the U.S. fell 371,000 in July , according to a national employment report published Wednesday by payroll giant Automatic Data Processing Inc. ( ADP ) and consultancy Macroeconomic Advisers .
The expected loss compares with the 350,000 drop in the ADP survey projected by economists in a Dow Jones Newswires survey .
ADP revised its June job loss figure to 463,000 , down from 473,000 first reported .
The ADP survey tallies only private - sector jobs , while the Bureau of Labor Statistics ’ non-farm payroll data , to be released Friday , includes government workers .
Economists surveyed by Dow Jones Newswires expect the Bureau of Labor Statistics will report July job cuts totaling only 275,000 , about half the loss of 467,000 reported in June .
The July unemployment rate is projected to rise to 9.7 % from 9.5 % in June .
Economists think that economic output may have stopped contracting in the second quarter , but any turnaround in the labor markets is still months away .
Joel Prakken , chairman of Macroeconomic Advisers , noted that the decline was the smallest since October 2008 , but added , “ Despite recent indications that overall economic activity is stabilizing , employment , which usually trails overall economic activity , is likely to decline for at least several more months , albeit at a diminishing rate . ”
The latest ADP report showed large businesses with 500 employees or more shed 74,000 jobs and medium - size businesses lost 159,000 workers last month .
Small businesses that employ fewer than 50 workers cut 138,000 jobs in July .
Chris Varvares , president of Macroeconomic , noted that job losses are easing in major industries .
Service - sector jobs fell 202,000 in July , less than the 225,000 average in the previous three months .
Factory employment dropped 99,000 in July , compared with the 150,000 average in the prior three months .
Varvares said payrolls are unlikely to turn up until early 2010 .
Macroeconomic forecasts the unemployment rate to peak at 9.9 % in the fourth quarter of 2009 , with the rate possibly rising above 10 % for one month or two .
ADP , of Roseland , N.J. , says it processes payments of one in six U.S. workers , while Macroeconomic Advisers , based in St. Louis , is an economic consulting firm .
In another Wednesday job report , TrimTabs Investment Research estimated that job losses accelerated last month , with 488,000 workers laid off in July , worse than the ADP estimate .
TrimTabs uses daily income - tax withholdings to the U.S. Treasury to estimate changes in employment .
“ While Wall Street is convinced the recession is over , the economy continues to shed jobs at an alarming rate , ” said Charles Biderman , chief executive of TrimTabs .
Also on Wednesday , outplacement firm Challenger Gray & Christmas said that the number of layoffs announced by U.S. companies jumped 31 % in July to 97,373 .
Challenger said that so far this year , employers have announced 994,048 job cuts , 72 % more than the 579,260 announced in the first seven months of 2008 .
Saudi Prince Bandar bin Sultan , the kingdom ’s former ambassador to the United States , is reportedly under house arrest over a conspiracy against the monarch .
Saad al - Faqih , head of the opposition group Islamic Reform Movement , told Arab - language TV al - Alam that Prince Bandar has been disappeared and the media has published no word from the ex-diplomat ’s whereabouts since nearly three months ago .
According to al - Faqih , the prince first disappeared in Britain but he returned to the kingdom shortly afterwards .
He added that after Saudi officials discovered that he had provoked 200 agents working for the Saudi security service to stage a coup against King Abdullah , he was put under house arrest .
Al - Faqih said people close to the king had disclosed Bandar ’s plots and foiled them . ]
He said Saudi sources believe that intelligence provided by some Arab countries help the Saudi monarch foil Prince Bandar ’s conspiracy .
Power struggle between members of the Saudi royal family has been common as power is shared among some 200 princes out of the estimated 7000 family members .
Known as Bandar Bush because of his close relations with former US President George W Bush , the prince is son of Crown Prince Sultan bin Abdul Aziz .
75 % of Americans and at least 276 Congress members and 19 Senators want to audit the Fed , but the Fed is fighting tooth and nail to keep everything hidden .
Most people assume that the Fed wants to keep secret the list of banks which received bailout money .
You know , something along the lines of “ we gave Goldman Sachs $ 100 billion ” .
But what the Fed is really struggling to keep hidden is the fact that the entire financial system is based on massive manipulation and fraud by the Fed and its primary dealers .
Specifically , the Fed is desperately trying to hide that many trillions of the government ’s bailouts have gone to inflating the stock market , buying up the U.S. government ’s own treasuries , and gaming the currency and gold markets .
Of course , when the New York Federal Reserve ’s “ primary dealers ” ( the dealers through which the Fed carries out its open market operations in general , and its PPT , ESF , and other schemes through ) get the huge sums of cash from the Fed , they place bets based on inside knowledge of where the money flows are going ( they also , supposedly , skim off part of the cash , but that ’s for another essay ) .
In other words , the Fed ’s primary dealers engage in insider trading and front - running on a scale which would make your normal white collar felons look like a silver nanoparticle .
Finally , the Fed is not the only central bank engaging in manipulation .
An audit would show how the Fed is playing footsie with other private central banks in an international con game .

The California dream has faded since the 1970s for many in the Golden State , according to a new Field Poll .
Just 41 percent of registered voters agree the state is “ one of the best places to live , ’’ a sharp drop from the 76 percent who thought so 30 years ago when Field first asked that question .
The survey , released yesterday , found that Republicans were the most likely to have lost that lovin ’ feeling about their state .
Just 30 percent of GOP respondents said that California remained a great place to live , compared with 80 percent in 1977 .
The decades after that year brought dramatic growth in the state ’s population , from 22.8 million in 1978 to the latest estimate of 38.3 million people , a 68 percent increase .
The Field Poll report compared Californians ’ attitudes on a range of social and lifestyle issues over the last 30 years .
Findings were based on Field Polls taken from 1975 to 1978 and from 2006 to 2009 .
Among the biggest changes found in attitude was the increasing support for gay marriage , now favored by 49 percent of Californians and opposed by 44 percent .
In 1977 , voters were opposed by a 62 - to - 31 ratio .
President Barack Obama ’s approval rating is falling on concern unemployment is rising and the budget deficit will grow , a Quinnipiac University poll shows .
Exactly half of the registered voters surveyed from July 27 to Aug. 3 by Quinnipiac said they approve of the job Obama is doing , compared with 42 percent who disapprove .
That ’s down from 57 percent approval and 33 percent disapproval in a poll taken in late June , according to results released today .
The poll found that voters disapprove of the way Obama is handling the economy by 49 percent to 45 percent .
On his effort to overhaul of the health - care system , 52 percent disapprove of his handling of the issue while 39 percent approve .
Only foreign policy offered a bright spot : 52 percent of poll respondents approved of his job on this front , compared with 38 percent who disapproved .
Quinnipiac took the poll in the middle of a controversy over Obama ’s remarks about the arrest of Harvard University scholar Henry Louis Gates Jr. Gates , who is black , was arrested on a disorderly conduct charge after a confrontation at his home in Cambridge , Massachusetts , with a white police officer .
Obama , asked about the incident during a July 22 news conference , said police “ acted stupidly ” in making the arrest .
In the poll , voters by 49 percent to 33 percent said Obama acted “ stupidly ” when he waded into the matter .
Even so , 55 percent said they approved of the way Obama is handling race relations .
The poll surveyed 2,409 registered voters nationwide and has a margin of error of plus or minus 2 percentage points .
Maurice “ Hank ’’ Greenberg , who led American International Group Inc. for 38 years until his ouster amid state and federal accounting probes in 2005 , will pay $ 15 million to settle US claims he manipulated the insurer ’s earnings .
Greenberg , 84 , and former AIG chief financial officer Howard Smith “ directed several different accounting transactions to materially affect AIG ’s reported financial results , ’’ the Securities and Exchange Commission said in a lawsuit filed yesterday in federal court in Manhattan .
Smith will pay $ 1.5 million to resolve the suit .
[ Another giant fraud , no jail time , and a penalty that is ridiculously low .
As you know Greenberg is a guiding light of the Council on Foreign Relations , and an Illuminist .
This is how the system works . ]
Transaction prices of commercial property sold by major institutional investors fell by 18 percent in the second quarter of 2009 , according to an index developed and published by the MIT Center for Real Estate ( MIT / CRE ) .
The 18.1 percent drop in the transactions - based index ( TBI ) for the second quarter is by far the biggest quarterly decline in the gauge ’s 25 - year history .
( The second - biggest down quarter was the fourth quarter of last year , at - 10.6 percent . )
This was the fifth consecutive quarterly drop and the seventh in the past eight quarters .
The index is now down 22 percent year - to - date , down 32 percent from where it was a year ago and down 39 percent from its mid-2007 peak — far greater in nominal terms than the 27 percent drop the index experienced in the previous major commercial property downturn in the late 1980s and early 1990s ( the two drops are now tied in real terms , net of inflation , at 41 percent ) , and substantially greater than the current drop in national housing prices ( about 30 percent ) .
“ The big news this quarter is not just the magnitude of the drop , but the fact that transaction volume actually increased in the presence of this decline , the first volume increase since last summer , ” said Professor David Geltner , director of research at MIT / CRE .
“ Perhaps most important , the supply - side index of the prices property owners are willing to sell at plunged a record 18.5 percent , suggesting a degree of ‘ capitulation ’ which may help to bring market prices finally to a bottom ; this is the kind of thing that could begin to rebuild liquidity in the market . ”
MIT / CRE publishes not only the price index based on closed deals , but also compiles indices that separately gauge movements on the demand side and the supply side of the market that it tracks .
The demand - side index tracks the changes in prices that potential buyers are willing to pay ( sometimes called a “ constant - liquidity ” index of the market , because it tracks how much prices would have to change to keep a constant ability to sell as many properties at the same rate of trading volume ) .
That index has now fallen steadily for all of the past eight quarters .
It fell again in the second quarter , almost in lock - step with the supply - side index , bringing the demand index now to a level 48 percent below its mid-2007 peak .
“ As is generally the case , the results posted by our index are corroborated by recent evidence from another commercial property price index whose methodology was developed at the MIT / CRE : the Moody ’s / REAL Commercial Property Price Index , produced by Moody ’s Investors Service , ” said MIT / CRE Research Technician Holly Horrigan .
“ The Moody ’s / REAL report released by Moody ’s on July 20 indicated that index dropped 16 percent during April and May alone , which by May put it already down 22 percent year - to - date and 35 percent below its 2007 peak , ” Horrigan noted .
The TBI tracks the prices that institutions such as pension funds pay or receive when transacting commercial properties like shopping centers , apartment complexes and office towers .
The MIT Center ’s TBI is based on prices of National Council of Real Estate Investment Fiduciaries ( NCREIF ) properties sold each quarter from the property database that underlies the NCREIF Property Index ( NPI ) , and also makes use of the appraisal information for all of the currently 6,000 NCREIF properties .
Such an index — national , quarterly , transaction - based and by property type — had not been previously constructed prior to MIT ’s development of it in 2006 .
NCREIF supported development of the index as a useful tool for research and decision - making in the industry .
Monster Worldwide Inc. , an online careers and recruiting firm , said its employment index edged down three points in July to 114 from 117 in June .
The current month ’s reading is 27 percent below the 157 mark seen a year ago .
On Thursday , JP Morgan again saved the stock market after disappointing retail sales data .
CBOT sources say JPM bought about 1000 SPUs after the opening collapse .

They had to have known the unemployment numbers .
They must have been passed to them by Treasury or the BLS .
There is no second foreclosure wave coming , says Sam Khater , senior economist , First American CoreLogic .
“ To say there is a second wave implies the ( current ) wave has receded , ” Khater told me .
“ I do n’t see that the wave has receded . ”
If you look at the 90 - day rate it has been heading straight up — it has not receded … the foreclosure rate and REO rates have been impacted by government tinkering in the market .
He said federal and state efforts have mostly delayed foreclosures , preventing few .
The same is true for loan modifications — they fail about half the time .
Obama ’s biggest obstacle is the 68 % of voters who rate their health coverage as good or excellent .
If Obama believes a 31 - year old with no auto or significant business experience can be the czar of GM , who will be appointed health care czar ?
Perhaps to reward rabid Hollywood support a cast member of “ Grey ’s Anatomy ” can run the US health care system .

The biggest U.S. television networks are posting declines of 15 percent or more in advertising commitments for the prime - time season starting next month , based on results at CBS and NBC .
So - called upfront sales at General Electric Co. ’s NBC will fall 15 percent to 20 percent , a person with knowledge of the matter said yesterday .
Sales were $ 1.9 billion last year , a person familiar said then .
CBS Corp. will collect about $ 2.1 billion , down from an estimated $ 2.5 billion , according to Michael Morris , an analyst at UBS AG .

NBC will is selling 70 percent of its inventory , down from 80 percent , according to the person .
Small businesses that received $ 682 million in IOUs from the state say California expects them to pay taxes on the worthless scraps of paper , but refuses to accept its own IOUs to pay debts or taxes .
The vendors ’ federal class action claims the state is trying to balance its budget on their backs .
Lead plaintiff Nancy Baird filled her contract with California to provide embroidered polo shirts to a youth camp run by the National Guard , but never was paid the $ 27,000 she was owed .
She says California “ paid ” her with an IOU that two banks refused to accept – yet she had to pay California sales tax on the so - called “ sale ” of the uniforms .
The class consists mostly of small business owners , many of whom rely on income from government contracts to keep afloat .
They say California has used them as “ suckers ” as it looks for a way to bankroll its operations while avoiding its own financial obligations .
“ Instead of seeking funds through proper channels , the State has created a nightmare , ” the class says .
“ Many of these businesses will not survive if they are required to wait until October 2009 to have these forced IOUs redeemed by the State . ”
The class claims the state is violating the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments .
It demands that California be ordered to honor its own IOUs , plus interest .
They are represented by William Audet .
Bank of America announced its intention to extend “ quantitative easing ” by another 40 % from $ 200 billion to $ 280 billion .

If you 're not one of the 100,000 lucky users who gets an invitation to Google Wave today , do n't fret .
You can check out Google Wave right here .

But first , ground rules .
Click on all images in this post to see them full size .
Uppercase " Wave " refers to the entire Google Wave product .
Lowercase " wave " refers to an individual message or document .
Think of a lowercase wave like an email or a Google Doc that you 're collaborating on with other people .
The screenshots in this post are from the Wave developer preview , not wave .
google.com , invites to which are going out today .
We 'll update this post with anything significantly new in the non-preview version when we get our grubby little paws on the proper server invitation .
Ready ?
Let 's go .
Inside Google Wave
When you log into Wave , the default view is a three - column , 4 - module layout .
From left to right , the first column includes Navigation on top ( think of this as your Inbox , Sent , and labels in Gmail ) and Contacts below ( think of this as your GTalk buddy list ) .
The second column is the list of active waves in your Inbox , and the third column is where you can start a new wave or open a wave .

Here 's what it looks like .

When someone updates a wave in your inbox , it turns bold and moves to the top of your inbox — just like email .
If a contact of yours is online , a little green dot appears on his or her icon .
All the modules are collapsible and dock themselves in the upper part of the screen .
If you 've collapsed your inbox and a new wave gets updated , it flashes green .
Here I 've clicked on new wave and minimized all the other modules to expand my workspace .

You can add all sorts of rich content to your wave , like a YouTube video , Google Map , image , links , or anything that a gadget enables .
( More on gadgets below . )
Here I 've added some colored text and embedded a video clip in my wave .

When I finish typing and click the Done button on my wave , Wave pops up the " Add participants " module so I can share my wave with anyone on my contacts list .
You can search for a contact by name , or just drag and drop anyone to the wave you choose .

Once you 've shared a wave , the magic starts to happen .
At first you 'll swoon over the ability to watch your co-waver type in real - time .
It 's weird in a good , we 're - living - in - the - future way to see another person 's cursor hard at work outputting characters , key by key on your own screen .
But you get over that novelty pretty quickly .
( Most likely your IM client can do that ; anyone who 's used collaborative editors like SubEthaEdit has seen this as well . )
Advertisement
You can reply to an entire wave like an IM or an email by clicking the reply button on a wave 's toolbar .
But what 's most cool is the ability to reply to bits of a message inline .
This lets you and your collaborators annotate the wave as you go .
For example , I gave a talk about Wave here in San Diego , and prepared my talk notes in a wave .
At the beginning , I did an audience survey to gauge the level of experience with Wave - like technology .
I was able to insert replies to the questions in Wave as I went .
( Even better would have been to have a co-presenter or note - taker do that for me . )

You can collapse or expand inline comments easily .
Here 's what the talk wave looks like with comments collapsed .
Notice the small talk bubbles on the top Audience survey section .

Here 's what that same wave looks like with inline comments expanded .

Your replies inside or to a wave can also be marked as private ; so if Jack and Jill and I are collaborating on a wave and Jill wants to tell me something about Jack in - wave that Jack should n't see , she can click on the drop - down on the upper right of a wave and choose " Private Reply " as shown .
( Click to enlarge . )

Once you 've entered your private reply , Wave prompts you to add participants to just that reply .
That 's because every reply is a wave in and of itself .
You can create a new wave from any reply or copy a wave to a new wave , too .
Besides real - time updates , another " holy crap " feature of Google Wave is wave revision playback .
If someone adds you to a wave late in the game , after lots of conversation and annotation has already happened , you can click on the playback button to see how it was constructed over time .
Think of this like a slideshow through Wikipedia page revisions .
Here 's a quick video clip of what playback looks like on a wave I was in on this morning .

Just like Gmail , Google
Wave offers powerful advanced search operators , wave tagging , file uploads ( though those are wonky for me in the dev preview ) , and saved searches .
In addition to tags , Wave also offers folders .
Folders !
The interface is completely drag - and - drop : you can grab any wave and drag it to the trash or a folder .

Wave Extensions : Gadgets and Robots
Wave is a completely extensible platform , like Firefox .
Wave extensions come in two flavors : gadgets and robots .
Advertisement
A gadget is a piece of rich content that you can add to a wave .
A few example gadgets are available in the Gadget gallery .
Advertisement
Click on the puzzle piece on a wave 's toolbar to add a gadget to the wave .
One useful gadget is the " Who is Coming ? " gadget that lets you invite folks to an event and get RSVPs quickly and easily .
Advertisement
The most useful gadget I 've seen so far is the Ribbit conference call gadget .
Add it to a wave , and everyone adds their phone number to it .
( You only see your own number , not everyone else 's . )
Click the " Start Conference " button , and everyone 's phone rings — and you 're on the phone , while you collaborate on a wave .
( Click to enlarge . )

For more on the Ribbit Wave gadget , check out Rafe Needleman 's review .
Robots are email addresses that you add to your contact list .
Then , when you are in need of their services , you add a bot to a wave so they can perform some action on its contents .
A robot can modify the contents of a wave , and several already exist that do silly to useful actions .
Advertisement
For example , Eliza the Robot Shrink ( elizarobot@appspot.com ) will chat with you about anything — useful when you 're the only one of your friends who has a Wave invite and you 've no one to talk to .
Advertisement
More usefully , the Bloggy bot ( blog-wave@appspot.com ) will publish a wave onto a Blogger blog for you .
For example , I have Bloggy in my contacts , and added it to my Wave talk wave as shown here .
Notice the " Bloggy published this wave here " message in yellow at the top of the wave .
( Click to enlarge . )

Click on the " here " link and you go to my test Wave blog , which gets the contents of that wave on it .
( Click to enlarge . )

If another Wave user happens upon that blog post , s/he can comment on it in - blog , and those new updates will show up in my Wave client .
Right now , you have to be logged into Wave to see blogged content ; but that wo n't always be the case .
Google is working on making published Wave content read - only for all users , even those not logged into Wave .
Polly the Pollster ( polly-wave@appspot.com ) is another extremely useful bot which lets you create and distribute polls to survey wave collaborators quickly .
Advertisement
Other bots do things like automatically link Twitter usernames to their Twitter page , clean up empty replies ( which proliferate quickly for some reason ) , and insert stock quotes .
I expect we 'll see tons more gadgets and bots bloom over the next year .
Here are some more featured Wave extensions , courtesy of Google .

But What Will We Use Google Wave For ?
The most frequent question I get about Google Wave is : " But what would I use it for ? "
Personally I can't wait to use it to take meeting minutes collaboratively and to co-write documents like blog posts and articles online with my editors and co-conspirators .
Instead of using something like Campfire or IRC to chat with my fellow Lifehacker editors , I could see using Wave as group chat — but with inline and private replies , which are key .
Advertisement
Right now , like all collaboration tools ,
Wave is only as good as how many of the people you work ( and play ) with have it .
Even though I was one of the developers touched by an angel , with access to the preview , I did n't actually use
Wave very much because almost zero of my actual friends and co-workers were on it .
So as far as I can see , uses for Wave in your life will open up as the product itself opens up to more users who care enough to wrap their heads around it and start putting valuable information in it .
If you 're more of a moving - pictures learner , Google 's new Wave overview video nicely illustrates some of the features I 've highlighted above .
Got questions about Google Wave ?
Post 'em up in the comments , and we 'll answer what we can .

The EU Commission has just released a press release .
They are not going to approve the Oracle takeover of Sun just yet anyway .
Instead they are launching an in depth investigation of the deal , and it 's MySQL that seems to be the issue .
Here 's the press release .
This does n't mean it wo n't happen , and the deadline for a final result of the investigation is January 19 , 2010 .
But they are certainly asking the right question , namely , what happens to MySQL in Oracle 's hands ?
The proposed transaction would bring together two major competitors in the market for databases .
The database market is highly concentrated with the three main competitors of proprietary databases 
Oracle , IBM and Microsoft  controlling approximately 85 % of the market in terms of revenue .
Oracle is the market leader in proprietary databases , while Sun 's MySQL database product is the leading open source database .
The Commissions preliminary market investigation has shown that the Oracle databases and Sun's MySQL compete directly in many sectors of the database market and that MySQL is widely expected to represent a greater competitive constraint as it becomes increasingly functional .
The Commission 's investigation has also shown that the open source nature of Sun's MySQL might not eliminate fully the potential for anti-competitive effects .
In its in - depth investigation , the Commission will therefore address a number of issues , including Oracle 's incentive to further develop MySQL as an open source database .
Is n't that exactly what you 've been wondering ?
More information on the case as it continues will be available here .
*************************
Brussels , 3 September 2009 Mergers : Commission opens in - depth investigation into proposed takeover of Sun Microsystems by Oracle The European Commission has opened an in - depth investigation under the EU Merger Regulation into the planned acquisition of US hardware and software vendor Sun Microsystems by Oracle Corporation , a US database and application software company .
The Commissions initial market investigation indicated that the proposed acquisition would raise serious doubts as to its compatibility with the Single Market because of competition concerns on the market for databases .
The decision to open an in - depth inquiry does not prejudge the final result of the investigation .
The Commission now has 90 working days , until 19 January 2010 , to take a final decision on whether the concentration would significantly impede effective competition within the European Economic Area ( EEA ) or a substantial part of it .
Competition Commissioner Neelie Kroes said :  The Commission has to examine very carefully the effects on competition in Europe when the world 's leading proprietary database company proposes to take over the world 's leading open source database company .
In particular , the Commission has an obligation to ensure that customers would not face reduced choice or higher prices as a result of this takeover .
Databases are a key element of company IT systems .
In the current economic context , all companies are looking for cost - effective IT solutions , and systems based on open - source software are increasingly emerging as viable alternatives to proprietary solutions .
The Commission has to ensure that such alternatives would continue to be available .
Oracle is active in the development , manufacture and distribution of company software , including middleware ( i.e. software that connects software components applications ) , database software and business application software and related services .
Sun offers computing infrastructure , including server and storage solutions and middleware and database software .
The proposed transaction would bring together two major competitors in the market for databases .
The database market is highly concentrated with the three main competitors of proprietary databases 
Oracle , IBM and Microsoft  controlling approximately 85 % of the market in terms of revenue .
Oracle is the market leader in proprietary databases , while Sun 's MySQL database product is the leading open source database .
The Commissions preliminary market investigation has shown that the Oracle databases and Sun's MySQL compete directly in many sectors of the database market and that MySQL is widely expected to represent a greater competitive constraint as it becomes increasingly functional .

Palm
Pre users watch out .
Palm may know a lot more about you than you would like to share .
Programmer Joey Hess found that Palm Pre 's operating system webOS sends his GPS location back to Palm every day .
Hess also found code that sends
Palm data on which webOS apps he has used each day , and for how long he used each one .
" I was surprised by this , " Hess , who bought the Pre about a month ago , told Wired.com .
" I had location services turned off though I had GPS still on because I wanted it to geotag photos .
Still I did n't expect Palm to collect this level of information . "
In its defense , Palm says the data is used to offer better results to users .
For instance , when location - based services are used , the Pre collects information to give users relevant local results in Google Maps , says Palm .
" Palm takes privacy very seriously and offers users ways to turn data collecting services on and off , " says Palm in a statement .
" Our privacy policy is like many policies in the industry and includes very detailed language about potential scenarios in which we might use a customer 's information , all toward a goal of offering a great user experience . "
Palm 's actions trigger questions about consumer privacy and the extent to which handset makers and developers are gathering and using data about buyers ' behavior .
In this case , some of the concerns may be overblown , says Charles Golvin , an analyst with Forrester Research .
Golvin cites Sun CEO Scott McNealy , who said in 1999 : " You have zero privacy .
Get over it . "
Says Golvin , " While that is certainly overstated , it is also true .
Consumers , in general are concerned about privacy but look at the number of people who are willing to give up every detail of their personal lives for the opportunity to win a big screen TV . "
Palm launched the Palm Pre on June 7 exclusively on the Sprint wireless network .
Despite some criticism around its battery life and display , consumers have appreciated the phone 's sleek hardware and the webOS operating system .
Palm built webOS from scratch for the Pre .
Hess says he stumbled on to the privacy problem while trying to find a fix for another issue .
" I bought the Touchstone ( wireless ) charger and found that the screen stays on all the time when the phone is on it , " says Hess .
" That was keeping me up at night so I started looking around to find a fix . "
Instead Hess , who works as an embedded systems developer , stumbled into the code that showed how the webOS collects data .
As with most phones and computers , the Pre reports back to Palm with data when an application crashes .
But where Palm may have erred is in how it discloses to Pre users that it is collecting this information .
" Palm says users have settings in their phone to turn this off , " says Hess .
" But , as far as I can see , I have n't been able to do that . "
Individual apps on the iPhone , for instance , often check in with users asking for permission to use location .
The iPhone itself has a setting that allows users to turn location services on or off .
For Palm lack of full and clear disclosure may be the problem .
" The question here is the level of granularity when it comes to seeking permission , " says Golvin . "
If the permission on part of the user is overarching , which seems to be the case with the Palm Pre , then it is a rather crude way of doing things . "
Palm , so far , is yet to respond to user concerns .
The company is yet to spell out clearly how users can opt out of this data - sharing service .
It has also not disclosed if it is sharing the information it collects with Sprint or other third parties .
Meanwhile , Hess is still waiting to hear from Palm .
Palm has n't gotten in touch with him since he highlighted the problem .

Here are 10 true - life hosting mistakes our customers tell us they learn from and how to avoid them .
1. Falling For The Price Trap
The call of low hosting prices is like a siren .
There are reasonable budget - hosting solutions and there are outrageously low budget hosting almost guaranteed to become a nightmare .
If the price makes you wonder how they make money then you can look forward to an extremely slow site or even denial of service because they maxed out the bandwidth .
Not good .
Trust your instincts stay clear .
2. Inexperienced Reseller or Not Researching Your Reseller
Hosting with a reseller is not a bad thing .
In fact sometimes resellers give you very good support .
But you need to do your second layer research .
Sometimes a reseller is very good all around but inexperienced especially when it came to scripts and server environments .
Some resellers also could n't accommodate customer requests because the server administrators would n't work with them under any circumstance .
This usually happens when the server administrators are bulk sellers who are disconnected from the end customer .
If the server administrators are not reliable or cannot accommodate you , do n't hope your reseller can .
Resellers should also have done their homework and know their servers as if their own .
3. Not Clearly Defining Your Requirements .
As an ongoing process you should keep a list of what resources your site needs and add to that list as you grow .
One Webmaster was changing their static HTML pages to dynamic , which meant scripts were going to be used .
Since the Webmaster did n't have a clear idea of what he would like to install and what these scripts required , he only found out after moving , the host servers were not compatible with the scripts .
He lost months of work moving the sites in and out again .
So , maintain a list .
It also makes it easier when you need to upgrade because you can show the list to your host .
If you use a service such as HostVoice the list is even more helpful because it can go out to multiple hosts at one time who'll quickly evaluate if they have what you 're asking for or not .
4. Purchasing Hosting In An Auction
It might be a good place to pick up a deal but then you 'll need to go back and review the first point .
This is not to say all auctioned hosting is completely unreliable but in case you have n't noticed auctioned items have a good deal of terms and conditions attached , usually more than if purchased through the website .
This makes your package very inflexible .
Unless you review closely those terms or if you have a small static HTML pages with little ambition for the site , stay away or pay their regular website prices .
This way the host will more likely work with your requirements .
5. Forgiving A Host 's Bad Or Limited Website
If the host can't or wo n't take time to craft an informational site of their own , most likely they wo n't be too concerned about yours either .
Cookie cutter sites are a dead giveaway .
6. Putting All The Eggs In One Basket
If you manage several sites , it seems like a good idea to have everything in one account .
You can simplify your billing and get a better deal .
Not always .
We know of some webmasters who lost hours or work time because they could n't work on anything since all their sites were down .
If your site generates income and they are interconnected , having all sites down at once is bad business .
There is an option to this though .
Ask your host if they 'll be willing to split your account across 2 or more physical servers .
7. Taking Testimonials At Face Value
Not all testimonials are created equal .
You need to ask other webmasters , talk to their customers .
If they do n't list customer names on their site , ask them if you can contact any of their customers or if they 'll contact you .
If the host refuses , beware .
Not Keeping A Record Of Their Contact Information
Most of us are happy with email , forum and live support .
One Webmaster 's host was down for days .
This also meant the host 's own site .
The Webmaster could n't contact them at all because he had n't taken the time to record a physical address or telephone number .
24/7 telephone support is still desired .
When your site is down indefinitely and you 're losing visitors even sales it 's guaranteed you 'll want to talk to someone .
9. Relying On Host Backups
This happens far too often .
When a customer 's site went down indefinitely , they were stuck .
They could n't put the site with another host because they did n't have any backups of their own .
They would have to start from scratch , which would be just as bad because the site was rather mature .
Always keep your own backups .
10 .
Trusting your host to have the latest software
Internet crime is and viruses are more prevalent than ever .
New software or the latest versions are meant to plug security holes .
A customer had their site hacked twice in 2 months only to find out the host was not up to date with their software .
Check with the host before you order what versions they are running and how often they make updates .
# 884444 +( 1346 ) - [ X ] thompson :
The best engine in the world is the vagina , it takes any size piston , its self lubricating , starts with 1 finger , and every 4 weeks does its own oil change .
It 's just a pity the management system is so fucking temperamental .
( PhysOrg.com ) --
As technology shrinks , and as it becomes possible to unplug and still conduct all of your business from a hand - held device , we demand more convenience .
And there are two entities leading the way in developing ways to make it easier to take care of business away from home : The International Air Transport Association and USAA .
One is providing airline check - in standards for mobile phones , and the other is providing a way to deposit checks using images taken with a cell phone .
Back in 2007 , the International Air Transport Association ( IATA ) announced that it would be developing a way for travelers to use their cell phones as boarding passes .
With next year 's deadline for a switch 100 % bar - code boarding passes industry - wide , it is little surprise that cell phones might be used as the boarding passes .
Already , passengers can check themselves in and print out their own bar - coded boarding passes .
( I do this regularly , especially when all I have is a carry - on . )
With the IATA system , paper would be completely eliminated .
Instead , the boarding pass , with bar - code , would be sent to the cell phone .
The bar - code could then be scanned directly from the phone 's display .
In addition to being able to check yourself in and use your cell phone as a boarding pass , it is now possible to deposit checks from anywhere using a cell phone -- assuming you are a customer of USAA .
USAA is a bank and insurer based in Texas , in the United States .
However , it boasts customers from around the world .
USAA has been aggressive in making it convenient for customers to bank from anywhere , pioneering the Deposit@Home program , which allows customers to scan images of their checks and deposit them remotely over the Internet .
Now , USAA wants to let its customers deposit checks using their cell phones .
Customers take pictures of both sides of their checks with the cell phone camera , and then , accessing their accounts through USAA 's mobile banking feature , send the images into the electronic check deposit system .
Paper checks should be voided and then properly disposed of after the deposit goes through .
This is an idea that other banks have been slow to grasp .
While other banks offer remote check deposit , they require customers to purchase special equipment and pay monthly fees .
USAA offers an example of what true customer - centered banking could be .
It is clear that technology is moving forward , and that we might soon be able to carry our entire lives in the palms of our hands .
Of course , that brings its own risks -- especially if you misplace your cell phone .

Wie man mit Abmahnungen Geld verdienen kann …
Bin jetzt auch im Club .
In welchem , fragen Sie ? Im Club der Abgemahnten .
Ja , mich hat ’s auch erwischt und das ist auch der Grund für eine fast dreimonatige Blog - Abstinenz .
Denn ehrlich gesagt , hat mich die Sache ziemlich schockiert , da ich nun wahrlich nicht täglich Post von Anwälten bekomme , die eine Stange Geld von mir haben wollen , weil ich ein bestimmtes Wort benutzt habe .
Bildquelle : Pixabay
Vor allem , wenn dieser Begriff schon seit vielen Jahren im Umlauf ist und zum einen Teil ein völlig gebräuchliches
Wort ist und zum anderen Teil beschreibend .
Doch das ist noch nicht die ganze Geschichte .
Nein , nein , denn es gibt ja noch mehrere Menschen , die diesen Begriff verwenden , nicht nur ich .
Und man glaubt es kaum , es sind auch Kunden von mir darunter , die von den gleichen Anwälten eine Abmahnung bekommen haben .
Und warum ?
Weil diese Kunden eine Workshop - Beschreibung von mir online gestellt haben .
Diese Kunden sind natürlich an mich herangetreten und möchten gern Schadenersatz haben , was in diesen Fällen auch verständlich ist , da sie mit der Sache an sich ja nix zu tun haben .
Dies multipliziert die anfallenden Kosten auf die Schnelle , wie sich jeder ausrechnen kann .
Denn es braucht jeder einen
Anwalt und zu dessen Kosten kommen dann evtl .
die Abmahnkosten – wenn schon gezahlt – gleich noch obendrauf …
Das ganze geht noch weiter …
Denn der Begriff um den es hier geht “ Büro - Kaizen ” = ‘ Büro -Verbesserung ’ wurde von dem doch nicht ganz unbekannten Unternehmen tempus ( genau , das sind die mit dem Zeitplansystem , mit dem Prof. Knobloch usw . ) durch Herrn Jürgen Kurz meines Wissens bekannt gemacht bwz .
“ erfunden ” .
Da ich in dem Thema ( Selbst ) Organisation schon sehr lang drin bin , hab ich auch den Newsletter von Herrn Kurz ( übrigens sehr empfehlenswert ) schon sehr lang abonniert .
Der älteste mir noch vorliegende Newsletter in dem der Begriff genannt wird , stammt von 2006 , wobei es den Begriff von ihm schon einige Jahre länger gibt .
So , und jetzt dürfen Sie drei mal raten … Genau !
Jürgen Kurz ist natürlich auch abgemahnt worden .
Das macht doch langsam richtig Laune , nicht wahr ?!?
Natürlich möchte ich jetzt das Rätsel auflösen , wer denn nun hinter dieser Abmahnorgie steht :
Es ist die Steuerkanzlei SKG / Consulting aus Magdeburg – vertreten durch die Anwaltskanzlei RAe Brehme und Kollegen ebenfalls aus Magdeburg – die im Oktober letzten Jahres (! ) den Begriff als Marke eintragen hat lassen .
Zu einem Zeitpunkt bei dem der Begriff Büro - Kaizen schon seit Jahren in großem Maße publiziert und ( nicht nur ) von seinem Entwickler eingesetzt wird .
Ein Schelm , der Böses dabei denkt …
Und mal ganz simpel gefragt :
Wie vertrauensvoll wirkt eine Steuerkanzlei / Consulting auf Sie , die einen Begriff schützen lässt , der von jemand anderem entwickelt wurde und seit vielen Jahren eingesetzt und bekannt gemacht wird , dann an die , die sich über google zum Wort “ Büro - Kaizen ” finden lassen ( so kommt es mir zumindest vor … ) eine Abmahnung sendet , im gleichen Atemzug noch Kunden einer ‘ Wort - Verwenderin ’ ( sprich mich ) abmahnt und damit einen Verstoß gegen das Wettbewerbsrecht begeht ( es handelt sich dabei um eine Abnehmerverwarnung ) und sich dann noch gewissermaßen tot stellt , da seit Wochen keine Antwort mehr auf unsere Schreiben kommt ???
Sollte ich den Anschein erwecken , dass ich etwas geladen bin , dann könnten Sie damit durchaus richtig liegen .
Diejenigen die mich kennen und / oder meinen
Blog schon länger lesen , wissen , dass ich ein zutiefst friedvoller Mensch bin und keineswegs dazu neige , auf andere loszugehen .
Doch mal ganz ehrlich , irgendwann langt’s .
Es geht mir keineswegs darum , Schutzrechte vom Tisch zu wischen .
Wo sie korrekt eingesetzt werden , finde ich sie äußerst sinnvoll und wichtig .
Doch in diesem
Fall gibt es mehr als einen Verdachtsmoment darauf , dass hier ein Schutzrecht missbraucht wird um daraus Kapital zu schlagen .
Und ich muss noch etwas ganz klar sagen , ohne die absolut professionelle Unterstützung meiner Anwälte hätte ich nicht gewusst , wie ich mit all dem umgehen soll .
Denn wie schon erwähnt , lagen hier auf einmal mehrere Rechnungen über insgesamt einige tausend Euro herum .
Und dass meine Kunden natürlich auch nicht begeistert sind , ist ja wohl klar , und Rechtsbrüche begehe ich ja nun auch nicht jeden Tag , so dass ich darin Übung hätte… .
Hab halt einfach nur meinen Job gemacht , dachte ich …
Die Sache ist bis jetzt keineswegs vom Tisch und zieht sich inzwischen über mehrere Monate .
Und so wie es aussieht , sind wir bestimmt nicht die einzigen , die eine Abmahnung wegen der Verwendung des Begriffes Büro - Kaizen bekommen haben und daher starte ich den folgenden Aufruf :
Sollten
Sie oder jemand den
Sie kennen , ebenfalls in dieser Sache abgemahnt worden sein , bitte melden Sie sich bei mir !
Am einfachsten per email an info@wissensagentur.net
Auch – und vor allem – wenn
Sie bereits gezahlt haben , denn es bestehen gute Chancen , dass die Marke beim Patentamt wieder gelöscht wird und damit verbunden besteht für Sie die Möglichkeit den Abmahnbetrag inkl .
Ihrer Anwaltskosten geltend zu machen .
Darüber hinaus bin ich über jeden Blogbeitrag und Trackback der zu diesem verlinkt , euch / Ihnen sehr dankbar !
In diesem Fall bitte ich wirklich euch , die Netzgemeinde um Unterstützung , da eine potentielle Abmahnung über jedem von uns wie ein Damoklesschwert schwebt , der sich hier im Internet öffentlich bewegt .
Mögen manche Abmahnungen berechtigt sein , sind es einige – meiner Meinung nach – nicht und ich weiß , wie das Gefühl ist , so einer Situation erstmal hilflos gegenüber zu stehen .
Daher schon jetzt vielen
Dank an alle , die helfen diese Sache bekannt zu machen und damit all denjenigen , die auch betroffen sind , eine Chance zu geben , für sich einen guten Abschluss zu finden .
Sea Lions that live off the coast of California have been starving and dying by the hundreds , because of commercial overfishing .
The California Dept of Fish and Wildlife should be overseeing the welfare of the seals for the seals ' sake as well as from a general ecological standpoint .
This summer in July , there has been a major starvation event with the sea lions that live along the coast in California .
Residents have reported to the Marine Mammal Center and other government agencies that they were finding dying and dead sea lions at the beaches , dead from dehydration and starvation .
One sea lion named Fruitvale , was found on a highway , lost and starving .
The police picked him up and brought him to the Marine Mammal Center where he was fed and regained his health , and they released him back to the ocean .
News people have been contacting the Marine Mammal Center frequently to try to find out what is going on , why is this happening .
The Marine Mammal Center itself on its website talks about how there have been hundreds of starving seals brought to their center , where some have been able to be rehabilitated , and many more have succumbed to starvation .
Articles on this event have pointed out that at the same beaches where dead sea lions were found , out in the waters , fairly close to shore could be seen several fishing boats , fishing for sardines .
A net from one of the sardine boats broke , and thousands of sardines washed ashore .
The news articles also sum up by talking vaguely about El Nino , even though the El Nino has not arrived and so logically would not be responsible for these seals ’ deaths .
To place the blame on something like El Nino , that scientists know more about than the average citizen , lulls the reader into thinking that this is somehow part of a natural occurrence , and out of the hands of humans to fix or intervene with .
There is also talk of the sea lions being overpopulated and that this is a natural occurrence to curb their population size .
But this is not true either .
The majority of the sea lions that were found starving or dead were yearling sea lions or their mothers , who could not leave their baby ’s side .
They had to forage for fish close to shore , because they are not developed enough to go farther out to sea .
There were simply not enough fish close to the shore for the sea lions to feed on .
When a population grows to large for the food supply , there are many adjustments in population growth that take place , not a huge starvation in one season .
It is abnormal for this massive a number of sea lions to die from lack of fish .
The reason there are not enough fish , is because of commercial overfishing in the area , removing all food stocks from the waters , so that there is literally nothing for the seals to eat .
Additionally seals get their water from the fish they eat , so without fish , they also die of thirst .
In one of the news articles , a California Fish and Wildlife representative made some remarks about the starvation , only to divert attention away from concrete explanations .
Instead of talking about what fish the sea lions eat that were not there , he only mentioned that it was not because of the sardine fishing , because the sea lions were starving before the sardine season in July .
He does not say what fish were taken in the prior seasons of April , May and June , that could have caused an absence of those fish in the coastal waters .
The California Department of Fish and Wildlife regulates the seasons for fishing and provides licenses to fish , and so all of this information is available to them , veritably at the tips of their fingers .
They are the experts on what fish are being fished and by whom , during what dates .
So they should be the ones best able to provide some answers as to what caused this starvation , other than the El Nino that has not come yet .
Also the Marine Mammal Center is getting flooded with calls from concerned citizens along with some donations to try to help the starving sea lions .
However there is no mention on their website of trying to get to the bottom of the problem , namely how and when and by whom was their overfishing to such an extent that there were no fish available to the young sea lions and their mothers .
Could n’t there be an investigation , a communication from the Marine Mammal Center to the fish experts at the Department of Fish and Wildlife ?
The State of California does care about the seals and sea lions that live along California shores .
Recently Governor Arnold Schwarzenegger helped pass legislation protecting the harbor seals that lay on a small beach in La Jolla .
The residents of La Jolla appreciate the seals there and want them to have a place to rest .
The Ano Nuevo State Reserve in California , south of San Francisco , has been a very popular place for tourists and residents to come and see sea lions and elephant seals laying on the beach .
Their beauty and wildness fills visitors with awe and deep feeling of satisfaction to be able to see such enchanting creatures close up and living free .
In Santa Cruz , is the large marine aquarium that brings in millions of interested and curious tourists .
Could n’t they also serve the animals they make money from by helping solve this problem of starvation of sea lions ?
The residents of California feel the distress of the starving sea lions .
They have a feeling of responsibility and deep connection to the welfare of these wild creatures .
Most people are unaware of the state of affairs with fish populations in the wild .
Due to growing human populations and the use of fish for not only regular meals , but also being used to feed livestock , the populations of all fish are endangered .
Their numbers are dropping steeply to a point where they may never recover .
Already in California and Oregon , the season has been closed indefinitely for salmon .
Very likely the same will apply to Washington soon enough , since it is the next state up the line .
Even though it is overfishing and dams causing plummeting of salmon populations , the Oregon and Washington Department of Fish and Wildlife are killing male sea lions who travel up to the Columbia River in search of food in the early spring .
So while people are donating money to try to save starving sea lions in California , the sea lions are being killed for searching for some fish in northern waters of Oregon and Washington .
The picture clearly emerges of a kind of thievery of the oceans of the fish , and the sea mammals whose lives depend on those fish .
The United States passed the Marine Mammal Protection Act in 1972 to protect seals and whales from being killed by humans .
This should also include protecting the animals from starvation , brought about by human hands , because of overfishing .

Article on decline of fish in the Pacific from California Wine and FoodThree West Coast Fish Make Top Ten Most Imperiled Marine Fish ListPORTLAND , OR - To mark Seafood Month this October , ocean conservation groups announced the ten fish with the lowest population levels of fish in U.S. ocean waters that have been assessed and managed by the federal government .
The National Marine Fisheries Service ( NMFS ) announced this week that seafood consumption has increased since 2002 , yet many popular fish are already , or soon will be , missing from fish markets .
Populations of all of the fish on the list have declined 90 percent - or more - from estimated levels prior to directed fishing , according to the federal government .
The fact that so many fish are at such very low levels demonstrates the need for better management of our oceans .

I just added a concluding slide to my updated Perl Myths talk .
Having comprehensively debunked some myths with hard facts about perl and its ecosystem , I wanted to end with a slide that summarized some truths .
I liked the slide text so much I wanted to share it with you :
Perl : has a massive library of reusable code
has a culture of best practice and testing
has a happy welcoming growing community
has a great future in Perl 5 and Perl 6
is a great language for getting your job done
for the last 20 years , and the next 20 !
It would make more sense after seeing the talk , but I think it stands well on its own as a summary of Perl .

Easy Web Spidering in Ruby with Anemone
By Ric Roberts
Anemone is a free , multi- threaded Ruby web spider framework from Chris Kite , which is useful for collecting information about websites .
With Anemone you can write tasks to generate some interesting statistics on a site just by giving it the URL .
Its only dependency is Nokogiri ( an HTML and XML parser ) .
Other than that , you just need to install the gem to get started using Anemone 's simple syntax which , among other things , allows you to tell it which pages to include ( based on regular expressions ) or define callbacks .
This example taken from Anemone 's homepage prints out the URL of every page on a site :
require ' anemone ' Anemone.crawl ( " http://www.example.com/ " ) do |anemone| anemone .
on_every_page do |page| puts page.url end end
The bin folder in the project contains some more in - depth examples , including tasks for counting the number of unique pages on a site , the number of pages at a certain depth in a site , or a list of urls encountered .
There 's also a combined - task which wraps up a few of these , intended to be run as a daily cron job .
You can install Anemone as a gem or get the source from Github of course , and there 's some fairly comprehensive RDoc documentation available in the source or online .
DETROIT 
Gone are the cheery promises of earlier city leaders about how Detroit is on the way back .
How some new project downtown is surely just the first sign of a renaissance afoot .
How things are not so bad .
Instead , Dave Bing , Detroit ’s mayor of five months , delivers grim news by the day .
Detroit ’s bus service will be cut , he said , and 230 city workers will be laid off next week .
Those layoffs are among more than 400 since he took office , and more are possible .
Within a week , he is expected to announce how he will  through elimination , consolidation , outsourcing  shrink a city bureaucracy built for an earlier , booming Motor City .
“ We ’ve got to focus on being the best 900,000 populated city that we can be and stop thinking about ‘ We can turn the clock back to the 1950s and ’ 60s , ’ ” he said , referring to a time when the city , still the 11th most populous in the nation , was nearly twice as big .
“ That era is gone . ”
The trailer for Avatar .
Avatar takes us to a spectacular new world beyond our imagination , where a reluctant hero embarks on a journey of redemption and discovery , as he leads a heroic battle to save a civilization .
The film was first conceived by Cameron 14 years ago , when the means to realize his vision did not yet exist .
Now , after four years of actual production work , Avatar delivers a fully immersive cinematic experience of a new kind , where the revolutionary technology invented to make the film , disappears into the emotion of the characters and the sweep of the story .
China executes more people than any other nation China is to reduce the number of people it executes to " an extremely small number " , a top court official says .
Zhang Jun , vice - president of the Supreme People 's Court ( SPC ) , said the court would in future impose more suspended death sentences .
Two years ago China gave the SPC power to review death sentences handed down by lower courts .
That has already led to fewer executions .
Rights campaigners says China executes more people than any other country .
Mr Zhang , quoted in the state - run China Daily , said legislation would be improved to reduce the number of death sentences , and that the SPC would tighten restrictions on the use of capital punishment .
He said : " As it is impossible for the country to abolish capital punishment under current realities and social security conditions , it is an important effort to strictly control the application of the penalty by judicial organs . "
' Ten - year low ' China does not release figures on the number of people it executes .

More from BBC World Service
But in September 2007 , after the SPC was given its power to review cases , Chinese state media reported that executions were at a " 10 - year low " .
Amnesty International said China executed 1,718 people in 2008 - 72 % of the world 's total .
The death penalty still applies to 60 offences in China , including non-violent crimes such as tax fraud and embezzlement .
Mr Zhang told the China Daily that the SPC had been working to ensure that the death sentence was imposed only on those who had committed extremely serious or heinous crimes that led to grave social consequences .

1997 The newspaper The Independent on Sunday launched a " Decriminalise cannabis " campaign .
They , like us , believed that a change would come with the newly elected Labour government but they and we were wrong , but they did organise a big demonstration in London in March of 1998 before dropping the campaign .
These large demonstrations became an annual event fpr spme time thereafter , although they were no longer organised by the newspaper .
2000 After four long years of attempted repression of cannabis under the first Labour Administration of Tony Blair , the climate of opinion began to change .
In September of 2000 , at the Tory party conference , the then shadow Home Secretary , Anne Widdecombe to make her keynote speech which was to be in the tradition of firm support for the issue of law and order .
She announced that the next Conservative government would have a " crack down " on cannabis and she even proposed on the spot fines for simple small scale possession .
The media and the police tore the speech apart as unworkable and even undesirable .
Several Tory MP 's admitted past use , the crack down on cannabis was over .
2001
At the start of the new administration in June 2001 the police in Lambeth , South London announced that they would no longer give anyone found in possession of cannabis a criminal record and the issue of legalisation became a major issue in the campaign for the leadership of the Conservative party .
We began to hope change was close
2001 October :
The government sets up a Select Committee to look at drugs policy .
When giving evidence the Home Secretary ( David Blunkett ) announces his intention to move cannabis from class B to class C , making possession a non-arrestable offence .
2004 January :
The long awaited reclassification finally happened , but the law relating to Class C drugs was changed so as to make most of the changes meaningless .
The government spends 1 million pounds on an advertising campaign to tell people nothing had changed and that Cannabis is still illegal .
2005 Reefer madness V2 launched by the mental health charities RETHINK and SANE , drawing attention to research which claimed to show a link between cannabis use and serious mental illness .
The campaign was used as a platform to oppose the reclassification to class C and over the next four years a series of alarmist and totally inaccurate newspaper reports carried scare stories of a dangerous new version of cannabis - " skunk " - said to be 30 or more times stronger than cannabis used to be .
The ACMD examines the issue and recommends no change to the classification of cannabis and the Home Secretary Charles Clarke agrees to keep it where it is , but orders a total review of the drugs classifications .
Clarke is replaced shortly after and his review is scrapped .
2007 Tony Blair finally stands down to widespread relief , but is replaced by Gordon Brown who announces his intention to move cannabis to class B again .
The issue is returned to the ACMD for their advice upon which the decision would normally have been based .
2008 ACMD reports that cannabis should remain class C. Research carried out for the Home Office butnot made public for over a year is leaked by the Guardian and shows incidence of psychosis has actually dropped during the time cannabis use increased ( see here ) .
Gordon Brown ignores the ACMD advice and announces cannabis will be returned to class B. UKCIA loses it 's webhosting and moves to a new server .

Arctic ice reveals last decade was hottest in 2,000 years
The Arctic is now warmer than at any time during the last 2,000 years , according to a major new study .
Temperatures around the North Pole have dramatically increased in the last 50 years - reversing a long - term natural cooling trend , scientists say .
The study , based on an analysis of ice cores , lake sediments and tree rings , provides compelling evidence that greenhouse gases released since the start of the industrial revolution are triggering global warming , the researchers say .
Researchers secure a floating platform in Alaska to take sediment cores .
They reported finding yet more proof that global warming was a dangerous reality
Lead author Darrell Kaufman of Northern Arizona University said : ' Scientists have known for a while that the current period of warming was preceded by a long - term cooling trend .
But our reconstruction quantifies the cooling with greater certainty than before . '
The research - published in the journal Science - comes from a team of British and American geologists who tracked summer Arctic temperatures to the time of the Romans by studying natural signals in the landscape .
Their reconstruction found that the Arctic got cooler in the summer months between 1AD and 1900 , thanks to a natural ' wobble ' in the Earth 's orbit around the Sun .
A crying face is revealed in a melting ice cap in Norway
The wobble slowly increased the distance between the Earth and the Sun during the Arctic summer , reducing summer temperatures by around 0.2C every thousand years and causing the ' Little Ice Age ' that led to freezing winters in the 17th , 18th and 19th centuries .
But during the 20th century , temperatures began to rise dramatically - even though the amount of sunlight reaching the Arctic during the summer was continuing to fall .
The decade between 1999 to 2008 was the warmest in the last 2,000 years , the research found .
The researchers say the Arctic should still be cooling because the Earth is now about 600,000 miles farther away from the Sun than it was in 1BC .
They estimate that by the middle of the century , summer Arctic temperatures were about 0.7C higher than would have been expected if the cooling trend had continued .
Today , temperatures are around 1.4C higher than they should be , the authors say .
Dr David Schneider , from the National Centre for Atmospheric Research in Colorado , said : ' This result is particularly important because the Arctic , perhaps more than any other region on Earth , is facing dramatic impacts from climate change .
' This study provides us with a long - term record that reveals how greenhouse gases from human activities are overwhelming the Arctic 's natural climate system .
' Greenhouse gases are overtaking a natural cycle . '
The temperature reconstruction looked at the amount of algae in sediments in Arctic lakes - which reflect the length of the growing season - and the thickness of annually deposited layers of sediment which increase during warmer summers when deposits from glacial melt water increases .
According to Greenpeace , Greenland 's ice sheet has more than doubled its contribution to sea - level rise in the last seven years due to a rapid and unpredicted loss of ice
They also looked at records of tree rings .
The amount of new growth of a tree each year is strongly linked to the temperature of the growing season .
The Arctic appears to be particularly vulnerable to changes to the Earth 's climate .
Previous research has shown that Arctic temperatures rose three times faster during the 20th century than the rest of the Northern Hemisphere .
Some experts have predicted that the Arctic could be free from sea ice in the winter within the next few decades if the temperatures continue to rise .
Joanna Lumley glides into the screening room .
" Hallo , lovely people ! " she purrs at the group of journalists assembled to view her new TV documentary , Cats , and to pose a few questions to the woman famed for being Purdey , Patsy and , more recently , Goddess of the Gurkhas .
In dark trousers , blue top and elegantly swathed scarf , Lumley sits at the front of the room smiling down beatifically at the arc of Dictaphones set out before her , answering questions about every kind of cat .
She jokes about the cat rock band she met in Chicago who play the drums in return for salmon , and about the cat - owners who dress their pets as frogs , cows and mice .
She seems fantastically good fun .
Lumley 's last cat was a handsome tabby named The Bee , who died some time ago .
" The Bee was heaven , " she says , in a warm , sad kind of way .
We have moved to a quiet room set out with a coffee table , sandwiches and cakes and fancy yoghurts in long - stemmed glasses .
" He thought he was a dog , I think , because when I used to go and post letters in the village where we lived down in Kent , he would walk down the village street with me .
Right up to the post box , then walk back again . "
She smiles .
" And he was a great companion cat , so he would always come if I was gardening or if Stephen [ Lumley 's husband , the conductor Stephen Barlow ] was clearing stuff or washing the car .
He would always sit , and watch , and be with you . "
She had no hesitation , therefore , when ITV approached her to present a documentary series about cats .
" Leaped at it ! " she declares .
" I was very jealous of Martin Clunes , having done the dog one . "
Lumley makes this kind of statement with such effervescent charm , like the perfect hostess complimenting your dress , that it is only afterwards you wonder if it was true .
This is of course part of her enduring appeal , a kind of jovial bewitchery , and a voice that is soft and fragrant and as perfectly English as gin .
How , I ask , attempting an awkward segue into non-feline matters , did it feel to have recently been declared a goddess by the people of Nepal , following her successful fronting of the Gurkha Justice Campaign ?
" Well , it 's beyond comprehension actually , you know ? " she says modestly .
" Somebody explained to my son Jamie who was out there , that in Nepal they believe that if the gods can't handle something , a problem , they pick somebody out and send them to earth to solve the problem , and the person who solves the problem is called a god or a goddess .
And because my head was above the parapet , because my face was the identifiable one of our team – we were a team – they maybe saw me as that person who had been sent to sort the problem . "
Not a frightening god , mind .
" I do n't have it in me , " she says .
" I do n't lose my temper .
I used to , but I realised I would probably die of a brain haemorrhage .
So I 've governed myself not to mind about things .
I have no road rage or anything like that .
Because it 's life - shortening .
And also there 's no need for it ; it uses up energy .
I do n't mind not eating , or sitting in the bad part of a restaurant or being snubbed , it does n't really matter to me very much .
So I do n't think I 'm much of a god , because I do n't have the good snappy nature that would throw a thunderbolt . "
Instead , Lumley has learned the subtle art of persuasion – to which anyone who witnessed her confrontation of immigration officer Phil Woolas would attest : at the BBC Westminster offices in May , Lumley , incensed by the rejection of appeals for residency by five Gurkhas , pursued Woolas around the studio and forced him into an impromptu press conference , in which he agreed to further talks on the matter .
The BBC 's political editor Nick Robinson declared that he had rarely seen such a scene in his whole career .
" Well , " explains Lumley , gently , " with Mr Woolas we had just come from a room where we had been talking with the lawyers and [ Liberal Democrat ]
Peter Carroll for about half an hour about what the next step would be , and in that press conference all I was doing was saying aloud and corroborating with him what was said .
But it looked a little bit as though I was giving him a tough time .
So to make up for that I did invite him round for supper . "
Did he come ?
Lumley smiles slowly , broadly .
" Yeah , " she says .
" And he brought two friends and we had fish and chips and champagne by candlelight . "
There is , she argues , a logic to taking a more nuanced approach to browbeating .
" The thing about water is it 's strong , " she says .
" And a river running down , if you dam it , it 'll break the dam .
So find a way round , but do n't stop something .
And if you can find a way round it 's usually much better .
And people do n't get hurt – there 's no reason for that .
And people do n't lose face , which is terribly important .
But if a change of mind can take place in their own minds , rather than being forced to it , I think it 's the best way to do anything . "
She pauses .
" I 'm a vegetarian and I long for people to eat less meat , " she adds , " but the thing to do is not to go , ' Eat ! Less ! Meat ! "
It 's to say I am fit as a flea and I 'm 63 , I have n't eaten meat for 40 years , and I never get diseases , I 'm never ill , and I 'm full of energy .
So how 's about that ? "
It 's an approach she claims to have learned from her mother 's father , a diplomat .
" I love diplomacy , " she says .
" I love courtesy and kindness . "
She describes her huge disappointment at Britain 's failure to pursue a diplomatic solution to the escalating problems in Iraq .
" My father , having been a soldier , said : ' You should do everything on the planet before you go to war . '
It is such a dreadful thing to do .
War is so indefensibly dreadful .
All frontline soldiers know that , know how utterly ghastly it is and that you must never go there again light - heartedly .
So anything that stops conflict , I 'm all for that . "
It was Lumley 's father , of course , a Major in the 6th Gurkha Rifles , who inspired her campaign .
" Soldiers are necessary , " she says .
" And the thing about the Gurkhas is that if things have to be done , they just do it without any kind of malice .
They 're just utterly efficient machines for doing what they do .
Machines is the wrong word , but . . .
It seems to me a good thing to do , a brave thing to do , to protect people .
I have the highest regard for people who guard us , which is policemen and the armed forces . "
Earlier this year , as the country was afflicted by Lumley - fever , as there were cries of , " Lumley for PM ! " and the people of Nepal named a mountain in her honour , there were still one or two detractors , those who claimed that allowing the Gurkhas UK residency would deprive the already poor nation of Nepal of the financial support provided by the soldiers ' pensions .
Lumley rolls her eyes a little at the mention of it .
" Yes , we 've checked that out , " she says firmly .
" It 's going to be far better , farrrr better . . . " she stretches the word like a piece of elastic .
" If any of them work over here they 'll make far more than they get on a pension .
All the Asian communities here send money back home .
Lumley has spoken before about the fact that she has throughout her career played good people , from the crime - fighting Purdey to the Bolly - swigging Patsy , via a brief turn as Ken Barlow 's love interest in Coronation Street .
Add this to her Gurkha campaign and the 60 charities she supports , from Wateraid to Tibetan refugees , orphanages and schools , supporting the Pastoralists in the Horn of Africa and the Born Free Foundation , and you begin to sense that she is acutely aware of the importance of being good .
" God yes ! " she says at the suggestion .
" Terribly easy to be bad !
It 's easy - peasy to kill something or break it !
I 've never been remotely impressed by people with guns killing people in films , it 's nothing to me .
Of course you can kill people !
I could get a gun out and shoot you dead now , you 're dead , it does n't make me powerful , it 's just completely stupid . "
Indeed two years ago , she legendarily confronted a gunman in a Sheffield bar , engaging him in polite conversation until the police arrived .
" Being good , however , is fabulously hard , " Lumley continues .
" And we all fall off at every fence , you know ?
And there 's nothing wet about being good !
I think sometimes there 's something quite wet about being bad ! "
Badness , she explains , comes in various degrees .
She rumples her brow .
" I hate the hand that comes out of a car and just drops litter in the street , " she snaps .
" I hate that !
For some reason it just fills me with fury !
It 's just utter laziness , lack of interest in other people , lack of interest in the planet , in the hedgehog who might eat the plastic bag , it 's a lack of concern . "
Would she tell someone off ?
" Yes , but not horribly , " she says .
" I would package it up and say , ' I believe you dropped this . ' "
Her voice is buttery .
" And if they were horrid I would think of a different way of dealing with it . "
She pauses , smiles , leans a little closer .
" I 've got to tell you in service stations on big motorways I always clean up the ladies loo .
I pick up all the bits of hankies , I tidy up the bins , I get using the towels , I clean the tops , I shut the doors , I pull the plugs . . .
Because people live like animals .
And surely if it looks nice people wo n't go on making it look so bad ?
If you walk into a midden of filth maybe you just do n't care about it ?
But it does baffle me how people can behave so badly . "
It is perhaps this deep - rooted belief in goodness , along with a pervading sense of sleeve - rolling practicality and her glamorous fearlessness , that make her such a fine documentary host .
There is something to be said , too , for that famously mellifluous voice .
" I do n't know , " she says lightly .
" If you 're in something you do n't ever hear it .
And I 'm lucky , believe me , I 'm lucky .
I get as many offers for drama as I do documentaries . "
Earlier , in the screening room , she had dismissed talk of ageism on screen , arguing that women of her age should n't expect to get the roles of a 23 year old .
" I was never offered them , " she says now .
" I mean I was 30 when I got Purdey .
So I was never playing Juliet at 14 . "
Not that she would have wanted them anyway .
" I 've never been interested enough to have a career trajectory , " she continues .
" I 've never had any ambition , or thought of what I should be doing or had any idea of what I 'd like to do .
Never .
And still do n't .
And if something comes along I say fine .
It 's like food , I like it , " she waves at the spread on the coffee table , untouched , " those sandwiches there , they look fine , I would n't have ordered them , but now that they 're here they look fine .
So that 's how my acting is . "
She stops for a moment and looks at the sandwich platter .
" But if I had been a raging beauty I would have gone to America I imagine , and made a career out there .
Because you can't do that over here ; this country slightly despises beauty , and so all our lovely , lovely ones go and make a hit of it over there .
The Catherine Zeta Joneses and the Kate Beckinsales . "
It comes as something of a surprise to discover that the much lusted - after Lumley should n't consider herself a raging beauty .
" No , never !
And never was ! " she insists .
" I must tell you this .
But I had a useful face .
I could work with it – like my hair , it 's not nice but it 's useful , it can be dyed different colours , go up and go down .
And so I always saw myself as a character actress , which anyone in their right minds would rather be than a beauty actress .
Beautiful is very boring . "
Still , that useful face of hers , that voice , that charm , have brought an enduring appeal for Lumley , who has remained for more than 30 years one of the most popular faces on British television .
She bats away any suggestion of a particular beauty or talent .
" [ Programme - makers ] know that I 'll be a good old team person , " is how she explains it .
" The fact that I 'd been a model in my early days , the fact that I can put my own face on and straighten my own hair back , drag out some crumpled bit of clothing and pretend it looks all right .
So I 'm all right as a team player , " she says .
" And I 'm interested in things , " she adds , " always interested in things . "
So , I ask , if anything should ever happen to David Attenborough , would she be prepared to fill his shoes ?
" Oh , " she says softly , " nobody could fill his shoes .
But he can have my shoes .
Even the shoes I made out of a bra " •

Death Trap Photography – Maite Josefa Horta
As a photographer , it ’s essential to work on unique projects to define your own portfolio .
You can put together set of pictures depicting a storyline , theme , or something that depicts an interest in your life to help your audience understand the way you see life through your camera .
Some photographers really know how to portray the feeling and style they are aiming for .
Maite Josefa Horta , also known as ‘ Lola ’ , is one of those who has put together a great series of photographs that are wonderfully unique and set her apart from the typical photographer .
The majority of my work reflects the darker side of womanhood , mostly dealing with the eras during the 50s - 60s .
Concentrating on what it is to become a woman and being lost through the process , I take mostly the things I ’ve learned about history and translate them into my form of art .

To Whom It May Concern :
My name is Nathan Bullock and you probably know that , either from the envelope or the news .
I was ( or possibly am ) 5 ’6 ’’ and weighed 190 pounds .
I have brown hair and brown eyes and my left arm is slightly longer than my right .
I wear a size 10 shoe and a large t- shirt .
I do not have a favorite food , but I ate pork chops last night and they were pretty good .
I am in the 11th grade .
If everything went as right as possible this is common knowledge , but if you ’re going to write the book about me you need a few more details than what the biopsy will show .
I was n’t trailer trash until someone told me I was .
Up until then I would n’t have even said I lived in a trailer , or in a trailer park .
I would have just said I lived at home .
I live with my mom and I am an only child because my dad got cancer and died .
My mom says his last words were that he loved me but I overheard my Uncle Terry say that he just said he was cold .
I do n’t know my mom very well but I think that is less because she works a lot and more just because she is my mom .
Sometimes I wonder if she dated anyone before my dad , or if she ever wanted to be a scientist or a lawyer when she was a kid , but there never seems to be a good time to bring it up .
My room is small and clean .
I have a window next to my bed and I can look at the sky when I lay down but it is usually cloudy .
Our house is near to a highway which is near to a hospital , so the sirens sometimes keep me awake .
Dead people were probably moving past my bed in those ambulances but it never really bothered me much .
People who were dead were just dead and did n’t really care about anything so I never really cared about them .
The ambulances sometimes blow their horns at the people driving on the road and I usually laugh at that .
I had a friend and her name was Janice .
She was never a dancer but would have liked to have been .
She found a VHS tape at a garage sale of people doing ballet and she was very sad when it broke .
From the highway to our park there was a small patch of dirt road before the pavement of the park would start and you could tell when she had walked on it .
Every ten or twelve steps she would point out her toe and do these little mock pirouettes , tracing half moons in the dirt .
I have seen her do it and when she does she lifts her arms slightly , pointing her hands at her hips but not touching them .
I slept with her once and it was not good .
I was not surprised when she was gone in the morning , but we talked afterwards and it was OK .
My school had all the grades from six to twelve so everyone was sort of angry all the time .
There was always something someone had done last year that the other person did n’t like , but they had to talk to them and be nice because there was no one else to talk to .
So people were only sort of angry most of the time .
I have never been in a fight but I have come close .
My favorite teacher was Mr. Andorelli .
He taught History and watched CNN on his lunch breaks in his classroom and sometimes I joined him .
Teachers did not like him but most students did because he would make fun of the kids who did n’t do good in his classes .
After school I would leave through the teacher parking lot because it was faster and one time I ran into Taylor Murray .
Mr. Andorelli would make fun of Taylor and Taylor would sulk and talk in class .
That day Taylor decided to drizzle Mr. Andorelli ’s car with yellow paint , and I saw this and I told him he should stop .
He asked me why and I said because Mr. Andorelli would n’t like it .
He looked like he was going to hit me and then he left .
After that I went to Mr. Andorelli ’s room and watched CNN with him .
We watched for a few minutes and I told him that his car was covered in paint .
He did n’t really react the way I thought he would .
He just ran his fingers through his hair and said yes , it probably was .
I think about that sometimes when the ambulances go by .
The only time I tried to have a conversation with my mother it was because my hand hurt .
I started waking up every now and again with my hand all clenched in a fist and I told her because it was uncomfortable in the morning .
My knuckles were sore .
My mother was usually getting home from work when I was awake .
She worked hard and never hid a bottle in her purse , but she did sometimes leave pills out in the open .
I told her about my fist and she said not to worry because it was just a hand .
I never really went to the parties .
People I knew went to because they were always saying they were going to be fun .
I was never really in need of fun .
I was fairly content with what was happening .
Janice told me to come to one , so I did but I left shortly after we got there .
There was alcohol soaking into the shag of the house it was at and kids were playing an old piano badly .
I told Janice goodbye and walked home in the middle of the street the whole way .
A car went around me and honked so I waved .
They are probably saying that this was all because Janice died but that is n’t totally true because she was just dead and it never really meant anything .
All the kids said Taylor put something in her drink and people were sort of angry but there was not really anything they could do but be angry .
The ambulance sound came up the dirt road this time .
I guess she had done it herself with her father ’s pistol , which I suppose was a good thing to do because her dad would have done it anyway on account of the baby .
Probably .
But everyone was really sad and they would ask me if I was sad and I usually said yes but sometimes I would just say nothing and they would pat me on the shoulder .
A priest told me she was in a better place now so I guess he liked wooden boxes .
I would have liked to have seen the ticker .
The words running across the bottom of the screen , usually with more facts about whatever news story was running , sometimes breaking weather alerts or celebrity sightings .
I asked Mr. Andorelli why they did this and he said it was because people love to be sad and angry at the news so the more news they put on screen the more people would watch their channel .
He said tragedy is a seller ’s market .
That made a lot of sense to me .
You will probably go with a well known journalist or writer , and I do n’t really know any but you should pick one that has done this sort of thing before because I want it to be good .
I have been mowing lawns since I was ten and I have all the money saved under my mattress because people would tell me I should save it but when I asked what I should spend it on they never really had an answer .
Some would say a car so I could drive my friends around but I only had one friend and she liked to go to parties and I did n’t so that never appealed to me .
So I went into town and retained a lawyer to cover my likeness rights .
I learned about them on the computers at my school .
I only paid him for a week , but made sure he got a portion of my estate as a retainer , so I assume he will still work for me .
His name is Jerry Klingmann and he is sixty - three years old and has no idea why anyone my age would need to have his likeness rights protected but he humored me and took my money and signed my papers .
I would guess he no longer will need his pension .
My dad had a gun so I will probably use it but I do n’t know what kind it is so you will have to find out .
I think it is a revolver .
It does n’t hold many rounds but each one is a charitable foundation waiting to happen .
I will probably shoot a few bullets into the roof so everyone hides .
I have been working on my aim so I wo n’t hit anybody I do n’t want to .
I hope they all duck under their desks and tables like they do on television because I could never help but laugh when I saw them do that .
I will shoot Taylor though because he probably deserves it , and maybe someone else but not so they are killed .
Somewhere non-lethal , like the fleshy part of the thigh .
They wo n’t deserve it but it will give them something to drink about , like Janice ’s dad who told us he had lots of whiskey because of a war he was in .
Taylor wo n’t really care because he will be dead , and I doubt I will care either , because he is just dead and not really anything to worry about .
Maybe I will shoot him in the chest and make him care for a little while .
Somebody will run their fingers over his eyelids and that will make me smile and they will notice .
They will write a poem about it and I ’ll get paid for that too ..
A few cracked eggs , they will say , and they will be right .
Maybe a round will stray and hit someone outside a window , someone walking their dog or taking out the garbage .
Two feet to the left , a minute later , they would have been fine they will say .
They ’ll talk grimly about how random things are .
After all that I will probably shoot myself , not because I want to but because it seems like the thing you are supposed to do , and you need an ending to write about .
In their darker moments people who threw the parties will probably spit and say I had my fun and they will probably be right .
I do n’t really care for the things but I have bought a few video games for you to choose from .
There are a few movies in the house , and I think there are a few with guns in it .
Books were never really my thing , but I have a few comics and tapes in my room .
I will probably add to them just to give you a nice selection .
One of these things probably set me off , so I will leave it to you to decide which .
I figure that you and your competitors will probably all write a book so I have sent this to them too so that way my mom wo n’t have to work again .
She works too much and I do n’t like that .
Janice sometimes said that being a dancer was probably hard work , so I hope I can bring myself to do this because being famous is probably just as hard , but that is only if you are famous and living .
Being famous and dead is just lucrative .
This way I can just skip to the finish .
Anyway , there is a mailbox outside my school , so I will drop this in there and hopefully it makes it to you .
If there was some way you could tell Mr. Andorelli that I was sorry I could n’t do anything about his car , that would be great .
I always wanted to tell him that .
I do n’t think I will care if you do n’t , but if you could , that would be OK .
Sincerely ,
Nathan Bullock .

The U.S. Army is about to start building a 500 megawatt solar thermal plant in the California desert .
When it 's done , the facility will be one of the largest renewable energy plants in the world .
Which is kind of ironic , since the Army does n’t pay all that much attention to climate change .
Turns out , sustainable energy is safer , said Dr. Kevin Geiss , the program director for the project .
The Army today introduced the private developers , Clark Enterprises and a Spanish company called Acciona , that will build this gargantuan solar plant at Ft. Irwin , California .
It 's one of the military 's primary locations to train for war .
Right now , like many military bases , most of its energy comes from diesel generators — with long , vulnerable lines back to the fuel source .
Screw the green movement , solar just makes sense .
In a bloggers ' conference call today , Geiss explained :
One way to look at this is to just take a step back and not use the word renewable or alternative or anything and say okay , if we were going to try to get power and energy for our installations and we wanted to make sure that we have consistent access , that it ’s affordable , that we would be at a low risk for disruption , that we would have decreased impact on the environment , I would say that our renewable and alternative energies would pop to the top of the list .
Ft. Irwin is prime location .
There are 14,000 acres of land on the base , most of it unused unoccupied .
Sites like this mean that the Army can push renewable energy development , said Geiss .
All over the country , the Army has huge patches of land next to bases with a constant energy demand .
And Ft. Irwin has some bonus features .
It ’s right next to high capacity transmission lines , which means that later , the army can sell most of the excess energy to southern California .
At peak , Ft. Irwin only needs 35 megawatts , leaving around 465 to shed .
But the Army also wants to distance Ft. Irwin from the grid if necessary , said Geiss .
Developers will need to build a mechanism for the base to be completely energy autonomous in an emergency situation .
That ’s one of the major differences between Ft. Irwin and the Army ’s active solar plant at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada .
Nellis produces around 14 megawatts and remains tethered to the grid .
The solar plant at Ft. Irwin will require at least1.5 billion dollars total , and should be ready to crank electrons by 2022 .
This will be a big break from the military past , said Geiss .
“ We have clear examples , at least in the past 100 years , where the lack of fuel has hindered military operations .
What held Patton back in Germany was that Eisenhower was turning the fuel over to Montgomery . ”
No longer .
Like it or not , camo is the new green .

ALSO :
The Defence Department has confirmed it is investigating claims Australian sailors engaged in a sex - for - money competition .
Channel Seven
News aired claims sailors from HMAS Success ran a contest to see who could sleep with the most female crew members .
Cash points were assigned and records were allegedly kept in a book known as ' The Ledger ' .
Dollar values were placed on each woman 's head , said the report .
The sailors reportedly dared one another to have sex in numerous locations , like the top of a pool table , and more money was on offer if a sailor could sleep with a female officer , or lesbian .
It is alleged the contest was discovered when the ship was in Singapore in May .
The captain ordered the sailors to immediately return home to Australia after they were formally interviewed .
A Defence Department spokesman would not confirm how many sailors were involved but says the men were removed from the ship and a formal inquiry is now underway .
" The matter concerning sailors who were returned to Australia from HMAS Success in May 2009 remains under investigation , so the veracity of any allegations has yet to be confirmed , " Defence said in a statement to the Seven Network .
" The individuals were removed from the ship after an equity and diversity health check , which led to a formal inquiry being initiated .
" During the equity and diversity health check a number of concerns were raised by female crew members .
These concerns are now subject to formal inquiry . "
The statement said the navy demands a working environment " free from unacceptable behaviour " .
It warns all of its staff to " treat others fairly " and that any form of unacceptable behaviour " will be dealt with " .

( CNN ) -- Space shuttle Discovery launched just before midnight Friday on a mission to the international space station .
Space shuttle Discovery lifts off late Friday from Kennedy Space Center in a photo from iReporter Alan Walters .
The crew of seven astronauts includes a Mexican - American and one from Sweden .
Another of those seven , Nicole Stott , will remain on the station as a flight engineer , while astronaut Timothy Kopra is to return home aboard the shuttle .
Also on board : The Leonardo logistics module , science experiments and the Combined Operational Load Bearing External Resistance Treadmill ( COLBERT ) , named for fake newsman Stephen Colbert of Comedy Central 's " The Colbert Report . "
Colbert won an online poll conducted by NASA to name the newest space station compartment , but Colbert and the space agency compromised to give the moniker to the treadmill .
The new compartment was given the name Tranquility .
NASA astronaut Cady Coleman said the treadmill is an essential addition to the space station .
Watch shuttle launch »
" We have the treadmill now to keep them healthy , which is really part of being able to come home in one piece .
So it is an essential part , " Coleman said .

Discovery 's liftoff , originally set for Tuesday , had been postponed three times -- first for bad weather , and twice more while mission managers checked out indications of a faulty valve .

If we knew such a scenario were going to happen in the new few years ( or next 20 or 30 years ) , how would it change the way we think ?
The chance that any one of us would live through such an event would be fairly low .
I am sure we could all think of negative impacts , but tonight we are going to try to look for the positive .
Could this be in any way liberating , or positive ?
Below the fold , I will give you a few of my ideas .
There are no doubt different ways this could happen .
My own concern is that systemic risk might affect the world 's financial system , credit system , and international trade system .
Globalization might rapidly wind down , and with it our ability to manufacture goods using materials from around the world .
Our ability to maintain technology would drop quickly , as it becomes impossible to manufacture essential items such as computers , tires , batteries , and replacement parts for vehicles .
The extraction and use of fossil fuels and uranium might also wind down quickly , eliminating most electricity and nearly all commercial food supplies .
World population in this scenario might drop to perhaps 10 % of its current level , in a matter of years .
Many Oil Drum readers imagine what is ahead as a slide down the net energy curve , as the amount of oil and natural gas available gradually decline .
Somehow , business as usual will continue , but at a lower level , as resources deplete .
But what if a better model for what is ahead is overshoot and collapse ?
Appreciation for what we have today
If we knew that what we have now would soon be gone , perhaps we could better appreciate what we have today .
We might be more concerned about family and friends and what is truly important , instead of worrying about amassing more wealth .
I suggest reading the post Life After the Crash : Lessons from Kenya , if you have n't done so .
Derek -- the guest author -- writes ,
It 's the mindset that makes most Kenyans experience a happiness most Westerners would never consider to be possible given realities - as they see and experience them .
In Kenya , we do use electricity ( hydro / diesel ) , if we can .
We have constant power cuts .
But that 's not the only limit .
In fact , the vast majority of us , even the so - called middle - class , build our lives around limits .
Limits are the basis for every decision we make , business or otherwise .
It is , you could say , a way of life that is happy when it is not done in - not unhappy if things go wrong ( I am not sure that this makes sense ) .
People there - including me - celebrate every day that was a good day .
And a good day is one where we got by .
I would say , for 95 % of Kenyans , life there is very much focused on the hour - and hardly ever on the future .
According to Derek , people can be very happy just celebrating each day , and not worrying too much about the future .
Even if we knew ( or suspected ) there was likely to be a crash ahead , we could be happy with what we had each day .
There is no real reason to worry about possible future calamities .
We can only live one day at a time , anyhow , and we are pretty limited as to what we can do to change things .
Less pressure to get ahead
If we knew our situation prior to the crash was only temporary , we might be freer to enjoy what we have today , and not worry whether it will lead to some supposed better step in the future , since likely no one will be getting much ahead .
If it is good enough for now , than it is good enough .
Of course , if we feel that it is terribly important that we be one of the 10 % ( or whatever ) who will ultimately remain after the collapse , then there is huge pressure on taking the steps necessary to make this happen .
But if we know ( or strongly suspect ) that a collapse is coming , we can at least take steps that are likely to be appropriate for a crash , such as moving to a farming community .
Less pressure to pay off debt
If we strongly suspect that we are headed for a crisis in which everyone else has trouble paying off their debt , perhaps paying of debt is not as important .
This is admittedly a guess .
But what will a government or bank do with thousands of unoccupied homes ?
Lots of cars that people cannot pay for and cannot drive for lack of gasoline ?
Reduction in worries about later life
Many things done today are done out of concern for later life .
We save money for retirement .
We invest our money with the hope it will grow before retirement .
If we strongly suspect that we are not likely to live until normal retirement age ( or if we do , our financial system wo n't be around anyhow ) , the point in saving for retirement becomes much less .
If we do survive the crash but the financial system does n't , saving for retirement may still not be much of an issue .
In a poorer world , most people will work as long as they are able , making retirement a thing of the past .
In fact , it we have already saved , and we suspected a major crash scenario were coming , the knowledge might free us to use what funds we had saved for things that we value now .
We could even donate funds to charities we consider worthwhile .
Besides monetary worries regarding old age , many of us have other concerns .
Will I be well ?
Will my spouse pass away first , and I be left by myself ?
Will I be able to drive ?
Will I be able to take care of my adult disabled child ?
If you really are likely not going to live very long anyhow ( and neither is your adult disabled child ) , these issues may become less important .
Are We in Charge , or is Mother Nature ?
Right now , some of use feel like we have an obligation to help Mother Nature out on environmental issues .
If Mother Nature really is in charge , as in this scenario , things may get fixed pretty quickly , even without our assistance .
Fossil fuel burning is likely to drop quickly ; acid rain is likely to stop ; overfishing of oceans will likely drop quickly ; and industrial agriculture will likely come to an end .
A lot of environmental challenges will be repaired as quickly as Mother Nature can arrange it .
Our anxiousness may not really be necessary .
Things may straighten themselves out , even without our assistance .
Conclusion
I think the idea of a terrible crash ( even if it takes place over 20 or 30 years ) has at some point gone through all of our heads .
The idea is pretty awful , but maybe it is something we should at least be thinking through .
There might even be a few bright spots .
If you have some ideas , perhaps you can share them with the rest of us .

This , my first Monthly Musing that I 've actually gotten around to finishing ( it 's still August , garsh darnit ! ) , will take the theme in a slightly different direction .
In this case , I 'll be writing about a trait of mine that is technically a good strategy ; a skill that should make games easier and lead to success .
This seems to go against what this month 's theme is about , but let me explain .
This gaming trait is one that , combined with my personality and my earlier gaming experience , ends up making some games feel more frustrating , difficult or simply less fun .
So , even if I do n't necessarily " suck " at the game , I end up failing in what is the more important goal of playing a game : having fun .
So , what was that preamble referring to ?
As my title states , I 'm an item hoarder ( I was going to put in a pun in the title about being item " whore - der " , but it did n't seem to be too funny ) .
Most modern games have a large variety of items to collect , store and use .
Ammunition , energy , medkits , potions , shields , power - ups , superweapons ... the possibilities are endless .
These items are supposed to be used whenever the player is in a difficult situation when the added power or protection will help him or her win the day .
The problem is that I have the dual tendencies of wanting to collect as many items as I can , but being reluctant to use them .
First , I often go out my way to purchase or find one - time use items , to ensure that I have a plentiful supply for a long dungeon / boss fight .
However , when I actually get to the difficult area , I end up thinking " I can't use that powerup now for this fight , there might be an even harder one later where I 'll really need it . "
One can see how this train of thought can continue for the entire game , so often I end up never finding enough need to make use of them .
Of course , usually I 'm able to prevail with my self - imposed handicap , but this is n't at all what the developers intended when they put in items .
... er ... " well prepared . "
As you can figure , the genre where my " problem " causes the most grief is in RPG's .
Of course , there are the usual curative items , which I can sometimes tolerate using ( although I prefer to make the longer trek to inn or other recuperative point instead ) .
Then there are the " buffs " : items that give a temporary boost ( usually a single battle ) to a character 's skills , like attack , defense , magic , etc .
Iuse these items because their effects seem negligible enough to not berequired for any battle .
I get more enjoyment out of hoarding them , with satisfaction coming from knowing I have a plentiful supply ready for an emergency , even though I 'll never consider any situation to be dangerous enough to use them .
A rarer , though even more frustrating , type of item in RPG's is the limited - use item : one that can be used more than once , but has a known or hidden limit that will eventually lead to the item breaking either permanently , or requiring repair .
For me , the worst offender would be theseries .
Most ( if not all ) the weapons in the game have a finite number of uses before breaking , making every single combat action seem like a torturous waste of a precious resource .
Since common weapons usually last longer than rare ones , it leads me to mostly use the former , for the sake of saving those special weapons for , you guessed it , " an emergency " .
Of course , I do know that most weapons can be repaired in the game , but what if my special weapon broke in the middle of a boss battle ?
Better to keep it at full strength , safely tucked away in storage , to await that desperate struggle that will never happen .
So , as you can see , my item hoarding does n't make me suck at RPG's .
It 's more like I add a layer of frustration to the games , both from my over - worrying about collecting and saving items and the increased difficulty that comes from refraining from using them when I really should be .
Now , how did my , er , mental problem come about ?
Time for a bit of self - psychoanalysis .
Right now , I 've been cleaning out my room at my parents ' house in preparation for moving into university residence thousands of miles away .
Having lived at home for over twenty years , naturally I 've accumulated a lot of possessions .
But in going through the various drawers , shelves and boxes in my room , I noticed that I 've also collected a lot of pointless items ( actually , let 's just say junk ) that I only kept because Ineed them , want to look at them again , or just simply never could bring myself to throw them away .
For example , I had kept Grade 9 math notes when I 'm about to start a Masters ' degree in History !
I had trinket souvenirs , childrens ' toys .
airline ticket stubs , clothes that had n't fit me in years , and all kinds of obsolete technology like blank VHS tapes and floppy disks .
I finally was able to bite the bullet and get rid of a lot of this junk .
My personal hoarding was n't extreme , since my room was n't crammed floor to ceiling with stuff , but it does show that my real - life tendency toward keeping items without using / getting rid of them drifted into video games .
However , like most addictions , there is some sort of enabler .
A " gateway drug " , as some anti-drug advocates use to refer to marijuana .
So , I looked back on my early childhood experience at gaming , which was in the late NES and early SNES era .
For most early games , such as the originalthe only items that were usually stored were extra lives , and it was totally rational to collect as many as possible but not want to have to use them .
So the training already began that hoarding was a positive goal .
Later , in , one could actually keep an inventory of powerups like mushrooms , fire flowers and stars to be used whenever the player felt like it .
Like I mentioned before , for common items I could usually bring myself to use them once in a while .
However , there were other powerups that were considerably rarer .
Yes , I 'm talking about the Tanooki Suit and the Hammer Bros.
Suit .
These items come into your possession only a handful of times in the game , if you 're lucky .
They 're also incredibly cool looking and powerful .
So , the problem arose of when would be the best time to make use of them .
If you get hit just once while using them , fall in a pit or accidentally grab a different powerup , they 're gone .
Forever .
You 'll never get another chance to taste the deliciousness that is Mario throwing hammers at enemies or becoming a statue that has the power to kill formerly unbeatable enemies like Thwomps .
At least , that 's how it felt like to the younger me as I was playing the game .
So , it led me to hold them tight against Mario 's digital chest , waiting for that nonexistent crisis .
Even on the final level against Bowser , I would refuse to use them , because my hoarding logic argued that " Oh , I 'll try to beat Bowser normally for this life .
Maybe if I die enough times , I 'llneed to pull out one of my trump cards . "
So , it was these powerups that started me off on my terrible path of hoarding items in games .
Goddamn Hammer Bros. Suit .
Looking at the past and the present , in real life and in games , I have been an item hoarder .
In most cases , it has n't caused me tremendous difficulty , but has caused me to play games in , let us say , a more " sucky " way .
I know that the items were put there by developers to be used to make the game experience easier or more enjoyable .
I am also completely aware that by hoarding items I am ignoring this fact .
Still , despite all that , I still feel that I get a ... perverse ... enjoyment out of collecting items and not using them .
I do n't totally understandI enjoy hoarding , but in the end , as long as I 'm having fun , even if it was n't intended by games , I do n't actually suck at them .
I might be a hoarder , but at least I 'm ... er ... well prepared .
Waxman - Markey Cap and Trade Will Pay For Itself , CBO Finds
September 10th , 2009 by Susan Kraemer
The Waxman - Markey Climate Bill uses Cap and Trade to get our current 6 billion tons of CO2 a year down to just over 5 billion tons a year by 2020 ( 20 % by 2020 ) and continuing down further by 2050 .
The Congressional Budget Office has estimated that the auction proceeds of the current Cap and Trade bill would increase Federal revenues by about $ 846 billion by 2019 .
That would more than fund the $ 821 billion in renewable energy spending that it will take ( per the CBO ) to reduce the national carbon footprint by almost a billion tons a year on deadline , and would leave $ 25 billion in the bank for additional renewable energy projects .
This revenue would fund programs that reduce carbon emissions and that cut the cost to individuals and businesses .
Some examples over the jump :
Provide energy tax credits or energy rebates to small business and low and middle income families to offset the impact of higher energy - related prices .
Require utilities to buy an increasing percentage of energy from renewable power and provide assistance like loan guarantees for clean energy projects .
Fund research and development of technologies related to carbon capture and sequestration .
Fund $ 25 billion in DOE loans to automobile manufacturers and component suppliers under the current Advanced Technology Vehicle Manufacturing Loan Program .
Establish a Clean Energy Deployment Administration ( CEDA ) within the Department of Energy ( DOE ) , which would be authorized to provide direct loans , loan guarantees , and letters of credit for clean energy projects .
Authorize the Department of Transportation to provide individuals with vouchers to acquire new vehicles that achieve greater fuel efficiency than the existing qualifying vehicles owned by the individuals .
Authorize appropriations for various programs under EPA , DOE , and other agencies .
According to the Congressional Budget Office , Waxman - Markey would cover about 72 % of US emissions initially and by 2020 that would be up to 86 percent .
The initial auction reserve price for carbon would be $ 10 a ton ; stepping up to $ 15 by 2020 ( and on up to $ 64 a ton by 2050 . )
Cap and trade offers maximum flexibility , clear and feasible goals , and a predictable time - line :

Quotations
The man convicted of the Lockerbie bombing has released a dossier of legal papers which he claims are proof he was wrongly convicted of the worst terrorist attack on British soil .
The documents , published online today by Abdel Basset al - Megrahi , show that serious doubts about the reliability of the key witness at his trial were raised independently by Scotland 's official body , which investigates suspected miscarriages of justice .
The dossier demonstrates that the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission ( SCCRC ) sent Megrahi 's case back to the court of appeal in 2007 , after deciding that the judges who convicted him had made a series of errors about the evidence of a Maltese shopkeeper , Tony Gauci – the only witness to link the Libyan to the alleged plot .
According to the commission , those mistakes were significant enough to raise substantial doubts about the safety of Megrahi 's conviction of killing 270 people in the Lockerbie bombing on 21 December 1988 .
The crucial mistake , the SCCRC said , was believing prosecution claims that Megrahi had bought clothes at Gauci 's shop on 7 December 1988 , allegedly used later in the suitcase bomb .
This evidence was " unreasonable " , the SCCRC said , and was alone grounds for belief that Megrahi was wrongly convicted .
The commission said that evidence available at the trial , including the weather and the time Christmas lights were switched on near Gauci 's shop , suggested that the clothes were actually bought on 23 November 1988 – when Megrahi was not in Malta .
The 298 - page dossier , published on a website specially set up for the purpose , is the convicted bomber 's attempt to prove his innocence after his controversial release from Greenock prison on compassionate grounds last month .
Megrahi is in the terminal stages of prostate cancer , and Scottish ministers believe he has less than three months to live .
The papers were used for the first two stages of his appeal earlier this year , but Megrahi abandoned the appeal two days before he was freed and before the appeal court could give its judgement on the first grounds for appeal .
When Megrahi confirmed the case was being dropped his lawyers told the appeal court that he believed this would speed up his release , fuelling claims – later denied by Megrahi – that a deal was struck to prevent embarrassing evidence about his conviction emerging in court .
In a statement released today by his solicitors , Megrahi said : " I have returned to Tripoli with my unjust conviction still in place .
As a result of the abandonment of my appeal I have been deprived of the opportunity to clear my name through the formal appeal process .
I have vowed to continue my attempts to clear my name .
" I will do everything in my power to persuade the public , and in particular the Scottish public , of my innocence . "
In a reference to the many US relatives and senior figures in the US government who were furious at his release , including the secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , he said he hoped the papers would " assist in the understanding of my case , especially for those who have been most profoundly affected by it " .
According to the dossier , the commission believed that the three judges who jailed Megrahi after an unprecedented trial in Holland in January 2001 had unreasonably dismissed a number of contradictions and ambiguities in Gauci 's interviews with police and in court .
Megrahi's lawyers said Gauci was interviewed 23 times by Scottish police , and an undisclosed number of times by FBI and CIA investigators .
He first appeared to identify Megrahi 27 months after the date of purchase of the clothes , while it took 12 years for the trial to take place .
His lawyers are expected to allege next week that Gauci received a $ 2 m reward after Megrahi 's conviction .
The SCCRC said that Gauci 's interviews and his evidence in court showed that he : was unable to identify the date the clothes were bought , and frequently said it may have been November or December ; was confused about the date the Christmas lights went up ; repeatedly told police he could not remember the exact time or day .
The commission concluded that the judges reached an unreasonable verdict based on unreliable evidence , Megrahi 's appeal papers state .
Megrahi's lawyers added that the verdict " consists of defective reasoning or self - misdirection in a number of respects " .
His documents also reveal detailed challenges to key aspects of the bomb plot as described by prosecutors .
There was no proof that the suitcase was put on board a feeder flight at Luqa airport in Malta which went to Frankfurt airport on 21 December .
There was also no evidence to prove that Megrahi had been involved in the plot , and the dossier claims that the judges had unfairly rejected defence evidence at the trial that pointed towards a different culprit : the Iranian - funded Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine - General Command .
More than 50 companies , academic institutions , and other organizations , including vendors such as Red Hat and Oracle , are banding together to promote use of open source by the federal government via an organization called Open Source for America .
Officially unveiled on Wednesday at the O'Reilly Open Source Convention ( OSCON ) in San Jose , Calif. , the organization is intended to capitalize on federal efforts to be more transparent and collaborative , organization members said .
The federal government already has been using open source software , they recognized , but the new organization wants to further that cause .

" This organization came about as a result of a number of companies and academic institutions and organizations that believe that there was a void in Washington in terms of having sort of a unified voice for open source , " Rabon said .
Immediate goals include educating federal decisions makers about and encouraging government agencies to give equal priority to open source software .
Initially , the organization will have no employees ; its affairs will be handled by a steering committee of organization members .
Over time , there may a staff in Washington .
" We 're mainly trying to create awareness right now , " Rabon said .
The IT industry has been prone to forming industry - wide organizations for different causes , some with a degree of redundancy .
But there has been none specifically for educating the federal government on open source , said Jim Zemlin , executive director of the Linux Foundation , which also is participating in Open Source for America .
Among the missing from Open Source for America is Microsoft .
But the company was not asked to participate , Zemlin said .
There currently are no membership fees for Open Source for America , but there may be over time , Rabon said .
Other participants in Open Source for America include Google , Mozilla , Software Freedom Law Center , Alfresco , Advanced Micro Devices , Democracy in Action , Electronic Frontier Foundation , Jaspersoft , Ingres , and Open Source Initiative .
Open Source for America was slated to have a Web site at opensourceforamerica.org .
Did you preorder the Ghostbusters video game ?
Did you go to a certain video game retail chain to do so ?
If you answered yes to both questions , you may have received a call from none other than Dan Aykroyd to remind you to pick up the game .
Oh , and trade in some old stuff , for the love of Gozer !
Here 's what the message says :
Greetings fellow paranormal enthusiasts .
This is Dan Aykroyd , speaking to you through the miracle of 16 - bit voice recording to remind you that your copy of Ghostbusters will be at your local GameStop by tomorrow .
Do n't forget to bring in your used games because you 'll receive an extra 30 percent credit for games you trade toward Ghostbusters .
Thank you , and see you on the other side .
That 's actually pretty cool , although I never thought I 'd live to see a world where a Ghostbusters game — that is actually good ! — will be released when I 'm nearing 30 and a star of the film would be shilling for GameStop .
It 's a wonderful life .
Thanks to Destructoid for the heads - up .
Tighter restrictions on mountaintop removal mining are simply not enough .
Instead , the Obama administration must prohibit this destructive practice , which is devastating vast stretches of Appalachia .
By James Hansen of Yale Environment 360 , part of Guardian Environment Network
President Obama speaks of " a planet in peril . "
The president and the brilliant people he appointed in energy and science know that we must move rapidly to carbon - free energy to avoid handing our children a planet that has passed climate tipping points .
The science is clear .
Burning all fossil fuels will destroy the future of young people and the unborn .
And the fossil fuel that we must stop burning is coal .
Coal is the critical issue .
Coal is the main cause of climate change .
It is also the dirtiest fossil fuel — air pollution , arsenic , and mercury from coal have devastating effects on human health and cause birth defects .
Recently , the administration unveiled its new position on mountaintop coal mining and set out a number of new restrictions on the practice in six Appalachian states .
These new rules will require tougher environmental review before blowing up mountains .
But it 's a minimal step .
The Obama administration is being forced into a political compromise .
It has sacrificed a strong position on mountaintop removal in order to ensure the support of coal - state legislators for a climate bill .
The political pressures are very real .
But this is an approach to coal that defeats the purpose of the administration 's larger efforts to fight climate change , a sad political bargain that will never get us the change we need on mountaintop removal , coal or the climate .
Coal is the linchpin in mitigating global warming , and it 's senseless to allow cheap mountaintop - removal coal while the administration is simultaneously seeking policies to boost renewable energy .
Mountaintop removal , which provides a mere 7 percent of the nation 's coal , is done by clear - cutting forests , blowing the tops off of mountains , and then dumping the debris into streambeds — an undeniably catastrophic way of mining .
This technique has buried more than 800 miles of Appalachian streams in mining debris and by 2012 will have serious damaged or destroyed an area larger than Delaware .
Mountaintop removal also poisons water supplies and pollutes the air with coal and rock dust .
Coal ash piles are so toxic and unstable that the Department of Homeland Security has declared that the location of the nation 's 44 most hazardous coal ash sites must be kept secret .
They fear terrorists will find ways to spill the toxic substances .
But storms and heavy rain can do the same .
A recent collapse in Tennessee released 100 times more hazardous material than the Exxon - Valdez oil spill .
If the Obama administration is unwilling or unable to stop the massive environmental destruction of historic mountain ranges and essential drinking water for a relatively tiny amount of coal , can we honestly believe they will be able to phase out coal emissions at the level necessary to stop climate change ?
The issue of mountaintop removal is so important that I and others concerned about this problem will engage in an act of civil disobedience on June 23 at a mountaintop removal site in Coal River Valley , West Virginia .
[ Editor 's note : Hansen and 30 other protesters were arrested at the June 23 protest and charged with impeding traffic outside a Massey Energy coal site in Raleigh County , West Virginia . ]
Experts agree that energy efficiency and carbon - free energies can satisfy our energy needs .
Coal left in the ground is useful .
It holds up the mountains , which , left intact , are an ideal site for wind energy .
In contrast , mountaintop removal and strip mining of coal is a shameful abomination .
Mining jobs have shrunk to a small fraction of past levels .
With clean energy , there could be far more , green - energy jobs , and the government could support the retraining of miners , to a brighter , cleaner future .
Politicians may have to make concessions on what is right for what is winnable .
But as a scientist and a citizen , I believe the right course is very clear :
The climate crisis demands a moratorium on new coal - fired power plants that do not capture and safely dispose of all emissions .
And mountaintop removal , providing only a small fraction of our energy , should be permanently prohibited .
President Obama remains the best hope , perhaps the only hope , for real change .
If the president uses his influence , his eloquence , and his bully pulpit , he could be the agent of real change .
But he does need our help to overcome the political realities of compromise .
We must make clear to Congress , to the EPA , and to the Obama administration that we the people want mountaintop removal abolished and we want a move toward a rapid phase - out of coal emissions now .
The time for half measures and caving in to polluting industries is over .
It is time for citizens to demand — yes , we can .

That last post took hours to put together , so this one will be short and brief .
A long time ago I found two settings for vim that , when used in conjunction , give me the word wrapping I need when I compose these posts from within Charm .
I never made a note of them , which is bad form .
The problem is something I ’ve talked about before , so I ’ll spare you the long and boring reason for needing that behavior .
Under Crux , the plain - jane vim that gets built does n’t word - wrap ; instead , words are simply broken at the end of the line .
Nothing wrong with that , but with
set formatoptions=l
set lbr
in my .vimrc , words break at spaces or hyphens , and links break at slashes or hyphens .
It ’s a very nice adjustment , particularly if you want vim to behave a little more like a word processor , and not so much like a text editor .
Not that there ’s anything wrong with that . 🙂
As Americans continue trying to understand how the government failed to stop the 9/11 hijack conspiracy , important clues can be garnered from examining the first World Trade Center bombing in February 1993 .
This bombing  the most economically destructive terrorist attack ever to occur in the United States up to that time  was partly the result of mind - numbing federal incompetence .
On November 5 , 1990 , Rabbi Meir Kahane was giving an anti-Arab speech at a New York hotel .
Kahane , founder of the radical Jewish Defense League ( JDL ) , vigorously advocated forcible expulsion of all Arabs from Israel and the occupied territories .
Israels parliament , the Knesset , banned Kahanes political party for inciting racism and endangering security . 
At the end of his speech on that November 1990 night , El Sayyid Nosair , a 36 - year - old Egyptian immigrant , walked up to Kahane , pulled out a .357 , and fatally shot him in the neck .
Nosair was part of a cabal of Muslims filled with intense hatred toward Israel and the Egyptian government of Hosni Mubarak .
When police searched his residence , they carried off 47 boxes of documents , paramilitary manuals , maps , and diagrams of buildings ( including the World Trade Center ) .
But , as a 2002 congressional report on federal failures before 9/11 noted in September 2002 ,
The NYPD and the District Attorneys office resisted attempts to label the Kahane assassination a conspiracy  despite the apparent links to a broader network of radicals .
Instead , these organizations reportedly wanted the appearance of speedy justice and a quick resolution to a volatile situation .
By arresting Nosair , they felt they had accomplished both .
The trial of lone gunman Nosair , beginning in late 1991 , was marked by rioting outside the courthouse , death threats against the judge and lawyers , calls for blood revenge against the defendant and cries of  Death to Jews !  from his Moslem supporters .
A small band of Muslims paced the sidewalks each day in front of the court , denouncing Israel , the United States , and the supposed persecution of Nosair .
As a July 4 , 1993 , Los Angeles Times article , headlined  N.Y .
Trial in Rabbis Death Planted an Explosive Seed observed ,
Out of those loud demonstrations of contempt for the U.S. judicial system would emerge what authorities now say was a clandestine cell of terrorists who conspired to set off the World Trade Center bomb blast , plotted an unparalleled wave of attacks on U.S. landmarks and political figures and shattered Americas image of invulnerability to terrorism .
The FBI placed an informant named Emad Salem , a 43 - year - old former Egyptian military officer , in the midst of the Muslim protesters .
Salem insinuated himself and became the bodyguard for Sheik Abdul Rahman , a radical Muslim cleric .
The sheik had been heavily subsidized by the U.S. government while in Pakistan in the late 1980s helping to inspire Muslims to fight the Soviets in Afghanistan .
Though the evidence that Nosair killed Kahane was stark , the jury found him not guilty on the murder charge but guilty of a firearms charge  that is , possessing the murder weapon .
After the trial , Salem continued his work as an FBI informant , receiving $ 500 a week , plus expenses .
Shortly after Nosair was convicted , Salem began meeting regularly with other members of the group of hard - line Muslims who coalesced during the Kahane trial .
In mid 1992 , Salem repeatedly warned the FBI that the Muslim group was planning to carry off a catastrophic bombing in New York City .
FBI supervisors were convinced he was concocting tall tales and fired him .
The first World Trade Center bombing
On February 26 , 1993 , a 1,200 - pound bomb in a van exploded in the parking garage beneath the World Trade Center .
This was the most destructive terrorist attack carried out on U.S. soil up to that time , killing six people , injuring more than a thousand , and causing half a billion dollars in damage .
If the van had been parked a few feet closer to one of the pillars , it could have collapsed an entire tower of the Trade Center , killing tens of thousands .
The case was quickly cracked when Mohammad Salameh , one of the bombers , repeatedly went to the Ryder rental office in Jersey City and demanded that Ryder refund his $ 400 deposit for the van , which he claimed had been stolen .
Law - enforcement agents had already determined from fragments at the World Trade Center that the van was the bomb delivery device .
After Salameh was arrested , the FBI quickly snared other plotters .
Time noted that the FBI looked supremely capable in speedily rounding up suspects in the World Trade Center bombing .
Assistant U.S. Attorney Andrew McCarthy later bragged to a New York jury that the first World Trade Center attack was one of the FBI s finest hours :
 To the rest of the world out there , the explosion in all its tragedy was actually a high - water mark for the FBI . 
Shortly after the bombing , the New York Times reported that FBI agents had been monitoring two mosques in the New York City area , as well as Sheik Omar Abdul Rahman , though
federal guidelines had limited their ability to tail them or conduct other close surveillance .
Nothing suggesting the purchase of explosives or the assembling of a bomb was detected , the officials said .
Even close surveillance might not have picked up a surreptitious act , they said .
A few months after the attack , FBI director William Sessions declared ,
Based on what was known to us at the time , we have no reason to believe we could have prevented the bombing of the World Trade Center .
The FBI initially appeared to have a strong case , buttressed largely by evidence provided by informant Emad Salem .
In July 1993 , the media learned that Salem had been inside the conspiracy a year before the attack .
Secret tape recordings
After the bombing , the FBI quickly rehired Salem and promised to pay him a million dollars to develop evidence of additional terrorist plots .
Because Salem did not trust the government to pay up , he secretly recorded his conversations with FBI agents .
In August , as the case was heading for trial , news leaked that Salem had made tapes of more than a hundred hours of his conversations with FBI agents and handlers .
The tape transcripts were not helpful to the prosecution .
In a call to an FBI agent shortly after the bombing , Salem complained ,
We was start already building the bomb , which is went off in the World Trade Center .
It was built , uh , uh , uh , supervising , supervision from the Bureau [ FBI ] and the DA [ district attorney ] and we was all informed about it .
And we know that the bomb start to be built .
By who ?
By your confidential informant .
What a wonderful great case .
And then he [ the FBI supervisor ] put his head in the sand and said , oh no , no , no that s not true , he is a son of a bitch , okay .
After the bombing , Salem anguished to one FBI agent ,  You were informed .
Everything is ready .
The day and the time .
Boom .
Lock them up and thats that .
That s why I feel so bad .
On another tape , Salem asked an FBI agent ,  Do you deny your supervisor is the main reason of bombing the World Trade Center ? 
The agent did not deny Salems charge .
Shortly after the bombing FBI agent Nancy Floyd confided to Salem that her supervisors had botched the case :
I felt that the people on the squad , that they didnt have a clue of how to operate things .
That the supervisors didnt know what was going on .
That they hadnt taken the time to learn the history .
It was never clear to what extent Salem instigated the bombing , as opposed to simply reporting on the plot to his FBI controllers .
Before the bombing , he offered to do a switcheroo on the bombers , substituting a harmless powder for the deadly explosives and thereby preventing any potential catastrophe .
The FBI spurned his offer .
The New York Times October 28 , 1993 , article with this revelation was headlined ,  Tapes Depict Proposal to Thwart Bomb Used in Trade Center Blast . 
Salem complained to one FBI agent that an FBI supervisor requested to make me to testify [ in public ] and if he didnt push for that , well be going building the bomb with a phony powder and grabbing the people who was involved in it .
But … we didnt do that .
The FBI was also embarrassed by the contents of the 47 boxes it had seized from Nosair and left in storage for more than two years .
The boxes were ignored in part because no one at the New York FBI office spoke or read Arabic .
One note discovered in the boxes declared ,  We had to thoroughly demoralize the enemies of God .
This is to be done by means of destroying and blowing up the towers that constitute the pillars of their civilization , such as the tourist attractions they re so proud of and the high buildings they re so proud of .
One law enforcement official told the Los Angeles Times in 1993 that the material described major conspiracies and provided a road map to the bombing of the World Trade Center and the subsequent plot . 
The FBI received far more credit for solving the first World Trade Center bombing than it received blame for the fact that its informant may have helped cause the bombing .
In the wake of the FBI s debacle , there were no oversight hearings or investigations by Congress to find out where the feds went wrong .
Instead , the FBI was riding high on the laurels of its new director , Louis Freeh , and was still collecting praise on Capitol Hill for its decisive solution to the Branch Davidian problem at Waco .
Despite the fact that Muslim terrorists came within a few feet of killing thousands of Americans , federal agencies subsequently failed to take seriously the risk of more such attacks .
The 2002 congressional report into pre-9/11 failures observed ,
The first attack on the World Trade Center was an unambiguous indication that a new form of terrorism  motivated by religious fanaticism and seeking mass casualties  was emerging and focused on America … .
However , the strategic implications of this shift in lethality do not appear to have been fully recognized .
Because the FBI was not held responsible for its failures in the first World Trade Center bombing , the agencys incompetence actually mushroomed in the following years .
As a result , the Bureau was inept at analyzing and pursuing terrorist threats at home .
But at least the FBI got plenty of budget increases and new agents in the years between the first and second World Trade Center bombings .

El robo de energía eléctrica en el centro del país no cede , lo que representa pérdidas anuales por 16 mil millones de pesos para Luz y Fuerza del Centro
[ email protected ]
El robo de energía eléctrica en el centro del país no cede , lo que representa pérdidas anuales por 16 mil millones de pesos para Luz y Fuerza del Centro ( LyFC ) .
De funcionar las medidas que se adopten , habría una leve mejoría dentro de tres años cuando las pérdidas disminuirían a 14 mil millones de pesos al año , reconocen LyFC , la Secretaría de Energía y el Sindicato Mexicano de Electricistas ( SME ) .
A pesar de que el gobierno federal condicionó la entrega de recursos a una baja en el robo de electricidad , la paraestatal y el sindicato informaron : “ El año pasado no hubo condiciones para ejecutar las acciones previstas para la reducción de pérdidas ” .
La empresa argumentó que “ no dispuso de los recursos suficientes para la adquisición de los materiales necesarios ” ; sin embargo , el 31 de julio del año pasado recibió autorización para un incremento presupuestal por 184 millones de pesos , que estaban etiquetados para ese fin .
De acuerdo con el Informe de Avance de los Indicadores de Desempeño 2009 , correspondiente al primer semestre , “ será en lo que resta del año cuando se pueda eliminar el retraso que presenta el Programa de Reducción de Pérdidas No Técnicas , a fin de cumplir con las metas establecidas ” .
Las pérdidas se originan principalmente por conexiones ilícitas , pero en 2008 se registraron alrededor de 140 mil servicios con “ consumo cero ” por lecturas mal intencionada o erróneas de medidores , así como 38 mil servicios que se encontraban suspendidos pero fueron autoconectados , lo cual agrava la situación .
As disorganized as the atheist movement is , we have been making slow , steady progress in some areas .
As much time as we waste duplicating each others ' efforts and retreading the same ground , it is hard to deny that atheism is experiencing something of a renaissance today .
If nothing else , we are seeing increasing numbers of atheists making the decision to no longer conceal their atheism .
As happy as I am to see this , I can't help wondering what more we could accomplish with even small improvements in organization .
We have not even come close to realizing our vast potential .
I have written quite a bit about the benefits of increased organization community building , and the like .
I 'm not going to repeat that here .
Instead , I just want to throw out something that I think should serve as a model of precisely the sort of organization I think we could accomplish .
Best of all , I think this model has the crucial advantage of being perfectly suited for overcoming much of the resistance many atheists have to organizing .
That model is MoveOn.org .
I encourage you to spend a few minutes looking around the MoveOn.org website .
Forget about their politics if you need to , and just notice the layout , capabilities , etc.MoveOn.org has signed up over 5 million members .
Think about what that means .
They have contact information ( at least e-mail addresses ) for 5 million people .
That means 5 million voters , 5 million potential donors , and 5 million potential activists which can be mobilized .
MoveOn.org regularly polls their supporters and actually modifies their agenda to reflect what the majority of their supporters want .
This is how grassroots is supposed to work .
Imagine being part of an organization which not only listens to its members but tailors its agenda to represent them .
What a welcome departure from how such groups usually seem to work .
Now that you 've looked around their website , can you really tell me that we could n't do that for the atheist movement ?
I may not personally have the technical expertise to design a slick website like that , but I am fairly confident that many of you could do so .
What else would be needed ?
A web domain and host , a board of directors , a little money to get up and running , publicity , non -profit status perhaps ?
I 'm sure it is n't quite as simple as I 'm making it sound , but I cannot believe that we in the atheist community could n't pull it off .
Just imagine the next time some jackass pundit or politician engages in anti-atheist bigotry .
Action alerts go out to members via email , petitions are circulated , letters are written , calls are made , press releases go out to news agencies .
And instead of every damn blogger , forum host , Twitter user , etc. having to do it themselves without necessarily knowing what others are doing , it is done from this sort of organization .
Imagine the clout of a Pharyngula multiplied several times over !
That is what we 're talking about here .
I refuse to believe that this is beyond our means .
Together , we could do this .
The only question is why we are n't doing it .
Thousands had marched to the football stadium in downtown Conakry on Monday to protest against Guinea 's military junta .
Nearly 160 people paid for that show of dissent with their lives , it emerged yesterday , some gunned down in a hail of bullets , other skewered by bayonets as they tried to flee or rescue the women being raped by soldiers in the stands .
As the full scale of the massacre became known , condemnation poured in from around the world .
France , the country 's former colonial ruler , suspended military aid and the African Union threatened sanctions .
The French also called an emergency EU meeting for today to discuss punishing those individuals behind the " savage and bloody " repression .
An estimated 50,000 people had defied a ban on rallies and joined an opposition protest against the rule of Captain Moussa Dadis Camara , who seized power in a bloodless coup in December .
The military ruler had promised not to stand in elections in January but rumours that he would contest them after all prompted the democracy rally .

Citing hospital sources , Thierno Maadjou Sow , president of the Guinean Human Rights Organisation , told Reuters that at least 157 people had been killed and 1,253 injured in the violence .
But , amid reports that the security forces had swept corpses from the streets , Mr Sow said that his organisation 's death toll only included those people whose bodies had been brought to the city 's overwhelmed hospitals .
Witnesses recounted how security forces fired indiscriminately into the crowd just after noon on Monday .
" Our [ opposition ] leaders did n't even have a chance to speak .
I saw the armed men shooting directly into the crowds and shooting in the air – there was tear gas and gunshots and total panic ; we ran for our lives , " one witness told Human Rights Watch .
There were also reports of soldiers using knives and bayonets to finish off those protesters who had dodged the bullets , as well as female demonstrators being raped and sexually assaulted .
" They were raping women in broad daylight , " opposition activist Moctar Diallo told Radio France International .
" Women were stripped naked .
The soldiers were putting their rifles in the vaginas of these women ... I saw this myself . "
Despite members of his red beret - wearing presidential guard being involved in Monday 's bloodbath , Captain Camara shrugged off accusations of culpability , saying the security forces were beyond his control .
" I am very sorry , " the junta leader told Radio France International .
" This clash did not take place because of me ...
Those people who committed those atrocities were uncontrollable elements in the military .
Even I , as head of state in this very tense situation , cannot claim to be able to control those elements in the military . "
A later government statement noted that " according to preliminary investigations , most of the innocent victims died as a result of being crushed in the crowd . "
Mr Diallo called on the military ruler to stand down .
" The people of Guinea want him to leave , " he said .
" It 's not about whether [ he ] runs or not in next year 's election .
He needs to go now . "
Corinne Dufka , a West Africa expert at Human Rights Watch , said the slaughter was " shocking even by the abusive standards of Guinea 's coup government " .
The military junta had pledged to break with Guinea 's abusive past , she said ; " but these deadly acts of repression and excessive use of force show how empty those promises were " .
Captain Camara was unknown outside military circles until last December .
Six hours after the death of the dictator Lansana Conté was announced , he broke into the state broadcaster , went on air and declared a coup d'etat .
After a quarter of a century of President Conté 's rule , Guineans embraced the young captain and tuned in to the so - called Dadis show to see him name and shame drug barons , humiliate corrupt officials and interrogate the henchmen of the toppled authoritarian regime on television .
But the novelty value wore off , thanks to his unkept promises .
First he delayed elections until 2010 and then appeared to renege on a pledge to stay out of the race .
Unboring Ways To Get Things Done In Time
No one likes to work .
We all just want to have a good time and goof off instead of actually sitting down and getting things done to keep the bills paid .
Unless you have a job you love , you ’re probably stuck in the 9 - 5 rut that perpetually keeps you inundated with things to do .
But , work does n’t have to be miserable .
You probably go into work dreading what you have to do that day and end up playing around with your coworkers to avoid work and make light of the situation .
But , if you put your head down and get your work done in an organized and timely fashion , there ’s no reason why you ca n’t have have fun and time left over each and every day .
So you want to do some re-organizing ?
Get there early :
While it may seem like a foolish idea that you would never dream of , going into work early can help you get a lot accomplished in the day .
You may not have the option to do this but if you live close enough to the office , going in an hour or two before everyone else will keep your workspace quiet .
Without the distractions of your coworkers , you can focus on what has to get done and not be sidetracked by other on goings in the office .
Make a schedule : Outline what it is you have to accomplish every single week on a piece of paper or Word document .
With everything laid out you can then see what tasks are crucial to deadlines and which ones can be put off to later in the week .
With everything mapped out you can set yourself an hour by hour agenda that will help you stay focused and on task .
Build some breathing room in for yourself so you can have extra time if one project takes longer than you expected .
Take breaks :
You may be asking , “ why would I take a break if I ’m trying to get things done ? ”
The answer is simple .
If you take short breaks throughout the day , be it going to get some water from the break room , having a cigarette outside , or just chatting with the people next to you , you can keep yourself motivated .
The human brain does n’t like long tasks .
So breaking up your day and tasks into smaller increments by giving the brain a rest will help things flow more easily and you may even get things done FASTER because you ’ve taken a break in between .
Go home :
If your boss will let you , take some work home with you .
That ’ll get you out of the office that you hate so much and will give you some time in a comfortable environment .
Some people work the opposite way and need an office to function and get way too distracted at home , but some people need that personal comfort to work properly .
When all is said and done , you may have a day that finishes earlier than everyone else , allowing you time to go home and relax while everyone else is still at work .
I would love to know what it is you do to stay organized and get things done in time .
The metropolitan police are to investigate MI6 , the secret intelligence service , over alleged complicity in the torture of a terror suspect , in the second criminal investigation of the conduct of British intelligence officers in the war on the terror to be announced this year .
Now there are calls for a full public inquiry into the activities of the security and the intelligence services in their joint operations with the CIA .
Police have already begun an investigation into MI5 's possible complicity in the alleged torture of the British resident and former Guantanamo inmate Binyam Mohammed .
It is understood that MI6 referred the second case to the Attorney General , Baroness Scotland , after a review of its joint operations and intelligence - sharing with the CIA in connection with the interrogations of several terror suspects , many of whom have been or are still being held at Guantanamo .
The Foreign Office and the Metropolitan Police declined to name the second man at the centre of the inquiry , but speculation has centred on Abu Zubayda , the Saudi - born al - Qai'da leader subjected to beatings and waterboarding by the CIA .
Last month , the US Attorney General , Eric Holder , announced a criminal investigation into the interrogation techniques used by the CIA .
MI6 were known to be interested in Zubayda because of his links to British terror cells .
Any report published by the US government may incriminate British officers who worked with the CIA .
Scotland Yard said Baronness Scotland , asked it to investigate " the conditions under which a non-Briton was held " and the " potential involvement of British personnel " .
Clara Gutteridge , the Secret Prisons and Renditions Investigator at the human rights charity , Reprieve , said : " By blaming a few bad apples , the British Secret Services are allowing government ministers to avoid responsibility for crimes committed under their watch .
It is highly suspicious that the government still refuses to publish its guidelines to agents [ on dealing with evidence of torture ] from the period in question .
Sadly , it seems that only a full public inquiry will force our government to come clean on these allegations . "
Only last month , Sir John Scarlett , the head of MI6 , said there was " no torture and no complicity in torture " by SIS officers .
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said : " We can confirm that the Attorney General asked the Metropolitan Police to investigate a case that was a referral from the Secret Intelligence Service .
The police said that the case was unrelated to the ongoing investigation into MI5 's complicity in the alleged torture of Binyam Mohamed .
Victims of the war on terror ?
The allegations
Shaker Aamer
British resident who accused MI6 of complicity in his torture when he was held by the Americans in Afghanistan in 2002 .
He alleges that MI6 officers were present during his torture which he alleges includes having his head banged against a wall .
He is still being held in Guantanamo Bay despite the British government 's request for his release .
Mustafa Setmarian Nasser
A Spanish citizen of Syrian origin , held by the US on suspicion of terrorist activities .
Mustafa Nasar was seized in Pakistan in 2005 and handed to US forces .
He was then secretly flown to the British Overseas Territory , Diego Garcia and almost certainly held there .
Since then , he has disappeared .
He has links to Britain and may have been questioned by MI6 officers .
Abu Zubayda
A Saudi -born al - Qai'da leader who was subjected to beatings and waterboarding by the CIA .
He is accused of helping to recruit agents in the UK and may have been interrogated by MI6 officers .

Yakuza is an immensely popular series .
In Japan that is .
Unfortunately , the series has not picked up in North America at all since the release of the first Yakuza in 2006 .
SEGA is definitely aware of that , and has revealed a release date for Yakuza 3 .
The release date ?
Never .
According to The Examiner , the title will not hit NA shores , and instead stay in Japan .
The reason why SEGA will not bring Yakuza 3 is the simple fact that they ’re convinced it will not sell .
And in their defense , the Yakuza series has n’t sold well in North America on the PS2 .
With the recent announcement of Yakuza 4 , you can expect that title to skip out on a North American release as well .
Make sure to stick with PlayStation LifeStyle for all your news on the Yakuza series , including release dates , screenshots , and more .

Aerosmith , Roger Daltrey and -- get this --
Three Dog Night were all signed on to entertain 22,000 of Oracle 's best customers Oct. 14 in a former airplane hangar even older than the singers on San Francisco 's Treasure Island ... only up crops a problem .
The City of San Francisco had inexplicably gone and rented the hangar to the production crew of the NBC television show " Trauma , " according to this story in the San Francisco Chronicle .
( Incidentally -- or at least I presume it 's incidental -- the mayor 's actress wife , Jennifer Siebel Newsom , appeared in the pilot episode of " Trauma . "
Happy couple pictured . )
Fear not , though .
Presumably after Oracle pitched a fit ( total guess on my part ) the mayor 's office stepped up and offered to pitch a football - field - sized tent to replace the hangar as venue for Geriatric Entertainment Night .
( Sorry , I love Aerosmith and The Who as much as any child of the ' 70s , but is this a high - tech gathering or an AARP convention ? )
Tab for the tent : a cool $ 270,000 .
The Chronicle asked Mayor Gavin Newsom 's office for comment and got this galling response from Newsom toady Nathan Ballard : " If Donald Trump can build a tent for Moammar Khadafy , surely our friends at Oracle deserve the same hospitality . "
Perhaps he would n't have been quite so flip had the money been coming out of his pocket .
Now times are tough in the high - tech industry , but Oracle last year made a profit of $ 5.6 billion on revenue of $ 23.2 billion .
Not bad .
They 're willing to spend $ 7.4 billion to buy Sun .
And , of course , Oracle head honcho Larry Ellison is among the most ostentatiously rich people on the planet ; Forbes has him pegged at No. 4 , worth a sweet $ 22.5 billion .
Meanwhile , San Francisco 's municipal finances have been anything but rosy given the destitute state of that state .
Under the circumstances , could n't the company -- or Ellison himself -- have picked up the tab for that tent instead of sticking it to the already traumatized taxpayers of San Francisco ?
If not , the least the mayor 's office could have done is apologize for the costly screw - up .
LAS VEGAS -- Floyd Mayweather Jr. weighed in at 146 pounds on Friday afternoon , two pounds heavier than the weight stipulated in the contract for his comeback fight against lightweight champion Juan Manuel Marquez on Saturday night at the MGM Grand Garden Arena .
The excess weight will cost Mayweather $ 300,000 per pound , meaning Marquez will get an additional $ 600,000 on top of his $ 3.2 million guarantee , a source told ESPN.com .
Mayweather 's minimum guarantee is $ 10 million , a figure likely to dramatically increase after the pay - per - view receipts are counted .
Marquez , who has never fought heavier than 135 pounds , comfortably made 142 pounds , two less than the 144 - pound contract weight .
At Mayweather 's request , nobody would speak publicly about the contract weight throughout the promotion that kicked off in early May and continued into the fall when the fight was postponed from July 18 because of a Mayweather rib injury .
However , several sources with direct knowledge of the contract told ESPN.com all along that the contract maximum weight was 144 pounds , three less than the 147 - pound welterweight maximum .
But after Friday 's weigh - in , Golden Boy CEO Richard Schaefer finally addressed the issue , telling ESPN.com , " The fight was contracted as a welterweight fight with an agreed upon weight of 144 pounds .
However , there were pre-negotiated weight penalties built in . "
Schaefer would not disclose the dollar figure , but another source with direct knowledge of the contract told ESPN.com that the penalty was $ 300,000 per pound if either fighter was overweight .
According to the source , the Marquez camp knew Wednesday night that Mayweather would not make weight because Mayweather 's team made overtures to Golden Boy Promotions in an effort to have Marquez agree to change weight on the bout agreements to be filed with the Nevada State Athletic Commission .
However , Marquez 's contract had already been filed reading 144 pounds , according to commission executive director Keith Kizer .
But Kizer said the bout agreement was retrieved from the commission by Golden Boy Promotions and changed to 147 with Marquez initialing it .
Mayweather 's contract with 147 pounds was not filed with the commission until minutes before the weigh - in .
Kizer said it was supposed to be filed on Wednesday .
Kizer said the Mayweather camp asked to file it Thursday and he said OK , but that deadline also came and went .
" We were very unhappy with the lateness of Mr. Mayweather 's contract , " Kizer said .
Kizer said that had the bout agreements not been changed to 147 , Mayweather would have faced a fine from the commission in addition to whatever penalty he had agreed to pay Marquez .
For being two pounds overweight , Kizer said the penalty would have been 10 percent of his purse , or $ 1 million .
Had he been three pounds over ( 147 pounds ) , the figure would have jumped to a 20 percent fine .

In - N- Out : the 20 x 20
with help from John Marcotte
It all started — as you would expect — when we were drunk .
Somehow my cousin Greg and I got on the topic of eating and we got into a little argument about who could eat more .
I told him that I was going to go to In - N - Out and eat a 10 × 10 , 10 beef patties , 10 slices of cheese .
The strange thing was , it still sounded like a good idea to me when I sobered up .
Greg and I are the same height ( 6 ’ 2 ″  ) , weight ( 200 ) , and age ( 20 ) , so all things considered , it was a fair contest .
I picked up a 10×10 on the way down to Santa Barbara with my best friend Miles .
We stopped at the Salinas In - N - Out .
I easily ate the 10×10 .
Hell , I even managed to scarf down an order of fries and a soda on the side .
I called up Greg and let him know the game was on .
I pretty much forgot about the whole thing , until about a month later .
I got a phone call from Greg .
He started talking trash saying that he did an 11 × 11 — no problem — with fries and a soda .
He held the record for about two weeks .
Then I was ready for a 12 × 12 — no problem .
I called Greg to tell him the news and to talk a little trash .
That ’s when things started to escalate .
Greg decided to eat a 15 × 15 .
He figured that would be a gastro - intestinal knock - out punch .
A few months passed by and I pretty much decided that he was all mouth and no stomach .
I called him out .
He responded that he did n’t have a chance to go to In - N - Out .
OK , that ’s actually pretty legit .
The nearest In - N - Out is more than a half - hour from our school .
It was hard for either of us to get to an In - N - Out .
That did n’t stop me from talking a little more trash .
A few weeks later Greg still had n’t topped my 12 × 12 , but I tickets to an A ’s game in the City , so I decided to go for the jugular and take Greg out of the game permanently .
I would eat a 20 × 20 .
I brought my friends Jason and Wendy to act as witnesses , and also because I figured one of them might know CPR .
We even left early so that I would have lots of time to slide all that beefy - cheesy goodness down my throat .
On the drive to meet my hamburger destiny , I began to get nervous .
A 20 ×20 is a whole lot of meat , and quite frankly — I was scared .
I took a deep breath and reminded myself that nerves are for wusses — like Greg .
“ I will have a 20 × 20 and a soda , ”  may go down in history as the best thing I ’ll ever say in a fast - food establishment .
The cashier looked up from her register , to make sure I was serious .
I was .
With a stunned look on her face , she began to enter the order into the register .
Apparently a 20 ×20 is complicated , because it took a good five minutes and about three employees to get it entered in .
By this time everyone that worked there had heard about the order and one by one they came over to look at the freak while I was waiting to pay .
I think I ’m now a permanent part of In - N - Out lore .
They charged me about $ 22 .
I ’m pretty sure that they did n’t charge me for a few of the patties .
Sure , it may have been a technical snafu from a complicated order .
But I choose to believe that they gave me the discount to recognize the greatness of what I was attempting to accomplish .
At any rate , they were all on the burger .
I counted .
They called my number .
I could feel my stomach acid churning as I walked up to pick up the order .
I told myself it was just because I was really hungry .
Five employees handed me the burger .
I ’m guessing they all wanted to be a small part of greatness .
When they handed me the tray , I got a new theory : it takes five people to carry this thing .
It was heavy .
After actually seeing the thing , Jason and Wendy decided that there was no way I could eat it .
And even if I could , I probably should n’t .
I decided that unwarranted optimism was my first line of defense .
“ Meh. No problem . ” 
I sucked down some Sprite and dug in .
I started with four patties with cheese and the bottom bun .
They went down fast .
The middle sections were trickier , as there was no bun to grab .
But , no guts , no glory — I grabbed another four off the bottom .
Cheese oozed between my fingers .
I ate them
Five minutes in and eight patties were gone .
I was averaging better than a patty per minute .
I started on the next 4 patties .
At this point the entire staff of In - N - Out dropped the pretense that they cared about the drive - thru window , other customers , etc. and all gathered around my booth to watch me eat .
They were all surprised to see how far I had gotten .
One of the cooks finally spoke up and said , “ I am so proud that you are eating my burger .
The only time we have ever seen one anywhere near that big was a practical joke we did on our friend for his birthday and he only ate seven . ” 
I think he may have been crying .
I ate another four .
Twelve down — eight to go .
The staff reluctantly went back to work , leaving a spy .
One employee was busy sweeping the same two feet of floor in front of the trash can .
There was n’t any dirt there .
But he only had eyes for my burger .
Right about then I started feeling it .
I nursed the Sprite for a bit .
Then got a refill .
It took almost 15 minutes to eat patties 13 through 16 .
The staff lost interest .
Even my friends became skeptical .
Jason told me point blank , “ You are never going to finish that thing . ” 
I started to believe him .
By this time , I was chewing on rubber .
After 16 patties , even delicious In - N - Out makes you want to shoot yourself .
Another 20 minutes passed as I struggled with the last four patties .
There were only about four or five bites left , but those four or five bites seemed impossible .
It was n’t that my stomach was ready to burst .
It was just the pain of swallowing .
Each bite I had to fight down because it was like I forgot how to swallow .
My saliva glands mutinied .
They wanted no part of the 20 ×20 .
I guess that is the body ’s reaction when it wants you to stop eating .
I felt drained .
I hunched over the tray and poured soda and water down my gullet to lubricate the way for the last four patties .
It was me or the burger , and damn if I was going to let some USDA Choice Beef get the better of me .
I hunched over the tray and poured soda and water down my gullet to lubricate the way for those last four bites .
I finished the bite number four , grabbed a glass of water , threw my keys to Wendy , walked straight to my car and laid down in the back seat .
I thought I was dying .
Is beef poisoning a disease ?
It should be .
In all seriousness , this was by far the hardest thing that I have ever done in my entire life .
I was in more pain then when I broke my arm .
I passed out in the back of the car , and slept for a good hour and thirty minutes until we got to the ball park .
Jason woke me up .
I felt a little better , but I still felt like God had abandoned me and the terrible , satanic beef devil had devoured my soul .
Did you know that if you eat enough ground beef , you start to feel like ground beef ?
At that point I would n’t have been surprised if someone told me I looked like ground beef .
We met a few more of my friends in line .
Brett took one look at me and said , “ You look like shit .
Did you finish ? ” 
They all began to laugh until Jason said , “ Sure did . ” 
The power of beef brought silence to the masses .
No one thought it was possible .
They were dumbfounded .
Brett actually tried to buy me a jumbo dog during the game .
I just shook my head and laughed .
By the end of the game I felt a lot better .
So I sent Greg a text message that read , “ Consider the 20 ×20 in the record books , bitch ! ” 
It may have been a stupid idea when we were drunk , and stupider yet when we were sober , but that 20 × 20 is now my claim to fame .
The story has traveled far beyond my immediate circle of friends , and I think people look at me differently now .
Perhaps with a mixture of pity , admiration and fear .
As a follow up , I bet some of you are wondering how it all came out .
Well , it came out the same way it went in , four patties at a time .

This robot has skills !
Speed is the key to the sweet robotic hand from Ishikawa Komuro Labs at Tokyo University .
We are talking fast .
In the video you ’ll see after the break , this robotic hand bounces a ball quicker than the eye can track .
The same hand is able to catch a variety of speeding objects , twirl a stick with high - speed bravado , and even change where it puts its opposable thumbs .
Not satisfied with that ?
Well , it ’s also a key ingredient in the development of baseball playing robots .
Singularity Hub has that video for you after the break as well .
Now , I know you ’re wondering , who would win in a contest between the flexpicker and these Ishikawa bots ?
Well , my money ’s on these quick and capable hands .
Sure , the flexpicker is an automated wonder that makes Santa ’s elves look like slackers , but can the flex picker bounce a ball while giving you the finger ?
Did n’t think so .
But why just compare hand speed ?
Quick hands are nothing without quick eyes .
The Ishikawa bots use rapid laser scans ( saccades if you want to get technical ) and a ultrafast camera to track and predict where objects will move .
Without these saccades , the hands would n’t be able to find the ball to catch , and they certianly would n’t be able to dribble a ball like a Harlem Globetrotter on steroids .
Yep , these robots prove the old engineer ’s adage : “ if you want to make something cooler , put a laser on it . ”
Now , for those of you who got a kick out of seeing robotic chefs working at a Japanese restaurant , this second video from Ishikawa Komuro Labs is really your thing .
Different versions of this vid made its way around in the past few months , and these pitching and batting robots are still pretty new .
Which is why they wo n’t blow your mind with their speed .
But still , robots playing baseball – how cool is that ?
Want robots to play more sports ?
It all comes back to the hands .
Whereas flexpicker , the chef robots , and the batting robot all have great appendages , Ishikawa ’s robot hands show the ability for robots to mimic and exceed human dexterity .
The versatility of the human hand has held up over thousands of years of evolution .
I ca n’t wait to see what the robotic versions achieve next .
CHATTANOOGA , Tennessee ( CNN ) --
An annual family boating trip to the Florida Keys took a bloody and life - changing turn for Jordan Thomas .
Noah Parton , 6 , got prosthetics from foundation started by Jordan Thomas , right .
" It was a beautiful day , and we were going to go scuba diving , " said Thomas , who was 16 during the 2005 trip .
But when he jumped into the water , the boat 's wake dragged Thomas hard into sharp , whirling propellers .
He immediately knew what was about to happen .
Vote now for the CNN Hero of the Year
" I looked down -- my black fins were gone , and all I saw was red just everywhere , " said Thomas , an athletic teen who was captain of his high school 's golf team .
" But I had this unbelievable calmness over my body . "
His father and mother , both doctors from Chattanooga , Tennessee , jumped into action .
" All of a sudden , my 16 - year old , happy - go - lucky captain of the golf team was potentially dying , " said Dr. Liz Kennedy - Thomas .
Watch Thomas tell his story »
She worked to stanch the blood flow from her son's legs while his father rushed the boat to shore and fetched paramedics .
Thomas was rushed to a hospital , where he spent the next two weeks undergoing several surgeries on what was left of his legs and , along the way , discovering what would become his life 's work .
While there , Thomas visited other amputees .
" I just remember seeing so many kids who did n't have parents , did n't have health care , " he said .
" I just knew that the future was grim for them . "
Impact Your World See how you can make a difference
The top - of - the - line prosthetics Thomas was fitted with -- the ones that helped him return to the golf links -- cost about $ 24,000 .
He learned that many insurance plans cover only about $ 5,000 .
That 's especially tough on child amputees , who will outgrow several limbs before adulthood .
" I had no clue , " he said .
" It 's one of those things , unless you 're affected by it , you just do n't know . "
Thomas knew he was lucky .
With a financially stable family , he 'll always be able to afford good legs .
He asked his family to give a donation to help others , but ultimately , with their support , the teenager launched a fundraising foundation to provide life - changing prosthetics to children in need .
" By the time we got home , we had bracelets -- all kinds of stuff , " Kennedy - Thomas said .
" The foundation was just sort of started by the time we got home . "
The Jordan Thomas Foundation has raised more than $ 400,000 through bracelets , charity golf tournaments and cookouts .
Some of that is paying for ongoing prosthetics for three children until they reach age 18 .
One of them is Noah Parton .
The precocious 6 - year - old was born with a congenital heart defect and had a complication with a tube inserted in his right leg , leading to an amputation above his knee .
His family 's insurance would pay only for a " stubby , " a wooden artificial leg without a bendable knee .
" His first bendable knee ... did n't have a certain number or something that would apply , and they refused to pay for it , " said Noah 's mother , Nancy Parton , who lives with her son about an hour north of Chattanooga , in Evensville , Tennessee .
Noah could n't run and play with other children .
And even day - to - day activities were tough .
" It was hard to put him in the car because his leg stuck out straight .
And I 'd have my seat up as far as it would go , and it would still hit the back of the seat , " she said .
Thomas ' foundation stepped in , buying Noah several knee devices -- a new one for each new leg he needs as he grows -- and a foot .
" He 's so proud to show off how his knee bends , " Thomas said .
" And his foot has a split toe so he can wear sandals like his parents . "
Watch Noah show off his bendable knee prosthetic to Thomas »
Now , his mom says , Noah is unstoppable .
" He loves to climb stairs now ; he tries to ride bicycles , " she said .
" You name it , he does it .
" Take him to the park [ with ] any other kid ; he 'll just blow you away . "
While Thomas says his foundation still has a " mom- and - pop " feel , they plan to continue growing to help more children in need .
" If we provide them with prosthetics , " said Thomas , " then that creates a whole gambit of opportunity for them to achieve whatever they want ... and I think they deserve that . "
As Congress debates overhauling the nation 's health care system , prosthetics are quietly getting some attention .
In May , Rep. Robert Andrews , a New Jersey Democrat , introduced the Prosthetic and Custom Orthotic Parity Act , which would require insurance companies to cover prosthetics at the same rate they do surgery .
" It 's pretty simple , " Andrews said .
" Prosthetic devices are not cosmetic .
You can't walk without one or you can't lift something without one , and I think one of the reasons people are so upset about the health care system in this country is they had hassles like this . "
Seventeen states have passed similar laws , most recently Missouri .
But amputee advocates say there needs to be a national law .
According to the Amputee Coalition of America , there are nearly 2 million amputees in the United States , and at least 25,000 of them are children .
Kendra Calhoun , president and CEO of the coalition , said that with more sweeping health care legislation taking all the attention , " our biggest hurdle [ for a prosthetics law ] right now is being heard . "
Some insurance companies have said that premiums would go up for everyone if they were forced to cover prosthetics to the extent advocates want .
Advocates cite a study that they say shows it would cost beneficiaries about five cents per month .
Meanwhile , Thomas , a full - time college student in Charleston , South Carolina , spent the summer at home in Chattanooga working at a prosthetics and orthotics company .
" It is rewarding to actually make this stuff and work and then say , ' Now this guy 's going to actually wear that , ' " he said .
Thomas has no plans to slow down .
He says he would like to become a voice for the amputee community and help many more children live " normal and happy , productive lives . "
" When you 're thrown into the situation , you just kind of adapt and you make the best of it , " Thomas said .
" There 's nothing that I really cannot do . "

All About Health Care Policy
The state has officially run out of money .
The state government unable to govern themselves out of a paper bag missed the fiscal year deadline ( again ) and here we are starting the second half in a massive deficit .
The crony bailout continues with absurd ideas but the second half recovery pundits are out in full force .
Since this is the bottom , the Governator with no re-election and nothing to lose decided to give 200,000 state employees another day off formalizing a 14 percent wage cut .
As I discussed in a previous article we are in the midst of deflation created by demand destruction .
California has relied on two gigantic bubbles with technology and now real estate over the span of two decades to spend beyond its means .
Now , with no other bubble in the foreseeable future time has run out .
Why has the state run out of money ?
First , a large portion of money is pulled from personal income taxes and another large portion comes from sales and use tax :
Over 83 percent of the states revenue comes from two extremely volatile sources .
This week I happened to get the wonderful news that Los Angeles County now has a 9.75 percent sales tax !
So not only do you get taxed on your income , now you will get taxed when you go buy goods .
And look at what kind of great government we have in Sacramento for this high tax rate .
The best that IOU money can buy !
Here is a problem with the current system .
No one has the ability to tell people in the state that we are flat broke !
I ’ve noticed the pundits are out in full force again with horrible ideas about buying toxic mortgages and bottom callers are out in mass again preaching to their housing gods .
Dumb and Dumber – I.O.U .
In another smart move worthy of a Noble Prize , the state has decided to offer IOUs :
“ SACRAMENTO – In a move certain to draw national ridicule and exact financial hardship on business owners and taxpayers across the state , California is slated today to begin paying billions of dollars in bills with IOUs instead of cash .
Nearly 30,000 IOUs totaling more than $ 53 million are expected to be sent out by state Controller John Chiang this afternoon , the day after Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger declared a fiscal emergency in the face of a staggering $ 24.3 billion deficit .
The state Legislature remained in its familiar state of gridlock , raising the prospect of an extended standoff that further damages the state ’s financial reputation . ”
If you have noticed unlike the early 1990s not many banks have come out and stated publicly that they ’ll honor these IOUs .
It is likely that many will honor the IOUs but the banks are flat out broke too !
We are going to give people monopoly money so they can go and deposit their funds into a bank that is broke so it can then lend it out to people with no money !
This is the solution to the $ 26.3 billion shortfall .
But was n’t it $ 24.3 billion on Tuesday night ?
Yes it was .
So buy the end of the month people in jail will be getting legit get out of jail cards .
“ CHICAGO , June 29 ( Reuters ) – Michigan has to close prisons to save money .
California ’s are bursting at the seams .
Both states are struggling with huge budget gaps .
Now , Michigan Governor Jennifer Granholm has offered California some of the state ’s prisons that are slated to close at a yet - to - be - determined cost . ”
Well I guess we ’ve found one export we can depend on .
The budget is in shambles because each year , we go through this song and dance and eventually , a budget does pass but it is basically a patchwork of delaying reality for another day .
That day has come .
Asking the Federal government to bail us out would be a nice form of beggar thy neighbor .
Even though Bernard Madoff is getting 150 years in prison , there are far more corrupt things going on right now .
Two of those things involve California and National Housing .
OCC and OTS Show Country insane like State
Earlier this week the OCC and OTS released their first quarter results on the health of the mortgage market .
As you may have guessed , lenders across the country are as blind as those in California .
Some have thrown out the idea that the government should simply buy up all the toxic debt .
When they say the government , they mean you and every other taxpayer .
The public - private investment program , which ironically is anything but an investment and does not resemble a partnership , is one of these crony banking ideas .
Yet that does n’t resolve the fact that if you are unemployed or have a mega - mortgage then any housing payment is a burden that is n’t within your budget !
These programs are to aid Wall Street and all lenders that are still living in their delusional crony world of housing bubble economics .
Yet some of the public are taking notice .
During the Great Depression the word banker took on a negative connotation and I do n’t see how it is avoided during our Great Recession .
But let us look at those OCC and OTS stats :
This is important information so let us spend some time here .
This data covers approximately 64 percent of all first lien mortgages .
In the data covered by the report , we have a sample of 34 million mortgages .
Of these 34 million mortgages , we can say that 11.8 million loans ( the Alt - A , subprime , and other ) are questionable .
Essentially 34 percent of the entire portfolio is made up of junk !
Here is the breakdown of the loan categories :
This is junk !
In fact , that “ other ” category is a mix of Alt - A , subprime , and prime but these are loans made with no credit scores or low documentation !
Who in the world knows what this crap is .
We have a better chance of guessing what is floating in the Los Angeles River .
And those in the housing industry are eagerly waiting to unload this crap to the public .
Let us just assume that the entire portfolio has mortgages with the same balance .
34 percent of $ 6 trillion is $ 2.04 trillion !
As you all know 634,000 of those Alt - A loans are here in California with an average balance of $ 420,000 + .
According to data from the OCC and OTS , there are still 3.5 million Alt - A loans floating out there .
But fear not , loan modifications are way up .
Let us look at that data :
The crap California is doing is nationwide .
That is , with loan modifications and workouts the main strategy is to convert loans into option ARM , low teaser rate , 40 - year mortgages .
Take a look at those principal reductions !
Bwahahaha !
Now you know why they ripped out all that cram - down legislation .
With bankruptcies skyrocketing many of these loan modifications and workouts are basically converting people to renters and locking in the bubble price of the home .
Think of a situation in our current market .
You buy a home at the peak for $ 500,000 and the home is now worth $ 300,000 .
Their idea of a workout is turning your loan into a 40 - year mortgage with a teaser rate .
But what happens when you want to sell ?
You can ’t !
Homeowners are now being swindled once again by the same banks that issued this toxic waste under the guise of “ helping ” you .
Sort of like how Bernard Madoff helped all his investors ; things look good until you read the fine print or dig deeper .
The Alt - A and option ARM wave is going to hit California like a tsunami especially in the more so - called prime areas .
Some of these people think they are insulated from the rest of the state economy in silos .
They are going to find out the hard way in the next few months .
What the OCC and OTS data tells us is this problem goes beyond California .
You can look at Florida , Nevada , and Arizona and these states are loaded as well with these toxic mortgages .
Yet you will find the toxic waste in every state .
And to show you how much a waste of time this is look at the re-default rates :
If we extend this out to another year and break the data out by Alt - A , subprime , and prime I bet you would see in some categories a 90 percent plus re-default rate .
The data is telling us this is a waste of time .
It seems like people are hell bound to repeat the lessons from Japan .
Some people have told me , “ but California housing is now affordable .
It is a good time to buy . ”
I have decided to compile a list of median household income and median home prices for all California counties to show you that we are still over priced in many regions :
The above chart sums up the California situation .
What you have is the lower - end being pummeled and now having more modest price to income metrics .
Yet those higher priced areas , those areas with the 643,000 Alt - A mortgages with a nice average sum of $ 420,000 + are going to take it on the chin next .
These numbers are simply unsupportable .
Bottom callers are drinking the Kool - Aid once again .
Ironically , we may see the median price stabilize but this does not show the real story .
The mid to upper range of the market will fall , creating more sales , and thus creating volume to shift the median price up .
For example , say a place like Culver City has a $ 600,000 home that sits on the market for ages .
The place has a nice Alt - A , the borrower walks away and the bank is forced to unload it .
It goes for $ 400,000 .
The median price for L.A. County is $ 300,000 so this gives fuel to a higher median price but the place took a $ 200,000 hit .
This will happen .
The state has an 11.5 percent unemployment rate ( the highest in record keeping history ) , the state is slashing the wages of 200,000 employees , more layoffs are in the pipeline , the Alt - A and option ARM problem is not being addressed by delusional loan mods and workouts , and yet this is the bottom .
What high paying industry is being created to give birth to the new era of suckers that will over pay for housing in those so - called prime areas ?
Maybe we can start buying homes with IOUs .
Orange County had a median price of $ 258,000 in 2000 and Los Angeles County had a median price of $ 192,000 .
Just think of that when you see the current median price for Orange County of $ 411,000 and $ 300,000 for Los Angeles .
To describe the problem takes much analysis .
Solution ?
Let these homes foreclose as quickly as possible and let banks fail .
But too many people believe in the Angelo Mozilo school of , “ homeownership is not a privilege but a right ! ”

An international gathering of youth and children , billed as the largest ever of its type on climate change , Thursday pressed world leaders to do far more to curb damage to the environment .

“ We young people -- 3 billion of the world population -- are very concerned and frustrated that our governments are not doing enough to combat climate change ... we feel that radical and holistic measures are needed urgently from us all , ” they said in a statement following their conference in Deajeon in South Korea , itself one of the world ’s fastest growing polluters .
“ We now need more actions and less talking . ”
Organized by the U.N. Environment Program ( UNEP ) , the some 700 people from 10 to 24 years old and from dozens of countries met to discuss their concerns ahead of the U.N. climate conference in December in Copenhagen .
That meeting will try to find an agreement to replace the Kyoto Protocol and set limits on emissions that are driving up global temperatures .
“ We are the generation of tomorrow .
The decisions that are made today will define our future and the world we have to live in .
So we young people of the world urge governments to commit to a strong post - Kyoto climate regime .
It is our lives we are talking about , ” UNEP quoted 23 - year - old delegate Anne Walraven as saying .
The statement also urged governments to impose strict laws on polluters , develop independently - monitored carbon action plans and encourage greater use of green fuels .
“ Make engaging environmental education mandatory in schools and universities and promote community environmental awareness -- an informed public is a powerful public . ”
And they called on ordinary people to use alternative transport , pressure businesses to come up with environmentally - friendly products and push their own governments to act to improve the environment .
UNEP said they pledged to stage large rallies across 100 capitals to urge global leaders to take action on climate change under the U.N. ’s “ Seal the Deal ! ” campaign .
For fifteen years , Fatima Abed Rabbo lived as a girl in the northern Gaza neighborhood of Jabalya .
She wore girl 's clothing , and went to an all - girl 's school .
But shortly after turning 12 , Fatima , now renamed Odai , recalls undergoing changes : " I was normal .
I used to be a girl and my name was Fatima .
Before my father found out and the doctors checked me , I felt like a girl .
But after I turned 12 years old , I began feeling more like a boy than a girl . "
Majd Abed Rabbo , Odai 's father , said that following several medical tests , a hormonal imbalance was detected in Odai .
The results showed that Odai had high levels of testosterone and needed a sex - change operation .
He is not the only transgendered person in his family .
Odai 's cousin was once a female named , " Ola " .
Now he is a male named , " Nader " .
The decision to pursue a sex change , Majd maintains , was a difficult one .
Gaza 's conservative society , along with difficult economic conditions , made it extremely difficult to take this life - altering decision .
But about five months ago , Majd said , a team of Spanish Urologists performed the operation : " Here in the Gaza Strip , the doctor wanted to charge $ 3,000 per surgery ( out of a total of three ) .
Since I could not afford that , I decided to go abroad .
" While making travel arrangements , a Spanish medical delegation specializing in Urology happened to be visiting the Strip .
So I went to al - Awda hospital and met with the doctors .
The ( Spanish ) doctor checked him just two days before he traveled back .
He performed only one surgery instead of three , " Majd said .
Odai will continue to receive testosterone injections for the next eight months , and will have to undergo an additional surgery which will link Odai 's penis to his urine tract .
" I feel much more comfortable now , I feel like I was born again .
I feel free .
Anyway , I prefer now to be male because this society privileges males over females .
The women in our society are not respected , and their ideas are not respected either .
This society is much more acceptant of males than females , " said Odai .

A chat with Sam Trammell , Sam Trammell interview , True Blood , Sam Merlotte
TV Home / Entertainment Channel / Bullz - Eye Home
If you ’re going to play Sam Merlotte , the resident shapeshifter of Bon Temps , Louisiana , then you ’ve quickly got to get over any issues of modesty that you may have .
Fortunately , when it comes to getting naked , Sam Trammell is a professional : before getting his gig on “ True Blood , ” Trammell ’s work as a stage actor had already found him undressing in front of an audience .
Whether or not he ’ll be back in his birthday suit for the second - season finale of “ True Blood ” remains to be seen , however , as Trammell was understandably hesitant to divulge any spoilers , but we did discuss quite a few other things about his time on the HBO series , as well as several other items on his resume , including “ Law & Order : Criminal Intent , ” “ Alien vs. Predator : Requiem , ” and his surprising connection to alligators in his various projects .
First , though , we had to chat about the last time we saw each other …and what the topic of conversation had been .
Bullz - Eye : Hey , man , how are you doing ?
Sam Trammell : I ’m good !
How are you doing ?
BE : I ’m good .
So , did you just want to talk about the Psychedelic Furs for half an hour or so ?
Because when we were talking after the TCA Awards , I think we spent more time talking about the Furs than we did “ True Blood . ”
ST : ( Laughs ) Yeah , absolutely !
I ’m always ready to talk about the Furs !
So how have you been , man ?
BE : I ’ve been good .
ST : Good !
Yeah , that was a fun night , a pretty cool time .
BE : It absolutely was .
My wife says to say , “ Hi , ” and that we ’re both psyched for the season finale come Sunday night .
ST : Good !
It ’s gonna be…well , you know , it ’s gonna be intense , as you can imagine .
Very , very intense .
BE : I talked to Michelle Forbes that same night , and she said that she could n’t believe they were going go where they did with the finale , but they did , and it was awesome .
Would you agree with that assessment ?
" I was sent the script ( for ' True Blood ' ) , and I do n’t think I realized it took place in Louisiana , but when I read that , I just thought I ’d be perfect for it , because I ’m from Louisiana .
But Alan Ball and HBO … just those two things , I was immediately , ' I ’ll do it .
I do n’t know even know what it is , but I ’ll do it . "
ST : ( Laughs )
Oh , yeah , I ’d agree .
It ’s pretty …it ’s pretty nuts .
I mean , the whole year has been so nuts , but people have really been on board for it .
It feels like the audiences have been accepting , into it , and just going along for the ride … which is great , because Alan ( Ball ) and the writers just really were not playing it safe at all .
They were just going for it and having fun this year , so it ’s good that people are liking it .
BE : I guess it ’s confirmation that you guys are doing a good job that Charlaine Harris is turning up in the finale .
ST : Yeah !
I mean , Charlaine and Alan have a really good relationship .
She ’s told me that she does n’t tell them how to produce , and he does n’t tell her how to write the books … ( Laughs ) … so that ’s all for good .
But she ’s awesome .
She ’s a great , fun person , and I like her a lot .
BE : My mother - in - law is forever telling me , “ I love it , but I wish they did n’t change it from the books so much ! ”
ST : ( Laughs ) Yeah , I know .
Well , a lot of people are …there are a lot of fans of the books , and on our show , Alan definitely goes out on tangents , for sure , and new characters are created .
But in general , we ’re following the books each year .
In general .
( Laughs )
BE : When he does take a tangent like that , do you know if he checks with her first , or does he just hope for the best ?
ST : You know , I ’m not sure , but I think he just hopes for the best .
( Laughs ) I do n’t think he ’s checking in with her .
Like I said , he ’s …well , first of all , Alan loves the books , which is why this whole thing got started in the first place , so he ’s more than happy to follow along for the most part .
But , you know , he wants to do his own thing a little bit , so he just does .
BE : So take me back to the beginning .
How did you first come on board the series ?
ST : I was just sent a script .
I ’d kind of heard about it , and I was sent the script , and I do n’t think I realized it took place in Louisiana , but when I read that , I just thought I ’d be perfect for it , because I ’m from Louisiana .
But Alan Ball and HBO … just those two things , I was immediately , “ I ’ll do it .
I do n’t know even know what it is , but I ’ll do it . ”
But then I read it , and I just thought it was an amazing world and a great character .
Alan was out of town , so I went in and auditioned for the casting director , who put me on tape .
And Alan liked the tape and decided that he wanted to test me , so I went in and met with him , and he gave me some notes and sort of told me about the series .
Then I went in and read for HBO , which is sort of the big final audition , where you have to sign all of these contracts before you even go in .
It ’s very stressful .
So all of these HBO executives are sitting in these leather chairs , and you go up on the stage .
And I auditioned , and …well , you never can tell , but I thought it went all right .
But I did n’t go , like , “ I got it , ” because there were other people there for the part .
But I got a call about two hours later … which is relatively quickly … saying that I ’d gotten the part .
So it was just , like , a week and a half between getting the script and getting the part , which is really quick .
It was very satisfying , to say the least .
I mean , I was screaming in my car when I found out .
I ’ll never forget that moment .
It was just so exciting .
BE : Well , given the character ’s name , it ’s obvious that you ’d be interested in that role , but were there any other roles that you could envision yourself playing when you read the script ?
ST : You know , I thought Jason ’s part was really fun as well .
I thought that would be a good part .
And , you know , the vampire … that would ’ve been good , too , but I knew that they sort of wanted somebody European .
They did n’t want an American .
They wanted someone who just seemed different … not that the Europeans are that different from Americans … ( Laughs )
BE : ( Laughs ) Nice save .
ST : … but , yeah , to answer your question , Jason ’s part seemed really interesting .
BE : So were you familiar with the books at all ?
Had you read them prior to that ?
ST : I had n’t .
I had not read the books , no , and I was n’t familiar with them , though I did read four or five of them , just to kind of get a sense of …well , just to make sure there were n’t any surprises .
That , like , Sam Merlotte ’s not a transvestite or something .
( Laughs )
And , also , just to make sure that I knew who the character was , and to get a sense of the world .
That sort of thing .
BE : Sam ’s come a long way since the beginning of the series .
At first , it looked like he was just going to be someone with an unrequited love for Sookie , but then he turned out to be a shapeshifter , and this season it ’s just all gone to hell .
ST : ( Laughs ) I know , I know !
Yeah , y’know , Alan told me that it was going to sort of start off a little slow , and then , obviously , pick up , because Sam ’s one of the major characters in the books .
So I sort of knew it was going to be that route , and it was kind of cool , because … it was kind of fun being sort of a red herring that first year , with people thinking that I ’m the murderer in town .
There was that little moment where I think people were suspicious of me , and that was fun to play .
But , yeah , this season has just been really fun , ‘ cause Sam ’s just been under the gun the whole time .
I mean , literally , from the very beginning , when he knows Maryann ’s in town .
He knew how much trouble she was when nobody else did , so he sort of has the weight of the world on his shoulders from the very beginning .
And then the stuff with Daphne , which was just so cool , that all the while she was working for Maryanne .
I got to have a great scene with her where she told me some beautiful stuff about how I should love myself and trust myself and open up .
And , then , of course , she betrays me , so I do n’t know how Sam ’s going to take that .
( Laughs )
There could be some bad repercussions .
" Most of the time when people have to get naked , it ’s for a sex scene or it ’s post - coital , and they ’re in a bedroom and it ’s kind of a closed set .
But with Sam , it always seems to be because he ’s turning back into himself from being an animal , so I ’m always outside .
Like , way out .
Like , out for everybody to see . "
BE : Yeah , that whole sequence was pretty rough .
ST : Yeah , as far as Sam opening up again to a woman , that ’s gonna be tough .
BE : So , what , in Season 3 , Sam enters a monastery ?
ST : ( Laughs ) Yeah , I mean , there ’s just so much torture for Sam this year , and …yeah , just a lot of torture .
It just does n’t stop .
BE : Michelle Forbes is so overwhelming as a force of evil on the show that …I mean , it ’s reached a point with some of the readers of our “ True Blood ” blog , where they ’re , like , “ Okay , she ’s good , but she needs to go . ”
ST : ( Laughs ) Yeah , she ’s so good .
She ’s really one of my favorite actresses on the show .
She ’s just fantastic .
She really embodied that role , and she had such an ease with it .
She really just kind of captured the fun of Maryann as well as the evil … because Maryann ’s all about fun , really .
It ’s just that , to have that fun , you have to manifest the evil .
But she ’s great , and we got to work together a good bit , so that was fun .
BE : So you ’ve had a lot of work this season with …well , I still refer to him as Detective Andy .
So what ’s his deal ?
It seems like he should ’ve fallen under Maryann ’s spell a long time ago , but he has n’t .
Are we going to find out what ’s up with that during the final episode ?
ST : Oh , you just might .
You juuuuuuust might .
( Laughs )
You ’re right , Andy has n’t been possessed by her yet , and the last episode is pretty … well , let ’s just say there ’s a lot of mayhem , and everybody is at risk .
( Laughs ) I mean , you ’re dealing with the Devil here , basically , or somebody who ’s like the Devil .
But Andy ’s great .
In Episode 10 , where we ran around together in the bar in stuff , was one of my favorite episodes .
We had a lot of fun together .
His character …I just love what he does with it .
He just has no fear , and he just goes for it and has fun .
Andy ’s just become a great character , and that ’s another situation where … that ’s something that Chris Bauer brought to that character , the goofy , funny humor .
I do n’t know if there ’s as much humor in Andy in the book .
I ca n’t remember .
But Chris brought a lot to that character , and we have a lot of fun working together .
He ’s a friend of mine from New York .
BE : I ’m absolutely ready for an “ Andy ‘ n ’ Jason ” spin - off .
ST : ( Laughs ) Yeah , they ’re pretty funny together , those two .
They had some funny lines .
BE : So what ’s been your favorite episode this season ?
ST : Well , you know , that tenth episode was really the most fun I ’ve had this season , just working with Chris .
We just had a lot of laughs and a lot of fun .
But , y’know , all of the stuff with Daphne was really great , and the scenes where …there were a few scenes with her , especially that post - coital scene , that I just thought were so beautiful .
Especially what she had to say to me , as far as really loving who you are and accepting yourself , and you ’re not really living life unless you let other people in .
I mean , it was just really beautiful writing , and , unfortunately , it was all to seduce and kill me …
( Laughs ) … but it still goes .
That was really great stuff for me to do .
I really enjoyed that .
BE : I guess you ’ve had to get over any modesty you may have had , given that your character tends to lose his clothes whenever he makes his transformation .
ST : Oh , my gosh , yeah .
You know , the thing is , most of the time when people have to get naked , it ’s for a sex scene or it ’s post - coital , and they ’re in a bedroom and it ’s kind of a closed set .
But with Sam , it always seems to be because he ’s turning back into himself from being an animal , so I ’m always outside .
Like , way out .
Like , out for everybody to see .
There ’s no way you can close the set , really , and it ’s just …it ’s bizarre .
I just feel very vulnerable , standing around naked .
Like , last year , I was running through the woods in Louisiana , and this year , with the fire extinguisher .
So , yeah , you definitely …it ’s , uh , pretty awkward .
( Laughs )
But it ’s kind of funny .
BE : It seems like that would ’ve been one of those things that you could ’ve been blindsided by if you had n’t read the books beforehand .
ST : Well , yeah , but with HBO , of course , before you even sign up , they ’re , like , “ Are you willing to take your clothes off ?
Because this is HBO . ”
And , of course , I ’m , like , “ I ’ll do anything to be on the show . ”
And I ’ve actually done it before .
I ’ve done nudity on stage , believe it or not , so doing it on this show is actually a little bit more modest than being full - frontal on stage , in front of an audience .
I ’m an old pro , basically .
( Laughs )
But it ’s one of those things that inspires you to stay in good shape .
That ’s the toughest part about the nudity .
It ’s the not eating beforehand .
( Laughs )
BE : Do you have any backstage anecdotes from your experiences on “ True Blood ” that can share ?
ST : Oh , golly , there ’s definitely stuff from the last episode , but , unfortunately , I ca n’t reveal them !
( Laughs )
But it ’s a pretty fun set .
Nothing specific comes to mind , but …well , this is just a little trivia thing that you might be interested in , but the scene where I ’m swimming in the lake , that was actually the old “ Gilligan ’s Island ” set .
BE : ( Laughs )
Oh , really ?
On Sam 's chances of seeing Season 3 : " We just have to hope that Sam survives !
I ’ll just have to leave it at that .
But somebody ’s in big trouble in the last episode , I ’ll tell you that .
We ’ll just have to see how things play out , but it ’s gonna be a pretty crazy finale . "
ST : Yeah !
And I was really worried that we were going to go off into the woods , because … I did a TV show once called “ Going to California ” where we actually swam in a bayou with real alligators and stuff , which was the stupidest thing I ’ve ever done .
And I was worried they were going to do that !
But they used that set , and they heated the water so it was really warm , but it was so shallow that I could kneel and be , like , only waist high .
It was only maybe three feet deep .
So we had to pull our legs up , so that we could tread .
We could n’t even just hang our legs down .
You had to get in a weird sitting position with your legs pulled up .
It was really weird .
But I was really happy that the water was so warm .
It was like being in a hot tub .
It was great .
BE : So has it been weird seeing the results of all the marketing money that ’s been thrown behind the show ?
I mean , in particular , L.A. was just plastered with “ True Blood ” ads and billboards .
ST : Yeah , well , you know , what was really unique was that some of the advertisers wanted to use “ True Blood ” in their advertisements .
Like , Harley Davidson and Mini Cooper did ads for their products saying that they ’re for vampires .
So that was really cool .
Yeah , the advertising … they ’ve been pretty innovative with it , especially at the very beginning , when they were just advertising the drink TruBlood .
Which I guess is finally actually coming out !
For awhile , they had posters of us on bus stops , of each individual person .
That was pretty cool .
BE : I understand you ’ve been nominated for a Scream Award for your Breakout Performance on the show .
ST : Yes , I have !
And I ’m very proud of that .
That ’s a very core audience of ours , and I think “ True Blood ” did pretty well .
I think a lot of people got nominated from our ensemble cast , so we ’re psyched .
I mean , that ’s exactly who we want to recognize us , really , ‘ cause they ’re the people who love horror movies and genre shows .
So it ’s great .
BE : “ True Blood ” is really an interesting cross-demographic show .
Vampires traditionally tend to have a real harcore female audience , but this series … I know tons of guys who love it and watch it , too .
ST : Oh , I know !
Yeah , Alan always says , “ The romance gets the women , and the sex and violence gets the men . ”
I think our show is edgy enough that ... well , it definitely appeals to men and women , equally , sure .
BE : Speaking of the sex and violence , has there been any scene during the course of this season that has disconcerted you ?
Not necessarily even one that you were in , because there ’s really been some hardcore stuff this season .
ST : Oh , yeah .
I mean , that heart soufflé was pretty intense , and I know there ’s some stuff coming up in the finale that ’s really … harsh and shocking .
But , yeah , the heart soufflé was pretty hardcore , and also when Jane Bodehouse cut her finger off .
That was pretty hardcore , too .
That whole scene was really weird .
And the guy sitting in the sink … ?
Really creepy .
BE : It ’s been highly disturbing this season .
And I mean that in the best possible way .
ST : I know , I know .
And I know there ’s some other stuff , too , that I ’m not thinking about .
But , yeah , there ’ll be a little gore in the last one , too .
BE : I can believe that .
ST : ( Laughs ) Yeah .
BE : Who ’s your favorite character to play off of that you do n’t get teamed up with enough ?
ST : Well , you know , it would have to be Bill and Jason .
I mean , I just never get to work with those guys .
We ’re all good friends and fond of each other , but …
( Trails off ) I love playing off of Bill , and Jason I love , too , but I ’ve barely gotten to work with him at all , so hopefully I ’ll get to do more with those guys .
BE : And just out of curiosity , could you tell that something was going on between Anna ( Pacquin ) and Stephen ( Moyer ) on the set and off ?
ST : No !
BE : No ?
ST : Absolutely not .
I was completely … well , they ’re so professional .
And , I mean , I was completely surprised when he told me that they had kind of gotten together last year .
Completely surprised .
They hid it so well .
And I ’m so happy for them that they ’re engaged .
That ’s just so exciting for them .
It ’s great .
It must be such a unique experience to be able to work with somebody who you ’re also romantically involved with .
So good for them .
But , no , I could not tell .
I did n’t know anything .
That could be because I ’m just an idiot .
( Laughs ) I do n’t know .
BE : One last thing I wanted to mention about the show is that the soundtrack is really a significant key to its success .
ST : Oh , it ’s just amazing .
It ’s so good .
It ’s so , so good .
BE : Do you have a favorite song that ’s popped up during the course of the show , maybe one that had n’t been familiar with before ?
ST : Yeah , but , y’know , I do n’t even know the names of them .
All the songs that are on the jukebox ( at Merlotte ’s ) and the songs at the end are so great , but , gosh , I ca n’t remember any of their names right now .
There are a bunch last year , though , that I was just flipping over , that I just thought were so great .
BE : I ’ve loved how the episodes have been named after the songs that are playing over the closing credits .
ST : Yeah , exactly .
And … I forget which episode it was , but …oh , it was the song that closed last week ’s episode , where Bill goes to see the Vampire Queen , and I think it was the first time that the music from the scene had transferred into the music of the credits , which was really cool .
That was a really cool scene .
BE : To bring this back to the TCA for a moment , before the panel for “ Eastwick , ” a new series on ABC , while showing footage for the show , they played the theme song for “ True Blood . ”
ST : Are you serious ?
That ’s …I can’t believe that !
BE : I know , right ?
It was , like , “ You ’re doing this in front of an audience full of TV critics ?
That ’s either the ballsiest move I ’ve ever seen , or it ’s the stupidest . ”
ST : Man !
That ’s really , really crazy .
Now , “ Eastwick , ” what is that ?
BE : It ’s a TV version of “ The Witches of Eastwick . ”
ST : Oh , okay .
Well , I guess this is the time of witches and vampires and warlocks , right ?
BE : Exactly .
They ’ve got to strike while the iron is hot , I guess .
Well , I do n’t want to keep you too much longer , but I did want to ask you about a couple of other projects you ’ve done over the years .
ST : Oh , yeah , sure !
BE : When you mentioned swimming with alligators a few minutes ago , I immediately thought of your work on “ Maximum Bob . ”
ST : Oh , yeah !
Oh , man , that was so good .
It was only seven episodes during the summer of ’ 98 , but …it was ahead of its time .
I mean , it was Barry Sonnenfeld , who was a DP for the Coen Brothers ’ movies and , y’know , did “ Men in Black . ”
He ’s awesome .
It was so stylized and fun .
It was great .
BE : When I talked to him last year , he cited it as one of his favorites .
ST : That ’s so great !
Wow , you asked him about “ Maximum Bob ” ?
BE : Well , I asked him about his favorite project that did n’t get the love he thought it deserved , and he immediately cited “ Maximum Bob ” and “ The Tick . ”
ST : Oh , man , yeah .
We had a lot of fun .
Barry ’s a…he ’s a fun guy , and , of course , Will Sanderson was in that , too , who ’s on “ True Blood . ”
It was a really good show , just so quirky and off the wall .
Oh , man , it was fun .
And it was a fun part , too , playing that sort of juvenile delinquent .
I loved that .
Except that it was too hot .
Miami ’s just too hot for me .
BE : And , weirdly , you were also in a movie called “ Wrestling with Alligators . ”
ST : Oh , that ’s right !
With Aleksa Palladino .
That was a good little movie .
BE : A period piece , right ?
ST : Yeah , a period piece , in the ‘ 50s .
We shot that in upstate New York .
Or maybe it was in Long Island .
I ca n’t remember !
But that was when I was , of course , living in New York .
That was a sweet little movie .
I should watch that again .
It ’s been so long .
BE : And then on the other side of things , you were in “ Alien vs. Predator : Requiem . ”
ST : Let me tell you something : that was awesome .
Getting ot work with the Alien was …that kind of blew my mind .
There are three guys that work the Alien , who do it , and it ’s been the same guys since “ Aliens , ” the second movie .
It ’s one guy in the suit , one guy running the electric motor for the mouth , and then one guy doing the tail , and he also puts the goop all over the Alien beforehand .
It was interesting because sometimes the guy who was in the suit could n’t hear “ cut ” because of the motor of the mouth running , but getting eaten by that thing was one of the coolest things I ’ve ever gotten to do .
( Laughs ) I mean , it was the Alien !
It was , like , “ What ? ” It was awesome .
I loved that .
BE : You ’ve also done a bunch of one - off roles in other TV dramas .
Do you have a favorite that stands out ?
ST : Well , you know , I ’ll tell you , I just did a “ Law & Order : Criminal Intent , ” and it was such a good part .
It was based on a story in The New Yorker about this French guy who literally …he was like 28 or 30 years old , and he convinced these people that he was 13 or 14 , and he was in an elementary school .
And it was n’t a sexual thing .
He was just kind of a messed - up guy , and he needed to just take on different personalities .
I had read the story , so when I got the script , it sort of reminded me of that , and I talked to them , and lo and behold , they said , “ Yeah , that was what inspired the story . ”
But it was a great , great part .
That ’s one of my favorite things that I ’ve gotten to do , as far as one - off shows .
I got to work with Vincent D’Onofrio , who ’s an amazing actor , and I got to play this different part .
It ’s fun to play a bad guy .
I love to play bad guys .
BE : And , lastly , to bring it back to “ True Blood , ” can you give me any clue as to where Sam will be come the beginning of Season 3 ?
Or would that give away too much about the end of Season 2 ?
ST : You know , I can ’t .
We just have to hope that Sam survives !
( Laughs ) I ’ll just have to leave it at that .
But somebody ’s in big trouble in the last episode , I ’ll tell you that .
For the people who ’ve seen everything so far , Bill has come to recruit Sam , and we ’ll just have to see how things play out , but …it ’s gonna be a pretty crazy finale .
BE : Okay , man , I think we ’re good .
ST : All right !
Well , hey , man , great talking to you !
BE : Hopefully you ’ll be around next season , so I can see you at the next TCA Awards .
( Laughs ) Absolutely !
Are U.S. Treasuries A Bubble Ready To Pop ?
The standard theory is that the price / cost of risk - free long - term debt is a function of ( a ) the cost of short - term debt plus ( b ) some function of the market 's anticipation of the likely course of inflation or deflation over the term of the debt .
Governments ( the Fed ) can control short - term rate but they are at the mercy of markets to fix long - term rates .
And of course markets are " efficient " , unless of course there is a " bubble " , when ... Err... they are not .
But then US Treasuries cannot be a bubble - who ever heard of such an idea !
What is a bubble ?
A bubble , by definition happens when markets or market participants seriously misprice some class or category of asset , and they have this uncanny ability to pop up and bite you in the backside when you least expect it .
Examples from the past include the South Sea Bubble ( which Sir Isaac Newton invested in ( on a margin ) , and he was financially wiped out ) , the 1929 stock market bubble which Sir Winton Churchill invested in ( on a margin ) and was financially wiped out , more recently there was the S&L and the Dot.com bubble , and if course the house price bubble in which many Americans invested in ( on a margin ) and they , and many banks and bond - holders that provided the margins , were financially wiped out .
It 's not just greedy lunatics that get fooled by bubbles , some very smart and otherwise perfectly decent and sane people have got fooled in the past , and every time they tell themselves , " it 's different this time " .
A bubble in Treasuries ?
Of course there has never been a bubble in long - term Treasuries , so there is nothing to worry about .
I talked to a knowledgeable person who is in " bonds " and got told " there is a good appetite now , and of course in the medium term we might see some pull back ... but nothing to worry your pretty little head about old chap ! "
And yet I can't stop remembering being " honored " to be able to have a moment with the senior analyst of a major - major international real estate company in about September 2008 , talking about Dubai , those were the exact words he used .
Six months later prices had halved .
So I said to Mr. Bond , " Well I 'm talking about something else ... bubbles .
And I know about them , that 's how on 26th February I could say that the S&P would turn as soon as it pierced 675 and would go up to 1,000 without a major reversal "
To which he said , " well if you got that close then you must have been lucky " .
Ca n't win .
So what 's the chance of third - time - " lucky " ?
Bubbles are ultimately unstable which is why they pop .
Often the " pop " is catastrophic , and fast ( http://www.marketoracle.co.uk/Article12165.html).
The key reasons bubbles are created ( no they are not accidents ) are :
Market participants lose sight of the fundamental value of the assets in question , quite often that 's because of a " new " situation , or because they get confused and do n't have access to the right information to make rational investment decisions .
Often this is facilitated or caused by actions of government .
Often credit plays an important part , typically when it is available at a cost less than the inflation in a particular class of asset .
Fundamental value
Now , I 'm going to have to think !
Can I think of any instance in the recent past when " market participants " ( by that I mean the " professionals " ) lost sight of the fundamental value ?
That 's a tough one , hang on I remember a conversation was n't there something to do with housing ?
But then of course that was n't anything major , after all the Chairman Greenspan The Great said that was all just a bit of froth .
It 's coming back ... I remember I had a conversation in 2005 about house prices in USA and UK , and someone told me " there is a good appetite now , of course in the medium term we might see some pull back ... but nothing to worry your pretty little head about old chap ! "
What was new then was securitized debt .
This time what 's " new " is that the financial system had a " near miss " .
That 's new , unless you buy the idea this is a carbon copy of the Great Depression and that by understanding what went wrong then you got a road map to dig out of that hole .
Which sounds a bit like the theory that learning the lessons of the first Great War could help you fight the second one , which was the logic behind the Maginot line .
Another thing that 's " new " , is that there is a huge debate going on amongst the gurus and the market participants about whether to expect inflation or deflation in the near , medium or long term .
In the old days , that conversation was conducted POLITELY in oak paneled rooms over sherry as the great economists of the time mused of such imponderables as " inflation targeting " , and " M " and " V " and " T " and " ABCD " .
Now the debate is starting to look a bit like a catfight .
There are many " schools " all with conflicting positions .
Close your eyes and you might be fooled that the " war of words " was one of those debates between high priests in the Middle Ages about how many angels could stand on the tip of a needle .
The only contribution that I would like to make to that debate is to remark that ( A ) there is clearly not a consensus , so it is possible that at least half of the market is going in the wrong direction ( whatever that ultimately turns out to be ) .
That sounds " confused " to me , and economists even hinting that they might be confused , is new .
( B ) : What if instead of inflation / deflation affecting the bond price , the bond price affects inflation / deflation , like " is the dog wagging the tail or is the tail wagging the dog ?
The “ Government ” has the idea that it is “ in control ” , but is it ?
The Government as a facilitator of anarchy and chaos
Some commentators have argued that the history of Monetarism is about the government lending , or creating conditions for lending money cheaper than the inflation in assets , thereby creating a frenzy of " economic " activity , which creates bubbles , which then burst , bringing you back to Square One .
The fact that gets you to back to square one ( or worse ) is because of the pesky Second Law of Thermodynamics which says that you can't create something from nothing , not that some people do n't get very rich in a bubble ( and some get very poor ) , but it 's just a re-distribution of wealth , and the sum of all the parts is zero , or less ( due to efficiency losses , which in the case of the housing bubble was the " commission " Wall Street creamed off the top ) .
The current US administration believes that a " bit of froth " is a good thing from time to time , so long as you can control it .
Some people think that 's crazy , and the passion surrounding that debate is as intense as the passion surrounding the inflation / deflation debate .
By the way , I had a friend called David .
He was great ; you could n't meet a nicer guy , kind , considerate , funny !
He used to take heroin from time to time , " not much mind " ; just he felt that now and then it was a " good thing " , and he told me , " do n't worry your pretty little head about it , I can control it " .
He 's dead now .
Sometimes you can have too much of a good thing .
Credit :
What 's happening at the moment is that the US Government ( as a whole ) is borrowing money at about 2 % lending that to bankers at less than 1 % then the bankers are buying 30 - Year - Treasuries at 4 % .
In the old days they had the 3 - 6 - 3 rule ( borrow at 3 , lend at 6 and be on the golf course at 3 ) , the US Government is evidently going with the 2 - 1 - 4 rule ; that reminds me of Milo & Milo in Catch 22 ( he who bought eggs for $ 2 and sold them for $ 1 and made a profit ) .
By the way the logic there is the bankers can " earn " their way out of trouble .
I can't understand why they do n't just give them money ; I suppose that 's politics , or perhaps they think that by doing that they can create money out of nothing ?
Easy money bidding up asset values to " earn on the turn " , is a classic cause of bubbles ( " plenty of demand out there old chap " ) , perhaps that 's the " bit of froth " that the government is creating , which of course is a " good thing " .... from time to time .
Big picture :
A lot of people are in debt , all over the world , they would like to get out of debt , but they can't sell the assets they hold at a decent price , and even if they did , they might still not be able to pay their debts .
So what choice do they have ?
Well they need to roll over debt but no one wants to lend to them , so what should that be doing for the 30 - Year Treasury ?
Pushing up the yield ( i.e. the interest people pay ) , and pushing down the price .
But it 's not ; could that be a bubble ?
But do n't worry !
People much smarter than you have got everything under control !
Of course the way to get out of debt is to take on more debt , just like the way to cure a heroin addition is to take more heroin .
That 's why the US Administration ( taken as a whole ) , is piling on more debt , lots of it .
So how much debt we talking about ?
Some people are getting all hot and bothered about the debt that the American Government ( as a whole ) is taking on .
I hate to be a killjoy , but that 's not the half of it , if you think that 's a problem , well consider this , the debt that the WHOLE of America has taken on and that is owed to foreigners is a bigger problem , and whether that debt is increased by individuals borrowing or the state borrowing is just detail .
This is a chart of how much tradable debt ( i.e. bonds ) was issued in USA since 2000 :
It 's not exactly apples for apples , " Private Label " comes from the chart presented by Mark Zandi to the Financial Stability Committee in July which was prepared by Thompson Reuters , and is the total value at face of bonds issued and does not include any roll - overs , the Treasuries is the change in the National Debt and is therefore net :
The first point that I would like to make is that the total " Private Label " generated from 2000 to 2008 was much more ( about $ 17 trillion ) than the total Treasuries ( $ 4.2 trillion ) , i.e. the amount of debt the private sector was piling on was up to five times what the government was piling on , but of course that was n't enough to make a little bell go " ding " in someone 's head .
I have not found reliable data on how much of that was sold to foreigners , but the consensus appears to be about 50 % .
So that 's about $ 10.6 trillion " exported " .
A problem right now seems to be that USA can't get enough debt to keep its shaky bicycle on the road because the " shadow banks " are n't making it any more .
And most of the debt is being found is being used to pay back or somehow conceal old debts .
And the only way America can get debt now appears to be to sell 2 - Year Notes , not 30 - Year Notes ( which would be a more realistic timeframe for paying them back ) .
Perhaps a reason the 2 - Year is in such favor is that the Treasury does n't think it can sell 30 - Year in any quantity , and has thus devised a circuitous route that will keep up " demand " for 30 Year stuff ?
I wonder what 's next ?
Can we expect to see auctions of 1 - Year Notes , then 6 - Months , then 30 - Days ?
Is this the desperation of an addict in search of one last fix ?
And of course , something to look forward to , at some point in the not to distant future Americans are going to find $ 10.6 trillion of Yen , and Yuan , and Euros and Pounds to pay back that debt , or the proportion of it that they did not renege on .
AAA Quality : Made in America With Pride
That $ 10.6 trillion of debt was not counted as an " export " ( because it was supposed to come back ) , but it generated foreign exchange all the same , which more than covered the current account deficit in goods and services that was accumulated over that time ( $ 5.2 trillion ) .
So effectively what was happening was that Americans were mortgaging their houses , and via the kind intermediaries on Wall Street , selling the mortgages to foreigners who paid in Euros , Yuan , Yen , Pounds etc , and then they were using the foreign exchange to buy oil so that they could drive Hummers and also to buy nice toys and gizmos from China .
And they bought lots of stuff , little of which had the capacity for generating revenue in the future with which the ( $ 10.6 trillion ) debt could be paid back , any more than what 's left after you sniffed some of that nice " good thing " from Columbia up your nose , i.e. zero .
That 's a new category of borrowing ; in the old days ( 1 ) you borrowed to finance CAPEX or working capital ( which if you got your sums right had some chance of generating revenue to pay the debt back ) .
Then : ( 2 ) you borrowed to finance current expenditure , which you told yourself " might " have some chance of generating income ( as if that was some sort of working capital ) .
Then : ( ( 3 ) - the new category ) " what the heck " , you borrowed so you could sniff stuff up your nose to tide you over the withdrawal symptoms .
That 's the bottom of the greasy pole .
Is that where USA is right now ?
Looking at that another way :
Setting aside the " Inflationist / Deflationist " arguments for a moment , and also setting aside the notion that the yield on the 30 - Year Treasury is somehow an efficient market that magically and mysteriously takes into account all future inflation / deflation , even when market participants ( or at least their economists ) , can't agree these days on the semantics or the definitions .
Perhaps there is something else that affects the yield on a 30 - Year which depends , not on the infinite wisdom of the market in guiding the decision about how many angels are going to fit on the needle , but on something that happens , in reality , in the real world , right now ?
Perhaps # 1 :
Perhaps there is a link between ( A ) the amount of foreign currency that get changed into dollars every year , compared to ( B ) the amount of dollars that get changed into foreign currency , and ( C ) the 30 - Year Treasury yield ?
I 'm sure there are a multitude of complicated economic and financial theories to explain that , which are easily as complicated as Einstein 's General Theory of Relativity .
The only difference is those theories have never been subjected to rigorous scientific examination , well two things actually , that ; and he fact that they have been used to cause more damage to the world than Einstein 's Theories ever did .
And I 'm sure the Fed has all sorts of complex data , but frankly ( a ) I can't make head or tail of them and ( b ) given past experience I think I prefer to deal with figures that I trust and that have been audited .
Perhaps # 2 :
Perhaps the big story in any case is just those three numbers , if A>B then there would be spare dollars floating around so yields would go down , and if B >
A then it would be the opposite ?
Just a hypothesis , that 's what I want to test .
So how much were A and B over the past few years ?
Well the net of exports less imports is pretty uncontroversial , even the economists do n't argue about whether those are reported correctly or not .
OK so let 's add to those numbers 50 % of the tradable debt " manufactured " every year to get what I call the " Virtual Current Account Balance " ( and just in case there are any " real " economists left in the audience I will give that the acronym VCAB because economists just love acronyms ) .
VCAB is a simple non-controversial number , three well - known numbers added together with only two assumption ( 50 % of the debt was sold abroad ) , and net - net that was the main part of the current account balance .
How about a plot of that against the average 30 - Year Treasury rate since 2000 ?
Now look at that !
What a pretty - pretty " S " curve , actually I 'm not sure if it's an " S " curve or a line , but the point is when VCAB goes up the rate appears to go down , within the range of data being looked at .
OK the " proof of the pudding " is only three points , I suppose I should go back a few years , but big - picture they then had n't invented the really toxic stuff that everyone loved , and in any case I do n't have any clue on how much debt was sold abroad since then .
So on that chart , where is USA right now ?
Err ...see that red dot ?
That 's where it is , and a reason for that is in part because those shadow bank boys seem to have lost the knack of selling " AAA Made In America With Pride " Toxic
Debt to dumb foreigners , like so many oil tankers full of melanin tainted milk ( if they could that red dot would be over to the right ) .
That says something is keeping the 30 - Year Treasury yield unnaturally low right now , it could of course be a bit of this it and could be a bit of that and it could be an angel with a sore toe standing on the tip of a needle .
Trying to find exactly how that works is like trying to get a drug addict to tell you the truth about their habit , do n't even bother .
But my guess is it 's a lot to do with Milo & Milo or do they call them Goldman Sacks these days ?
Whatever it is , it 's unstable .
If this analysis is valid , at some point something has to give , perhaps quite soon no one is going to want to buy a 30 - Year Treasury at 4 % or something yield , they are going to say " No Thanks " I 'll give you 7.5 % .
Then I wonder what the value of the 30 - Years that the Zombies bought at 4.5 % will be worth ?
Of course that 's nothing to worry about since FASB and BIS will let them record them at " face " for the purposes or working out their capital adequacy , the other word for that is a " Stress Test " .
But the way it looks to me , the Greatest And Most Powerful Nation on Earth the one that everyone said was " To Big To Fail " , show signs of running out of cash to feed its habit .
In which case pretty soon no one is going to want to lend it any more to continue with it 's self indulgence , except of course the Fed , thank God for the Fed .
Of course perhaps I 'm being alarmist , perhaps the " team " that created the housing bubble and the credit crunch , finally figured things out , but is it worth taking that chance ?

Fed policy makers make their decisions about interest rates behind closed doors , then communicate those decisions primarily through brief , cryptic statements that analysts busily decode in the days that follow .
But that kind of distance has become impossible in the two years since the American economy plunged into its worst financial crisis since the Great Depression .
These days , Mr. Bernanke and the Fed have been bailing out financial institutions , printing money in unheard - of volumes and stepping in to fill the lending gap left by the crippled capital markets .
Even in better economic times , Mr. Bernanke , who was appointed by President George W. Bush in 2006 , would be under pressure to get out the Fed ’s message : his term as Fed chairman ends at the end of next January , and President Obama will have to decide in the next few months whether to nominate him for another term or replace him with his own choice .
The Fed has never wielded as much power as it does right now , but the very expansion of its mission has exposed it to more second - guessing and more challenges to its political independence than ever before .
“ The Federal Reserve , in collaboration with the giant banks , has created the greatest financial crisis the world has ever seen , ” Representative Ron Paul , Republican of Texas , said at a House hearing last week in which Mr. Bernanke testified about the state of the economy .
Republican lawmakers portray the Fed as the embodiment of heavy - handed big government , and have called for scaling back the central bank ’s regulatory powers .
But liberal Democrats , like Representative Dennis J. Kucinich of Ohio , have accused the Federal Reserve of caving in to demands by banks for huge bailouts , for failing to protect consumers against dangerous financial products and for being too secretive about its emergency rescue programs .
More than 250 lawmakers have signed a bill sponsored by Mr. Paul that would allow the Government Accountability Office to “ audit ” the Fed ’s decisions on monetary policy  a move that Fed officials see as a direct threat to their political independence in carrying out their central mission of setting interest rates .
Last night , the Buccos lost to the Washington Nationals , 8 - 4 .
In the first inning , team savior Andrew McCutchen homered for the fourth time in August , giving him twice as many as anyone else in the young month .
Announcer Greg Brown pointed this fact out later in the game when Cutch came up to bat again .
But while Cutch was approaching the plate , the cameras panned to some fans wearing McCutchen t- shirts and jerseys .
They seemed to be enjoying themselves as Andrew prepared to come up to bat .
At that point , Brown , a fine announcer in his own right , made an unfortunate slip of the tongue .
“ Andrew McCutchen …family , perhaps , in the stands . ”
That sentence might have been fine , had he not added “ perhaps ” in the middle .
If you ’re going to bring up some family members at the game , make sure they ’re actually related to the players .
If you see a couple black guys in McCutchen shirts , that does n’t automatically make them related to the black ballplayer who wears that jersey .
Find if the family members are there , point them out and stand behind your statement .
One tiny word … ” perhaps “ … is enough to make a simple observation carry more weight .
Now , I know Brown is n’t a card carrying member of the KKK or anything , but announcing slip - ups are bound to be caught … even if you ’re currently existing in the black hole that is Nationals - Pirates games .
Survival+ : Structuring Prosperity for Yourself and the Nation
by Charles Hugh Smith
Introduction Since launching my blog www.oftwominds.com in May 2005 , nothing seemed more important than warning readers that the unsustainably leveraged credit - mad global financial system was poised to break down .
Once the system finally crashed in late 2008 , my goal switched to writing a practical guide for not just surviving the coming Great Transformation but prospering : a concept I called Survival + ( Plus ) .
This requires liberating ourselves from failed models of credit expansion , resource depletion , financial looting and a counterfeit prosperity built entirely on debt .
I immediately ran into several great difficulties .
Many others had foreseen the same calamity , and their focus narrowed on individual survival : relocating to a remote / sustainable spot and preparing for societal collapse by stockpiling self - defense and food .
While prudent and practical on a short - term timeline , this response struck me as incomplete on several levels .
Most importantly , stockpiling six months ' supplies would not sustain anyone through a 20 - year Crisis and Transformation ; their own Crisis was simply being delayed a relatively short time .
In other words : " what happens in month seven " ?
Secondly , many " survivalist " proponents focus on individual preparation , as if a single person or household can prosper without a stable , caring community for reciprocal support .
This notion ran counter not just to my own experience but to all of human history .
While I understood the desire to " opt out " and become an Isolationist -- a solution to general turmoil which has roots going back to the dissolution of the Roman Empire and the Warring States era in ancient China -- I felt a more practical , longer - term option to Isolationism should also be presented .
The second great difficulty is that individuals , households and communities exist in larger units : city - states , counties , nations and continents .
Even if nation - states were to break apart , the world would remain tightly interconnected .
Events , weather , shortages and surpluses in distant places would continue to impact us all .
States ( by which I mean all forms of government ) will continue to extend control over resources and wealth .
Trade has been a key component of security and prosperity since the dawn of civilization .
Long before fossil fuels dominated the global economy , land and sea trade in both goods and innovations bound Asia , the Mideast and Europe .
Thus a retreat to isolated islands of self - sufficiency , while understandable and practical on one level , does not align with what history teaches us about prosperity .
Prosperity ultimately depends on stable communities , surplus production and trade .
These essentials have been largely ignored in analyses of the coming Great Transformation .
Thus our individual survival and prosperity are inextricably bound up in larger contexts : we cannot just ignore community , State and trade forces as if they will cease to exist .
Even as they no longer function as they did in the past , it seems wise to influence the larger Transformation rather than view ourselves in an isolation which is ultimately misleading .
That is why I subtitled this book " Structuring Prosperity for Yourself and the Nation . "
To believe that we can prosper individually without regard for the actions of our fellow citizens and the State ( government ) is simply not practical .
Yes , a handful of very rugged people have the experience required to live in the deepest remains of wilderness ; but the wilderness cannot support more than a handful of people , and most of us do not have the requisite skills or ruggedness to survive that splendid isolation .
This , then , is a practical book for the rest of us .
As I organized the book , another great difficulty quickly arose .
I realized that the way a problem is phrased implicitly stakes out the eventual solution .
As a result , the greatest challenge in understanding our plight , both as individuals and communities , is essentially conceptual .
The forces which benefit most from the status quo are pouring all their prodigious resources into framing the " problems " in such a way that the " obvious solutions " leave their own power , influence and wealth intact .
Lest you wonder how this works , recall that all through the initial phase of the financial crisis in 2008 , the mainstream media and standard - issue financial punditry ( SIFP ) blamed the entire crisis on foolish low - income homebuyers who had chosen to finance their purchases with subprime mortgages .
Framed in this way , the " problem " appeared to be caused by credulous citizens in the lower socio-economic levels .
The " solution " was thus to eliminate these people from the pool of potential homebuyers , and auction off their foreclosed homes to worthier buyers .
But subsequent events revealed this framing of the problem to be highly selective : the " problem " extended far beyond feckless subprime borrowers into the top rungs of American Capitalism : the money - center and investment banks , and a politically driven absence of oversight by the very governmental agencies tasked with protecting the public .
The status quo's convenient " framing of the problem " insured that any " solutions " would leave their power , wealth and influence entirely intact ; only the impoverished subprimers would suffer , not those who profited so immensely from the housing / credit bubble .
It was thus clear that a practical analysis of the crisis and coming Transformation requires a deep understanding of how " solutions " are set in the framing of the " problem . "
Indeed , what is " obvious " must be questioned on the deepest levels , for what is " obvious " has two powerful characteristics : it can be managed / manipulated via the mass media , and it directs " solutions " which leave the rentier - financial Power Elite ( what I call the Plutocracy ) intact .
The nature of propaganda in a so - called free State must then be explored in depth as well .
The last great difficulty is also conceptual .
It is relatively straight - forward to present the causes of the coming global crisis : Peak Oil , disintegration of the credit bubble , demographics , etc .
Many books do a fine job of outlining the nature of these interlocking crises .
The books attempting to present solutions typically focus on either individuals ( along the lines of " get rich as the world falls apart " ) or idealized policy " fixes " based on academic understandings of large - scale structures ( articles on G - 20 trade policies , etc ) .
The flaw in both approaches is that neither flows from what I call an integrated understanding of the actual problems .
( Key concepts are italicized when introduced . )
Practical solutions must follow from this integrated understanding .
Without such a comprehensive conceptual framework , then all proposed solutions will be ungrounded and thus dangerously misleading .
Any " solution " which ignores key elements of the problem is doomed to solve nothing .
As in our example of the so - called " subprime crisis , " the " solution " of limiting uncreditworthy borrowers did nothing to address the actual problems : highly profitable and highly fraudulent practices riddling every level of the mortgage / rating / securities industries , perverse incentives that created unprecedented opportunities for windfall exploitation , over - reach and looting , etc .
I cannot claim that reaching such an integrated understanding will be easy .
Many of the concepts presented here may be unfamiliar and thus difficult to grasp at first .
Many are so alien to status quo " explanations " that they may well strike you as the opposite of " obvious . "
But since I have thought about these concepts and forces for years , they seem " obvious " to me .
In the language of our Declaration of Independence : I hold these truths to be self - evident .
So let us begin .
We stand on the threshold of a Great Transformation that will unfold over the next 20 years - - a generation .
The exact turn and sequence of events is unknown , but a clear - eyed appraisal of the forces , trends and cycles already at work will help us , collectively and as individuals , weather the challenges and turn what could be a catastrophe into a positive transformation .
To the status quo understanding of how our world works , this appraisal will be anything but " obvious . "
( Sorting out what is " obvious " is a big part of the analysis which follows . )
A number of other writers have addressed preparing for the Depression which has just begun .
These books are , within their limited scope , practical and useful .
This book aims at a different goal : once we understand the complex forces at work , then we can structure a response on all three levels : household / family , community and nation .
For if there is anything we can confidently predict , it 's that the nation 's crumbling finances will drastically affect every family and every community .
Key concepts in this Introduction : Plutocracy ( rentier - financial Power Elite ) integrated understanding windfall exploitation over - reach
Chapter One : An Overview
A great clash between what we are told is unfolding and what is actually unfolding lies just ahead .
The status quo " Powers That Be " and its mainstream media repeatedly insist that :
We have abundant cheap energy for a long time to come ; Peak Oil is decades away .
We have plenty of time for technological wonders to arise and replace petroleum .
The Social Security and Medicare entitlements promised to all Americans , though totalling some $ 50 trillion in excess of projected tax revenues , will be paid ; all that is needed are modest policy adjustments .
The current financial meltdown was unexpected and could not have been foreseen ; it is a temporary " bad patch " which has already been fixed by government intervention and modest policy / regulatory adjustments .
Environmental issues such as the stripping of the world 's fisheries , dead zones in the Chesapeake Bay , dwindling fresh water acquifers , etc. can all be fixed with modest policy adjustments .
The consumerist culture which has evolved over the past 60 years is a natural and highly successful perfection of capitalism , prosperity and American values ; Americans are the happiest , most prosperous people on the planet .
The fast - growing epidemic of obesity and related chronic diseases in the U.S. are puzzling and worrisome , but we have the finest healthcare system in the world .
Yet all of the above is demonstrably false .
In reality , the decline of abundant cheap oil ( oil under pressure in supergiant fields ) has already begun .
The iron laws of demographics dictate the promised entitlements cannot be paid and that Medicare is only a few short years away from insolvency .
The current financial meltdown was not only easily predictable , it was inevitable , as the consequences of systemic fraud , deception , embezzlement , misrepresentation , collusion , debauchery of credit , exponential expansions of risk , debt and speculative leverage could not be held off forever .
The devolution of American culture and values to a one - dimensional " consumerism is the highest good in the land " was not natural , and rather than produce the perfection of capitalism , it has produced the perfection of crony capitalism , monopoly capital and an ever - expanding State beholden to an Elite which owns or controls the vast majority of the productive assets , financial wealth , income and lawmaking machinery of the U.S.
Rather than being the happiest people on the planet , Americans are visibly unhappy , anxious , depressed , distracted and all too often heavily sedated with powerful psychotropic medications .
This is not to question the positive contributions made by psychiatric medications to those suffering from psychiatric disorders ; but we should question the idea that tens of millions of our citizenry ( including children ) are suffering from serious psychiatric disorders .
We should wonder if the overzealous dispensation of such drugs masks cultural rather than psychiatric disorders , and an unspoken desire to " treat " these cultural disorders in a relatively low - cost fashion by numbing the patients ' awareness of their own alienation , anxiety and unhappiness .
Rather than having the finest healthcare system in the world , we have the worst , most perniciously incentivised system in the industrialized world , a system which consumes a staggering 16 % of the nation 's entire output but which provides little to no healthcare for tens of millions of citizens and which supplies incredibly costly but largely ineffective care to the elderly covered by a fraud - riddled and increasingly unaffordable Medicare .
Up to 40 % of the entire sum spent on healthcare is paper shuffling , fraud and useless / harmful " care . "
Despite this vast outpouring of the nation 's wealth , the health of its citizenry continues to decline in measurable ways ; this vast expenditure has done nothing to stop the astonishing rise in obesity and related chronic diseases , arguably the most pressing public health issue facing the nation .
In effect , the U.S. healthcare system is bankrupting the nation even as it fails to improve the health of the citizenry at large .
It is thus a stupendous failure , creating ever smaller marginal gains with ever greater expenditures for costly tests , drugs and treatments .
Rather than look to an increasingly unhealthy diet and lifestyle , the nation 's " sick - care " system seeks ever more costly " treatments " and pharmaceutical " fixes " for complex chronic diseases which are simply not curable by " magic bullet " drugs .
Contrary to the constantly repeated assurances of The Powers That Be , modest policy and regulatory modifications are not replenishing the nation 's fisheries or ground water , nor is tweaking the parameters of various systems reversing environmental and economic decline .
You may think these assessments are sensationalist , harsh or even offensive .
That is not my intention .
I believe the evidence is overwhelming that all these soothing contentions pressed upon us by the Powers That Be on a daily basis are in fact false .
If this assertion is true , the vast majority of what is " reported " and " consumed " as " news " and " commentary " is essentially propaganda , either conscious or subconscious .
If the status quo 's intellectual justification for their dominance is fundamentally false , then we can anticipate the wholesale destruction of that justification as events undermine all the self - serving propaganda .
As a result , we will have to construct an alternative understanding of our world which aligns far more closely to reality than the current status quo's complacent faith in a decaying , failing system .
If this is true , then we have no time left for distracting little debates about policy tweaks , economic hairsplitting and modest adjustments ; the time such modifications could have any measurable impact are long gone .
We have run out of time for trivializing conversations along ginned - up ideological lines , " I'm a conservative and you 're a liberal " and the mass media 's entertainment - passed - off - as - analysis .
We have also run out of time for the easy distractions of complexity itself , the unspoken idea that things are now too complex to modify in any meaningful way .
Reality , in contrast , has no problem adjusting complexity downward .
If all the fundamental contentions of the Powers That Be are demonstrably false , we are forced to ask why they press them so mightily and persuasively on us .
The answer to this critical question can be found by asking cui bono : to whose benefit ?
Although we are constantly told the system benefits all of us , that it is the very perfection of prosperity , free market capitalism and thus of happiness itself , this is also demonstrably false .
This leads to the conclusion that the entire intellectual structure which supports and enables the U.S. economy , government and culture is nonsense , and those pushing it so mightily and perseverently are doing so out of a highly refined self - interest -- a self - interest which does not magically better the nation or those not fortunate enough to belong to the Elite ( the Plutocracy ) or to its high - caste technocratic workforce .
These are troubling assertions , and they require careful analysis .
Before you decide this is merely sensationalist , please read the following analysis and look into the sourced books .
Compare your own lived experience and intuitions with the mass media 's " happy story " that everything is just fine , minor financial perturbations have been resolved and a consumerist Utopia is still firmly in place .
It is my contention that the global meltdown has exposed the Plutocracy 's over - reach via ever - larger bets , ever - riskier leverage and ever - larger redistributions of global income to its own coffers .
To protect its interests and dominance , it must defend at all costs the intellectual framework which enables its dominance .
Thus there is a whiff of desperation in its campaign to convince the world that this is not at heart a global crisis which threatens to bring down the entire structure but a " normal " if slightly deeper recession which has already been repaired by the usual " fix " of State manipulation of interest rates and money supply .
We must be alert to the concentrated ownership / control of the mass media , and alert to the overwhelming need of the global Elites to reassure their restive , anxious populaces that the structure of Elite dominance and wealth is robust , secure , and in the populace 's self - interest .
We must be alert to the irony that the Elite 's first task is to convince the underclasses that there is no Elite , no Powers That Be and no Plutocracy .
While there is no " membership " card in the Plutocracy , the simple facts of concentrated ownership , influence and income roughly define that class .
Conflicts between various segments of the Elite does not mean there is no Plutocracy -- it only means that greed and over - reach naturally set up some shuffling and pushing to head the line .
In actuality , the structure is not in the populace 's self interest , and it is increasingly insecure , brittle , and vulnerable to decay and / or disruption on numerous levels .
Much of the vulnerability stems not from Elite over - reach but from the fact that we as a species have reached the carrying capacity of the planet in terms of a high - energy consumption dependency on cheap abundant petroleum for food , transport , water , " growth , " etc .
Nonetheless those who control the vast majority of assets , wealth , and tools of persuasion have the most to gain from a continuing belief in the system 's soundness and stability .
Thus their defense of the system which serves their interests above all else will be fierce and unremitting .
The human mind harbors a bias for what I call independent agencies , a bias which finds full flower in conspiracies both real and imagined .
Ancient humans saw an independent agency of fickle gods who punished or rewarded human supplication with drought or rain .
All human groups form loose confederacies , alliances and " secret societies " ( such as cliques in high school ) which outsiders rightly identify as conspiracies formed for the benefit of the members .
This bias to perceive independent agencies has a selective advantage : the ability to discern causal agents and agencies offers substantial advantages over a passive perception of chaos / randomness .
Why bring this up now ?
Only to note that The Plutocracy is not a conspiracy in the formal sense of a membership which gathers like the Bohemian Club or even an informal assemblage such as the Bilderberg Group .
" Membership " is granted solely by great wealth and control of productive assets ; political influence flows from that .
People who control , say , $ 100 million or more ( via family ownership or managerial position ) , tend to meet one another socially or to do business , and while they jockey for advantage within a group like the rest of us , they form a small class of citizens possessing virtually unimpaired political influence .
Thus in describing a Plutocracy I am not positing a semi- formal conspiracy but simply a financial elite which controls some 2/3 of the productive wealth of the U.S.
This is simply a statement of fact .
Their collective self - interest is in maintaining the conceptual , legal and financial systems which enable their continued dominance of wealth and influence .
It is important to note this bias for independent agencies is founded both in our minds and in the real world ; people with similar self - interests naturally band together in self - organizing networks and groups to protect those interests , and since information is power then the inner workings of various self - organizing groups are confidential as part of that self - protection .
Thus when I speak of The Plutocracy I refer not to a formal conspiracy with meetings and officers but to a self - organized Elite based on protecting their ownership of 2/3 of the productive wealth of the nation .
As each acts to protect his / her wealth at the highest reaches of influence ( tax shelters , tax breaks , legislative exclusions , legal rulings , etc. ) then they are also acting to defend their class .
Why would intelligent people consciously or unconsciously defend and support a conceptual system which so heavily favors an Elite over the common good ?
Certainly self - interest plays a major role .
If you are reporting events and trends which undermine your employers ' wealth and power , you may well conclude that favoring the status quo in all matters will protect your career , income and status far more effectively than announcing the Emperor has no clothes .
As a free - lance writer in the mainstream media , I witnessed how such mechanisms work in the real world .
Media organizations depend on large advertisers for their income , and even though " editorial " ( news and analysis ) is separated from " advertising / marketing , " everyone is aware that negative reporting could influence income and thus eventually detract from each individual 's ability to pay their kid 's tuition , make the car payment , etc .
Thus stories which reflect poorly on major advertisers like realtors and builders are not killed outright -- they are merely strangled by demands for more evidence , more documentation , etc. , or watered down in the name of " fairness " and placed in little - seen areas of the media outlet 's offerings .
In other cases , otherwise independent people have never encountered a serious critique of the status quo's conceptual foundation and thus they believe that conceptual understanding of the world is " obvious . "
Without a skeptical accounting of cui bono ( to whose benefit ? ) then what is " obvious " will naturally tend to defend and support that status quo which has labored to construct and defend an " obviousness " which protects its own wealth , ownership and influence .
As its own interests diverge from those of the culture and economy at large , the Plutocracy has an irresistable incentive to foster the illusion that policies which benefit the Elites also benefit the middle class .
Thus while the Plutocracy and its mass - media minions trumpet the benefits of the free market , these same Elites work with unremitting zeal to exempt themselves and their State factotums from these very same free market forces .
Lastly , the status quo understanding of the world is that any problem is inherently " fixable " with minor policy tweaks .
Thus even as the global financial pyramid of highly leveraged bets and debts unravels , the status quo response is bureaucratic shuffling of oversight duties , minor tweaking of regulatory rules trumpeted as " major fixes " and behind the scenes , trillion - dollar bailouts of the Plutocracy funded by the non-Elite taxpayers .
When the non-Elite citizen comes to understand this , a new mechanism takes hold which I call when belief in the system fades .
This is how empires fall : complacency joins hands with self - aggrandizement .
There are four other subtle processes at work in the dissolution / erosion of the system 's intellectual foundation :
1 . As we shall see in the following chapters , Elites and underclass alike respond to the visible crumbling of the empire with a sublime complacency grounded in vague appeals to some mythical past spirit which will magically arise to enthuse a torpid , self - absorbed Elite and populace .
In the U.S. , appeals are made to " the can - do spirit " which powered America 's past confidence and resolve .
Unfortunately for both the Elite and the underclass ( both of whom depend on State largesse and a vibrant middle class paying high taxes ) , rousing but ultimately empty appeals are no substitute for difficult choices , trade - offs and sacrifices .
2 . Even as interconnected crises afflict the empire , the Elite moves deeper into an increasingly visible self - aggrandizement marked by pervasive over - reaching .
Having mastered its influence over the State , the Plutocracy finds few limits or obstacles to its over - reach .
This over - reach has the characteristics of a positive feedback loop : the more wealth the Elite controls , the greater its influence , which then enables even more wealth acquisition and ever greater influence , and so on .
3 . As a result , the interests of the Plutocracy and thus the State diverge from the common interests of the citizenry as a whole .
This widening structural imbalance of power creates a profound cynicism and political disunity which cripples any attempt at structural solutions .
Given that any real solution would reduce the Plutocracy and State 's share of the national income , both the Plutocracy and the State ( including all those dependent on its various fiefdoms ) resist all structural change , preferring stagnation and eventual collapse to any reduction in their income and power .
One of the single most powerful mechanisms at play is windfall exploitation .
Windfalls in Nature are rare , and thus all organisms are selected to exploit them as fully as possible -- gorging , to the speak , on the newfound riches .
The Plutocracy 's influence enables it to suppress or weaken various counterforces ( such as regulatory systems ) and thus open up windfalls designed to be exploited by the Elites .
Having dispensed with troublesome barriers between finance and banking and nettlesome limitations on securities ratings and off - balance sheet assets , investment bankers opened up stupendous windfalls to be exploited .
A second , related mechanism is over - reach .
As barriers to Plutocratic expansion fall and its share of national income rises , then a positive feedback loop forms : the more the Plutocracy expands , the greater the profits , which then fuels greater political influence , and so on .
At a critical ( and largely invisible ) juncture the Plutocracy inevitably over - reaches .
Over - reach takes many forms ; it might be an unparalleled expansion into highly risky derivatives , or a domestic Plutocracy reaching into international speculations .
The key point is that over - reach pushes the Plutocracy 's financial speculations beyond a level of known , controllable risk into uncharted territory , a territory which promises stupendous profits along with equally stupendous but often obscured risk .
Over - reach inevitably pushes a stable system into instability .
Once the Plutocracy 's income , power and influence are threatened by the rising instability caused by over - reach , then the Elite resorts to propaganda , simulacrum and other mechanisms to mask the structural instability from the populace .
The hope is that the system which so greatly benefits the Plutocracy can be restored to health , but the mechanisms of " recovery " are essentially inauthentic : simulacrums of reform , propagandistic manipulations of financial and economic data to mask the structural instability , and outright fraud / looting of State resources ( bailouts , loans , etc. ) -- that is , publicly - funded exemptions from risk and free market forces that would otherwise require the Plutocracy to absorb the catastrophic consequences of its over - reaching leveraged gambles .
This failure to address the underlying cause -- systemic over - reach and Plutocratic domination of the economy and political system -- insures the instability will only worsen .
As ever - more frantic attempts to protect the interests of the Plutocracy fail , then another feedback loop forms : the more sham reforms and State bailouts fail to restore stability , the more desperate and transparent the Plutocracy 's attempts to retain power .
It is worth recalling that the average compensation for the 10 top hedge fund managers during the go - go years of the 2000s was $ 600 million each .
That is not a typo .
This is an excellent ( if extreme ) example of over - reach and the resulting windfall exploitation .
As it enriches itself via quasi - protected , semi-legal or simply officially sanctioned looting , fraud , deception , embezzlement , collusion , " sweetheart " State contracts , tax avoidance , environmental loopholes and a hundred other mechanisms of over - reach and windfall exploitation , the Elite inadvertently provides the lower classes with a compelling example of increasing wealth via fraud and manipulation rather than production .
Both the high - caste technocrats ( who keep the State and economy running smoothly for their Plutocratic overlords ) and the underclass sense their shares of the national income and wealth are diminishing as the Plutocracy redistributes both to their own pockets , and quite naturally they seek some way to maintain or grow their own declining purchasing power / wealth .
As they watch the Plutocrats in action , they learn the most effective ways to increase one 's share of the income / wealth are looting ( " gaming the system " of pensions , benefits , State entitlements , etc. ) , deception , fraud and embezzlement ( accounting trickery , collusion , sweetheart contracts , etc. ) and influence - peddling , known in the Third World as corruption , baksheesh , etc .
As the middle class increasingly runs afoul of the byzantine , Kafkesque regulations imposed by an ever - expanding State , they find that financial leverage and legerdemain is far more lucrative than actually producing goods and services .
( Unsurprisingly , the Plutocracy finds ways to gain exemptions , loopholes and special dispensations which greatly reduce the reach of troublesome regulations and taxes . )
As the middle class abandons thrift and production for financial speculation and highly leveraged debt ( following the example of their Plutocratic overlords ) , tax revenues soar as leveraged speculation pyramids into bubbles , enabling vast expansions of a State which is inherently seeking constant expansion of its income and powers .
When these financial bubbles eventually deflate , then tax revenues plummet , as productive work and investment have declined .
Why bother working hard when the big , easy money is made via leveraged speculation ?
Only fools would tolerate all the regulatory costs and high taxes imposed on producing goods and services ; far easier to speculate in bubbling assets like housing , stocks , energy , etc .
The State responds to this drop in tax revenues by raising taxes on the remaining productive middle class , creating a positive feedback loop which reinforces the incentives to either drop out , move to speculation or game the system .
Though heavily marginalized , the underclass also copies the Plutocrats ' lead by gaming whatever entitlements the State offers to buy the underclasses ' silence , passivity and compliance .
Thus petty corruption and fraud increases in all State entitlement programs as every sector of society seeks to suck off the maximum benefits while contributing the least possible to the public coffers .
Thus does a nation or empire built on the sacrifices and communal spirit of its citizenry degrade into a doomed culture of self - aggrandizement in which sacrifice is for suckers and looting , manipulation , fraud , embezzlement , exploitation of position / influence , debauchery of credit , maximization of leverage and the pursuit of speculative riches are the order of the day from the Plutocracy on down through the technocratic upper caste to the underclass .
4 . In a society with what we might term an adult understanding of the world , it is understood that difficult trade - offs are a necessary part of life .
One cannot pursue every path at once , acquire every desired object at once or learn every skill at once .
Priorities must be established via vigorous , open - minded debate ( either within oneself for one 's own decisions or within the nation - State for larger issues ) and a painful triage laid down in which some wants are set aside in favor of actual needs .
Broadly speaking , this is the result of a cost - benefit analysis .
Items with increasingly higher marginal costs and increasingly lower marginal returns ( a topic covered later ) are sacrificed in favor of projects with low costs and high returns .
This is , after all , mere common sense .
This painful " adult " process has been replaced in the U.S. by a permanent adolescence in which difficult trade - offs have been banished by stupendous borrowing .
Infantile tantrums and various states of psychological denial have crowded out open - minded discussion ; every want has been funded by breathtakingly massive borrowing by the State , private enterprise and households alike .
A pernicious , largely unexamined system of laws creates tremendous incentives for unnecessary actions designed to ward off lawsuits , feeding vast armies of high - caste technocratic parasites who produce nothing in the way of wealth - producing goods and services even as they burden the remaining productive sector with make - work rules and costly strategies to avoid potentially ruinous lawsuits .
In true Orwellian fashion , much of this parasitism is described by its practitioners as protecting the " little guy " from the oppressive Elite and State .
But as the Plutocracy and State increase their share of the national wealth at the expense of the citizenry , this claim rings increasingly hollow .
Thus we have seniors covered by Medicare receiving multiple costly ( and often useless ) tests designed less to identify the active causes of disease than to shield the practioners from lawsuits and to enrich those administering the tests .
Meanwhile , millions of non-elderly citizens cannot obtain even a single test as they lack the benefits provided to the upper - caste technocrats in the State and upper tiers of the corporate economy .
Rather than face the impossibility of funding such a morally and fiscally bankrupt system of parasitism and profiteering , we as a nation have simply borrowed trillions of dollars to stave off any painful prioritizing or trade - offs .
Very few weapons systems are ever cancelled for the same reasons ; the profiteering by a few enterprises and the contributions they make to lawmakers insure that every weapons system will receive funding , even if that requires borrowing gargantuan sums year after year .
This evasion of hard choices ( and free market forces ) via endlessly rising debt will eventually bring down the nation 's currency and its debt - ridden State .
The irony is that this seemingly care - free self - indulgent adolescent avoidance of cost - benefit analysis guarantees systemic collapse .
Let 's begin our search for an integrated understanding with a look at how over - reach , windfall exploitation and the divergence of Elite / State and middle - class interests illuminate the disintegration of post - World War II America into the present Depression .
1 . The great postwar income convergence ( i.e the rise of the great middle class , the reduction of poverty and the relative reduction of the Plutocracy 's share of national income ) reverses in the early 1970s as the " true prosperity " of the postwar era ends and is replaced by income flowing increasingly to the top as stagflation , globalization and the decline of the dollar gut the purchasing power of the middle class .
2 . The rising productivity of the 50s and 60s slips to the flatline through the 70s and early 80s , only picking up again as computer software and hardware revolutionize the back office , sales , manufacturing , just - in - time shipping / production , etc.
3 . Concurrent with this gradual return to increasing productivity is the rise of finance as the key profit - center of corporate America .
As income skews ever more heavily to the top 1%/5 % , then capital ( productive assets ) become ever more heavily concentrated in the hands of the rentier - financial Plutocracy .
The top 1 % now owns some 2/3 of the nation 's entire productive wealth .
4 . As profits rise ( from rising productivity ) then the profits flow not to wages ( which remain flat to down 1975 - 2009 for all but the top 10 % upper - caste professional class ) but to those who own the capital .
5 . As the middle class experiences a decline in their income and purchasing power ( for reasons cited above : declining dollar , rising income disparity , and wages falling due to global wage arbitrage ) then they turn more and more to borrowing and ever greater debt to fund what they have been brainwashed by the media to believe is " the American dream " of imported luxury goods , bloated homes , vacuous cruises , etc .
The only other mechanism available to the middle class to increase household income is for Mom / Aunt / Grandmom to enter the workforce , which she does in the tens of millions , with sociological consequences which are still unfolding .
6 . This advert / media - driven desire to borrow to fund the " good life " is hugely profitable to the money - center and investment banks , which expand rapidly into mortgage securitization , derivatives and consumer credit to the point that they come to dominate corporate profits .
7 . The financial Plutocracy , observing that actually producing goods is not very profitable unless you can fix prices as per ADM ( Archer Daniels Midland ) or gain government subsidies and tax giveaways ( oil lease depreciation , etc. ) sinks its capital into the FIRE economy ( finance , insurance and real estate ) , eschewing real - world investments as comparatively unprofitable .
Though rarely noted , this is a longstanding trait of capitalism stretching back to 1400 - era Venice .
When trade became less profitable than mainland farmimg , the Venetian Elite stopped funding trade and bought farms on the mainland .
As a side effect , Venice ceased to be a military and trading power .
But the Elite remained immensely wealthy .
8 . As the tech bubble expands , middle - class investors see the Plutocracy ( those with enough capital to qualify as angel investors and vulture , oops , I mean venture capitalists ) reaping huge gains , and they enter the dot - com stock bubble buildup with a vengeance .
9 . In a happy accident , the Soviet Empire collapses just as productivity begins its computer - fueled rise in the U.S.
In a so - called Unipolar World in which U.S. military , political and financial influence is unrivaled , non-U.S. investors seek the relative safety and high returns ( based on appreciation of the dollar ) of U.S. financial instruments .
10 .
The dot - com bubble implodes in a speculative meltdown , and retail investors ( a.k.a. the middle class 401K investors ) are devastated .
The ephemeral wealth they once possessed , however briefly , fuels their speculative desire to get into the next get - rich - quick game , which just so happens to be " something everyone understands : " real estate and housing .
11 . Having exhausted the dot - com play , Plutocratic capital is seeking a new high - profit home .
The miracles of derivatives ( CDOs , credit default swaps , etc. ) and securitized debt ( mortgage tranches , etc. ) open up vast new opportunities for leverage , off - balance sheet shenanigans and outright fraud / debauchery of credit .
As chip wafer plants disappear from Silicon Valley ( too dirty , too costly , etc. ) then they 're replaced with paper : mortgage - backed securities .
( Over - reach and windfall exploitation writ large . )
12 . Sniffing gold in them thar exurban hills , the under - capitalized and over - indebted U.S. working class and middle class reach for the chalice of easy - money gold : leveraged real estate .
( Over - reach and windfall exploitation writ small . )
13 .
With the Federal financial regulatory agencies in a Republican / Democrat - enforced somnambulance , the coast is clear for brigands , shysters , fraudsters , con artists , liars , cheats , and assorted riff - raff in the realty , mortgage and appraisal businesses , who all feed the ravenous maw of the money - center banks ' apparently limitless appetite for real estate assets to securitize and leverage in exotic and stupendously profitable ways .
14 .
For a wonderful five years circa 2001 - 2006 , the game is afoot and no - down - payment Jill and $ 100 million bonus Jack are immensely enriched .
Meanwhile , the underlying real economy is becoming ever more imbalanced and ever more fragile as real production and real productivity plummet as everyone rushes to the speculative riches of exurban McMansions and malls .
15 .
Elite and middle - class interests seem to converge during this speculative mania : everyone is benefitting from the real estate bubble except the poor , who are bought off with minimal social welfare programs and endless entertainment ( via TV ) then safely ignored , as they do n't vote or spend .
But this convergence was illusory ; while the Plutocracy and State functionaries benefitted ( via stupendous capital gains for the former and vastly richer pension promises for the latter ) , the private - sector middle class is in essence the bag - holder : when the newfound ' wealth " in housing and stock market gains vanish , it is the middle class wealth which is destroyed en masse .
16 .
This last best speculative leveraged credit bubble pops ( alas , exponential expansion of credit cannot go on forever ) , gutting the stock market which had grown utterly dependent on leverage , debt , gamed / fraudulent accounting and asset bubbles for its rising profits .
17 .
Doubly devastated by the implosion of housing and their stock investments ( mostly in 401 K and IRA retirement funds ) , the middle class faces the terrible consequences of its 26 - year stupor of ever - rising debt and leverage .
Alas , the Emperor 's clothes are revealed as remarkably transparent .
18 . Having borrowed and squandered trillions of dollars since 1981 on unaffordable entitlements , military misadventures and assorted bridges - to - nowhere pork spending , the Federal government ( The Fed and the Treasury ) finds that its ability to borrow its way out of its current debt hole somewhat annoyingly limited .
The rest of the world has finally caught on to the con , and Chinese university students are openly mocking Treasury Secretary Geithner 's Orwellian claim of " we support a strong dollar . "
The rest of the world shuns Treasury debt and works to create an alternative reserve currency , shutting down the " dollar con " ( we take your tangible goods and give you paper in return . )
19 .
With the global media concentrated in a scant few corporate hands ( less than 10 ) , this pulling away of the curtain is deleted / excised from media coverage in a ruthless campaign of pure propaganda .
20 .
As the wheels fall off the U.S. economy and the bubbles cannot be re-inflated , fruitless attempts at holding back the tide with incantations ( stop , tide , I speak for the U.S. Treasury ! ) and loopy sand castles ( the bottom is in , buy now ! ) abound .
Unresponsive to propaganda , the real world grinds down into a global Depression without visible end .
If we do nothing , we will be swept along with the Great Descent .
Alternatively , if we want to prosper , then we must first gain an integrated understanding of all the interlocking crises we face .
New key concepts in Chapter One : cui bono ( to whose benefit ? ) independent agencies self - organizing networks and groups high - caste , upper - caste ( technocrat / government employee class ) when belief in the system fades simulacrum
Chapter Two : Contexts and Causes
Any guide claiming to be practical must first present all the contexts and causes of the interlocking challenges we now face .
Without such an integrated understanding , all response planning is like building a house on shifting sand .
If we are indeed entering a multi- decade Great Transformation , then as prudent as it is to stockpile a few months of food and supplies , that will obviously not get us through the Transformation , either as individuals or as communities .
We need a thoroughly integrated understanding before we can fashion a response that will make the Transformation a positive one .
Our goal is a sustainable , productive economy and a full appreciation of the fundamental rights to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
I know it is tempting to skip ahead to the list of proposed responses , but they wo n't make sense unless we ground ourselves in the contexts of our planet , era , society and economy .
First , we must identify the fundamental contexts ; second , critique the status - quo understanding of the " problems " and " solutions , " and then third , present solutions which flow directly from our critique .
Our goal is a critique so incisive that the solutions become " obvious , " that is , they are implicit in the critique itself .
Not all critiques manage this ; the grandfather of cul - de- sac critiques was Marx , whose profound critique of capitalism did not produce any coherent alternative system .
It is also important to understand that every " solution " benefits someone , and the key to establishing that " solution " is to frame the " problem " in such a manner that the self - serving " solution " becomes essentially inevitable .
This is why we constantly ask : cui bono , to whose benefit ? , and why we take such care in analyzing how " problems " are being framed by the status quo .
It is my thesis that the standard ( status quo ) understanding of our " problems " is heavily promoted precisely because it benefits an elite at the top of the income / asset pyramid which I call the Plutocracy .
This carefully designed and marketed understanding of the " problem " is presented in ways which can only be described as artful propaganda .
The chief goal of this relentless marketing is to convince you that the " solutions " being presented are in your self - interest ; that is , that they will benefit the entire nation ( if not the entire planet , too ) , including you .
The possibility that these " solutions " exclusively serve the interests of a small Elite is rarely considered , for the obvious reason that the question itself threatens the entire understanding of what constitutes our " problems " and the Elite 's " solutions . "
A key feature of the current era of interlocking crises is that the interests of the Plutocracy are increasingly diverging from the interests of the society as a whole .
This divergence must be masked by simulacra and propaganda , lest the citizenry become aware of the widening split and start demanding that the Plutocracy and the State relinquish some of their ever - growing share of the national income .
By way of example of such divergence , consider globalization as a catch - phrase .
We are constantly bombarded with shrill warnings that any limits on globalization will cause a worldwide Depression akin to the 1930s .
Yet this is disengenuous for a number of reasons .
To the degree that trade is globalization , then the world has been globalized for thousands of years ; Imperial Rome , India and China were trading partners .
But " globalization " covers not just wealth - creating trade but also the most one - sided exploitation of materials and labor .
The one catch - phrase conveniently covers both beneficial commerce of the sort which has gone on for thousands of years and exploitive looting of local resources by global forces .
So when hardwood forests are leveled and the seas poisoned , do the local people really benefit as much as promoters of " globalization " insist ?
Do all the workers displaced -- not just in advanced industrial economies but in Africa as well - - really benefit ?
Or is the entire intellectual framework of " globalization " essentially a front to provide cover for the enrichment of the few at the expense of the many ?
The intellectual framework which supports the Elite 's dominance and makes it apparently " natural " or " beneficial " is the Plutocracy 's key defense ; and the limits of human language and thought make it relatively easy to undermine reasoned skepticism .
Thus a defense of " capitalism " turns out not to be an appeal for open markets but the exact opposite , an enabling of crony capitalism .
The defense of globalization is not a promotion of the exchange - of - surplus - production that characterized trade for millennia but of a targeted grab - and - run exploitation of vulnerable resources and peoples .
Regulations to curb the Plutocracy are undermined by the Plutocracy pursuading the State that " these are the regulations we want , " that is , a simulacrum of regulation that imposes virtually no limits on Elites but effectively strangles the middle class and keeps it " in its place . "
Given the enormous benefits to be gained by this relentless obfuscation , mystification and superficially appealing framing of contexts and problems , we must prepare ourselves for a difficult analysis .
Our first step is to ask cui bono , to whose benefit ?
Our second step is to tease apart the intellectual defenses of over - reach and income redistribution , and consider how the status quo dismisses our actual " problems " as mere bumps in the technocratically maintained road to consumerist Nirvana , i.e. " prosperity . "
One often effective technique deployed to quell questions about Elites ' dominance or self - interest is reduction : that is , reduce the situation to " us versus them " or an " all or nothing " conflict , or frame it as an extension of a current situation which can be addressed by modest tweaks of current policies .
Thus Peak
Oil is not a problem as we have 400 years of coal , etc .
Those in charge of the machinery have a huge stake in technocratic " solutions " which leave power , profit and consumption structures firmly in place .
Identity itself can be reduced ; thus a once - active citizenry is reduced to " consumers . "
As long as " consumers " benefit in any way , then what might be lost to workers , voters , citizens , etc. can be cast aside as meaningless .
Since profits are made by selling something to consumers , it 's extremely handy for all other roles and identities to be extinguished , diminished or marginalized .
The key point here is that dominance flows directly from an intellectual framework which constructs and justifies that dominance as natural and beneficial to all believers .
In this sense consumerism is in effect the de facto state religion of the U.S.A. , and it directly benefits the Elites who own or control the vast majority of the nation 's financial wealth , income , law - making machinery and productive assets .
The second point is that it is impossible to make a clear - eyed assessment of the actual problems and challenges we face when our understanding of those realities is constantly being massaged , manipulated and " framed " out of existence by an elite - dominated media .
( Most of the world 's broadcast , Internet and print media is controlled by a few global companies . )
It is important to understand that the low - level conflict , confusion and anxiety created by the media ( blatantly rabble - rousing entertainment such as Rush Limbaugh being passed off as political commentary , for instance ) are directly in the interests of the Plutocracy .
Anything which undermines critical thinking or a sustained , coherent understanding of the Plutocracy 's over - reach , redistribution of national income in their own favor and the inherent injustice and brittleness of the system which enables and supports their dominance works to the advantage of the Elites .
The third point is that many people who consider themselves smart realists nonetheless end up defending an oppressive and manipulative status quo because they have been persuaded by their salary and other benefits ( such as enhanced personal status - - ooh , my own Blackberry ! ) to defend a self - serving Elite - - or more precisely , the intellectual framework which enables , supports and justifies the Elites ' dominance .
This leads to the fourth point , which is the Elites ' have already won the key battle once their high - caste technocratic " army " of academics , managers , majors and captains , et al. identify this intellectual framework as being in their own self - interest .
This " army " of bureaucrats and technocrats forms an upper " caste " which defends and enforces the Elites ' dominance over the rest of the citizenry .
Even as the economy slips into a Plantation - like structure populated by debt - serfs laboring under the illusion they are free spirits pursuing their own self - interest , the upper caste bureaucrats and technocrats labor to maintain the facade via the distraction of " entertainment , " the " staging " of " news " and the dispensation of " justice " even as " theft by other means " ( looting , embezzlement , fraud , collusion , etc. ) is the modus operandi of an unaccountable Plutocracy .
As on a Plantation , the power and wealth owned by a small Elite indentures the majority of wage earners via the mechanism of crushing debt ( debt- serfdom ) .
Debt - serfs are managed and policed by a managerial and technocratic caste of overseers ( " lunas " in the terminology of the Hawaiian plantations ) .
The fifth point is that this process of persuasion / gaining compliance is not a conspiracy ; it is a complex mixture of conscious and subconscious realignments of incentives and disencentives to maximize attractive risk - return opportunities ( i.e. windfall exploitation and exemptions from market forces ) for the Plutocracy and its upper - caste workforce .
Thus the incentives for public employees to game the system to boost their retirement pay , effectively looting the public treasury in the process , are high while the penalties , thanks in part to union protection , are minimal to nonexistent .
In a similar way , the chicken farm which dumps its waste directly into the bay has a large incentive ( profits ) to avoid regulations which would require treatment of its vast waste .
If it only costs $ 1 million in campaign donations to persuade lawmakers to exempt the farm from environmental regulations while the treatment plant would cost $ 10 million and crimp profits , the cost - benefit analysis is clear : buy the legislative loopholes and continue killing the bay .
With elections becoming ever costlier , the lawmakers have incentives to garner large contributions from enterprises who need " to present our perspective . "
It is n't corruption per se , simply the " rational response " to incentives and cost - benefit ratios embedded in the very structure of the system .
Once the entire system is riddled with gamesmanship , looting , special loopholes and exemptions for the Elite and secret dispensation of public funds , then belief in the supporting intellectual framework and the fairness of the system fades .
The middle class outside the " caste " of State technocrats is squeezed by Plutocratic and State over - reach ; as they drop out then the taxes they paid to support the ever - growing State decline , eventually leading to the State 's insolvency .
The sixth point is that empires and States collapse when the costs far outweigh the marginal gains ; in effect the cost of maintaining the over - reaching State and Plutocracy far exceeds the increasingly marginal benefits provided by the State and " belief in the system . "
Marginal benefits are low , marginal costs are high .
One example of this is medicinal .
Antibiotics provide enormous benefits for low marginal costs .
In contrast to this tremendous leverage -- low costs produce enormous gains -- modern pharmaceuticals are often staggeringly costly even as their benefits are minimal , Adding a costly medication to a senior 's already long list of drugs is extremely costly ( high marginal costs ) even as it offers scant or even negative benefits ( low marginal benefit ) .
The seventh point is that structures ( both political and intellectual ) which once made sense are extended to absurdity / non - sense as the State and Plutocracy over - reach ( over - borrow , over - leverage , take increasingly large gambles / risks to sustain the status quo , increase taxation and looting , etc. )
Thus regulatory systems which once controlled the Elites ' excesses now smother the middle class while the Plutocracy operates beyond any accountability .
The eighth point is that a terribly ironic mechanism gathers force : since free markets are inherently risky ( that is , ontologically based on risk and return and shifting supply and demand ) , the Plutocracy and State functionaries / parasites both have compelling incentives to escape exposure to market forces via exemptions .
Thus State functionaries buy political support for public - sector wages which are two or three times higher than market wages , and healthcare / pension benefits which are unmatched by private enterprise .
Parasitic firms such as defense and healthcare contractors gain " guaranteed contracts " or other exemptions from market forces , while the Plutocracy gains exemptions via public guarantees ( backstops , bailouts and low - cost loans ) of private bets , tax exemptions , etc .
The irony is that neoliberal Capitalism supposedly reveres free markets : but that is mere propaganda .
A simulacrum of free markets is erected for middle class consumption but behind the veils of obscure tax laws , sweetheart deals and the like , the Plutocracy and State functionaries both avoid any exposure to actual market forces which might expose them to risk or limit their share of the national income .
The ninth point is that reality does not respect the intellectual constructs of the Elite ( let 's call this dominant ideology Neoliberal Capitalist Democracy for want of a more accurate term ) .
As a result , as reality increasingly conflicts with this understanding of " how our world works , " then that intellectual framework must increasingly substitute carefully designed simulacrum for authentic structures ( for example , elections in which 98 % of all incumbents win re-election ) and work to derealize any direct experience which runs counter to the Plutocracy 's narrative .
This process of bridging the widening gap between what we experience and what we 're being told we should be experiencing via the substitution of simulacrum for authentic structures is central to this entire analysis .
Why are the State and the Plutocracy ( two sides of the same coin ) substituting simulacrum for authentic structures and truthful accounts ?
Let 's answer by asking : what would a truthful accounting of cui bono -- to whose benefit ?-- reveal ?
A truthful accounting would reveal that the entire status quo system benefits the rentier - financial Plutocracy and the high - caste class of State employees and corporate technocrats at the expense of the rest of us : the 99 % who do not own 2/3 of the productive assets of the nation and the 75 % who do not belong to the State / technocrat upper - caste which serves and enforces the system for its own self - aggrandizement .
In sum : a truthful accounting of cui bono would result in the exposure of the over - reach , exploitation , deception , fraud , mismanagement , malinvestment , manipulation and self - aggrandizement of the Plutocracy and its high - caste State / corporate technocracy ( two " masters , " one system ) .
A truthful accounting would result in the shattering of the illusion that belonging to and supporting the status quo is in your self - interest .
Maintaining this illusion is the key to maintaining the Plutocracy and the State 's share of the national income .
This explains why the Plutocracy and the State ( two sides of one coin ) are obsessed with creating simulacrum structures and narratives designed to lull the citizenry into the comforting illusion that they are the beneficiaries of : -- democracy ( when 98 % of incumbents win re-election , can that be authentic democracy ? )
-- a free press ( when a handful of corporations own the vast majority of the print / broadcast / radio / web media and the State manipulates statistics without media challenge , can that be an authentic " free press " ? )
-- higher education ( a factory for producing high - caste overseers / enforcers for the State / Plutocracy Plantation )
-- healthcare ( a quarter of the citizenry have no healthcare , another quarter have sham " coverage " )
-- " ownership " ( of debt and rapidly declining collateral -- the perfect setup for debt - serfdom )
-- low - tax ( low tax for the Plutocracy and unproductive class , high tax for the dwindling productive class ) " free enterprise " ( crony Capitalism of the most refined order ) .
To maintain their share of the dwindling national income , it is essential that the Plutocracy and State mask the devolution and insolvency of the State .
The primary prop of non-elite belief in the system is the faith that the Savior State will fund everyone 's retirement , healthcare and security as promised - - a promise which can not be fulfilled .
( A Savior State promises to save everyone from personal responsibility via entitlements funded by demographic and financial fraud . )
As a result of this pervasive substitution of simulacrum structures and narratives / explanations , truthfulness evaporates , replaced by deception and propaganda .
Transparency is replaced by obscurity and staged entertainments are presented as " news " or " democracy in action . "
Facts are replaced by carefully massaged statistics ; accounting is replaced by trickery .
Common purpose is replaced by self - aggrandizement and game - the - system looting .
The Elites ' interests diverge from those of the society as a whole .
The result is a profound political disunity of hardened , bitter camps warring over the remaining spoils of a decaying State .
Regulations are replaced by protection schemes and layers of purposefully inpenetrable obfuscation which provide the Elites exemptioms from market forces ( risk and subsequent losses ) .
Healthcare is replaced by a highly profitable simulacrum structure in which 25 % of the citizenry receive no care and another 25 % pay for sham " healthcare coverage " which offers little to no actual care .
The high - caste class of State and corporate technocrats is rewarded for their services to the State / Plutocracy with full coverage .
( Observe the parallels to State employees ' coveted positions in Third World kleptocracies . )
The unfettered free press is replaced with a corporate media tasked with protecting the interests of the State and Plutocracy which owns it lock , stock and barrel .
Truthfulness is replaced by lies , deception , trickery and a pervasive , willful obscurity in every level of society and the economy .
Simulacrums of capital are passed off as assets .
A sham prosperity based on exponential growth of credit / debt is presented as sustainable " capitalism . "
Misallocation of capital and looting are masked as " market forces . "
Incomplete , misleading , and romanticized information is presented in support of simulacrum while truthful accountings are suppressed , belittled and undermined .
Lived experience is derealized by ever - present media fantasies ( " we have the finest healthcare system in the world , " " the banking sector is free enterprise at its finest , " " you too can be a star , " etc. ) and the schizophrenic gap between experience and media fantasy is papered over with drugs ( prescribed , illegal and legal ) and distractions ( celebrity worship , entertainment / sports , narcissistic indulgences , shopping , etc. )
Dissent is filtered into distracting , meaningless simulacrum of " ideological debates " of no substance , " debates " which leave the Power Elite and State in control of the national income .
Obesity , passivity and addiction are incentivized as poor nutrition and chronic illness are the highest - return " profit centers " for the agribusiness / packaged / fast - food industry and the simulacrum " healthcare " ( actually sick - care ) industry .
The unavoidable failures and destructive consequences of the status quo are systematically internalized as personal failings : lack of will power , poor judgment , etc. ; a simulacrum of " personal responsibility " masks the internalization of propaganda / master narratives which leave the Plutocracy and State safely unaccountable .
From the perspective of a media sustained by marketing , the ideal internal state is a deep , unresolvable insecurity which can be temporarily soothed by shopping / entertainment .
A simulacrum of citizenship reduces a self - directed populace to passive " consumers . "
This process is so subtle and subconscious that it is difficult to discern .
But once you understand this substitution mechanism , a type of enlightenment occurs ; you no longer accept simulacrum for " the real thing , " and the State / Plutocracy has lost your compliance , that is , your belief in the system 's fair accounting of your self - interest .
This conflict between direct , lived experience of our ever - worsening problems and the State / Elites ' " ignore reality , keep believing in our system " machinery causes a pervasive cultural and individual schizophrenia which causes participants to feel adrift , depressed , alienated , isolated and misunderstood .
The Elites ' intellectual framework has a ready response to this ever - widening divide between their increasingly rickety narrative and reality : the metaphors of illness and medicine .
Thus the " solution " to the deep misgivings of those who sense the divide between a false narrative and their own experience is prescription medications in quantity .
This growing gulf between lived experience and the Elites ' heavily hyped narrative of how our world works eventually causes an enlightenment in some of the managerial / technocrat caste : their belief in the system fades and they drop out .
Once they realize the institutions they have given their lives to will fail , they either withdraw or begin work on an alternative framework of understanding based on their own experience .
In seeking experience - based ways to understand our challenges and potential solutions which do n't simply serve and enrich Elites , they become part of The Remnant , a self - selected assembly of citizenry who lead by example , not exhortation -- in other words , the advance guard of a sustainable economy and free society .
The Remnant is a diverse and self - organizing group of people who are skeptical of overly simplistic contexts and solutions , and skeptical of the Elites ' authority structures ( the prison / drug gulag , taxation of everything and everyone but the sheltered Elites , recruitment of the poor to military service so the Elites ' offspring need not serve , a food and " healthcare " system which encourages illness and chronic ill - health as the most profitable possible conditions , etc. )
The Remnant has learned that the Power Elite has essentially rendered itself unaccountable and thus the consequences of its vast over - reach will fall not on its own small membership but the ill - prepared citizenry below .
The entrenched high - caste bureaucrats and other technocrats are busy looting the coffers of the State on behalf of themselves and their Plutocrat Masters , and this large caste will only wither when the State becomes insolvent -- the end - game of the current borrow - and - spend debt orgy which has sustained the American economy , Plutocracy and State for decades .
Thus The Remnant is preparing for life without State largesse , because the State will no longer be able to borrow or print enough money to support its increasingly burdensome castes , entitlements and fiefdoms .
In my terminology , the Remnant 's goal is radical self - reliance .
Lastly ,
The Remnant is acutely aware that the environmental , financial and FEW ( food , energy , water ) dilemmas facing the planet are not ones of interpretation ; they are very real and cannot be explained away or " framed " out of existence with appeals to soothingly vague future technocratic wonders .
This book is an attempt to strip away the obfuscatory intellectual framework which has cloaked and protected the Elites ' self - serving over - reach .
It is an attempt to speak directly to the real problems we face .
Once we understand our own experience and the world directly then the messy , conflicting realities of various solutions and trade - offs will become clearer .
Then we will have to choose which trade - offs have the best chances for long - term success -- not in preserving the bankrupt , unsustainable structures of the present but in constructing a sustainable , productive economy and a political culture based not on self - serving game - the - system looting but on the radical self - reliant appreciation of the fundamental rights to life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness .
End note : I know this must strike some readers as lunacy ; there are no simulacrum , and the State cannot possibly dissolve in insolvency .
Others will be tempted to enter the merry - go - round " debate " as to whether the State should or should not be a " Savior . "
It does n't matter ; the State cannot print up $ 100 trillion without reducing the value of the dollar to zero , nor can it fund the military / security / Empire , its own domestic fiefdoms and the Savior State entitlements now promised to 300 million citizens without borrowing / printing $ 100 trillion -- so however you care to calculate the end - state , it remains the same : insolvency and the complete devolution of the Empire / Savior State .
Key concepts in this chapter : Plantation - like structures debt - serfs derealize / derealization Neoliberal Capitalist Democracy ( the dominant ideology ) profound political disunity Savior State belief in the system fades The Remnant radical self - reliance
Chapter Three : Toward An Integrated Understanding
The first task is replacing the crumbling intellectual framework of the present status quo system with one grounded in reality .
There are five distinct issues to sort out :
The elements of human nature which lend themselves to cycles and manipulation
The nature of the energy , financial and environmental trends / crises which are heralding the Great Transformation
The nature of the negative and positive feedback loops which determine the system 's stability and direction
The responses which have a high probability of making the Transformation positive
The nature of future work and the skillsets best suited to prospering during the Great Transformation
If we mischaracterize the nature of the crises and fail to grasp the forces powering these trends , then we will select inappropriate responses which will not prepare us to prosper .
If we fail to understand how the status quo benefits various Elites , then we will inaccurately frame the " problems " and reach guaranteed - to - fail " solutions . "
You may well disagree with much or perhaps most of this book ; that 's fine , because the primary goal of the book is to spark a reappraisal of our situation and generate practical responses .
I do n't claim to have " the answer , " or even answers ; what I hope to present is a way of thinking about the challenges which is more productive than the status quo .
You may also find some of the ideas presented here difficult to accept .
None of us like to think of ourselves as debt - serfs ( yes , I have a mortgage , too ) , yet how can we move forward if we cannot be honest about our responsibilities and dilemmas ?
We are all vulnerable to groupthink , propaganda and marketing at various times ; there is no shame in simply being human .
Some of you may find parts of the analysis smacking of warmed - over Marxism , while an equal number may find certain sections " right - wing . "
This urge to categorize any idea or analysis ideologically is part of the simulacrum of thinking we accept as " obvious " -- the largely unconscious politics of experience .
That much of what we accept as " obvious " might be wrong is deeply unsettling .
Context One : Human Nature
The first context we must understand is human nature .
Regardless of the era or challenge , humans remain " wired " to respond to crisis in the same basic ways .
Unfortunately for us , our responses in " default mode " ( our first emotional responses ) and the solutions we find highly compelling in default mode ( inertia / complacency , fear / panic , casting our lot with a " Big Man " / leader or fatalism / giving up ) are often not constructive , and may well be highly destructive .
Even more pernicious , our default mode is extremely short - term .
As small groups of hunter - gatherers , we simply walked away when we 'd depleted the environment of resources ; there were always other lands ( or islands ) available .
In this fashion , ancient humans wandered the entire planet long before the first tilled crop was ever planted .
Our default ability to foresee the consequences of our actions is poor ; thus time and again human societies have added population and " overhead costs " during prosperous times of ample rainfall and grain yields , only to collapse in catastrophic decline when a string of lean years inevitably came along .
In abundance , we freely spend what 's " cheap " and in shortage we mourn what is now " dear " or no longer available .
It 's not difficult to see the same pattern repeating today .
While it is possible for humans to fashion long - term plans out of self - interest , we are peculiarly ill - equipped to make the critical distinction between relative scarcity and absolute scarcity .
Thus we will hunt a species to extinction without regards to the long - term negative consequences for own diet .
To a mind selected for hunting and gathering , the local scarcity ( that is , relative scarcity ) of any one critical food or energy source is remedied by simply moving on to a new hunting ground with relative abundance .
In cases where humans have hunted a species to extinction , such as the woolly mammoth , then the human solution remains the same : move on .
In the event some other tribe already occupies a territory of relative abundance , the human response is to begin hunting their own species of the " other tribe . "
In terms of straight kilocalorie analysis , this is entirely rational : the " cost " of war in terms of lives lost and calories expended is well worth the longlasting benefits of conquering new fertile territories and elminating competitors .
Thus it is not at all specious to suggest that monopoly capital and conquest by whatever means the most attractive cost / benefit ratio have long been a human strategy to maximize gains / profits , and marking off another human group as the " enemy " is a highly useful tool to gain support of one 's own tribe for the conquest / looting .
Monopoly capital is the mechanism by which capital finds elminating competition to be far more profitable than competing in a free market .
Thus mature industries with high barriers to entry by new competitors ( often these barriers are political or regulatory , purchased by the Plutocracy for modest sums ) end up being dominated by a mere handful of enterprises .
The global mass media is but one example of many .
A similar mechanism is the exempting of capital and high - caste Elites from risk -- that is , from the risks inherent in free markets .
Just as monopoly capital strives to eliminate " uncertainties " ( i.e. losses or reduced returns ) by eliminating competition , capital and high - caste Elites ( public employees , technocrats / professionals , etc. ) strive to exempt themselves from risk and the free market by constructing fiefdoms protected by the State .
In both cases , the goal is to lock in hefty returns without absorbing any of the risks demanded by a free market .
The returns are funneled to the Elites while the risks are spread to the middle class ( which still must deal with the uncertainties of a true free market for labor and capital ) via high taxation .
The advent of language gave humanity tremendous powers of knowledge acquisition and storage , but it also provided methods to influence our interpretations of experience .
Thus we all support " taking care of the elderly " and this automatic support has enabled a relatively small number of enterprises to reap enormous profits selling medications and care to Medicare which in many cases actively increase the elderly 's suffering and dimimish their health .
An estimated 100,000 people die from prescription drug errors or hospital infections , but Medicare spending continues to expand at twice the rate of the overall economy , year after year .
Seniors quickly gain prescriptions to a dozen or more medications once they qualify for Medicare - - a brew of drugs whose interactions are poorly understood and whose benefits are often marginal at best .
The compelling catch - phrases which are deployed to mask looting and profiteering are legion : " defending our nation , " " restoring the health of our banking sector , " etc .
Thus we have to be especially alert to how elites deploy these powerful linguistic / emotional attractors to cloak their monopolies , influence , over - reaching and looting .
Lastly , the mind is remarkably easy to hijack via emotional reward receptors .
Former FDA head David Kessler recently described how the food industry designs its products to activate these reward centers with faux - foods loaded with sugar , fat and salt ( from his book The End of Overeating : Taking Control of the Insatiable American Appetite ) :
They are n't selling just any commodity .
They 've designed highly stimulating products , and consumers come back for more .
Nothing sells as much as something that stimulates the rewards - circuitry of the brain .
It 's all about selling product .
Unfortunately , humans are prone to a formidably long and varied List of cognitive biases ( Wikipedia ) .
Those tasked with manipulating public opinion for political or financial gain are of course well - versed in these biases , which I would characterize as cognitive traps , and highly attuned to the most productive times and places to deploy them .
Despite the many traps in our default modes of thinking and our pernicious tropism toward short - term contexts , when we have no choice left then we are capable of making short - term sacrifices to further long - term gains .
This is the response we need to foster to survive the Great Transformation just ahead .
Context Two : Cycles and Patterns of History
While every era of crisis is unique , authors such as David Fischer ( The Great Wave : Price Revolutions and the Rhythm of History ) , Jared Diamond ( Collapse : How Societies Choose to Fail or Succeed ) and Joseph Tainter ( The Collapse of Complex Societies ) have carefully researched how cycles of price , conflict and resource depletion / exhaustion tend to repeat as human populations rise beyond the carrying capacity of their environment .
I address these cycles in Food Shortages , Rising Prices , Stagnant Wages :
Welcome to the 13th Century ( reprinted in a later chapter ) .
As we seek to understand long - wave cycles , we must also recognize that the crises of our era are unique even as they are manifesting within historical cycles .
A number of recent books have described the unique set of challenges we face : for instance The Long Emergency : Surviving the End of Oil , Climate Change , and Other Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty - First Century ( James Howard Kunstler ) and Financial Armageddon : Protecting Your Future from Four Impending Catastrophes ( Michael Panzner ) .
Other books have addressed critical environmental , energy and demographic issues : The Future of Life , Beyond Oil : The View from Hubbert 's Peak , Fewer : How the New Demography of Depopulation Will Shape Our Future , The Coming Generational Storm : What You Need to Know about America 's Economic Future , The Rhythm of War and The Fourth Turning .
Given this wealth of material , I hesitate to even attempt a short summary of all the interwoven structural challenges of our era .
But the key context is this : financial and resource crises are not new ; they are recurring features of human civilization .
But many aspects of our era's crises are unique in all of human history : never before have we faced depletion of fossil fuels and the population pressures of over 6.5 billion humans to feed , house , clothe , transport , heal and care for in their old age .
Never before have we as a species been so dependent on fragile supply chains and fast - depleting global resources .
Consider the overfishing of the world 's oceans ; what once seemed inexhaustible the supply of fish is now heading to near - zero .
Ironically , this cyclical nature of crisis lends itself to the emotional power of complacency : if we managed to get through those crises , then we can do it again , the power of human innovation will save us , etc .
Unfortunately , there have been many times when the human populace did not " get through " the crisis ; populations collapsed to mere shadows of their levels reached in the years of rising abundance .
Current structural challenges include : 1 . demographics ( promised retirement benefits are unaffordable ) 2 . global financial deleveraging ( renunciation / write - off of debt ) 3 . high - cost advanced economies , " Planet of Slums " developing economies 4 . rising interest rates ( shortage of surplus capital ) 5 . de-scaling / disruption of entrenched industries / State fiefdoms by the Web 6 . scalability traps / structural job losses in all economies 7 . crippling regulation and overhead burdens on small entrepreneurs 8 . fossil fuel depletion ( Peak Oil ) 9 . " head - fake " drop in energy costs removes incentives for alternative energy 10 .
political disunity ; elites ' interests diverge from those of the society as a whole 11 .
rising income disparity 12 .
depletion of fresh water , ocean and soil resources 13 .
climate change ( weather extremes , rising sea levels , etc. ) 14 . increasingly drug- resistant bacteria and viruses 15 .
rising chemical and industrial pollution levels ( air , water , soil , etc. ) 16 .
increasing availability of bioweapons and nuclear weapons I summarize the four primary cycles in my book Weblogs & New Media : Marketing in Crisis : 1 . Peak oil , or the depletion cycle / end - game of the global economy 's complete dependence on inexpensive , readily available petroleum / fossil fuels .
2 . The cycle of credit expansion and contraction ( approximately 60 - 70 years ) , which is now beginning the transition from unsustainable credit expansion ( bubble ) to renunciation of debt ( credit collapse ) and global depression .
3 . The generational cycle ( 4 generations or approximately 80 years ) of American history which leads to nation - changing social , political and economic upheaval .
( The American Revolution : 1781 +80 years = Civil War , 1861 +80 years = 1941 , World War II + 80 years = 2021 ) 4 . The 100 + year cycle of price inflation and stagnation of wages ' purchasing power which began around 1901 is now reaching the final stage of widespread turmoil , shortages , famine , war , conflict and crisis .
Without a firm understanding of the cyclical nature of human history and the unique challenges of our era , we are hard - pressed to escape the comforting illusions of complacency and fatalism .
A key point is that the above crises ( or potential crises ) are not discrete phenomena which can be solved in piecemeal fashion but rather interlocking , overlapping and in some cases reinforcing problems which range from long - term depletions to volatile geopolitical tensions which could burst into conflict .
Over an intermediate time scale , a weather crisis such as extended drought could cause a food shortage which might then put a match to a smouldering geopolitical tenderbox .
The complacency and misplaced confidence of the status quo render these unpredictable interactions all the more combustible because so little has been done to anticipate the potential domino effect of these global crises .
Context Three : Interlocking / Reinforcing Crises , Time Scales and Globalization
One of the factors which renders the intersecting crises of the next 15 - 25 years so difficult to predict is the multiple time scales at work .
A global petroleum shortage , for example , could stagger the developed world in a very short time span as hoarding and govermental rationing would quickly magnify the disruptions .
Food shortages might develop over a longer period of months as drought , energy shortages and geopolitical issues caused a sharp decline in grain production and / or shipping .
A nuclear war between two long - standing adversaries such as India and Pakistan could erupt in a matter of weeks should internal crises trigger border tensions .
China might suddenly deem the moment ripe to conquer Taiwan with military force , loosing a cascading crisis which could lead to limited or even nuclear war between the U.S. and China .
Any war involving the Mideast , East Asia or the U.S. might dramatically effect oil , currencies and trade which would quickly impact economies , food supplies and the psychology of instability / fear / hoarding .
Ironically , the great benefits of globalization -- long oil - dependent supply chains leading from distant factories to free - spending debt - fueled Western consumers -- can reverse with extraordinary speed as these very same fragile supply chains degrade or shatter in moments of energy , finance or geopolitical crisis .
Very long - wave crises are only visible to historians and those willing to root around obscure data .
Thus the slow , steady redistribution of national wealth away from the middle class into the pockets of the State and Plutocracy is barely discernable .
Yet just because this movement of wealth , capital and income appears glacial does not mean the effects are insignificant ; on the contrary , this over - reach by the State and Plutocracy at the expense of the tax - paying middle class is in some ways as important a cause of collapse as more immediate crises such as Peak Oil and the depletion of fresh water acquifers .
That crises unfolding in different time scales will overlap is easily predictable , but the precise intersection or overlay of various crises is entirely unpredictable .
Some geopolitical tension might close the Straits of Hormuz or Malacca , and the resulting restriction of sealanes and oil tankers might trigger some other unstable crisis .
It is also easily predictable that any one nation and its citizenry will have limited control or influence over a truly global crisis .
We can also safely predict the complacent and / or fatalistic nations and citizens will suffer more than those who proactively anticipated the likelihood of interlocking , reinforcing crises occurring within the next decade or two .
Ideally , such proactive anticipation should involve households , communities and the nation at large .
But if the State ( government at all levels ) is in denial or deadlock , or crippled by debt or otherwise insolvent , then households and communities will also have to prepare themselves for dwindling State aid .
Even if the State does set aside prudent reserves , these are designed to smooth short - term crises , not semi-permanent declines in the FEW essentials ( food , energy , water ) .
For instance , the 600 - million barrel U.S. Strategic Petroleum Reserve holds about one month 's supply of oil ( 20 million barrels a day consumed in the U.S. X 30 days ) .
While this is certainly a reassuring number in a short - term crisis , it would be foolhardy to think a one - month 's supply will prove to be anything more than a stopgap should oil imports plummet over the long - term .
As we shall see later , various feedback loops ( both positive and negative ) are at work as each crisis erupts ; in some scenarios negative feedback might stem the crisis ; in others , a domino effect could transpire , toppling vulnerabilities which encircle the globe .
This is why time - sensitive predictions are foolhardy , both those predicting " the end of the world as we know it " and those spouting the " it will all work out just fine " complacency favored by the mass media and Plutocracy .
What we can predict is that fragile systems without redundancy are vulnerable to disruptions which could then freeze up or degrade the entire supply chain .
If these impact the critical FEW resources ( food , energy , water ) then the disruption can quickly expand to other systems which were previously thought secure / safe .
System prone to positive feedback ( the runaway self - reinforcing crisis ) are inherently more vulnerable to collapse than those with multiple negative feedbacks -- forces which counteract the trend .
The problem for the complacent is that time scales , vulnerabilities , overlap and interactions differ for each crisis .
Thus a fast - moving crisis with slow negative feedback ( correctives ) could race beyond the reach of corrective action , triggering other fast - spreading crises in its wake .
In a world so deeply dependent on cheap , abundant liquid fossil fuels for everything from transportation to food , the vulnerability and interdependency of all energy - dependent systems to shortage or disruption is acute and works across all time scales .
The Commodity Unlike Any Other : Oil Standard - issue economists tend to treat oil / fossil fuels as a commodity like any other ; when demand rises , new or alternative supplies will emerge once they become profitable .
But this model is utterly misleading , for liquid hydrocarbons are special in three distinctive ways : they contain very high energy densities , they are stable at normal temperatures and they are readily transportable via pipeline , ship , train or vehicle .
No other energy source possesses all these traits , and those that get close ( lithium ion batteries , for instance ) are very costly to manufacture and are dependent on dwindling metals / ores ( in this case , lithium ) .
Supposedly " renewable " sources like biofuels and " unlimited " sources like shale oil require so much energy to produce , process and transport ( when calculated in equivalent energy densities ) that the net energy ( useful energy produced minus energy used in production ) is actually rather paltry .
Until very recently , oil had the distinct advantage of being cheap to extract .
Super - giant fields under pressure gushed oil for as little as $ 1 per barrel in raw costs .
But the super - giant fields which supply much of the world 's oil now require costly extraction technologies such as water or gas pressurization .
New production has been located offshore , in deep water or in extreme climates like the Arctic Circle .
It is no longer cheap to locate , extract or process oil or oil equivalents like shale oil .
Oil 's most unique charcateristic is that every other industry in the global economy depends on oil or oil equivalents : transportation , military , agriculture , tourism , and on and on .
Thus a global shortage or disruption will quickly cascade into every corner of the global economy , for new supplies of oil cannot be brought on line quickly ( five years would be incredibly quick , ten years would be average ) .
Even worse , new production is not even replacing fields in decline ; that is the essence of Peak Oil .
As for alternatives : currently , all alternative energy production , including both " old technology " like hydropower and new wind , solar , biofuel and tidal technologies , account for considerably less than 5 % of the world 's energy consumption .
Thus a ten - fold increase in alternative energy - - a scaling up which is not yet even technoloigically feasible , and one that in any event would cost trillions of dollars to accomplish -- would leave the global economy totally dependent on petroleum for 2/3 of energy consumption .
Thus any model which views energy / petroleum / fossil fuels as subject to the same forces as other commodities such as copper is fatally flawed .
Every industry and financial sector ultimately rests on cheap , abundant petroleum .
Once petroleum is no longer cheap or available in sufficient quantity to meet demand , then the energy domino will topple all the rest in rapid succession .
The unique commodity petroleum is thus the very foundation of interlocking / reinforcing crises on a global scale .

Context Four : Ontological Forces Which Power Trends , Reversals and History Within each context , various forces are at work to resist and accelerate trends .
These forces include feedback loops ( both positive and negative ) , marginal returns and the illusion of incremental change .
Negative feedback can be understood as systems with built - in stabilizers , while positive feedback can be understood as self - reinforcing .
I will cover ontological forces and analytic tools in Chapter Seven .
Context Five : The Environment
It is tempting to hope that all the structural environmental challenges will " sort themselves out " or be solved by some new technology that magically scales from the lab table to global ubiquity .
But the realities do not lend themselves to either benign neglect ( that is , just leave everything alone and it will rebalance itself naturally ) or technological " fixes . "
The human population has exploded in a geological eyeblink from several hundred million to 6.5 billion .
In terms of energy and resource consumption , each resident of the First World ( Europe , North America , Japan ) has an environmental impact up to 100 times larger than that of a Third World person .
As 2 billion people in China , India and elsewhere aspire to an energy - intensive consumerist First World lifestyle , the reality that the planet does not have the resources to support 3 billion middle - class consumers is readily visible .
The list of global environmental ills is well - known .
Overfishing driven by insatiable demand and politically popular subsidies of national fishing industries has driven the world 's fisheries to the point of collapse .
The technological " fix " is aquaculture / aqua - farming , but artificial fisheries spawn another entire host of their own challenges to long - term sustainability .
The depletion of cheap , easy to reach oil is also well - known ; less well - known is that all the alternative energy sources in the entire world geothermal , hydro , solar , wind , tidal , etc. -- make up less than 5 % of global energy supply .
While natural gas and coal can fill some of the gaps as oil supply falls , neither of those fuels is endless , either and " clean coal " is yet another technology that is promising in the lab but not scalable globally without horrendous cost .
Fresh water aquifers are being drained everywhere from the American southwest to China , and there are no sustainable ways to compensate for this drawdown of irreplaceable fresh - water resources .
Schemes to desalinate vast quantities of seawater requires stupendous amounts of energy ; a recent plan by Saudi Arabia would burn fully 1 million barrels of oil a day 1 million barrels that could no longer be exported to the U.S. Regardless of what we believe the causes might be , glaciers are melting at increasing rates .
Once the Himalayan and Andean glaciers vanish or recede to mere patches of ice , the rivers 2 billion people rely on for irrigation water will become seasonal .
Add in massive soil erosion in China and elsewhere , extended droughts in Australia , etc. , and you get a picture of global resources stretched to the breaking point .
The more you know about the technical details of supposedly miraculous technological " fixes " like desalination , tidal energy , algae - based fuels , etc. etc. , the more you understand that very few if any of these emerging technologies may " scale up " to global applications .
In other words , algae - based fuels can work just fine on the rooftop of a university lab , but the hard part is scaling it up to produce 1.7 billion gallons of gasoline - equivalent liquid fuel a day which is only half of the world 's current consumption of oil .
( Total global consumption of oil , 80 million barrels a day , so 40 million barrels a day X 42 gallons / barrel . )
Add these realities up and the context is a potential crash of global food and fresh water supplies , exacerbated by energy shortages .
As authors such as Jared Diamond have explained , eras of resource depletion / drought often trigger unending war / conflict between competing groups and nations .
In essence there are four interlocking crises : environmental , energy , financial and geopolitical .
Excellent sources abound on these topics : The Future of Life , Beyond Oil : The View from Hubbert 's Peak , and The Long Emergency : Surviving the End of Oil , Climate Change , and Other Converging Catastrophes of the Twenty - First Century come to mind of the many useful texts in print .
Context Six : The End of Debt - Based " Prosperity " The " prosperity " of the past two decades was based not on savings , investment and productivity , as the mainstream financial media and think - tank punditry maintain , but by extremes of speculative credit , leverage , debt and risk - taking , all enabled by a financial system based on obfuscation , deception , embezzlement , fraud , abuse of credit and grossly inflated asset valuations , a.k.a. bubbles .
This debt binge was fed by a marketing - based consumerist culture in which shopping and acquisition became recreation , therapy , self - fulfillment and status all in one profit - driven package .
Compounding the collapse of this debt - based bogus " prosperity " are two long - term trends : the end of cheap , abundant fossil fuels which enabled inexpensive global supply chains and tourism , and the " end of work , " a global contraction of paid labor .
Context Seven : Squeezing the Middle Class
The intersection of various long - term political and financial trends is effectively squeezing the middle class , which the State ( government ) depends on to pay most of the taxes .
Caught between the over - reach of both the state and its elites ( the Plutocracy ) and the end of debt - based , cheap - oil " prosperity " which enabled it to maintain an illusion of wealth , the middle class is being squeezed to the breaking point .
I address this topic in a later chapter .
Context Eight : The Nature of Prosperity and Happiness The U.S. Declaration of Independence recognizes the inalienable rights to " life , liberty and the pursuit of happiness . "
Oddly enough , happiness turns out to be a slippery concept , and much of what Americans spend their lives pursuing does not actually increase their happiness .
Indeed , it is self - evident that the stress levels , medication usage and miseries of the " American lifestyle " even in times of prosperity are far higher than one would expect were happiness as abundant as cheap consumer goods .
And even prosperity itself turns out to be rather more slippery than rising GDP or other metrics would suggest .
It seems that much of what passes for " essential accoutrements of prosperity " such as large suburban homes , multiple vehicles and closets crammed with clothing do not bring happiness to their owners .
Rather , they are largely the mirage - like results of marketing propaganda conjured up to generate profits , not life satisfaction or happiness .
Indeed , were we to travel back in time to 1870s San Francisco , for example , we would find people feeling quite prosperous even though they lived in what we would now consider relatively primitive poverty : no electricity , no vehicles except public streetcars , ( On August 2 , 1873 , the inventor of the San Francisco cable car , Andrew Hallidie , was the system 's first passenger ) , trains and horse - drawn wagons , primitive healthcare , costly consumer goods , etc .
Thus the entire notions of prosperity and happiness must be examined objectively before we can even say with any reliability what the words actually mean .
Context Nine : The Framework of Our Response
Our responses to these interwoven , reinforcing challenges of our era can be organized into three inter-related levels : -- family -- community / networks -- nation Each level requires different skills , resources , inputs and solutions .
I will cover these topics in the second section .
Key concepts in this chapter : politics of experience simulacrum of thinking cognitive traps scalability traps FEW resources ( food , energy , water )
Chapter Four : Complacency and Fatalism
Let 's begin by considering Context One : Human Nature in more depth .
Entire libraries have been written on the subject of human nature , but for our practical purposes those which probe humanity 's " default settings " such as Jared Diamond 's The Third Chimpanzee : The Evolution and Future of the Human Animal and E.O. Wilson 's Sociobiology : The New Synthesis are the most useful .
Although we can slice and dice complex human responses in hundreds of ways ( for instance , Who am I ?
The 16 Basic Desires that Motivate Our Actions an
Lauded for its mature and philosophical narrative , SMT : Persona stands apart from other RPGs of its era , blending sophisticated storytelling with addictive combat , demon negotiation , and demon fusion components .
Boasting a fully redone localization ( including content never before seen in North America ) , all - new music , beautiful new animated sequences overseen by famed artist Kazuma Kaneko , enhanced graphics and sound , adjustments to game balance , and a number of technical and design improvements , this is the definitive version of one of the most sought after RPGs of all time .
Shin Megami Tensei : Persona is currently scheduled to release in stores and via PlayStation Network on September 22 , 2009 .
Both versions have an MSRP of $ 39.99 , but only the physical launch copies will include the game ’s soundtrack on 2 discs , all packaged in a premium oversized outer box .
The Keep Britain Tidy campaign should take its own advice and " bin the filth " by removing posters which use " offensive " sexual innuendo , campaigners said .
The posters - which use phrases including " trim my bush " , " see the size of our Fanny's " , and " Are you a dirty Chucker ? " - were " offensive and inappropriate " , the Plain English Campaign said .
Chrissie Maher , founder of the Plain English Campaign added : " As a woman , a grandmother and a tax - payer I am offended , disappointed and disgusted to find that such a worthy cause considers this language suitable for public information . "
They are part of Keep Britain Tidy's " youth litter " campaign and are marked as appropriate for anyone over the age of 15 .
The Keep Britain Tidy spokeswoman said : " The posters are specifically aimed at young people over the age of 18 and they aim to raise the issue of litter in a cheeky and humorous way .
" They have never been used as adverts and are only available to individuals who order them through Keep Britain Tidy .
" It is our responsibility to ensure that we are using the most effective methods to raise awareness of litter to people of all ages and we always base our actions on research .
" The posters are nearly 10 years old but remain popular today as their cult style and non-patronising tone can still deliver important messages about litter and society that is particularly relevant to a younger , but sophisticated audience . "

Anything by Garbriel García Márquez -
This man is amazing .
Actually , Spanish literature is just amazing , and this man is an incredible part of it .
If you speak Spanish relatively well , I highly recommend you read it in its original form .
If not , it 's well worth checking out anyway .
One of my favorites of his short stories is " La Siesta del Martes . "
Atlas Shrugged , Ayn Rand -
Yes , it is really , really long .
And , yes , it 's a little more intellectual than your average bookstore shelf - topper .
But it 's also interesting , thought - provoking , and relevant .
The only thing I have trouble with is that it drags on a bit at the end .
But all in all it is worth reading .
Here 's a few books I 've read and enjoyed recently : Tortilla Curtain , TC Boyle - Interesting novel about illegal immigration and Southern California .
It follows two families , a wealthy , liberal family living in an exclusive community with two lap dogs and an Acura , and a family of illegal immigrants living in the canyon nearby and struggling to survive .
It 's worth reading , especially if you live in Southern California , as it raises some very timely questions about immigration and racism . , George Orwell -
An all - time favorite .
Just read it .
It makes you think .
You 'll like it .

After last week ’s organic food online forum , we ’re ready for the next course .
This week ’s topic : recycling and waste .
The modern recycling movement got its start alongside the first Earth Day , nearly 40 years ago this week .
Since then , recycling ’s gone mainstream : Americans now recycle and compost a third of their trash , up from just 6 percent in 1970 .
Yet , as detailed in the current issue of Mother Jones , we ’re generating more waste than ever before .
In just 5 minutes , we use another 1,060,000 aluminum cans , 2 million plastic bottles , and 15 million sheets of paper .
We ’re still drowning in plastic , New York recycles only a fifth of its garbage , and trash haulers still find landfill more profitable than recycling .
Then consider that municipal solid waste — that ’s the stuff that fills our home garbage cans and office paper bins — is just 2.5 percent of our total “ Gross National Trash ” output .
While we ’ve been agonizing over whether our plastic yogurt lids can be recycled , have we been missing the big picture ?
Is recycling giving us a false sense that we ’re solving our waste problem ?
We put that question to four experts : Elizabeth Royte , Eric Lombardi , Annie Leonard , and Susan Strasser .
Check out some highlights from their answers below the jump .
Or head on over to our recycling online forum , which kicks off today .
For the rest of this week , our panelists will be checking in to respond to readers , discuss and debate the future of recycling and waste , and perhaps even solve the mystery of the yogurt lid .
Elizabeth Royte i s the author of Bottlemania : How Water Went On Sale and Why We Bought It and Garbage Land : On the Secret Trail of Trash .
Her article on zero - waste zealots appears in the current issue of Mother Jones .
Yes , I think that people feel they ’re doing their part for the environment by putting recyclables into containers at the curb or bringing them to a drop - off center ( and they are helping the earth ) .
But that feeling also allows some to continue business as usual — to consume and waste ever more stuff : “ I recycle those single - use plastic bottles , so it ’s okay to keep buying them . ”
Eric Lombardi is the executive director of Eco - Cycle , one of the nation ’s largest nonprofit recyclers .
He is a cofounder of the GrassRoots Recycling Network and the Zero Waste International Alliance .
In the bigger picture , recycling is like a gateway drug in that it is the first environmental action of every good Republican .
I think the recycling stage is a very large one , and those of us who work on it have unlimited opportunities to create stories , presentations , and visions about all sorts of important environmental issues , including “ game - changing ideas ” like zero waste , zero carbon , and zero population growth .
Annie Leonard i s an environmental researcher and campaigner .
She is also the author and host of The Story of Stuff , an animated online exposé of the hidden costs of consumption .
There is a reason that recycling comes last in the oft - repeated mantra of “ reduce , reuse , recycle . ”
That is where it should be : a last resort .
I say that recycling is the opiate of the masses .
It makes us feel good , like we ’ve done our part .
Susan Strasser is a professor of history at the University of Delaware and the author of Waste and Want : A Social History of Trash .
She has been praised by The New Yorker for “ retrieving what history discards : the taken - for - granted minutiae of everyday life . ”
Americans have sorted trash for recycling for centuries .
These practices were forgotten during the mid-twentieth century , and in recent years , sorting trash for recycling has become a symbol of care about the environment .

The handset has boosted sales for O2 Vodafone has reached an agreement to sell Apple 's popular iPhone in the UK .
The announcement follows news that network operator Orange had secured a similar agreement with Apple .
The deals mark an end to the exclusive UK arrangement between O2 and the US technology firm , which has been in place since 2007 .
Vodafone says users can register an interest online , with the handsets becoming available to customers from early 2010 .
Orange said its customers would be able to buy the phone " later this year " but did not specify a date or pricing .
Vodafone is one of the biggest mobile operators in the world with an estimated 300 million customers world wide , making it the second largest carrier after China Mobile .
The agreement sees both Orange and Vodafone selling both the iPhone 3G and iPhone 3GS .
A spokesperson for Vodafone said the firm was " delighted " at securing an agreement with Apple and that the phone was going to be primarily for existing Vodafone customers .
This is a different model from that adopted by O2 , which used the iPhone as an incentive to attract new customers .
Exclusivity O2 has offered the handset in the UK since its launch in 2007 .
In February , it said it had sold more than one million of the handsets .
The launch of the latest iPhone 3GS in June significantly boosted sales , with many stores running out of stock .
The phone has also allowed the firm to win subscribers from other networks , according to analysts .
Dave McQueen , principal analyst at Informa Telecoms and Media told BBC News said that the smartphones - which have the ability to surf the web and send e-mail - has put a burden on the O2 network .
" IPhone users to tend to use data quite extensively - perhaps more than anticipated , " he said .
O2 will continue to sell the handset in Britain , alongside iPhone rival the Palm Pre .
The Palm phone , described by some as an " iPhone killer " , will be available exclusively to O2 from 16 October .
O2 said that it always knew that its exclusive deal was for " a limited period of time " .
In countries where exclusive deals still persist , such as the US , some customers choose to " unlock " their phones using third party software so they work on an unlicensed network .
However , Apple has warned that the practice can cause " irreparable " damage to a handset and has engaged in a game of cat - and - mouse , releasing periodic software updates which prevent unlocked phones from working correctly .

Ukraine 's Got Talent ?
This much we already knew .
There 's Mikhail Bulgakov , Olga Kurylenko and the Klitschko brothers .
We can now add Kseniya Simonova to that list who has won the Ukrainian version of Britain 's Got Talent with sand animation .
Yes , you heard right .
She tells stories through sand .
Here , she recounts Germany conquering Ukraine in the second world war .
She brings calm , then conflict .
A couple on a bench become a woman 's face ; a peaceful walkway becomes a conflagration ; a weeping widow morphs into an obelisk for an unknown soldier .
Simonova looks like some vengeful Old Testament deity as she destroys then recreates her scenes - with deft strokes , sprinkles and sweeps she keeps the narrative going .
She moves the judges to tears as she subtitles the final scene " you are always near " .
Simonova is a real piece of work .
Watching her in action calls to mind Rolf Harris ( " can you tell what it is yet ? " ) and his passion for popularising art .
Yet you wonder how she would fare in the UK 's version of the show .
Piers ?
" Tony Hart 's dead , love - move on . "
Simon ?
" It was all a bit cabaret , sweetheart . "
Amanda ?
" I 'm loving the dress !
You go , girlfriend ! "
Ant and Dec would think her canny , at least .
Maybe I 'm being unfair .
Perhaps it 's not just Ukrainian sophisticates who can appreciate Simonova .
If Susan Boyle can become a YouTube phenomenon , popularise classical singing and send Demi Moore into tweeting meltdown would it really be so strange for Simonova 's compelling animations to do the same ?
It might just happen .
Her war story has over 400,000 views on YouTube and is provoking an interesting debate in the comments section .
Jgoo24 notes that " sand is her bitch " and few would argue with this .
" Maybe the most magnificent master piece of art of all time " says DevinsDad90 , not a man prone to hyperbole .
And also " i just jizzed in my pants " ( thank you , deaddevil6 ) .
Leaving aside the never less than disturbing thoughts of the YouTube massive , it 's clear that Simonova has achieved her goal as an artist .
If we take it that art 's purpose is to illuminate the world in a new way , provoke a reaction , somehow alter the consciousness of the viewer then her work is a huge success .
And that high art can come from a format that produced Stavros Flatley and that it can be popularised and sent around the world is surely some kind of modern miracle .
We can only hope that some young British artist is inspired by this and queues up in the rain with the spoon players , acrobats and Michael Jackson impersonators and makes a similar impact .
But whatever happens , after Simonova 's triumph , do n't ever badmouth the TV talent contest to me .
All three convicted bombers are expected to lodge appeals A court in India has sentenced to death three people for carrying out bombings that killed more than 50 people in Mumbai ( Bombay ) in 2003 .
Haneef Sayyed , his wife Fahmeeda and Ashrat Ansari were convicted last month of murder and conspiracy .
The blasts at the Gateway of India landmark and a jewellery market caused carnage and shocked the nation .
They were said to be in retaliation for the deaths of Muslims during riots in Gujarat state the year before .
Hundreds have been killed in attacks in Mumbai in recent years .
The three convicted bombers were found to have links to a Pakistan - based Islamic militant group , Lashkar - e - Taiba , which investigators believe was involved in the November 2008 attacks on Mumbai .
' Pakistani link ' Judge MR Puranik , sitting at a special anti-terrorism court , ordered that all three people convicted " should be hanged by the neck until dead " .
It would be a mockery of justice if the death penalty is not imposed
Ujjwal Nikam
chief public prosecutor A history of deadly bombings Profile : Lashkar - e- Taiba Eyewitness : Chaos after blasts
They stood impassive in the dock as the sentences were handed down , an AFP news agency correspondent reports .
Their lawyers have indicated that they will appeal against the death penalty , which is given rarely in India and is often delayed indefinitely or commuted by the president , the agency notes .
A lawyer for Haneef Sayyed argued his client should be sent to prison for life without parole and Fahmeeda Sayyed 's counsel also argued against the death penalty , saying she was a poor , uneducated woman pressured into committing the crime by her husband .
Ansari's lawyer , Sushan Kunjuramaran , made no submissions but the convicted bomber told the judge he did not agree with the verdict .
Chief public prosecutor Ujjwal Nikam said the trio's crimes had shown " extreme brutality " and resulted in the " massacre of innocent people " .
" It would be a mockery of justice if the death penalty is not imposed , " he said before sentencing .
The double car bombing in August 2003 left devastation at the Gateway of India and the Zaveri Bazaar market near the Mumba Devi temple in central Mumbai .
A lawyer for Fahmeeda Sayyed argued she had been used by her husband About 180 people were injured .
The three defendants , all of them from Mumbai , were charged under India 's Prevention Of Terrorism
Act , which has since been repealed .
Two others were accused - Mohammed Ansari and Mohammed Hasan .
They were discharged after a review by the special court last year .
The three defendants were convicted of plotting the bombings in co-ordination with Lashkar - e - Taiba .
Lashkar is also accused of carrying out other attacks in India in recent years , including the gun and bomb assault on Mumbai last November .
Feared militants
The judge said all three defendants were members of the group , a charge which they denied .
Lashkar ( the group 's name translates as Soldiers of the Pure ) is one of the most feared groups fighting against Indian control in Kashmir .
It was banned by Pakistan in January 2002 amid pressure that followed the 9/11 attacks on the US .
Until then Lashkar was able to operate openly inside Pakistan , raising funds and recruiting members .
Lashkar was accused by India of bomb attacks on Delhi in October 2005 that killed more than 60 people , and a December 2001 raid on India 's parliament .
Indian investigators have also linked the group to the November 2008 attacks on Mumbai in which gunmen killed 166 people in a three - day rampage .
The man believed to be the only surviving gunman , Mohammad Ajmal Amir Qasab , pleaded guilty to a role in the attack at his trial in India last month .
He , too , could face the death penalty if his confession is accepted and judges agree to impose the maximum penalty .
In another development , Pakistan asked Interpol to issue a global alert for 13 individuals in connection with its investigation into the 2008 attacks .

Monroe died aged 36 in 1962
A US widow is auctioning off the burial plot occupied by her late husband above that of film legend Marilyn Monroe , the Los Angeles Times newspaper says .
" Spend eternity directly above Marilyn Monroe " , says the ad placed on eBay by Elsie Poncher of Beverly Hills .
Bidding opened at $ 500,000 ( £ 303,000 ) , and had reached $ 700,000 by Sunday .
Mrs Poncher said she will be " vacating " the remains of her husband " to make room for a new resident " at LA 's exclusive Westwood Village cemetery .
The widow told the LA Times that she hoped to make enough money to pay off the $ 1.6 m mortgage on her Beverly Hills mansion .
" I can't be more honest than that , " she said .
" I want to leave it free and clear for my kids . "
The cemetery is the final resting place of many celebrities , including Dean Martin , Roy Orbison , Truman Capote , and most recently Farrah Fawcett .
Playboy magnate Hugh Hefner bought the crypt beside Monroe in 1992 .
But Mrs Poncher is selling the chance to reserve a " place in eternity " directly above the Hollywood sex symbol , telling the LA Times that her own husband was placed face down in his crypt on top of the actress , in keeping with his dying wish .
Richard Poncher - who died 23 years ago at the age of 81 - was said to be a successful businessman who worked hard , spent lavishly , and knew " all the gangsters " of LA .
Mrs Poncher said he bought two burial plots from Joe DiMaggio during the US baseball legend 's 1954 divorce from Monroe .
Monroe died in 1962 , aged 36 .
Mrs Poncher says her husband 's remains will be moved over one spot into the crypt intended for her , while she will be cremated when the time comes .
A group of entrepreneurs have created a new community center for hackers in the heart of Silicon Valley called Hacker Dojo , where coders can come together and work on projects any time of the day or week .
The group has just signed a lease on a 4,400 square foot building in Mountain View .
People using the center will pay a $ 100 membership fee every month .
One of the group ’s founding members , David Weekly , tells me the intent is to finally create a place where people can go with no strings attached to meet and work on cool side projects with their friends .
It is a non-profit , not a commercial venture .
The center wo n’t demand any IP rights , equity or anything else — it will be completely hands off .
You might want to “ learn how to code in Python , or give a class on Perl , ” he said .
He said lots of out - of - towners arrive in the valley , looking for a place to hang out with other coders , but until now there has n’t been the perfect place .
A number of informal gathering places exist , including Ritual Roasters , and coworking spaces such as Citizen Space , Hat Factory and Sandbox Suite .
However , the former are almost too casual ( Ritual Roasters is a coffee house , often overcrowded ) , and the latter are spaces where mainly people working on their day jobs come to take refuge from the boredom of their homes — but it ’s still a day job for most of them .
These places are also all based in San Francisco .
Hacker Dojo is meant to be a place where people come to work on non-work projects “ for the sheer joy of it , ” says Weekly , but which might eventually turn into companies down the road .
He said the group is talking with Facebook ’s FbFund , to possibly create a space next door to house and support projects that look like they ’re turning into businesses .
The group has sponsorship from Microsoft , Google and Plug & Play ( a Sunnyvale incubator that provides convenient office space for startups ) .
Right now , there ’s no other place for people in the valley to drop in , and access WiFI and pound away at projects , Weekly said .
There ’s the second floor of the Red Rock Coffee house in Mountain View , but that ’s about it .
The project grew out of a set of events called SuperHappyDevHouse , meant for ad - hoc collaboration , and which became increasingly popular .
Momentum gathered at the 30th such meeting a few months ago , when 400 people showed up .
Weekly and his co-founding members decided to incorporate the organization , and thus was born Hacker Dojo .
Founders include Weekly , founder of the wiki company PBWiki , Jeff Lindsay ( co-creator of DevHouse ) , Kitt Hodsden , Melissalynn Perkins , and Brian Klug .
Advisors include Lee Felsenstein , creator of the Osborne - 1 and a director of the original Homebrew Computer Club where the Apple computer was born ; Mehdi Maghsoodnia , founder of Facetime and former Entrepreneur - In - Residence at Mohr Davidow Ventures ; and Eric Ries co-founder of IMVU .
The group already has 40 people signed up .
It needs a total of 80 to be self - sufficient , Weekly says .
Here ’s how the organization describes itself :
In the spirit of DevHouse , we ’re creating a physical community space for hackers and thinkers on the Peninsula in the San Francisco Bay Area .
This would be a location for events , lectures , parties , BarCamps , DevHouses , LAN parties , hackathons , knitting circles , tinkering , brainstorming , coworking , team offsites , etc .
The facility will be technically run as a “ members only ” private club that is not open to the public – every event must have a responsible Founder / Member present .
It is not the current intent that anybody live at this facility , though people may occasionally sleep over after a long event .

Irb has had awesome autocompletion for some time .
Bond is here to make it even better .
With the latest Bond comes bond / completion , Bond ’s enhanced version of irb / completion that is independent of irb .
This file is simply a list of predefined Bond completions .
What makes it special is that it offers irb ’s completion and some in under 30 lines .
Enhancements that it brings include autocompletion of strings as files and argument autocompletion for Kernel #require and Kernel#system .
And whether you were aware of them or not , it fixes all of these irb completion inconsistencies .
Setup
Using it is mindblowingly … straightforward .
Replace require ' irb / completion ' in your irbrc with :
require ' bond ' Bond .
start
Enhancements
By default irb treats string autocompletion the same as its default completion .
Why not have string completion default to file completion ?:
bash > irb >> File.read '[ TAB ] .git/ LICENSE.txt README.rdoc Rakefile VERSION.yml bond.gemspec ext/ lib/ test / >> File.read ' L [ TAB ] >> File.read ' LICENSE.txt ' >> Dir.entries '~ /[ TAB ] >>
Dir.entries '/ Users/bozo/.i[ TAB ] >> Dir.entries '/ Users/bozo/.irb'
If you ’re executing a shell command , should n’t you be able to autocomplete shell commands ?
>> system ' ec [ TAB ] >> sytem ' echo ' >> `su su sudo sum >> `sud [ TAB ] >> `sudo
What about when you want to require a Ruby library ?
>> require ' b [ TAB ] base64.rb benchmark.rb bigdecimal .
bundle bigdecimal / bond.rb bond / boson.rb boson / >> require ' ba [ TAB ] >> require ' base64.rb ' #
You can navigate directories just like with normal file completion >> require ' b [ TAB ] >> require ' bigdecimal >> require ' bigdecimal /[ TAB ] bigdecimal / jacobian.rb bigdecimal/ludcmp.rb bigdecimal/math.rb bigdecimal/newton.rb bigdecimal/util.rb >> require ' bigdecimal /m[ TAB ] >> require ' bigdecimal/math.rb ' # Local completion defaults to file completion >> require '../ lib/b[ TAB ] >> require '../ test /b[ TAB ] >> require '../test/bond_test.rb'
See here if you ’re curious how the argument completions are done .
Reload With a Tip
If you ’re not familiar with Bond , all this pre-made completion may give you an impression that it ’s hard to make custom completions .
Actually custom completion is Bond ’s strength .
Consider this simple method for reloading required files in the console :
def reload ( require_regex ) $ " . grep ( / #{ require_regex } / ) . each { | e | $ " . delete ( e ) && require ( e ) } end
If you drop this in your irbrc you can do the following :
# reload an individual file >> reload ' bond.rb ' => [ " bond.rb " ] # reload all bond * files in $ " >> reload ' bond *' => [ " bond/readline.rb " , " bond/rawline.rb " , " bond/agent.rb " , " bond/search.rb " , " bond/actions.rb " , " bond/mission.rb " , " bond/missions/default_mission.rb " , " bond/missions/method_mission.rb " , " bond/missions/object_mission.rb " , " bond/completion.rb " , " bond.rb " ]
Sweet .
Now to add autocompletion for it .
It should autocomplete any of the paths in $ " .
>> Bond.complete ( : method= >' reload ' ) { $ " } => true >> reload ' bo [ TAB ] >> reload ' bond
That was n’t too bad .
Irb ’s Completion Inconsistencies
So if you ’re autocompleting an object ’s methods in irb , you should get back the object ’s methods , right ?
Right … most of the time .
First inconsistency up is irb ’s completion of hashes and procs .
Why group them together ?
Because they ’re completed the same in irb :
>> {}.c[ TAB ] }.call }.class }.clear }.clone }.collect >> { }.ca[ TAB ] >> { }.call NoMethodError : undefined method `call ' for {} : Hash from ( irb ) :1 >> proc {}. c[ TAB ] }.call }.class }.clear }.clone }.collect
If you take a look at the implementation , both Hash and Proc methods are added together in one completion case .
This is n’t a big deal as long as you do n’t mind the occasional misleading completion .
Bond ’s take on this :
>> {}.c }.class }.clear }.clone }.collect >> proc {}.c }.call }.class }.clone
Next up is completion for nil , false , true and Range objects .
Irb ?
# I did n't know nil had so many methods >> nil . [ TAB ] Display all 496 possibilities ?
( y or n ) #
Or false and true for that matter >> false . [ TAB ] Display all 496 possibilities ?
( y or n ) >> true . [ TAB ] Display all 496 possibilities ?
( y or n ) #
Turns out we are using the default method completer >> self . [ TAB ] Display all 496 possibilities ?
( y or n ) #
What say you monsieur range ? >> ( 1..10 ) . [ TAB ] # Nothing happens
The first three cases are all the same .
Irb does n’t have explicit completion cases for them and thus defaults to completing self .
The last case is a little different .
The object has a period which irb ’s default method completer does n’t allow .
So , sorry range objects , no completions for you .
Bond ’s take on all of this : just do the right thing for all cases .
Last up and personally the biggest deal is completion of method chains .
Irb does something funky :
>> ' man'.to_sym.[ TAB ]
Display all 496 possibilities ?
( y or n ) >> ' man'.to_sym.s[ TAB ] .to_sym.safe_level .to_sym.setuid ?
.to_sym.slice !
.to_sym.status .to_sym.string .to_sym.swapcase .to_sym.save_history= .to_sym.shift .to_sym.socket ?
.to_sym.step .to_sym.strip .to_sym.swapcase !
.to_sym.scan .to_sym.signaled ?
.to_sym.sort .to_sym.sticky ?
.to_sym.strip !
.to_sym.symlink ?
.to_sym.sec .to_sym.signm .to_sym.sort!
.to_sym.stime .to_sym.sub .to_sym.sync .to_sym.seek .to_sym.signo .to_sym.sort_by .to_sym.stime= .to_sym.sub!
.to_sym.sync= .to_sym.select .to_sym.singleton_method_added .to_sym.source .to_sym.stop ?
.to_sym.succ .to_sym.sysread .to_sym.send .to_sym.singleton_methods .to_sym.split .to_sym.stopped ?
.to_sym.succ!
.to_sym.sysseek .to_sym.set_backtrace .to_sym.size .to_sym.squeeze .to_sym.stopsig .to_sym.success ?
.to_sym.syswrite .to_sym.set_last_value .to_sym.size ?
.to_sym.squeeze!
.to_sym.store .to_sym.sum .to_sym.setgid ?
.to_sym.slice .to_sym.stat .to_sym.strftime .to_sym.superclass
Ok ?
I know plenty of those are n’t symbol methods .
If you look at the source , you ’ll see that irb handle ’s method chaining by iterating over all possible methods and giving you back a little more than you asked for .
As a side note , this kind of throw - all - known - methods - at - you completion can be a performance issue .
For example , a Rails environment gives me 4902 completions for this .
Personally , I ’d like to get back completions on the current object in a chain of methods .
Bond ?
>> ' man'.to_sym.s .to_sym.send .to_sym.singleton_methods #
It does n't matter how much chaining we do , Bond returns the correct method completions for the current object . >>
' man'.to_sym.to_s.to_a.se .to_sym.to_s.to_a.select .to_sym.to_s.to_a.send
Bringing a Knife to a Gun Fight
So why does irb have the above inconsistencies ?
Well , if completion were a gun fight , irb is bringing the knife .
Irb completes all of its cases only knowing the last word typed .
Meanwhile , Bond is packing access to the full line typed .
Having this allows
Bond to know exactly what any object is and completes its methods .
What does it mean for irb to only know the last word ?
Since a word is defined by Readline as any string not containing these characters \s\t
\ " \\'` ><=; |&{( , it means there are cases where irb does n’t know the object it ’s completing on :
# Irb 's completion only knows what 's after { >> {:a=>{:a=> 1}}. [ TAB ] Display all 496 possibilities ?
( y or n ) #
Irb 's completion only knows what 's after ( >> ( [ 1 ] + [ 2 ] ) . [ TAB ] Display all 496 possibilities ?
( y or n )

MOSCOW --
For a decade , Russian academic Igor Panarin has been predicting the U.S. will fall apart in 2010 .
For most of that time , he admits , few took his argument -- that an economic and moral collapse will trigger a civil war and the eventual breakup of the U.S. -- very seriously .
Now he 's found an eager audience : Russian state media .
In recent weeks , he 's been interviewed as much as twice a day about his predictions .
" It 's a record , " says Prof. Panarin .
" But I think the attention is going to grow even stronger . "

Searching for instructions and opcodes is a basic necessity for security researchers , therefore to address this issue IDA Pro provides many search facilities , among them we list :
Text search :
Used to search the listing for text patterns ( regular expressions are allowed ) .
One can write a regular expression to find any assignment to the eax register ( with the mov instruction )
instruction )
Binary search : Allows you to search for binary patterns with wildcard support .
It is also possible to search for strings alongside with the binary patterns .
Immediate search : Very useful to find constants and magic numbers used in the program .
Please refer to the search menu for other search facilities
None of the existing search facilities allow us to readily search for instructions and opcodes .
In order to do that , one has to assemble the instruction in question then use the Binary Search to find the pattern .
Each processor module in IDA can implement the assemble notification callback :
assemble , // Assemble an instruction // ( display a warning if an error is found ) // args : // ea_t ea - linear address of instruction // ea_t cs - cs of instruction // ea_t ip - ip of instruction // bool use32 - is 32 bit segment ? // const char * line - line to assemble // uchar * bin - pointer to output opcode buffer // returns size of the instruction in bytes
Once this callback is implemented by the processor module one can then assemble instructions by calling the ph.notify ( ) with the assemble notification code ( please check this forum discussion here ) .
Currently , only the pc processor module implements this callback and provides a very basic assembler .
We wrote a script that allows you to search for opcodes and assembly statements , so for example to find the “ 33 c0 ” ( xor eax , eax ) , followed by “ pop ebp ” and followed by “ ret ” we could search like this :
find ( " 33 c0 ; pop ebp;ret " )
That ’s the script operation in brief :
Do some input initial validation Split the patterns Loop : Determine if the pattern is an assembly instruction or opcode list ( using a simple regular expression )
If pattern is an instruction then assemble it Accumulate the assembled ( or converted opcodes ) into a single buffer Now that we have one single binary buffer we can search for it with FindBinary ( )
Display the result
The script uses the Assemble ( ) function ( available in IdaPython r233 and above ) .

Al - Qaeda loyalists in Gaza declared war on Hamas Saturday after violent shootouts left 24 people dead , including Jund Ansar Allah leader Abdel - Latif Moussa .
Report Hamas : Leader of al - Qaeda - inspired group committed suicide Associated Press Strip 's interior ministry says Abdel - Latif Moussa , leader of group seeking to enforce stricter version of Islamic law , blew himself up in a shootout with Hamas that killed 24 people , injured 150 in Rafah Hamas : Leader of al - Qaeda - inspired group committed suicide
The group warned residents of the Gaza Strip to stay away from government ministries and Hamas security offices .
" We call on our people to stay away from mosques attended by leaders of the infidels Ismail Haniyeh and the ministers and legislators of his government , who legislate against the will of Allah , " the message added .
Palestinian residents of Gaza were also called upon to " stay away from the area of the legislative council and especially the military courts " .
The group also vowed to remain loyal to the leader who would replace Moussa as head of the Islamic emirate he declared Gaza to be before the fighting ensued and he was killed .
According to Hamas the hardline leader detonated an explosive device he was wearing during the conflict and blew himself up .
Other hardline groups whose members have been hunted down by Hamas recently have also sworn revenge against the organization .
One such group , the ' Army of the Supporters of Allah ' , has announced that a cell of 30 gunmen would soon avenge the killing of its members by Hamas over the weekend .

Well , the Summer of Mailbag turned out to be as memorable as the Summer of George .
What happened ?
In the words of Mark McGwire , I 'm not here to talk about the past .
Especially a past that contains broken promises and erratic writing .
Let 's just get to the mailbag .
As always , these are actual e-mails from actual readers .
Q : What happened to the Summer of Mailbag ???
I hate you .
Seriously .
-- Mark , Walpole , Mass .
SG : Give me one more chance and 7,000 words .
There 's still time .
We can work this out .
By the end of this column , you 'll only partially loathe me .
Q : I am a big fan of your idea of " Press Box Hot " in which any remotely attractive woman instantly becomes a supermodel when she walks into the press box .
While in summer school this week , I realized this also applies to the awful classrooms in August full of dudes and freaky chicks .
It made me think of other places where " Press Box Hot " comes into play like church , sports collector conventions and Star Wars premieres .
Any others ?
-- Evan , Hope Valley , R.I .

What 's more dangerous for Danica : Riding in an open - top car at over 200 mph or agreeing to this photo ?
SG : You forgot Seedy Strip Joint Hot ; Female Blackjack Dealer Hot ; Women 's Professional Athlete Hot ( Danica Patrick and Jennie Finch are undeniably cute , but stick them in the sports world and they suddenly become Victoria 's Secret models ) ; American Gladiators Hot ; ' 80s Movies Hot ; Cleaning Lady
Hot ( we all have at least one friend who talked themselves into an older cleaning lady once and had his way with her , and if you do n't have this friend , that means YOU were the friend ) ; Nanny Hot ; Sports Bar Waitress Hot ( the Carla Tortelli complex ) ; Wedding Hot ; Female Musician
Hot ( which is what makes the bassist for Stellastarr * so hot , because she'd be hot anyway , but as a bassist in an indie band , she 's jaw - droppingly , stupefyingly hot ) ; Hip Hop Backup Singer Hot ; Beach Around 3 p.m. When You 're Overheated & A Little Punchy Hot ; Pregnant
Hot ( you 're damned right I went there ) ; Goth Hot ; Tattooed Hot ; and my personal favorite , ' 80s Female Pro Wresting Hot .
Explanation for the last one :
When I was 14 , along with everyone else in my age range , I absolutely believed that ( A ) Wendi Richter was super - attractive , ( B ) Miss Elizabeth was n't just beautiful , but classier than Princess Di or Nancy Reagan , and ( C ) I would sacrifice 10 solid years off the tail end of my life to see Missy Hyatt naked for 10 seconds .
As far as I can tell , that 's the widest swing between " actual attractiveness " and " perceived attractiveness , " which is why ' 80s Female Pro Wrestling
Hot tops everything else , including Press Box Hot and Sports Collector Convention Hot .
I 'm glad I 'm here .
Q : Is there any way you could provide a larger , higher resolution version of your picture ?
I 'd really like to Photoshop all the film credits around it so it looks even more like Steve Carell 's picture on the " The 40 Year Old Virgin " poster .
I mean really , the lighting is perfect .

SG : Yup , even people in India are making fun of my new ESPN.com photo .
Q : Thanks for the post - Collector 's Convention picture at the airport .
You look like a bowl of oatmeal .

SG : And people in Alabama are making fun of my pasty skin .
This is great .
No wonder I cut the Summer of Mailbag short .
Q : You do n't like soccer .
You are just bored because the Sox are n't that good , and football has n't started .
Also , you are trying to see if you can be influential enough to make other people like soccer .
You can 't .
Stop .
Write a mailbag .
-- Chris , Wilmington , Del .
SG : What do you think I 'm doing ?
By the way , " you 're just trying to see if you can be influential enough to make other people like soccer " is my second favorite conspiracy about my summer crush on soccer behind " you 're only writing about soccer because ESPN made you because they invested so much money in the World Cup . "
It 's always funny when people think ESPN operates like the Nixon White House .
In fact , I e-mailed these theories to John Skipper , the guy in charge of all creative content for ESPN , and here 's how he responded :
" Do you still work for us ? "
So ... um ... yeah .
Q : Just finished " Cast Away " for the second time .
Let 's say this actually happened : plane crash , lone survivor etc .
I live for 5 years on an island and I finally get rescued ... then what ?
Book deal ... overnight millionaire .
Bidding war between the major studios as to who gets the movie rights .
Massive attention from the fairer sex .
( Even Luke and Sasha would be fighting for my crumbs .
I 'm 25 now , in my high school there were about 900 girls .
In my university there were about 3,000 .
Lets add another 300 random acquaintances through work , friends , the gym etc etc .
So I would be looking at 4,200 gals right there .
Then you can probably triple that number once each girl heard I was alive and tells two of her friends about some random story where I did something funny , cool , dumb ... whatever it does n't matter .
So right away your talking about 12,600 girls and that is not even considering the amount from just having your story on TV .
Lets say 10 % are hot , I would have 1,260 women who would probably jump in the sack with me without even thinking .
I would have enough one - nighters for three years .
Perhaps Hollinger could work out a formula called ONWWWTYWDPYOD or " One Nighters With Women Who Though You Were Dead Per Years Of Desertion . " )
And you know " Survivor " would do their next season on my island , with me being a guest host / analyst .
Just me and Probst kicking on my island ... for the record I think it would be only fair that they name it after me .
That 's really as far as I can get , a testament to me being 25 perhaps .
But what else would happen once I got home ?
-- Ryan Harris , Kelowna , B.C .

While the ladies may have lined up for some Tom Hanks love , Helen took a pass .
SG : From what you just described , I 'd throw this in : syphilis , drug rehab , Oprah and more syphilis .
Then you 'd replace TJ Lavin as the new host of the " Real World / Road Rules Challenge , " and you 'd kill it to the point that , yes , you 'd get more syphilis .
And finally , you 'd marry the wrong girl and she'd take half your money , but not before she sued you for giving her syphilis .
My advice would be ... wait a second , why am I thinking about this ?
Q : I work as a waiter .
At work today , a table of a friend of mine ordered an Arnold Palmer ( iced tea and lemonade , for those readers who do n't know ) with a double shot of vodka .
Having never heard of this before , three of us on the wait staff deliberated and decided that this drink should forever be known as a John Daly .
Any objections ?
-- Colin , Oshkosh , Wis .
SG : None .
I love it .
That 's the best sports - related drink idea since the LeBomb James ( pouring 3 packs of Splenda on your hands , dropping a shot of Crown Royal into a glass of Red Bull , chugging it down , then throwing the Splenda up in the air like baby powder ) .
The bigger question ...
Q : If there was a drink called the " Bill Simmons " what would it be ?
First off , we can ask girls at the bar , " Hey , Can I buy you a Bill Simmons ? " and of course " Hey who wants to buy the next round of Bill Simmons ? "
-- John T , Tempe , Ariz .
SG : My personal preference would be a high - quality tequila on the rocks with a lime .
So you 'd say to the bartender , " I 'd like a Bill Simmons " and they 'd respond , " What kind of tequila would you like ? " and then mention three of their high - end tequilas .
I always wanted to be named after a drink that led to a discussion of what high - end options were available in that specific liquor .
[+]
Enlarge Courtesy Partida Tequila
When in doubt , just stick with the high - end tequila .
It will never treat you wrong .
Of course , my sarcastic readers would follow that last paragraph up with a joke like , " You should be named after a drink that 's rarely available , only there 's always a mediocre substitute for it -- it would be like when you do podcasts over columns . "
And honestly ?
That hurts .
I just hurt my own feelings projecting your fake e-mails .
But if that 's your mindset , then the Bill Simmons drink should be a spicy Bloody Mary with high - quality vodka , three olives and extra horseradish .
Why ?
Because half the bars in America serve Bloody Marys without horseradish , which single - handedly defeats the purpose of drinking a Bloody Mary , because every Bloody Mary -- and I mean , EVERY Bloody Mary -- should have ridiculous , eye - watering amounts of horseradish in it or there is no conceivable way it can be a good Bloody Mary .
I am about 10 more times away from a waiter telling me that they do n't have horseradish but offering me Tabasco sauce instead , followed by me flipping over the table , throwing chairs around and ending up on The Smoking Gun ... which is probably how some of you feel when we post four BS Reports in a row without a new column .
So maybe that should be my drink .
I need to think about this some more .
Q : Saw your idea for a bachelor party from your Collector 's Convention column ( i.e. opening the sealed box of sports cards with 12 friends ) .
I am getting married next year and sent the idea to my brothers who are planning the party .
The response from my younger brother : " Five Better Things to do with $ 100 at a Bachelor Party then open up old baseball cards : 5 ) 100 $ 1 beers at happy hour ; 4 ) Splitting it in two and getting ( 2 ) Lap dances ; 3 ) $ 100 oral sex behind strip club ; 2 ) 1/8 of Cocaine ; and 1 ) 100 tacos . "

SG : Your brother is Corey Haim ?
Can you ask him when Season 3 of the " Two Coreys " starts ?
Q : Seattle has a mayoral candidate named Jan Drago .
I am thinking of voting for her just based on her name or the chance that , when debating the city 's proposed plastic bag tax / fee ( which she is against ) , she will say " If it dies , it dies . "
Or should I read the voter pamphlet and make an informed decision ?
-- Dave S. , Seattle , Wash .
SG : I received this e-mail before Jan Drago failed to make the final three for November 's election , which raises the question , how could you not vote for Mayor Drago ???
You know how many of us would kill to have a Mayor Drago so we could make " I can't get over the size of this mayoral candidate ! ' and " What started out as a joke of an election has turned into a disaster " jokes ?
The only way I would n't vote for a Mayor Drago is if her opponent filmed a commercial in which they climbed a 20,000 - foot mountain in Russia wearing only a parka and running boots , then reached the top and screamed , " Draaaaa - gooooooooooooo ! Draaaaaaaaaa - goooooooooooo ! "
Actually , I 'd still vote for Mayor Drago .
And you know why ?
Because I vote for me .
I vote for me !!!!

No doubt Drago was done in by a " we all can change " speech at a debate .
( By the way , I just obliterated the record for most " Rocky IV " references crammed into a single paragraph .

Q : Do you think the economy will finally put an end to the travesty known as women 's professional sports ?
Yeah , I said it .
Deal with it .

SG : ( Afraid to say anything . )
Q : Looks like success is n't the only thing Rick Pitino is pro-choice about !
Thank you , thank you .

SG : ( Really super - afraid to say anything . )
Q : Do you think Alex Ovechkin pounds the headboard after sex like he pounds the glass after a goal ?
-- Justin , Lancaster , Penn .
SG : There 's no question .
You just made me think of something , though -- each sport has its own unique celebration to some degree .
Here they are :
Baseball : Walk - off hit followed by a circle with dudes jumping up and down in unison .
Football : Guy dances by himself as teammates watch him .
Basketball : Guy struts back up the court after a big shot , makes the Tony Montana " sticking out the lower jaw trying to look like a badass " face , preens for the crowd and eventually gets chest - bumped angrily by other people his size .
Hockey / soccer : Scorer gleefully skates / runs away from the goal and gets mobbed by teammates .
Golf : Awkward fist pump after a putt , followed by an extremely awkward high - five with a caddy .
Tennis :
Guy sinks to his knees like he 's absolutely incredulous ( even if he 's not ) .
Here 's my question :
Are we happy with these matches of sport and celebration ?
For instance , I 'd love to see baseball players adopt the tennis celebration : hit a homer and just sink to your knees in complete shock for five seconds as everyone angrily stares at you .
Would n't it be more fun if the winning tennis player sprinted 40 yards like a soccer player and acted like a crazy person ?
What if a golfer and caddy did a two - man jump - up - and - down celebration like baseball players after a walk - off ?
Also , why are we so content with the celebrations we have ?
I love Ovechkin 's self - check into the boards .
It 's fantastic .
Why could n't someone like Chris Paul make a big shot , wait for the timeout , run over to the scorer 's table , then stage - dive into his sea of teammates like they 're a giant mosh pit ?
Why could n't a golfer hand his putter back to his caddy and his caddy could pretend to be electrocuted by it ?
Maybe the golfer could pretend that he's also being electrocuted , and they could stand there vibrating for a couple of seconds ?
We need more clever celebrations heading into this next decade .

Forget the shaving cream pie , the post walk - off handshake shows you 're classy .
That reminds me , my favorite moment of the 2009 Red Sox season happened after Big Papi 's walk - off homer at Fenway on Wednesday night -- Papi crossed home plate , everyone celebrated , then they started heading back to the dugout when new teammate and special handshake aficionado Victor Martinez suddenly came roaring in from behind -- seriously , he almost bowled Papi over -- to rope him into what could only be described as a " Our very special walk - off home run handshake that we 've been practicing for weeks and I can't believe you forgot about it ! " moment .
The handshake consisted of a couple of hand slaps , some elbow bumps , then what looked a little like the LeBron James baby powder throw , only they were doing it to each other .
Classic .
Maybe we should make Victor the Tsar of Celebrations .
Q : [ In your last mailbag ] you know how you were talking about what would possibly be the worst movie to make a sequel to ?
You missed the worst case scenario .
" Hoosiers II : Norman Dale Gets Married . "
-- Matthew , New Orleans , La .
SG : Excellent point .
I also missed " Jerry Maguire II : Jerry Becomes a Level 5 Thetan . "
Q : If Albert Pujols turned it on and made a run at 62 homers next month , should n't we offer him the same excitement and publicity that these cheaters like Bonds , McGwire and Sosa received when they made a similar run at Maris ?
I recommend a new " chasing history " update , what I need from you is to start it .
The number all clean players should be aiming for is 61 , not 73 .
I write this assuming Pujols is clean .
Boy I hope he 's clean .
-- Spartacus , San Antonio , Texas
SG : Me , too .
But I think the record is the record .
Babe Ruth struck 60 playing in an all - white league without blacks , Latinos or Asians .
Bob Gibson put up the 1.12 ERA before they lowered the mound .
Denny McLain won 30 games before everyone switched to a five - man starting staff .
Stuff happens .
Collectively , we have to come to grips with the fact that only 10 individual baseball records matter anymore : Joe D's 56 - game hitting streak ; Ted Williams being the last guy to hit .400 ; Orel Hershiser 's 59 - inning scoreless streak ; Pete Rose 's 4,256 hits ; Rickey Henderson 's 130 steals ; Nolan Ryan 's seven no-hitters and 5,174 strikeouts ; Johnny Vander Meer 's consecutive no-hitters , Cal Ripken 's Whatever He Ended Up At Streak , and Joe Torre 's streak of 1,397 consecutive games caught picking his nose by his dugout 's camera .
That 's it .
None of the other records either ( A ) can be broken , ( B ) matter in the first place , ( C ) will ever be looked at objectively because of who broke them ( and yes , I 'm including your 756th homer , A - Rod ) .
But we still have 10 records that matter .
And by the way , if someone even hints at approaching Bonds ' 73 by doing it naturally ... how great would that be ?
Something to root for .
Of course , it will probably turn out that the hitter who broke out was drinking hemoglobin from dead baby seals while illegally fighting panda bears ... but still .
Q : Have you ever tried out the carts at Ikea ?
All four wheels turn , and the floors have practically been buffed with a Zamboni .
I feel like Tony freakin Hawk hitting 720s in the pillow aisle .
This needs to be an X - Games event .
-- Brian , Eugene , Ore .
SG : You just broached on an idea that 's going to be the linchpin of my campaign to take over ESPN6 : The Self - Created Olympics .
For instance , Brian just created his own event -- the Ikea 200 - Meter Aisle Dash -- so we head down to an Ikea and he challenges the other customers to beat him in this event .
My event ( as I have mentioned many times ) would be a little like the Long Ball Golf Challenge , only it would be throwing tennis balls down a narrow sidewalk with those plastic tennis ball throwers that they sell in Petco .
Not to sound like Mayor Drago , but I can not be defeated in this event and I WOULD break you .
Everyone has one dumb fake sport that they excel in , right ?
It 's a great idea and I can't wait for Shaq to steal it and make me an executive producer well after the fact .
Q : What current NBA player would best fit in with the NBA drug era of the late - 70s ?
( Picking Ron Artest or the Birdman is prohibited )
-- Nick B. , Centreville , Va .
SG : I have been working on this mailbag off and on for two weeks .
It 's a long process that involves sorting through multiple word docs of questions , narrowing them down , printing them out , going to a coffee place , jotting down notes or possible riffs for each question , then proceeding with the process of actually writing the column .
On the printed out sheet , I jotted down the following two words next to this question : " Michael Beasley . "
Two weeks ago .
Hmmmmm .
Q : So me and about 15 buddies are taking a train down to Chicago to go watch a WNBA game between the Sky and the Mercury .
We need ideas for t- shirts because we plan on creating a scene ... so far a couple ideas are " Score three for feminism " and " 0.17 " in honor of Diana Taurasi .
We hope to make it until at least halftime before getting kicked out .
Maybe they 'll let us stay longer because they 'll set a new record for beer sales in a game because its the first time a group of college aged males ever went to a WNBA game .
Please help us out !!
-- Joel , Racine , Wis .
SG : Has n't the WNBA suffered enough ?
Come on , Joel .
Even I can't condone this behavior .
( Translation : DO IT !
DO IT !
Two other ideas for T - shirts : " EXPECT LAYUPS " or " We Got Next . .. to Fold After The AFL . "
Lemme know how it turns out . )
Q : Look I enjoy the soccer commentary and I really want to jump on the bandwagon but I just can't .
The reason , every soccer player I 've ever met is a total d-bag .
How can I like a sport where every person who plays it drinks flavored vodka and attempts to screw every girl who walks by ?
-- Ryan , Atlanta

Go ahead and rub this photo on your arms if you run out of whatever dude body spray you 're into .
SG : See , I think that 's what took me so long to gravitate towards soccer .
I have n't been in college since the early - '90s .
I have n't been single since the early - '00s .
I have n't seen soccer players disgracing themselves socially for such a long time that I now operate under the premise that they 're like everyone else .
Maybe that should be the new MLS PR strategy : targeting married guys over 35 with a slogan like " Professional Soccer : Because it 's been so long that you forgot they were d-bags . "
Q : I was recently waiting on line in the grocery store looking at magazine covers when I discovered that apparently Kelly Ripa has A -cups .
This brought to mind an intriguing question :
Who are the five hottest female celebrities without much up top ?
I did n't even know where to begin , but I knew you would deliver the goods for me .
Also , should we call them The A - Cup All - Stars , or perhaps just The A - Team ?
-- Vroom , Waldwick , N.J .
SG : I love " The A - Team . " Perfect .
Our 2009 A - Team All - Stars : Kelly Ripa , Kate Moss , Keira Knightley and team captain Natalie Portman .
This list should be released like the NFL All - Pro team every December .
I 'd also enjoy the B - Team , the C - Team , the D - Team and the DD - Team .
These are the kind of ideas that give me hope for the next decade with the Internet :
There are still a ton of great boob - related ideas out there .
Wait , am I saying this out loud ?
Q : In the spirit of " Athlete Funny , " how about a ratings system for " Celebrity Sports Smart . "
E.g. , Affleck appears to be a 10/10 when it comes to baseball , Seth Meyers seems like about an 8 , anybody on a Fox show that gets free tickets to the post - season is a - 10 .
-- Michael K. , Spokane , Wash .
SG : You could n't do a whole scale .
It comes down to six categories in descending order : ( 6 ) diehard , psychotic , over - the - top fan who flies to games and stuff ( Donnie Wahlberg with the Celtics is my favorite example ) ; ( 5 ) real fan who does n't make a huge deal out of it but knows everything that 's going on ; ( 4 ) real fan who incessantly has to make it clear to everyone that they 're a real fan and it almost seems like somewhat of a calculating choice to help their career ; ( 3 ) fake fan who pretends to have a clue but clearly does n't ; ( 2 ) no idea whatsoever ; and ( 1 ) Jimmy Fallon .
Just for fun , I thought I 'd ask Red Sox fan Ben Affleck ( who vacillates between Category 5 or Category 6 depending on how busy he is ) for his take on the whole thing .
Here 's what he wrote back :
My perspective on the celebrity as sports fan thing is that unless you are really , really into a team it does n't make sense to do the public " this is my sports identity " thing .
And I say this as someone who has gone through it .
The notion that people are posing when they display some team loyalty is rooted in the assumption that one has something to GAIN by being perceived as a fan of one team or another .
In my experience , that is n't necessarily the case .
People who like the same team you do will not feel any additional sense of solidarity with you .
Rather , they are inclined to believe they know more about the team , its history and have been " realer " fans for a longer period of time and thus deserve the great seats they see on television being squandered on the dilettante , celebrity .
Obviously , people who support rival teams ( Yankees fans , e.g. ) now view that celebrity as a legitimate target for hot dogs and urinal cakes .
So what do you profit by showing up in interviews with a jersey and a hat ?
Are people really all that impressed ?
No .
What 's to " pose ? "
Anyone can buy a hat .
It takes courage to stand up for what you believe in .
But I do n't think it " gets " you anywhere .
Courage is its own reward .
So is patience .
Go Red Sox .
Q : My buddy and I were talking the other day , and we came up upon the subject of women shaving their legs .
We decided that whoever started this brilliant tradition should be honored in some way .
We decided to start the Smartest People Ever Hall Of Fame .
Our first entry is the woman / person who came up with the idea for women to shave their legs .
Second entry : us for coming up with this idea .
Third : the guy who invented toilet paper .
Who do you think should be added to our Hall ?
-- Chris F. , Boston , Mass .

Hail to the razor and hail to the ladies who have embraced it .
SG : First , you have to explain why this differs from Bud Light 's " Real Men of Genius " campaign .
It 's basically the same thing .
So I 'm knocking you out of your own Hall of Fame for not acknowledging this .
With that said , maybe there should be a Real Men of Genius Hall of Fame .
Our first draft class could include , the guy who came up with the idea for women to shave their legs ; Danny Biasone ( the guy who invented the 24 - second shot clock in basketball ) ; the guys who invented aspirin , Halloween , the snooze button , the remote control , pizza and gambling .
That 's a killer first class .
And my friend Wildes thinks we should throw in the first guy who looked at a cow and said " F this , I 'm drinking that milk " in a fit of thirsty bestiality .
That 's a strong first class .
More importantly ... could n't you want to walk around a Hall of Fame like this for hours ?
Why does n't it exist ?
Why has n't Budweiser built a Real Men of Genius Hall of Fame in St. Louis ?
This would n't replace the Arch and Albert Pujols as the No. 1 attraction in that city ?
Q : According to Marquis Daniels ' Wikipedia page , his tattoos include " a caricature of a man blowing his head with a shotgun on his lower right arm , and Chinese characters on his other arm which were apparently intended to represent his initials , but translate to English as ' healthy woman roof . '
Where can I sign up for a " Healthy Woman Roof " C's jersey ?
-- Bardo , Lincoln , Maine
SG : And you wonder why I love the NBA so much .
Q : I just finished watching Tiger 's chip -in at the 2005 Masters for the 1,649th time , and I 've decided that it 's unequivocally the best YouTube clip of any sports moment ever .
Think about it .
First , the announcers set the scene , saying it 's the hardest chip on the course .
Then , the other announcer reminds us of Davis Love 's chip in 1999 , perfectly foreshadowing what comes next .
Tiger sets up the shot and the announcers doubt him , one of the worst mistakes a golf commentator could ever make .
Finally , he executes the shot perfectly .
The ball hangs on the lip of the cup , slowly drops in , and the announcers go nuts .
Then , in what may be the best part of the entire clip , Tiger and his caddy have one of the most awkward celebrations I have ever seen , totally missing their high five .
Perfect inadvertent comedy .
In just over two minutes , this clip has everything you could possibly want .
I guarantee you can't find a better one than this .
-- Jim R. , Milford , Conn .
SG : You make an incredible case .
It 's right there .
It has everything .
It 's a first - ballot Hall of Famer .
Still , it can't top the famous clip of the Edmonton Oilers fans singing " O Canada " before a 2006 playoff game , one game after Ducks fans booed the Canadian national anthem in Anaheim .
Name me another sports clip that can give you chills for over a minute straight .
You can't .
Q : I was thinking of how the steroid news stories were like the exact opposite of the popular saying " the gift that keeps on giving . "
I tried to think of what would be an appropriate tag which really covered how dreadfully awful this era has been for sports fans .
The fart that keeps on lingering ?
The annoying relative who keeps on inquiring about why you 're on your 5th year of college ?
The bag of feces that keeps on appearing at your doorstep ?
Help me out Simmons !
-- Sam H. , Glen Ridge , N.J .
SG : The automatic debit that can't be cancelled ?
The cold sore that keeps coming back ?
The Brett Favre press conference that keeps happening ?
Montezuma 's never - ending revenge ?
The dog poop that keeps getting stepped in ?
I gotta say .
..
I think I like Sam 's idea of " the fart that keeps on lingering " the most .
Perfect description of the steroids era .
Like being in a hot car with the windows rolled up and someone who just ate a bad enchilada .
Q : Welcome to the Tainted Sports Memory Club .
It 's nice to finally have you on board .
-- Steve C. , San Francisco , Calif .
SG : Get me out of the car !
It stinks like holy hell in here !

ROLL DOWN THE WINDOWS !!!
Q : Can we have a " signs of too much time at work " list ?
I 'd like to inaugurate it with " reading steve blake 's wikipedia . "
-- @sdotsom ( via Twitter )
SG : Very good start .
I 'd include these as well ...
1 . You did mock fantasy drafts in ESPN .
com 's mock draft lobby picking from every position 1 through 12 , just to " get a feel for how everyone else is thinking . "
2 . You send your friends e-mails with subject headings like , " Jeter HGH -- WOW ! " and " Have you seen the topless Scarlett Johansson photos ? " with tiny URL links that actually direct them to naked photos of dudes and it never stops being funny to you .
[+]
Enlarge Elsa / Getty Images
Don't worry , the Page 2 editors took out the photo link the Sports Guy tried to put in here .
3 . You spent 20 minutes looking for the most horrifying photo of a naked guy for the above reason .
4 . You have a Google alert for your own name even though you 're not a celebrity .
5 . You change your Facebook / Twitter photos every few days to " mix it up . "
6 . When your company once banned certain Web sites from being surfed at work , you reacted like a cross between Norma Rae and Karen Silkwood as people wondered , " Wait , why is he / she taking this so personally ? "
7 . You go outside with co-workers for their cigarette breaks even if you do n't smoke .
8 . You 're running your office 's pools for NFL Picks , NFL suicide , March Madness , the Oscars , the Emmys , the Royal Rumble and the AVN Awards .
9 . You heard that this mailbag was up , then wrote into your work planner for today , " 2:00 - 2:15 : Take a dump while reading new Simmons mailbag . "
10 .
You just read No. 9 on the bowl , laughed and talked yourself into the whole thing being a total coincidence .
Q : I am an engineer at GE Aviation .
What this means is that I help design aircraft engines , engines that power many of the aircrafts that you may fly on .
This means you are at my mercy .
Luckily , the most powerful motivating factor in my job is that I do not want to screw up and have something happen to an airplane that YOU are on .
What would I do without Bill Simmons 's mailbags ?
I think this dedication to keeping you safe deserves a shoutout to all engineers in your next mailbag .
Thanks .
PS : I sent a similar note to John Madden once , and that is the main reason he does not fly to this day ...
-- Mike , Cincinnati , Ohio
SG : OK , that was reason No. 11 .
Q : Can we put something in his contract where Tank Johnson would be obligated to play for whatever team is filming Hard Knocks for the season ?
It 's his second time around on the show , and I am still mesmerized watching Tank do normal everyday human things , like talking to his teammates or assembling a bunk bed for his daughters .
-- Mark Mayhugh , Fairfax , Va .
SG : I could n't agree more .
I would absolutely watch " Tyler Perry Presents The Tank Johnson Family " on TBS every week .
Very funny .
Q : You know what we need from ESPN ?
We need on - air personalities to say " by the way " and " oh by the way " more .
Hearing it a dozen times per segment is just not enough for me .
I'VE GOT A FEVER !
AND THE ONLY CURE ... IS MORE " BY THE WAY " !
-- Jason N. , Anchorage , Alaska
SG : And oh by the way , here 's why that 's a great idea -- it would keep every one of my ESPN comrades from sounding like they drank from the same Kool - Aid keg at some top - secret 2 a.m. brainwash session in Bristol , which , by the way , we have never been able to confirm actually happens or not , because , oh by the way , I 've only been to Bristol twice in the past seven years , which , by the way , was not an accident because I am terrified of waking up in some walled room like one of the vacationers in " Hostel , " a movie that , oh by the way , has a ton of gratuitous nudity , which , oh by the way , is n't a bad thing .
By the way , let 's move on .
Q : Please , Please , Please ... for the love of God .
Do n't talk about , do n't even mention ( The Quarterback Who Shall Not Be Named ) in your next mailbag .
I can't take it .
You are my one outlet where I can go to escape the things I do n't want to face in this world , and this is definitely one of those things .
-- Trevor B. , Woodsville
SG : Kind of sad it 's gotten to this point , no ?
Q : We were discussing this at work , and we could n't come up a good answer .
Now that Michael Jackson is dead , who becomes the creepiest person alive ?
I voted for Al Davis , but I do n't think he is as recognizable to the general public .
-- Bill , Colorado Springs , Colo .
[+]
Enlarge AP Photo / Nick Ut Even if you hated all sea life you still would n't leave a goldfish with Phil Spector .
SG : Also , he 's not alive .
That 's another problem .
I judge the " creepiest person alive " question by five components :
First , are they persistently , ubiquitously , inexplicably , almost unfathomably creepy ?
Second , does that creepiness triple or quadruple in HD ?
Third , does their creepiness suck all forms of unintentional comedy out of them because you can't even enjoy their creepiness ?
Fourth , would you be terrified to leave one of your young kids with them ?
And fifth , if you were sitting in a steam room by yourself and they walked in , dropped a towel and sat naked five feet away from you , how alternately horrified and frightened would you be ?
Using this criteria , there 's only one answer : Phil Spector .
Q : I recently emailed you about me and buddies going to a game and heckling Diana Taurasi .
Well , we did it .
The Chicago Daily Herald focused on us for a good part of the article on the game and I thought you'd be interested .
-- Joel , Racine , Wis .
SG : See what happens when you expect great ?
Q : In light of John Hughes death ( one of my favorites of all time ) I ask you this obvious question about " Ferris Bueller 's Day Off " :
How is it possible to fit so much into roughly an eight hour span ?
-- Mike , Columbia , Mo .
SG : Glad you brought this up .
Four things amazed me after Hughes ' untimely passing .
First , I could n't believe how little I knew about him given he was one of the biggest influences of my formative years , and beyond that , I could n't believe how little thought I had given to him ( not only during that time , but after ) .
Second , I was shocked to find out that he wrote " Mr. Mom " and " Vacation . "
Either I knew this and forgot it , or I never knew it .
Third , if you were doing a 10 - round fantasy draft in which you could own the entire IMDB.com resume of any writer / director on DVD , John Hughes would go in the first round ... and I did n't realize this until after he died .
Fourth , it 's astonishing how completely he owned the ' 80s compared to anyone else .
When I think of a pure ' 80s movie , there 's a specific time range ( 1982 - 1987 ) , a specific bent ( teenagers are misunderstood and deeper than we think , adults are evil or nonexistent , rich people and school administrators irrevocably suck ) , a definitive musical feel ( ca n't be fully defined , but you know it when you hear it ) , a certain rewatchability ( good movies that gained steam culturally once they hit cable ) and had to resonate with people of that age range ( the future Generation X ) in a unique way .
Well , I was there .
I was John Hughes ' target audience : born in 1969 , weaned on pop culture , geeky and idealistic , loved music , thought way too much about stuff .
And really , if you stuck 20 DVDs in a time capsule as a way to explain to future generations , " This is what the ' 80s were like , " you 'd have to include these 15 movies : " Fast Times at Ridgemont High , " " Risky Business , " " Vacation , " " Sixteen Candles , " " Beverly Hills Cop , " " The Breakfast Club , " " Karate Kid , " " About Last Night , " " St. Elmo 's Fire , " " Ferris Bueller , " " Better Off Dead , " " Pretty in Pink , " " Ca n't Buy Me Love , " " Rocky IV " and " Top Gun . "
John Hughes was directly involved in five of the 15 .
This is amazing .
And it does n't even cover " Home Alone , " the greatest kids movie of all - time ( in my opinion , anyway ) .
In the last mailbag , I wrote how it 's so difficult for anyone to be overrated or underrated in this day and age .
But up until the moment he died , you could argue that Hughes was the single most underrated person in Hollywood .
I mean , I follow the movie world as diligently as anyone and was still learning things about him after he died .
I wish I had written about him before now , but honestly , it never occurred to me to do so .
Which is why he was so underrated .
OK , back to Mike 's " Ferris " question .
So many readers asked me this that I almost felt obligated to figure it out until I remembered something : Realistically , Ferris and Cameron did n't pick up Sloane until somewhere between 9:30 and 10:15 .
They lived at least 25 - 30 minutes from downtown Chicago and returned home at about 6 .
We know this because Sloane looked at her watch right near the end .
So that means in the span of slightly less than eight hours ...
[+]
Enlarge Courtesy Paramount Pictures " Cameron , how many miles did you say this thing had on it when we left ? "
They drove to Chicago ; dropped off the car ; visited the top of the Sears Tower as well the Stock Market ; went to the Museum of Art long enough for Cameron to have a life epiphany ; cabbed it over to the French restaurant ; ate lunch at Abe Froman 's table ; headed over to Wrigley Field ; attended an afternoon Cubs game long enough for the pizza guy to tell Ed Rooney that it was the third inning ( and for Ferris to catch a foul ball ) ; headed back to downtown Chicago ; took part in a parade in which Ferris sang " Danke Schoen " on a giant float without having rehearsed it ; picked up the car ; drove home ; hung out at Cameron 's pool ; spent at least 20 - 25 minutes trying to take the miles off Cameron 's car and watched Cameron subsequently destroy his father 's car and then tell them he'd take the heat for it ( which always bothered me because no father would forgive something that creepy , and besides , unless his father was molesting him , how bad could he have been that you 'd destroy a beautiful piece of machinery like that ? ) ; left Cameron 's house so Ferris could walk Sloane home ; then Ferris sprinted back to his house to make it in time for dinner .
Seems improbable , right ?
No way all of that stuff happens in less than 10 hours unless they basically made a two - inning cameo at the Cubs game and left .
( Conceivable , by the way .
How can you top catching a foul ball ?
And if Sloane hated baseball and pushed for them to leave after 2 - 3 innings , would n't the logical next stop for them -- if a girl who hated sports was running the show -- be that art museum ? )
But there 's no way to know , which leads me to the following idea : Should n't three Chicago kids re-enact Ferris ' entire day and see if they could pull it off in less than eight hours ?
Bring a couple of Flip cameras , tape everything , see if you can do it and stick the results on YouTube .
John Hughes would be proud .

This morning , my wife noticed a Google Adsense advert when she went to log into her online banking account this morning .
It was for the Reincarnation Bank .
What ?
Yes , the Reincarnation Bank .
Worried about how well off you will be in the next life ?
Just deposit money on a regular basis into an account you establish in the Reincarnation Bank – in Gibraltar [ chuckle ] – and it will be waiting for you when you return with your authorized spirit in a new persona – after reincarnation .
“ As in this life , in the next you will have memories of previous lives .
One of these recollections will be of your arrangement with Reincarnation Bank .
Whatever version of the internet or data retrieval mechanisms in use at the time of your return , you will renew your contact with Reincarnation Bank and through regression you will recall the details / instructions that you left at the time of making your deposit .
A custodian of Reincarnation Bank will open your letter privately in your presence and will ask you to repeat the details contained therein ( whilst in regression ) .
Once this has been satisfactorily achieved , funds / property will be handed back to you and the account closed . ”
Got that ?

The upward growth of mankind has been marked by the extinction of countless other species that got in our way , from the mammoths were were too tasty for their own good , to all the animals dumb enough to live where supertankers ply .

6 Guajon : The Frog Too Horrifying To Live Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Also known as " Cook 's Robber Frog " and the slightly unfair " Demon of Puerto Rico , " the guajon are small cave dwelling frogs .

AAAAAAAAHHHHHHHH !!!!!
Wait ,
What ?!
Yes , in Puerto Rico , an innocuous two inch - long frog is being killed because they think it 's kinda scary looking , believing that one look from the frog can bring down destruction and doom .
So far , no one knows if Puerto Ricans have found anything peculiar in the fact that the creature they 're so terrified of is also so easily defeated , but the smart money says that , no , they have not .

5 The Manus Island Tree Snail Makes Great Earrings Continue Reading Below Advertisement
Of all the things to hunt to extinction , why snails ?
Sure , some people eat them , but it 's not like people are ordering super - sized boxes of them at fast food chains .
And it 's not like they 're causing much of a threat or anything ; their most dangerous activities are " hiding in cracks if the weather 's too dry " and " trying not to drown . "
And while these creatures are partially threatened for the standard reasons ( that is , chopping down the forest that the snails call home ) there is another , far more ridiculous reason :
The booming market for people who want overpriced snail jewelry .
Ironic jewelery for hippies .

What ?!
Yes , even though through most of history snails on a woman was a sign of poor hygiene , these days there 's a demand for bling made from the brilliant green shells the snails are living in .
Thus , now you find Manus Island locals making a living off of killing and selling these creatures .
Non-Evil Solution : Boy , this is a tough one .
After all , the dazzling colors of the shells really can't be imitated .

It can't really be that hard ; go to the beach , pick up shells , paint them green .
Or use green rocks , like emeralds .

Anglo - Saxon treasure trove unearthed
An unemployed British man has unearthed the biggest hoard of Anglo - Saxon gold and silver ever found in a country field , according to archaeologists .
The trove of at least 1,350 items , including five kilograms of gold and a smaller amount of silver , was found in July by 55 year old Terry Herbert with a metal detector near his home in Burntwood , central England .
The haul , potentially worth a fortune of which Herbert will get half , was officially declared treasure on Thursday by a coroner , who under English law decides the status of such finds .
It is believed to date from the seventh century AD , and may have belonged to Saxon royalty .
The treasure includes sword pommel caps and hilt plates , many inlaid with precious stones .
" This is absolutely phenomenal .
When I first saw the material I was absolutely staggered , " says Duncan Slarke , finds liaison officer for the county of Staffordshire , who was the first professional to see the hoard .
" To see the volume and the quality of this Anglo - Saxon precious metalwork was absolutely stunning and I was literally speechless . "
Presenting the find at a press conference at Birmingham Museum and Art Gallery , archaeologist Kevin Leahy says none of the experts involved had seen anything like it before .
" These are the best craftsmen the Anglo - Saxons have got , working with the best materials , and producing incredible results , " he says .
' Spirits of yesteryear '
Herbert , who spent five days digging up treasure before calling in expert archaeologists , described the day he made the find , including a spooky detail before he set out for his day 's detecting .
" I have this phrase that I say sometimes ; ' spirits of yesteryear take me where the coins appear ' , but on that day I changed coins to gold , " says Herbert , who took up metal detecting as a hobby 18 years ago .
" I do n't know why I said it that day , but I think somebody was listening and directed me to it ...
This is what metal detectorists dream of , finding stuff like this .
But the vast amount there is is just unbelievable . "
After five days scouring the field with his trusty 14 year old detector , and digging up ever more treasure , his emotions turned to fear at the scale of his find , so he eventually called in the experts .
" I was excited when I started digging up the gold , but it was frightening in the end .
I was getting frightened about other people getting onto the field , night hawkers , " he says .
" It was like a burden on my shoulders , it became a worry . "
Luck and persistence
The treasures were found surprisingly close to the surface : some at such a shallow depth that they appeared to have been struck by a plough , in an area about 20 metres long in a cultivated field .
" I think what happened was that the plough just nicked the top of the deposit , " says Roger Bland , the Head of Portable Antiquities and Treasure at the British Museum .
" I think if it had come back again the next year we would have seen quite a bit of damage . "
While the value of the treasures has not yet been decided , it will likely make Herbert a rich man .
He is expected to share the money with the farmer in whose field it was discovered .
" It 's been more fun than winning the lottery , " he says .
" People laugh at metal detectorists .
I 've had people go past and go ' beep beep , he 's after pennies ' .
" Well no , we are out there to find this kind of stuff and it is out there . "
One expert told him it was like finding Tutankhamen 's tomb .
" I just flushed all over when he said that .
The hairs on the back of my neck stood up , you just never expect this . "
A lot of the problems in the world for the last 90 years can be traced back to one document – The Treaty of Versailles .
Written in 1919 and never approved by the US , the document set in motion a series of problems that have plagued the world ever since .
Many problems could have been avoided had Woodrow Wilson had his way at the conference , but no , Clemenceau and David Lloyd George got their revenge on Germany , Austria - Hungary , and the Ottoman Empire and the world has been paying for the document ever since .
What problems has the document caused ?
What has n’t it caused should be the question .
1. World War II – the treaty itself blamed Germany for the war , took away German lands , heaped reparations on Germany which helped sink the world into a depression 10 years after the war , created new countries in Europe without regards to ethnicity , religion , or resources , and gave Hitler the foundation on which he built his Nazi Party and the Holocaust .
As a result of Versailles , World War I would have its sequel in 20 years .
The League of Nations , envisioned by Wilson to stop wars , was powerless without the US who refused to approve the treaty at the behest of Henry Cabot Lodge and his Lodge Reservations .
2. Asia – A young Ho Chi Minh walked up to Woodrow Wilson at the conference and handed him a document which read :
We hold these truths to be self - evident that all men are created equal , that they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable rights , that among these are life , liberty , and the pursuit of happiness .
Yes , my friends , it is the Declaration of Independence .
Ho Chi Minh believed in the Declaration and wanted Wilson ’s mantra of self - determination to be applied to his people .
He wanted to free his people from the yolk of Imperialist France and guide a new path to democracy .
Unfortunately , Wilson only believed self - determination applied to European peoples .
It was a gigantic oversight .
One in which we can sit back and say that three wars ( WWII and 2 conflicts in Vietnam ) could have been avoided in the Big 4 of Versailles had not been thinking of only themselves .
3. Africa –
This continent is messed up even today .
A lot of it has to do with the Berlin Conference where a map was taken out and the nations of Europe divided up the continent .
Well , during Versailles , nothing much changed as resources had more value than people .
The Imperials , almost bankrupt from four years of war , hung on to their African possessions only to begin to give them up in the 50s and 60s .
4 . The Balkans – The powder keg that started the war would erupt in the 1980s when strong man Tito passed away .
As a ruler , he had kept the Serbs , Croats , Slovenians , Macedonians , and Montenegrens from killing each other .
after his death , they got right back to their old ways .
Now , thankfully , each has their own nation , but the thousands that died in the 80s and 90s may not have died had the Versailles treaty done its thing .
5 . The Middle East – No place is more messed up because of the Versailles treaty than the Middle East .
A map was made of British and French mandates without regards to ethnic groups , religion , or resources .
You have Sunni , Shias , and Kurds living in one country .
You have Pashtun , Hazara , Uzbek , Turkmen , Aimak , and a dozen others all living in Afghanistan .
Then there is the India which would later be partitioned after World War II into India , Pakistan , and a few others nations .
It is just a down right mess .
The Versailles Peace Treaty is the perfect example of how not to secure a just a lasting peace .
Had the Big 4 used and applied Wilson ’s 14 points to the entire world , we may not have a lot of the problems we have had since , and problems we have now .
Renewable Energy Accounts for 13 % of U.S. Electricity by April 2009
July 17th , 2009 by Susan Kraemer
[ social_buttons ]
Renewable sources of energy are beginning to replace coal power in the U.S. :
Every year the percentage of U.S. electricity generated from renewables has been increasing , according to the latest figures released by the Energy Information Administration in its Electric Power Monthly report .
As a result , by April of 2009 , the total was 12.97 percent , with hydropower accounting for 8.73 percent and other renewables like solar and wind 4.24 percent of all U.S. electricity on average among all the states .
Higher wind generation totals in just 4 states accounted for 62.2 percent of the national increase in wind powered generation : Texas , Iowa , New York , and Indiana .
By contrast the percentage of electricity from fossil power is now actually decreasing .
Comparing April 2008 to April 2009 , coal - fired generation fell by 20,551 thousand megawatt - hours , or 13.9 percent .
Declines in 7 states accounted for 52.3 percent of the national decrease in coal - fired generation : they were Alabama , Georgia , Ohio , North Carolina , West Virginia , Wisconsin , and Texas .
Net generation from wind sources was 34.8 percent higher than April 2008 .
Generation from conventional hydroelectric sources had the largest absolute increase in April 2009 as it was up by 3,918 thousand megawatt - hours , or up 18.4 percent from April 2008 .
Interestingly , efficiency or conservation also appears to have increased :
Net electricity generation dropped by 5.0 percent from April 2008 to April 2009 .
This was the ninth consecutive month that net generation was down compared to the same calendar month in the prior year .
( Or perhaps that drop was the result of idled factory production since the EconoApocalypse last fall . )

forgetters is a Brooklyn - based , three - piece noise / folk / death / dance / soul band .
We have one full - length LP / CD and a double 7 " from back in the day .
Be cool .
The idea that the U.S. must fight in Afghanistan is buttressed by an all - too - familiar theme , whether it be uttered on the Left ( Obama ) or the neocon Right ( Bill Kristol ) : the former says we must fight to prevent al - Qaeda from reestablishing " safe havens " so they ca n’t plot another 9/11 , while the latter echoes this nonsense in a column attacking George Will ’s call for the U.S. to get out of Afghanistan by referencing " the area that was the staging ground for Sept. 11 " and describing the Taliban as " the group that hosted the Sept. 11 attackers . "
It ’s ironic – but typical of neoconservative Bizarro logic – that Kristol would dismiss Will ’s call as based purely on " sentiment , " yet so brazenly " wave the bloody shirt " ( as he accuses Will of doing ) in support of a losing , futile , and increasingly costly war .
But that ’s the Kristolian method , after all , and we ought to be used to it by now .
Yet the notion of al - Qaeda ’s apparent omnipresence in the mountains of the Hindu Kush is flatly contradicted by U.S. Afghan commander Gen.
Stanley McChrystal ’s top adviser , Stephen Biddle , who , in an essay for The American Interest , averred that this actually is n’t about Afghanistan : it ’s really all about Pakistan , which would be in some danger of falling into terrorist hands if we do n’t stay the course in Afghanistan .
Yet even Biddle admits the danger of Pakistan falling into al - Qaeda ’s hands is small , and that it would take a series of major destabilizing events – the downfall of the Karzai regime in Afghanistan , the collapse of Pakistan ’s " democratic " government , the victory of an Islamist insurgency and its installation in Islamabad , and the seizure of Pakistan ’s nuclear arsenal by al - Qaeda ’s allies – before the worst - case scenario would occur .
Oh , yeah , and by the way , even if we do manage to succeed in Afghanistan – defend the fragile Afghan government , hold off the Taliban , and engage is some pseudo - successful nation - building – according to Prof .
Biddle there is " no guarantee " Pakistan wo n’t fall on its own , anyway .
We ca n’t get out of Afghanistan , because Pakistan will fall , and vice versa .
But each may fall on its own .
What kind of a shell game are war supporters playing ?
And what , by the way , are we fighting for ?
No one seems to know : or , more accurately , no one dares say what it ’s really all about – revenge .
It ’s a war that has nothing to do with protecting America from another 9/11 , and everything to do with institutionalizing an endless war of aggression the aim of which is slaughter for its own sake , as an end in itself .
Vengeance , not prevention , is what all the references to 9/11 are about , because that is the only way we can justify our policy of perpetual warfare in the eyes of the American people .
A 20 - page piece on COIN doctrine in the pages of Policy Wonk Journal goes right over their heads , but vengeance – now that they can understand .
Yet if anyone is getting revenge on account of the " Af - Pak " war , it is the other side .
The Taliban is resisting all efforts to tame the territory outside of the capital city of Kabul and making us pay an outsized , sharply rising price for whatever anemic " successes " we can credibly claim .
Kristol says
Will is " urging retreat , and accepting defeat , " but America ’s last Tory is merely pointing out that our defeat is already an accomplished fact and retreat the only rational option .
What it boils down to is this : the U.S. cannot prop up corrupt regional satraps without popular support and legitimacy , both of which are sadly lacking in Kabul and Islamabad .
So unless we can mobilize an army of at least a million soldiers – after all , we ’re talking about two massive nation - building exercises – what we have to look forward to is nothing more nor less than defeat .
This evolving meme – that the Afghan occupation is all about saving Pakistan ’s nukes from falling into Osama bin Laden ’s hands – is based on fantasy , not reality .
Sure , anything could happen , but Pakistan – a modern nation in many respects , with five times the population of Afghanistan and an enormous middle class that is n’t about to live in a feudalistic theocracy – is among the least likely to join OBL ’s projected global caliphate .
Another fantasy - based concept is the idea of fighting terrorism as if we were fighting , say , the Nazis , with continent - wide troop movements , massive air strikes , and a reenactment of the Normandy invasion – all of which are supremely irrelevant to the kind of asymmetric warfare that was visited on us that fateful day in September .
Bin Laden and his cohorts do n’t need any " safe havens " bigger than an apartment in Hamburg , Germany – or Florida – to plan the next 9/11 .
That ’s the essential weakness of the U.S. position in the " war on terror , " a battle in which our very bigness and alleged advantages – the complexity and relative freedom of our modern civilization – work against us .
The 9/11 hijackers integrated themselves seamlessly into our society and worked steadily and almost without detection toward their goal .
Our position , in short , is necessarily defensive .
The Bush administration tried to reverse this by adopting the old aphorism " the best defense is a good offense " as their strategic guiding principle , but it backfired badly – just as it will for the Obamaites , who are guilelessly pursuing the same generals - fighting - the - last - war game plan .
We have less to fear from Pakistan ’s nukes – which could n’t reach the U.S. anyway , in the highly unlikely event they fell into Islamist hands – than we do from a miniaturized nuke finding its way into the U.S. via our virtually open and defenseless ports , or from a " dirty bomb " being constructed right here in the U.S .
We spend billions to fight a war to keep al - Qaeda from coming over the Afghan - Pakistani border , but our own border with Mexico is notoriously porous , and only the gods know how many al - Qaeda have made it into America alongside your gardener and the guy who made that nice retaining wall in your backyard .
The lesson of 9/11 – and we ’ll be hearing a lot more about that subject as the anniversary approaches – is n’t that we must launch a global war of conquest aimed at every Muslim nation .
It is that we have to assume the enemy is already on our shores and well ensconced somewhere in the teeming American metropolis , lost in the crowds , waiting for the moment to strike .
We ca n’t in any way ameliorate that by invading and occupying foreign countries .
Indeed , such a policy only provides al - Qaeda & Co. with more foot soldiers in their war on the West .

Adrafinil Reviews - What Is It ?
WARNING : DO NOT BUY Adrafinil Until You Read This Review !
Is it a Scam ?
Does It Really Work ?
Check Ingredients , Side Effects and More !
Adrafinil is a eugeroic ( wakefulness - promoting ) or nootropic ( cognitive boosting ) drug .
It is also known as CRL - 40028 or Olmifron .
It is a precursor to Modafinil , a more commonly available variant of this medication .
Adrafinil and Modafinil are wake - promoting agents to treat narcolepsy .
Modafinil is a Schedule IV prescription drug in the USA , which means that it is illegal to use it without a doctor 's prescription .
Both drugs were banned by World Anti-Doping Agency ( WADA ) since 2004 because they were intensively used by in order to enhance their athletic performance .
Adrafinil is a pro-drug that is mainly metabolized in vivo to modafinil .
As a result , it has similar pharmacological effects .
But unlike Modafinil , it takes time for the metabolite to reach active levels in the blood flow .
You are expected to feel the effects within 45 - 60 minutes when taking it on an empty stomach .
Adrafinil is quite popular among nootropics enthusiasts .
The Reddit /r/ nootropics community includes more than 117,000 subscribers .
However , not all of the reviews are positive .
While some of them claim that it increases focus , others did not find it as effective saying that it did nothing for them .
The fact that it has not been approved by the FDA makes it difficult to say for sure whether it is the real deal .
But before we dive into the effects of Adrafinil more deeply , let us take a look at the company behind this product .
Well , the supplement was developed by the French pharmaceutical company called Lafon Laboratories .
It was in the 1970s , while the drug was introduced to the European market in 1986 under the brand name Olmifon .
Group Lafon was purchased by the U.S. - based pharmaceutical company called Cephalon in 2001 .
It is high time to study the ingredients in this central nervous system stimulant drug
Ingredients of Adrafinil - Does It Really Work ?
Is It a Scam ?
The official website of the drug claims that the product is able to relieve inattention and excessive sleepiness in elderly patients .
It can also be used by individuals who need to stay awake for a long period of time and avoid fatigue .
Some studies believe that the supplement " activates the noradrenergic and dopaminergic systems . "
The greatest drawback of the product is that it has no FDA approval at present and is not regulated in the USA .
It is known that it was marketed in Europe under the trade name Olmifon until 2011 , until France 's FDA equivalent withdrew the drug from the market .
The active ingredient in Adrafinil is Modafinil .
Thus , the product intends to increase the levels of Modafinil in the body .
Other ingredients include silicon dioxide , gelatin , magnesium stearate , and cellulose .
Adrafinil is a pro-drug activated to Modafinil .
It is claimed to enhance wakefulness increase energy levels , and to promote weight loss .
Generally , Modafinil is used to treat different disorders , as well as to boost cognitive functions .
This ingredient has been indirectly associated with weight loss , since it is said to suppress hunger and to decrease calorie intake , allowing you to decrease your weight with no need to exercise .
Adrafinil is never prescribed to people who need to lose weight because its ingredients do not speed up the process of burning body fat .
What Adrafinil does is increases the overall energy levels of the user keeping one energized and willing to work out .
The product promises that you will stay awake for a long period of time , so that you will be able to stay active longer , lose more calories and enough cook healthy meals .
However , these are just the manufacturer 's thoughts which can be quite opposite to reality .
Let us take a look at possible side effects of the supplement .
Customer Reviews - Does It Have Any Side Effects ?
The manufacturer mentions absolutely nothing about possible side effects of Adrafinil , but it does not mean that the drug is safe to use .
Based on customers ' reviews , the most common side effects of the product include diarrhea , trouble sleeping , dizziness , anxiety , lack of appetite , nausea , and headaches .
Less common side effects include mood changes , rapid heartbeat , low blood pressure , and high blood pressure .
Rare side effects may include rash , decreased white blood cells , abnormal liver function , hives , irritation , hyperactivity , and sweating .
If you cease using this drug , you may suffer from withdrawal symptoms ( sweating , shaking , chills , vomiting , nausea , confusion ) .
To avoid withdrawal , you are recommended to lower your dose slowly .
There is a great number of Adrafinil reviews on third - party websites such as nootropicsdepot.com , Amazon.ca , and the Adrafinil reddit pages .
While some people love the product , others have a lot of complaints ranging from and unpleasant urine odor to bad taste .
Let us take a look at some of the actual users ' testimonials .
" I am always up for some new stimulants .
After reading a few positive reports about Adrafinil , I decided to give it a try and ordered a box of 40 tablets .
After I consumed my first tablet I noticed getting slightly more alert .
I took another 300 mg the next day and I felt a slight headache .
A 200 mg dose of caffeine afterwards made me feel very jittery .
I stopped taking the product as I felt it caused me bad effects "
" I purchased adrafinil in hope that it would make me more productive .
Upon first taking it I felt more awake .
Over a few weeks I took the drug in various doses ( between 600 and 1200 mg ) but I did not experience any higher degree of alertness .
It affected me in a minor way .
It is certainly less powerful than a cup of strong coffee .
I will not buy it anymore "
" I tried Adrafinil to ease me off my medical prescription for ADD .
I really had an easy transition off of my prescription drugs , and the product improved my focus during the day to day at first .
But then I found out that I got addicted to this drug too .
I had unpleasant withdrawal symptoms which I hated .
If you are an addictive personality avoid this product "
Where To Buy Adrafinil ?
Before buying Adrafinil , make sure that it is legally approved in your country .
At present , it is legally accepted in the USA , Canada , Australia , and some countries in Europe .
The drug is not medically approved or regulated in some countries .
If you live in North America , you can buy the medication from online retailers like Walmart , Amazon , and GNC .
But European users will face some difficulties .
You will not be able to buy it from pharmaceutical stores .
You can buy Adrafinil on Absorb Health and Ceretropic .
Amazon sells 150 tablets of the drug for $ 125 .
My Final Summary
Adrafinil is associated with a number of disadvantages .
It could cause a number of serious side effects including liver issues .
Actually , there is a very long list of side effects .
The drug can imbalance your sleep to the point of insomnia .
The safety of the supplement is under question .
It is not regulated as a substance in the USA , so you never know what exactly you are buying .
It may be damaging to your health .
This product could potentially strain your heart .
Some users report that the drug fails to boost their concentration or cognitive abilities .
There is lack of research and science to back up the claims behind this product .
If you need to increase your wakefulness , boost concentration , and your energy levels , it is better to opt for a supplement that is backed up by the documented science and has lots of positive user reviews .
With all this in mind , Adrafinil cannot be recommended to usage .
Currently , Adrafinil cannot be recommended to usage .
Affordable Alternative
Adrafinil is not the best option for you to choose if you want to improve memory and support your health .
There are many other alternatives which use some other approaches towards the problem .
I study different products and I can say that one of them is worth your attention .
It is NooCube .
I recommend you reading my review about NooCube .
You will get hope for future with it !

Hugo Chavez denied claims that Venezuela sold arms to Farc rebels Venezuelan President Hugo Chavez has announced trade measures against Colombia , amid a growing diplomatic row between the two nations .
Mr Chavez said he would halt the import of 10,000 cars from Colombia and ban a Colombian energy firm from exploring Venezuela 's oil - rich Orinoco region .
Last week , Mr Chavez recalled his envoy from Bogota over accusations Venezuela had provided arms to Colombian rebels .
He is also angry at plans to allow US troops to use Colombian military bases .
Colombian President Alvaro Uribe is currently touring South America to try to reassure fellow leaders over the planned accord with Washington to allow US troops to use several bases .
A number of South American nations - including Argentina , Brazil and Bolivia - have expressed concerns over Bogota 's plans .
These bases could be the start of a war in South America - we 're talking about the Yankees , the most aggressive nation in human history
Hugo Chavez
Venezuelan President
Colombia 's rocky regional relations Uribe tours region over US pact However , Peru has expressed support for Mr Uribe , while Chile and Paraguay have said the accord is an internal matter for Colombia .
Washington wants use Colombia as a regional hub for operations to counter drug - trafficking and terrorism .
The US has been forced to look for a new location after the Ecuadorean government refused to renew the lease on its Manta base that the US military was using .
Speaking at a news conference in Caracas , Mr Chavez said the Venezuelan government would halt the import of 10,000 vehicles from neighbouring Colombia .
He also said Colombia 's Ecopetrol company would be barred from taking part in an auction to develop the heavy crude in Venezuela 's Orinoco region .
Mr Chavez went on to say Venezuela would seek to buy " several battalions of Russian tanks " during his visit to Russia in September .
" These bases could be the start of a war in South America , " Mr Chavez told reporters .
" We 're talking about the Yankees , the most aggressive nation in human history . "
Mr Chavez also rebuffed Bogota 's accusations that Caracas had given weapons to the left - wing Farc rebel group .
Alvaro Uribe is Washington 's main ally in the region
He said that rocket launchers and automatic rifles found in a Colombian rebel camp had been stolen from a Venezuelan naval post 14 years ago .
The Venezuelan leader identified a wide range of products that Venezuela imported from Colombia , including meat , dairy and cereals , saying he would be looking for other nations to do business with .
" We 're going to replace all of these imports .
" It 's our responsibility because at any stage Yankees could say ' send no more meat to Chavez ' or ' do n't send the Venezuelans ' , because it is the Yankees who are going to rule over there - not Uribe , " Mr Chavez said .
Colombia is a vital provider of food , plastic goods and automobiles to Venezuela , in exchange for gas from the Opec member , says the BBC's Will Grant in Caracas .
Bilateral trade between Venezuela and Colombia amounts to about $ 7bn ( £ 4bn ) a year , and some analysts suggest it will not be easy for Mr Chavez to replace it , he adds .
But our correspondent says that Mr Chavez remains adamant that it can be done , saying that Venezuela 's " trade with Colombia is n't indispensible " .
A close Chavez ally , Bolivian President Evo Morales , said on Wednesday that Washington was using Colombia 's Farc rebels as an excuse for military operations in the region .
" We can't have all these planes and military equipment concentrated in Colombia
This is n't against drug - trafficking , it 's against the region .
Our duty is to reject it , " said Mr Morales , a day after his meeting with Mr Uribe .

How often do you have to solve a small problem that is a part of a larger project and decide to take the time to perform some seperate experiments to solve the problem , before adding the partial solution to the whole ?
In the past , I hardly ever did that and everytime I encounter such a situation , I still have to resist the temptation to take the route thatto be the shortest , but that has long proven to be the longest road to the solution .
As an example , suppose you need to extract some information from a string and decide the best way is to use a regular expression .
You know that the problem is n't trivial and that you probably need a few attempts to get it right .
Still , your initial inclination is to just put the regex in there and go through the motions of compiling the code , performing the steps required to invoke the code ( click a button , enter some text , etc ) , find out that the regex does n't work , modify it and go through the motions again and again and again , probably while making some other modifications .
Because the cycles take relatively long , progress is slow and you start cursing every typo .
If you recognize this , then I think you can become faster and happier at your problem solving by reading on .
The advantage of the ' intuitive ' approach is that , if the solution is right , you have immediately come closer to solving the larger problem .
However , if the solution fails , the iterations to be informed of your failure and to verify subsequent modifications may soon take more time than developing a seperate solution to the subproblem would have taken .
For some reason , we always seem to underestimate the amount of work it takes to get it right and consequently we opt for the small change that we will have the correct solution the first time around .
Some of you may now be thinking that the obvious solution is to write a proper unit test and run that unit test after every modification , until the code passes the test .
I agree that goes a long way , but usually the test is part of a larger number of classes and running all those tests takes times , especially if it bootstraps an entire Spring - Hibernate application or something of the like .
In such as case , it still takes more time than is needed .
My solution is not to be afraid to experiment .
It seems to cost too much time to create a new script or class , seperate from the larger project , provide the correct libraries , run this small project multiple times to get feedback on your solution and finally copy - paste the solution back into the project your are working on .
However , my experience is that it is well worth the time you need to do this , because it prevents the endless cycles of building - deploying the entire application and getting it to provide feedback .
I hardly write a regular expression or SQL query without first testing it seperately from the application .
Now these example are given at the smallest level , but it also holds for somewhat larger design issues and even for issues people call ' software architecture ' .
Another thing about these small experiments that I find a major advantage , is that it gives you the freedom to explore some avenues that you would n't dare put into the actual project .
You can't just start switching libraries or refactoring relatively large parts of the code and changing too much is risky and frowned upon , even if you can easily revert your changes ( assuming you are using a versioning system .
If you are n't , stop reading , install Subversion and commit your code before continuining this article ) .
A third advantage of experimenting is that it encourages you to rewrite and polish the code that you are writing .
You can go through more iterations in experiments ' outside ' of the project , because you have a clear overview over the code involved .
Modifications of code inside a larger project are less inviting to proper refactoring to do ' the right thing ' .
Painters , writers , craftsmen , even philosophers : if famous ones are asked for the secret of their succes , they always advise exercise and experimentation .
I hope I have explained that it also simply makes sense .
If you do n't want to take it from them , take it from rationale .
The early Lower Palaeolithic remains from Ceprano and Monte Poggiolo show that humans arrived in the Italian peninsula sometime prior to 700,000 years ago .
However , it is not until the Aurignacian period ( ~ 38,000 - 30,000 BP * ) of the Upper Palaeolithic that we see signs of widespread occupation .
The earliest Aurignacian seems to occur in northern Italy , before expanding southwards ( Mussi 1990 ) .
The people of the Aurignacian exploited very diverse habitats in both lowland and mountainous areas , as well as on the island of Sicily .
Extrapolating from data by Bocquet - Appel et al. ( 2005 ) it is possible that the population of Italy did not exceed 1,000 inhabitants .
While this figure is little more than a best guess , it still gives us an idea of the fragile nature of these groups , who were living constantly on the edge of extinction .
With such small numbers inbreeding can become a serious problem .
However , studies of European Upper Palaeolithic people find them to be surprisingly homogenous as a whole , which would suggest a significant amount of gene flow between far - flung populations ( Henke 1989 , 1991 ) .
In order to understand how mating systems would have operated during the Early Upper Palaeolithic researchers have looked to modern hunter - gatherer groups .
Such studies have found hunter - gatherers to have less group closure than agriculturalists .
This would have been an important survival strategy for the hunter - gatherer groups of the Upper Palaeolithic , especially when faced with unpredictable environmental conditions and already constrained mating networks .
This open network is also reflected in the material culture from this period .
Venus figurines , dating chiefly from the Gravettian period , have been found over an area of approximately 2000 km , spanning from modern day Russia in the Northeast to Spain in the Southwest .
The Italian Venuses from Savignano , Balzi Rossi and Parabita show the same female form , with an enlarged midsection , pronounced buttocks , large breasts and voluminous thighs , characteristic of the vast majority of these figurines .
This suggests that there was an extensive flow of people and ideas during the Early Upper Palaeolithic .
This is further supported by the transport of exotic materials , such as flint and shells over distances of several hundred kilometres .
At around 29,000 years ago , the Italian archaeological record falls silent .
This hiatus seems to last for around two millennia .
Mussi ( 2000 ) suggests that Italy may have become a " demographic trap " , due to the combination of low population numbers and small group sizes , leading to the eventual extinction of the Aurignacian people .
Based on their assemblages , is believed that the Gravettian people were a new group , who likely entered the Italian peninsula from south - eastern France .
As climatic conditions worsen , more exotic artefacts begin to appear in the archaeological record .
A major concentration of sites date to around 25,000 BP , suggesting the arrival of immigrants from northern Europe coinciding with the onset of the Last Glacial Maximum .
As new people entered Italy , they had to adapt to strange environments and a more limited variety of animals .
We no longer find high altitude sites like in the Aurignacian .
This shift to lower altitudes is undoubtedly due to the advancing ice .
There is evidence of decreased mobility during the Last Glacial Maximum , which continues until the Mesolithic period ( Holt 2003 ) .
This may reflect a move to more closed systems , as regionalisation grew due to the ever - increasing population density and greater competition over territories .
The burial practices , art , and personal adornments of the Early Upper Palaeolithic , which paralleled those from the rest of the continent disappear at the height of the Last Glacial Maximum , further reflecting a shift to more closed social networks .
As temperatures begin to improve towards the end of the Last Glacial Maximum , these cultural artefacts reappear in abundance , once again mirroring the styles and practices seen elsewhere in Europe .
Sicily comes in for special attention .
The island has long been of interest to anthropologists , who saw the it as a stepping stone between North Africa and Europe .
Ferembach ( 1986 ) postulated that Sicily may have served as an entry point for the North African Aterians ( or their ancestors ) around 50,000 years ago , who later became the " Cro-Magnon race " .
However , this idea finds little archaeological or skeletal support .
Evidence of occupation prior to the Last Glacial Maximum in Sicily is patchy at best .
At the site of Fontana Nuova , Aurignacian tools and isolated fragments of human bone have been found and estimated to date to around 30,000 years ago , making it the earliest record of occupation for the island ( Chilardi et al 1996 ) .
However , it is the only evidence we have for the colonisation of the island during the Aurignacian and it is not until the Epigravettian ( ~20,000 - 10,000 BP ) that we have further evidence of humans in Sicily .
This suggests that the earliest settlers probably went extinct due their small numbers , limited resources and restricted gene flow with the mainland .
It also reflects the pattern seen in the rest of Italy , since there are no Aurignacian sites known after 30,000 BP .
At the site of Grotta di San Teodoro the skeletal remains of seven individuals were found , making it the single largest Upper Palaeolithic sample in Sicily .
An unpublished direct AMS 14C date situates the skeletal remains at around 14,800 BP ( D’Amore et al. 2009 ) .
A recent craniometric study of the San Teodoro skeletons shows that they have higher affinities with the Late Upper Palaeolithic and Mesolithic populations , rather than Early Upper Palaeolithic ones ( ibid . ) .
These results suggest one of two possible scenarios ( a ) an early arrival with gene flow , thus explaining the homogeneity with the mainland Italian groups or ( b ) the late arrival of the direct descendants of the San Teodoro population on the island of Sicily .
At the time of the Last Glacial Maximum there was probably a land bridge between Sicily and the Italian mainland , with sea levels being some 120 metres lower .
The appearance of exotic faunal evidence further suggest this land connection .
While Sicily was occupied as early as the Aurignacian , it may not have been until the Late Epigravettian that the island had a stable population able to overcome the threat of extinction .
Like the rest of Italy , Sicily gives us a unique insight the challenges faced by Europe ’s latest inhabitants .

ARROYO GRANDE , Calif. ( MarketWatch ) -- Something 's in the air .
You can feel it .
A new bull .
Hype ?
Maybe , but also a roaring new bull -- and eventually another meltdown .
Television is a metaphor for our cycles , so see how America 's becoming a huge ratings competition :
" America 's Got Talent . "
Complete with kooky judges like " The Hoff " ( ex - Baywatch lifeguard David Hasselhoff ) , Ozzy 's wife , and Piers Morgan ( no relation to JP ) .
And you 've got to love those wacky contestants going mano - a- mano for Nielsen ratings against those noisy " disrupters " being sent to health - care town hall meetings by the GOP crew .
A sure sign America 's employment picture is improving and the economy is in recovery .
" Who Wants to Be a Millionaire ? " Regis Philbin , the original moderator , is back for 11 fabulous nights in August .
Why ?
A cover -up ?
Maybe it 's tied to all the TARP money paybacks and hot earnings that let the " too - greedy - to - fail " banks make more Wall Street insiders millionaires .
Wall Street loves Regis upstaging Goldman 's giveaway of bonus billions from taxpayers .
" Cash for Clunkers . "
The Chicago school of behavioral purists might say this program is a perfect example of economist Joseph Schumpeter 's " creative destruction " in action .
It 's also great television , rivaling Nascar , Chopper Mania , Monster Trucks and the local demolition derby .
Yes , folks , America loves talent , wants to be a millionaire , loves to destroy stuff , and then rebuild .
Cars , jobs , careers , retirement portfolios , the economy , the stock market .
You can see this metaphor in other great television programs : " Big Brother , " " Hell 's Kitchen , " " Lie to Me , " " Criminal Minds , " " Are You Smarter Than a Fifth - Grader ? "
The point is , TV's a great barometer for the American soul , and it 's screaming " bull ! "
Yes , Americans want another bull , another bubble , even another meltdown .
Guess what ?
It 's already here , folks .
The next big market - economic - business cycle has arrived ahead of schedule .
This is what makes us America .
We love challenges , risk - takers and winners .
The nobody who suddenly becomes a big somebody is the biggest of all TV metaphors for who we are .
America 's got talent .
Where else can you see The Hoff screaming " You got talent ! " to Grandma Lee , a craggy 75 - year old comedian ?
Or Piers rooting for a bunch of half - time acrobats back - flipping off trampolines ?
Or Sharon Osbourne cheering for Kevin Skinner , an unemployed chicken farm - hand who looked like a hobo but wowed us with a voice like Randy Travis .
New , bigger bubble -- and a meltdown ahead
Yes , folks , a new bubble cycle is already in motion .
You can feel the energy building , the kind that fueled the meltdowns of 1998 , 2000 and 2007 .
We never resolved the problems fueling the dot - com insanity .
We made matters worse feeding the subprime credit - derivatives disaster with cheap money , Reaganomics ideology and two costly wars .
Lessons were never learned , nothing was resolved .
Today matters continue deteriorating .
Behind the hoopla , the Wall Street conspiracy has dumped $ 23.7 trillion new bailout debt on taxpayers .
The bill will come due .
But for now , we 're getting their wish : A new bubble is accelerating , thanks to America 's " too - greedy - to - fail " Wall Street banks .
Folks , you can bet on it , sure as Regis is hosting " Who Wants to be a Millionaire ? "
The bull , a bubble , and another meltdown are virtually certain and accelerating faster than earlier cycles , coming by 2012 .
How to profit ?
Ride it up for a couple years , then pray you 'll have enough brain left to bail out in time before the crash ( most do n't ) because at that point the euphoria is blinding , like a cocaine addiction .
Want more proof of inevitability ?
Here are some visionaries who are n't working for Wall Street 's hype machine : Michael Lewis , former Wall Street trader and author of " Panic : The Story of Modern Financial Insanity , " recently told Newsweek : " There 's a false sense that it 's over , that the crisis is passed . "
The bailouts have merely postponed the inevitable .
" We are in for another day of reckoning down the road . "
The next one will be bigger , " badder , " a real demolition derby .
Several months ago , in a Vanity Fair article , " Wall Street Lays Another Egg , " Harvard financial historian Niall Ferguson sounded more like a shrink : " Markets are mirrors of the human psyche . "
Like individuals " they can become depressed ... even suffer complete breakdowns . "
The five stages of a bubble popping
In the 400 - year history of stock markets " there has been a long succession of financial bubbles , " Ferguson says .
" Time and again , asset prices have soared to unsustainable heights only to crash downward again . "
It 's an all - too - familiar cycle , in fact , so familiar is this pattern -- as described by the economic historian Charles Kindleberger -- that it is possible to distill it into five stages :
Displacement : " Some change in economic circumstances creates new and profitable opportunities . "
Last year 's historic bailout , election , new ideology .
Euphoria or overtrading : " A feedback process sets in whereby expectation of rising profits leads to rapid growth in asset prices . "
Goldman is proof .
Mania and bubble : Prospects of " easy capital gains attract first - time investors and swindlers eager to mulct them of their money . "
More bubbles : 2010 - 2011 .
Distress : " Insiders discern that profits cannot possibly justify the now exorbitant price of the assets and begin to take profits . "
Wall Street replays 2007 - 2008 .
Revulsion or discredit : " Asset prices fall , the outsiders stampede for the exits , causing the bubble to burst . "
Yes , 2008 's brutal meltdown repeats in 2012 .
The culprit ?
The Fed , Ferguson says : " Without easy credit creation a true bubble cannot occur .
That is why so many bubbles have their origins in the sins of omission and commission of central banks . "
So the next bubble ( and meltdown ) is virtually certain , thanks to Washington 's $ 23.7 trillion explosion in debt .
Revolution coming with next meltdown
Americans are not going to put up with the " Wall Street Conspiracy " ripping off investors and taxpayers much longer .
Wall Street got rich sticking us with mountains of debt for generations to come .
Expect a major house - cleaning , a second American Revolution .
We predicted the " Great Depression 2 " around 2012 .
Well , we doubt taxpayers will passively sit one more time , like in the 1930s , in 2000 , and the past few years .
Next time voters will take a page from the history books about past revolutions in the American Colonies , France and Russia .
A perfect storm will erupt in a massive global credit meltdown , bringing down Wall Street and the clandestine $ 670 trillion shadow central banking system .
And the collateral damage will be massive and widespread , in areas such as these :
Lobbyists ' power is lethal to our values .
Special interests are running and destroying American democracy , will self - destruct .
Derivatives : Cap 'n trade will crash worse than subprime .
The Goldman Conspiracy 's spending millions lobbying for trillion - dollar derivatives .
" Too - greedy - to - fail " big banks will trigger harsh backlash .
Banks pay huge bonuses yet modify only 9 % of 4 million stressed home loans .
America 's wealth gap will trigger grass - roots rebellion .
Wall Street 's greed is so pervasive , gluttonous and obvious the rest will rebel .
The " Goldman Conspiracy " will be a target for retribution .
Goldman 's hubris is most egregious and flagrant .
Their arrogance will backfire .
Wave of creative destruction will revive commercial banking .
Investment bankers are killing commercial banking , Glass - Steagall will return .
Secrecy protecting Wall Street 's unethical behavior to end .
Wall Street 's control over Washington 's lawmaking will come to an end .
The Fed 's shadow banking will collapse under excess debt .
Central bank balance sheets overdrawn , feeding new bubble with cheap money .
A " Black Swan " of huge unintended consequences .
Next bubble , highly unpredictable , huge collateral damage on Wall Street .
Make the most of this new bull .
Then get out -- before you 're the collateral damage .
Need to borrow some money fast ?
Plenty of people have been in the same situation as you .
After all , sometimes no matter how hard you try to control your spending and manage your budget , you ’ll find that you ’re suddenly hit with an expense that you could n’t have possibly predicted .
Maybe you have a leak in your roof that suddenly needs repairing .
Perhaps you got a bill through the door that you had forgotten all about until just now .

Whatever the reason that you need to borrow money quickly , there have n’t always been a wide range of options to help you achieve your goals .
While personal loans and other traditional lending opportunities are great for certain purposes , they can be complicated and time - consuming to apply for .
Fortunately , as the digital world has become more popular , many companies have begun to embrace the benefits of payday and short - term loans online .
These solutions , offered through online websites and loan providers , are excellent for people who need to access money quickly and easily .
With an online loan , you can access all the cost savings that come with working with a company that does n’t have a physical location to maintain .
This often means that you benefit from a much lower interest rate .
What ’s more , online loans are more convenient and efficient to apply for too .
What Are Short Term Loans ?
Short term loans are small , emergency loans that are intended to give you access to a limited amount of money for a short period of time .
Otherwise referred to as payday loans , these lending solutions are now available within 27 states across the USA .
Additionally , there are nine other states in America that offer short - term lending with a few extra stipulations on how much you can borrow .
The great thing about this kind of loan , is how quick and convenient it is to access .
Rather than applying for a loan with a bank , and spending weeks filling out forms and waiting for responses , you can fill out one form and get your money within 24 hours or less .
Additionally , the money goes straight into your account for you to use however you choose .
You do n’t need to convince the lender that you deserve the money that you ’re asking for .
With a short - term lending option , you also have the freedom that you need to get out of debt as quickly as possible .
This means that you pay back what you owe all at once , often on your next payday .
Compared to other traditional types of lending , this can be a much more convenient way to get out of debt as fast as possible .
What ’s more , because you ’re paying back what you owe quickly , you can show the credit agencies how reliable and sensible you are with your money .
Often , this is a fantastic way to improve your credit rating .
Why Apply for Short Term Loans Online ?
If you ’re living in one of the states that approves payday lending today , then you should find that there are a variety of reliable ways to apply for the money that you need .
Some payday providers even have official stores that you can visit to get the cash handed to you in person .
However , the easiest way to access this kind of loan by far will always be to apply for a loan online .
When you use an online application form , all you need to do is enter a few basic details into an online form , and you can get a response from the lender in a matter of hours .
You can even improve your chances of getting a better detail by spending some time comparing your options for a while before you actually apply for your loan .
Because online loan providers run affordable and convenient loan companies , you can reduce your risk of over - paying for things like excess fees and interest rates .
Additionally , you might be able to track your entire loan process online , rather than dealing with complicated phone systems and other traditional tools .
What ’s more , when the time comes to pay back your loan , you do n’t have to visit the location in person .
Instead , you can set up an automatic payment from your bank account .
The great thing about online loan providers is that there are various different companies out there , ranging from those that support people with poor credit histories , to businesses that are excellent for people in search of specialist loans for veterans .
How to Apply for a Loan Online
Just like doing most things online , applying for a short - term loan is often a quick and simple process .
There are even companies that have mobile - optimized websites .
This means that you can apply for the loan that you need when you ’re on the move .
This can be a particularly useful feature if you ’re looking to get your hands on a loan when dealing with a sudden expense , like a broken - down car .
To apply for the loan , all you need to do is start by comparing your options online .
You can find countless companies that will be willing to offer you a loan in your area .
Make sure that you look for a company that you can trust by checking if they have the right certifications and regulatory approval .
Additionally , it may be helpful to check out some of the reviews and ratings that other customers have left .
Once you find a loan provider that you feel comfortable with , you can sign up for an account on their website or complete an application form as a guest .
Usually , the form will ask you for some basic information , such as :
Where you live
What your credit history looks like
If you have any financial issues the loan provider needs to be aware of
How much you earn at work
How long you have been employed at the same job
Whether you ’re a citizen of the US
How much you want to borrow
When you can pay back what you owe ( usually your next payday )
Your age
While it ’s relatively easy to be approved for a short term loan , you can boost your chances of getting the money you need quickly by checking the terms and conditions laid out on the company ’s website .
This will also give you an insight into some other important things , such as whether there are any extra fees that you need to consider , or potential late fees .
What to Consider When Looking for a Loan ?
So if you decide that you do want to borrow money with a short - term loan online , what should you be looking at ?
Well , as we mentioned above , it ’s generally a good idea to make sure that you ’re working with a company that you can trust .
That means reading through the reviews left by other customers and ensuring that you check for any regulations and certifications that the business might have .
It ’s also worth noting that different companies will be able to give you different deals when it comes to small loans for bad credit .
Some loan companies can provide large amounts of money , anywhere up to a few thousand dollars .
Other organizations will only be able to give you a few hundred dollars at a time .
Depending on how much cash you need , it ’s important to check that your company can provide something that suits your requirements .
Additionally , remember to check how quickly your loan provider can get your money to you .
Most people rely on short - term online loans when they ’re in desperate need of quick cash .
If that ’s the case for you , then it ’s usually a good idea to ensure that the company can get the money to you within as little time as possible .
Some providers could give you access to your loan within 24 hours or less .
Remember , although all loan providers – even those in the payday market , will need to check to see whether you have the right credit score to get your loan , there are different ways that people can check your credit too .
A loan provider that can conduct a soft credit check could be able to let you know whether you ’re likely to be approved for your loan , without harming your credit score .
This could be an ideal option for people who are worked about getting the money that they need from their first application .

NOAH ( New Orleans Arcology Habitat ) is a massive , 1200 - foot city within a building that 's hurricane - proof and can actually float ( do n't worry , it 's tethered to something or other ) .
Conceptualized through a mind trust of three architectural firms , green ( wind , solar and water ) energies would help power the structure 's 20,000 residences , 1,000,000 square feet of commercial space , school , hospital and , just for fun , 3 casinos .
On one hand , this floating triangle seems like nothing less than a feat of modern engineering , a clever idea that 's both structurally sound and handy in an emergency .
On the other , have we given up so much on New Orleans that architects should abandon existing infrastructure altogether ?
If culture and way of life are not things we 're looking to preserve , then why not just tell residents to move and be done with it ?

UPDATE ( 5/1/2020 ) - Easy Compressor
Fix :
I came downstairs to pour a pint one day and noticed my kegerator was only cooling to 56 degrees !
I thought it was dead , but based on a little online research , I ended up finding a simple enough fix that everyone should try before scrapping your keezer / kegerator if the same thing happens to you .
Check out my fix HERE .
UPDATE ( 9/6/2017 ) : I 'm back to the keezer after moving into a new house .
The build process was exactly the same as the previous ones , except I went with a digital temp controller on this one .
I added the link to that on the parts list below in case you 're interested .
I prefer the digital version to the analog , but both work very well overall .
I 've added a few pictures of the build below .
UPDATE ( 5/14/2015 ) :
Sold the Keezer to a fellow homebrewer , so I 'm down to " only " the Fridge Kegerator and five taps .
Nine beers on tap was just a bit too much now that we 're having less people over to the house .
UPDATE ( 2/1/2010 ) :
The original GE 7 cubic foot freezer I used to build my chest freezer kegerator out of ended up taking a crap on me .
The new one I purchased from Sam's Club ended up being about 1 " narrower than the previous model I had purchased .
I was still able to fit 4 kegs into the freezer , but it was a MUCH tighter fit .
Looking back , I probably would have shopped around for a different model that had a little more room .
Check out this forum post about different models of freezers and how many kegs they hold :

2017 Keezer Build
After building a Sanyo Kegerator and getting a lot of use out of it , I realized that I needed a wider variety of beer on tap .
I did a little research on the Northern Brewer forum as well as some Google searches to find examples of what I was looking to build .
I ended up getting a 7.0 cubic foot GE chest freezer from Sam's Club for $ 177 plus tax that would fit 4 corny kegs comfortably .
If you are unsure how many kegs a particular model of chest freezer will hold , I suggest you make paper cut-outs of the base of your kegs and place them inside the freezer to test it out .
I considered two methods for dispensing beer with a chest freezer .
The first was to mount two draft towers with two taps on each tower which can be seen HERE .
This would require drilling into the lid of the chest freezer and bracing the towers with some kind of wooden support from below .
The other option is to build a wooden collar out of 2 ” x wood of your choice which can be seen HERE .
The taps can then be mounted through the wood collar and no permanent damage is done to the freezer .
I chose the second method because it seemed like the most logical way to go about building a kegerator .
If the freezer quits working , I can take off the collar and the freezer is back to its original configuration .
Here 's what I came up with for the final price of the Chest Freezer Kegerator :
After unpacking the chest freezer , I removed the lid and measured the top so I could build a wooden collar to mount my taps through .
I decided that I would use 2 ” x6 ” pine to build my collar .
My first attempt at building a collar did n’t work out so well .
I tried using 45 degree miter cuts to give the collar a cleaner look , but my cuts must not have been exactly 45 degrees because my collar was n’t square .
After wasting a night messing with that , I went back to Lowe ’s and had them cut the wood square for me so I would n’t have to mess with it at home .
When I got home , I realized that the kid at Lowe ’s cut two of my boards too short , so I made another trip across town to get the right sized wood .
I held the wood together with miter clamps and used two 2.5 inch screws on each joint to hold everything together .
I probably should have used some wood glue in between each piece , but I did n’t .
I did a little finishing sanding and rounded the edges of the collar in order to get it ready to stain .
The stain I used supposedly had polyurethane in it so it was a one coat type of thing , but I ended up putting on two coats just to be safe .
Here are some pictures of the collar as it was drying .
After the collar had dried overnight , I put it on top of the freezer to make sure it was square .
Once this was done , I laid down a thick bead of silicone all the way around the freezer and put the collar on top of it and weighted it down with some dumbbells and ammo containers .
To ensure a tight seal and good insulation , I used silicone to seal up all the seams on my collar and also where the collar met the freezer .
Since some people on the Northern Brewer forum stated they had rust issues in the metal seams of the freezer , I also sealed up the bottom of the freezer to prevent this from happening .
Once the silicone had dried overnight , I positioned the lid on the collar and screwed in the hinges using 1 ” wood screws .
Here are a few pictures of what it looked like .
Now that the freezer was starting to look more like what I was aiming for , I figured I ’d better get the taps mounted .
I decided to drill my holes towards the top of the 2x6 so I would n’t have to bend over as much when I was pouring a pint .
I may have to build a wooden base to rise up the freezer for better access later .
I used a 7/8 ” drill bit to make the holes through the collar and that provided a very snug fit against the shanks .
After measuring twice and drilling the holes , I inserted the 3 ” shanks and attached the faucets .
If I were to go it again , I would have purchased 4 ” shanks instead so I would have a little more working room .
With my 3 ” shanks , I ca n’t build an overhanging collar like others have done to provide a more stable collar .
I took this opportunity to put some tap handles on the faucets and snap some shots of what the finished project would look like .
Next came the gas setup .
I used a 4 - way gas manifold from MoreBeer since I was planning on using 4 kegs .
I would have purchased a 5 - way but they did n’t have one .
An extra CO2 line is always handy for quick keg carbonation or running cleaning solution through your lines .
For my gas lines , I used 5/16 ” blue tubing from The Beverage Factory .
I figured that 4 ’ of tubing for each keg would be plenty , so that ’s what I cut them to .
One “ issue ” I ran into with the tubing was that the quick disconnects were ¼ ” and the tubing was 5/16 ” .
The hose clamps I purchased from Menards were n’t the best quality , and when I tried tightening them down hard , they would slip .
I ended up using some clamps that I had purchased from Lowe ’s on the ¼ ” quick disconnect barbs .
These clamps had smaller notches in the metal so they tightened down without any problems .
Another positive for bulidng a collar was that I could fit my 10lb CO2 tank inside the freezer without a problem .
After the gas lines were installed , I attached the beer line to my shank barbs .
The beer tubing was 3/16 ” inner diameter , and the barbs were ¼ ” which made for a very tight fit .
I found that soaking the end of the tubing in hot water made it much easier to put on the barbs .
I used 5 feet of tubing for each tap and plan on setting the CO2 at 10 - 12psi .
This makes for a balanced system .
Since I did n’t want my beer to freeze inside the freezer , it was then time to install the temperature controller .
After measuring the distance between the mounting holes on the back of the controller , I used 4 screws to attach the controller to the collar .
I then drilled a hole in the back of the freezer just big enough for the probe to fit inside the freezer .
You want the probe to be suspended rather than be touching the metal sides of the freezer .
Once I had the probe positioned , I used a good amount of silicone to seal up the hole .
Now that everything had been installed , I moved the kegerator to its final location and set the temperature controller to 38 degrees .
I plugged in the power and the compressor turned on .
The freezer cooled down very quickly and seemed to be at the right temperature .
I already had 5 kegs waiting to go in the freezer , so I picked out 4 to be the christening beers .
My Goldings Stout , Winter Warmer , Belgian Strong Dark Ale , and Brown Ale all went into the kegerator and I hooked up the CO2 .
I mixed up half a keg of Idophor sanitizing solution and ran it through all the beer lines so they would be ready to go .
Now all I have to do is wait .
The United States have a well known history of providing military support to countries in need .
But from time to time , the US Government has provided secret forces .
While many are successful , there have also been a number of failures .
This is a list of the ten top secret armies of the CIA .
18 Ukrainian Partisans
From 1945 to 1952 the CIA trained and aerially supplied Ukranian partisan units which had originally been organised by he Germans to fight the Soviets during WWII .
For seven years , the partisans , operating in the Carpathian Mountains , made sporadic attacks .
Finally in 1952 , a massive Soviet military force wiped them out .
17 Chinese Brigade in Burma
Advertisement
After the Communist victory in China , Nationalist Chinese soldiers fled into northern Burma .
During the early 1950s , the CIA used these soldiers to create a 12,000 man brigade which made raids into Red China .
However , the Nationalist soldiers found it more profitable to monopolise the local opium trade .
16 Guatemalan Rebel Arm
After Guatemalan president Jacobo Arbenz legalised that country ’s communist party and expropriated 400,000 acres of United Fruit banana plantations , the CIA decided to overthrow his government .
Guatemalan rebels were trained in Honduras and backed up with a CIA air contingent of bombers and fighter planes .
This army invaded Guatemala in 1954 , promptly toppling Arbenz ’s regine .
15 Sumatran Rebels
In an attempt to overthrow Indonesian president Sukarno in 1958 , the CIA sent paramilitary experts and radio operators to the island of Sumatra to organise a revolt .
With CIA air support , the rebel army attacked but was quickly defeated .
The American government denied involvement even after a CIA b- 26 was shot down and its CIA pilot , Allen Pope , was captured .
14 Khamba Horsemen
After the 1950 Chinese invasion of Tibet , the CIA began recruiting Khamba horsemen – fierce warriors who supported Tibet ’s religious leader , the Dalai Lama – as they escaped into India in 1959 .
These Khambas were trained in modern warfare at Camp Hale , high in the rocky mountains near Leadville , Colorado .
Transported back to Tibet by the CIA operated Air American , the Khambas organised an army number at its peak some 14,000 .
By the mid-1960s the Khambas had been abandoned by the CIA but they fought on alone until 1970 .
13 Bay of Pigs Invasion Force
In 1960 , CIA operatives recruited 1,500 Cuban refugees living in Miami and staged a surprise attack on Fidel Castro ’s Cuba .
Trained at a base in Guatemala , this small army – complete with an air force consisting of B - 26 bombers – landed at the Bay of Pigs on April 19 , 1961 .
The ill - conceived , poorly planned operation ended in disaster , since all but 150 men of the force were either killed or captured within three days .

12 L’armee Clandestine
In 1962 , CIA agents recruited Meo tribesmen living in the mountains of Laos to fight as guerrillas against Communist Pathet Lao forces .
Called l’armee Clandestine , this unit – paid , trained , and supplied by the CIA – grew into a 30,000 man force .
By 1975 the Meos – who had numbers a quarter million in 1962 – had been reduced to 10,000 refugees fleeing into Thailand .
11 Nung Mercenaries
A Chinese hill people living in Vietname , the Nungs were hired and organised by the CIA as a mercenary force , during the Vietnam war .
Fearsome and brutal fighters , the Nungs were employed throughout Vietnam and along the Ho Chi Minh Trail .
The Nungs proved costly since they refused to fight unless constantly supplied with beer and prostitutes .
10 Peruvian Regiment
Unable to quell guerrilla forces in its eastern Amazonian provinces , Peru called on the US for help in the mid-1960s .
The CIA responded by establishing a fortified camp in the area and hiring local Peruvians who were trained by Green Beret personnel on loan from the US army .
After crushing the guerrillas , the elite unit was disbanded because of fears it might stage a coup against the government .
9 Congo Mercenary Force
In 1964 , during the Congolese Civil War , the CIA established an army in the Congo to back pro-Western leaders Cyril Adoula and Joseph Mobutu .
The CIA imported European mercenaries and Cuban pilots – exiles from Cuba – to pilot the CIA air force , composed of transports and B - 26 Bombers .
8 The Cambodian Coup
For over 15 years , the CIA had tried various unsuccessful means of deposing Cambodia ’s left - leaning Prince Norodom Sihanouk , including assassination attempts .
However , in March , 1970 , a CIA - backed coup finally did the job .
Funded by US tax dollars , armed with US weapons , and trained by American Green Berets , anti-Sihanouk forces called Kampuchea Khmer Krom ( KKK ) overran the capital of Phnom Penh and took control of the government .
With the blessing of the CIA and the Nixon administration , control of Cambodia was placed in the hands of Lon Nol , who would later distinguish himself by dispatching soldiers to butcher tens of thousands of civilians .
7 Kurd Rebels
During the early 1970s the CIA moved into eastern Iraq to organize and supply the Kurds of that area , who were rebelling against the pro-Soviet Iraqi government .
The real purpose behind this action was to help the shah of Iran settle a border dispute with Iraq favourably .
After an Iranian - Iraq settlement was reached , the CIA withdrew its support from the Kurds , who were then crushed by the Iraqi Army .
6 Angola Mercenary Force
In 1975 , after years of bloody fighting and civil unrest in Angola , Portugal resolved to relinquish its hold on the last of its African colonies .
The transition was to take place on November 11 , with control of the country going to whichever political faction controlled the capital city of Luanda on that date .
In the months preceding the change , three groups vied for power : the Popular Movement for the Liberation of Angola ( MPLA ) , the National Front for the Liberation of Angola ( FNLA ) and the National Union for the Total Independence of Angola ( UNITA ) .
By July 1975 , the Marxist MPLA had ousted the moderate FNLA and UNITA from Luanda , so the CIA decided to intervene covertly .
Over $ 30 million was spent on the Angolan operation , the bulk of the money going to buy arms and pay French and South African mercenaries , who aided the FNLA and UNITA in their fight .
Despite overwhelming evidence to the contrary , US officials categorically denied any involvement in the Angolan conflict .
In the end , it was a fruitless military adventure , for the MPLA assumed power and controls Angola to this day .
5 Afghan Mujaheedin
Covert support for the groups fighting against the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan began under President Jimmy Carter in 1979 , and was stepped up during the administration of Ronald Reagan .
The operation succeeded in its initial goal , as the Soviets were forced to begin withdrawing their forces in 1987 .
Unfortunately , once the Soviets left , the US essentially ignored Afghanistan as it collapsed into a five - year civil war followed by the rise of the ultra - fundamentalist Taliban .
The Taliban provided a haven for Osama bin Laden and al - Qaeda , the perpetrators of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in 2001 .
4 Salvadoran Death Squads
As far back as 1964 , the CIA helped form ORDEN and ANSESAL , two paramilitary intelligence networks that developed into the Salvadoran death squads .
The CIA trained ORDEN leaders in the use of automatic weapons and surveillance techniques , and placed several leaders on the CIA payroll .
The CIA also provided detailed intelligence on Salvadoran individuals later murdered by the death squads .
During the civil war in El Salvador from 1980 to 1992 , the death squads were responsible for 40,000 killings .
Even after a public outcry forced President Reagan to denounce the death squads in 1984 , CIA support continued .
3 Nicaraguan Contras
On November 23 , 1981 , President Ronald Reagan signed a top secret National Security Directive authorising the CIA to spend $ 19 million to recruit and support the Contras , opponents of Nicaragua ’s Sandinista government .
In supporting the Contras , the CIA carried out several acts of sabotage without the Congressional intelligence committees giving consent – or even being informed beforehand .
In response , Congress passed the Boland Amendment , prohibiting the CIA from providing aid to the Contras .
Attempts to find alternate sources of funds led to the Iran - Contra scandal .
It may also have led the CIA and the Contras to become actively involved in drug smuggling .
In 1988 , the Senate Subcommittee on Narcotics , Terrorism , and International Operations concluded that individuals in the Contra movement engaged in drug trafficking ; that known drug traffickers provided assistance to the Contras ; and that ‘ there are some serious questions as to whether or not US officials involved in Central America failed to address the drug issue for fear of jeopardizing the war effort against Nicaragua ’ .
2 Haitian Coup
In 1988 , the CIA attempted to intervene in Haiti ’s elections with a ‘ covert action program ’ to undermine the campaign of the eventual winner , Jean - Bertrand Aristide .
Three years later , Aristide was overthrown in a bloody coup that killed more than 4,000 civilians .
Many of the leaders of the coup had been on the CIA payroll since the mid-1980s .
For example , Emmanuel ‘ Toto ’ Constant , the head of FRAPH , a brutal gang of thugs known for murder , torture , and beatings , admitted to being a paid agent of the CIA .
Similarly , the CIA - created Haitian National Intelligence Service ( NIS ) , supposedly created to combat drugs , functioned during the coup as a ‘ political intimidation and assassination squad . ’
In 1994 , an American force of 20,000 was sent to Haiti to allow Aristide to return .
Ironically , even after this , the CIA continued working with FRAPH and the NIS .
In 2004 , Aristide was overthrown once again , with Aristide claiming that US forces had kidnapped him .
1 Venezuelan Coup Attempt
On April 11 , 2002 , Venezuelan military leaders attempted to overthrow the country ’s democratically - elected left - wing president , Hugo Chavez .
The coup collapsed after two days as hundreds of thousands of people took to the streets and as units of the military joined with the protestors .
The administration of George W. Bush was the only democracy in the Western Hemisphere not to condemn the coup attempt .
According to intelligence analyst Wayne Madsen , the CIA had actively organised the coup : ‘ The CIA provided Special Operations Group personnel , headed by a lieutenant colonel on loan from the US Special Operations Command at Fort Bragg , North Carolina , to help organise the coup against Chavez .

The book of lists
Latent HIV genes can be ' smoked out ' of human cells .
The so - called ' shock and kill ' technique , described in a preclinical study in BioMed Central 's open access journal Retrovirology , might represent a new milestone along the way to the discovery of a cure for HIV / AIDS .
Dr. Enrico Garaci , president of the Istituto Superiore di Sanità ( the Italian Institute of Health ) and Dr. Andrea Savarino , a retrovirologist working at the institution , worked with a team of researchers to study the so - called " barrier of latency " which has been the main obstacle to HIV eradication from the body .
Cells harbouring a quiescent HIV genome are responsible for HIV persistence during therapy .
In other words , HIV - 1 genes become pieces of the human organism , and many scientists have simply thought there is nothing we can do .
Dr Savarino 's team aimed to ' smoke out ' the virus in order to render the latently infected cells targetable by the immune system or artificial means .
They write , " This can be achieved using inhibitors of histone deacetylases ( HDACs ) , which are a class of enzymes that maintain HIV latency .
However , their effects on HIV are evident only when used in toxic quantities " .
To overcome this problem , the Italian researchers tested a collection of HDAC inhibitors , some of which specifically target only certain enzyme isoforms ( class I HDACs ) that are involved in HIV latency .
The toxicity of this approach , however , was not markedly decreased , although it compromises a more limited number of cellular pathways .
Moreover , at non-toxic quantities , class I HDAC inhibitors were able to induce the ' awakening ' of a portion of cells within a latently infected cell population .
The researchers then repeated the experiment adding a drug inducing oxidative stress , buthionine sulfoximine ( BSO ) .
The results showed that BSO recruited cells non-responsive to the HDAC inhibitors into the responding cell population .
An important result was that the infected cells ' ' awakening ' was followed by cell death , whereas the non-infected cells were left intact by the drug combination .
" I really hope this study may open new avenues to the development of weapons able to eliminate the HIV - infected cells from the body " , says Dr. Andrea Savarino , " Such weapons , in combination with antiretroviral therapies , could hopefully allow people living with HIV / AIDS to get rid of the virus and return to a normal life .
Of note , there are testable drug combinations composed of molecules that have passed phase I clinical trials for safety in humans " .
This type of approach has been dubbed ' shock and kill ' .
" Although this type of approach is largely accepted by the scientific community " , adds Dr. Savarino , " to be honest , we have to take into consideration that some scientists are skeptical about this approach , and others even think that a cure for HIV / AIDS will never be found .
Experiments using animal models will shed a new light on this difficult problem . "
Confucianism has grown in popularity in recent years
Two million people are now recognised as being descendants of the Chinese philosopher Confucius , more than tripling the number in the last count .
The announcement was made as the fifth update to Confucius ' family tree was unveiled on the 2,560th anniversary of his birth , say Chinese state media .
Last updated in 1937 , the book lists all 83 generations of descendents .
For the first time women , ethnic minorities and descendants living overseas have been included .
The 43,000 - page document , spreading over 80 books , was unveiled at a ceremony in Confucius ' home town of Qufu , said Xinhua news agency .
It adds 1.4 million names to the family tree of Confucius , known in China as Kong Fuzi , and is believed by the authorities to be the world 's largest .
" Confucius ' family tree is a national treasure , " said Kong Deyong , a 77th generation descendant and head of the International Confucius Association .
Mr Kong said the family tree was important not only for academic research , but also for " helping Confucius ' descendants around the world discover their ancestors and strengthen family bonds " .
Confucius ' blood is flowing in our body
Kong Dejun Confucianism has traditionally given women a lower status than men in its strict hierarchy , so female descendants were not counted , but genealogists announced in 2006 that they had decided to " move with the times " .
Mr Kong said that even if many descendants were not Chinese nationals or Han Chinese - the majority ethnic group in China - " we should count them in because we are one big family " .
Kong Dejun , a former university teacher who travelled from Switzerland for the ceremony , said being included in the book was " the most exciting moment in my life " .
" In terms of genes , Confucius ' blood is flowing in our body , " she told Xinhua , adding that the inclusion of women " shows Chinese females ' status is improving " .
The new family tree cost 10 m yuan ( $ 1.4 m ; £ 1 m ) to produce , paid for by the descendants .
Confucius was dismissed as bourgeois and a relic of China 's feudal past by Mao Zedong during the 1960s Cultural Revolution .
But Confucian thought has enjoyed a surge in popularity in recent years and the Chinese government has even funded a film of the philosopher 's life , starring Hong Kong actor Chow Yun -Fat .

( An inquiry into the nature of ownership . )
I bought a book at the thrift shop the other day .
A thrift shop run by a group of women calling themselves " The Assistance League . "
The book is Whiteman , a novel by Tony D'Sousa , 2006 .
I paid for it , put it in my bag and took it home .
It was a hardback , first edition , first printing .
I paid two bucks for it .
The flap says ' $ 22.00 , more in Canada . '
The dust jacket is a beautiful design in reds , yellows and whites with a painting by Ouattara Watts .
It 's a thoughtful meditative story of a young man gone to Africa on some form of do - gooder mission .
He ends up in a very primitive rural village in the Ivory Coast region .
He is as foreign to his village hosts as they to him .
I 'm about halfway through it and am enjoying it immensely .
I recommend it .
My story here , however , is different .
On the first page of that book , that blank sheet of paper before any of the ' book ' begins , is a carefully written note : Read , Enjoy , and Pass Along !
Please leave in a public place for someone else to pick up .
And do n't forget to write down where you are from !
1 . Dinosaur , CO ( no other entries as of yet )
In the book we have a clash of many cultures .
One clash is that between the tribe our narrator lives with , a tribe who has a permanent village settlement , around which they clear small fields and grow various foodstuffs .
Camped nearby is a migratory tribe who tend a herd of cattle and live by selling and consuming the milk .
The two tribes interact but each regards the other with disdain .
The landed tribe is structured and uses some punishment as a means of seeking compliance with its norms .
The migratory tribe appears more relaxed and tends its herd with gentle suggestion and care rather than with whips and sticks .
Once the lush grass upon which the cattle feed is gone , the migratory tribe will up and move along to another area , setting up camp there .
All of this action is occurring against the distant murmur and sometimes roar of the competing conquerors in the form of the French and English , the Christians and the Muslims - - somewhat along the lines of how birds and fish live within the constant larger forces of tides and storms that lash the coast .
And , speaking of the coast , another book I read just last week is similar in subtext .
Skeletons on the Zahara , by Dean King , is the true documentary of an American merchant vessel which crashed aground on the West African coast in the very early 1800s .
The ship was lost on the rocks but all hands made it safely to shore along with much salvage from the ship in the way of silver , food , clothing and such .
Within a matter of days at most , a nomadic tribe of Arabs comes upon the shipwrecked sailors , proceeds to commandeer all of the spoils and then enslave the men .
Shortly thereafter , this tribe encounters another and there is a great deal of trading of spoils and slaves and so the men are split and separated .
This same scenario occurs again and again over the next few weeks with other groups .
Life among these nomadic Arabs is marginal at the very best , with the white merchant slaves getting the dregs of what meager food and water the desert may occasionally grudgingly give up .
The men waste away to mere skeletons hanging on very tenuously to life .
It appears the Arabs were more adapted to this life and could go for days without food and water and still be able to trudge across the desert , where the white men would simply collapse from exhaustion .
The Arabs appeared to be totally without empathy .
They may have thought that these slaves of theirs were simply seeking to avoid the harsh life of the desert .
In one instance it was revealed that the Arabs apparently did not understand the concept of fainting and beat an unconscious man unmercifully , trying to get him to get up and walk .
Whatever the thinking , in many instances the slaves were beaten and left to die alone when they could not negotiate the searing sun , freezing nights , and dearth of water and food .
Yet at other times , there seemed to be a sense of human compassion between slave and master that defied understanding .
They were property and yet they were also companions and comrades depending upon ... well , it was impossible for the white slaves to grasp what the reasoning was .
There were certain customary laws among these nomadic desert - dwelling tribes .
One of these was the idea that if there was food and / or water , it was available and to be shared freely with all and sundry .
For example , if one tribe , wandering across the desolation of the dry sands , should encounter an encampment of another group , the encamped group would proceed to bring forth food and drink for the new arrivals and share without limit , even if the amount of stores was insufficient to properly feed the first group .
This appeared to be unquestioned .
There did not seem to be any sense of property rights in ' first possession . '
In fact , it was as if there was the antithesis of property rights ' the obligation to share , regardless of the consequences .
The exception was where the slaves were concerned .
Being slaves , they did n't count as humans , I guess , and so while all others were feasting or at least quenching their thirsts , often the slaves were left with nothing , even when they might have been on death 's door for lack of food or water .
In these instances , it was interesting to observe the inconsistent manner in which these human properties were treated .
In some situations , they were brought into the circle and provided with a bountiful repast , at other times completely ignored and left writhing in wretched misery .
There seemed no consistency , no given concept of human mutuality that could be discerned .
It seems to me there is more of an inclination to share with others when there is little to share , and more of an inclination to behave niggardly when life is easy , sure and flush .
Another interesting cultural norm among these nomadic Arabs appears to be the idea of the defining conditions of ownership of property .
It appears that the notion of property was fairly clear and standard ( by which I guess I mean that it makes sense according to my cultural norms ) .
But if one took the property of another which that other has not been attentive to , and if that other did not immediately seek redress and reclaim that property , it was then understood that the property had been rightfully transferred to the person who abducted it , and it was henceforth acknowledged as his property as long as he maintained and protected it with sufficient ardor .
So ownership would seem to rely , to some extent , on the intent and investment of the owner .
Which gives some support to the expression : possession is nine - tenths of the law .
All of which brings me back to the thrift shop book .
It seems a reasonable assumption that the person who made the notation inside the cover of the book had purchased the book from its original owner , presumably a book vendor , and then had intentionally set it free , with a proper declaration stating the terms of its ownership .
So now I find it in my possession , having actually paid for this book which had been given its freedom , and I am pondering my position .
It is said that stolen property remains stolen until returned to its owner , regardless of whose hands it may have passed through or what sums have been paid for it in its travels .
What then of this book ?
It would appear to me that , even though I have paid for it , it is not mine , rather it is owned by itself , free to share its pleasures and ideas wherever it might find a willing audience .
I am reminded of the nature of human slaves .
Many born " free " ( not born to humans who were already considered as slaves ) , they were captured and sold , but then it was occasionally the practice that they were allowed to once again purchase their own freedom , or to have it granted to them by their then current owner .
But using the logic of this process , they would have just as easily been subject to recapture by someone else and re-enslavement as per their original transition from freedom into enslavement .
Possession ?
Possession grants rights of ownership ?
How very strange a concept .
I must say that the intersection of this book 's life and travels with mine has caused me quite a bit of consternation on this matter of property rights .
For those who proclaim that property rights are clear and self - evident , I suggest that you may be practicing a form of religious idolatry .
As for the book , I think I will find a proper spot for it and set it free according to its nature , and with due respect for the story it has shared with me .
The problem then remains for me -- what to do with the rest of my books .
I think the concept of " mixing one 's labor " has some value in the equation , but does the act of placing manacles satisfy that requirement ?
It does appear that the older I grow , the less I know for sure .
MooseX :: SingletonMethod now on CPAN
So has promised or was it threatened I ’ve packaged and uploaded MooseX : : SingletonMethod to CPAN .
Here is the synopsis from the pod :
package Baz ; use Moose ; with ' MooseX : : SingletonMethod :: Role ' ; no Moose ; package main ; my $ baz = Baz - > new ; my $ foo = Baz - > new ; # add singleton method called " baz " just to $ baz and not to Baz class $ baz->add_singleton_method ( baz => sub { ' baz ! ' } ) ; say $ baz -> baz ; # => ' baz ! ' say $ foo -> baz ; # ERROR : Ca n't locate object method " baz " ....
MooseX is the namespace for adding extensions around Moose .
Its the playground of future Moose features where modules get torn , beaten and bruised in a development rite of passage .
It would one day be nice to see MooseX : : Singleton Method features grow up and become part of standard Moose family 🙂
MooseX :: SingletonMethod can also be found in these exotic areas of the web :
/ I3az /
PS .
While sticking my flag into the MooseX : : SingletonMethod namespace I noticed the following module by Simon Cozens :
I ’m amazed this as passed me by especially has I first came to understand Singleton Methods from Simon ’s excellent “ Advanced Perl Programming ” book .
Just shows you how deep and diverse the CPAN universe is !

If you have n’t heard of Clint Hackleman ’s Myndflame yet , it ’s about time you did .
Primarily a WoW video production team , their top - notch editing skills really need to be seen to be believed — and even then , it might be a little difficult to accept just how good they are .
Illegal Danish is known as their best known and longest - running series , having lasted and held a healthy fan - following since 2006 .
It initially started out as Zinwrath : The Movie , but Illegal Danish has snowballed into its own totally hilarious soon - to - be three part series .
And I do mean “ series ” — Illegal Danish : Super Snacks clocks at over 20 minutes , and its sequel Illegal Danish 2 : Escape from Orgrimmar is over 24 minutes long .
To really understand what ’s going on watch Zinwrath first and then Super Snacks followed by Escape , they are totally worth your combined 50 minutes of watch time .
Watching them in order not only makes it easier to understand ( I accidentally watched them in reverse , actually ) , but it really shows how their editing skills have progressed over the years .
The upcoming movie in the series , Illegal Danish 3 : The Ballad of Dirti G , looks like it is going to take everything from the first two and multiply it tenfold .
Myndflame outlines the plot below :
Van Kraken has created his ultimate brew , the flask of ten thousand souls .
The flask is so powerful that only by combining it with the power of the Illegal Danish can it be consumed without fear of death .
Even coming into contact with a single drop could be fatal , so Van Kraken forces the remaining residents within the corrupt city of Gnomeregan to help him build a device capable of containing its power .
While evaluating the device he realizes that it ’s been designed only for a gnome , and with his enemies closing in and relations wearing thin with his allies he must quickly find a susceptible gnome to harness the power and lead his army of Kraken Knights .
It sounds a lot more serious than it will most likely be , but the trailer for Illegal Danish 3 really is serious business .
Seriously awesome business .
The trailer is a total mock up of the Starcraft 2 trailer with the Marine getting suited up .

I do n’t recall if I ’ve mentioned it on SBM before , but I went to the University of Michigan .
In fact , I did n’t go there just for undergraduate studies or medical school , but rather for both , graduating with a B.S. in Chemistry with Honors in 1984 and from medical school in 1988 .
In my eight years in Ann Arbor , I came to love the place , and I still have an affinity for it , even though it ’s been over 20 years since I last walked about the campus as a student , although I have been back from time to time for various functions , most recently to see Brian Deer speak last winter .
True , I ’m not fanatical about it , as some of my contemporaries and friends who attened U. of M. with me back in the 1980s ( and , sadly , the string of losses to Ohio State and the definitively mediocre last season Michigan had last year make it very hard to be a Michigan football fan these days ) .
However , I do have considerable affection for the place .
It molded me , trained me in science , taught me medicine , and provided me the basis for everything I do professionally today .
I mention all of this because I ’ve become very disappointed with the University of Michigan Medical School of late .
The reason is that it ’s “ distinguished itself ” as a leading institution teaching and promoting the mish - mash of sometimes mutually contradictory modalities , the vast majority of which are either based on mysticism or pseudoscience , known commonly as either “ complementary and alternative medicine ” ( CAM ) or “ integrative medicine ” ( IM ) .
The University of Michigan Integrative Medicine Program ( UMIM ) describes itself thusly :
University of Michigan Integrative Medicine , an interdisciplinary program , is committed to the thoughtful and compassionate integration of complementary therapies and conventional medicine through the activities of research , education , clinical services and community partnerships .
As a healing - oriented approach to medical care , integrative medicine takes into account the whole person ( body , mind , spirit and emotion ) , including all aspects of lifestyle .
The vision , mission and values of the University of Michigan Integrative Medicine ( UMIM ) program reflect our belief that patients and our community are best served when all available therapies are considered in concert with an approach that recognizes the intrinsic wholeness of each individual .
It also reflects our belief that the best medicine is practiced in collaboration with a wide variety of healthcare professionals and with our patients .
Alas , my alma mater could well be featured in Kim ’s old feature , the Weekly Waluation of the Weasel Words of Woo ( W5 ) .
Indeed , look at the medical student curriculum supported by this program :
Supported by a five - year grant from the National Institutes of Health ( NIH ) , University of Michigan Integrative Medicine ( UMIM ) piloted its first Complementary and Alternative Medicine ( CAM ) courses for medical students during the Fall Term of 2000 .
A unique aspect of the CAM course sequence is that it is longitudinal , extending across the entire four - year U - M Medical School curriculum .
To date , implementation of the curriculum has involved the participation of approximately 600 undergraduate medical students and 200 physicians / practitioners .
Instruction has touched upon the following five CAM domains as identified by the National Center for Complementary and Alternative Medicine ( NCCAM ) : Alternative medical systems
Mind - body interventions
Biologically based therapies
Manipulative and body - based methods
Energy therapies
Energy therapies ?
As you can see my alma mater , my beloved U. of M. , appears to have wholeheartedly embraced what Dr. Robert Donnell has referred to as “ quackademic medicine . ”
Indeed , it now has a fellowship in IM that is described thusly :
Fellows design elective experiences in integrative medicine using resources found within the university health care system .
Topics may include ( but are not limited to ) : Aromatherapy , Health System Management , Herbal Therapies , Holistic Nutrition , Integrative Pharmacy , Manipulative Therapies , Mind -Body Medicine , and Naturopathic Medicine .
Fellows also participate in weekly formal learning activities through U - M Integrative Medicine and the Department of Family Medicine .
Financial support is provided to achieve competency in one defined core curricular area . [ … ]
Graduates of this program will model best practices in integrative health care by embracing healing - oriented medicine that takes into account the whole person ( body , mind and spirit ) , including all aspects of lifestyle .
This philosophy emphasizes therapeutic relationships and recognizes use of all appropriate therapies , both conventional and alternative .
W5 indeed .
Notice how no mention is made of science or the scientific basis of any of these therapies .
To read the educational objectives is to see just how little science matters in IM .
All of this is yet another in the series of my characteristically self - indulgently logorrheic introductions to an analysis of a study .
It turns out that U. of M. is trying to do something resembling science about CAM .
The problem is that , like many investigators and universities do , it ’s falling for the same problems and fallacies when true believers try to do what Harriet Hall has so delightfully termed “ Tooth Fairy science . ”
I never thought I ’d be saying it , but it looks as though my alma mater is doing a bit of the ol ’ Tooth Fairy science .
Several readers sent me this study , and , since it came from U. of M. , I figured it falls upon me , among the SBM bloggers , to take it on .
Let us start with how I found out about this study , a credulous article published last week and entitled Acupuncture boosts effects of painkillers , natural or prescription :
High - tech images of the brains of chronic pain sufferers have found that the ancient practice of acupuncture fights pain by making key brain cells more sensitive to the pain - dampening effects of opioid chemicals .
The study , published online in the August issue of the journal NeuroImage , comes less than a year after the publication of a controversial study that concluded acupuncture was no more effective than sham treatment at reducing pain .
Researchers at the University of Michigan ’s Chronic Pain and Fatigue Research Center used a positron emission tomography ( PET ) scanner to view the brains of 20 women diagnosed with fibromyalgia who reported suffering nerve and muscle pain at least 50 % of the time .
The PET scans were conducted during each woman ’s first acupuncture session and , a month later , her eighth .
In the regions of the brain that process and dampen pain signals — the amygdala , caudate , cingula , thalamus and insula — the PET scans showed an increase in the receptivity — and possibly the number — of brain cells to which opioid substances bind .
Study author Richard E. Harris said that suggests that acupuncture appears to make the body more responsive to opioid painkillers .
It turns out that Dr. Harris is not only a molecular biologist but a licensed acupuncturist , which goes to show just how much people can compartmentalize science and belief , walling them off from each other .
There are , not unexpectedly , methodological problems with this article that render its conclusions questionable , but in reality it ’s more a problem of interpretation .
There ’s a famous line from The Princess Bride , where the character Inigo Montoya says of a word , “ I do not think it means what you think it means . ”
In the case of this study , I would paraphrase that famous line to say , “ I do not think your results mean what you think they mean . ”
Here ’s why .
Harris acknowledges up front that several studies have now shown acupuncture to be no more efficacious than sham acupuncture .
Indeed , we have written about such studies right here on SBM that show that acupuncture is no more effective than sham acupuncture .
It does n’t matter if the sham acupuncture is needles inserted in the “ wrong ” acupuncture points or fake needles that do not penetrate the skin or even toothpicks .
The most reasonable scientific conclusion from all of these studies is that acupuncture , as practiced by adherents of traditional Chinese medicine , does not work .
At the very best , it ’s a nonspecific effect that does n’t rely on anything resembling a system .
More likely , acupuncture is nothing more than an elaborate placebo .
None of this , however , stops Harris ’ group from trying to show that there is a different between sham acupuncture and real acupuncture at some sort of level , and this study is their attempt to do just that .
Here is the background as Harris states it in the introduction to his study , entitled Traditional Chinese acupuncture and placebo ( sham ) acupuncture are differentiated by their effects on μ- opioid receptors ( MORs ) :
Recent controversy in the field of acupuncture research was generated when several large scale randomized controlled trials in chronic pain patients failed to show superiority of acupuncture over sham acupuncture methods ( Brinkhaus et al. , 2006 ; Linde et al. , 2005 ; Melchart et al. , 2005 ; Harris et al. , 2005 ) .
This has lead opponents of acupuncture therapy to suggest that it is no more effective than a placebo intervention .
Since placebo administration also induces activation of opioid receptors , specifically the μ-opioid receptor ( MOR ) class ( Benedetti and Amanzio , 1997 ; Zubieta et al. , 2005 ; Amanzio and Benedetti , 1999 ; Levine et al. , 1978 ; Pomeranz and Chiu , 1976 ) , acupuncture may indeed operate in part via placebo mechanisms .
There ’s almost certainly no “ may ” about it , and you can also almost certainly safely scratch “ in part , ” but that ’s just me being a nasty skeptic or , as I like to think , a good scientist .
I also find it curious why Harris would refer to investigators who are telling it like it is , so to speak , and pointing out accurately what these studies show “ opponents ” of acupuncture .
It suggests a bit of an adversarial , defensive , “ I ’ll show you ” mindset right from the start .
Be that as it may , the hypothesis to be studied is that long term acupuncture therapy somehow results in increased μ- opioid receptor availability and that this effect would not be seen in a sham acupuncture group .
Harris chose fibromyalgia ( FM ) patients for his study because previous work of his had shown that FM patients have reduced central μ- opioid receptor ( MOR ) binding potential .
In that study patients with greater clinical pain were found to have reduced MOR binding potential , and Dr. Harris wondered if acupuncture could somehow increase that binding potential and thus relieve pain .
Thus , this study is the classic example of a researcher taking a technique developed for the study of one question and applying it to another question , and what Harris asks is whether acupuncture and sham acupuncture have different ( or any ) effects on these receptors .
Specifically , the technique used is positron emission tomography ( PET ) designed to look at the binding of opioids to these receptors using 11C - carfentanil ( CFN ) positron emission tomography ( PET ) with the μ-opioid selective radiotracer [ 11C ] carfentanil .
The study involved randomizing 20 women with FM into one of two groups , either sham acupuncture or “ real ” acupuncture .
Subjects were blinded to which group they were in , but investigators were not , and a questionnaire was given to see if patients could guess what group they were in .
The results in each group were no more accurate than random chance , suggesting that patient blinding , at least , was good .
It was not clear to me , however , from the text whether those who were evaluating the PET scans were also blinded to which experimental group each patient was in .
That is such a mind - numbingly obviously necessary part of designing any imaging experiment such as this that I will assume that the physicians reading the scans were in fact blinded to what experimental group each scan came from , but it ’s disturbing that this very basic experimental design point was n’t explicitly stated anywhere .
Also , it ’s clear that the investigators doing the acupuncture or sham acupuncture were not blinded .
There are now retractable sham needles available that do a pretty good job of hiding from even acupuncturists whether a real needle went in or not ; I wonder why those were n’t used .
In any case , there were no significant differences between the groups with respect to demographics or initial pain scores , and patients were excluded who : had previous experience with acupuncture ; had current use or a history of use of opioid or narcotic analgesics ; had a history of substance abuse ; had the presence of a known coagulation abnormality , thrombocytopenia , or bleeding diathesis that may preclude the safe use of acupuncture ; had the presence of concurrent autoimmune or inflammatory disease ; had concurrent participation in other therapeutic trials ; were pregnant and nursing mothers ; had severe psychiatric illnesses ; or had contraindications to PET .
Outcome measures included clinical pain scores using the Short Form of the McGill Pain Questionnaire and measures of μ - opioid binding .
As in many other studies of acupuncture versus sham acupuncture , non-insertional sham needles were used for the sham acupuncture procedure .
Patients underwent a total of nine acupuncture or sham acupuncture treatments over the course of a month , undergoing PET scans at treatment # 1 and tretament # 9 .
At each of the two PET sessions , study participants first underwent a baseline scan for minutes 10 - 40 after infusion of the radiotracer , then the acupuncture or sham procedure , then another scan at 45 - 90 minutes .
The researchers reported both short term increases in μ- opioid binding in various parts of the brain involved in sensory processing , including the cingulate , amygdala , insula , thalamus , and caudate .
Longer term increases in MOR binding were also observed in a subset of the same structures , including the cingulate , caudate , and amygdala .
There were no such increases in the sham acupuncture group , and in some regions small reductions of MOR binding were observed .
Consistent with the other acupuncture studies that Harris mentioned , there was no difference in pain scores between the sham and “ true ” acupuncture groups .
Well , at least that much is consistent with previous results .
Here ’s one big problem with this study .
Needles were retained for the acupuncture group , but there were no needles in the sham acupuncture group because no needles had been inserted .
It ’s not clear to me from the methods whether the sham needles were left attached to the skin or not .
Even if the subject were blindfolded , as these subjects were , I would think that would be very important in order to make the groups as much “ alike ” as possible .
Whatever the true case was , the fact remains that , during the second PET scan period there was a definite difference between the two groups .
The “ true acupuncture ” group had needles sticking into their skin at acupuncture points .
The sham acupuncture group did not .
Could n’t that more or less completely explain the short term results ?
In essence , what Harris studied was differences in neurobiology between subjects who had needles sticking out of their skin and those who did not .
Here ’s the second big problem .
Take a look at this figure , which is Figure 1B from the paper :
Notice something ?
The “ true acupuncture ” ( left side , in red ) procedure is not only different from the sham in that the sham does n’t actually insert any needles .
It uses different locations !
The text calls them “ similar ” because they are in the same body part .
Not how , for example , sham point # 1 is on the head , but not in the same location as Du 20 ) ; sham point # 2 is on the ear but on the earlobe instead of the pinna ; sham point # 3 is on the anterior surface of the right arm instead of the posterior surface of the left arm ; most of the sham points in the leg are on the thigh , rather than the lower leg , where the “ true ” acupuncture points are .
Does anyone see a problem with this ?
I do .
In designing a good placebo control for an acupuncture study ( or any other randomized clinical study ) , you should n’t , if you can possibly help it , mix and match changes in the procedure to produce your sham procedure .
When you choose a sham acupuncture procedure , either insert the needles as usual in the “ wrong ” places or use the sham needles that do n’t pierce the skin in the “ right ” places .
Or have two groups and compare both .
Do n’t place sham needles that do n’t pierce the skin in the “ wrong ” places .
That ’s two differences between the sham procedure and acupuncture and opens the door to a lot of confounders .
Again , could n’t this using a sham procedure that uses the “ wrong ” points and needles that do n’t pierce the skin also partially explain the results of this study ?
Could n’t the combination of using different locations and no insertion for the sham confound the results sufficiently as to render the results of this study virtually meaningless .
I argue that they potentially can .
I ca n’t prove it , but certainly the methodological shortcomings of this trial make it hard to take as any definitive evidence that there is different neurobiology going on between real acupuncture and sham acupuncture .
All it does is to show that maybe there is a neurobiological difference between having needles sticking out of the skin and not having needles sticking out of the skin , which would be of little surprise , although the exact difference could be of interest .
What this study does not show is that acupuncture “ works . ”
I suppose it ’s possible that sticking needles in the skin may have nonspecific effects that might alleviate pain , but this very study shows that they are no different than placebo .
After all , there was no difference in pain relief between subjects receiving sham acupuncture and real acupuncture .
Both experienced the same amount of subjective pain relief !
Not that that stops Harris from trying to imply that sham and true acupuncture “ work ” through different mechanisms :
Another intriguing result from the present study is that although MOR BP values were differentially altered by TA and SA , reduction in clinical pain was similar between groups .
In a clinical trial , when an active treatment does not exhibit superior efficacy to a sham or placebo , the active treatment is assumed to be ineffective and only operating via a placebo effect .
However this study suggests that this may be an erroneous conclusion .
In this instance , our non-insertion sham procedure evoked a similar reduction in pain as our true acupuncture and we speculate that this occurred via a different mechanism .
The analgesic effects of SA could have been due to regional reductions in MOR BP , consistent with activation of this class of receptors during placebo effects ( Zubieta et al. , 2005 ) , whereas TA evoked an increase in receptor binding availability .
Alternatively , the perceived pain relief accorded by sham acupuncture and true acupuncture could be occurring by placebo mechanisms entirely unrelated to the observation of this study , which may have had nothing to do with the clinical placebo effects seen .
That ’s a rather more simple explanation for these results than all that handwaving ( and , yes , it is mostly handwaving ) in the paragraph above .
I ’m rather surprised the reviewers did n’t make Harris revise his manuscript to consider this possibility and discuss it .
Harris could be correct .
I doubt that he is , but he could be .
However , my alternate explanation could also be correct .
Moreover , even if he is correct , so what ?
It might be intellectually interesting and useful for understanding the placebo effect to determine the differences in neurobiology underlying two different placebo treatments , but none of this validates acupuncture as anything more than an elaborate placebo .
It ’s also a long run for a short slide , so to speak , in that nine sessions in a month of sticking needles into the body seems a lot to undergo for such minimal results based on such tenuous mechanisms .
It ’s also depressing to see how the press has spun this study .
Reports on the study are more or less reporting it exactly as Harris represented his results in the Discussion section of his paper .
I have yet to see a news story with anything more than a very token skeptical view .
Instead , they all proclaim this study as evidence that acupuncture can somehow crank up the level of opioid receptors to the point where they make opioid drugs work better .
Heck , the article I cited said that this study shows that acupuncture can increase the efficacy of opioid analgesics , either natural or prescription !
There ’s zero evidence presented in this paper that shows that .
This paper represents to me the latest in a line of rationalizations of acupuncture .
Acupuncturists start out saying that “ acupuncture works ” based on nonblinded studies for which placebo effects are not adequately controlled for .
Then , when better studies show that true acupuncture is no better than sham acupuncture ( or , amusingly , sometimes that the sham acupuncture “ works ” better ) , they rationalize it by saying either that the sham was not a good sham or that these studies do n’t say anything because sham acupuncture “ works ” too .
Harris takes a different tack in saying that , yes , there ’s no difference in perceived pain due to sham acupuncture or true acupuncture not only because they both work but because they both work by different physiological mechanisms .
He might have had a ( weak ) point were it not for his seemingly willful misinterpretation of his results and his changing too many things at the same time in his sham control group .
Instead , all he ’s shown is that opioid receptors light up more if there are needles in the skin than they do if there are not–hardly a finding that shows that acupuncture “ works ” and certainly not any sort of finding to validate the entire system of acupuncture , which relies upon the idea of qi flowing through meridians , flows that can be altered to therapeutic effect by sticking needles into those meridians .
“ I do not think your results mean what you think they mean , ” indeed .

Stories about polygamy tend to surge and ebb in the media , but they never fail to intrigue people .
Recently in South Africa , a Zulu man married four women–all at once–making the most popular story on the BBC news website ( you can watch the clip here ) .
In the video , a male wedding guest gives a thumbs - up to the marriage (s ) , claiming that the “ world ” suffers from monogamous marriage breakdowns as a result of adultery .
Later , the narrator serves up a classic : with all those wives , what man will have time to cheat ?
So , yes , it seems to be all about sex and keeping the man carnally satiated as to not go astray .
But what do the wives have to say ?
From the wives ’ perspective , there is Hatijah Aam , founder of the Ikhwan Polygamy Club in Malaysia .
Running what sounds like a matchmaking service , Hatijah herself had introduced her husband to a future co-wife , a mother of seven .
The club has been successful at marrying men and women from neighboring Thailand and Indonesia , and even as far as Australia .
The virtues of polygamy , according to her , echo the stuff in religious texts I ’ve become so accustomed to : it helps single mothers , “ old maids ” , and former sex workers ( a new addition ! ) out of what is ostensibly abject misery .
Looking at the social context in Malaysia , it ’s understandable how polygynous relationships can thrive : women are chronically at an economic disadvantage , a female - initiated divorce is a difficult , laborious process , and if it is successful , women shoulder the stigma and burden of being fair game to any Malay - Muslim man .
Pinning on former sex workers , single mothers , and divorcees the label “ unwanted goods ” says a lot about the precarious status women have in society ; women are not only defined by their marital ( and sexual ) status , but also seem to lack agency to better themselves .
For a while I ’ve been interested in what women in polygamous marriages have to say about their relationship with their husband , co-wives , and with their faith , particularly when feminist buzz words like “ choice ” , “ rights ” , and “ consent ” are used .
Take for instance this argument : in a monogamous marriage , a woman has the right to choose her spouse , and so in principle a woman should also have the same kind of rights to allow her husband to marry another .
It will be interesting when the role of rights and agency are raised in response to legislation against polygamy in numerous countries across the globe .
There ’s also an argument that “ feminist ” polygyny allows women “ to have it all ” : work hard and have a great arrangement with co-wives who will look after their kids ( providing of course that the co-wives are n’t so career - minded ) .
Like polyamory and open marriages , polygamy is not common for obvious reasons , with jealousy being the main one .
And while for the few women whose rights are respected and protected ( in some countries ) , how do their choices impact on all other women in general ?
Will a concept of polygamy that is truly women - centric subvert a system in which some women see sharing a husband the only way out of economic or social hardship ?
Will every wife have a happy sex life ?
Tightening conditions on such marriages may appear as posing restrictions on a woman who wants to express her rights , but at the same restricts men from marrying women for exploitative reasons often disguised as noble ones .
In Indonesia , laws are made increasingly lax to accommodate men who wish to tie the knot multiple times , even if they lack the financial means ( or the guts ) to tell their first wives .
Polygyny , alongside housewifery and pornography , is just one of the few issues women have been grappling with distinguishing between whether it ’s feminist or not .
And so a belief in ending oppression in all its many guises should be the compass of every feminist if one finds themselves lost .
To end , I leave you with Hatijah Aam saying that polygamy should be something beautiful , rather than something disgusting .
I say , fair enough–keeping in mind that beauty is in the eye of the beholder .
Burden of Proof : The Precautionary Principle An Interview with Peter Montague Peter Montague is director of the Environmental Research Foundation in New Brunswick , New Jersey .
He was the longtime editor of Rachel ’s Environment and Health News , an incisive weekly newsletter which recently ceased publication after its 1000th issue .
He has co-authored two books on toxic heavy metals in the natural environment and is presently writing a book about the precautionary principle .
Multinational Monitor :
What is the precautionary principle ?
Peter Montague :
The precautionary principle is a way of making decisions about things we care about , especially when we 're not sure we have all the information we think we need .
It 's a way of making decisions in the face of uncertainty .
The overarching goal of precaution is to minimize harm to present and future generations and to the ecosystems on which all life depends .
There are really three things that distinguish the precautionary approach from more traditional decision - making .
First , precaution assumes that the proponents of a product or project should provide evidence that ( a ) they have looked at all reasonable alternatives and are going about their business in the least harmful way possible ; and ( b ) their activities are not likely to degrade human health or the natural environment .
Second , precautionary decision - making engages the people who will be affected by a decision - really engages them .
At least that 's what 's supposed to happen .
Instead of the five - minute democracy so typical at public hearings in the U.S. , where citizens are given five minutes to comment , precaution urges an extensive process of engaging citizens in decisions .
Finally , because precaution is used when we are uncertain about the consequences of our actions , precaution urges us to monitor the consequences of our decisions and be prepared to alter course if things are turning out badly .
Therefore , precaution favors decisions that can be reversed , avoiding irretrievable commitments .
MM : Does n't the precautionary principle put an impossible burden on companies to show something is not unsafe ?
Montague : Not really .
When a drug company wants to market a new drug , we ask them to provide reasonable evidence of no harm and we ask them to show that their new product will do some good ( they must show " efficacy " ) .
The assumption is that a new drug will be harmful or useless ( or both ) and it's up to the company to prove otherwise .
The burden of proof is on the company promoting the new drug , not on the public ( or their government ) to provide persuasive information .
The precautionary principle applies these same ideas more generally .
Using the precautionary principle , decision makers can ask whether products or projects are being done in the least - harmful way possible , and they might ask the proponents to reveal who 's going to get the benefits and who 's going to be saddled with the harm .
A side benefit of this approach is that we can assess the fairness of a proposed activity .
Conceivably , precaution could lead to a really fundamental question , such as , " Do we need this at all ?
Does it provide any real benefits to anyone ? "
Of course , even the best scientific efforts to anticipate problems with a product or project can fail to foresee problems - even serious problems .
Think of the ozone layer being depleted by refrigeration chemicals .
Unpleasant surprises are a regular feature of modern industrial life , so , after we make a decision , we must monitor carefully and be prepared to alter course when necessary .
MM : How does the precautionary principle compare to the cost - benefit analysis approach to risk ?
Montague :
As lawyer - scientist Joseph Guth has shown in a series of scholarly papers , cost - benefit analysis enjoys a special status in U.S. law and policy .
From the mid-19th century onward , U.S. law was designed to promote economic growth .
With few exceptions , statutory law , common law and government regulations all presume that economic growth provides net benefits ( more benefits than costs ) to society until an explicit cost - benefit analysis can show otherwise .
Even when considerable harm is acknowledged , the starting presumption is that economic growth provides more benefits than costs .
Therefore , faced with uncertainty , ignorance or doubt , the law presumes that economic growth should continue - until an explicit cost - benefit analysis can show conclusively that the costs to society outweigh any benefits .
Given the starting presumption , it is up to the public ( or their government ) to show that costs exceed benefits .
If they fail to meet that burden , an economic activity can continue .
As you can see , under these assumptions , scientific uncertainty , doubt and ignorance allow economic activity to continue , even when it is acknowledged to be causing substantial harm .
This has led to the rise of an industry devoted to the creation of uncertainty and doubt .
David Michaels has described this industry in his excellent book , Doubt is Their Product .
The precautionary principle shifts the starting assumption .
Precaution assumes that , in the modern world , a product or project is likely to be harmful , just the way U.S. food and drug law assumes a new drug is harmful or useless or both .
Shifting this assumption is necessary because the world has been badly damaged by the cost - benefit approach in which all economic activities are assumed to produce more benefits than harms .
The world is now burdened with a growing list of very substantial harms - global warming ; ozone layer depletion ; species going extinct at roughly 1,000 times the historical rate ; male fish turning into female fish in essentially all fresh waters of the U.S. ; a majority of marine fisheries depleted or badly overfished ; many chronic diseases increasing ( e.g. , asthma , diabetes , childhood cancers , attention deficits , autism spectrum disorder , etc. ) ; girls reaching puberty earlier than in the past ; several kinds of birth defects increasing .
This list could be readily extended .
Given that the world is experiencing this perfect storm of environment and health problems , the precautionary principle shifts the burden of proof onto economic actors , asking them to show that they are ( a ) doing things in the least harmful way possible , and ( b ) the harms they are adding to the system will not degrade human health or the natural environment .
The assumption of cost - benefit analysis has always been that benefits and their associated , though lesser , costs can grow without limit .
The law assumes that , to achieve some benefit , the Earth and the human species can absorb costs without limit .
But we can see from the short and very incomplete catalog of problems mentioned previously , that we have exceeded the Earth 's capacity to absorb harm - we are degrading the capacity of the planet to support human life .
It is worth pointing out that , so far as anyone knows , this planet is the only place in the universe that is hospitable to our species .
Earth is our only home .
So we are toying with the destruction of the place that sustains us , threatening the future of our species .
As Joe Guth points out , the loss of the planet as a suitable habitat for humans would be an infinite loss for our species .
Under these circumstances , justifying more costs by claiming that the benefits are large is ultimately suicidal .
If we have exceeded the planet 's capacity to sustain and regenerate itself from harm , we are therefore threatening our own existence - so further damage to the planet must be avoided regardless of any benefits promised .
This means that cost - benefit analysis is no longer a useful approach to decisions and should be abandoned .
In its place , we need to examine every decision that could impact the Earth and human health from a precautionary perspective , asking whether it is likely to degrade the planet further , or harm human health further - and we must now always ask whether a product or project is being approached in the least - harmful way possible .
Cost - benefit analysis asks , " Is this harm justified by related benefits ? "
If the answer is yes , or even if the answer is unknown , the harm is allowed to continue .
The precautionary principal asks , " Is this harm avoidable ? "
MM : Business groups contrast the precautionary principle to " a science - based approach to risk management . "
Is this a legitimate contrast ?
Montague : I would say not .
As Joe Guth has pointed out , the precautionary approach is actually far more scientific than the current decision - making structure based on cost - benefit analysis .
The presumptions built into our current legal decision - structure are profoundly unscientific .
The basic assumption is that the planet has an infinite capacity to absorb harm from human economic activities , and that therefore human activities can continue to impose costs on the global ecosystem without limit .
So long as benefits outweigh costs , the system assumes costs can continue to accumulate forever .
However , thousands of scientific studies have shown that the global ecosystem has already suffered substantial - and in some cases irreparable - harm and is being permanently degraded .
The cumulative impact of millions of small costs - each of which could be justified by a cost - benefit analysis - has degraded the planet .
So we can see that our regulatory system is based on a premise that scientists know is no longer valid .
Despite this , regulators and judges are not legally allowed to acknowledge this fatal flaw in the cost - benefit approach because of the presumptions built into our laws and regulations .
In cost - benefit analysis , scientific uncertainty is usually not factored in .
Missing data is assigned a value of zero and is usually not considered at all .
On the other hand , the precautionary approach considers scientific uncertainty a reasonable basis for action - precautionary action to avoid harm .
Here again , we see the precautionary approach using the full spectrum of scientific information while cost - benefit analysis ignores important scientific data .
In sum , it is the cost - benefit approach that is unscientific , not the precautionary approach .
MM : To what extent , if any , is the precautionary principle evident in U.S. environmental law ?
Or other areas of the law ?
Montague :
As I mentioned , U.S. food and drug law takes a precautionary approach , assuming that new drugs are harmful or useless or both , and putting the burden on drug companies to prove otherwise .
The Endangered Species Act ( ESA ) requires all government agencies to avoid actions that might harm a species that has been designated as " threatened " or " endangered , " even if this proves to be very costly .
The ESA does not require cost - benefit analysis of proposed actions to show that protecting endangered species is " worth it . "
The law assumes that protecting an endangered species is worth the cost .
Some parts of the Clean Air Act and the Clean Water Act require that standards be set to protect human and environmental health without any cost - benefit balancing .
So there are instances of a precautionary approach built into several U.S. environmental statutes .
But these are exceptions to the general rule that still guides most of our laws and regulations , namely that benefits are assumed to outweigh costs , and costs are assumed to be able to grow without limit .
In general , the law assumes that the Earth can absorb unlimited harm and that no one has a right to curtail harm unless they can show that the harm is " unreasonable " - meaning that its social costs exceed its social benefits .
Absent such a showing , the harmful activity gets to continue .
MM : To what extent , if any , is the precautionary principle evident in other countries ' environmental law ?
Montague : Precautionary thinking is spreading everywhere .
The European Union adopted the precautionary principle in its founding document , the Maastricht Treaty of 1990 .
The United Nations adopted a version of the precautionary principle in the Rio Declaration of 1992 .
The nation of Bhutan recently wrote the precautionary principle into its new constitution .
New Zealand is taking a precautionary approach to management of its fisheries - erring on the side of caution by setting strict limits on commercial fishing .
More than 50 Canadian cities have outlawed the use of pesticides for cosmetic purposes on lawns - on the assumption that pesticides are intrinsically dangerous and will eventually cause some harm to humans and other forms of life .
These are just a few examples of precaution being slowly adopted around the world .
Clearly , this is an idea whose time has come .
MM : What has been the impact of the European precautionary - based rules on chemicals , electronic waste and other areas ?
Has business eviscerated them ?
Have the rules eviscerated business ?
Montague :
It 's too early to tell what the consequences will be of the new European chemicals policy called REACH ( Registration , Evaluation and Authorization of Chemicals ) .
The basic idea of REACH is that industrial chemicals should be tested for health and environmental effects before they are marketed , just as drugs must be tested for safety and efficacy before they can be sold .
U.S. chemical firms will have to comply with these laws if they want to sell chemicals in Europe , which is a huge market .
It seems likely that the chemical industry - for all its bellyaching and posturing - will have little trouble complying with the law and that , as a result , many dangerous chemicals will be withdrawn from the market and replaced by less dangerous alternatives .
The effort in this country to create " green chemistry " has been given a big boost by Europe 's adoption of REACH , though green chemistry remains insignificantly small compared to the industrial apparatus still devoted to chlorine chemistry .
MM : How has the U.S. government responded to precautionary initiatives in Europe ?
Montague :
The full force and power of the U.S. Treasury has been arrayed against Europe , trying to derail - or at least defang - the REACH chemicals policy .
REACH is far weaker than when it started out , thanks in large part to illegal meddling by the U.S. government and U.S. corporations like Monsanto in internal policies of the European Union .
Furthermore , through the World Trade Organization and the U.S. Trade Representative , the American government has done its best to overturn specific precautionary policies such as those I 've mentioned - European distrust of meat treated with hormones and distaste for all foods grown from genetically engineered seed .
The U.S. is doing its best to hold back the tide of precautionary thinking that has spread outward from Europe .
MM : What needs to be done to make the precautionary principle a governing principle for environmental policymaking ?
Montague : First , to make any really substantial changes in environmental policy - or in any important social policies , for that matter - we would have to get private money out of our elections .
So long as you have to spend millions of dollars to seek even the least - costly national office , and so long as private parties can provide those monies , national offices will be held only by people who are themselves wealthy or who are beholden to wealthy patrons .
To point out the obvious again , the system is working just fine for the super - rich corporate elite , and they have no interest in reforming it , to put it mildly .
So until we can pry their hands off the steering wheel - by eliminating the power of their money to control our elections - we wo n't be able to make the needed policy changes .
We may be able to nibble around the edges of what 's needed , but real reform will remain out of reach , and we will continue down the path that ultimately leads to the extinction of our species .
Second , the environmental advocacy apparatus - I think we can no longer justify calling it a " movement " - would have to embrace the precautionary principle and make it a multi- year campaign priority .
And , to really do that , they would have to acknowledge the power of private money to prevent the needed policy changes .
Furthermore , the grassroots and environmental - justice - oriented groups would have to confront the reality that many of the Big Green groups in D.C. have morphed into corporate front groups , promoting corporate - friendly environmental policies rather than putting a priority on protecting the global ecosystem from degradation using a precautionary approach .
We tend to paper over these differences and pretend that they are not fundamentally important , but they are .
Specifically , Environmental Defense and its followers need to be outed and confronted and their funding diverted to grassroots groups that actually want to make the needed changes .
Furthermore , those grassroots groups need a physical and intellectual infrastructure to make it possible for them to become a real social movement .
Social movements cannot be created , but their advent can be anticipated and prepared for .
MM : What needs to be done to make the precautionary principle a governing principle for economic policymaking , nationally and globally ?
And is that something to which we should aspire ?
Montague :
We should aspire to making precautionary thinking second nature .
Just as it would be unthinkable to re-introduce chattel slavery in the U.S. , we should aim to make it unthinkable to undertake a project or product without examining all available alternatives to find the least harmful way .
We should put the burden of proof of safety and efficacy onto all economic actors .
As our technologies grow ever - more powerful and therefore ever - more dangerous , we need to alter the approach that the U.S. has favored for 200 years , which is roughly , " Damn the torpedoes , full speed ahead , nothing ventured , nothing gained . "
We need to embrace and champion those opposing threads that are woven throughout our culture : A stitch in time saves nine ;
Better safe than sorry ; First , do no harm .
The precautionary principle offers guidance for living - it counsels us to combine all the tools of science and ancient wisdom to avoid harm .
In the case of economic policies , we know that the root cause of environmental destruction is an ever - expanding human economy .
We therefore know we need to develop an economy that can grow but does n't have to grow .
The so - called Third World needs growth - they need ports , power plants , roads , schools , hospitals .
But on a planet where the human economy has already exceeded some of the Earth 's capacity for self - renewal , the overdeveloped countries would have to shrink their economies to make room for the growth that is needed in the Global South .
At present this is unthinkable because our economy exists in only two states : it 's either growing or collapsing .
The idea of a steady - state economy , or an economy that is shrinking in an orderly fashion , is not yet thinkable .
That will have to change if we want to avoid destroying our only home .
How can we make such deep changes ?
Again , we 've got to get private money out of our elections , so that ordinary people with good ideas and good sense can afford to run for office .
Until we eliminate private money from our elections , the needed changes can be imagined and designed and described , but they can not be implemented .
MM : The world is amidst a deepening recession .
Does the precautionary principle offer guidance on how policymakers should respond ?
Montague :
The precautionary principle is basically a prevention strategy , aiming to prevent harm .
Unfortunately , as Naomi Klein shows in her extraordinarily insightful book , The Shock Doctine , the corporate elite has learned to thrive on trouble , so preventing trouble is not in their interests .
Their power will have to be diminished very substantially before we can develop an economy and a mindset aimed at preventing harm to individuals and communities .
The present global recession fits right into the pattern described by Naomi Klein .
For example , the recession is decimating the not - for - profit sector in the U.S. , leaving the people who created this recession with ever more centralized , unopposed power .
Taxpayers are being forced to bail out these shrewd billionaires on the theory that we can't get along without them .
It is essentially a coup d'etat by Wall Street .
It is unclear where this will lead but in the short term it will make real change even more difficult than before .
As Paul Krugman pointed out recently in the New York Times , the people making U.S. economic policies remain wedded to Reaganesque so - called " free market " policies .
Their idea of success is to continue the policies that have brought the world to its knees .
So " change we can believe in " turns out to be just more of the same old same old .
A precautionary economics would begin by aiming to develop strong local economies , intended to make communities more self - sufficient and therefore more resilient in the face of the " gales of destruction " we have come to expect from so - called " free - market " capitalism .
Here the work of Jane Jacobs , David Morris and Michael Shuman comes to mind .
They have championed the idea that communities should aim for self - sufficiency to the extent possible , using their economic development resources to promote local businesses that are locally owned and operated .
MM : How can municipalities and states incorporate the precautionary principle into their policymaking ?
Montague : First , they could incorporate it into a law .
San Francisco has done that , as has Lyndhurst , New Jersey .
Joe Guth has developed a model ordinance for municipalities and states to consider .
Secondly , they could incorporate precaution into their economic development policies , aiming to create robust , resilient local and regional economies , as mentioned above .
This would include a strategy for controlling the behavior of corporations .
The modern corporation is largely unaccountable and has only one legal purpose - to return a modicum of profit to its shareholders .
It must do this without regard to consequences for the local economy .
So community resilience requires new ways of controlling corporate behavior .
Third , they could monitor and measure community well - being , inventory - ing community assets and " the commons , " for example , and regularly report on the " state of the community . "
The commons includes common assets , common property and common wealth .
It includes nature - air , water , soil , wildlife , habitat , and so on - but it also includes language , accumulated knowledge , relationships of respect and trust , and it includes libraries , roads , public open space , and so on .
Government is the trustee of the commons and it should offer a trustee 's report every few years .
Trends are important , and can provide the basis for precautionary action to avert harm .
Fourth , they could adopt an idea developed jointly by the Indigenous Environmental Network ( IEN ) and the Science & Environmental Health Network ( SEHN ) - creating the position of " guardian of the future " as a municipal or state office .
The guardian would have responsibility for thinking about the long - term consequences of present trends and policies .
Fifth , they could adopt zero waste policies , aiming for clean production , and cradle - to - cradle management of products designed for endless reuse .
MM : Is the precautionary principle relevant for developing countries ?
Does it presume or require more scientific or regulatory capacity than many developing countries have ?
Does it require forsaking wealth creation in societies that are too poor to afford the luxury ?
Montague :
The precautionary principle can work in any social setting .
It is a flexible approach to decision - making intended to avoid harm to humans and the ecosystems on which they depend .
Of course , the overdeveloped world has made life more difficult than necessary for the Third World , imposing requirements on them that we do not impose on ourselves ( insisting that they end farm subsidies , for example , while we continue to subsidize our farmers to the tune of tens of billions of dollars each year ) .
Despite this , the Third World can adopt a precautionary approach to decision - making just as we can .
Precaution is an overarching philosophy that can be adapted to any social setting .
McKinnon backs Miller vs. ' disrespectful partisan idiot '
Mark McKinnon , the Bush adman who has denounced his party 's excesses , is backing Democrat Rob Miller against Rep.
Joe Wilson of South Carolina , McKinnon just wrote :
Make Joe Wilson pay .
And by pay , I mean beat his sorry ass at the polls and send him to the private sector .
That is the only way to change the political discourse in America today .
Because as long as louts like Joe Wilson can spout off and call the president a liar and get rewarded with re-election , then louts will continue to spout off .
And we will continue to claw out way to the very bottom of the political swamp .
[ snip ]
I ’m a Republican , but I ’d rather have a Democrat in Congress who I may disagree with but who has some fundamental character and decency which Wilson clearly lacks .
So , today I ’m volunteering for Republicans for Rob Miller , Wilson ’s opponent , a former Marine and Iraq veteran , and am sending him a $ 1,000 check ....
There ’s only one way to we ’re going to change our political climate and ensure we establish some respect in our discourse .
And that is to show there is a real price to pay for being a disrespectful partisan idiot .
Send Joe Wilson home .
' Camp Greyhound ' outpost of law and order
By Kevin Johnson , USA TODAY
NEW ORLEANS  Claude Moman wanted out of this flood - ravaged city so much Thursday , police say , that he stole a rental car and made a dash for the downtown Greyhound bus station , hoping to buy a ticket out of here .
Inmates wait to go back to their cells inside a temporary jail facility at the Greyhound bus station in New Orleans .
By Omar Torres , AFP / Getty Images
What Moman did n't know was that hours earlier , Louisiana prison authorities had commandeered the station and transformed it into a makeshift jail .
Moman , 30 , thus became the first arrestee to be held at what the state Department of Corrections has dubbed " Camp Greyhound . "
The new jail , which features chain - link holding cells topped by razor wire in what used to be the station 's parking areas , became necessary when the city 's justice complex was flooded .
Its opening was among the first signals that authorities were gaining their footing against the looting and violence that plagued New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina hit .
Since the terminal was taken over by law enforcement authorities , it has become the new face of justice in this devastated city .
More than 220 people have been detained there before being moved elsewhere to await trial .
Most of those passing through Camp Greyhound have been accused of looting , but there also have been a few accused killers and rapists , said Burl Cain , a state prison warden who oversees the jail .
In the chaotic days after Katrina hit Aug. 29 , looters and other suspected criminals often were issued citations and set free by police because there was no place to put them .
Many of those caught and released by police simply returned to looting , Cain said .
" You have to have a jail before you can have security , " Cain said .
State and federal prosecutors work in the lobby of the bus station .
Looking for the Orleans Parish District Attorney 's Office ?
Head to the gift shop .
The Justice Department has an office near the ticket counter .
Cain has a table at what was formerly a Subway sandwich shop .
As suspects arrive , prosecutors decide whether they should face state or federal charges .
Photographs and fingerprints are taken before the suspects are moved to the outdoor , covered holding cells , which are watched by armed guards .
At least 50 prisoners were there Thursday , awaiting transfer to U.S. or state custody for hearings .
Federal prisoners are sent to Baton Rouge and Lafayette ; state prisoners go to a facility in St. Gabriel .
About 700 arrestees can be held at the station .
Its cells , which hold about 15 prisoners each , have no cots , mattresses or chairs .
The floor is the asphalt parking lot .
There is one portable toilet per cell .
Meals are military - issue MREs ( meals ready to eat ) .
U.S. GRAVEDIGGERS TO BE FULLY EMPLOYED : SURPRISED ? By Greg Evensen September 19 , 2009 NewsWithViews.com
As most of you are already aware , I broke a story seven months ago in which I described a discussion I had with a friend in the health care profession at a major mid-western hospital .
This person told me about the delivery of stainless steel wrist band type bracelets that carried the hardware for uploading , tracking and broadcasting uniquely personal encoded information .
These bands were to be used in the event of massive inoculations or other disaster events in which large numbers of people would be vaccinated and then tracked .
I also stated that plans for roadblock enforcement of these issued bands was a component of emergency planning already on the federal and state police shelves , for use when those state or federal agencies called for blockades on the movement of people .
I further mentioned that the “ bracelets ” would be encoded on the spot with tools similar to those used by UPS when packages are delivered and scanned by the driver .
I would not release my source for fear of severe retaliation being waged against this individual for obvious reasons .
On September 15th , we were contacted by a friend who said check out the Boston Globe article that has validated every shred of information that I gave earlier this year .
The company that is at the forefront of supplying the City of Boston ’s Health Services Department with this very device is EMSystems of Milwaukee , Wi .
Each one of you are the final arbitrators for the ultimate destiny you will inherit , here and in the next life .
Use this information wisely and prepare for what is inevitable given the direction our nation has been forced into taking .
I am extremely grateful to my precious wife Liz , who dug in and processed the information that revealed this Boston event and EMSystems .
People control efforts through banking , taxes , firearms possession , food , pharmaceuticals , health care , licensing at every phase of life and business , education , military service , and multi level policing agencies , are all so programmed and fatal to individual liberties , that no one alive can deny their reality and the scope of their reach .
Having been raised during the summer months on a farm in central Illinois , I rode an open combine with my grandfather while he harvested tons of seed raised from non -hybrid strains that enriched our cattle and went to market .
Today , we are DYING quicker , with the results of hybrid seeds that if they were human would make Frankenstein look tame .
It is a giant gene war with crop seeds that has no bearing on whether or not it is nutritious , but whether it is profitable .
( Cue the gravediggers )
The same is true with the pharmaceutical companies that labor very moment to shoot drugs or pills into our systems to maintain and “ manage ” disease rather than cure them , because one shot that cures and costs $ 1000 , is nothing compared to tens of thousands over a lifetime by sentencing many to a needle and ultimately death because of a doctor ’s maintaining diabetes or other debilitating ailments .
( Cue the gravediggers , again )
The militarization or weaponized version of the Spanish flu that was extracted from an Alaskan native ’s bones who perished during the 1918 pandemic , may be at the center of the next pandemic — or its “ cure ” depending upon your point of view .
Personally , I simply do not trust anything the government tells me concerning any issue you care to bring up .
I base that on their string of lies and deceit dating back 175 years .
Almost from the very inception of our “ Republic ” it has been about power and money .
Nothing more , nothing less .
Those who rose to power were allowed to do so , by anointed elites both in our nation and Europe .
Nothing has changed .
We are simply seeing the final act played out as most of us bury our heads and promote this insidious and lethal combination of communistic worshipping simpletons , and a government all too willing to use these idiots .
They are too far gone on the government gravy train to know or to ask any questions at all .
Those of us ( and thank GOD for patriots ) who act as human shields for the keyboard warriors who whine and complain but add nothing to the effort to defeat this express train to hell are weary from years of battle .
When the camps begin filling and the roads are mostly empty , the truth of what we have all been saying will cut to the marrow like a razor .
( Cue the gravedigger , yet again )
Advertisement I have advised tens of thousands to have a plan and prepare .
If you have done that , you are light years ahead of the ACORN crowd who are betting their miserable and corrupted lives on ACORN ’S former legal representative Barack Obama .
They and the computerized voting machines that handed this illegitimately elected usurper a national election are enemies of the Republic .
They are the ones who need to be in the internment camps by the millions .
If you do not have a plan and are not prepared , then you are already a casualty .
Hear that mournful music — it ’s the gravedigger and he ’s moving your way .
I have also advised people to think defensively and strategically .
I continue to do that , but the time is coming when that will shift to other strategies that Jefferson admonished us about using when dealing with tyranny .
That day is just ahead dear friends .
I believe there is no way now to avoid it .
It almost MUST come , for the evil that surrounds us cannot be destroyed any other way .
In a perfect world we could talk it out .
We could reason and reach a moral and logical agreement .
Logic , morality , truth , common sense and accountability all went down with the Republic .
Vicious evil and its legions must be eliminated .
The time for debate is over .
The legacy to our children and grandchildren will be utter defeat and evil upon this world unseen since the days of Noah , or a bitter struggle that will stamp out this cancer on our nation , and stand at the doorstep of a new Republic .
( The gravedigger is waiting for our response ) .
Although our “ Castle Defense ” DVD covers much of the opening information you need to know , it is geared for the novice and those without any plan or idea how to create one .
Our second and final DVD , “ Castle Doctrine II ” is a compilation of a two day in - field “ on your bellies in the bush ” planning session held at our wooded home in Michigan .
It will be ready soon and can be purchased alone or as part of a set with the original Castle Doctrine exclusively at our website , www.theheartlandusa.com.
If you can not get to a national seminar somewhere , then this is available to help you .
DVD ’s of the August 6 - 8 gathering in Summersville , W.V. where I emceed a stellar gathering of patriot speakers are available at our site as well .
You MUST have this historic event in your video library .
If I had a very short list of the most essential items to offer you , then this common sense effort might help .
It is basic , but a point to start from .
1 . Do not be immunized .
Resist if you have to .
2. Begin buying “ original ” ( real ) foods from reputable growers .
3 . Use meat products from the same sources .
4. Familiarize yourself with “ home remedies ” and stock those items
5 . Buy only the gold and silver necessary to barter your mortgage , etc .
6 . Stock food , food , food and ammunition .
They will be invaluable .
7. Create home church and Bible studies along with prayer groups .
8 . Start moving off the grid and plan how you will live without power .
9 . Stockpile quantities of gas , kerosene , diesel , water and candles .
10 . Create your plan of defense and protection for your home and area .
11 . Sharp - shoot practice with your weapons and prepare to use them .
12 . Re-locate to a more rural area near resources and a clean water source .
I intend to do everything in my power to see that our family ’s cemetery plot remains unfilled for many years .
The gravedigger is not welcome here .

Welcome to the ECCEROBOT Homepage , the home of the first anthropomimetic robot
ECCEROBOT ( Embodied Cognition in a Compliantly Engineered Robot ) is a three - year project funded by the 7th framework programme of the EU ( ICT - Challenge 2 , " Cognitive Systems , Interaction , Robotics " ) .
It has three goals : to build the first truly anthropomimetic robot ; to find out how to control it ; and finally , to investigate its human - like cognitive features .
What is different about the ECCEROBOT approach ?
Find out by watching our
Since the government and central bank are once again inflating the economy , let ’s look back at what happened the last time they did this .
The Bush - Greenspan team used war , fiscal stimulus , and FED money - pumping to produce a housing bubble that drove the unbalanced economic recovery of the early 2000s .
Personal saving dropped as sharply as debt rose , but the recovery was halting and anemic .
While the Clinton years saw the real GDP rise 35.4 percent in 8 years , the Bush years had a 21.0 percent overall rise .
The stock market recovery was likewise labored and anemic .
The broad - based Wilshire 5000 Index did not exceed its year 2000 peak of 14,991.68 until 2007 when it peaked at 15,806.69 .
The net gain was minuscule .
The inflation and debt - driven recovery drove the dollar index down from a 2001 level of 120 to its current level under 78 .
In thinking about the future , it helps to think in terms of " orders of magnitude . "
The largest hydrogen bomb released 50 million tons of energy .
An atomic bomb releases about 500,000 tons .
The hydrogen bomb is larger by a factor of 100 .
If a factor of 10 is an order of magnitude , then the difference in this case is exponential .
We are in the early stages of a resurgent government - produced inflation both in the FED ’s balance sheet and also in government debt .
In both cases , we are looking at changes that are already several orders of magnitude larger than anything we have ever experienced before .
We are going into uncharted waters .
There are going to be produced large surprises in the various markets for goods , services , labor , bonds , stocks , real estate , currency , commodities , and gold .
Barack Obama and Ben Bernanke do not want to go down in history as the leaders who presided over Great Depression II .
To avoid that fate , they are blowing up the American debt bubble to even greater dimensions than George Bush and Alan Greenspan did .
By taking over nearly the entire mortgage market , the U.S. government has vast risk exposures to interest rates and housing prices .
The effects of the Bush - Greenspan bubbles have been centered on declines in real estate prices and the resulting loans gone bad that have made hundreds and hundreds of banks insolvent and doomed to fail .
When financial stock indexes like XLF fell 82 percent , it was for good reason .
That index has recovered somewhat .
It is now down 61 percent .
It hit a low on March 6 , 2009 .
It turned up slightly in advance of the news on March 18 that the FED would inflate by over $ 1 trillion ( quantitative easing . )
In the previous episode of inflation , bank and consumer balance sheets became distorted and over - leveraged .
The end result was destruction of the capital invested in these sectors , both equity values and loan values .
This time around , the effects are going to be different .
In this case , it is the balance sheets of the central bank and federal government that are being heavily distorted and over - leveraged .
The end result will be a destruction of their capital .
This will show up in three main ways : problems with the dollar , problems with government debt , and problems with government taxes and transfer payments .
The dollar will be under continual downward pressure against gold .
The dollar index is likely to decline too as the flight to the dollar abates and other central banks shift away from dollar securities as a reserve .
As the Obama programs are enacted , U.S. government debt will continue to soar .
This debt will come under a cloud .
The default risk will rise , and this will cause the yields to rise and the prices to fall .
The inflation component will rise too , with the same effects .
The government will have problems funding its programs .
It will be under pressure to raise taxes and cut back on its programs .
Since it will be reluctant to do either , the problems will fall upon the dollar and on the government debt .
This will place the government in an untenable position because the higher interest costs of the debt will add to the deficit .
An undesirable feedback cycle will occur in which deficits cause higher interest costs which cause more deficits which cause higher interest costs , and so on .
No amount of taxation can solve the government ’s fiscal problem that lies ahead .
Greater taxes will only make them worse by slowing the economy .
That option is foreclosed .
How about spending ?
Will the government when faced with these problems control its spending ?
No , not in any orderly way .
Political maneuvering is unlikely to produce a rational process of control and a reduction in spending .
Instead , the political forces are likely to be involved in continual fighting in order to gore someone else ’s ox .
The fact of the matter is that Obama plans to increase government spending by an order of magnitude , not take it down by an order of magnitude .
The deficit is already approaching runaway status , even without this added spending .
Perhaps Obama will be a one - term president .
No matter .
Past Republicans have worsened the government ’s fiscal situation even more readily than Democrats .
Little relief can be expected in that direction .
Gridlock in Congress may seem the best bet , but it seems that logrolling overcomes gridlock
The two problems — the dollar and debt — are joined .
If the FED tries to save the dollar , it affects government debt adversely .
The FED can relieve pressure on the dollar by deflating its bloated balance sheet .
To do that it needs to sell off the mortgage - backed securities that it has accumulated and not buy the rest that it is now in the process of buying .
If it ever does sell off these securities , it will pressure the government debt market .
This is very unlikely .
Instead I expect it to pay interest on reserves , which will not solve its problems and will only add to the government deficit and start an exponential process of increase in interest paid .
If the government tries to save the debt market by having the FED support it as it is now doing , that affects the dollar adversely .
The central bank and the government are between a rock and a hard place .
One or the other or both of the dollar and the debt are slated to have problems .
Enactment of Obama ’s health care and energy measures , even in diluted form , will confirm the existing course .
Their rejection will be more favorable for the dollar and for government debt .
As the political winds shift , so will the fortunes of the dollar and the government debt markets .
Investment is now a gamble on politics .
My bet is this .
One fine day the bottom is going to drop out of the dollar .
There will be a swift and sharp order of magnitude change .
The recognition of the problems will reach a point at which it starts to go exponential , not just in terms of people being vaguely conscious that things are not right , but in terms of actually taking action to protect themselves .
Foreign central banks may be reluctant to dump their dollar securities and think it better to liquidate them slowly so as not to drive prices down and break the market , but when they observe that others are running for the exits , they will run too .
There will be a run on the FED and a run on the U.S. government .
Runs upon the dollar and U.S. government debt are where things are now headed , and that is a scenario that calls for action now .
And the more of us that act upon it now , the more likely it is that we bring that reality into existence .
The FED and the government do not want to see runs upon them .
They will soft soap everyone as long as they can because rhetoric is the cheapest form of action , but really to prevent these runs from occurring , they have to take concrete measures that suggest a fundamental shift in the fiscal and monetary courses they are now on .
If the major governments of the world could get themselves and their peoples involved in a war like World War I that killed 20 million human beings , can a government not create such economic imbalances that it derails its debt , currency , and economy ?
It has already happened many , many times in the past .
The only novelty now is that it is happening in America .

The next bubble : Priming the markets for tomorrow 's big crash

A financial bubble1 is a market aberration manufactured by government , finance , and industry , a shared speculative hallucination and then a crash , followed by depression .
Bubbles were once very rare — one every hundred years or so was enough to motivate politicians , bearing the post - bubble ire of their newly destitute citizenry , to enact legislation that would prevent subsequent occurrences .
After the dust settled from the 1720 crash of the South Sea Bubble , for instance , British Parliament passed the Bubble Act to forbid “ raising or pretending to raise a transferable stock . ”
For a century this law did much to prevent the formation of new speculative swellings .
Nowadays we barely pause between such bouts of insanity .
The dot - com crash of the early 2000s should have been followed by decades of soul - searching ; instead , even before the old bubble had fully deflated , a new mania began to take hold on the foundation of our long - standing American faith that the wide expansion of home ownership can produce social harmony and national economic well - being .
Spurred by the actions of the Federal Reserve , financed by exotic credit derivatives and debt securitiztion , an already massive real estate sales - and - marketing program expanded to include the desperate issuance of mortgages to the poor and feckless , compounding their troubles and ours .
That the Internet and housing hyperinflations transpired within a period of ten years , each creating trillions of dollars in fake wealth , is , I believe , only the beginning .
There will and must be many more such booms , for without them the economy of the United States can no longer function .
The bubble cycle has replaced the business cycle .
Such transformations do not take place overnight .
After World War I , Wall Street wrote checks to finance new companies that were trying to turn wartime inventions , such as refrigeration and radio , into consumer products .
The consumers of the rising middle class were ready to buy but lacked funds , so the banking system accommodated them with new forms of credit , notably the installment plan .
Following a brief recession in 1921 , federal policy accommodated progress by keeping interest rates below the rate of inflation .
Pundits hailed a “ new era ” of prosperity until Black Tuesday , October 29 , 1929 .
The crash , the Great Depression , and World War II were a brutal education for government , academia , corporate America , Wall Street , and the press .
For the next sixty years , that chastened generation managed to keep the fog of false hopes and bad credit at bay .
Economist John Maynard Keynes emerged as the pied piper of a new school of economics that promised continuous economic growth without end .
Keynes ’s doctrine :
When a business cycle peaks and starts its downward slide , one must increase federal spending , cut
taxes , and lower short - term interest rates to increase the money supply and expand credit .
The demand stimulated by deficit spending and cheap money will thereby prevent a recession .
In 1932 this set of economic gambits was dubbed “ reflation . ”
The first Keynesian reflation was botched .
To be fair , it was perhaps impractical under the gold standard , for by the time the Federal Reserve made its attempt to ameliorate matters , debt was already out of control .
2
Banks failed , credit contracted , and GDP shrank .
The economy was running in reverse and refused to respond to Keynesian inducements .
In 1933 , President Franklin D. Roosevelt called in gold and repriced it , hoping to test Keynes ’s theory that monetary inflation stimulates demand .
The economy began to expand .
But it was World War II that brought real recovery , as a highly effective , demand - generating , deficit - and - debt - financed public - works project for the United States .
The war did what a flawed application of Keynes ’s theories could not .
A few weeks after D - Day , the allies met at the Mount Washington Hotel in Bretton Woods , New Hampshire , to determine the future of the international monetary system .
It was n’t much of a negotiation .
Western economies were in ruins , and the international monetary system had been in disarray since the start of the Great Depression .
The United States , now the dominant economic and military power , successfully pushed to peg the currencies of member nations to the dollar and to make dollars redeemable in American gold .
Americans could now spend as wisely or foolishly as our government policy decreed and , regardless of the needs of other nations holding dollars as reserves , print as many dollars as desired .
But by the second quarter of 1971 , the U.S. balance of merchandise trade had run up a deficit of $ 3.8 billion ( adjusted for inflation ) — an admittedly tiny sum compared with the deficit of $ 204 billion in the second quarter of 2007 , but until that time the United States had run only surpluses .
Members of the Bretton Woods system , most famously French President General Charles de Gaulle , worried that the United States intended to repay the money borrowed to cover its trade gap with depreciated dollars .
Opposed to the exercise of such “ exorbitant privilege , ” de Gaulle demanded payment in gold .
With the balance of payments so greatly out of balance , newly elected President Richard Nixon faced a run on the U.S. gold supply , and his solution was novel : unilaterally end the U.S. legal obligation to redeem dollars with gold ; in other words , default .
More than a decade of economic and financial - market chaos followed , as the dollar remained the international currency but traded without an absolute measure of value .
Inflation rose not just in the United States but around the world , grinding down the worth of many securities and brokerage firms .
The Federal Reserve pushed interest rates into double digits , setting off two global recessions , and new international standards and methods for measuring inflation and floating exchange rates were established to replace the gold standard .
After 1975 , the United States would never again post an annual merchandise trade surplus .
Such high - value , finished - goods - producing industries as steel and automobiles were no longer dominant .
The new economy belonged to finance , insurance , and real estate — FIRE .
FIRE is a credit - financed , asset - price - inflation machine organized around one tenet : that the value of one ’s assets , which used to fluctuate in response to the business cycle and the financial markets , now goes in only one direction , up , with no more than occasional short - term reversals .
With FIRE leading the way , the United States , free of the international gold standard ’s limitations , now had great flexibility to finance its deficits with its own currency .
This was “ exorbitant privilege ” on steroids .
Massive external debts built up as trade partners to the United States , especially the oil - producing nations and Japan , balanced their trade surpluses with the purchase of U.S. financial assets .
3
The process of financing our deficit with private and public foreign funds became self - reinforcing , for if any of the largest holders of our debt reduced their holdings , the trade value of the dollar would fall — and with that , the value of their remaining holdings would be decreased .
Worse , if not enough U.S. financial assets were purchased , the United States would be less able to finance its imports .
It ’s the old rule about bank debt , applied to international deficit finance : if you owe the banks $ 3 billion , the bank owns you .
But if you owe the banks $ 10 trillion , you own the banks .
The FIRE sector ’s power grew unchecked as the old manufacturing economy declined .
The root of the 1920s bubble , it was believed , had been the conflicts of interest among banks and securities firms , but in the 1990s , under the leadership of Alan Greenspan at the Federal Reserve , banking and securities markets were deregulated .
In 1999 , the Glass - Steagall Act of 1933 , which regulated banks and markets , was repealed , while a servile federal interest - rate policy helped move things along .
As FIRE rose in power , so did a new generation of politicians , bankers , economists , and journalists willing to invent creative justifications for the system , as well as for the projects — ranging from the housing bubble to the Iraq war — that it financed .
The high - water mark of such truckling might be the publication of the Cato Institute report “ America ’s Record Trade Deficit : A Symbol of Strength . ”
Freedom had become slavery ; persistent deficits had become economic power .
The bubble machine often starts with a new invention or discovery .
The Mosaic graphical Web browser , released in 1993 , began to transform the Internet into a set of linked pages .
Suddenly websites were easy to create and even easier to consume .
Industry lobbyists stepped in , pushing for deregulation and special tax incentives .
By 1995 , the Internet had been thrown open to the profiteers ; four years later a sales - tax moratorium was issued , opening the floodgates for e-commerce .
Such legislation does not cause a bubble , but no bubble has ever occurred in its absence .
I had a front - row seat to the Internet - stock mania of the late 1990s as managing director of Osborn Capital , a “ seed stage ” venture - capital firm founded by Jeffrey Osborn , 4 with positions on the boards of more than half a dozen technology companies .
I observed otherwise rational men and women fall under the influence of a fast - flowing and , it was widely believed , risk - free flood of money .
Logic and historical precedent were pushed aside .
I remember a managing partner of one firm telling me with certainty that if the company in which we ’d invested failed , at least it had “ hard assets , ” meaning the notoriously depreciation - prone computer equipment the company had received in exchange for stock .
A year after the bubble collapsed , of course , the market was flooded with such hard assets .
Deregulation had built the church , and seed money was needed to grow the flock .
The mechanics of financing vary with each bubble , but what matters is that the system be able to support astronomical flows of funds and generate trillions of dollars ’ worth of new securities .
For the Internet , the seed money came from venture capital .
At first , Internet startups were merely one part of a spectrum of enterprise - software and other technology industries into which venture capitalists put their money .
Then a few startups like Netscape went public , netting massive returns .
Such liquidity events came faster and faster .
A loop was formed : profits from IPO investments poured back into new venture funds , then into new start - ups , then back out again as IPOs , with the original investment multiplied many times over , then finally back into new venture - capital funds .
The media stood by cheering , carrying breathless profiles of wunderkinder in their early twenties who had just made their first hundred million dollars ; business publications grew thick with advertisements .
The media barely questioned the fine points of the new theology .
Skeptics were occasionally interviewed by journalists , but in general the public was exposed to constant reiterations of the one true faith .
Government stood back — after all , there was little incentive for lawmakers to intervene .
Members of Congress , who influence the agencies that oversee market - regulation functions , have never been unfriendly to windfall tax revenues , and the FIRE sector has very deep pockets .
According to the donation - tracking website opensecrets.org , FIRE gave $ 146 million in political donations for the 2008 election cycle alone , and since 1990 more than $ 1.9 billion — nearly double what lawyers and lobbyists have donated , and more than triple the donations from organized labor .
Part of my job was to watch for the end - time , to maximize gains and guard the firm against sudden losses when the bubble finally popped .
In March 2000 , the signal arrived .
One of our companies was investigating the timing of an IPO ; the management team was hoping for April 2000 .
The representatives of one of the investment banks we talked to gave us a surprisingly specific recommendation that ran counter to advice offered by banks during the IPO - driven cycle of the preceding five years : they warned the company not to go public in April .
We took the advice in the context of other indicators as a clear sign of a top , and over the next few months we liquidated stocks in public companies that we held as a result of earlier IPOs .
Shortly thereafter , millions of investors with unrealized gains in mutual funds sold stock to raise enough cash to pay taxes on their capital gains .
The mass selling set off a panic , and the bubble popped .
In a bubble , fictitious value5 goes away when market participants lose faith in the religion — when their false beliefs are destroyed as quickly as they had been formed .
Since the early 1980s , the free - market orthodoxy of the Chicago School has driven policy on the upward slope of an economic boom , but we ’re all Keynesians on the way down : rate cuts by the Federal Reserve , tax cuts by Congress , deficit spending , and dollar depreciation are deployed in heroic proportions .
The technology industry represents only a small fraction of the U.S. economy , but the effects of layoffs , cutbacks , and the collapsing stock market rippled through the economy and produced a brief national recession in the early part of 2001 , despite a concerted effort by the Federal Reserve and Congress to avoid it .
This left in its wake a crucial dilemma : how to counter the loss of that $ 7 trillion in fictitious value built up during the bubble .
The Internet boom had been a matter of abstract electrons and monetized eyeballs — castles in the sky translated into rising share prices .
The new boom was in McMansions on the ground — wood and nails , granite countertops .
The price - inflation process was traditional as well : there was way too much mortgage money chasing not enough housing .
At the bubble ’s peak , $ 12 trillion in fictitious value had been created , a sum greater even than the national debt .
We certainly should have known better .
Historically , the price of American homes has risen at a rate similar to the annual rate of inflation .
As the Yale economist Robert Shiller has pointed out , since 1890 , discounting the housing boom after World War II , that rate has been about 3.3 percent .
Why , then , did housing prices suddenly begin to hyperinflate ?
Changes in the reserve requirements of U.S. banks , and the creation in 1994 of special “ sweep ” accounts , which link commercial checking and investment accounts , allowed banks greater liquidity — which meant that they could offer more credit .
This was the formative stage of the bubble .
Then , from 2001 to 2002 , in the wake of the dot - com crash , the Federal Reserve Funds Rate was reduced from 6 percent to 1.24 percent , leading to similar cuts in the London Interbank Offered Rate that banks use to set some adjustable - rate mortgage ( ARM ) rates .
These drastically lowered ARM rates meant that in the United States the monthly cost of a mortgage on a $ 500,000 home fell to roughly the monthly cost of a mortgage on a $ 250,000 home purchased two years earlier .
Demand skyrocketed , though home builders would need years to gear up their production .
With more credit available than there was housing stock , prices predictably , and rapidly , rose .
All that was needed for hypergrowth was a supply of new capital .
For the Internet boom this money had been provided by the IPO system and the venture capitalists ; for the housing bubble , starting around 2003 , it came from securitized debt .
To “ securitize ” is to make a new security out of a pool of existing bonds , bringing together similar financial instruments , like loans or mortgages , in order to create something more predictable , less risk - laden , than the sum of its parts .
Many such “ pass - thru ” securities , backed by mortgages , were set up to allow banks to serve almost purely as middlemen , so that if a few homeowners defaulted but the rest continued to pay , the bank that sold the security would itself suffer
little — or at least far less than if it held the mortgages directly .
In theory , risks that used to concentrate on a bank ’s balance sheet had been safely spread far and wide across the financial markets among well - financed and experienced institutional investors .

The U.S. mortgage crisis has been labeled a “ subprime mortgage crisis , ” but subprime mortgages were only a sideshow that appeared late , as the housing - bubble credit machine ran out of creditworthy borrowers .
The main event was the hyperinflation of home prices .
Risks are embedded in price and lurk as defaults .
Even after the faith that supported a bubble recedes , false beliefs continue to obscure cause and effect as the crisis unfolds .
Consider the chemical industry of forty years ago , back when such pollutants as PCBs were dumped into the air and water with little or no regulation .
For years , the mantra of the industry was “ the solution to pollution is dilution . ”
Mixing toxins with vast quantities of air and water was supposed to neutralize them .
Many decades later , with our plagues of hermaphrodite frogs , poisoned ground water , and mysterious cancers , the mistake in that logic is plain .
Modern bankers , however , have carried this mistake into the world of finance .
As more and more loans with a high risk of default were made from the late 1990s to the summer of 2007 , the shared level of credit risk increased throughout the global financial system .
Think of that enormous risk as ecomonic poison .
In theory , those risk pollutants have been diluted in the oceanic vastness of the world ’s debt markets ; thanks to the magic of securitization , they are made nontoxic and so pose no systemic risk .
In reality , credit pollutants pose the same kind of threat to our economy as chemical toxins do to our environment .
Like their chemical counterparts , they tend to concentrate in the weakest and most vulnerable parts of the financial system , and that ’s where the toxic effects show up first : the subprime mortgage market collapse is essentially the Love Canal of our ongoing risk - pollution disaster .
Read the front page of any business publication today and you can see the mess bubbling up .
In the United States , Merrill Lynch took a $ 7.9 billion hit from its mortgage investments and experienced its first quarterly loss since 2001 ; Morgan Stanley , Bear Stearns , Citigroup , along with many other U.S. banks , have all suffered major losses .
The Royal Bank of
Scotland Group was forced to write down $ 3 billion on credit - related securities and leveraged loans , and Japan ’s Norinchukin Bank suffered $ 357 million in subprime - related losses in the six months prior to September 2007 .
Even more of this pollution will become manifest as home prices continue to fall .
The metaphor is not lost on those touched by debt pollution .
In December 2007 , Chip Mason of Legg Mason , one of the world ’s largest money managers , said that the U.S. Treasury should put $ 20 billion into a “ structured investment vehicles superfund ” to boost investor confidence .
As more and more risk pollution rises to the surface , credit will continue to contract , and the FIRE economy — which depends on the free flow of credit — will experience its first near - death experience since the sector rose to power in the early 1980s .
Because all asset hyperinflations revert to the mean , we can expect housing prices to decline roughly 38 percent from their peak as they return to something closer to the historical rate of monetary inflation .
If the rate of decline stabilizes at between 6 and 7 percent each year , the correction has about six years to go before things stabilize , leaving the FIRE economy in need of $ 12 trillion .
Where will that money be found ?
Bubbles are to the industries that host them what clear - cutting is to forest management .
After several years of recession , the affected industry will eventually grow back , but slowly — the NASDAQ , for example , at 5,048 in March 2000 , had recovered only half of its peak value going into 2007 .
When those trillions of dollars first die and go to money heaven , the whole economy grieves .
The housing bubble has left us in dire shape , worse than after the technology - stock bubble , when the Federal Reserve Funds Rate was 6 percent , the dollar was at a multi- decade peak , the federal government was running a surplus , and tax rates were relatively high , making reflation — interest - rate cuts , dollar depreciation , increased government spending , and tax cuts — relatively painless .
Now the Funds Rate is only 4.5 percent , the dollar is at multi- decade lows , the federal budget is in deficit , and tax cuts are still in effect .
The chronic trade deficit , the sudden depreciation of our currency , and the lack of foreign buyers willing to purchase its debt will require the United States government to print new money simply to fund its own operations and pay its 22 million employees .
Our economy is in serious trouble .
Both the production - consumption sector and the FIRE sector know that a debt - deflation Armageddon is nigh , and both are praying for a timely miracle , a new bubble to keep the economy from slipping into a depression .
We have learned that the industry in any given bubble must support hundreds or thousands of separate firms financed by not billions but trillions of dollars in new securities that Wall Street will create and sell .
Like housing in the late 1990s , this sector of the economy must already be formed and growing even as the previous bubble deflates .
For those investing in that sector , legislation guaranteeing favorable tax treatment , along with other protections and advantages for investors , should already be in place or under review .
Finally , the industry must be popular , its name on the lips of government policymakers and journalists .
It should be familiar to those who watch television news or read newspapers .
There are a number of plausible candidates for the next bubble , but only a few meet all the criteria .
Health care must expand to meet the needs of the aging baby boomers , but there is as yet no enabling government legislation to make way for a health - care bubble ; the same holds true of the pharmaceutical industry , which could hyperinflate only if the Food and Drug Administration was gutted of its power .
A second technology boom — under the rubric “ Web 2.0 ” — is based on improvements to existing technology rather than any new discovery .
The capital - intensive biotechnology industry will not inflate , as it requires too much specialized intelligence .
There is one industry that fits the bill : alternative energy , the development of more energy - efficient products , along with viable alternatives to oil , including wind , solar , and geothermal power , along with the use of nuclear energy to produce sustainable oil substitutes , such as liquefied hydrogen from water .
Indeed , the next bubble is already being branded .
Wired magazine , returning to its roots in boosterism , put ethanol on the cover of its October 2007 issue , advising its readers to forget oil ; NBC had a “ Green Week ” in November 2007 , with themed shows beating away at an ecological message and Al Gore making a guest appearance on the sitcom 30 Rock .
Improbably , Gore threatens to become the poster boy for the new new new economy : he has joined the legendary venture - capital firm Kleiner Perkins Caufield & Byers , which assisted at the births of Amazon.com and Google , to oversee the “ climate change solutions group , ” thus providing a massive dose of Nobel Prize–winning credibility that will be most useful when its first alternative - energy investments are taken public before a credulous mob .
Other ventures — Lazard Capital Markets , Generation Investment Management , Nth Power , EnerTech Capital , and Battery Ventures — are funding an array of startups working on improvements to solar cells , to biofuels production , to batteries , to “ energy management ” software , and so on .
The candidates for the 2008 presidential election , notably Obama , Clinton , Romney , and McCain , now invoke “ energy security ” in their stump speeches and on their websites .
Previously , “ energy independence ” was more common , and perhaps this change in terminology is a hint that a portion of the Homeland Security budget will be allocated for alternative energy , a potential boon for startups and for FIRE .
More valuable than campaign rhetoric , however , is legislation .
The Energy Policy
Act of 2005 , a massive bill known to morning commuters for extending daylight savings time , contained provisions guaranteeing loans for alternative - energy businesses , including nuclear - power technology .
The bill authorizes $ 200 million annually for clean - coal initiatives , repeals the current 160 - acre cap on coal leases , offers subsidies for wind energy and other alternative - energy producers , and promises $ 50 million annually , over the life of the bill , for a biomass grant program .
Loan guarantees for “ innovative technologies ” such as advanced nuclear - reactor designs are also at hand ; a kindler , gentler nuclear industry appears to be imminent .
The Price - Anderson Nuclear Industries Indemnity
Act has been extended through 2025 ; the secretary of energy was ordered to implement the 2001 nuclear power “ roadmap , ” and $ 1.25 billion was set aside by the Department of Energy to develop a nuclear reactor that will generate both electricity and hydrogen .
The future of transportation may be neither solar - nor ethanol - powered but instead rely on numerous small nuclear power plants generating electricity and , for local transportation , hydrogen .
At the state and local levels , related bills have been passed or are under consideration .
Supporting this alternative - energy bubble will be a boom in infrastructure — transportation and communications systems , water , and power .
In its 2005 report card , the American Society of Civil Engineers called for $ 1.6 trillion to be spent over five years to bring the United States back up to code , giving America a grade of “ D. ” Decades of neglect have put us trillions of dollars away from an “ A . ”
After last August ’s bridge collapse in Minnesota , it took only a week for libertarian Robert Poole , director of transportation studies for the Reason Foundation , to renew the call for “ highway public - private partnerships funded by tolls , ” and for Hillary Clinton to put forth a multibillion - dollar “ Rebuild America ” plan .
Of course , alternative energy and the improvement of our infrastructure are both necessary for our national well - being ; and therein lies the danger : hyperinflations , in the long run , are always destructive .
Since the 1970s , U.S. dependence on foreign energy supplies has become a major economic and security liability , and our superannuated roadways are the nation ’s circulatory system .
Without the efficient transit of gasoline - powered trucks laden with goods across our highways there would be no Wal - Mart , no other big - box stores , no morning FedEx deliveries .
Without “ energy security ” and repairs to our “ crumbling infrastructure , ” our very competitiveness is at stake .
Luckily , Al Gore will be making principled venture capital investments on our behalf .
The next bubble must be large enough to recover the losses from the housing bubble collapse .
How bad will it be ?
Some rough calculations7 : the gross market value of all enterprises needed to develop hydroelectric power , geothermal energy , nuclear energy , wind farms , solar power , and hydrogen - powered fuel - cell technology — and the infrastructure to support it — is somewhere between $ 2 trillion and $ 4 trillion ; assuming the bubble can get started , the hyperinflated fictitious value could add another $ 12 trillion .
In a hyperinflation , infrastructure upgrades will accelerate , with plenty of opportunity for big government contractors fleeing the declining market in Iraq .
Thus , we can expect to see the creation of another $ 8 trillion in fictitious value , which gives us an estimate of $ 20 trillion in speculative wealth , money that inevitably will be employed to increase share prices rather than to deliver “ energy security . ”
When the bubble finally bursts , we will be left to mop up after yet another devastated industry .
FIRE , meanwhile , will already be engineering its next opportunity .
Given the current state of our economy , the only thing worse than a new bubble would be its absence .

Megan Wants a Millionaire

As it is now , every girl on My Antonio gets a covered dinner plate , and you get to stay on the show if there are flowers inside yours .
It 's either insane , or maybe he 's testing them to see if they 're stupid enough to eat flowers .
All I 'm saying is that if I was a teenage girl trying to date the guy my mom watched onMelrose Place , maybe a card with some money in it would be a more appropriate gift .
Megan is another girl from Rock of Love who got her own show , only on this one , wealthy douchebags battle for the opportunity to buy her .
Try to imagine how bad a millionaire has to be with women that he has to go on TV and humiliate himself for the CHANCE at paying for sex with a six .
That 's how awkward these guys are around girls .
They could n't get laid if their wangs cured yeast infections .
I 've seen Christopher Walken play games of Russian Roulette that were less nerve - wracking than watching these creepy assholes talk to a girl .
And once again , while you would n't hide her from your friends , Megan is n't exactly disarming .
There 's no reason to be so nervous unless they 're all Poison memorabilia collectors desperate to add Bret Michaels 's herpes to their collections .
There 's only one way to end this show - - line all the contestants up , give them a cigarette , and invoice each of their families for the cost of a .30 - 30 cartridge .
Bidding on a white girl is n't a TV show concept -- that 's a situation that Mad Max would come across just to remind him how fucked up the post - apocalypse is .
One contestant built his fortune stripping ; another was n't even rich -- he was just trying to buy Megan with the money he 'll probably have when his dumb , stupid grandpa finally dies .
This entire show is so amoral that it had to be pulled off the airafter one of the contestants murdered and dismembered a woman who later had to be identified by her breast implants .
And what 's crazier than that is that given a choice , he would n't even be the first one you execute .
Megan Wants a Millionaire is a Greatest Hits of man 's inhumanity to man .
They probably burned down an Indian reservation to build the set , and during a few scenes you can see the altar of panda bones where Megan has congress with the Beast .
I just hope the millionaire that won her knows that her resale value is worse than a Dodge Durango .
And that sex with her is like fighting a bag full of poisonous snakes .
Seriously , of all the women in the world , why buy the one that lights on fire when medicine touches her skin ?
I noted in a diary in late July that Christine A. Varney , the Justice Department 's antitrust chief , made an important signal in how she was going to determine the scope and purpose of antitrust action :
In my view , we cannot develop sound antitrust policy merely on a case - by - case basis .
Instead , as I have charged the Division 's staff , we must consider the overall state of competition in the industries in which we are reviewing potentially anticompetitive conduct or mergers , or providing guidance to regulatory agencies charged with industry oversight .
We thus must consider market trends and dynamics , and not lose sight of the broader impacts of antitrust enforcement .
In my opinion , she signaled a departure from the dominant philosophy that has governed competition law in the United States since the Reagan Administration .
To simplify , there are basically two schools of thought :
Traditional trust - busting :
You 've got too much market concentration .
Judge Robert Bork 's consumer oriented philosophy : Market concentration is okay , as long as prices are cheap .
As I wrote in this diary , the two different approaches lead to starkly different sorts of antitrust cases that are brought against industries .
Professor Zephyr Teachout of Duke argues that we turn away from the Bork philosophy ( which leads to " too big to fail , " imo ) :
We now have an economy that we do n't understand and can't seem to control even when we want to .
Having created corporations , we have let some of them become " too big to fail " - - a dangerous state of affairs , both economically and politically .
Perhaps there are some companies that are simply too big to exist .
One way to avoid a similar problem in the future could be an antitrust law that limits how big corporations can become .
This is not a new idea ; at the time the modern antitrust statutes took shape in our country about a century ago , political leaders were concerned directly with corporate size and power .
In the last several decades , however , legal economists have sharply narrowed antitrust law , leaning heavily on the assumption that larger companies can be more efficient .
This view has some merit ; after all , efficient companies can produce cheaper consumer products , and everyone shares in the savings .
But the recent crisis should make us consider whether these economists have been leading us astray .
...
There are also reasons to think an antitrust policy focused on size and power makes good economic sense .
Despite economic theorizing , bigger companies are not always more efficient companies .
And even if they were , there are important societal efficiencies that go beyond whether individual companies operate cheaply or produce low - cost products .
As Bert Foer of the American Antitrust Institute recently testified before Congress , we can choose to use competition policy to help prevent much of the systemic risk that has crippled our economy .
By focusing more on size and concentration , we might be able to avoid collapse , unplanned nationalization , and bailouts .
Professor Teachout makes a point I agree with entirely .
While it may be great that we get cheap stuff from Wal - Mart because of its illusory efficiencies , it can not be a good thing for capitalism when any one company becomes so large that it crowds out challengers and endangers the economic system as a whole .
We have to turn away from the Judge Bork ( yes . . THAT Judge Bork ) philosophy and return to basic Teddy Roosevelt trustbusting .
Simply put , we have to make it a bad thing to be too big .
Over the past few decades , in part under the increasing influence of free - market economic theory , antitrust enforcement by the Department of Justice has become more tolerant of size and concentration in themselves , and has focused instead on whether mergers will benefit or harm consumers .
On the one hand , increased concentration increases the ability of large firms to raise prices , hurting consumers ; on the other hand , or so the argument goes , larger firms gain economies of scale that enable them to reduce costs and therefore reduce prices to consumers .
( If you believe that , take a look at the price of text messaging on your mobile phone bill . )
Economics Blogger James Kwok
The Bush Administration adopted the antitrust philosophy that even Judge Bork 's antitrust philosophy was out of bonds .
They had one policy : no enforcement whatsoever .
I had thought the incoming Obama Administration would revert back to the Borkian phiolosophy that was the default during the Clinton Administration , but the above mentioned announcement is now causing me to believe their intentions are much more expansive .
By adopting the Herfindahl - Hirschman Index the Antitrust Division would signal that it will go back ( almost ) to the basics of Antitrust , discarding the Bork philosophy for the first time in almost 30 years .
If the department intends to analyze markets according to this measure , and not simply if " consumers have a choice " , it is going to cause a lot of groaning in merger - minded corporate America .
Here is a quick example of how the HHI works :
For instance , two cases in which the six largest firms produce 90 % of the output : * Case 1 : All six firms produce 15 % each , and
* Case 2 : One firm produces 80 % while the five others produce 2 % each .
We will assume that the remaining 10 % of output is divided among 10 equally sized producers .
The six - firm concentration ratio would equal 90 % for both case 1 and case 2 , but in the first case competition would be fierce where the second case approaches monopoly .
The Herfindahl index for these two situations makes the lack of competition in the second case strikingly clear : * Case 1 : Herfindahl index = 6 * 15%2 + 10 * 1%2 = 13.6 %
* Case 2 : Herfindahl index = 80%2 + 5 * 2%2 + 10 * 1%2 = 64.3 %
This behavior rests in the fact that the market shares are squared prior to being summed , giving additional weight to firms with larger size .
The index involves taking the market share of the respective market competitors , squaring it , and adding them together ( e.g. in the market for X , company A has 30 % , B , C , D , E and F have 10 % each and G through to Z have 1 % each ) .
If the resulting figure is above a certain threshold then economists consider the market to have a high concentration ( e.g. market X's concentration is " 0.142 " or " 14.2 % " ) .
This threshold is considered to be " 0.18 " in the US , [ 4 ] while the EU prefers to focus on the level of change , for instance that concern is raised if there 's a " 0.025 " change when the index already shows a concentration of " 0.1 " .
[ 5 ]
So to take the example , if in market X company B ( with 10 % market share ) suddenly bought out the shares of company C ( with 10 % also ) then this new market concentration would make the index jump to " 0.172 " .
Here it can be seen that it would not be relevant for merger law in the U.S. ( being under 0.18 ) but would in the EU ( because there 's a change of over 0.025 ) .
Put simply , now two firms control half the market , so serious competition questions are raised .
This would be a very significant decision in Antitrust law .
I 'm quite sure a lot of industries in this country if placed under this analysis would come out extremely concentrated .
Even by adopting the European delta standard , we 'd still have a great deal of excess concentration across many , many markets , especially if considered on a regional rather than national basis .
Some of you may be thinking " The Health Insurance Industry ! "
Well , no .
As I have written here often , the Insurance industry is exempt from antitrust action because of the God awful McCarran - Ferguson Act .

Washington , D.C. , August 16 , 2009 - In December 1971 , President Richard Nixon and Brazilian President Emilio Garrastazú Médici discussed Brazil ’s role in efforts to overthrow the elected government of Salvador Allende in Chile , formerly Top Secret records posted by the National Security Archive today reveal .
According to a declassified memorandum of conversation , Nixon asked Médici whether the Chilean military was capable of overthrowing Allende .
“ He felt that they were … , ” Médici replied , “ and made clear that Brazil was working toward this end . ”
The Top Secret “ memcon ” of the December 9 , 1971 , Oval Office meeting indicates that Nixon offered his approval and support for Brazil ’s intervention in Chile .
“ The President said that it was very important that Brazil and the United States work closely in this field .
We could not take direction but if the Brazilians felt that there was something we could do to be helpful in this area , he would like President Médici to let him know .
If money were required or other discreet aid , we might be able to make it available .
This should be held in the greatest confidence . ”
The U.S. and Brazil , Nixon told Médici , “ must try and prevent new Allendes and Castros and try where possible to reverse these trends . ”
During the same meeting , President Médici asked Nixon if “ we ” should be supporting Cuban exiles who “ had forces and could overthrow Castro ’s regime . ”
Nixon responded that “ we should , as long as we did not push them into doing something that we could not support , and as long as our hand did not appear . ”
The two also participated in a discussion of the potential to undermine the populist Peruvian President General Velasco Alvarado by publicizing the allegation that he had a lovechild with a mistress — she was a former “ Miss Peru ” — in Paris , according to General Vernon Walters who also attended the Médici / Nixon meeting .
The documents were declassified in July as part of the State Department ’s Foreign Relations of the United States ( FRUS ) series .
The memcon records Nixon telling Médici that he “ hoped we could cooperate closely , as there were many things that Brazil as a South American country could do that the U.S. could not . ”
Indeed , the documentation reveals that Nixon believed that a special relationship with Brazil was so important that he proposed a secret back - channel between the two presidents “ as a means of communicating directly outside of normal diplomatic channels . ”
Médici named his private advisor and foreign minister Gibson Barbosa as his backchannel representative , but told Nixon that for “ extremely private and delicate matters ” Brazil would use Col. Manso Netto .
Nixon named Kissinger as his representative for the special back channel .
Communications between Nixon and Medici using the special back - channel remain secret .
Peter Kornbluh , who directs the National Security Archive ’s Chile and Brazil projects , noted that " a hidden chapter of collaborative intervention to overthrow the government of Chile " was now emmerging from the declassified documentation .
" Brazil 's archives are the missing link , " he said , calling on President Ignacio Lula da Silva to open Brazil ’s military archives on the past .
“ The full history of intervention in South America in the 1970s cannot be told without access to Brazilian documents . "
Drawing on Brazilian sources , a CIA intelligence memorandum noted that Médici had proposed that Brazil and the U.S. cooperate in countering the “ trend of Marxist / leftist expansion ” in Latin America and that Nixon promised to “ assist Brazil when and wherever possible . ”
The report noted that the substance of the secret talks had created concern among some officers in Brazil who believed that responsibility for these operations would fall to the Brazilian Armed forces .
The memo quoted General Vicente Dale Coutinho as stating that “ the United States obviously wants Brazil to ‘ do the dirty work ’ ” in South America .
A CIA National Intelligence Estimate done in 1972 predicted that Brazil would play an increasingly bigger role in hemispheric affairs , “ seeking to fill whatever vacuum the US leaves behind .
It is unlikely that Brazil will intervene openly in its neighbors internal affairs , ” the intelligence assessment predicted , “ but the regime will not be above using the threat of intervention or tools of diplomacy and covert action to oppose leftist regimes , or keep friendly governments in office , or to help place them there in countries such as Bolivia and Uruguay . ”
In 2002 , National Security Archive analyst Carlos Osorio posted a declassified Top Secret memorandum of conversation of Nixon ’s meeting with British Prime Minister Edward Heath dated December 20 , 1971 , during which the two discussed Brazil ’s role in South America .
“ Our position is supported by Brazil , which is after all the key to the future , ” states Nixon , “ The Brazilians helped rig the Uruguayan election ...
There are forces at work which we are not discouraging . "
Read the Documents
Document 1 : White House Memorandum , Top Secret , “ Meeting with President Emílio Garratazú Médici of Brazil on Thursday , December 9 , 1971 , at 10:00 a.m. , in the President ’s Office , the White House ” , December 9 , 1971 .
During this meeting between President Nixon and President Médici , the two discuss the political and economic situations in several nations of mutual concern , among them Chile , Cuba , Peru , and Bolivia .
Nixon asks Médici whether he feels the Chilean military could overthrow President Salvador Allende .
Médici responds that he believes Allende will be overthrown “ for very much the same reasons that Goulart had been overthrown in Brazil , ” and “ made it clear that Brazil was working towards this end . ”
Nixon stressed “ that it was very important that Brazil and the United States work closely in this field ” and offered “ discreet aid ” and money for Brazilian operations against the Allende government .
The two also discuss mutual operations against Castro supporting exile groups that had the forces to overthrow him , and how to block Peru ’s efforts to bring Cuba back into the OAS .
During the meeting , Nixon raises an issue he clearly considers of major importance : establishing a highly secret back channel between the two presidents : because of the close relationship they have developed , he would like to have “ a means of communicating directly outside of normal diplomatic channels when this might be necessary . ”
Médici agrees and names Brazilian Foreign Minister Gibson Barbosa as a representative for such communication while Nixon picks Kissinger .
Médici also tells
Nixon he will use Brazilian Colonel Manso Netto if the issue is particularly sensitive and discreet .
Nixon notes that the two countries “ must try and prevent new Allendes and Castros and try where possible to reverse these trends . ”
At the end of the meeting , Nixon states that he “ hoped that we could cooperate closely , as there were many things that Brazil as a South American country could do that the U.S. could not . ”
Document 2 : Memorandum from the Senior Department of Defense Attache in France ( Gen. Walters ) to the President ’s Assistant for National Security Affairs ( Henry Kissinger ) , undated .
In a memo to National Security Advisory Henry Kissinger , General Vernon Walters reports on the meeting between Médici and Nixon , and on the follow - up instructions that Nixon has given .
First , Nixon wants Kissinger and Secretary Connolly to ensure priority support for the Inter - American Development Bank .
Nixon also wants Kissinger to know that Nixon ’s special channel to Médici and the Brazilians will be through Foreign Minister Gibson Barbosa , that Col. Arthur S. Moura who presently was the Army and Defense Attache in Brazil should be promoted to Brigadier General .
The President also expects Médici to tell Kissinger of the visit of Argentine president Lanusse to Brazil and then Kissinger will relay the information to Nixon .
Gen .
Walters is also instructed to convey to Kissinger how much Nixon enjoyed meeting Médici and establishing a close relationship with the Brazilian president .
Document 3 : CIA Memorandum , from CIA Deputy Director Robert Cushman to National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger , “ Alleged Commitments Made by President Richard Nixon to Brazilian President Emílio Garrastazú Médici ” , December 29 , 1971 .
After word of the discussion between Nixon and Médici leaks to the Brazilian military , the CIA transmits intelligence on the reaction among several officers .
A memo from CIA Deputy Director Robert Cushman to National Security Advisor Henry Kissinger , asserts that the talks between Brazilian President Medici and President Nixon resulted in the two countries forming a pact to combat Latin American communism .
Cushman also reports that General Vicente Dale Coutinho , commander of the fourth army , and other field grade officers in the Northeast , “ have learned from a “ Cabinet leak ” that secret talks between the two Presidents were of great importance in the formulation of Brazilian foreign policy . ”
According to CIA intelligence , the military officers believe that the focus of the talks centered on hemisphere security , and Nixon reportedly asked support from Medici “ in safeguarding the internal security and status quo in the hemisphere , including the governments of Bolivia and Uruguay . ”
Medici agreed to the request and “ personally believes the Brazilian government must assume a greater role in defending neighboring , friendly governments . ”
According to the report , General Coutinho takes offense to this notion and feels that the U.S. wants Brazil “ to do the dirty work ” and he believes the Brazilian military will be significantly disadvantaged because of it .
Document 4 : National Intelligence Estimate 93-73 , Secret , “ The New Course in Brazil ” , January 13 , 1972 .
This National Intelligence Estimate on Brazil predicts that the Brazilian military intends to “ dominate Brazilian politics for years to come . ”
The assessment of the intelligence community is that there is no opposition capable of overthrowing the government , but if political division grows within the ranks of the military it could throw the country into chaos .
The NIE says Brazil ’s economy has a positive outlook for the next five years , and although the government will have recurring problems with the balance of payments over that time , it will “ probably be able to deal with them . ”
The NIE reports that the reputation of the Brazilian military will reflect on the strength of its economy , and the growing social problems within in the country will grow even if the economy does .
The NIE says that more Brazilians are becoming educated and realizing what their country lacks , which could affect the control of the military government .
The report reasons that Brazil will continue to see itself as an ally of the U.S. , but further nationalistic opinion within the country and trade issues will make the relationship rockier .
The NIE concludes stating that Brazil will not hesitate to intervene in its neighbors ’ affairs , using covert action “ to oppose leftist regimes , to keep friendly governments in office , or help place them there in countries such as Bolivia and Uruguay . ”
Late yesterday Freddie Mac surprised markets by reporting a profit and by not requesting additional bailout money from Treasury .
Before we celebrate , however , let ’s consider a few revealing footnotes from the company ’s quarterly filing .
But first , some key financial ratios .
As you can see , non-performing assets are still rising quickly .
( Click table to enlarge in new window )
As for the filing footnotes , we see that Freddie ’s profit line got a big assist from FASB ’s new fair value accounting rules :
Q2 :
… the company recognized $ 10.5 billion in total other - than - temporary impairments of AFS securities .
Included in this amount were $ 2.2 billion of credit - related impairments recognized in earnings ….
Also included in total other - than - temporary impairments were $ 8.3 billion of non-credit related impairments that were recognized in accumulated other comprehensive income ( loss ) ( AOCI ) .
Q1 :
During the first quarter of 2009 , prior to its … adoption of the new accounting standard , the company recorded $ 7.1 billion of security impairments on its AFS securities in earnings , reflecting both credit - related and non-credit - related impairments .
Overall , accounting changes increased equity $ 5.1 billion according to Freddie ..
Higher equity equals higher net worth .
As long as the company maintains positive net worth , Treasury does n’t have to provide more bailout funds .
Freddie ’s total bailout to date , by the way , is $ 51.7 billion .
What FASB giveth , it can also taketh .
Revisions to other accounting rules will require
Fred to bring off balance sheet assets back onto the balance sheet :
Upon the adoption of SFAS 166 and SFAS 167 [ on 1/1/10 ] , we will be required to consolidate [ off balance sheet assets ] in our financial statements , which could have a significant impact on our net worth .
Such consolidation could also significantly increase our required level of capital under existing capital rules …
I doubt the significant impact is going to be positive .
And remember , whenever Freddie ’s net worth goes negative , that triggers another bailout payment from Treasury .
As for any talk that Fan and Fred will be wound down over time , that ’s certainly not in the near future .
You can see in the table above that the company ’s portfolio of mortgages is not shrinking .*
—-
* Including non-Freddie securities , the total mortgage portfolio would have shrunk 0.3 % Q2 vs. Q1 .
BAKU ( Reuters ) -
An Azeri man said Tuesday he had been asked by the authorities to explain why he voted for the entry of arch-rival Armenia in this year ’s Eurovision Song Contest .
Inga & Anush of Armenia perform during the first semi-final rehearsals for the Eurovision Song Contest in Moscow May 12 , 2009 .
REUTERS / Sergei Karpukhin
Forty - three Azeris voted for the song “ Jan Jan ” by Armenian duo Inga and Anush in the May contest , despite lingering animosity between Muslim Azeris and Christian Armenians stemming from a war over the mountainous region of Nagorno - Karabakh in the early 1990s .
A representative of Azerbaijan ’s National Security Ministry confirmed voters were questioned , but declined further comment .
Rovshan Nasirli , a resident of the Azeri capital Baku , told Reuters he was asked about his vote by authorities in the tightly - run Caucasus state last week .
“ The National Security Ministry summoned me and started asking why I voted for the Armenian group , saying it ’s surely unpatriotic , ” he said .
“ The investigator said such behavior showed I ’m easily recruited .
I explained that I simply voted for ‘ Jan Jan ’ because I liked the style , not for political reasons . ”
Azerbaijan and Armenia remain intensely suspicious of each other 15 years after a ceasefire ended full hostilities between Azerbaijan and Armenian - backed separatists in Nagorno - Karabakh .
The region threw off Baku ’s rule with the collapse of the Soviet Union but a full peace deal has proved elusive .
Azeri and ethnic Armenian forces frequently exchange fire over a tense front line .
Rich in oil and gas , Azerbaijan is tightly controlled by President Ilham Aliyev and is frequently criticized by human rights groups for stifling free speech and democracy .
“ Jan Jan ” finished 10th in the 2009 Eurovision contest in Moscow , seven places behind Azerbaijan ’s entry “ Always ” by Aysel and Arash .
The winner was Norway ’s “ Fairytale ” sung by Alexander Rybak .
( I ’m not writing this essay as a response , but I want to note that its timing and trajectory have been influenced by the release of a Cato Institute analysis called , “ Thinking Clearly About Economic Inequality , ” and also by an interesting reaction to that analysis at The American Scene Blog . )
Dreams of GINI
We have been cheated .
If we examine the sum total of American wealth , we find that just 5 % of the population owns 68 % of the wealth .
The poorest 80 % own a piddling 9 % of the wealth .
Economic equality has deteriorated for 29 years – a trend that begins with President Reagan , but which continues through the Clinton years before peaking during Bush II ’s second term .
Like any cheater caught in the act , the top 5 % insist that it ’s fair .
They say that , in America , we have equal access to wealth .
They reference the Rags - To - Riches model , which says that even a poor black female can achieve economic success .
Everyone , therefore , is responsible for his or her own destiny .
Everyone can reach the top .
These inequality numbers prove , however , that such wonderfully - American dreams only come true for a fraction .
The masses have crowded at the door , pushing and shoving .
But only a handful will burst through .
Moral Implications
As an outcome , inequality is n’t automatically immoral .
If we play a game , and you win , that can be fair .
But if the game has been rigged – if the referees have been bought – then the outcome cannot be considered just .
So it is in America .
We expect our refereeing institutions , those that have final authority , to treat all citizens equally .
That is the democratic function , for instance , of our educational system , our government and our Media .
But higher education , undergraduate and up , requires significant attendance costs and often favors “ legacy ” applicants .
While there is widespread access to financial aid , much of it is comes in the form of loans .
The average undergraduate borrower accumulates $ 20,000 in debt .
Government also has barriers .
A candidate ca n’t even dream of competing if he does n’t have private wealth or the support of big donors .
Even then , if he campaigns outside of the two - party structure , he is basically unviable .
Similarly , Media – especially traditional media like television and print – restrict participation because of ownership costs .
They also favor elite interests because of their business model .
Unequal treatment persists in these crucial institutions of power , and so we must conclude that the resulting inequality is unfair .
Liberty vs. Equality
Let ’s imagine that each citizen of the United States was treated equally by the refereeing institutions .
If , despite that equalized opportunity , the same distribution occurred , it still would n’t necessarily be fair – though it ’s obviously more so .
If this is a basketball game , and if the opportunities are equal , then we must examine the consequences of winning and losing .
Surely you would n’t agree to a basketball game if the rules called for the loser to be beaten .
Similarly , we should n’t agree to an economic policy in which the costs of losing ( “ externalities ” ) include starvation , homelessness and a lower life expectancy .
As a society , we have the resources to guarantee food , shelter and health care .
These protections should be classified as Rights – a codification which would benefit any American who finds himself suddenly losing the game .
If we remember that wealth has declining marginal utility as it increases , we will not bemoan progressive taxation .
Conclusion
Our political system should allow for the maximum realization of individual human potential .
Our creativity should be cultivated – along with our differences .
As such , we should reject any system that would impose perfectly equal outcomes .
After all , we are inherently varied .
But human liberty cannot flourish – except for a privileged few – without equal opportunity first .
Enormous wealth gained in a rigged system is not an example of freedom .
It ’s an example of cheating .
If economic policy is indeed a matter of public policy , then we should n’t tolerate a system of life - threatening inequality .

Part 2 of “ Americans Getting Skewed ” will explore causes and solutions to the inequality problem .
It will be published Thursday .
AMARGOSA VALLEY , Nev. 
In a rural corner of Nevada reeling from the recession , a bit of salvation seemed to arrive last year .
A German developer , Solar Millennium , announced plans to build two large solar farms here that would harness the sun to generate electricity , creating hundreds of jobs .
But then things got messy .
The company revealed that its preferred method of cooling the power plants would consume 1.3 billion gallons of water a year , about 20 percent of this desert valley ’s available water .
Now Solar Millennium finds itself in the midst of a new - age version of a Western water war .
The public is divided , pitting some people who hope to make money selling water rights to the company against others concerned about the project ’s impact on the community and the environment .

A special on 9/11 has just been shown on the National Geographic Channel , produced by Robert Erickson .
Robert also conducted interviews with me and others .
In March 2009 , Prof. David Ray Griffin and I and Gregg Roberts exchanged emails with Robert Erickson which demonstrate our efforts to get Mr. Erickson and his team to be accurate and fair in their treatment of our scientific work regarding 9/11 – particularly the evidence for the use of explosives in the World Trade Center destruction .
For the record , then , I have pulled together our exchanges of emails .
Robert Erickson , emailed David Ray Griffin on 3/27/09 :
" if Jones is surprised that we just placed bags of thermite around the column ... what else would Jones have suggested ? "
I was informed of the question above and I responded on 3/28/09 as follows :
Robert ,
Bags of commercial thermite set against a steel column -- what a pathetic " experiment . "
Not anywhere close to representing my views , as you must know , from our discussion about the red / gray chips and the crucial distinction between ordinary thermite and super - thermite !
What a terrible and unfair straw - man joke you are evidently trying to pull .
Why can't you get a sample of super - thermite ?
I think you can , if you will actually try .
Or are you like NIST which refuses to look ?

I urge you to contact Mr. Erickson at LANL and request at least three " prototype " samples of super - thermite matches .
Since his interest is in " commercializing " , I would recommend telling him that you are doing a special which addresses super - thermite and that this will give his product " free advertising " , or something like that ...
I emailed him several months ago , but I lacked an approach that would help with his " commercializing " the product , which was his interest .
I think you could succeed if you tried .
Next , if you succeed in getting a few of the " super - thermite matches , " I propose to send you the complete paper that we have -- which includes a discussion of these matches along with their potential usage on 9/11 .
I think that super - thermite " matches " of this type could very well have been used to trigger more conventional explosives such as C4 in the WTC buildings .
Next step would be experiments , well - founded and relevant experiments , such as :
1 . Ask two independent laboratories to do SEM / EDS and DSC analyses as described in our paper on the super - thermite material contained in these matches .
The results would then be compared carefully with those already obtained on red chips found in the WTC dust .
One of these labs could be BYU / Dr. Farrer if you wish , since he has analyzed the red chips found in the WTC dust and could act very quickly .
( BYU requires that he be paid for any 9/11 research now . )
Such analyses are worthy of scientific publication in a peer - reviewed journal ( unlike placing bags of commercial thermite next to steel columns ) .
2 . A real demonstration would involve a C4 shaped charge applied to a steel column , with the cutter charge ignited by a highly - reliable super - thermite match ( in turn triggered using a remote radio signal ) .
These experiments would test my hypothesis .
Best wishes ,
Steven Jones
Note that this is just a few days BEFORE the appearance of our Active Thermitic Material paper , but I had given Mr. Erickson much information from the forthcoming paper .
Next a reply from Mr. Erickson on 3/30/09 :
… Dr. Jones , I respect your work and would love to pursue the experiment you outlined ...
But alas – no product .
No nano - thermite .
My budget does not provide funds for me to travel to Livermore labs .
I just have a small television production to deal with .
My attempt was never intended as a “ strawman joke ” that I ’m trying to pull on anyone .
I do n’t even see where or how to put this measly commercial grade Thermite into the “ shape charge ” device suggested by Richard Gage .
Other than a picture – where do I find a thermite shape charge ?
And since its not done with nano - thermite that experiment would suffer from the same pathetic criticism .
I ’m sorry that Richard and David did n’t tell you that the program they watched included a demonstration of a C - 4 shape charge .
These were readily available and the effect was amazing .
I asked demolition experts about setting off charges with radio signals .
They said it was very feasible .
Everyone seems to agree to the viability of radio signals setting off explosives .
That would eliminate some of the primer cord .
But the problem is very complex .
You did n’t find any C - 4 residuals in the dust ( at least that I ’ve heard you or anyone talk about ) so why are talking about C - 4 ?
And certainly whatever radio device used to trigger whatever the explosion – those radio items would have been found in abundance .
Before shipping anything off to China the WTC materials were combed for personal affects etc .
No curious radio transmitters were found .
It seems to come back to the CALL for a new investigation .
With enough $ $ to pursue the experiment you suggest .
My company does n’t have the money .
And apparently – even if I ’m willing to look ...
No nano - thermite is available .
If we can just get scientists to look at the case ...
That are willing to address the nano - thermite that are n’t the nano - thermite experts at NIST .
Those guys are unwilling to look and yet ironically know all about nano - thermite .

[ I thought that was very interesting from the producer of the National Geographic documentary , and I replied : ]
Robert ,
… One should not be surprised at the difficulty in getting the [ nanothermite ] material , but there are photos , including photos of ignition of the material .
Both LANL and LLNL have made the material -- I will try to send the Nanotech journal article proving this shortly …

This is what I meant when I told Robert above , “ A real demonstration would involve a C4 shaped charge applied to a steel column , with the cutter charge ignited by a highly - reliable super - thermite match ” — Steven Jones ]
.. As you can see from the NanoTech magazine , super - thermite / nano - thermite has been available for years [ before 9/11/2001 ] .
You may wish to contact Tillotson at LANL -- he has answered some of our questions and may be cooperative .
Perhaps he could even give you a small sample .
About C4 , we have not yet looked for residues and indeed these will be difficult to find UNLESS there was a taggant , which is unlikely ( if my hypothesis of out - sourced production of C4 and probably super - thermite matches is correct ... )

[ On the same day , 3/30/09 , Gregg Roberts of AE911 Truth.org wrote the following to the NGC producer .
Earlier , Robert Erickson had written :
“ Before shipping anything off to China the WTC materials were combed for personal affects etc .
No curious radio transmitters were found . ” ]
Robert ,
It is not transmitters that would have been placed throughout the buildings to set off the charges , but rather receivers .
Those could have been made exceedingly small , as well as disguised .
Again , rather than putting all this burden on us to answer detailed speculative questions , a fair approach will focus on the more than 100 blatant contradictions and gaps in the official story , which are extremely well documented by Griffin 's books , essays by Kevin Ryan , Dylan Avery 's film , and so on .
Why should we as citizens put up with having such contradictions and gaps in the very foundation of the War on Terror , the expenditure of more than a trillion in defense spending , and the trampling of the Constitution ?
Even if all we skeptics had ever done was point to those problems , without suggesting an alternate explanation , it SHOULD mean that the US government has a lot of explaining to do .
Instead , for some reason we are constantly being asked to speculate about things that other people KNOW the answers to .
Producing a video with any sort of " History 's Mysteries " or " conspiracy debunking " feel to it , as I am starting to get the impression this one will have , will be a grave disservice to the facts of the matter .
Ideally it would have more of a 60 Minutes feel to it , and it's the planners ( executive branch ) and funders ( Congress ) of the War on Terror who ultimately should be under the hot , bright light , being asked to explain how this and how that -- not us .
They 're the ones with the resources and responsibility to perform a full - bore , fully funded investigation with subpoena power and [ presumably ] no conflicts of interest .
They 're the ones who have failed on four out of four occasions to do perform any such investigation .
Instead they have spent thousands of times the money such an investigation would have required , invading and occupying two resource - rich nations , and bullying and buying their way into others .
Hmm , what 's an objective person to make of that ?
How much time would an objective , balanced documentary spend questioning us , as opposed to questioning them ?
-- Gregg
[ And here is Prof. Griffin ’s 3/30/09 response to Robert Erickson ’s note that he had no budget to pursue getting a sample of nanothermite . ]
Robert ,
Imagine that you did not know that it was possible for someone such as Babe Ruth or Barry Bonds to hit a baseball out of a ballpark .
You are told by some baseball fans ( or " fanatics , " as you call them ) that this is indeed possible .
So you decide to test it .
But you do n't have a baseball or a baseball bat , only a wiffle ball and a wiffle bat .
And the Babe is dead and you can't get Barry to come over , so you try it yourself .
With camera running , you apologize to the audience for the fact that you do n't have quite the right equipment , and that you 're not quite as muscular as Barry ( you have n't been taking your steroids ) , but you explain that you must do the best you can with what you 've got .
With camera rolling , you show your audience , after repeated attempts to knock the wiffle ball out of the park with the wiffle bat , that the idea that anyone could hit a baseball out of the park is absurd .
The fanatics are discredited .

[ And my final note to the producer Robert Erickson , on 3/30/09 – I find no replies from Mr. Erickson to these last emails from Gregg , Prof. Griffin or me . ]
Good point that just simple radio receivers would be needed , Gregg , and a very helpful analogy , David .
I hope the point is not missed that the debunkers such as Prof .
Eagar at MIT must now explain the presence of ton-quantities of super - thermite ( not ordinary thermite or paint ) in the WTC dust .
It will not be satisfactory to obfuscate this discovery and its independent verification simply by asking " exactly how was this used in the destruction " ?
The question is , " What are ton-quantities of high - tech super - thermite doing in the WTC dust ? "

Confidential confessions of a convenience store cashier
Ayako , an attractive 25 year old , works behind the counter in a convenience store in Tokyo ’s old shitamachi area .
The shop is owned by her family , and Ayako , a college graduate with a good job , pitches in to help out when she ’s not working at her company , reports Nikkan Gendai ( Aug. 18 ) .
“ Do some male customers march up to the cash register with an armload of smutty magazines while she ’s on the job ? ”
“ Yes , they do , ” she replies , making an expression of distaste .
“ But even worse than that are the flashers who come in . ”
Ayako recalls a man in his 30s who came into the shop wearing a coat .
There was something in his manner that put her on her guard .
He picked up a drink and a magazine and carried them to the counter .
“ I had this feeling that something funny would happen , ” she says , wrinkling her nose .
After paying for the goodies , he undid the buttons on his coat and pulled it apart , exposing the lower part of his torso .
Rather than shout for help , Ayako swiftly placed a call to the nearby koban , where , it seems , she had been dating the burly young omawarisan , who came running tout de suite and caught the guy as he was fleeing the store .
“ Rather than make the creep happy by getting all excited and screaming , you have to keep cool , ” she says .
Women working the late shift are by no means the only ones who have to worry about perverts .
Ayako said her younger brother , a budding hunk , got his butt groped by a dirty old man .
“ Nido to kuruna ” ( do n’t come back here again ) , he warned the customer through clenched teeth .
Once , says Ayako , a young male customer even brought a pair of handcuffs and asked her to put them on .
“ I looked at him and thought , ‘ Jeez , what a weirdo , ' ” she recalls , giggling .
The shop has looked into some means of preventing the doors from opening to keep such freaks at bay , but unfortunately such devices are impractical .
So as the stream of late - night flakes keep on coming , Ayako does her best to maintain a cool composure .

A Tempe mother has been arrested for allegedly pepper spraying her daughters , authorities said Monday .
The incident began when Michelle Dawn Antone , 35 , woke up around 4 p.m. at the family 's Tempe home on Saturday .
According to police reports she was intoxicated and acting aggressively toward her two daughters , ages 15 and 10 .
The two girls left the house , and when they came back around 6 p.m .
Antone began asking them for her keys , which were locked in a room .
The oldest daughter told Antone she could n't get into the room .
According to the release , Antone became angry by this and sprayed the girls with pepper spray .
She then fled the house .
Antone was found soon after by police at a neighborhood park near McArthur and George drives , where she was put under arrest on suspicion of aggravated assault .
As I was lazily watching tv , which seems to have become one of my pastimes as well as most of america ’s , a car commercial came on .
So you must be saying “ of course a car commercial came on !
theres one every other commercial ”
Well this commercial is different , because it has spawned my next music review !
This car commercial was playing catchy music , as most commercials do , and I actually knew the song !
It was 1901 by Phoenix .
Phoenix , is a french pop band that recently came out with a new album .
Wolfgang Amadeus Phoenix !
Perhaps their two most popular songs are 1901 and Lisztomania ( a play off of the famous composer ’s name ) .
Note :
These songs , as well as their song “ Girlfriend , ” can be most commonly heard on alternative and indie satelite stations .
Now to the review part .
Phoenix is really good driving music .
Their songs range from catchy and easy to blast on a nice day with all the windows down , to slow and mellow for those days you are just cruising along .
( Perhaps this is why they were featured in a car commercial ? )
My personal favorite , is Lisztomania .
Both fun to dance to and fun to sing it is the perfect song to lift up your spirits if you ’ve had a rough day
Also here ’s a link to their website :

The traditional way to measure an economy , the gross domestic product ( GDP ) , is getting a little outdated , according to the European Commission .
This is what the website EUobserver writes in an article today , quoting a statement of the Commission .
Gross Domestic
Product is a measure of a country 's economic performance represented by the market value of all final goods and services made in a year .
Instead , Brussels wants to come up with a new set of metrics that go beyond just what is valued by markets , and integrates those things that are a little less hard to pin a price tag on such as protecting the environment , an inclusive society and even happiness .
" GDP was not intended to be a measure of well - being .
It does n't pick up on issues that are vitally important to the quality of our lives such as a clean environment , social cohesion or even how happy people are " , the statement says .
It is expected in 2010 the Commission to propose an environmental index that will cover areas such as greenhouse gas emissions , loss of natural landscapes , air pollution , water use and waste generation .
This would complement rather than replace GDP , the statement points out .
Besides , the Commission says it aims to produce environmental and social data more rapidly .
At the moment , this sort of data is usually published after two to three years while key economic figures are released after just a few weeks .
" When a country cuts down all its forests and sells them as timber , this will increase GDP , but in the medium to long term , destroying this natural capital will not be beneficial for the country , the environment or the people " , the environment commissioner Stavros Dimas said after the publication of the document .
For example the hurricane Katrina caused some 1,800 deaths and over $ 100 billion in damages , but the economic activity that followed as a GDP indicator showed positive growth .
A lot of economic analysts have been criticizing the GDP as an incorrect measure of the economy for a long time because it does n't not measure the standard of living and does not include the disparity in incomes between the rich and poor into account and ignores externalities such as damage to the environment .
Some NGOs , quoted by EUobserver , noted that talks on moving beyond GDP have been going on a long time and very little change has occurred .
The economic aspects of climate change , biodiversity and environment are the issue of the meeting of the EU environment ministers in Stroemstad .
At this meeting the economist Pavan Sukhdev will present his estimation about the economic consequences of not dealing with environment issues .
" We must incorporate the values of biodiversity and ecosystem services , our Natural Capital , into our National Accounts .
As a fundamental first step towards integration , the value of forest carbon stock must begin to be captured in National Accounts .
Mainstreaming so - far unreflected ecosystem services and biodiversity benefits for the corporate and public sector is a later " , Mr. Sukhdev says .
The ecosystem services also should be reported .
For example , the economist says , coral reefs protection , the defense to fish nurseries and other services are worth up to $ 170 bn annually .
An estimated half a billion people depend on them for livelihoods and more than a quarter of all marine fish species are dependent on coral reefs .
" The economic consequences are significant , but so are the social and humanitarian ones .
A simple cost - benefit analysis alone will fail to capture the ethical dimensions of international climate and biodiversity policy decisions now and in the coming years and decades - especially in respect to an ecosystem at a climatic tipping point " , Mr. Sukhdev concludes .

Final August unemployment data was released yesterday with states indicating continued nonfarm payroll contraction going into the fall .
The Labor Department indicated an overall increase in unemployment in 27 states , a decrease in 16 and no change in 7 .
Record high jobless rates were reached in California ( 12.2 % ) , Nevada ( 13.2 % ) and Rhode Island ( 12.8 % ) ; the highest since widespread state data was first reported in 1976 .
California 's rate was influenced by the state budget passed in July which closed a US $ 24 billion shortfall by cutting many state - provided programs which included many state jobs .
Michigan , again , had the highest unemployment rate in August at 15.2 % which is nearly double its August 2008 unemployment rate of 8.6 % .
North Dakota , again , had the lowest unemployment rate at 4.3 % .
The current national unemployment rate is 9.7 % .
On the jobs - front , forty - two states lost jobs last month led by Texas , Michigan , Georgia , and Ohio , totalling over 216,000 jobs ; eight states recorded increases in job positions .
The biggest job gains were in North Carolina and Montana .
Since the recession began in December of 2007 , there have been nearly 7 million jobs lost nation - wide .
Data for September will be released in the first week of October .

In the same vein as the oft - asserted claim that leaving bottles of water on one ’s lawn will keep dogs from using that space as their personal lavatory is the belief that see - thru plastic bags filled with water and hung where flies can see them will keep those airborne pests at bay .
Numerous folks swear by the practice , with restaurant operators from the Florida Keys to Texas numbering among that group .
While the Internet - circulated how - to on repelling flies mandates the inclusion of four pennies in the bag , others who endorse the practice advocate placing only a single penny in each water - filled pouch , and others recommend using instead flakes of tin foil .
However , the most common array of this sort
is the unadorned bag of water , with such filled pouches to be either taped to one ’s doors or suspended in areas where flies are a particular problem .
As to whether this method works , some swear by it , while others who have tried it assert that such preventives do n’t deter the flies one whit .
Theories abound as to why such a practice might work .
Some practitioners claim that flies perceive such bags as the surface of a large body of water and therefore avoid them .
( This is a somewhat puzzling explanation , as flies are no strangers to ponds , puddles , lakes , and the like ) .
Others maintain that the flies are scared off at seeing their own magnified reflections in the water bags .
( Again , though , flies do n’t seem to shy away from other types of surfaces that reflect and / or magnify their images . )
The most common theory is that flies bases their sense of direction by where sunlight is coming from , and their complex eyes are overwhelmed and confused by the multi-directional refracted light produced by the bags , causing them to fly off rather than hang around .
Science has yet to provide a definitive answer either way .
In 2007 , Mike Stringham , a North Carolina State University ( NCSU ) researcher , reported on his findings after spending 13 weeks studying the effects of water bags on flies at an egg - packing plant .
After meticulously counting droppings left by flies on white “ spot cards , ” he concluded that the bags , rather than repelling the flying annoyances , actually attracted more of them .
Said Stringham , “ In the control room versus bags , the bags were consistently higher every time . ”
However , Stringham ’s study was conducted indoors under fluorescent and incandescent lighting , a factor which may limit its applicability : it ’s possible the effects of direct sunlight on the bags might produce a different result ( as sunlight in outdoor environments varies and dances in ways that unwavering manmade sources of light do not ) .
A December 2010 episode of Mythbusters found no significant difference between the number of flies attracted to a chamber holding both rotten meat and a plastic bag of water ( without coins ) and one which held only rotten meat .
As with the NCSU experiment , however , the results might have been an artifact of the particular setup used rather than proof of a general truism .
San Francisco Examiner columnist Richard Fagerlund ( aka “ Bugman ” ) has tackled this question ( in a decidedly unscientific way ) several times over the course of years :
Q : At a Mississippi drive - in , I questioned the waitress about the bag of water over the door , thinking it might be a prank .
I am 51 and had never come across this so I thought she was kidding when she told me it repelled flies .
She was familiar with its use last summer and was convinced that it is a valid theory .
I was motivated to look it up on the Internet .
What can you tell me about it ?
A : This is a result of a column I wrote a number of years ago and is worth repeating .
Fill a sandwich - size Ziploc bag about half full of water .
Tape the top of the bag to the outside of your door .
Replenish the water as needed .
It is not clear why these water bags repel flies , but they do .
I have gotten a ton of mail from all over the world when this column originally ran and the mail ran 9 to 1 saying this method worked .
You may also get some questions from visitors as to why you have a Ziploc bag of water on your front door .
Some possible answers are : It attracts flies .
It scares flies .
If it freezes , we know it ’s cold outside .
If it boils , we know it is hot outside .
I do n’t know , ask the Bug Man , it was his idea .
When you drive around town , look for Ziploc bags on doors and you will know who reads this column .
A possible explanation for the “ bags of water repel flies ” phenomenon is simple confirmation bias .
When people put up bags of water and notice a decrease in the amount of flies hanging around ( for reasons which are coincidental and have nothing to with any actual repellant qualities of the bags ) , they gleefully report far and wide that the method absolutely works .
But when people try it and obtain no noticeable positive results , they tend to simply forget about it and move on without publicizing the outcome of their efforts .
The British Ministry of Defense released 4,000 pages of documents detailing hundreds of UFO sightings between 1981 and 1996 .
A summary of the documents by UFO expert David Clarke comes as no surprise to scientists and skeptics : many of the sightings coincide with the release of popular sci- fi movies or television shows .
609 UFO sightings in 1996 , compared with 117 in 1995 correspond with the rise in popularity of the “ X Files ” television show and the release of the alien blockbuster film “ Independence Day . ”
“ Obviously , films and TV programs raise public awareness of UFOs and it ’s fascinating to see how that appears to lead more people to report what they see to the authorities , ” Clarke said .
The documents released include sightings reported by police officers and fighter pilots as well as young children , the Daily Mail reported Monday .
90 % of the sightings could be explained by mundane objects such as bright stars and planets , meteors , artificial satellites and airship advertising .
The other 10 % were listed as “ unexplained , ” mainly because of insufficient information .

Linux Foundation executive director Jim Zemlin has a message for Microsoft : he wants the software giant to stop attacking Linux .
Zemlin contends that Microsoft is engaged in a covert war against the open source operating system and that the company 's hostile behavior is detrimental to the growing number of Microsoft customers who deploy mixed Windows and Linux environments .
Zemlin's comments about Microsoft are a response to a patent auction carried out by Microsoft to sell a number of patents that the company allegedly said were related to Linux .
The patents , which were originally obtained by Microsoft from SGI , were sold to Allied Security Trust ( AST ) , a patent - holding group that grants its members perpetual licenses before reselling the patents .
Zemlin suggests that Microsoft 's intention was to surreptitiously slip the intellectual property to a patent troll that would then go after Linux companies .
This tactic would allow Microsoft to launch an indirect assault against the open source operating system while largely insulating the company from retaliatory patent litigation by The Open Invention Network ( OIN ) , a patent - holding group that uses its intellectual property portfolio to protect Linux .
Zemlin says that the plot was thwarted , however , because " Microsoft got caught . "
OIN is buying the patents from AST , and Zemlin characterizes this move as a victory for Linux because it will effectively take the patents out of circulation and ensure that they are never obtained by patent trolls .
" By selling patents that target Linux , Microsoft could help generate fear , uncertainty , and doubt about Linux , without needing to attack the Linux community directly in their own name , " Zemlin wrote in a blog entry .
" This deal [ between OIN and AST ] shows the mechanisms the Linux industry has constructed to defend Linux are working , even though the outcome also shows Microsoft to continue to act antagonistically to its customers . "
A growing number of companies use a combination of Windows and open source technologies to power their software infrastructure .
Microsoft has been engaging with the open source software community and proclaiming its commitment to interoperability as part of a broader strategy to accommodate mixed deployments .
Recent examples include Microsoft joining the Apache Foundation and contributing Hyper - V drivers to the Linux kernel .
Despite these positive moves to boost interoperability , the company still exhibits a confrontational posture towards Linux .
Microsoft 's recent patent infringement lawsuit against Linux - based navigation device maker TomTom over its use of an open source FAT implementation is one such example .
Microsoft also spreads egregious disinformation about Linux in its efforts to slow uptake of the open source operating system in regular consumer channels .
Critics are increasingly frustrated with Microsoft 's hypocrisy and mixed messages .
Microsoft 's attacks on Linux are an attack against the company 's own customers , Zemlin argues , because so many companies run mixed environments .
He calls for such companies to send a message to Microsoft and tell the company that anti-Linux shenanigans are unappreciated .
" The reality is that Windows and Linux will both remain critical parts of the world 's computing infrastructure for years to come , " he wrote .
" Those customers , who have the ear of Microsoft CEO Steve Ballmer , need to tell Microsoft that they do not want Microsoft 's patent tricks to interfere with their production infrastructure .
It 's time for Microsoft to stop secretly attacking Linux while publicly claiming to want interoperability .
Let 's hope that Microsoft decides going forward to actually try to win in the marketplace , rather than continuing to distract and annoy us with their tricky patent schemes . "
This is not the first time that Microsoft has been accused of attacking Linux by proxy .
Microsoft helped fund SCO 's misguided anti-Linux litigation by purchasing a SCOsource license and may also have played a critical role in helping SCO secure a major investment from BayStar Capital .
Microsoft 's latest maneuver with the patent auction could refuel suspicions about the company 's agenda on Linux and interoperability .
The " drive - by ” statute is usually a charge reserved for " gangbangers , ” Oklahoma County District Attorney David Prater said .
On Friday , Prater filed the felony charge against two Oklahoma City police officers .
" If these off - duty officers want to conduct themselves that way , that ’s exactly how we ’ll treat them — just like any other gangbanger , ” Prater said .
Sgt. Diron Carter , an eight - year veteran , and Sgt. Michael W. McKethan , a seven - year veteran , were charged Friday with " using a vehicle to facilitate the intentional discharge of a firearm , ” in a drive - by shooting that occurred in mid-June outside Night Trips , a strip club near Meridian and Reno avenues .
Carter and McKethan were booked into the Oklahoma County jail on Friday afternoon and released on $ 25,000 bail each .
Prosecutors allege in the charge that McKethan , 34 , was behind the wheel of a white Tahoe and was driving away from the club when Carter , 30 , fired a pistol " in the direction of several bystanders . ”
No one was hurt by the bullet that had to be cut out of a metal wall at a nearby laundry supply business , but prosecutors say someone could have been killed .
Shots fired outside bar
On June 16 as Night Trips was closing , police got a call that shots had been fired outside the bar .
Witnesses told police a man in a white sport utility vehicle was throwing beer bottles as he drove through the strip club parking lot , according to the police report .
When the witnesses confronted the men in the car and asked " what their problem was , ” an argument began to escalate until the passenger in the car reportedly leaned out of the window with a black handgun and said ‘ You want to see my baby Glock ? ” as he fired a single shot .
Police responding to the scene soon learned McKethan and Carter had been there that night and that McKethan , who drives a white Chevy Tahoe , had a conversation earlier with one of the strippers whose child may be McKethan ’s , according to a probable cause affidavit .
Carter admitted being at the club that night , but he denied being involved in any incident in which a shot was fired , the affidavit states .
Later when Carter was questioned by a fellow officer , Carter allegedly replied " it was an accidental shooting , ” the affidavit states .
Officers also recovered a .40 - caliber shell casing in the street , which Prater said came from a " baby Glock ” which is an off - duty weapon used by police officers .
‘ We police our own ’
An officer being charged in a case involving strippers , beer and firing a weapon at bystanders can be perceived as a " black eye ” on the entire department , said Capt .
Steve McCool , the police department ’s spokesman .
" But we would hope the citizens would understand that once we gained this information , we immediately put them on leave , ” McCool said .
" We investigated it thoroughly .
We did what was right , and we police our own . ”
When a crime is committed , McCool said , it does n’t matter whether the person responsible is a citizen or an officer , they will be subject to the law .
Prater said it ’s disappointing to receive cases involving police officers .
" Because that ’s not the way the majority of these outstanding men and women in law enforcement conduct themselves , ” he said .
" But if you ’re involved in criminal activity , I do n’t care what you do for a living .
You ’re going to be held responsible and accountable in this office . ”

Q : Dear Webmaster down under ,
we are a middle - aged couple and have a little son of 6 who is very fond of animals .
We thought of getting him an Australian pet and like to have your advice :
Should it be a young croc , a koala or a cangaroo ?
And should we employ an aboriginal nanny at the same time to help our son getting along with the strange pet ?
A : Dear Fritz and Gretchen , the choice of the right pet depends on a few factors ;
The crocodile will need water to swim , so you need to have a swimming pool or live near a lake .
Your Aboriginal nanny will have to work seven days a week and watch the croc all the time , as the croc will grow and when it gets to about one and a half metre it can eat your son .
The koala will need to eat eucalyptus leaves , so you must have some of these trees in your garden , or in a nearby park where the Aboriginal nanny can walk the koala every day , but it must be kept on a leash as otherwise the koala can climb high up a tree and then when it gets stoned from eating the eucalyptus leaves it will fall asleep and not come down again for a few days .
If you get a big size kangaroo then your son can sit in the pouch and enjoy to ride around , but you will need a big house and a big garden to give the kangaroo enough space to jump around , the Aboriginal nanny can probably train the kangaroo to take your son to school and pick up again in the afternoon .
I hope this will help you to choose the right pet .
Q : I have just moved to Australia and am not sure if you can buy kangaroo teeth in the supermarket .
what do you suggest ?
A : Did you mean meat or teeth ?
ASK US A QUESTION
Cuban children cannot access vital medicine , Amnesty claims
The US should lift sanctions on Cuba as a prelude to dropping its " immoral " trade embargo against the island , Amnesty International has urged .
US President Barack Obama has until 14 September to decide whether or not to extend the Trading with the Enemy Act , under which sanctions are imposed .
The embargo is preventing Cubans from accessing life - saving medicine , says Amnesty Secretary General Irene Khan .
The US began its embargo in 1960 , tightening it two years later .
This was largely as a result of Cuba 's alliance with the then Soviet Union .
Mr Obama has insisted that the trade ban will stay in place until Cuba frees political prisoners and improves human rights .
' Vital medicines '
But London - based rights organisation Amnesty is concerned that the embargo is endangering the lives of Cubans .
" The US embargo against Cuba is immoral and should be lifted , " said Ms Khan .
" It 's preventing millions of Cubans from benefiting from vital medicines and medical equipment essential for their health . "
Cuba 's inability to import nutritional products from the US has led to an increase in the number of cases of iron deficiency anaemia , according to a report produced by Amnesty , using data from the UN .
Some 37.5 % of Cuban children under the age of three have been affected by the ban on nutritional products , the report suggests .
Since 2000 , when the US Congress passed The Trade Sanction Reform and Export Enhancement Act , the Cuban government has been able to import food from the US .
However , it must pay cash and is not allowed credit .
According to Cuban government figures , it has spent more than $ 4bn on direct purchases of food from the US since 2001 .
US legislation allows Cuba to purchase some medicines , but Havana chooses not to buy directly , opting instead to purchase US medicine from third countries .
The embargo was first imposed in the wake of the revolution in Cuba , which swept Fidel Castro to power .
The US wanted to force the island to reject Mr Castro 's socialist policies and embrace capitalism and democracy .
Mr Obama has indicated that he favours a softening in US - Cuban relations , and has lifted the ban on Cuban - Americans visiting the island and sending money back to relatives who still live there .
The Cuban government , now led by Mr Castro 's brother Raul , has said it is willing to enter negotiations with Washington , but will not make any unilateral concessions .

Five former Blackwater guards have been indicted in federal court on charges related to the 2007 episode .
A spokeswoman for Xe did not respond to a request for comment .
For its intelligence work , the company ’s sprawling headquarters in North Carolina has a special division , known as Blackwater Select .
The company ’s first major arrangement with the C.I.A. was signed in 2002 , with a contract to provide security for the agency ’s new station in Kabul , Afghanistan .
Blackwater employees assigned to the Predator bases receive training at Nellis Air Force Base in Nevada to learn how to load Hellfire missiles and laser - guided smart bombs on the drones , according to current and former employees , who asked not to be identified for fear of upsetting the company .
The C.I.A. has for several years operated Predator drones out of a remote base in Shamsi , Pakistan , but has secretly added a second site at an air base in Jalalabad , Afghanistan , several current and former government and company officials said .
The existence of the Predator base in Jalalabad has not previously been reported .
Officials said the C.I.A. now conducted most of its Predator missile and bomb strikes on targets in the Afghanistan - Pakistan border region from the Jalalabad base , with drones landing or taking off almost hourly .
The base in Pakistan is still in use .
But officials said that the United States decided to open the Afghanistan operation in part because of the possibility that the Pakistani government , facing growing anti-American sentiment at home , might force the C.I.A. to close the one in Pakistan .
Blackwater is not involved in selecting targets or actual strikes .
The targets are selected by the C.I.A. , and employees at the agency ’s headquarters in Langley , Va. , pull the trigger remotely .
Only a handful of the agency ’s employees actually work at the Predator bases in Afghanistan and Pakistan , the current and former employees said .
They said that Blackwater ’s direct role in these operations had sometimes led to disputes with the C.I.A .
Sometimes when a Predator misses a target , agency employees accuse Blackwater of poor bomb assembly , they said .
In one instance last year recounted by the employees , a 500 - pound bomb dropped off a Predator before it hit the target , leading to a frantic search for the unexploded bomb in the remote Afghan - Pakistani border region .
It was eventually found about 100 yards from the original target .
The role of contractors in intelligence work expanded after the Sept. 11 attacks , as spy agencies were forced to fill gaps created when their work forces were reduced during the 1990s , after the end of the cold war .

The Union Bar Lounge in midtown Houston , Texas refused to serve nearly 100 gay patrons , leaving them to wait in the rain while the bar was empty and heterosexuals were being ushered inside .
Patrons started lining up at about 9:40 p.m. and were told to wait in line and not allowed inside , even as straight - appearing people were waved through .
As the line grew and patrons waited in the rain , employees at the door told those who were that they were maintaining a “ ratio . ”
Later , the bar employees simply indicated they had the right to refuse anyone .
“ I was shocked to be a victim of that kind of discrimination in a city like Houston in 2009 , ” said Neal Falgoust , a Houston law student .
“ I have never experienced anything like that before in my life . ”
A patron who arrived at the bar early reported that the bar was nearly empty at about 9:40 p.m. , when gay people started arriving and were stopped at the door .
Gay people continued to line up to the street and around the corner as people who appeared to be straight went to the front and were ushered in .
Kris Banks , who stood at the front of the line , said the bar employees were asking the women who were entering with men if the men were accompanying them .
If the men were with the women , they were allowed in .
“ I arrived and heard that they were not allowing gay men in , so when I got to the door with three women I asked if we would be allowed in , and the door employee said ‘ I was told to keep you out , ’ ” said Lindsey Dionne .
“ This was supposed to be a social event , but now it ’s political . ”
That this kind of discrimination is still legal in Houston makes it more outrageous .
A coalition of GLBT rights groups , including the Houston GLBT Political Caucus , the Houston Stonewall Young Democrats , the Harris County Impact Houston and Amicus at South Texas College of Law said Saturday that the incident is proof of the necessity of legal protections for sexual orientation and gender identity for public accommodations .
“ Houston is the only major city in Texas without a law that prevents this kind of discrimination , ” said Jerry Simoneaux , GLBT civil rights lawyer .
“ This incident is exactly the reason Houston should implement such an ordinance . ”
The event was organized as Houston ’s first “ Guerilla Gay Bar , ” a tongue - in - cheek event that has been popular in other cities in which GLBT individuals come to traditionally straight bars to interact with other communities .
Though Guerilla Gay Bars are usually a surprise event in other cities , Houston organizers informed the bar owner in advance out of courtesy and were told they would be welcomed ( Capitol Annex ) .
The fact that the bar was told in advance that a large gay crowd was coming was not even necessary , since when does one need to RSVP to a bar ?
The bar said they would be welcome , and then decided to discriminate against them .
People are already leaving negative reviews on their yelp page .

The global video business lost more than US $ 2.6bn in 2008 due to a combination of a fall in both DVD purchases and rentals by consumers .
According to Screen Digest , internationally last year consumers spent US $ 26.4bn on video software , while two - thirds of that was spent on buying DVD discs .
This represents a 3.6 pc drop on 2007 spend , and a 4.7 pc drop on disc sales alone .
The sales figures are in line with the overall trend that saw consumer spending plateau between 2004 and 2007 and the North American market starting to decline in 2007 , signalling the start of a global downward trend .
The high - definition ( HD ) Blu-ray ( BD ) format was heralded by the industry as the answer to the decline of DVD .
However , the format war with Toshiba ’s HD DVD meant the strong , unified marketing that had worked so successfully for DVD ’s launch a decade earlier was not replicated .
This , coupled with a worldwide recession in consumer spending and the easy availability of video via other means such as downloading , pirate , legal and illegal temporary ownership , ensured that despite strong sales of BD discs in 2008 of US $ 482 m , they barely made a dent in the missing revenue .
The physical rental market is coming under pressure from many sides , including ever - cheaper disc sales , piracy , downloading and legal and illegal temporary ownership .
As mass - market rental chains adopt ever more aggressive pricing strategies to keep customers , online rental services such as LoveFilm International in Europe and Quickflix in Australia have helped ease the decline of physical rental .
However , online rental is not effective in all markets .
Three countries that have experienced double - digit growth in consumer spend in 2008 are China , India and Russia .
At present , their combined spend accounts for only 4 pc of the international total ( US$ 979 m ) , therefore placing the combined countries just ahead of Italy in international rankings .
Whilst this is small , these markets have attracted the eye of the Hollywood studios as a result of their performance .
“ We expect BD to account for 6.9 pc of international video spending this year – assuming there is strong promotional activity , ” explained Helen Davis Jayalath , senior analyst at Screen Digest .
“ However , despite consumers ’ interest in the HD format and demand for packaged media , the current challenging economic climate means that we do n’t expect BD to be driving even minimal sector growth until 2010 . ”

Improving the world : 100 % solar - powered aircraft unveiled
Betrand Piccard and André Borschberg together launched the Solar Impulse Project in 2003 , with the objective of constructing aircraft designed to run with renewable energy from the sun .
After a lot of hard work , they were finally able to unveil their first working model last June 26 .
Dubbed the Solar Impulse HB - SIA , the new aircraft is powered entirely by solar energy .
It has a wingspan equivalent to a Boeing 747 ‘s completely laden with solar cells , but it comes weighing in at approximately the same weight as an automobile .
The 12,000 solar panels running along the wings can generate 10HP of electricity : enough to power the aircrafts four rotors .
The HB - SIA is planned to make its first flights at the end of this year , and nighttime flights are also slated for 2010 .
Data from the HB - SIA ’s flights will be used to design an improved version , currently dubbed the HB - SIB .
One of this site ’s readers , Zach Williams sent me this news clip from February .
In this short clip , economist Stephen Moore explains that on top the national debt that is talked about , we actually have several other national debts .
These debts include future Social Security and Medicare obligations that are above what expected contributions will be , as well as insurance guarantees made by our government .
Im pretty sure that this does not include most of the $ 12,800,000,000,000 [ $ 12.8 trillion ] that I reported has been spent and / or promised for bailouts and “ stimulus . ”
The total listed in this clip is $ 78,800,000,000,000 [ $ 78.8 trillion ] .
This is higher than the GDP for the entire world was in 2008 .
This is quite scary to me .
I dont see how this wont lead to us printing massive amounts of money to cover this debt , seeing how there isnt enough money in the world to pay it off .
Of course , if we add another $ 12,800,000,000,000 [ $ 12.8 trillion ] , than things are going to look even worse .

I officially graduated last weekend ending an undergraduate effort that started at the University of Texas at Austin 20 years ago in 1989 and stalled in a hiatus that turned into a full - time career .
With the help of my employer ’s generous tuition reimbursement plan and the flexibility of the distance learning program at the UMass I finally managed to not only wrap things up and earn a BS in Information Systems , but in doing so earned the Chancellor ’s Medal for Academic Achievement .
Who knew I had it in me to graduate at the top of my class for my college ?
The experience of going back to school so many years later has been eye opening and has provided a lot of context to my recruiting efforts for greenhorn programmers .
That is , I ’ve walked a mile in their shoes and seen what is currently being taught in college level Information Technology programs .
The Good News
Contrary to my expectations forged from my previous collegiate experience , the problem of professors teaching outdated technology and theory has been remedied to a considerable degree , at least in the UMASS program .
Many of the classes were taught by adjunct professors that worked at least part time in the real world in addition to their academic duties .
This made the lessons much more relevant and practical .
Also , I ’m glad to see they have moved on from Turbo Pascal and 68000 Assembly , but then I am dating myself .
The Bad News
The curriculum is still very centered on learning specific technologies and was conspicuously weak on best practices or practical preparation for aspects of software engineering outside the scope of software construction .
Given the relatively small percentage of time that a working programmer spends on writing code versus other elements of the software construction process , this is not ideal .
As a hiring manager , I ’d greatly prefer graduates with a good grasp of basic software construction and project management skills than proficiency in a specific programming languages .
Software platforms exhibit such a short half - life that I ’d question the long term value of them anyway aside from the foundational ones like C++.
Concepts such as those described in the canons of programming literature like Code Complete and The Mythical Man-Month , can provide more lasting value over the life of a programmer ’s career .
Proposed Curriculum for Software Engineers
The following course of study is a recommendation based on the skills that I ’d like to see when I interview entry level software developers .
I am not saying that existing programs do n’t include some or all of these elements , but I rarely see many of these skills when interviewing recent college graduates .
I ’ve broken the topics out for clarity , but clearly some should be combined or split into multiple courses .
Freshman Year –

Overview of Operating Systems : Working knowledge and exposure to at least 3 of the most commonly used operating systems , i.e. Windows , Linux , OSX , etc .

Wow , that was a wild episode with an explosive ending -- literally .
This episode played up the social issues a lot almost to the point of excess as it was in our faces all the time though I think the writers were trying to make a point with this episode .
After Godric saves Sookie , he kills the begging Gabe and then Eric arrives .
Godric tells Eric to take Sookie to leave and that he is staying behind .
The lock down is starting so it will be difficult to get out .
It turns out that Sarah had just used a paintball gun .
He learns that the Fellowship of the Sun has Sookie capture , so Jason goes off after her .
Eric and Sookie try to get away but are captured .
Lorena , Bill 's maker starts biting Barry the bellhop and so Bill saves him , bashing her over the head with a TV , managing to escape .
He finds Hoyt and Jessica doing it and tells Hoyt to take Jessica back to Bon Temps .
Bill shows up to the FotS church and Steve points a gun at Sookie .
Jason shows up and somehow shoots
Steve in the hand with the paintball gun , giving Bill the chance to save Sookie .
Suddenly all these vampires enter the church and start killing people before being stopped by Godric who lets everyone leave .
The vampires , Sookie , and Jason end of at Godric 's nest where Bill is being evasive .
Jason has an awkward talk with Bill , apologizing and there are a bunch of other random conversations revolving around how Godric does n't want to fight humans .
The writers kept hitting us over the head with the idea that Godric wants vampires to change and be regular people , and wants people on both sides to be forgiving .
Eventually , Lorena shows up looking for Bill where she and Sookie go head to head .
It a pretty awesome scene that is fairly long and ends with Lorena trying to kill Sookie which Godric stops , and he kicks her out .
Back in Bon Temps , Sam is in deep trouble .
He find Daphne in his freezer with her heart ripped out .
The police question him and then lock him up .
Andy Belflour tries to support Sam , but being durnk and seemingly crazy , he does little to help Sam 's case .
Meanwhile , we see Maryann with the heart cooking it .
I can't believe how long they showed it , but at least it was n't still beating .
She actually cuts it into strips and throws it with other ingredients .
Later , she had a soufflé which Tara and Eggs eat .
They go into the black eyed state and start hitting each other .
Near the end of the episode , we see and unknown man walking toward the nest .
In the end , it is revealed to be Luke who is looking a little puffy .
He opens his jacket which is strapped with a bomb .
He detonates it , and from the promo for next week , the whole place is destroyed .
Jessica and Hoyt continue to have sex problems .
They start up again once at Bill 's house , but Jessica starts bleeding .
Apparently , her hymen regrows like the rest of her body with the super - healing .
Who knows how other vampires deal with it ?
I 'm sure this conversation with Bill will be awkward .
I like how this episode took the focus away from Maryann and focused on vampire culture .
I like how Lorena was humanized and I actually felt sorry for her .
Godric seems like a pacifist , and paid for it with the bomb .
The humans were given a chance , but we they go wild once the nest is destroyed ?
There is one vampire in particular who seems opposed to Godric 's compromises .
I 'm looking forward to see how the vampire story progresses , Maryann 's , not so much .
Score : 9.8/10
When I first met my Aunty Ada – my Dad Bill took me up to Birkenhead to meet her , along with Peggy , my Mum – she did nothing but pour cups of tea .
Ada ran a shoe store but spent the entire day with us .
Tea .
Tea .
" Another cup of tea , love ? "
And she would n't take no for an answer .
" Good God ! "
Bill exclaimed later .
" Did I drink that much tea when I lived up here ? "
He thought maybe tea had caught on in Liverpool because that 's where the old tea clipper sailing ships – on which my grandfather Edward sailed – arrived from China .
And tea , of course , originally came from China , invented in 2,750 BC after the leaves of Camellia sinensis accidentally fell into a bowl of hot water in front of the Emperor Shen Nung .
He liked the smell and poured himself the world 's first cup of tea .
True to all British history , we took a long time to catch up .
Our first tea came from Holland in 1650 , initially referred to as " tay " from the Dutch thee , a version of the Fujian t'e .
This I have on the authority of a fine and unique academic treatise on tea by one A R T Kemasang who is soon to publish an entire book in Indonesia ( of all places ) on China 's role in civilising the West .
In eastern Europe and in the Arab world it became known as chai from the Cantonese ch'a .
Where I live , in Lebanon , the chai is served up in kettles , already swamped with sugar – though never served with milk .
A secret , now , from the Arab world .
Western soldiers in the Middle East are always encouraged to drink 12 litres of water every day .
Long ago , in the deserts of Syria , Jordan and Saudi Arabia , I learned differently .
The Arabs will drink tea at dawn to warm them up – often poured from a great height , at arm 's length – and then they will drink tea in the burning heat of midday to cool them down .
Then they will drink tea at dusk to warm them up again .
I do just the same on my balcony in Beirut .
It works .
" Water makes you perspire , " an old Syrian friend once told me .
" Then you have to drink more water to make up for lost water .
They you perspire again ... "
( So is there a military conspiracy going on here , I wonder , by the bottled water companies ? )

The East India Company brought tea to India in the 19th century and enjoyed a brief monopoly in the British Isles until Charles Bewley turned up in Dublin with 2,000 chests of the stuff in 1835 , directly from China .
Earlier , the Great and the Good of English society had actually condemned the stuff .
William Cobbett ( he of Rural Rides ) and Methodist John Wesley ( who thought tea caused " paralytick disorders " ) treated tea as if it were alcohol .
Sydney Smith , however , gave it a seal of approval .
" Thank God for tea ! " he announced .
" What would the world do without tea ?
I am glad I was not born before tea . "
And I can see why .
As Kemasang explains , before tea there were few ways to keep warm in England .
Water was filthy and disease ridden .
The mass of Britons shivered all night in their unheated homes .
Kemasang quotes a 15th century schoolboy whose diary entry reads : " The moste part of this winter my handes were so swellynge with colde that I coulde nother holde my penn for to wrytt nother my knyff for to cutt my mete at the table . "
Milk had its problems too .
Here 's Tobias Smollett on the trade in fresh milk which is " carried through the streets in open pails , exposed to foul rinsings discharged from doors and windows , spittle , snot , and tobacco quids ... overflowing from mud carts , spatterings from coach wheels , dirt and trash chucked into it by rogueish boys ... the spewing of infants ... " .
Yes , I shall stop here , for it is Saturday morning , O Reader .
I shall not mention here the American predilection for coffee , nor the Boston Tea Party which arguably lost us America .
Think only of tea .
What words it brought us .
A Hokkien weight unit equivalent to just over a pound was called a kati .
Hence our tea caddy .
But wait .
Time for a diversion .
How many readers know that in 1859 , fighting off the Indian mutineers , the British army found that its soldiers – wearing white , of course – were being cut down by musket fire .
Soldiers were thus ordered to rub brown dust into their uniforms .
The Urdu for dust is khak .
Thus we now dress our soldiers – even in Afghanistan today – in khaki uniforms .
I thought I 'd reveal this after reading it in an Egyptian newspaper the other day .
And one more for the road .
Rereading my schoolboy 's copy of Group Captain Johnnie Johnson 's Wing Leader this week – he was the top - scoring Allied flying ace of the Second World War – I found that the emergency " Mayday " comes from the French M'aidez !.
Before tea , needless to say , millions of Brits warmed themselves with alcohol – which only gives the illusion of warmth .
The real effect – as Kemasang makes perfectly clear – is that most people were drinking cider , beer , gin or wine most of the time and were most of the time inebriated .
Even the Crusaders , some say , were drunk when they rode into the Holy Land .
Molière , La Fontaine and Racine drank wine .
A hundred years later , Beaumarchais and Voltaire were drinking tea .
In the 18th century , London was unsafe after dark .
Hogarth 's Gin Lane shows what it was like during the day .
Tea changed all that .
A sober working class could labour for long hours in the great factories and mines and shipyards of the industrial revolution .
Hence tea helped the British Empire to grow economically into the strongest power on earth .
It was a poor Lebanese family in southern Lebanon that first insisted to me that tea could prevent cancer .
And subsequent research – especially in China – suggests that this is absolutely true .
Especially green tea , though this is more popular in Afghanistan and Pakistan than in the Middle East , where they like it black and strong .
So do I these days .
No Arab meal can be concluded without it .
And now it 's like a narcotic for me .
Writing a feature at 6 am in Los Angeles or a report in Tehran at 11 pm , I send for a cuppa .
My Aunty Ada would have agreed .
Yesterday on Meet the Press they reviewed the declining prospects for the Republican Party .
And the yawning conclusion was that no one can really challenge Barack Obama in 2012 and no one can revive the G.O.P .
They assessed the prospects of all the possible candidates but there was one glaring omission .
Guess who ?
Mitt Romney and Lindsey Graham were the Republican guest commentators .
Romney has already made it clear that only an Obama owned recession will allow him back in .
And if Obama ca n’t get a temporary bump in the stock market , after trebling the money supply , well , we might as all start selling apples right now .
And one by one , on the Russertless Meet the Press , they ticked off all of the reasons why Sarah Palin and Mike Huckabee wo n’t be returning after all .
Of course , the weekly news dominated and they bemoaned the loss of yet another possible G.O.P. standard bearer for 2012 .
Mark Sanford , the governor of South Carolina , is now out .
His dalliance in Argentina means he is damaged goods .
Ca n’t you just see the governor sitting at a side walk café in Buenos Aires , with this nagging worry in the back of his head , “ What if they are looking for me right now ?
What if I am on CNN ?
Naaa . ”
Indeed , the Sanford episode brings back all the painful narrative surrounding the infidelities of Newt Gingrich and Rudolph Giuliani .
Is there no one left to lead the G.O.P.?
Meet the Press cannot be blamed for omitting the one man who is still on everyone ’s lips , as in “ you know , I think he may have been right , after all . ”
The one man who predicted the economic collapse , who suggested that the Federal Reserve needed an audit itself , who warned that electing a Democrat or Republican was pretty much the same thing ; there would still be a war where we do n’t need one .
The lobbyists would still rule .
The government would still intrude .
On May 18 , 2009
Time magazine ran a cover story on the Republican Party , entitled “ Endangered Species . ”
They had a Michael Grunwald article on “ How the Republicans Lost Their Way . ”
And an article by Joe Scarborough on “ How They Can Come Back . ”
Not once did the magazine even mention the name of the man who raised $ 32 million with a single call .
The man who was first to recognize and announce that Republicans had lost their way , their heart , their soul .
What made the Mark Sanford loss so regrettable to many in the press was the fact that he was emerging as a bit of a populist figure .
He had been able to articulate some of the views and the ideas of the one man whom Meet the Press and Time Magazine and the rest of the establishment so studiously ignore .
And Sanford had been able to pick up the mantle without all the odious , dangerous extra baggage that makes the people at the television networks recoil in horror .
Like actually auditing the Federal Reserve .
The fact is that Mark Sanford was never really a true clone to that man , who like Lord Voldemort , can not be named .
The man who would shake Wall Street and Capitol Hill to their foundations .
I am speaking , of course , of Congressman Ron Paul of Texas
No , he is not dead , much as Meet the Press and Time would have you believe .
Tim Russert is dead .
Michael Jackson is dead .
Farrah Fawcett is dead .
And now even , Billy May is dead .
Ron Paul lives .
And as long as Ron Paul lives , the heart of the Republican Party beats strong and an alternative to the new Socialist Republic of America still exists .
Make sure you read … .
Is Ron Paul too old ?
And see Reagan and the age issue .

Quotations
From 1000 - 1500 , China led the world in economic development .
As trade between China and Europe begins to expand from 1550 onwards , the Chinese economy is , by many measures , more productive than Europe's .
( Map 1 below )
Comparing the leading economic region in Europe ( England ) and in China ( the Yangzi delta ) in the period from 1500 to 1800 , we find that these two regions perform quite similarly .
The population of the Lower Yangzi Region in China is roughly as well off as the population of England at this time .

ConocoPhillips is now actively campaigning against the House climate and energy bill — even though it ’s a member of the U.S. Climate Action Partnership , an influential enviro - business coalition that played a key role in shaping the legislation .
The company changed its tune shortly after the House passed the bill .
On the ConocoPhillips website , visitors are urged to “ Act now for energy .
Make your voice heard ! ”
An action page tells people to contact their senators and express opposition to the bill , arguing , “ Federal climate change legislation is needed ; however , Waxman - Markey fell short . ”
The shift is notable since ConocoPhillips is a marquee member of USCAP , which brought together green groups like the Environmental Defense Fund and the Natural Resources Defense Council and major companies like Duke Energy , BP , and General Electric around a climate - bill blueprint .
Red Cavaney , senior vice president for government and public affairs for ConocoPhillips , even testified before the Energy and Commerce Committee in support of climate action in April .
But ConocoPhillips is also a member of the American Petroleum Institute , which has been orchestrating astroturfing against the climate bill .
While Shell , another company that belongs to both USCAP and API , has announced that it will not support the astroturf efforts , ConocoPhillips has remained silent on the matter .
On its action page , ConocoPhillips repeats familiar criticisms of climate legislation :
As it deliberates its own bill , the Senate must carefully review the consequences of any legislation on the economy and on ordinary Americans .
Climate change legislation will result in higher direct energy costs for the typical American family .
Estimates of the increased costs range from $ 150 to $ 1,000 or more per year .
It also could result in a net loss of more than two million U.S. jobs each year .
ConocoPhillips claims that the bill does not do enough to protect domestic oil refiners , despite the fact that it gives them 2 percent of pollution - permit value under a cap - and - trade system .
And , predictably , the company argues that the bill should do more to keep the price of oil low for consumers .
It also wants the bill to do more to encourage the development of natural gas in the United States , “ which is nature ’s cleanest fossil fuel . ”
ConocoPhillips just happens to be one of the country ’s largest producers of natural gas .
“ Do n’t attempt to pick winners or losers among energy technologies , ” the company argues .
“ Legislative proposals have a tendency to pick ‘ winning ’ energy technologies too early , before they are fully proven at scale .

“ Our life is frittered away by detail … simplify , simplify . ” – Henry David Thoreau
Post written by Leo Babauta .
Follow me on Twitter .
A lot of people seem to connect with my message of simplicity , and yearn to find a simpler life in this world of ever - increasing complexity , of overwhelming technology .
We want to take the good things in our lives , the benefits of technology , but simplify things , get rid of the complexities .
And while I ’ve written dozens of articles on simplifying ( and an entire book on it ) , I ’d like to offer a simple method .
Something you can do today , without being overwhelmed .
A 12 - step method , perhaps , simplified into just 6 steps .
1. Write down your top priorities .
We all have a long list of things we want to do , to try , to learn , to accomplish .
Just pick 4 - 5 . You can do that right now — make a short list of the things that are most important to you .
My list : spending time with my family , writing , reading and running .
These are the things you ’ll build your life around , for now .
You can always change this list later , as your priorities change .
2. Reduce one commitment .
What is something you do every day or week that ’s not on your short list ?
Is there any way you can get out of it ?
Make a phone call or send an email right now that will get you out of that commitment .
It might mean disappointing one or many people — but you are going to create the simple life you want , not the complicated life others demand of you .
By reducing this one commitment , you are simplifying your life , creating more time and space for the important stuff .
Make the choice to put your priorities first , to find the time for them , by reducing your commitments .
3. Simplify your to - do list .
Same concept , but at a smaller level — what ’s on your to - do list that does n’t need to be there ?
Something you ’ve been dreading that you do n’t absolutely have to do ?
Can you tell someone you ’re just too busy to work on this ?
Can you give it to someone else , or automate it ?
See if you can pare your to - do list to just the most important things .
Alternatively , just pick 1 - 3 things to do each day , and do n’t worry about the rest .
4 . Set aside some disconnected time .
If you ’re connected all the time , this step is essential .
Do n’t skip it !
Pick one hour to be disconnected — no Internet , no email , no IM , no phones .
You can use your computer , but just for desktop computing , like writing in a word processor or text file , or working in Photoshop , or what have you .
Use this time to really focus , to pour yourself into important tasks that you love to do .
Or you can use this disconnected time to relax .
5. Create your perfect day .
You ’ve blocked aside some disconnected time , but let ’s take that a step further : what would your ideal day look like ?
What would you do when you woke up , what would your work day look like ( hint : it does n’t have to be the work you ’re doing now , but it could be ) , would you have time for exercise or sports or taking a walk or relaxing or reading or doing a hobby , would you have time for loved ones , time to clean or do errands , time for checking email , etc . ?
List the things you ’d do , ideally , then simplify to the most important ones .
Then lay them out in a schedule .
You do n’t have to stick to this schedule exactly , but knowing what ’s ideal gives you something to work toward .
In some cases , you can simply start living this day , tomorrow , but in others you ’ll have to make gradual changes to allow this ideal day to happen .
The key : taking control and responsibility for making the perfect day a reality .
6. Declutter .
You want a nice , decluttered , serene space to surround you in your new simplified life .
So you ’re going to create it .
Two ways to go here : if you do n’t have much time , just do 10 - 15 minutes for now , and continue to do small increments until you get to where you ’d like to be .
Here ’s how .
Second method is if you have an entire day or weekend — set aside a big block of time and just overhaul your workspace or one or two rooms in your home .
Here ’s a good method .
Next Steps
Once you get to this stage , things should be a bit more simplified .
But you ’re probably interested in going beyond that .
Here ’s what you can do next — but please , please , do n’t try to do these all at once .
Pick one at a time , and do it slowly , over time .
Simplifying is n’t a race — it ’s a life .
Declutter some more .
Read .
Letting go of wanting to buy more .
Read .
Reducing more commitments .
Read .
Transitioning to doing only work you love .
Read .
Creating time for solitude , quiet and relaxation .
Read .
Slowing down in everything you do .
Read .
Being present more often .
Read .
Single - tasking .
Read .
And most importantly : enjoy the process !
The important thing is n’t a destination — a perfect , simple life — but the journey along the way .
Manifest plainness ,
Embrace simplicity ,
Reduce selfishness ,
Have few desires .
– Lao-tzu

Maybe we ’ve found our new logo for FOX and all Republicans .
FOX , as part of its ongoing work on behalf of the Republican party , is running ads claiming that none of the other networks covered the recent Teabagger protest in Washington , DC .
Of course , they all did , extensively .
Then why would FOX say otherwise ?
We really need a phrase to describe the conservative trick of accusing you of what they do .
E.g. , we ’re playing the race card when we call them on their racism .
Or , gay people are intolerant ( or intolerance ) when we expose religious right bigotry .
Or , when the Republicans accuse Obama of being mean and partisan .
Or , CNN , MSNBC , CBS and ABC are biased .
In essence , they ’re accusing us of what they are .
But it ’s more than that .
They ’re trying to get us to back off because we ’re getting too close to their dirty little secret .
Republicans are afraid that we ’ll tag them as racists , as bigots , as mean and partisan .
So by accusing us of it first they hope to scare us off , and pollute the waters enough that if and when we do call them on their bs , they ’ll have already accused us of the same thing so hopefully , from their perspective , the public will think both sides are simply name - calling .
CNN ’s Rick Sanchez explain to FOX that “ real ” news networks do n’t promote political events , they cover them .
Magazine publishers are beginning to experiment with new technologies
The first - ever video advertisement will be published in a traditional paper magazine in September .
The video - in - print ads will appear in select copies of the US show business title Entertainment Weekly .
The slim - line screens - around the size of a mobile phone display - also have rechargeable batteries .
The chip technology used to store the video - described as similar to that used in singing greeting cards - is activated when the page is turned .
Each chip can hold up to 40 minutes of video .
The first clips will preview programmes from US TV network CBS and show adverts by the drinks company Pepsi .
VIDEO TECHNOLOGY
Screen uses liquid crystal display ( LCD ) technology Each is 2.7 mm thick with 320x240 resolution Can store 40 mins of video Battery can be recharged via mini-USB Rechargeable battery lasts up to 70 mins Developed by LA - firm Americhip
They will appear in 18 September editions of the magazine distributed in Los Angeles and New York .
It 's believed the new technology will cost much more than normal print ads .
However , BBC correspondent Rajesh Mirchandani said that in an increasingly competitive market , advertisers have realised that it is more important than ever to create attention for their product .
He likened the technology to the Daily Prophet - a newspaper with moving pictures described in the Harry Potter books .
It is not the first time that publishers have experimented with digital technology in magazines .
Last year , for example , men 's lifestyle magazine Esquire published the first using e-ink technology , with a cover that flashed in alternating patterns .
E-ink is the technology used in the Sony Reader and Amazon Kindle electronic books .
Americhip , the developer of video - in - print , has also created magazine technology that appeals to various senses , including smell .

A polymer system based on weak , reversible bonds that can heal itself when heated has been created by UK and US chemists .
The new polymers could be further developed and used in the aerospace and other industries , say the researchers .
The team designed a polymeric structure which holds together using aromatic electronic interactions and can easily repair damage to itself when heated to a modest temperature .
Previous self - healing polymers have relied on stronger interactions and often require additives to facilitate the healing process .
Researcher Wayne Hayes from the University of Reading says that the project was ’a deliberate effort to design polymers which behave in this way , with reversible assembly characteristics . ’
The system uses two polymers , one larger than the other .
The larger polymer naturally folds itself up to maximise attractive interactions , leaving tweezer - shaped electron - deficient receptor units .
A smaller , linear polymer with an aromatic end group inserts into the folds of the larger polymer , forming interactions known as
stacking .
’ The faces of the aromatic components stack together to form relatively weakly bonded systems , but if you introduce enough of them overall you build up a significant interaction , ’ says fellow Reading researcher , Howard Colquhoun .
At room temperature , the polymer mix forms a flexible , self - supporting material .
When the temperature is raised , the interactions holding the structure together are weakened , which allows the polymers to flow into the damaged area .
In one experiment , the team found that a broken film could be re-healed by simply pressing the broken ends gently together and heating briefly at 80?C .
The team suspect the smaller polymer acts as a plasticiser or solvent for the larger polymer , allowing the mix to flow as a liquid .
’ We are trying to achieve something that behaves a little bit like a metal - when it melts it flows very easily , ’ says Colquhoun .
When the mix is cooled the interactions reform and the original appearance and strength of the material is regained , a change that can be seen by observing the colour of the material , says Colquhoun .
At room temperature the material has a blood red colour as a result of the aromatic stacking .
The colour is lost when the material is heated to 60 - 65?C , indicating the material has a lower viscosity .
When cooled , the red colour returns .
Terence Cosgrove , from the colloid group at the University of Bristol , was impressed with the novelty of the approach , saying that it is ’an intriguing prospect ’ to use
stacking in this way .
Meanwhile , Colquhoun says the group will continue to develop these materials , aiming to increase the density of the
stacking to increase the material ’s strength , and perhaps adding additional non-covalent forces other thanstacking .
’ Though we are nowhere near the mechanical properties of conventional materials of , for example , carbon fibre composites , we see this material as a starting point , ’ he says .

Last week 's allegations in a Swedish newspaper sparked an inferno in diplomatic circles , the flames of which are being fanned higher with every passing day .
Despite dealing specifically with the behaviour of Israeli troops in the West Bank , rather than being a broad - stroked attack against Judaism , the indictment against the Israeli army has been held up as a shining example of modern - day " blood libel " , as though the forces of antisemitic darkness are amassing once more against the Jewish people in their entirety .
Aftonbladet presented allegations that Israeli soldiers routinely harvested organs from dead Palestinians in their custody , establishing a link between the organ - theft allegations and the recent money - laundering scandal involving prominent members of the American Jewish community .
The article was immediately condemned throughout the Israeli political and press arenas , with the deputy foreign minister decrying it as a " blood libel against Jews " , and demanding that Swedish officials take action to rebuke the newspaper involved .
Sweden 's response was to fall back on principles of freedom of speech .
While the Swedish ambassador to Israel expressed her dismay at the publication of the accusations , prime minister Fredrik Reinfeldt told a Swedish news agency : " No one can demand that the Swedish government violate its own constitution .
Freedom of speech is an indispensable part of Swedish society . "
Meanwhile , calls for heads to roll in Sweden still emanate from innumerable voices in the Israeli camp , from politicians to press to public .
Feelings are running high now that the spat has turned into a full - blown diplomatic battle .
On reading the original story , it is clear that the article 's content is journalism of the worst kind : based on the flimsiest of evidence , making tenuous connections on little more than pure conjecture and relying on dubious testimony in the absence of hard fact and proof .
However , bad journalism does not automatically an antisemite make , especially when the allegations were directed at the Israeli army , rather than at Judaism and its practices .
Had the article claimed that Jewish teaching encouraged the killing of gentile children and the use of their blood for ritual purposes – the classic definition of blood libel , and the origin of the phrase – it would be another matter , but in this case the accusations are clearly made against a subsection of Israeli society , not against Israelis per se , let alone the worldwide Jewish community .
While pro-Israel commentators routinely allege that criticism of Israel is in fact thinly disguised antisemitism , successive Israeli governments are themselves guilty of harnessing the state of Israel to the wagon of world Jewry , thanks to their public declarations and actions .
By setting Israel up as the Jewish state and claiming to be acting in the name of every Jew on earth , it is little wonder that some critics believe the hype and conflate Israeli policy with Jewish mandates and teachings .
There is no excuse for antisemitism , but there is likewise no excuse for stifling any criticism of Israel under a suffocating cloak of accusations of Jew - hatred .
Allegations against the armies of sovereign states are commonplace among media outlets across the globe : some are exposed as lies , in other cases the claims have been found to based on solid ground .
Either way , Israel 's demand to be treated as any other country means that the machinations of its military , political and other public institutions are fair game for scrutiny , and any charges levelled against them should be responded to in a level - headed and proper fashion .
When the Daily Mirror published faked torture photos purportedly showing abuse of Iraqi detainees , the Ministry of Defence did n't brand the pictures as proof of a conspiracy against Christians , but rather went through the motions of disproving the claims , and achieving their goal of a retraction of the original story .
On the other hand , when Israel was erroneously accused of carrying out a massacre in Jenin , officials span the accusations as a racist attack on Israel , as though any slight against the Israeli army should be treated as nothing more than a bubbling to the fore of medieval antisemitism in its basest form .
Given the paucity of hard facts provided in the Aftonbladet report and its author 's shortcomings when it comes to adhering to journalistic standards , the story is in all likelihood a complete fabrication , and the Israeli authorities ought to be able to easily prove the army 's innocence .
At the same time , that the incident has been blown out of all proportion and engulfed politicians both in Israel and Sweden does not bode well for future similar occurrences .
Israel has to start dealing with criticism in a measured and mature fashion , otherwise it simply plays into the hands of its detractors , who use occasions like this as evidence that Israel 's favourite line of defence is simply crying wolf and running for the hills .
How to talk to complete idiots /
Three basic options .
Choose wisely , lest you go totally insane
There are three basic ways to talk to complete idiots .
The first is to assail them with facts , truths , scientific data , the commonsensical obviousness of it all .
You do this in the very reasonable expectation that it will nudge them away from the ledge of their more ridiculous and paranoid misconceptions because , well , they 're facts , after all , and who can dispute those ?
Why , idiots can , that 's who .
It is exactly this sort of logical , levelheaded appeal to reason and mental acuity that 's doomed to fail , simply because in the idiotosphere , facts are lies and truth is always dubious , whereas hysteria and alarmism resulting in mysterious undercarriage rashes are the only things to be relied upon .
Examples ?
Endless .
You may , for instance , attempt to explain evolution to an extreme fundamentalist Christian .
You may offer up carbon dating , the fossil record , glaciers , any one of 10,000 irrefutable proofs .
You may even dare to talk about the Bible as the clever , completely manufactured , man -made piece of heavily politicized , massively edited , literary myth - making it so very much is , using all sorts of sound academic evidence and historical record .
You are , of course , insane beyond belief to try this , but sometimes you just can't help it .
To the educated mind , it seems inconceivable that millions of people will choose rabid ignorance and childish fantasy over , say , a polar bear .
Permafrost .
Rocks .
Nag Hammadi .
But they will , and they do .
Faced with this mountain of factual obviousness , the bewildered fundamentalist will merely leap back as if you just jabbed him with a flaming homosexual cattle prod , and then fall into a swoon about how neat it is that angels can fly .
But it 's not just the fundamentalists .
This Rule of Idiocy also explains why , when you show certain jumpy , conservative Americans the irrefutable facts about , say , skyrocketing health care costs that are draining their bank accounts , and then show how Obama 's rather modest overhaul is meant to save members of all ages and genders and party affiliations a significant amount of money while providing basic insurance for their family , they , too , will scream and kick like a child made to eat a single bite of broccoli .
Remember , facts do not matter .
The actual Obama plan itself does not matter .
Fear of change , fear of the " Other , " fear of the scary black socialist president , fear that yet another important shift is taking place that they cannot understand and which therefore makes them thrash around like a trapped animal ?
This is all that matters .
This is why , even when you whip out , say , a fresh article by the goodly old Washington Post -- not exactly a bastion of lopsided liberalthink -- one that breaks down the rather brutal truth about the real cost of health care in this country , it will likely be hurled back in your face as an obvious piece of liberal propaganda .
Go ahead , try it .
Or better yet , do n't .
Option two is to try to speak their language , dumb yourself down , engage on the idiot 's level as you try to figure out how their minds work -- or more accurately , do n't work -- so you can better empathize and find a shred of common ground and maybe , just maybe , inch the human experiment forward .
This is , as you already sense , a dangerous trap , pure intellectual quicksand .
It almost never works , and just makes you feel gross and slimy .
Nevertheless , plenty of shrewd political strategists believe that the best way for Obama and the Dems to get their message across regarding everything from health care reform to new environmental regulation , would be to steal a page from the Glenn Beck / Karl Rove / sociopath 's playbook , and start getting stupid .
It 's all about the bogus catchphrases , the sound bites , the emotional punches - to - the - gut .
Death panels !
Rationing !
Fetus farms !
Puppy shredders !
Commie medicine !
Gay apocalypse !
Forced vaccinations !
Exposed nipples during prime - time !
Let one of these inane , completely wrong but oh - so - haunting verbal ticks bite into the below - average American brainstem , and watch your cause bleed all over the headlines .
The big snag here is that the Dems , unlike the Republican Party , are n't really beholden to a radical , mal - educated base of fundamentalist crazies to keep them afloat .
Truly , the political success of the liberal agenda does not depend on the irrational , Bible - crazed " value voter " who 's terrified of gays , believes astronomy is a hoax and thinks Jesus spoke perfect English and really liked giving hugs .
In other words , there really is little point in the liberals adopting this strategy , save for the fact that the major media eats it up and it might serve to counterbalance some of the more ridiculous conservative catchphrases .
What 's more , it could also give the whiny , bickering Dems something slightly cohesive to rally around -- because the truth is , the Democratic Party is n't all that bright , either .
And now we come to option three , easily the finest and most successful approach of all .
Alas , it also remains the most difficult to pull off .
No one is exactly sure why .
The absolute best way to speak to complete idiots is , of course , not to speak to them at all .
That is , you work around them , ignore them completely , disregard the rants and the spittle and the misspelled protest signs and the fervent prayers for apocalypse on Fox News .
Complete refusal to take the fringe nutballs even the slightest bit seriously is the only way to make true progress .
This also happens to be the invaluable advice of one Frank Schaeffer , noted author and a former fundamentalist nutball himself , who made a simply superb appearance on Rachel Maddow 's show recently , wherein he offered up one of the most articulate , fantastic takedowns of the fundamentalist idiot 's mindset in recent history .
It 's a must - watch .
Do it .
Do it now .
Now , you may argue that , while Schaeffer may be dead right and also rather deserving of being quoted far and wide , it 's also true that calling people stupid is no way to advance the debate , and is itself rather childish and stupid .
And you 'd be absolutely right .
But you 'd also be missing the point .
When you ignore the idiots completely , you are not calling them anything at all .
You are not trying to advance any sort of argument , because there is no debate taking place .
You are simply bypassing the giant pothole of ignorance entirely .
You are not kowtowing to the least educated of your voting bloc , like the GOP is so desparetely fond of doing .
You are not trying to give the idiotosphere equal weight in the discussion .
As Schaeffer says , " You can not reorganize village life to suit the village idiot . "
By employing option three , you are doing the only humane thing left to do : you are letting the idiotosphere eat itself alive .
Do it for the children , wo n't you ?

You Can Dropship
A dropshipped online store is a type of ecommerce business where you you take orders on your own website , but your vendor or distributor is responsible for shipping the product to the end customer .
As a result , you do n’t have to carry any inventory at all .
You simply act as a middle man between the distributor and the buyer .
Here ’s how it works .
A customer finds your website online and places an order

You receive the money from the customer and immediately place an order with your distributor at an agreed upon wholesale price .

You Can Use A 3PL
For those of you who are unfamiliar with the terminology , a 3 PL is a 3rd party logistics company .
Most 3 PL services can handle the storage of your products in addition to order fulfillment .
And in some cases , they can even help with customer support and product returns .
Here ’s what a typical order flow looks like if you use a 3PL
You ship all of your products to the 3PL provider

Overall , if you want to start a more traditional online store but do n’t want to worry about inventory or fulfillment , then using a 3 PL might be a good option for you .
Here ’s a list of 3 PLs to consider if you decide to go this route along with what to look for in a good logistics partner .
ShipWire.com – Probably the easiest way to get started .
However , they will not take any special packaging requirements .
Basically a no frills fulfillment service .
EFulfillmentService.com – A no frills fulfillment house that caters to small businesses .
They do n’t need for you to have a corp or LLC in the United States .
Generally easy to work with .
ShipMyOrders.com – A fulfillment service very similar to EFulfillmentService.com .
They cater to small businesses .
There is no minimum on monthly transactions

InFifthGear.com > 300 packages / month –
These guys can take on high touch products .
For example , they can do personalization , engraving etc …
But they generally are only interested in shops that can generate at least 300 orders / month .
3plsolutions.co.uk –
An option for those shipping in the UK
Direct -Outbound.com – A fulfillment service catering to small - large businesses .
At Last –
These guys tend to cater to larger shops but you might still want to talk with them .
AliveFulfillment.com – Integrates nicely with Shopify
Quick Tip : Amazon is also a 3 PL .
If you are already selling on Amazon using FBA , you can also have Amazon fulfill the orders from your own website .
The only downside is that your goods will be shipped in an Amazon branded box unless you pay an extra fee .
You Can Use Amazon FBA
Right now , Amazon FBA is the most popular choice among online sellers .
Amazon FBA stands for “ Fulfillment By Amazon ” and here ’s how it works .
You ship your goods to Amazon ’s warehouse
to Amazon ’s warehouse
You list your products on the Amazon marketplace
on the Amazon marketplace A customer places an order on Amazon
an order on Amazon Amazon handles storage , fulfillment and all of your customer support
Going the Amazon FBA route is extremely attractive because not only does Amazon take care of EVERYTHING , but you also have access to Amazon ’s vast audience of buyers .
However the main downside is that you have to obey Amazon ’s rules and they also take a pretty sizable chunk of your profits .
In addition , it ’s much harder to establish your brand on Amazon because people think that they are buying from Amazon and not you .
Overall , here are the pros and cons
The Pros
Once you ship your products to Amazon , you do n’t have to do anything else .
Amazon takes care of sales , shipping , returns and customer service
to Amazon , you do n’t have to do anything else .
Amazon takes care of sales , shipping , returns and customer service Amazon ’s marketplace is so large that you will likely generate sales right away
The Cons
Amazon takes a sizeable chunk of your sales .
( 15 % of your revenues + 10 - 15 % for fulfillment depending on your product )
( 15 % of your revenues + 10 - 15 % for fulfillment depending on your product )
You have to purchase your products upfront
your products upfront
Your margins must be high to make money because Amazon takes such a large chunk of your sales .
( Margins should be > 66 % which means you will likely need to import from overseas ) .

You only get paid every month .

You have to constantly monitor your listings from the competition
your listings from the competition Amazon can ban you at any time
at any time
It ’s hard to establish your brand because you are building your house on someone else ’s property
The Amazon marketplace is so large that you definitely should be selling on Amazon at some point .
In fact , I ’ve had students make over 100 K per month selling on Amazon alone .
But selling on Amazon can also be extremely stressful as well .
Because the Amazon platform is super competitive , you have to constantly monitor your products in case they get piggybacked or hijacked
In addition , there ’s also the danger of getting inexplicably banned or shut down in case you get too many customer complaints .
My Recommendations
Most people ’s first instinct is to gravitate towards dropshipping since it ’s cheap and risk free .
But in this day and age , dropshipping is getting harder and harder to execute successfully .
Because you are selling someone else ’s products at a lower margin , you usually can’t win based on price .
Instead , you have to do an incredible job of educating your customer and presenting them with an amazing shopping experience to get them to buy from you .
For a great example of a successful dropshipped store , check out my buddy Andrew ’s shop at Right Channel Radios
In terms of deciding whether to sell on Amazon versus using a separate 3PL , I heavily lean towards selling on Amazon through FBA and also using them as your 3PL .
If you are worried about Amazon ’s branding on the box , then pay the extra fee to have it removed .
Chances are , you are going to be selling on Amazon anyway , so there ’s no reason to use 2 separate fulfillment services that do the same thing .
In my mind , the only reason to use a separate 3 PL is if you require special handling on your products .
For example , smaller mom and pop 3 PLs may be willing to bundle separate products together or prepare your products in a specific way that Amazon would not .
If you sell internationally , certain 3 PLs may be better equipped to handle international fulfillment .
And finally , certain 3 PLs may also offer more attractive pricing than Amazon depending on your goods .
But no matter what option you go with , your end goal should be to create your own branded business .
So even if you are seeing great results on Amazon , you should always start your own website .
In this day and age , you do n’t ever need to carry inventory or worry about fulfillment but you still need a brand .
Good luck !

�dgar Garc�a hab �a participado en una balacera el domingo y result� herido .
Cuando era trasladado hacia Morelia , un comando lo mat� en un ataque con granadas y disparos
Uruapan , Michoac�n | Viernes 19 de junio de 2009
Rafael Rivera Mill�n / Corresponsal | El Universal

Un comando remat� a un presunto pistolero herido cuando era trasladado en ambulancia hacia un hospital de Morelia .
Los hechos ocurrieron a las 02:00 horas en la carretera que va de Uruapan a Morelia .
El grupo armado intercept� el veh�culo en el que viajaba �dgar Garc�a Trinidad , 23 a�os , quien era acompa�ado por su esposa Aid� Vanesa Segura D�az , de 20 a�os , y param�dicos .
Los sicarios atacaron la unidad con granadas de fragmentaci�n , adem�s de realizar disparos , que remataron al herido y dejaron gravemente lesionada a la mujer , seg�n reportes de la Polic�a municiapal y la Suprocuraduar�a Regional de Justicia .
Los param�dicos de la ambulancia resultaron ilesos , pues al ser detenida la ambulancia a la salida de Uruapan en la carretera a Morelia , descendieron de la ambulancia y lograron ponerse a salvo .
Garc�a Trinidad era originario de Naucalpan , Estado de M�xico , y estaba hospitalizado en el nosocomio de Uruapan desde el pasado domingo , pues result� herido luego de que atacara , junto con otros hombres armados , una " casa de seguridad " en la zona .
Durante la balacera result� herido y fue trasladado al hospital , pero por la gravedad de sus heridas fue trasladado hacia Morelia para recibir atenci�n m�dica especializado , pero en el viaje fue asesinado .

Population control the solution to climate change A week after the Royal Society published its musings on technological solutions that might curb climate change , another organisation has come up with what it believes is the cheapest and most effective way to tackle emissions - contraception .
Optimum Population Trust , an environmental charity and think tank , claims that family planning is almost five times cheaper than existing green technologies when it comes to combating climate change .
A report from the London School of Economics commissioned by the trust claims that for every £ 4 spent on family planning over the next 40 years would cut carbon dioxide emissions by more than a tonne .
Achieving the same result with current low carbon technologies would , says the report , cost at least £ 19 .
Fewer Emitters , Lower Emissions , Less Cost concludes that " considered purely as a method of reducing future CO2 emissions " , family planning is more cost - effective than leading low - carbon technologies .
It does not advocate forced birth control , but does point out that UN figures suggest that 40 % of pregnancies worldwide are not planned .
Roger Martin , chair of OPT , said the report highlights the need to include population in the broader climate change debate .
" It 's always been obvious that total emissions depend on the number of emitters as well as their individual emissions - the carbon tonnage can't shoot down , as we want , while the population keeps shooting up , " he said .
" The taboo on mentioning this fact has made the whole climate change debate so far somewhat unreal .
" Stabilising population levels has always been essential ecologically , and this study shows it 's economically sensible too .
" The population issue must now be added into the negotiations for the Copenhagen climate change summit in December .
" This part of the solution is so easy , and so cheap , and would bring so many other social and economic benefits , from health and education to the empowerment of women .
" It would also ease all the other environmental problems we face - the rapid shrinkage of soil , fresh water , forests , fisheries , wildlife and oil reserves and the looming food crisis . "

The site is the largest of Amazon 's four UK centres
A contractor is in hospital after falling through four floors at Swansea warehouse of online retailer Amazon .
The man had fallen through floorboards on the fourth floor and continued to fall through flooring until he landed on the ground floor .
The warehouse , which opened in 2008 , covers an area the size of 10 football pitches and is the company 's largest UK distribution centre .
Police said the Heath and Safety Executive was investigating .
The ambulance service confirmed that the man was taken to Morriston Hospital shortly after 1230 BST on Wednesday and that his injuries were not life - threatening .
An Amazon spokesman said : " An incident occurred earlier today ( Wednesday ) , whilst work was being undertaken by external specialist contractors to construct additional product storage capacity at our fulfilment centre .
" A worker employed by the contractor suffered injuries and was taken to hospital .
" We are working with the contactor to ensure that the incident is fully investigated . "
Mr. Leisinger said in a telephone interview that the pieces were probably composed in 1763 or 1764 , when Mozart was 7 or 8 .
If truly by him , they would serve as an important link between his simple earliest compositions and his first major works , Mr. Leisinger said .

Neal Zaslaw , a Cornell University music professor and Mozart expert who was not involved in the discovery , said the attribution to young Wolfgang was “ highly plausible , ” although it was not likely that it could be proved “ beyond a reasonable doubt . ”
Called “ Nannerl ’s Music Book , ” the manuscript volume containing the pieces has long been known and studied .
It has been in the Mozarteum since 1864 .
Mr. Leisinger said that preparation of a facsimile edition by the Mozarteum prompted him to examine the pieces more closely and ultimately led to his deduction .
He said that the concerto part and the prelude were musically and technically related .
Leopold used the music notebook to give Nannerl , as his daughter Maria Anna was called , keyboard lessons .
It contains some 60 pieces , many by contemporary composers and 18 recognized as by Mozart .
Most of those are in Leopold ’s handwriting , composed before Wolfgang had a firm grasp of writing out music , Mr. Leisinger said .
After Mozart ’s death , Nannerl ripped out pages with his handwriting and gave them away to friends and Mozart admirers .
The two newly examined pieces were written hastily , with corrections , evidence that Leopold was not copying out somebody else ’s work .
At the same time the nature of the music departs from the compositions Leopold himself was producing .
Instead the concerto movement , labeled Molto Allegro , contains a multitude of notes and technically demanding , sometimes awkward , passages .

If you often feel lonely , even when you are surrounded by other people , do n’t give up hope !
If you feel more lonely in crowds , spend more time socializing in more intimate groups with people you know well .
Try asking people about themselves , like where they grew up or what they do for a living , to quickly find people with common interests .
If you are a shy person , master the art of conversation with lots of practice .
On the other hand , if you feel drained by talking and entertaining people , try connecting with others by listening more and talking less .

The following statement has been posted on the Mayo Clinic Health Policy Blog site :
Mayo Clinic strongly supports President Obama ’s call for health insurance reform and health care delivery reform , and agrees with the President ’s position that the status quo is not acceptable .
We believe that a bipartisan , collaborative approach is essential to achieving significant , patient - centered health care reform .
Mayo Clinic and the many organizations and individuals working with us in the Mayo Clinic Health Policy Center are strongly in favor of reform of both health care delivery and health insurance .
True health care reform is getting better results for the money spent .
Better results for money spent is what we meant by high value health care : better outcomes , safer care , better service and at lower costs over time .
And this will translate to better access to medical services for all Americans .
We agree with President Obama ’s focus on insuring all Americans and reforming the health care payment system .
Henry Paulson , then the Treasury secretary , in his office last September , the month Lehman fell and the bailout took shape .
By Nigel Parry / CPi Syndication .
It was February 2008 , and Henry M. Paulson Jr. , a prince of Wall Street turned secretary of the Treasury , was reflecting on his biggest achievement to date : a $ 168 billion economic - stimulus package that had passed Congress four days earlier after swift , bipartisan prog ress through both houses .
In light of all the later twists and turns that the global financial system and the national economy took , this measure would come to seem quaint and fainthearted .
But at the time , it was a very big deal indeed , and Paulson felt justifiably proud .
The stimulus had been his baby .
Paulson had persuaded George W. Bush , whose relations with both parties in Congress were by then close to toxic , to articulate only the broadest principles , and not to present a detailed plan .
Paulson himself , in endless night and weekend negotiations with congressional leaders , had delivered the final package .
“ Nancy Pelosi to me was a wonder in this deal , and she was available 24 - 7 , anytime I called her on the cell phone , ” Paulson told me , his hulking frame unfolding in a comfortable chair in his office at the Treasury , dominated by an oil portrait of his first pred e ces sor , Alexander Hamilton .
“ She was engaged , she was decisive , and she was really willing to just get involved with all of her people on a hands - on basis . ”
Paulson paused .
“ Now let me … I ’ll be there in one minute … Let me just make a … I have been , you know … I finished this thing on Thursday night , flew over to Tokyo , flew back , and I ’m battling a bit of a stomach problem . ”

How to Perform an EMERGENCY Baptism ! - 08-17-2008 , 01:40 PM
08-17-2008 , 01:40 PM
a proper baptism performed by a pastor , but there are times when an Emergency Baptism is needed and in these cases HE may call upon a layperson to perform an Emergency Baptism .
When an Emergency Baptism called for :
The candidate urgently requests baptism .
Despite having received the best available medical attention , the candidate is reasonably worried that they might die .
You have tried and failed to contact a member of the clergy , or a member of the clergy cannot arrive in time .
Performing a Emergency Baptism :
Make sure your intentions are to perform a baptism , what I mean is make sure you are n't interrogating a witch , horsing around in a swimming pool , or looking for a stringer full of Largemouth Bass that your hubby dropped in the lake .
Water must be involved , so locate a pool of water .
Avoid those funny round cement structures with an arm that goes around in circles spraying water !
Immerse the person to be baptised and recite Matthew 28:19 ; “ I baptize you in the Name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit . ”
Finally , if this person is an accident victim , or appears to be unconscious or worse , remember to call 911 after the baptism .
A few final thoughts :
Many folks live their entire lives without performing an Emergency Baptism .
Do n't be too eager to offer such a service .
It is not uncommon for a person who is being stoned to beg for baptism , but this is usually just a ploy to avoid the suffering they deserve .
Be absolutely sure that the person requesting an Emergency Baptism is truly repentant .
Jesus prefersperformed by a pastor , but there are times when an Emergency Baptism is needed and in these cases HE may call upon a layperson to perform an Emergency Baptism .

Conservatives have been working like mad to whitewash out of public view the existence of violent right - wing extremists , only to run into one problem :
They keep popping back up again , time after time .
Darned reality intrudes again .
So when the Southern Poverty Law Center recently confirmed what we 've been reporting at C&L for awhile now -- that the far - right " militia " movement of the 1990s was roaring back to life -- it really was n't a big surprise when Fox ran a story quoting a bunch of various right - wing officials dismissing it :
" I think it 's utter nonsense to say it 's racial , " said Carter Clews , spokesman at Americans for Limited Government .
Clews said Obama 's " doctrinaire socialistic approach to government " has triggered a populist backlash , but " it 's inappropriate to use the word militia . "
The SPLC report came just four months after the Department of Homeland Security issued a controversial report on " right - wing extremists . "
That assessment carried many of the same themes and warnings as the new " militia " report , also warning that the election of the first black president could be exploited as a recruiting tool .
According to data ALG obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request , the DHS relied in large part on news articles , questionable Web sites and several already - public SPLC reports -- not official government sources -- in writing its " right - wing extremists " report .
William Gheen , president of Americans for Legal Immigration PAC , said the latest SPLC report suggests that DHS and the law center are relying largely on the same pool of information to make their claims about the rise in right - wing extremism .
" They are attempting to brand all right - of - center protesters as potential domestic terrorists or extremists , " he said .
" They are painting whole swaths of people as hate groups and extremists . "
This is , of course , pure bunk of a sort :
The report specifies that the key to considering someone under the influence of the Patriot movement is their willing adoption of the various conspiracy theories and provably false " facts " that form the bedrock of the movement 's belief systems .
Things like , for instance , believing Obama is actually a non-citizen born in Kenya .
So to the extent that the SPLC is branding " whole swaths " of people , that 's only true as far as these kinds of far - right beliefs spread .
Unfortunately , as we 've seen with the adoption of " birther " beliefs by nearly half of all Republicans , that now includes a much broader swath of society than we'd heretofore suspected .
But that is not the SPLC 's fault .
Rather , all that point raises is serious questions about the direction that movement conservatism is now taking .
After all , all those Obama - hating crazies are not coming out of the woodwork in a vacuum .
Earlier this week , Keith Olbermann explored this in depth with the SPLC's Mark Potok .
It 's an enlightening discussion .
Bruce Springsteen took to the streets - well , his website - in February and threatened that Ticketmaster and LiveNation combining to form one ticketing system would lead to a " near monopoly . "
Bruce 's cause earned a victory this week when the chairman of the Senate 's antitrust committee asked Christine Varney , assistant AG of the Antitrust Division , to investigate the Tickemaster / LiveNation $ 2.5 billion merger , saying it would " combine two entertainment powerhouses and will transform the concert business " and requires " thorough scrutiny . "
Ticketmaster is " the nation 's dominant primary ticket seller " and LiveNation is the " nation 's largest concert promoter , " the letter to Varney said .
An investigation would be another high - profile move by Varney , who made clear there would be increased antitrust scrutiny on her watch .
The antitrust division has already made news with investigations into the Google books settlement and phone companies .
Varney does not appear to have free reign , however .
As The New York Times reported Sunday , some Democratic lawmakers are concerned aggressive antitrust scrutiny will hurt ties they have tried to forge with the business community .
Further , some in the Obama adminstration think a recession is not the time for an antitrust crackdown .
The Ticketmaster / LiveNation investigation , if opened , might be a good one to watch .
It is a relatively focused area with very few main players and a not overly - complicated structure .
Anyone who buys concert tickets knows that a $ 50 ticket ( to the extent one still exists ) ends up being closer to $ 75 once you pay the ticket company 's fees .
Being a direct cause of annoyance in millions of concertgoers ' lives may make it difficult for Ticketmaster and LiveNation to find a lot of friends in this battle .
Jamie Waylett plays Draco Malfoy 's right - hand man in the Potter films
A Harry Potter actor has admitted growing cannabis in his mother 's north - west London home .
Jamie Waylett , 19 , who plays bully Vincent Crabbe in the film series , pleaded guilty to growing 10 cannabis plants in tents at the Kilburn house .
The court heard police found shots of the plants on Mr Waylett 's camera after he was arrested for taking a picture of officers as he and a friend drove past .
He is due to re-appear before City of Westminster magistrates on 21 July .
At the moment I 'm not giving you any promises as to how the court will deal with this case
Chief magistrate Timothy Workman
The images found on the camera led police to search Mr Waylett 's mother 's home where they found the 10 cannabis plants .
Officers had previously searched the car belonging to his friend , John Innis , 20 .
There they discovered a knife and eight bags of cannabis , and later found another three bags of cannabis in Mr Innis 's possession .
During the hearing , Mr Innis , from Barnet , north London , admitted possession of a knife and having 11 bags of cannabis .
' Music compilation '
Chief magistrate Timothy Workman said : " Clearly the possession of cannabis is a serious matter and indeed the possession of knives is serious as well .
" At the moment I 'm not giving you any promises as to how the court will deal with this case ( on 21 July ) . "
Defending , Cheryl Rudden said Waylett had been videoing the road side for a music compilation when he caught the attention of officers .
Ms Rudden told the court : " There are possibly issues as to his future in his field so far . "
Mr Waylett played a sidekick of villain Draco Malfoy in the Harry Potter films .
The latest instalment in the series , Harry Potter and the Half - Blood Prince , went on general release on Wednesday .
A recent survey from internet security consultancy , Cryptohippie , suggests that the UK is setting the pace in at least one area - though being classified as the West ’s most repressive regime when it comes to electronic surveillance might not be a title that this government is entirely happy to wear .
This result emerges from Cryptohippie ’s recently published Electronic Police State 2008 ( pdf ) .
This is the first in what are intended to be a series of annual reports that will audit the " State use of electronic technologies to record , organize , search and distribute forensic evidence against its citizens " .
The audit focusses on 17 factors , ranging from requirement to produce documents on demand , through to the extent to which states force ISP ’s and phone companies to retain data , the blurring of boundaries between police and intelligence work and ultimately the breakdown of the principles of habeas corpus .
A simple five - point scoring system is used for each factor , with results totalled to produce an overall score .
Some 52 major states are looked at , with final ranking apparently influenced by two quite different factors .
On the one hand , states that are simply repressive are likely to score highly – and they do .
The top four places in the survey are occupied by China , North Korea , Belarus and Russia .
However , electronic policing also requires some degree of technological sophistication – so it is not surprising to find the UK dropping in at no .
5 and the US at no .
6 . France and Germany arrive a few places below that .
This result echoes warnings issued repeatedly by Lords and the Information Commissioner – most recently in an official report last month – that Britain is slowly sleepwalking toward becoming a surveillance society .
Equally predictable was the government response that it takes all such criticisms seriously and needs to strike a balance .
However , as both Cryptohippie and other government critics have argued , the government response is disingenuous , relying on a rejection of straw men , rather than engaging with genuine fears .
The report expands on its subject thus : " The usual image of a " police state " includes secret police dragging people out of their homes at night , with scenes out of Nazi Germany or Stalin ’s USSR .
The problem with these images is that they are horribly outdated .
That ’s how things worked during your grandfather ’s war – that is not how things work now .
" An electronic police state is quiet , even unseen .
All of its legal actions are supported by abundant evidence .
It looks pristine . " ®

INTRODUCTION
The process of discernment is common to contemplative and mindful meditation practices .
To discern is to recognize and label the ending of one thing with the beginning of another .
All wisdom and knowledge is dependent on some form of discernment .
Without this mental faculty , life could only be known as One single thing , and although this perception of reality might lead one to great insight , it is n’t very productive when we are called upon to act intently , which is practically every conscious moment of our waking life .
In order to act , we must distinguish between objects and learn to value some over others .
Without this , action could only be arbitrary and meaningless .
While meditating we discern between different stimuli – a sound of a car in the distance , the smell of food cooking , or the bubbling sensation of a pain in our lower back .
Through these observations we become more and more familiar with the reality of impermanence : the ever - changing state of conditions in our world .
Even while still and sitting we are the focal point of a wide variety of different experiences that may arise .
One moment we can be attending to an itch on our toe , the next we are dreaming about where and what we will eat for dinner .
Mindfulness meditation teaches us to be better aware of when these changes in consciousness occur .
MEDITATING ON NEW BEGINNINGS
Even in the comfort of our own solitary meditation life remains uncertain .
We never really know where the next moment might bring us .
The unknown can be frightening on one hand , but tremendously powerful in other respects .
The future , especially for our self in our own life , is unpredictable .
At the same time it is in our hands .
In every precious moment we experience the spirit of free will ; the ability to make decisions and perform action with intent and meaning .
It is a type of energy that is inside all of us .
It is the ability to attend to our environments and direct action .
To experience life without building upon this spirit would surely become a mundane existence .
It lives inside all of us .
It is the desire for a meaningful life , much like the Meaningful Life that is discussed in Positive psychologist , ( and former president of the American Psychological Association , Martin Seligman in his 2002 book “ Authentic Happiness . ”
The effect of joint custody on marriage and divorce
Martin Halla
Marriage rates have been falling over the last thirty years and cohabitation has emerged as an important social institution .
A large number of US polices have been designed to increase the incidence of marriage and to stabilise existing marriages .
This column shows that custody law is one such policy – it has had a large positive impact on marriage rates since 1969 .
The American family has undergone radical changes over the last decades .
Marriage rates have been falling over the last thirty years and cohabitation has emerged as an important social institution .
Divorce rates rose sharply starting in the mid-1960s , peaked in the early 1980s , and have been declining since ( Figure 1 ) .
These dramatic demographic changes accompanied increased economic independence of women and radical changes in family law .
Of course , the causal link between demographic , economic , and legal changes is non-trivial .
The economic literature has focused so far on changes in divorce law .
In particular , scholars have studied the impact of the move from mutual consent to unilateral divorce laws and changes in the laws regarding the division of matrimonial property .

The joint custody reform
Custody law has garnered hardly any attention in the literature .
2
The allocation of custody , however , is a crucial aspect of every divorce since it governs the actual post - divorce living arrangements and may have important welfare implications .
Many states have changed their custody law fundamentally since the 1970s .
Traditionally , after divorce one parent ( usually the mother ) was assigned sole custody and exclusively responsible for the child .
The so - called non-custodian parent was restricted to specified visitation rights .
In 1973 , Indiana was the first US state to introduce a law favouring joint custody ( Brinig and Buckley , 1998 ) .
It has since spread to nearly all states .
There are various forms of joint custody .
One typically distinguishes between joint legal custody and joint physical custody .
Joint legal custody means that both parents share the right and the obligation of making major decisions about their child ’s upbringing ( e. g. about schooling , religion , and health care ) .
Joint physical custody means that the child spends a significant amount of time with each parent .
In any case , joint custody shares the rights and obligations concerning the child between divorced parents more equally than sole custody .
There has been an ongoing debate – across academic disciplines including economics , law , psychology and sociology – between proponents and opponents of joint custody .
Proponents typically argue that children benefit from ongoing support and resources from both parents , while opponents object that children under joint custody are exposed to ongoing parental conflict .
The causal relationship between certain custody arrangements and child outcomes is far from clear , and the empirical evidence is mostly inconclusive .
Joint custody and the incentive to marry and to divorce
Even more fundamentally , the introduction of laws permitting joint custody of children after divorce may have an impact on the incidence of marriage and divorce .
The move from sole custody to joint custody may cause a redistribution of the gains from marriage between spouses ( redistribution effect ) .
The party who gains from this redistribution ( supposedly the man ) faces a higher incentive to marry after the reform .
Secondly , the option of joint custody may affect the expected utility in the state of divorce and the expected cost of the divorce process ( cost effects ) .
If joint custody reduces the expected monetary and emotional cost of divorce , the reform may increase the likelihood of divorce .
Finally , joint custody may also affect the spouses ’ behaviour during marriage and change their incentive to make marital - specific investments ( behavioural effect ) .
If it causes an increase in aggregate incentive to invest , we should observe an increase in the value of marriage and a raise in marriage rates .
Higher levels of marital - specific investments should in turn reduce the likelihood of divorce .
There are several potential countervailing effects of joint custody on the incentive to marry and to divorce , and it remains an empirical question if and how joint custody affects marriage and divorce rates .
Empirical evidence
In order to identify the causal effect of joint custody on the incidence of marriage and divorce , we exploit the variation occurring from the different timing of joint custody reforms across the US and the control group of divorcing couples without minors ( for details see Halla 2009 ) .
Difference - in - differences estimates based on state panel data ( from 1969 through 2003 ) show that the introduction of joint custody had no immediate impact on marriage rates , but we find a large and statistically significant increase in the marriage rate starting five years after the introduction of joint custody .
The effect of the joint custody reform grows over time .
Seven to eight years after the reform we observe an effect of 1.64 additional marriages in the treatment states relative to the control states .
The full effect of the reform after fifteen years following the adoption of joint custody is equal to additional 3.68 marriages per 1,000 adults .
3
This delayed and increasing causal effect of the reform is consistent with the gradual dissemination of joint custody awards .
4
In contrast , we find no convincing evidence for an impact of joint custody on divorce rates .
In sum , joint custody had a clear positive impact on the number of married people .
It increased the stock of married people by about 1.5 percentage points and dampened the ongoing decline in marriage rates over the last thirty years .
All of our results are robust to a number of alternative specifications ( e.g. we control for the adoption of unilateral divorce laws . )
The short - side of the marriage market
Given the dominance of maternal custody under sole custody regimes , the introduction of joint custody has plausibly increased the incentive to marry for men , who typically more reluctant to marry .
Consistently , we observe , based on data from the Monitoring the Future survey , that men ’s stated willingness to marry has increased since the 1970s .
Therefore , all our empirical evidence is fully consistent with the supposition that the additional marriages due to joint custody are the result of increased gains of marriage for men .
Layers of selection into joint custody
Our results clarify the different layers of selection that have to be considered when studying the effect of joint custody on post - divorce ( child ) outcomes .
Firstly , our micro-analysis directly shows that couples with joint custody awards are selected .
Secondly , given that joint custody has an impact on the incidence of marriage , additional marriages that would not have occurred under single custody may change the composition of the stock of married couples .
These marginal marriages may be of lower match quality .
In addition , joint custody may have changed the investment in children within and / or outside marriage .
Like the literature on unilateral divorce law , our empirical analysis can be regarded as a test of the Coase Theorem .
Becker , Landes and Michael ( 1977 ) argued that if spouses can bargain efficiently , the Coase theorem implies that a change in divorce law only affects the distribution of welfare within marriage , but not the incidence of marriage or divorce .
Equivalently , under a sole custody regime , the right to spend time with the child after divorce is held individually .
The introduction of joint custody re-assigns this right to being held jointly .
Our results – showing that the incidence of marriage changes – can be interpreted as evidence that spouses may be unable to bargain efficiently over time with the child .
What it means for policy
Finally , our results should be of considerable interest to policymakers .
For varying reasons , the public worries about the decline in marriage , and policymakers seek to increase marriage rates .
A large number of US polices have been designed to increase the incidence of marriage and to stabilise existing marriages .
In the case of joint custody , no attention was given to its potential marriage - promoting effect when it was considered .
Our findings are also a first step in understanding which polices can be used to promote marriage .

1 Most of the papers have studied the effects of these laws on divorce rates ( Peters , 1986 ; Allen , 1992 ; Peters , 1992 ; Friedberg , 1998 ; Wolfers , 2006 ) .
Other outcome variables are marriage ( Rasul , 2006 ; Matouschek and Rasul , 2008 ) , marriage and fertility ( Alesina and Giuliano , 2007 ; Drewianka , 2008 ) , marriage - specific investments ( Stevenson , 2007 ) , female labour supply ( Gray , 1998 ; Genadek , Stock and Stoddard , 2007 ) , various child - outcomes ( Gruber , 2004 ) , and domestic violence and suicide ( Dee , 2003 ; Stevenson and Wolfers , 2006 ) .
2 The only paper that has previously examined the impact of custody law on divorce is Brinig and Buckley ( 1998 ) .
They find a negative effect of the introduction of joint custody laws on divorce rates .
We are not aware of any attempt to study the impact of custody law on marriage rates .
3 The average number of yearly marriages per 1,000 adults is 17.45 in the sample .
4 Based on micro-level information on 179,997 divorce certificates provided by the National Vital Statistics System of the National Center for Health Statistics for the time period from 1989 through 1995 , we show that the probability of a joint custody award increases by three percentage points each year after the introduction of joint custody .

Writing in The State and Revolution in 1917 , Vladimir Lenin summed up the economic aim of socialism as follows : “ To organize the whole economy on the lines of the postal service … . ”
Incredible , is n’t it ?
After centuries of treatises and miles of paper and tubs of ink , this is the great historical turning point : government employees carrying sacks of paper mail from house to house , and operating at an economic loss .
It ’s fascinating how it all comes down to the post office , again and again in the history of public policy .
And so it is in our time , with Obama ’s admission / gaffe / slip concerning the post office and its analogy to what he wants to do with health care .
Here is a transcript of his spontaneous talk at a high school .
A student raised a question about the government ’s provision of health services and its impact on private services .
“ How can a private company compete against the government ?
My answer is that if the private insurance companies are providing a good bargain , and if the public option has to be self - sustaining , meaning that taxpayers are n’t subsidizing it , but it has to run on charging premiums and providing good services , and a good network of doctors , just like private insurers do , then I think private insurers should be able to compete .
“ They do it all the time .
If you think about it , UPS and Fed - Ex are doing just fine .
It ’s the Post Office that ’s always having problems ….
there is nothing inevitable about this somehow destroying the private marketplace .
As long as it is not set up where the government is being subsidized by the taxpayers so that even if they are providing a good deal , we keep having to pony up more and more money . ”
The Left , The Right an ... Llewellyn H. Rockwell Jr Best Price : $ 7.33 Buy New $ 40.00 ( as of 07:55 EST - Details )
Now , these comments are nothing short of incredible .
The Post Office has been on the loser list for many decades .
Most recently , it has been included on the GAO ’s high - risk list , increasing its debt to $ 10.2 billion and incurring a cash shortfall of $ 1 billion .
Note that the post office is not being shut down for this mess .
On the contrary , it is being subsidized not only with tax dollars but , most importantly , with laws .
Title 18 ( I.83.1696 ) says that “ Whoever establishes any private express for the conveyance of letters or packets ” can be fined and jailed .
Moreover , the law ( 39.I.6.606 ) says that any letter delivered by unlawful means can be seized and stolen by the government .
It is immune from antitrust action and criminal liability .
You can read the whole Post Office Gosplan here .
If the Post Office were really a market institution , it would go belly - up in about half an hour .
So , no , there is no competition here .
Only the government is permitted to deliver first - class letters .
How do UPS and Fed - Ex get away with it ?
They slip through a hole in the law by delivering packages , not mail .
And it was n’t easy to survive even then .
Just as in the 19th century when the federal government waged war on Lysander Spooner ’s American Letter Mail Company and on Wells Fargo ( and Benjamin Tucker defended “ private enterprise in the letter - carrying business ” ) , the government has been hounding private services in our time , whether through wicked labor union bullying or by restricting their services as much as possible .
The freedom of UPS and Fed - Ex to operate at all is hard won .
But the government has succeeded in destroying the private marketplace in the one area that government monopolizes by law .
It took the innovation of digital messaging to finally horn in on that area .
And this has worked in a big way , with a massive collapse in the number of people choosing government mails over digital alternatives .
Speaking of Liberty Jr. , Llewellyn H. Rock ...

Therefore Obama is right in a strange way : private enterprise has triumphed and government service is terrible .
Everyone knows this .
It is utterly preposterous that a government mail service exists at all .
There is no theory of economics that supports it .
There is not now nor has there ever been any economic reason for government postal service .
It should be immediately abolished and private enterprise should take over .
Even on the basis of Obama ’s thin and strange statements , you might argue this conclusion .
But perhaps Obama meant to suggest that the reason the Post Office is so bad is because it has to compete with private enterprise .
If he meant that , he lives in a socialist fantasy land , and we have a very dangerous man on our hands .
In the real world , no living person could possibly believe that mail service would be improved by getting rid of the efficient producers and granting a totalitarian monopoly to a single government - backed provider .
How can a private company compete against the government ?
Simply because government is so terrible at what it does that even a private company that is beaten down and attacked and competed against with all the tax dollars in the world will do better than the government .
It is true in mail and it is true in health care .
But what they will not be able to do is thrive to the point of universal service , especially when there are laws that prohibit direct service - by - service competition .
Another point that needs to be addressed is Obama ’s claim that the government service will operate just like the private service , with self - sustaining financing .
But here is the question that socialists have never been able to answer .
If the goal is to get government to operate like a private service , what is the value added by having it provided by the government in the first place ?
The only reason for a government service is precisely to provide financial support for an operation that is otherwise unsustainable , else there would be no point in the government ’s involvement at all .
And let us set aside the amazing and preposterous claim that if the government service does n’t work according to market principles , it will be shut down .
Never in the entire history of government has that been true .
No matter how bad , no matter how financially egregious , no matter how much the people suffer , the propensity is for government services to last forever and ever , precisely because they are protected from market - based tests of profit and loss .
The right path to health - care reform is the market path ( no subsidies , no monopolies such as drug patents , no licensure , no anything ) that tends toward universal distribution at very low prices and relentless improvement in service .
The wrong path is to make health care run the same way as the post office .
Obama seems to favor the latter path , even though he admits that it is the least well - performing one .
This is surely the definition of fanaticism .
If the mobs are n’t angry , they should be .

GAINESVILLE —
A common antibiotic can function as an “ off switch ” for a gene therapy being developed for Parkinson ’s disease , according to University of Florida researchers writing online in advance of September ’s Molecular Therapy .
The discovery in rats answers an important question — how can new , therapeutic genes that have been irrevocably delivered to the human brain to treat Parkinson ’s be controlled if the genes unexpectedly start causing problems ?
Meanwhile , in a review of Parkinson treatments , the researchers say that prior experimental attempts using growth factors — naturally occurring substances that cause cells to grow and divide ?
to rescue dying brain cells may have failed because they occurred too late in the course of the disease .
Together , the findings suggest that gene therapy to enable the brain to retain its ability to produce dopamine , a neurotransmitter that falls in critically short supply in Parkinson ’s patients , could be safely attempted during earlier stages of the disease with an added likelihood of success .
Parkinson ’s disease affects more than 1 million Americans , causing patients to gradually develop movement problems , including tremors , stiffness and slowness .
It is caused by degeneration and death of nerve connections that produce dopamine , a substance necessary for communication between cells that coordinate movement .
“ We have worked every day for 10 years to design a construct to the gene delivery vector that enhances the safety profile of gene transfer for Parkinson ’s disease , ” said Ronald Mandel , a professor of neuroscience at UF ’s McKnight Brain Institute and the Powell Gene Therapy Center .
“ With that added measure of safety , we believe we can intervene with gene transfer in patients at earlier stages of the disease .
We strongly believe that trials to save dopamine - producing connections in patients with Parkinson ’s disease have failed because the therapy went into patients who were in the late stages of the disease and who had too few remaining dopamine - producing connections . ”
Often patients are given prescriptions for levodopa , or L - dopa , which is converted into dopamine by enzymes in the brain .
But the treatment loses its effectiveness over time and does nothing to slow the disease ’s progression .
Meanwhile , trials in the United States to treat Parkinson ’s involving direct infusion of growth factors or the transplantation of genes that produce growth factors have had limited success , with some side effects .
Mandel ’s research group has concentrated on using an adeno - associated virus to engineer brain cells in animal models with genes that can protect dopamine - producing cells , which then do the vital work of producing GDNF , short for glial cell line - derived neurotrophic factor .
The naturally occurring protein is important for the survival of dopamine - producing neurons during brain development , and a survival factor when given to adults .
In this case , scientists engineered the virus with two genes that must act in concert to produce the protein .
But this precise interaction can be inhibited with dietary doxycycline , an antibiotic that is often prescribed in low doses to treat bacterial growth related to acne .
Depending on the amount of the antibiotic , protein production can be reduced or stopped , which would for the first time give medical investigators the ability to regulate gene therapy after the treatment was delivered .
“ With this technique , you could adjust the therapy in the patient , ” said Fredric P. Manfredsson , a postdoctoral associate in UF ’s department of neuroscience .
“ That would be extremely helpful because no one is really certain yet what dosage is required for a protective effect in humans .
The process is also much more sensitive than we had imagined it would be .
GDNF production can be shut down completely with a dose of doxycycline that is much smaller than what is commonly prescribed . ”
Mandel said that adding the safety construct to the gene vector and proving its effectiveness were arduous tasks in which Manfredsson played an essential role .
A variety of methods were used to gauge GDNF production , but one was uncommon and involved the novel observation of the rats ’ weight .
In prior research , the scientists had found delivering the protein to certain regions of the brain would hinder weight gain in younger rats and can cause weight loss in older rats .
In the recent experiments , scientists found they could control the rate of weight gain in the rats with dietary doxycycline , which essentially verified they were controlling the GDNF therapy .
“ The ability to control gene regulation is important for the future development of gene therapy , and optimizing its safe application to humans , ” said Dr. Mark Tuszynski , a professor of neurosciences and director of the Center for Neural Repair at the University of California , San Diego , who did not participate in the research .
“ The work of Dr. Mandel and colleagues brings us an important step closer to this goal . ”
The work was supported by the National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke .

What do all scientists have in common ?
No , it is not that they wear pocket protectors or are geeks .
It is that they all ask questions .
Lots and lots of questions , since asking questions about what you see is one way to figure out how things work .

However , it is not always clear how particular observations can shed light on how our Universe works .
Have you ever wondered how scientists work to understand the things in the skies around us ?
Have you ever wondered what the rocket scientists at NASA DO at work all day ?
Or how they spend their weekend ?

The PS3 Slim has been at the eye of a massive rumor storm for months , but now that Sony hasfinally made it officialit ’s time to bring the facts .
By now you probably know the general specs – it includes a 120 GB HDD , it ’s $ 300/€300 , it ’s out September 1st , and it ’s , well , slimmer – but no self - respecting , hardware - obsessing , early - adopting gamer would stop there .
Read on to snag twelve of the PS3 Slim ’s most overlooked details and you ’ll know more than the next guy when it ’s released next month .
1 . It ’s not actually called the “ PS3 Slim ” – it ’s just the PS3 or the PlayStation 3 .
It is a new PS3 for sure , but nowhere on the box or in the documentation will you see the words “ PS3 ” and “ Slim ” next to each other .
Nevertheless , we ’ll keep calling it the “ PS3 Slim ” for the sake of convenience .
2 . The logo is beautifully etched into the machine ( above ) , and not only that , the old branding is gone for good - no more tacky Spider - Man font !
No more PLAYSTATION 3 , either – Sony decided to stop yelling at us with every press release and just call it the “ PlayStation 3 . ” Much better .
3 . It has buttons !
Those weird , touch - sensitive non-buttons are gone , and they ’ve been replaced with that wonderful , tactile CLICK that only real buttons can deliver .
4 . This is what the new ad campaign looks like :
5 . It ’s smaller , but not in every way .
It ’sthinner and lighter , but as you can see in the comparison below , it 's a bit longer from the rear to the front .
They had to fit all those graphics in there somehow .
6 . It ’s quieter !
With power consumption two - thirds what it was , there ’s a lot less fan - blowing and a lot more sweet serenity .
7 . It only comes with composite cables .
Yes , composite .
Not even component , and definitely no HDMI .
8 . If you have a Bravia TV and you hook up your new PS3 with an HDMI cable ( … not included ) , you can operate the PS3 ’s media bar with your TV ’s remote – you can even set it to turn the system off when you turn the TV off .
9 . The hard drive IS removable - though it does n’t initially appear to be .
There ’s a little hole by the drive bay which contains a screw that holds the HDD in place .
Pop that open , unscrew it , and you ’re in business .
10 .
It ’s not backwards compatible with the PS2 , but it might work with some PSX games .
That ’s right , the PS3 Slim cannot play PlayStation 2 games , but some PlayStation games will work .
The only appropriate response to this statement is “ lol wut ? ”
11 . It has a tiny stand - by light .
Look how cute it is :
12 . The games advertised on the back of the box are : inFAMOUS , Madden NFL 10 , Tekken 6 , MAG , and Uncharted 2 : Among Thieves .
Does that tell us anything ?
Not really , but it is something you probably did n’t know .
C -c -c - combo breaker : Bonus facts !
We could n't possibly stop at just twelve things when there 's so much to say .

Abercrombie and Fitch has been fined $ 115,264 for discrimination , four years after employees at the Mall of America store refused to allow a family member to accompany an autistic girl into a fitting room .
Judge Kathleen
Sheehy , an administrative law judge , found that the retailer had discriminated against the 14 - year - old girl , in violation of state statutes .
Sheehy ordered the fine this month , after the retailer repeatedly refused to respond to the daughter 's mother 's request for an apology and denied engaging in discriminatory practices .
The retailer has appealed , charging that the fine is excessive .
The judge found that the girl , whose name has not been identified , suffered mental anguish as a result of the incident .
A psychologist who interviewed the autistic girl said she reported feeling " bad , " " scared , " and " nervous . "
The girl told the psychologist , " It 's all my fault .
I hate autism . "
She added , " I am a misfit at Abercrombie . "
A spokesperson for Abercrombie and Fitch declined to comment , citing pending litigation .
The girl had been shopping for school clothes with her 17 - year - old sister at the Bloomington store in August 2005 .
Her sister requested to accompany her into the fitting room , and told an associate that her sister has a disability and can not be left alone .
The associate then told the sister that corporate policy mandated that only one person be allowed in the fitting room at a time .
He refused to let the sister accompany the autistic girl , even when the sister provided information about the girl 's disability .
The sister then called her mother , who had been shopping at a nearby store in the mall .
The mother , Elizabeth Maxson , arrived and questioned the associate about the policy .
She explained that her 17 - year - old daughter was a caregiver and asked that she be allowed to accompany the autistic girl into the fitting room .
Maxson asked to see a copy of the store 's policy , but employees said they could not locate it .
She then asked for the customer service phone number , and left the store to call the company .
The mother said a customer service employee told her , " So , you think our fitting room policy is ridiculous , " according to court documents .
Maxson asked to file a complaint about the incident , but the employee offered no further assistance .
She then returned to the store and asked to speak with a manager .
An assistant manager said he could not deviate from the policy .
He offered to let the Maxsons buy as many clothes as they wanted , try them on at home , and then return the items that did not fit .
Maxson sent two letters to the retailer , but received no response .
She called customer service again to ask for the record of her telephone complaint .
A customer service representative declined to provide records , and stated they were for company use only .
She then reported the incident to the Minnesota Department of Human Rights , which began an investigation .
The company 's associate handbook states that only one person is allowed in a fitting room at a time , but adds , " Some exceptions to this rule include parents with their kids and a disabled person 's assistant . "
The company designed the policy to reduce theft .
However , the employees interviewed by the department said that since the girl did not have a visible disability , they could not confirm that she needed reasonable accommodations .
The associate manager later changed his testimony , and said that the sister never told him that the girl had a disability .
The judge found that the employee 's original testimony was more accurate .
Rita Shreffler , the executive director of the National Autism Association , said discrimination against people with autism is common , although she has not heard of other incidents involving fitting rooms .
" The attitude is kind of pervasive out there that because you can't see the disability , an assumption is made that something else is off , " Shreffler said .
" This breaks my heart , " Shreffler said , adding that she thinks the fines should have been higher .
Sheehy ordered the company to pay the girl $ 25,000 for mental anguish , and cover $ 41,069 in attorney fees .
The company also had to pay a $ 25,000 fine , as well as other expenses totaling $ 24,194 .
The Office of Administrative Hearings filed a document arguing that Abercrombie and Fitch bore responsibility for the steep fines .
The company " adopted a litigation strategy of ' admit nothing , ' refusing to admit the existence of [ the girl 's ] disability until the outset of the hearing , and denying even the possibility that she had suffered from the experience at Respondent 's store .
These decisions escalated the cost of this proceeding for all parties , " Office of Administrative Hearings officials wrote .
The company has been ordered to post signs near the fitting rooms in all Minnesota stores stating the fitting room policy , and explaining that disabled customers can request an exception .
The company must also provide additional disability training to employees , and review and revise its policies related to customers with disabilities .
Ryan Grim 's new book , This is Your Country on Drugs , has revived interest in drug use and drug policy .
Around the time it hit the streets , this map of drug use by state ( via Map Scroll ) started circulating around the Internet .
As it turns out , the map is based on detailed data from the National Survey of Drug Use and Health on the use of various types of " illegal drugs " by state .
So , with this treasure trove of data in hand , and with the help of two colleagues , the Swedish regional economist , Charlotta Mellander , and Cambridge University personality psychologist , Jason Rentfrow , we decided to take a look at the relationship between drug use and various political , economic , and psychological characteristics of states .
There 's a lot of research that examines the effects of factors like income , poverty , and race on the propensity to use drugs .
But our team has been focusing on the role of the psycho-social , as well as economic factors , on state and regional outcomes .
A pioneering study by Rentfrow , Sam Gosling , and Jeff Porter identified the effects of personality factors on state - level economic and social outcomes .
So we wanted to extend this line of research to see if and how these various economic , demographic , and personality factors might be related to drug use .
We are knee - deep in a more extensive research project , but our preliminary results looked so interesting we thought we would report them and encourage feedback .
Mr Sarkozy says the French must cut their energy consumption
French President Nicolas Sarkozy has announced plans for a new carbon tax aimed at combating global warming .
The tax will be introduced next year and will cover the use of oil , gas and coal , he said .
The new tax will be 17 euros ( £ 15 ) per tonne of emitted carbon dioxide ( CO2 ) .
It will be phased in gradually .
It will apply to households as well as enterprises , but not to the heavy industries and power firms included in the EU 's emissions trading scheme .
Most electricity in France - excluded from the new carbon tax - is nuclear generated .
Mr Sarkozy said revenues from the new tax would be ploughed back into taxpayers ' pockets through cuts in other taxes and " green cheques " .
The carbon tax plans have already encountered stiff opposition across the political spectrum .
France 's Le Monde newspaper says the tax will cover 70 % of the country 's carbon emissions and bring in about 4.3 bn euros ( £ 3.8 bn ) of revenue annually .
Mr Sarkozy insists the new tax is all about persuading the French to change their habits and cut energy consumption , the BBC's Emma Jane Kirby reports from Paris .
Critics say it is just a ploy to boost ailing state finances .
Two - thirds of French voters say they are opposed to the new levy , fearing they will struggle to pay higher bills .
Prime Minister Francois Fillon had previously set the new tax rate at 14 euros per tonne of CO2 .
The Republicans have been going around saying , before Ted Kennedy passed , that if " Kennedy was around we would have a deal " .
Senator Ted Kennedy said this in 1978 about health care :
More than most Americans , I know what it means to have serious illness in the family .
My father vas crippled by a stroke and required constant care for years .
My son was stricken by cancer , and is well today because of the miracle of American medicine .
A decade ago , I myself was hospitalized for several months , my back broken in many places .
Fortunately , our family could afford to pay for all the care we needed .
And so the tragedy of serious illness for those we loved was not compounded by the additional tragedy of a heavy financial burden .
Together , we can lift that financial burden from all the families of America .
Through national health insurance , we can provide a decent health care system for the benefit of the people of this land .
We can make health care a basic right for all , not just an expensive privilege for the few .
But to achieve the reform , we need , we must have genuine leadership by the Democratic Party .
We are heirs of a great tradition in American public life .
Our party took up the cause of jobs for the unemployed in the Great Depression .
Our party took up the cause of civil rights for black and brown Americans , and the cause of equal rights for women in America and the people of the District of Columbia .
In that same tradition of leadership , it is time for the Democratic Party now to take up the cause of health .
Ted Kennedy was never on the same page as the likes of Chuck Grassley , John McCain ( who really wants to be envisioned as Kennedy Redux , but NOT ) , and the rest of the gang of GOP .
I also want you to know that even though I am ill , I 'm committed to do everything I can to achieve access to health care for everyone in my country .
This has been the political cause of my life .
Note , we must have LEADERSHIP from the Democratic Party .
Well , the Democratic Party has been all over the spectrum for health care , in fact many have taken money and lots of money from the very entity we are fighting with .
The final leadership must come from the White House and President Barack Obama must draw his line in the sand .
But for the Republicans to just yank Senator Ted Kennedy and his use him for political points is appaling .
Kennedy was not on their page and for them to even make reference that he was is just outrageous .
It boldly states Kennedy 's stand on health care : Health care reform , for damn sure , has not been the cause of the Republican Party or any of its member 's lives , the only thing that comes close for them is taking the lobbyist checks and voting their way for blockage of any health care reform .
Let 's not get it twisted Republicans , Senator Ted Kennedy has fought for health care for all Americans all his LIFE , for you to try to twist , yank or change his words will be absoulutely the wrong thing to do .
The BBFC 's decision means it will now be illegal to sell or supply the film
A Japanese horror film has been refused an 18 certificate by the British Board of Film Classification ( BBFC ) because of its graphic torture scenes .
According to BBFC director David Cooke , Grotesque presented " little more than an unrelenting and escalating scenario of humiliation , brutality and sadism " .
Its " unacceptable content " , he added , meant cuts were " not a viable option " .
The BBFC rarely refuses to pass films , having denied only three titles seeking an 18 rating over the last four years .
These include violent sex thriller Murder Set Pieces and Terrorists , Killers And Other Wackos , a film comprising real clips of execution and torture .
' Minimal narrative '
Two pornographic works seeking the restricted R18 rating have also been rejected in the same period .
The distributors of Grotesque had hoped to receive an 18 certificate for the film , which includes scenes involving amputation and eye - gouging .
" The chief pleasure on offer seems to be in the spectacle of sadism ( including sexual sadism ) for its own sake , " said Mr Cooke .
Its " minimal narrative or character development , " he continued , set it apart from such other " torture - themed " works as the Saw and Hostel movie series .
The BBFC drew criticism earlier this year for passing Danish horror Antichrist uncut , despite its graphic scenes of sex , violence and mutilation .
The warnings to new members of staff were always the same : never put your hands on a pupil ; do not offer them lifts ; do not share your mobile or home phone number ; do not text or email them ; take care with social networking sites and remember – it is against the law to abuse a position of trust .
Teachers and classroom assistants at Headlands school were told when they began that it was " a criminal offence to have a sexual relationship with a pupil under 18 regardless of consent " , and the message was repeated in sessions every September , it has emerged .
Yet it was not enough to stop the Yorkshire comprehensive being branded a " school for scandal " when Christopher Reen became the fifth member of staff in just three years to face criminal charges over relationships with pupils .
The leader of one of the country 's largest teaching unions said yesterday that she was staggered one school had faced so many cases .
" It is absolutely extraordinary and I am sure the local authority and school management will want to look closely at the processes they have in place , " said Chris Keates , general secretary of the NASUWT .
" It is extremely rare for teachers to actually cross that boundary .
We get around 800 allegations a year against members and the vast majority are about physical abuse of pupils .
A very small number , maybe half a dozen , are about inappropriate sexual conduct with a pupil .
Even fewer go to court and not all those end in a conviction .
It is a tiny number of teachers – so to have such a concentration in one school makes that an extraordinary situation . "
Reen , 31 , faces jail after admitting having a sexual relationship with a pupil to whom he sent hundreds of text messages .
But the classroom supervisor – who had recently married and whose wife was pregnant – claimed he did not know the girl was under 16 .
A jury was discharged last week after it failed to reach a majority verdict over whether Reen was aware of the girl 's age .
He would have faced a much longer sentence had that been the case .
The Crown Prosecution Service was given seven days to consider a retrial .
But what makes Headlands extraordinary are the cases preceding Reen's .
The first scandal to engulf the school was that of Ian Blott , 55 , an art teacher who was jailed for four years in 2006 after seducing a 15 - year - old girl .
Just a year later , science teacher Steven Edwards , 35 , was given a sentence of four years and nine months after being convinced of having three affairs with teenage girls .
Then in 2008 Terry Mann , a former Headlands IT teacher , received a 12 - month suspended sentence for having sex with an under age girl at another school .
In the fourth case , a female classroom supervisor was given a conditional discharge over her relationship with a boy .
" We expected parent groups to yell about it , " said one local resident who attended town council meetings .
" Every week people talk about parking and shopping and other issues – but no one ever brought up this .
Of course we knew it was unusual to have so many cases in one school . "
In fact , the issue of Headlands was raised once at a town council meeting in Bridlington , East Riding , this summer , but officials decided it was for the school and the local authority to deal with .
East Riding council , meanwhile , insisted that it had tried to stop the rot .
Training sessions for all new staff covered appropriate behaviour with pupils , while governors and senior staff were given special sessions on recruitment and dealing with allegations .
By next term all staff at Headlands will have completed a module on " Awareness of child abuse and neglect " .
Regular warnings reminded staff to avoid being alone in a room with individual pupils and to tell child protection co-ordinators if a pupil 's behaviour was causing concern .
The executive headteacher , Chris Abbott , said the school tried desperately to stop further scandals and brought in a " whistleblowing policy " .
She said : " This highlights that while the school has done all within its power to prevent this happening , we still need the vigilance of staff , pupils , parents and residents to highlight any concerns they may have .
Safeguarding children is the responsibility of us all . "
In Bridlington , many people say they remain supportive of the school – saying the blame lies solely with the individuals involved .
Nevertheless , the number of cases has astonished many residents who point out that the town 's other secondary school has had no such trouble .
" I would like to think that lessons have been learned and that this would not happen now to any other family and that there 's an end to it , " said one parent .
" I think after five cases , surely systems must now be in place and people should know the severity of it . "
East Riding is not the only council to drill all new teachers about how to behave appropriately with pupils – it is something that is spreading across the country .
The General Teaching Council for England runs courses for trainee teachers and addressed 10,000 of them between March and July this year .
" We have a session that we provocatively bill : ' Is it anybody 's business what you do in your private life ? , " said Fiona Johnson , director of communications at the GTC .
" We talk to them about what it means to be a professional and one thing some say is : ' I guess I will have to leave Facebook behind ' .
" It is not so much that they can't use it but it is more about being alert to the idea that they may need to ring - fence who can access their profile . "
Teaching unions also offer training .
Keates described how the NASUWT spoke to newly qualified teachers about the risks they could face .
" We talk to them about their vulnerability to young people developing crushes on them and wanting to develop too close relationships , " she said .
" We tell them that they need to be very alert if a pupil becomes overly attentive – coming into the classroom after school finishes or hanging around their car – and to tell a senior member of staff .
It is a very difficult thing to deal with and teachers can find themselves victims of false allegations because the pupil feels slighted . "
Keates said the union had also approached the Training and Development Agency for Schools encouraging it to include clear messages in teacher training .
" But most people know the type of relationships they should develop with young people and the types they should not , " she added .
" The problem is the culture that has developed in schools – teachers are finding themselves in more difficulties because they are encouraged to get very involved with pupils . "
There was an expectation for teachers to be " more accessible in their attitude " , she said , and more available out of school hours and by email .
In one case she described how a teacher spoke to pupils about poetry via a webcam in his home .
Technology , added Keates , could be dangerous because email messages were less formal and more open to misinterpretation .
" Our concern is that this new culture is starting to break down the boundaries of professional relationships and make everything more informal – and that starts to muddy that clear distance that has to be kept .
" It does n't have to be a threatening distance , but in all communications there should be no chance of it being misinterpreted . "
She added : " The changing culture in schools , the increasing use of technology , the additional contact outside the classroom – that might explain some of the things that have happened but it does n't excuse them . "
Rachel Maddow talks to the AARP 's John Rother about the fear mongering astroturf ad campaigns targeted specifically to scare the hell out of seniors on health care reform .
As we 've discussed before , the health care reform is a secret plot to kill old people rumor was started by a woman named Betsy McCaughey .
She is the person who in " The New York Post " and on right - wing talk radio first promulgated this idea that Medicare covering consultations about living wills is secretly the murder of the elderly .
What 's being called a debate about health care policy right now is so far from an actual debate about health care policy that the charge from his critics that the president of the United States has to rebut in public is whether or not he wants health care reform because he secretly wants to kill all of the old people .
And apparently he does n't .
MADDOW : Also , the president would like to make clear that he is not in favor of rubbing chewing gum into everyone 's hair , nor is he in favor of forced sex changes , nor is he in favor of making everyone wear nude - colored panty hose on their hands like mittens all year around just for the pure inconvenience of it all .
He 'd like to make that clear .
The irony is that actually one of the chief sponsors of this bill originally was a Republican then - House member , now - senator named Johnny Isakson from Georgia who very sensibly thought this is something that would expand people 's options .
And somehow , it 's gotten spun into this idea of death panels .
I am not in favor of that .
So just - I want to - I want to - I want to clear the air here .
BARACK OBAMA :
The rumor that 's been circulating a lot lately is this idea that somehow the House of Representatives voted for death panels that will basically pull the plug on grandma because we 've decided that we do n't - it 's too expensive to let her live anymore .
I guess this arose out of a provision in one of the House bills that allowed Medicare to reimburse people for consultations about end - of - life care , setting up living wills , the availability of hospice , et cetera .
( BEGIN AUDIO CLIP )
BETSY MCCAUGHEY : Congress would make it mandatory - absolutely require that every five years people in Medicare have a required counseling session that will tell them how to end their life sooner .
( END AUDIO CLIP )
MADDOW : That is not true at all , not a word of it .
Not mandatory , not require , not every five years , not counseling , not tell them , not how to , not end their life .
None of the words in that claim are true except maybe the two " that 's " and the word " in . "
It 's not true , but it is convenient , and so it survives .
And it is in fact being promoted more than ever .
It 's convenient for the interest opposed health care reform to scare old people about reform .
And so , there 's now $ 1.5 million nationwide TV ad buy for this ad which we highlighted on last night 's show , and now , that says the government will decide whether or not old people are worth the cost .
As we discussed on last night 's show , the ads by a group called 60 Plus .
It 's a corporate - funded interest group that pretends like it's an advocacy organization for seniors .
And today , 60 Plus has gone even further .
Reporter Greg Sargent at " The Plum Line " cited for the second time on tonight 's show has obtained a new mailer from 60 Plus - and as is often the case in politics , what they put in the direct mail piece is much worse than what they 're willing to put on television .
For example , the big poll quote in the mailer includes this out - of - context quote from President Obama , " Maybe you 're better off not having the surgery , but taking the painkiller . "
See , the president wants old people with health problems to take the painkiller .
Maybe even take a lot of painkillers , if you know what I mean .
This is a group that claims to represent seniors .
The way they have chosen to represent seniors in this particular fight is to try to scare seniors into thinking their government wants to kill them .
With friends like these , who needs corporate - funded fake grassroots enemies ?
Joining us now is John Rother .
He is executive vice president of policy at AARP .
Mr. Rother , thank you very much for coming on the show tonight .
I appreciate it .
JOHN ROTHER : Good evening .
MADDOW : Now , on the surface , it looks like your organization , AARP , and 60 Plus could be rival groups .
Are we looking at a turf war between your two competing organizations here , or is there something that 's fundamentally different about these two groups ?
ROTHER : Well , we represent 40 million members , 50 and older .
We do n't know if they have members or what they do when there 's not a big controversy .
But clearly , they 're funded primarily by corporate interests , especially pharmaceuticals .
So , there 's a big difference .
We take no corporate money .
We have no pharmaceutical money .
Our income is from member dues and the services and products that members buy .
MADDOW : One of the things that we have talked about on this show is the investigation that is AARP bulletin did a couple of years ago into why 60 Plus was opposing pharmaceutical reform at the state level .
Can you tell us what that organization found about this group ?
ROTHER : Well , we hired an independent investigator and found that 60 Plus in that year was taking most of its money from the pharmaceutical industry and kind of using it as a screen to pretend that they were really representing the interest of seniors , when in fact , of course , seniors very much want more affordable medications .
But 60 Plus never owned up to who was funding it until well after the fact .
MADDOW : You know , everybody is being hit with misinformation about health care reform .
But one of the reasons I wanted to talk to you , Mr. Rother , is because it seems like seniors are being targeted with some of the scariest allegations .
Do you think that is by design , that older people are being singled out for this type of - these types of scare tactics ?
Have you seen this kind of strategy before ?
ROTHER : I do n't think you can look at those commercials and not conclude that seniors are the target of a very intentional scare campaign .
And many seniors , of course , are worried about change because they depend on Medicare .
They are perhaps not in the greatest of health , and they definitely want to know that Medicare will be there , their doctor will be there when they need it .
So , change can be a little scary .
On the other hand , when we 've looked at this bill and we read every page , we 've concluded that the bills proposed in the Congress would be good for seniors , would actually help them afford their medications better , make sure that doctors are there when they need them .
So , we feel there 's nothing to be scared about in the actual legislation .
MADDOW : I know that you 're the executive vice president of policy at AARP and your job is to be analytical and to do these things sort of to the letter and to the service of your members .
But I just have to ask you if it - if it makes you mad to see fearmongering of America 's seniors over this issue or any policy issue , does it ?
For me , it makes me feel protective and angry .
ROTHER :
It certainly makes me angry because , you know , there are real issues and people should be engaged in this debate .
But to scare people , to raise these bogus issues , to intentionally mislead a big part of the population is - you know , it 's a subversion of democracy .
And it does make me mad .
And I think that the news media , such as yourself , are starting to catch on to what 's going on .
MADDOW : John Rother , executive vice president of policy for the American Association of Retired Persons , AARP - thank you so much for joining us tonight , sir .
Thank you .
ROTHER : Thank you , Rachel .
Despite repeated denials by Number 10 that the war made Britain a target for terrorists , a letter from Michael Jay , the Foreign Office permanent under - secretary , to the cabinet secretary , Sir Andrew Turnbull - obtained by this newspaper - makes the connection clear .
The letter , dated 18 May 2004 , says British foreign policy was a ' recurring theme ' in the Muslim community , 'especially in the context of the Middle East peace process and Iraq ' .
' Colleagues have flagged up some of the potential underlying causes of extremism that can affect the Muslim community , such as discrimination , disadvantage and exclusion , ' the letter says .
' But another recurring theme is the issue of British foreign policy , especially in the context of the Middle East peace process and Iraq .
' Experience of both ministers and officials ... suggests that ...
British foreign policy and the perception of its negative effect on Muslims globally plays a significant role in creating a feeling of anger and impotence among especially the younger generation of British Muslims . '
The letter continues : ' This seems to be a key driver behind recruitment by extremist organisations ( e.g. recruitment drives by groups such as Hizb - ut - Tahrir and al Muhajiroon ) .
The FCO has a relevant and crucial role to play in the wider context of engagement with British Muslims on policy issues , and more broadly , in convincing young Muslims that they have a legitimate and credible voice , including on foreign policy issues , through an active participation in the democratic process . '
Al Muhajiroon , formed by Omar Bakri Mohammed , the radical preacher who fled Britain after the 7 July bombings , was a recruiting organisation for young Islamic extremists in Britain .
Attached to the letter is a strategy document , also obtained by The Observer , which reveals further concerns .
It says Britain is now viewed as a ' crusader state ' , on a par with America as a potential target .
' Muslim resentment towards the West is worse than ever , ' the document , ' Building Bridges with Mainstream Islam ' , says .
' This was previously focused on the US , but the war in Iraq has meant the UK is now seen in similar terms - both are now seen by many Muslims as " Crusader states " .
' Though we are moving on from a conflict to a reconstruction phase in Iraq , there are no signs of any moderation of this resentment .
Our work on engaging with Islam has therefore been knocked back .
Mr O'Brien [ then a Foreign Office minister ] has expressed his concern . '
However , all mention of the Iraq connection to extremism was removed from ' core scripts ' - briefing papers given to ministers to defend the government 's position on Iraq and terror .
The document begins : ' We do not see the Muslim community as a threat .
Muslims have always made , and continue to make , a valuable contribution to society . '
The lines to be used by ministers include measures designed to address Muslim concerns , such as the introduction of religious hatred legislation and tackling educational underachievement among Muslims .
But there is nothing to address the concerns raised by Jay eight months earlier .
The documents reveal deep divisions at the heart of government over home - grown religious extremism and its connections to British intervention in Iraq .
The Prime Minister has consistently said that the bombers were motivated not by a sense of injustice but by a ' perverted and poisonous misinterpretation of Islam ' .
Although Iraq was clearly used as a pretext by extremists , he said he believed it was ideology that drove them to kill .
To press home the point , Downing Street issued a list of atrocities carried out before intervention in Afghanistan and Iraq .
The claim was later undermined by the MI5 , which said that Iraq was the ' dominant issue ' for Islamic extremists in Britain .
Jack Straw , the Foreign Secretary , also rowed back from his comments immediately after the bombings that there was no connection with Iraq and the terror threat after it became clear that the public remained unconvinced .
But Jay 's letter shows that the Foreign Office was convinced that foreign policy played a key role in radicalising young Muslims .
The letter outlines a list of 11 ' work streams ' to discourage extremism .
They included delegations to the Islamic world , ministerial briefings for key members of the Muslim community and receptions to mark key Muslim festivals .
It is not known how Turnbull responded to the letter , although it is clear that , by January , there was a significant difference between what was being said within the Foreign Office and what ministers were officially being permitted to say in speeches .
Liberal Democrat home affairs spokesman Mark Oaten last night called on the government to come clean about the link between extremism among British Muslims and anger about Iraq : ' For the government to deny a link between the war in Iraq and dismay among the Muslim community is ridiculous .
But to try to cover it up , when senior civil servants have recognised the seriousness of the resentment , is even worse . '
