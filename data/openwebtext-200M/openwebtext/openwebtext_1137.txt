The latest trial balloon from the Democratic leadership is that they might split healthcare reform into two bills .
The first would have all the controversial provisions and would go through the reconciliation process , where it needs only 50 votes .
The second would go through the normal process and therefore need 60 votes , but since it includes the stuff that ’s widely popular it would pass anyway .
But Ezra Klein is puzzled : if you piss off Republicans by using reconciliation for Bill # 1 , what are the odds you can then sweet talk them into supporting Bill # 2 ?
The one potential answer is that reconciliation is n’t about bypassing the GOP at all .
It ’s about bypassing a handful of centrist Democrats .
Angry Republicans wo n’t support a consensus - oriented second bill after being cut out of the important work of the first .
But Democrats like Kent Conrad might , as reconciliation wo n’t specifically have hurt them , even as its real point was to take the process out of their hands and put it back in the hand of the Democratic Senate Leadership .
It ’s hard to say if this chatter is really serious , but if it is the point is probably to protect centrist Democrats .
They can vote against Bill # 1 and for Bill # 2 , and then go home and tell their constituents that they voted against a gummint takeover of healthcare ( public option , strong subsidies ) but in favor of sticking it to the evil insurance industry .
At least , that ’s the usual thinking behind this kind of thing .
Harry Reid probably is n’t under the delusion that he can get more then one or two Republican votes no matter what , but he does care about protecting the flanks of his own caucus .
This is one way to do it .
A Ynet investigation revealed Wednesday that the hijacking of the Russian vessel ' Arctic Sea ' was ordered by the Russian government .
News agencies around the world published reports tying Israel to the hijacking , as the vessel was said to have been carrying arms to the Middle East , and possibly Iran .
Contrasting Reports EU source implies Israel behind July hijacking of Russian ship Ynet Admiral Tarmo Kouts , who heads European Union 's piracy watch , tells Time Magazine Israel was most likely responsible for hijacking of Arctic Sea in an attempt to intercept Mideast bound missile delivery EU source implies Israel behind July hijacking of Russian ship
Admiral Tarmo Kouts , the European Union 's rapporteur on piracy , told Time Magazine he believed the Arctic Sea was intercepted by Israel as it carried a secret cargo of S - 300 anti-aircraft missiles and X - 500 anti-ship missiles to the Middle East .
A Ynet investigation based on a number of Russian , European , and Middle Eastern sources has concluded that the admiral 's thesis is not plausible for a number of reasons .
For example , the missiles ' route to Finland remains unclear , as well as the Mossad 's reasons for hijacking the ship rather than arresting it mid-route and unloading the supplies .
The Kremlin has so far kept silent on the matter , after having arrested the alleged hijackers on August 18 and charging them with kidnapping and piracy .
It has made no comment on reports speculating Israel was behind the deed , and Jerusalem has followed suit .
The investigation has revealed that the ship first set sail not from Finland , but rather from the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad .
Located on the Baltic shore , the area has been historically considered a closed military zone .

The Kaliningrad port , manned by the Russian navy , holds missile batteries which include S - 300 anti-aircraft weapons .
The Kremlin has declared the city a free trade zone but it is considered to be ruled and operated by unions of former soviet security forces , and a hotbed of illegal trade that includes various types of weapons .
Sources say the Arctic Sea docked in Kaliningrad in June to undergo various repairs .
The same sources say a deal was previously struck between Russian and Middle Eastern businessmen , agreeing on the sale of some of the S - 300 missiles located at the port .
Some sources claim the Russian military 's weapons industry was implicated in the deal and transferred a number of new missiles , including the X - 500 , to the port to be included in the sale .
However the Kremlin was uninvolved , and apparently the deal was carried out in secret between businessmen from the private sector .
An anonymous tip
After the deal was executed , an intelligence agency whose identity so far remains unexposed learned of the ship 's departure with the weapons in tow towards Algeria , a country located on a regularly used route for the transfer of weapons to Iran and Syria .
The intelligence agency then transferred an anonymous tip to the Russian authorities , according to the investigation .
Then , two days after the Arctic Sea sailed from a Finnish port where it apparently picked up timber in order to cover up the missiles , a motorboat carrying eight people drew up to the ship and asked to board due to having been lost at sea .
The eight then identified themselves as Swedish police and arrested the crew under gunpoint .
The Russian sailors serving on the Arctic Sea said the officers spoke Russian between themselves .
Twelve hours later the ship 's crew reported the incident to the Swedish authorities and said the hijackers had impersonated Swedish police .
The crew said the hijackers had left the ship but in actuality they remained , holding the crew hostage .
On April 28 the British coast guard contacted the ship , and its captain reported everything was fine .
The vessel was allowed to continue sailing towards Algeria and shortly afterwards all contact with it was lost .

According to Russian sources the " hijackers " , who in actuality were Russian intelligence officers , remained on the ship and reported to their superiors that they had found the missiles on board .
On August 12 Russia announced it had sent naval officers to rescue the vessel and its crew .
The sources say the period of time between the hijacking and the Russian rescue mission was due to the Kremlin 's desire to capture the ship away from the eyes of the media , in order to avoid an embarrassing incident that may have harmed its relations with Iran and Algeria .
But Russia also desired to avoid an incident with Israel and the US , the sources say .
Four years ago the country signed a deal with the two allied nations promising to refrain from transferring " destabilizing " arms to Syria or Tehran .
The S -300 missiles were specifically included in the accord .
On August 18 Russian commando forces overtook the ship and arrested the hijackers .
Pictures released to the press show Russian soldiers forcing the eight men harshly onto land .
The cargo was taken to an undisclosed location in Russia by eight large cargo planes immediately after the incident was made public .

This total disrespect have turned many Americans away from the Republican Party tonight , in fact it has just validated the fringe , hate , racist party even more .
In all the times George W. Bush addressed congress , not one member of congress was disrespectful .
This was totally disrespectful .
One of the most persistent conservative concerns about health care legislation is that it will provide health care to illegal immigrants -- and the heated claim spilled onto the floor of President Obama 's address to a joint session of Congress this evening , where one Republican member called the president a liar for denying it .
" There are also those who claim that our reform effort will insure illegal immigrants .
This , too , is false - the reforms I 'm proposing would not apply to those who are here illegally , " President Obama said .
A loud voice from the Republican side of the hall answered , " Lie " -- my colleague Glenn Thrush reports it was Rep. Joe Wilson ( R - S.C. ) -- drawing a second " It 's not true , " from Obama and a shake of Nancy Pelosi 's head .
Wilson 's words were " totally disrespectful .
He should apologize immediately , " McCain said .
And we want THIS to retake congress ?
I do n't think so .
[ UPDATE ]
“ This evening I let my emotions get the best of me when listening to the President ’s remarks regarding the coverage of illegal immigrants in the health care bill .
While I disagree with the President ’s statement , my comments were inappropriate and regrettable .
I extend sincere apologies to the President for this lack of civility . ”
Wilson apparently called the White House to apologize to Obama directly .
Instead he ended up speaking to Rahm Emanuel .
Oh , to have been listening in on that f@( &ing conversation .
" a dumbass "
In response to Wilson ’s inappropriate claim that Obama is a liar , the conservative Scarborough tweeted , “ Whoever shouted out that the president was lying is a dumbass who should show the President respect .
I hated when Democrats shouted at Bush . ”
And Senator John McCain said this :
This was quick .
Due to protocal in the chamber and the embarrassment this man has made to his own party , Congressman Joe Wilson has apologized for his actions .
Expect him to be trounced , royally on blogs , the news and cable .
As it should be .
And Wilson called the White House but got Chief of Staff , Rahm Emanuel , oh boy .
Lastly , morning joe , Joe Scarborough calls WilsonLet 's do even more , let 's raise money for Wilson 's opponent and take this disrespectful congressman OUT .
A New South Wales council has approved the demolition of one of the state 's most recognisable roadside landmarks , Ballina 's Big Prawn .
Ballina Shire general manager Paul Hickey says Thursday afternoon 's vote was 6 - 3 in favour of the demolition .
He says it is not known if the famous fibreglass structure will find a new home .
" The whole relocation of the Big Prawn was a big part of the debate , " he said .
" The toughest issue for council is that we do n't actually own the property , it 's owned by private ownership .
" In the end someone 's got to make a commercial decision as to whether they can move the prawn . "
Ballina 's Mayor has previously said that it has been suggested the crustacean could be replaced with a Big Pelican .
A French court has jailed Marie - Helene Martinez and her husband Jean - Paul Steijns for 20 and 10 years respectively for killing their two children with poisoned cannelloni .
The sentences was less than the 30 years asked for by the public prosecutor and relatives of the murdered children , eight - year - old Melissa and seven - year - old Jason , reacted angrily in court .
" Die , die in prison ! " the children 's aunt shouted at Martinez , 29 , who collapsed in tears when the sentence was read out in the southern town of Aix - en - Provence .
Steijns , 39 , remained impassive throughout the trial .
" They should have got life .
Ten years is nothing for a mother who poisons her children , " shouted another relative , as the children 's grandmother wept silently .
Martinez 's lawyer said he would appeal , even though the move was " an enormous risk " .
Steijns ' lawyer said he accepted the sentence .
At the start of the trial , Martinez had denied killing the two children a day before she gave birth to a still - born baby whose rotting body was later found on her balcony .
The couple decided in 2005 to poison their children , believing they would be better able to pull themselves out of debt without them , the court heard .
Steijns , who is not the biological father of the children , told the court his wife persuaded him to carry out the crime when the couple risked losing their flat in nearby Marseille after several months of defaulting on rent .
But Fernandez told the jury that the couple were both guilty as they had jointly decided to poison their children with the pasta .
On the night of September 18 , 2005 , Melissa and Jason complained that the meat - stuffed cannelloni served by their parents tasted bitter and they went to bed that night without finishing their plates , Le Parisien newspaper reported .
They died that night and the bodies , hidden in a car boot , were discovered a month later when Steijns confessed to police .
Police also found the decomposed body of a newborn baby lying on the balcony of their Marseille apartment in 2005 but the couple is not on trial in that case .
Investigators have been unable to establish the circumstances of the death , given the advanced stage of the body 's decomposition .

There are more Department of Defense contractors in Afghanistan today than there are uniformed U.S. military personnel , according to a new report from the Congressional Research Service .
Not only that , the ratio of contractors to troops in Afghanistan is higher than in any prior military engagement in U.S. history .
“ As of March 2009 , there were 68,197 DOD contractors in Afghanistan , compared to 52,300 uniformed personnel .
Contractors made up 57 % of DOD ’s workforce in Afghanistan .
This apparently represented the highest recorded percentage of contractors used by DOD in any conflict in the history of the United States , ” the CRS report ( pdf ) said .
A copy of the report was obtained by Secrecy News .
At a time when the deployment of U.S. forces in Afghanistan may be increased ( or reduced ) , the CRS report casts a detailed and fairly nuanced spotlight on the role of defense contractors there .
The report notes , for example , that more than 75 % of the DoD contractor personnel in Afghanistan are local nationals .
Only about 15 % are U.S. citizens .
Contractors provide essential logistical , translation and other services , while offering increased flexibility .
But they also pose management challenges in monitoring performance and preventing fraud .
In the worst cases , “ abuses and crimes committed by armed private security contractors and interrogators against local nationals may have undermined U.S. efforts in Iraq and Afghanistan , ” the CRS report noted .

" People go to football to see the best and that 's what they are .
It 's a privilege for Barca to have some of the best footballers like Messi . "

Bradley Wiggins , hunched in a chair and speaking quietly through his exhaustion , remembers the suffering during his hardest day on the Tour de France .
It is a chilling moment .
He has already revealed that he sometimes thinks of himself as a " fraud " for finishing fourth in the race , despite his compelling courage and resilience , and in a contrasting statement has said that he plans eventually to win the Tour .
But this is different .
This is a downbeat murmur that causes goosebumps to rise .
For a second Wiggins looks as though he has seen the ghost of Tom Simpson again , the haunting British cyclist who died on the slopes of Mont Ventoux during the 1967 Tour de France .
" I do n't want this to sound cheesy , " Wiggins says , fearing that a surreal experience might be misconstrued as the delusions of a man driven mad after 2,200 miles on his bike .
" But when I reached Ventoux on the second - last day it felt as if Tom was waiting for me .
As I began the climb it felt as if his spirit was riding with me .
It started on the early slopes and I imagined how Tom must have been feeling , riding towards his death , and the feeling grew as I climbed .
" There were times when Andy Schleck [ who finished second behind Alberto Contador , and just ahead of Lance Armstrong and Wiggins ] was attacking and it was horrible .
I thought , ' I can't go on .
I can't do this anymore …'
But I then thought more vividly of Tom and how he must have felt that last day .
It was like a reason not to give up .
I felt like I was doing it more for his memory than anything . "
Wiggins pauses , ducking his head shyly , as if he might have gone too far .
But the 29 - year - old , who has turned himself from a three - times Olympic gold medal - winning track pursuit rider into one of the world 's great road cyclists , smiles wryly when I stretch out my arms to show him the sudden gooseflesh .
" That 's the feeling I had , " he says .
" A lot of riders will take the piss out of me for saying this – but I do n't think they fully respect the history of the race .
A lot of young riders in the peloton think they 're ' it ' at 22 .
And I 'm not referring to Mark Cavendish [ the young British sprinter who won an extraordinary six stages of the Tour ] in any way .
But half the peloton do n't even know that a person , Tom Simpson , died on the Ventoux .
That 's terribly sad . "
Carrying a small photograph of Simpson with him , to steel himself for a climb that he feared might break him after three weeks on the road , Wiggins was aware that " 90 % of them rode slowly up the Ventoux , chatting to each other , knowing their race was over .
It was different up front .
We had to hit it hard – because the next few hours would decide where we ended on the Tour .
I was exhausted , and emotional , but there were times when I felt fantastic . "
Just as Simpson 's drug - streaked death was a tangled affair , Wiggins 's intense emotions are complicated .
" It 's difficult to describe because I feel a bit of a fraud in some aspects .
Tom Simpson is like the Bobby Moore of British cycling .
I would n't say he was a hero of mine because he was dead a long time before I was born .
But I hold him in such high esteem .
So it does n't feel real .
Great names finish up there in the Tour .
People like [ Carlos ] Sastre … "
The Spanish winner of the 2008 Tour finished 13 places behind Wiggins this year .
And yet , as I remind him , Wiggins outclimbed Sastre and Cadel Evans .
" Yeah , " he grins , " and [ Andreas ] Klöden [ a former Tour runner - up who finished sixth ] .
I beat all those guys .
The first time I realised I could do it was on Verbier [ on the middle Sunday ] .
I attacked Armstrong 's group and I had an out - of - body experience there – where I saw myself leaving Klöden , Evans and Armstrong in the Tour de bloody France .
It did n't feel right .
It was very strange . "
He laughs quietly – but it's a rasping half - laugh , half - cough .
It echoes again later when we walk through central London , and Wiggins talks about feeling so poorly , with his depleted body no longer able to fight the sniffles , sore throat and muscle - eating fatigue that followed his drastic weight - loss and ravaged immune system .
He shed 20 pounds before the Tour started so that he could swap his power on the track for a skeletal lightness in the mountains .
It is just one consequence of his epic tilt at sporting greatness .
" I 've been running at 4 % body fat the last few weeks – and that 's quite dangerous .
I 'm starting to get sick now , a little ill , just from being run down .
I 'm just glad I 'm now free to put a few pounds back on . "
Wiggins is aware of the irony that Simpson rode Ventoux the last time on amphetamines , chased down by brandy , with the drugs costing him his life .
" I 'm sure there were also a few grumbles about me , and suspicions , because I 've come from nowhere .
That 's partly why I released my blood tests for the past two years last week .
The evidence is there for people to see .
My attitude is that if you have nothing to hide why not show it ? "
The Tour 's doping history is so grim that misgivings about others remain .
Do the peloton have doubts in regard to Contador – who proved himself to be on a different level from every other rider in both the mountains and the time - trial ?
" I do n't think so .
I did n't hear any mention of doping on the whole Tour – which is amazing .
I 'm just hoping we do n't get any drug revelations over the next few weeks . "
Yet Greg LeMond , a former three - times winner of the Tour , suggests that Contador 's VO2 max [ his body 's ability to absorb and use oxygen ] must exceed that of any other athlete who has ever lived .
" The burden is on Contador to prove he is physically capable of performing this feat without performance - enhancing products , " LeMond argues .
Contador 's supporters retort that LeMond bases his measurement of VO2 max on flawed data , which fails to take altitude into account .
" I do n't know much about any of that stuff , " Wiggins says , shrugging .
" I just know Contador 's going to be the man to beat for the next five years .
I do n't think there was a big divide between me and Fränk Schleck [ who finished fifth ] and Lance .
There is a gap between me and Contador that will be harder to close .
But who knows how far I can go ?
Coming into this Tour I thought privately that I could make the top 10 – and my only doubt was on the mental side .
I thought I would crack first mentally , rather than physically .
But it 's different now .
" Winning the Tour has to be my goal now .
I would never say , ' OK , this is my goal : to finish third . '
My goal is to win the race .
Logically , I 've got to be in with a real shot .
I was a definite contender this year and I 'm only going to get better .
And Lance is only going to get older … "
The throaty cackle comes again – and Wiggins checks himself briefly .
" But Lance is the only bike rider I 've ever met who has that aura .
He 's like no one else .
But we got on fine because I treat him like a normal person .
It was different between him and [ Armstrong 's team - mate ] Contador .
It got to the point where I would n't have been surprised if they got off their bikes and ended up fighting each other .
Everyone knew there was bad blood and it looks like , reading the war on Twitter between them , it 's not yet over . "
Armstrong is likely to be interested in Cavendish and Wiggins when he finally retires and concentrates on building his own team .
If Cavendish speaks of his awe for Armstrong , Wiggins is more measured .
" It would be interesting to ride for someone like Lance but Andy Schleck is going there .
And after this Tour I 've reached the point where I need to be the leader .
I 've gone up to another level – of Tour contender status – and once people wave chequebooks at you it changes a lot .
I 'm quite happy where I am and I 've had success here .
But we 'll see what happens once my contract [ with Garmin - Slipstream ] ends next year . "
The determination of Dave Brailsford and the British Sky team to entice Wiggins away from Garmin – if not next year then certainly in 2011 – clearly intrigues him .
He praises his current team - mates , especially the previous leader , Christian Vande Velde , who stepped down to support Wiggins , but his relationship with British cycling is so strong that it is hard to imagine him not joining Sky .
" That idea definitely appeals to me .
I 'd like to ride the Tour one day with a British team .
It would be like the track – no detail will be missed .
The Tour is all about detail and this year , because I did n't expect to be in my position , we did n't recce the course or study the climbs .
Contador and Lance , and the Schlecks , checked out the entire course .
They knew the gradients of every climb and when it comes to gear - selection that helps a lot . "
The prospect of Wiggins working with meticulous coaches such as Brailsford and Shane Sutton on future Tours – and fulfilling predictions of a British winner – might be made still more fascinating should Cavendish eventually complete the dream package .
" We did something special this year , me and Cav , " Wiggins says .
" He said he was very proud of me and likewise me of him .
Six stage wins is phenomenal – and he 's now won 10 in two years .
We 're on to something incredible with British cycling .
We 've done it on the track but the medals we won in Beijing felt almost business - like – because it was so expected .
The Tour was more magical . "
Wiggins is in thrall to the Tour , rather than the 2012 Olympics , but feeling hungover and shattered he is still not in a position to make any coherent statement as to how he might balance his new ambition to win the Tour with the old desire for a few more gold medals in his home city .
That decision will only emerge in the coming months , once his head has cleared and his body has recovered .
But on a sunlit morning in London , with his glasses perched on his nose , as he remembers how they played the Sex Pistols 's Pretty Vacant on the team bus every morning – " because that 's exactly how we felt " – Wiggins looks to have shaken the ghost of Ventoux .
" I 'll never forget that day , " he says softly , " because it told me how far I 've come .
This time last month I did n't know what lay in store for me .
I could n't even guess how far I could take this .
But now I know there is much more to come – because I just keep surprising myself . "
Alex Lifeson : new Rush album , tour possible in 2010
[ Rush Might Return in 2010 ]
The one thing that every Rush fan has been wondering about since the band 's 2008 tour came to a close last year is when the band will get to work on a new album .
In his recent Prog interview Alex Lifeson addressed this topic :
... " Tentatively , we start work on the next album in the fall - I did mention it to Ged before he went away on holiday and he sort of looked the other way .
Come September and we 'll certainly have some plans , we did the last record , or we started on the last album in the fall and I 'd like to do that again , start recording maybe .
I do n't know who might produce , that 's some ways off yet . " ...
While this bit of news got a lot of us excited , our excitement was tempered by Lerxst 's use of the word tentatively along with the recent birth of Neil Peart 's new baby .
But Alex addressed the topic yet again and in more detail - including the baby issue - in a recent interview with NoiseCreep.com :
Rush fans take note -- the legendary progressive rock band could be back on the road with a new album in 2010 .
The trio would love to work again with Nick Raskulinecz , who co-produced the last studio album , ' Snakes & Arrows , ' but he 'll have to hang on a bit longer .
" I think Nick calls the office once a week , " laughs guitarist Alex Lifeson , " just to make sure we 're still planning on getting back to work at some point . "
Lifeson , lead singer - bassist Geddy Lee and drummer / lyricist Neil Peart played 120 shows behind ' Snakes & Arrows ' and " were pretty beat by the end of it , " says Lifeson .
" We 'd been working constantly for the last eight years or so , and really needed a break , and decided to take a year off .
We 're sort of coming to the end of that period .
" Neil and his wife had a baby just a couple of weeks ago , so he 's asked if we can just wait a little bit until he gets settled and see how he feels about getting back to work or when to get back to work .
So we 're sort of playing it open right now . "
Lifeson says he 's been doing a little writing at home in Toronto , " just getting myself back into the groove again with recording and stuff like that .
I would guess that sometime in the early fall we would get back together and start writing again , and then hopefully by next summer , we'd be ready to tour . "
This is very encouraging news to say the least .
It 's good to hear Alex address the possibility of a Summer 2010 tour along with the new album .
It also seems very probable that Nick Raskulinecz will once again produce .
The only fly in the ointment seems to be Neil Peart 's understandable unwillingness to get back to work so soon after the birth of his child .
Although despite this ,
Alex still seems to think they 'll be getting into the studio in the early Fall - which would mean late September or October .
Good news indeed .
Thanks to James for the heads up .
ATHEISTS IN THE RAIN
There was the church sign : ATHEISTS HAVE NO INVISIBLE MEANS OF SUPPORT .
I did n’t like it ; I knew it was wrong .
No invisible means of support ?
Then what powers the atheists ?
Their own strength ?
The devil ?
I would not give either the atheist or the devil that kind of credit .
Only the spirit of God causes anything to live and move .
Satan ca n’t create life , and neither can he sustain it ; all is out of God .
The creature certainly cannot will itself into life , or sustain its life day by day .
Scripture says that God causes the rain to fall on the just and the unjust alike .
Rain , in biblical days , was a great blessing .
In an arid land so dependent on agriculture , rain was life .
The presence of it even reflected , to the people , the presence of God .
" He causes His sun to rise on the wicked and the good , and He makes it rain on the just and the unjust .
For if ever you should love those who are loving you , what wages have you ? " ( Mt. 5:45 - 46 ) .
The apostle Paul testified to this truth as well .
Before the philosophers and intellectuals and atheists at Mar ’s Hill , Paul said , " In Him , we are living and moving and are " ( Acts 17:28 ) .
That ’s a big " we " there , and it illustrates a grand truth : even atheists are somehow moving in Christ .
But the church sign knew nothing of this monumental truth because the pastor who erected it loved cleverness more than truth .
No invisible means of support .
Get it ?
Ha , ha .
Good one .
If the goal of the pastor was a clever saying , then the pastor succeeded and my writing is presumptuous .
But if the words were meant to reflect Scriptural truth , then the pastor tumbles into the abyss of human ignorance .
The first dictionary definition of " support " is " to bear or hold up , to sustain . "
We read in Romans 11:36 that " of Him and through Him and to Him are all things . "
This verse is even better in the Amplified version : " All things originate with Him and come from Him ; all things live through Him , and all things center in and tend to consummate and to end in Him . "
The part of the verse I want to emphasize is : " All things live through Him . "
God sustains all creation .
Nothing that lives , lives apart from Him .
What keeps atheists alive ?
Their own wickedness ?
The devil ?
Neither .
God keeps atheists alive , for " all things live through Him . "
Even at the cross , Christ gave breath to the very soldiers who cursed Him .
Such is grace .
Let us never become exclusive by imagining ourselves the only recipients of grace .
Either God sustains and supports atheists , or someone else does .
Either God sustains and supports atheists , or grace fails .
How could grace include everyone but them without losing its essential meaning ?
How could God tell mortal men , " Love your enemies " if He , Himself , is incapable of doing the same ?
Job 8:20 says , " Behold , God will not support evil doers . "
But who said that ?
It was Bildad , the Shuhite , one of Job ’s so - called friends .
But what does God say of the sayings of Bildad ?
Job 42:7 - " The Lord said to Eliphaz the Temanite , ‘ My wrath is kindled against thee , and against thy two friends : for YE HAVE NOT SPOKEN OF ME THE THING THAT IS RIGHT . "
God would say the same thing to the fashioner of the terrible church sign .
I wonder if they know that their doctrine is that of Bildad ?
So we rightly conclude that God supports evildoers .
But then the question arises :
Why does He do that ?
Because , as with Pharaoh , doers of evil help fulfill God ’s purpose .
Proverbs 16:4 - " The Lord hath made all things for Himself : yea , even the wicked for the day of evil . "
Isaiah 54:16 - " I have created the waster to destroy . "
Romans 9:17 - " For the Scripture saith unto Pharaoh , even for this same purpose have I raised thee up , that I might show my power in thee . "
Another dictionary definition of support is " maintenance , as of a person or family . "
One way God raises up
His pharaohs and keeps them there is by supporting them physically .
Thus , " He maketh his sun to rise on the evil and on the good , and sendeth rain on the just and on the unjust , for if ye love them which love you , what reward have ye ? " ( Mt. 5:46 ) .
Obviously , then , God loves and supports atheists .
Why did the sign contradict that truth ?
( Hint : it was a church sign . )
Another definition of support , and I quote directly from the Random House Collegiate dictionary : " To endure with patience . "
Startling it will be for some to learn that these are the exact words Paul uses concerning the wicked in Romans 9:22 .
From the New American Standard Bible : " What if God , although willing to demonstrate His wrath and to make His power known , endured with much patience vessels of wrath prepared for destruction ? "
But according to this church sign , God endures ( or supports ) them not .
As for atheists , they are no different than we once were .
We came to God , not of our own initiative , but because of Christ ’s spirit .
We came because He first loved and called us ( 1 Jn. 4:10 , Jn. 6:44 ) .
He will one day call atheists , too , because
His love is the selfless kind that does not rest until it seeks and saves the last lost sheep ( Mt. 18:12 , 1 Tim .
1:15 , Is. 45:23 , 1Cor. 15:25 ) .
The blood of Christ ’s cross is the most effective prescription for all enmity , either on earth or in heaven ( Col. 1:20 ) .
Remember , " God locks up all in stubbornness that He should be merciful to all " ( Rom. 11:32 ) .
Let Scriptural truth , not clever phraseology , guide our church sign erectors , not that I have any real hope of this happening .
It will never happen in this eon—unless , that is , I start a church .
Now there ’s an idea .
The message on my church sign would teem with life and Scriptural truth .
My message would stop people in their tracks ( or in their cars ) , and probably cause several accidents .
It would be a message so simple , so true , so resplendent with the wisdom , grace and mercy of God , that none but the scripturally ignorant and proud of heart would attempt to refute it .
My church sign would read :
GOD LOVES ATHEISTS , TOO .
The Russian government owes it not just to foreign countries but to the Russian people themselves to examine and discuss these crimes , since ( quite unlike in the case of the Nazis ) such a high proportion of Stalin ’s victims were ethnic Russians or inhabitants of what is now the Russian Federation .
This is the crux of what I take to be a fair judgment on the present dispute over 1939 .
It is that Vladimir Putin is basically correct in his judgment on the strategic calculations of that year , but badly at fault in his judgment of the political systems of the time .
The Polish president , Lech Kaczynski , apologized this month for Poland ’s role in Hitler ’s partition of Czechoslovakia , stating that , “ Poland ’s participation in the annexation of Czechoslovakia in 1938 was not only an error , but above all a sin . ”
He should have added that this built on an earlier criminal error , that of Poland ’s nonaggression pact with Nazi Germany in 1934 , which effectively demolished France ’s alliance system in Eastern Europe , and made it much harder to prevent Nazi Germany ’s expansion in the mid-1930s .
As for Britain and France , there have been frequent public acknowledgments of the obvious fact that not merely did they not fight for Czechoslovakia in 1938 , but that although they declared war on Germany when Hitler attacked Poland in September 1939 , they did virtually nothing to help Poland militarily .
Allied action on the Western front during Hitler ’s conquest of Poland was derisory .
In Britain ’s case it could not have been anything else , since at that stage Britain had only three divisions fully equipped and prepared to fight on the Continent .
This leads to the question :
If Stalin had declared war or risked war with Germany in 1939 , and Hitler had extended his attack on Poland to an invasion of the Soviet Union , what would Britain and France have done to help ?
The answer is blindingly obvious :
Just what they did to help Poland — nothing .
As for the United States , its own absence in 1939 does not allow its representatives any right to take any position on these issues .
Mr. Putin and other Russian representatives are perfectly entitled to point this out .
In the case of a Soviet - German war in 1939 , an additional factor would have been at play , which was the openly expressed desire of some conservative circles in both Britain and France for a war between Nazism and Communism that would destroy both .
The anti-social nature of the diatribe was stunning .
Service , according to the gospel of Limbaugh , is for suckers , for society 's " losers , " for people who have committed crimes .
In other words , it should be viewed as punishment rather than as something to be applauded and encouraged .
To do for community is a fool 's errand .
Yet as bizarre as his words may seem at first blush , they actually illustrate with bold clarity the fundamental ( and increasingly common ) core of the conservative belief system .
They speak to the sociopathy that is at the heart of the far - right worldview .
It is a worldview that holds , quite simply , that doing for others is contemptible ; that doing for self is the purpose of human life ; that altruism and service are somehow pathologies pushed by collectivists and should be subordinated to selfishness and greed .
Sound too extreme ?
Well if so , consider this .
Among the most interesting phenomena of the past year -- and especially since the inauguration of Barack Obama - - has been the explosion of interest in ( and sales of ) books by the late author , Ayn Rand : most prominently her classic novels , The Fountainhead and Atlas Shrugged .
Indeed , the latter had an all - time record year in 2008 , and 2009 sales are on a pace to shatter even last year 's numbers .
Far from a simple believer in limited government and a free market economy , Rand 's philosophy -- now being endorsed by tea party protesters and anti-Obama minions across the nation ( indeed the Ayn Rand Center for Individual Rights was among the sponsors of the 9/12 march on Washington ) -- was predicated on one overarching notion : that a commitment to selfishness and a rejection of altruistic behavior were the height of morality .
That 's not to say that she merely rejected compulsory altruism via taxation , but altruism even privately chosen .
To do for others , out of a charitable impulse or out of some faith - based commitment , for example , is morally and ethically suspect , for neither feelings nor faith are rational bases for human actions , according to her philosophy known as Objectivism .
Unless one 's assistance to another were rooted in some self - interested motivation , it was to be condemned .
It is especially fascinating to see the so - called " average , everyday folks " at the tea party rallies embracing Rand 's thinking and literature .
After all , Rand 's view of the common man and woman -- presumably the very Joe Six Packs and Hockey Moms recently enthralled by her - - was decidedly grotesque .
So , for instance , in her original version of her work , We the Living , Rand had her chief protagonist proclaim : " What are your masses ... but mud to be ground underfoot , fuel to be burned for those who deserve it ? "
Rand 's disdain for the bulk of humanity was , indeed , so extreme that in the aforemetioned Atlas Shrugged -- whose main character and " hero " John Galt has been referenced on numerous tea party signs -- she indulges a pseudo - genocidal fantasy , in which virtually everyone except Galt and his few " perfect " producers is vanquished .
This happy occurrence results from a " strike of the mind , " in which Galt and his superior colleagues of industry withdraw their talents from the nation and hole up in a mountain retreat , rather than submit to things like government regulations .
Those whom Galt condemns in the book , and thus , whom Rand is herself condemning , are referred to as " parasites " who are unworthy of life .
Indeed , Galt 's contempt for the weak of the world prompts he and his colleagues to banish the word " give " from their small utopian " gulch . "
Giving , after all , much like calls for community service , is for suckers .
Even though Galt feels certain that his strike may well kill the vast majority of the world 's inhabitants ( because they are simply too stupid to survive without he and the other " perfect producers " ) , he firmly believes , and thus , so does Rand , that this outcome is moral -- more so , than say , taxes or charity .
In keeping with his strange morality , he not only withdraws his superior talent , but also sabotages the nation 's infrastructure ( the roads and bridges ) thereby making the transport of fuel and grain impossible , resulting in chaos , starvation and general suffering .
This is what the Rand - bots are reading , the vision of society they endorse : one comprised of better people , and decided inferiors , sub - humans even , who are worthy of death for their laziness , their sloth , their lack of industriousness .
No wonder people imbued with such a truly sadistic mindset as this would oppose health care reform .
To this way of thought , those without health care deserve their suffering , and that suffering should be of no concern to the rest of us .
Those who have written biographies of Rand - - including former acolytes -- paint a uniformly disturbing picture .
Rand , according to Nathaniel Branden 's My Years with Ayn Rand , Barbara Branden 's The Passion of Ayn Rand , and Jeff Walker 's The Ayn Rand Cult was narcissistic in the extreme , incapable of empathy , often cruel - - going so far as to have an affair in full view of her husband -- as well as paranoid , addicted to amphetamines , and obsessed with her belief that average people were " ugly , stupid and irrational . "
Interestingly , despite her general disdain for humanity , there were people she seemed to admire greatly , such as William Edward Hickman , whose credo , " What is good for me is right , " she described in her Journals as , " The best and strongest expression of a real man 's psychology I have heard . "
But Hickman was no simple expositor of personal greed and self - interest ; no mere modern day libertarian ; no pedestrian practitioner of excessive self - love .
No indeed .
He was a sociopathic murderer .
In 1927 he kidnapped a 12 - year old girl from a school in Los Angeles by the name of Marian Parker , chopped off her legs , cut our her internal organs , drained all of her blood and then spread parts of her body all over the city .
Of Hickman , this sick murderer , Rand had almost nothing but positive things to say .
She indeed critiqued those who would condemn Hickman 's actions for having committed " worse sins and crimes , " such as those she ascribed to his jury .
Among those " greater " crimes -- greater than mutilating a child -- she included being , " Average , everyday , rather stupid looking citizens .
Shabbily dressed , dried , worn looking little men .
Fat , overdressed , very average , ' dignified ' housewives . "
Their ordinariness , in other words , placed them below Hickman , in Rand 's mind .
" How can they decide the fate of that boy ?
Or anyone 's fate ? " she implored in her Journals .
It was Hickman 's willfulness , his disregard for others , which so seems to have resonated with Rand .
It fit perfectly with her own developing philosophy , which she would articulate perfectly in her original notes for The Fountainhead , wherein she wrote , " One puts oneself above all and crushes everything in one 's way to get the best for oneself .
Fine ! "
Thus Hickman 's crime , to Rand , was " a daring challenge to society , " rather than the act of a seriously deranged person from whom the society should seek protection .
Indeed , Rand speculates that Hickman 's real crime may have been merely that he was " too impatient , fiery and proud " to accept the slow , soul - crushing death that his life had become .
She even went so far as to blame the crime on Christianity , which she described as " ludicrous tragic nonsense , " capable of turning this " bad boy with a very winning grin , that ... makes you like him the whole time you 're in his presence " into a sadistic killer .
And so , interestingly , the right is increasingly cleaving to the words and philosophy of a woman who was not only , in all likelihood , mentally disturbed , but the functional equivalent of those who fell in love with say , Charles Manson or Ted Bundy , even after their crimes were exposed .
This is what the right is coming to .
This is what they really mean when they call themselves " values voters . "
The values of which they speak , far from being " Christian , " and far from being rooted in concern for the country , are -- at least for many -- firmly grounded in selfishness , applied narcissism and operationalized , organizational sociopathy .
That they would seek to make a hero of Rand , and forge a movement based even in part on her thinking is all the evidence one should need that the patients are running the asylum known as the American right .
Only , their kind of craziness is not nearly as sympathetic as that displayed by the typical person suffering from mental illness .
Theirs is a special kind of crazy , not organic as is the case with so much mental illness , but rather , rooted in anti-social , almost cult - like propaganda .
Sadly , it is a propaganda that , even with its horrific message is currently being read by more than a million high school students across the country : probably more than a few of whom are the very ones whose principals and teachers , or parents , refused to let them hear the President speak for fear he might indoctrinate them into such awful projects as community service ( or , as it turned out , merely staying in school ) .
They want their country back , they tell us .
And the country they want , so far as their reading habits would suggest , is a nation based on greed , me - firstism and an utter disregard for the well - being of the community .
As for me , I will gladly stand with the opposite tradition .
Do we want a culture of compassion or contempt ?
That is the choice .
And we should proclaim our answer , compassion , boldly and without apology .

Scribblenauts was the darling of E3 , rounding up a hojillion awards — including a Golden Ars — and impressing everyone who stopped by for a demo .
It was a game that showed very well , especially with a developer on hand to point out any number of interesting situations .
The premise is simple , although it hides an abyssal depth : you are asked to either reach a star , or to fulfill the requirements to earn one .
The tools at your disposal ?

You can type in or write any word you can think of , and get that item or person to help you in your quest .
No dirty words , and no proper nouns , nothing copyrighted — but even without those limitations , you 're looking at tens of thousands of items .
Type in " pirate " to fight a ninja .
Type in " bridge " to cross an expanse , or type in " motorcycle " and " ramp " and jump it .
You gain currency by using fewer items , and also by using creative solutions , and you use that currency to unlock new worlds .
There are two types of levels : action levels where you simply have to get to the starite item , using your reflexes as well as your wits ; and puzzle , where you are given a one - sentence instruction about what to do .
It may say " get rid of the rats , " and in that sentence are dozens of possibilities .
In fact , you only completely clear out a level by finishing it three times , without using any item more than once .
Much harder than it sounds .
The controls are way more twitchy than they need to be , and will often lead to frustrating deaths .
You can attach items to each other , but the physics are weird .
If you miss the connection points — say , between a jet and a chain — things can get odd as the jet does a few flips for no reason .
If you try to hold a chain that 's jumping for some reason and miss it ?
Your character thinks you 're telling him to move , which is bad news when you 're surrounded by lava .
You 'll often find yourself calling shenanigans on some of the interactions .
At one point I had to fight a dragon .
A knight and a superhero were both offed by the beast .
A bazooka round ?
No effect .
A sniper rife ?
Nothing .
A bomb ?
Did n't faze him .
If you put a wall in front of a moving character they 'll often just knock it over instead of being stopped by it .
When I tried to fish a piranha out of a moat , it simply jumped over to where I was standing and ate me .
Why would my spawned superhero kill a knight that was apparently guarding a castle , and cause me to fail the level ?
I know the gunshots will scare the sheep , but " silencer " is n't an item in the game ?
Bah !
This is a frustrating , often maddening game .
When you find the answer to a puzzle that has been giving you trouble it's a great feeling , but it 's often overshadowed by attempts that make perfect sense , but simply do n't work .
The difficulty level is often wildly uneven , although that will probably differ depending on each individual .
I found some puzzles way too easy ; others nearly impossible .
One level simply placed a tornado in your path and asked you to get past it .
Sounds simple , but the weatherman did n't know what to do , it threw my truck like it was nothing , God did n't seem to want to help , but I 'll be damned if a ( SPOILER ) did n't take care of it right quick .
The good news is that with the in - game currency system ( called " ollars " ) you earn money by solving each puzzle well , and you do n't need to finish every puzzle in every world to move forward .
If you 're stuck on a level or puzzle , move on to another one , and let your brain work on it while you 're away from the game .
I often thought of new solutions or ideas while I was supposed to be thinking of something else .
This is a game that will monopolize your brain cycles .
My advice ?
Find a child to play with .
While adults can easily get stuck in the same ruts while thinking about solutions to puzzles — I usually used a jet pack or wings to get where I was going — children seem to have no problem throwing solution after solution at problems .
When a game actively rewards the thinking of children over that of adults , we 're on to something special .
Conclusions
The game also gives you the ability to create your own levels , and this process is just as intuitive as the main gameplay .
You create an item , place it , attach it to others , use the game 's simple scripting language to set up relationships , write your own hints , and pick music .
In seconds I was able to make Death scared of both Priests and Doctors , and after that my mind started to really go .

You wo n't be able to stir every hornet 's nest , however — I could n't find " Bible " as an object in the game .
If you 'll excuse a quick lecture :
There is a leaked copy of the game out there now , and I 'm sure everyone here knows where to look .
Our own forum has more than a few people offering up impressions from the pirated copy of the game .
I hope those who decided to treat themselves to a sneak preview decide to buy now that the game is available .
For the few issues the game has , this is something undeniably new and impressive .
We need to support developers and publishers who go out on a limb and create something fresh with our money .
Do the industry a favor and buy if you liked it .

Ben 's reading has improved Ben Osborne - Harris is a bright teenager , who has sat two of his GCSEs a year earlier than normal .
But just a couple of years ago , the 13 - year - old London schoolboy was struggling badly - because he could not read properly .
" He just found it incredibly difficult to grasp reading at school , " said his mother Gaynor .
" His reading age was well below average .
When he got homework I had to help him read it and when he sat his Sats tests at 11 ( in English , maths and science ) he had to have someone read the questions to him .
Coloured filters " I initially thought he was dyslexic and took him to be tested but , because he could not read very well , the test did not work and they could not determine whether he was or was not . "
On a routine visit to the optometrist she mentioned the problem and they suggested testing Ben for a condition called scotopic sensitivity , a type of visual disturbance , which can easily be overcome or dramatically improved with the simple use of coloured filters .
It 's tragic but true that many children struggle unnecessarily at school
Prakash Rughani
It worked , and Ben has leapt ahead taking parts of his drama and maths GCSE exams a year early .
London optometrist Prakash Rughani , who treated Ben , said scotopic sensitivity is thought to affect half of all children with learning difficulties , amounting to around a million children in the UK .
Testing is available at a number of optometrist clinics throughout the UK , but not on the NHS and needs to be funded privately .
The cost of the checks and coloured glasses , if needed , is around £ 150 - £ 175 .
Mr Rughani said the treatment can also help with another eye condition , visual stress , that can also slow progress at school .
" This is essentially hyperactivity of the brain , resulting in visual disturbances and headaches which may cause problems with reading .
" In this case , the colour tints help by making the brain relax .
" The patients are unaware , because they have nothing to compare with that they have these difficulties , but it stops them from reading efficiently , " he said .
' It 's tragic but true that many children struggle unnecessarily at school . "
Missing treatments
Mr Rughani said many children who could benefit from this treatment are not doing so , because it is not being picked up .
" We get patients all the time who do n't know this sort of help is available from their optometrist . "
Ben gets called Elton John because of his coloured glasses Mr Rughani , of Visioncare Medical Eye Centre , said colorimetry testing can bring about a dramatic improvement .
' Different people 's eyes respond to the varying wavelengths produced by different colours .
" If an initial ' rate of reading ' investigation suggests that a child may benefit from colorimetry , we will dispense a colour overlay or for them to try , " he said .
Over 100,000 tints are on offer and they can be fitted into glasses if found to be useful .
Gaynor said she believed the colour filters had made a difference to her son 's vision .
" The improvement in his education was staggering .
" ' Now can do his homework unaided and is so much happier , even with the rest of his GCSEs looming ! '
" I do n't think I will ever be able to say for definite it was because of the colours , but it is a reasonable coincidence .
And if I did n't think it made a difference to his reading I would n't keep paying for the glasses . "
Colour shades " Ben says he still notices a difference .
" He said the words were a bit clearer with the colours .
They call him Elton John at school because of the different colours in his glasses .
" He has had them in rose pink and bright green - now deep blue so the needs do keep changing .
" It does make me wonder whether there are other children this might help with . "
Dr Susan Blakeney , optometric adviser for the College of Optometrists agreed that studies have shown that the filters may benefit some pupils with learning difficulties .
But she added : " The patient should make certain that they have had a thorough eye examination to ensure that there are no other problems which may be contributing to difficulties reading . "

No one aspires to be phony , or hang out in a relationship where they can't be real .
Surely no amount of pretending can substitute for connections to caring people with whom you can deepen and refine the truths you tell about yourself over time .
But it 's also true that moping around and feeling sorry for yourself - although it may be absolutely necessary at a particular time - can lead to more of the same .
And simply smiling can help .
The Buddhist monk Thich Nhat Hanh , a and peace activist , encourage us to smile often and notes that the act of smiling relaxed the muscles of the face and has many benefits .
His work has inspired many people to smile as part of a spiritual practice .
Sometimes I encourage my clients to engage in creative acts of pretending , not to run from the truth , but rather to discover new truths .
Pretending joy or can be a self - fulfilling prophecy , helping us discover or enhance our capacity for these positive feelings .
Consider doing an experiment for ten days .
Pretend that you feel fine , even happy .
Observe the results of your own experiment .
You 'll see if you ultimately feel a greater sense of zest and more empowered to act on your own behalf - or not .
P.S. If you 're a person who always appears to have it together , and who does n't share problems or vulnerability , ignore this advice .
You may need to experiment with the opposite .
Authenticiy and good self - esteem requires that we can share our strengths and competence and our vulnerabilities and weaknesses ( we all have both ) in a balanced way .
NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- Guaranty Bank was closed by federal regulators Friday in the third largest bank failure this year bringing the total number of failures to 81 in 2009 .
The Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation was named receiver of the Austin , TX - based thrift , which had approximately $ 13 billion in assets and $ 12 billion in deposits as of June .
BBVA Compass , a U.S. subsidiary of Spanish bank Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria , agreed to assume all of Guaranty 's deposits and will buy $ 12 billion of its assets .
The FDIC said it would share losses on $ 11 billion of the failed bank 's assets .
The 162 branches that Guaranty operated in Texas and California will reopen Monday as branches of BBVA Compass , which is based in Birmingham , Ala .
Guaranty was the third largest bank to fail in 2009 .
It tied for the title of 11th largest bank failure in U.S. history with First City Bancorporation , which failed in 1988 .
The estimated cost of Guaranty 's failure to the FDIC is $ 3 billion .
BBVA ( BBV ) emerged as the winning bidder for Guaranty 's assets , beating out potential buyers including a private equity group led by investor Gerald Ford .
Jose Maria Garcia Meyer , chairman of BBVA Compass , in a statement said the transaction makes " excellent strategic sense " and represents an opportunity for BBVA to expand its presence in the " high growth Sunbelt Region . "
The purchase marks the first time an overseas - based bank has bought a failed U.S. bank this year .
However , the Bilbao - based bank made a series of acquisitions in Texas earlier this decade and already operates the fourth - biggest banking chain in the state by deposits .
Most of this year 's failures have been small , regional banks that were brought down by rising delinquencies on home and other consumer loans as unemployment has risen to a 25 - year high in one of the longest recessions on record .
Guaranty , which was the fourth Texas bank to fail this year , had a substantial number of risky mortgages made to California borrowers on its books .
These loans became a severe liability as the housing market in California collapsed and borrowers defaulted in droves .
Option adjustable rate mortgages made up almost a third of Guaranty 's single family mortgage portfolio , according to investor presentations on its Web site .
Guaranty also had $ 1.2 billion of loans to homebuilders in California 's overbuilt market .
BBVA said it will maintain regulatory capital ratios at a level that exceeds " well - capitalized " guidelines , and that the impact of transaction will be " immaterial " to BBVA .
California 's housing woes also played a major role in last year 's failures of Washington Mutual and IndyMac .
WaMu , which had $ 307 billion in assets , was the largest U.S. bank failure on record .
Three other banks fail
Earlier in the day , regulators closed Birmingham , Ala . - based CapitalSouth Bank , which operated ten branches and had $ 617 million in assets and deposits of about $ 546 million .
Iberiabank , which is based in Lafayette , La , will assume all of the CapitalSouth 's deposits and will purchase $ 589 million of its assets .
In Georgia , regulators closed Newnan - based First Coweta and arranged for United Bank , of Zebulon , to take over its four branches .
United Bank will pay the FDIC a premium of 1 % to assume all of the First Coweta 's $ 155 million in deposits and will buy $ 155 million of its assets .
Georgia regulators also closed the sole branch of Atlanta - based ebank , which will reopen on Monday as a branch of Stearns Bank .
St. Cloud , Minn. - based Stearns , which has bought a number of failed banks this year , will purchase the bulk of the failed bank 's $ 143 million in assets and will assume all of its $ 130 million in deposits .
So far this year , 18 banks have failed in Georgia .
Friday 's closure brings the total number of bank failures this year to 81 , compared with a total of 25 in all of 2008 .
The failures of CapitalSouth , First Coweta and ebank will cost the FDIC an estimated $ 262 million on top of the $ 3 billion from the failure of Guaranty Bank .
Over the next five years , the agency expects roughly $ 70 billion in losses due to the failure of insured institutions .
Fortune 's Colin Barr contributed to this report .
A total of 166 people died in the attacks in Mumbai in November 2008 India and Pakistan will work together to fight terrorism , the countries ' prime ministers have announced .
Meeting in Egypt , they said the fight against their " main threat " should not be linked to wider peace talks .
However , India 's Manmohan Singh later said no dialogue would start until those behind last year 's attacks in Mumbai ( Bombay ) were " brought to book " .
Relations between the two countries deteriorated after the attacks in which militants killed more than 160 people .
India has accused Pakistan - based fighters from the banned militant group Lashkar - e - Taiba of carrying out the attacks .
Pakistan has admitted they were partly planned on its soil - and vowed to do all it can to bring the suspects to justice .
Climb - down ' denied ' ANALYSIS Jill McGivering , BBC News
Broadly speaking the prime ministers emerged in positive mood .
Both sides found agreement on some basic principles .
Crucially , they also agreed to separate their debate about action on terrorism from more general dialogue .
That was a key demand from Pakistan - and may make it possible for the mechanism of talks to be revived , independent of India 's continuing demands for tougher action on militant groups like Lashkar - e - Taiba , the group India blames for the Mumbai attacks .
That apparent concession from India was offset by some tough statements on terrorism .
Mr Singh has to face an Indian public which is still angry about the Mumbai attacks and frustrated that , so far , Pakistan has done little to convict those responsible .
Prime Ministers Yousuf Raza Gilani of Pakistan and Manmohan Singh of India made the pledge after meeting in Egypt .
The talks on Thursday - on the sidelines of the Non-Aligned Movement 's summit in Egypt - were the third high - level meeting between the two nuclear - armed neighbours since the Mumbai attacks last November which brought an abrupt halt to peace talks .
" Both leaders affirmed their resolve to fight terrorism and co-operate with each other to this end , " the joint statement of the talks said .
" Prime Minister Singh reiterated the need to bring the perpetrators of the Mumbai attacks to justice and Prime Minister Gilani assured that Pakistan will do everything in its power in this regard . "
The two prime ministers agreed to co-operate on the investigation .
Both leaders agreed that terrorism is the main threat to both countries
Joint statement
Full text : India - Pakistan statement Breaking the ice ?
" Pakistan has provided an updated status dossier on the investigations of the Mumbai attacks , " their statement said .
The two leaders also agreed to " share real - time , credible and actionable information on any future terrorist threat " .
Last week Pakistan said the trial of five men suspected of involvement in the attack on Mumbai's Taj Hotel was likely to start this week .
In a move likely to please Islamabad , the prime minister 's joint statement said action on terrorism " should not be linked to the composite dialogue process " - which includes talks on the disputed territory of Kashmir .
The BBC's Sanjoy Majumder in Delhi says many in India will see this as a major climb - down in Delhi 's stance .
And moments after the joint statement had been issued , Mr Singh appeared to contradict the joint statement .
He told a news conference dialogue " cannot begin unless and until terrorist heads which shook Mumbai are properly accounted for , ( the ) perpetrators of these heinous crimes are brought to book " .

Notre devoir d’infirmières est d’informer correctement la population , pour que chacun prenne sa décision en toute connaissance de cause , par un consentement libre et éclairé , et non par une campagne de publicité et des discours alarmistes .
Le vaccin sans adjuvant est sûr , ceux avec adjuvants relèvent du " bénéfice - risque " individuel en fonction de l’état de santé personnel et du contexte familial .
Le syn­di­cat des infir­miè­res SNPI CFE - CGC estime qu’une vac­ci­na­tion mas­sive contre un virus grip­pal rela­ti­ve­ment bénin , pré­sente des ris­ques , du fait d’un vaccin déve­loppé trop rapi­de­ment , et d’un adju­vant sus­cep­ti­ble de déclen­cher des mala­dies auto - immu­nes .
Aussi a t-il pris posi­tion par un com­mu­ni­qué du 1er sep­tem­bre 2009 :
Nous invi­tons la popu­la­tion à se vac­ci­ner contre la grippe sai­son­nière : ce vaccin ( réa­lisé dans des condi­tions nor­ma­les ) per­met­tra de réa­li­ser rapi­de­ment un diag­nos­tic dif­fé­ren­tiel en cas de syn­drome grip­pal .
Par contre , chacun doit bien mesu­rer le rap­port béné­fice / ris­ques du vaccin H1N1 avec adju­vant : d’un côté une semaine de grippe , de l’autre une pro­ba­bi­lité , faible mais défi­ni­tive , d’avoir une mala­die neu­ro­lo­gi­que ( Syndrome Guillain - Barré ) ou auto - immune .
Comme nos col­lè­gues infir­miè­res de Grande Bretagne et de Hong Kong , nous crai­gnons que le remède risque d’être pire que le mal , et nous pen­sons qu’il faut savoir " raison garder " .
La pan­dé­mie peut causer une crise économique , et l’Etat s’est très bien orga­nisé pour y faire face ( conseils d’hygiène , mas­ques , Tamiflu ) .
" Mais injec­ter 94 mil­lions de doses d’un pro­duit sur lequel nous n’avons aucun recul peut poser un pro­blème de santé publi­que , et il est de notre devoir d’infir­miè­res d’infor­mer cor­rec­te­ment la popu­la­tion , pour que chacun prenne sa déci­sion en toute connais­sance de cause , par un consen­te­ment libre et éclairé , et non par une cam­pa­gne de publi­cité et des dis­cours alar­mis­tes " sou­li­gne Thierry Amouroux , le Secrétaire Général du SNPI , le Syndicat National des Professionnels Infirmiers .
Le virus H5N1 , res­pon­sa­ble de la grippe aviaire , pos­sé­dait une viru­lence très élevée ( le taux de mor­ta­lité a atteint 60 % ) cou­plée à une conta­gio­sité chez les humains très faible ( quel­ques mil­liers de cas sur l’ensem­ble de la pla­nète ) .
Le H1N1 est pra­ti­que­ment l’inverse : il est très conta­gieux mais fai­ble­ment agres­sif : en France , peu de morts et de cas graves com­pa­ra­ti­ve­ment au 4 à 6.000 morts fran­çais de la grippe sai­son­nière par an !

Selon le comité inter­mi­nis­té­riel de crise réuni jeudi 27 août 2009 , pour faire le point sur l’épidémie de Grippe A : «
Les inconnues sub­sis­tant encore concer­nent : la date de livrai­son des vac­cins par les indus­triels , la date d’AMM ainsi que son péri­mè­tre ( adul­tes , enfants , femmes encein­tes … ) , la défi­ni­tion pré­cise des per­son­nes à ris­ques et le taux de léta­lité du virus de la grippe A( H1N1 ) . »
Les décès lors d’une grippe sai­son­nière sont géné­ra­le­ment liés à des décom­pen­sa­tions de patho­lo­gies chro­ni­ques et des surin­fec­tions bac­té­rien­nes , or rien ne permet d’affir­mer aujourd ’hui que ces com­pli­ca­tions indi­rec­tes seront plus fré­quen­tes avec la grippe A ( H1N1 ) .
Risque de Syndrome Guillain - Barré SGB
Le syn­drome de Guillain et Barré est une sorte de para­ly­sie ascen­dante qui débute aux mem­bres infé­rieurs pour monter pro­gres­si­ve­ment .
Dans les formes graves elle peut se com­pli­quer de para­ly­sie des mus­cles res­pi­ra­toi­res et la per­sonne atteinte devra alors être placée sous res­pi­ra­teur arti­fi­ciel .
La para­ly­sie peut être irré­ver­si­ble .
Comment peut - on éviter une répé­ti­tion des com­pli­ca­tions ren­contrées en 1976 aux États - Unis d’Amérique avec le vaccin contre la grippe por­cine ?
46 mil­lions de per­son­nes avaient été vac­ci­nées , et envi­ron 4.000 d’entre elles ont porté plainte par la suite pour effets secondai­res graves .
Selon l’OMS
" Des études lais­sent à penser que la vac­ci­na­tion régu­lière contre la grippe sai­son­nière pour­rait être asso­ciée à une aug­men­ta­tion du risque de syn­drome de Guillain - Barré de l’ordre d’un à deux cas par mil­lion de per­son­nes vac­ci­nées .
Pendant la cam­pa­gne de vac­ci­na­tion anti­grip­pale de 1976 , ce risque a aug­menté pour attein­dre envi­ron dix cas par mil­lion de per­son­nes vac­ci­nées , ce qui a conduit à un retrait du vaccin . "

Un vaccin contre la grippe por­cine a de nou­veau été asso­cié à une aug­men­ta­tion du risque de SGB en 1993 - 1994 .
Les Américains avaient alors enre­gis­tré 74 cas de SGB en 1994 , en forte hausse sur 1993 ( 37 cas ) .
" Nous sommes tout à fait cons­cients du risque lié à la sur­ve­nue de cas de Guillain - Barré chez les sujets vac­ci­nés contre la grippe , expli­que Carmen Kreft - Jaïs , res­pon­sa­ble de la phar­ma­co­vi­gi­lance à l ’Agence fran­çaise de sécu­rité sani­taire des pro­duits de santé ( Afssaps ) dans un arti­cle du Monde du 20.08.09 .
Nous sui­vrons atten­ti­ve­ment l’évolution du nombre de Guillain - Barré en cas de pan­dé­mie et de vac­ci­na­tion mas­sive . "

Des pro­cé­du­res régle­men­tai­res spé­ci­fi­ques ont été conçues pour accé­lé­rer l’homo­lo­ga­tion des vac­cins contre la grippe pan­dé­mi­que .
Selon l’OMS , " des ques­tions spé­ci­fi­ques , à propos de l ’inno­cuité des vac­cins contre une grippe pan­dé­mi­que , se posent iné­vi­ta­ble­ment quand on com­mence à les admi­nis­trer à grande échelle .
Par exem­ple , des événements indé­si­ra­bles , trop rares pour être mis en évidence même au cours d’essais cli­ni­ques de grande ampleur , peu­vent appa­raî­tre lors­que la vac­ci­na­tion concerne des popu­la­tions très nom­breu­ses .
Toujours selon l’OMS , " par manque de temps , les don­nées cli­ni­ques seront iné­vi­ta­ble­ment limi­tées au moment où on com­men­cera à admi­nis­trer les vac­cins contre la grippe pan­dé­mi­que .
Les tests d’inno­cuité et d’effi­ca­cité devront donc se pour­sui­vre après avoir com­mencé à les admi­nis­trer " .
Pour toutes ces rai­sons , l’OMS conseille à tous les pays qui admi­nis­tre­ront des vac­cins contre la grippe pan­dé­mi­que de sur­veiller atten­ti­ve­ment leur inno­cuité et leur effi­ca­cité

Problèmes de l’adju­vant du vaccin H1N1
Un adju­vant est une sub­stance chi­mi­que qui est uti­li­sée pour rendre le vaccin plus effi­cace et qui peut per­met­tre d’uti­li­ser une dose d’anti­gè­nes plus faible .
La ques­tion est de savoir l’impact que pour­rait avoir un nouvel adju­vant sur les mala­dies auto - immu­nes qui sont jus­te­ment cau­sées par un dérè­gle­ment du sys­tème immu­ni­taire .
Un adju­vant , le AS03 uti­lisé pour le vaccin pré­paré par GlaxoSmithKline ( GSK ) , permet d’uti­li­ser de très fai­bles doses d’anti­gène , mul­ti­pliant ainsi le nombre de doses pos­si­bles .
Le sys­tème de sur­veillance qui sera en place devra garan­tir que les per­son­nes qui ont une mala­die auto - immune ( dia­bète , hypo­thy­roi­die , arthrite , sclé­rose en pla­ques , etc. ) ne ver­ront pas leur pro­blè­mes s’aggra­ver .
Le vaccin H1N1 contient 4 fois moins d’anti­gène ( pour accé­lé­rer la pro­duc­tion , vu les quan­ti­tés à pro­duire rapi­de­ment ) grâce à la pré­sence de l’adju­vant AS03 , un ampli­fi­ca­teur d’effet qui consiste en un mélange de squa­lène et de poly­sor­bate .
Un tel adju­vant n’a jamais été uti­lisé aupa­ra­vant dans un vaccin com­mer­cia­lisé à large échelle , et peut donc déclen­cher des réac­tions immu­ni­tai­res exces­si­ves et aug­men­ter la pro­ba­bi­lité et la fré­quence d’effets secondai­res rares , mais graves et dan­ge­reux , tels que le syn­drome de Guillain - Barré .
Les addi­tifs et adju­vants peu­vent influen­cer la sécu­rité des vac­cins de façon com­plè­te­ment impré­vi­si­ble , comme on l’a vu par exem­ple avec le vaccin anti-méningo - enché­pha­lite à tiques TICOVAC , qui a dû être retiré du marché en 2001 , 14 mois à peine après son lan­ce­ment , pour cause d’effets secondai­res graves et fré­quents .
La com­po­si­tion du Ticovac ne dif­fé­rait de celle de son pré­dé­ces­seur que par deux addi­tifs qui ont été éliminés depuis : l’albu­mine et un conser­va­teur conte­nant du mer­cure .
En consé­quence le pro­duit est inter­dit en Allemagne , et en France la poso­lo­gie a été réduite de moitié , et l’indi­ca­tion a été reti­rée chez les enfants de moins de 3 ans .
( détails dans les conclu­sions de la Commission de la trans­pa­rence de la Haute Autorité de Santé : http://www.has-sante.fr/por­tail/upload/docs/appli­ca­tion/pdf/ct010156.pdf)
Pourquoi ne pas conti­nuer à miser sur les métho­des de pro­duc­tion conven­tion­nel­les et éprouvées par les décen­nies d’expé­rience des vac­cins contre la grippe sai­son­nière ?
Car , contrai­re­ment à ces vac­cins clas­si­ques , l’uti­li­sa­tion mas­sive de vac­cins nou­veaux conte­nant des sub­stan­ces qui ren­for­cent la réponse immu­ni­taire pose des pro­blè­mes :
Notre expé­rience et nos connais­san­ces des adju­vants ampli­fi­ca­teurs de la réponse immu­ni­taire sont très fai­bles , et chaque firme phar­ma­ceu­ti­que uti­lise ses pro­pres mélan­ges , dont elle détient les bre­vets .
Le pas­sage des essais cli­ni­ques à l’admi­nis­tra­tion sys­té­ma­ti­que est une phase par­ti­cu­liè­re­ment sen­si­ble dans l’uti­li­sa­tion des médi­ca­ments .
S’il a des effets secondai­res inat­ten­dus , ceux - ci peu­vent affec­ter un nombre très impor­tant de per­son­nes avant qu’on puisse faire marche arrière .
La vac­ci­na­tion immé­diate de dizai­nes de mil­lions de per­son­nes par un vaccin peu testé est inquié­tante : c’est une expé­ri­men­ta­tion gran­deur nature .
La sti­mu­la­tion du sys­tème immu­ni­taire par trois doses de vaccin anti­grip­pal en quel­ques semai­nes est une nou­veauté : la grippe sai­son­nière en sep­tem­bre , puis deux doses de vaccin anti-pan­dé­mi­que adju­vanté à trois semai­nes d’inter­valle .

SOUTH HEBRON HILLS : Israeli military blocks access to health and water services for hundreds of Palestinians
SOUTH HEBRON HILLS , PALESTINE
At noon on 5 August 2009 between the villages of Mfaggara and Jinba , Israeli soldiers dug up the road with a military bulldozer , creating three earth mounds that made using the road impossible .
The entire village of Kallet Adbea now lies between two of the earth mounds , which also affect villages south of Kallet Adbea .
Approximately 700 Palestinians living in the area now do not have access to the nearby village of At - Tuwani or to the city of Yatta , north of At - Tuwani
The affected Palestinian population now cannot get to Yatta — where all health services for the region are located — by ambulance or car .
Vehicles likewise cannot deliver food and water to villages in the area , and the villagers can no longer take their products to sell in the Yatta markets .
The Israeli military told international volunteers that the barriers are an attempt “ stop terrorists ” by closing the border between Occupied Palestinian Territories and Israel , which lies approximately five km south of the earth mounds .
Palestinian men traveling to work as migrant laborers in Israel often use this road ( See 12 February CPTnet release , “ AT - TUWANI : Soldiers kill Palestinian migrant worker , increase harassment of villagers in South Hebron Hills . " )
Sarkozy ’s Better Half
Of all the leaders arriving at the G - 20 summit in Pittsburgh today — the third such meeting of finance and other government ministers to discuss the crisis and recovery since the crash of Lehman Brothers a year ago — French President Nicolas Sarkozy has been among the most headline - stealing .
He has called for strict compensation limits for the banking executives who precipitated the crisis and has said he will ask for sanctions on countries that do not comply .
The famously energetic French leader has even threatened to walk out of the summit if his demands are n’t met .
Early word out of Pittsburgh indicates that his brash style is n’t necessarily going to get him what he wants — but luckily , he ’s got a secret weapon .
One of his cabinet officials has been making the press rounds with him , playing good cop to his bad cop in copious interviews in print and on television .
That is Christine Lagarde , France ’s enigmatic finance minister and the former chair of the international law firm Baker & McKenzie .
She has emerged in the past year as a major political player regarding the recession , and as a foil for Sarkozy .
When he shouts , she coos .
When he rages , she deploys wit .
And when he bellows , she demurs .
That coolly philosophic attitude — underpinned by a deep knowledge of labor law , corporations , and international management — has made Lagarde one of Europe ’s most valuable economic negotiators .
If Sarkozy does n’t get what he wants in the final communiqué , Lagarde , his more sensible half , just might .
Christine Lagarde was born to academic parents in Paris on New Year ’s Day in 1956 .
Her father , who died when she was a teenager , was a professor of English , literature , and ancient Greek , and her mother was a grammar - school teacher .
To this day , Lagarde frequently quotes philosophy , and she nearly entered legal academia herself .
She excelled in her youth at school and athletics , growing to 6 feet tall and winning a bronze medal in the French national synchronized swimming competition at age 15 .
After finishing high school , she spent a formative year on an American Field Service exchange program at the swank Holton - Arms girls ’ school in Bethesda , Md. , just outside Washington .
It was 1974 , at the height of the Watergate crisis .
Lagarde interned on Capitol Hill as an office assistant for William Cohen , a Republican congressman from Maine who later served as defense secretary in Bill Clinton ’s cabinet .
She grew close with her American host family , and enamored of the country , which she says is more " positive " than France .
She also garnered a skill which would prove useful later in life : perfect command of English .
But she returned home to study political science at Institut d’Etudes Politiques , d’Aix .
Initially , she considered becoming part of the civil service , but was rejected ( one of the few failures Lagarde admits ) from the highly selective program and decided to become a lawyer instead , focusing on employment law .
Despite her high marks at graduation , she was roundly rejected at French law firms , so sexist was the legal culture in Paris .
Then , she interviewed at Baker & McKenzie , a large Chicago - based firm with a clientele of major international corporations like Coca - Cola .
The Paris office had a female partner , Monique Nion , who became Lagarde ’s mentor .
" There was a feeling of ‘ I went through hell , my dear , and by God , so will you , ’" she told Investor ’s Business Daily .
( Her office did not respond to a request for an interview . )
From the Paris office , Lagarde quickly ascended through the firm ’s ranks by managing major antitrust and labor cases , including ones with mass redundancies .
She made partner in 1987 and then became the head of the firm in Western Europe , shuttling between Brussels , Milan , Madrid , London , and other cities .
The firm still had an old - boy culture , which Lagarde undercut by outworking her colleagues and maintaining a cutting wit , one colleague recalls .
" She was a very smart , very talented even - hand . "
In 1999 , she became the company ’s first ever female chairman ( she dislikes the terms " chairwoman " and " chairperson " ) , moving to Chicago with the mission of streamlining and centralizing the diffuse practice .
Derided as " McFirm " by its competitors , Baker & McKenzie had become massive and inefficient , earning far less per partner than firms like Skadden , Arps , Slate , Meagher & Flom .
In her five years at the helm , she increased revenue by half , to more than $ 1 billion annually , and integrated the company ’s 68 offices .
She also radically transformed partner compensation , despite serious opposition ( pay cuts were " like taking your lunch , " the colleague says ) , making the system more results - based and fairer .
Early one morning in 2004 , Lagarde received a call from Paris .
Then - Prime Minister Dominique de Villepin was on the phone , asking her to come back to France and join the government .
She left her $ 1 million job to become a junior trade minister in President Jacques Chirac ’s cabinet and has spent the past five years ascending the ranks into France ’s political elite .
In the trade bureau and as agriculture minister , a post she held briefly in 2007 , she earned a reputation as a good soldier for Chirac , who advocated for economic dirigisme , or state controls .
She won particular plaudits for her advocacy of certain trade protections for farmers — antithetical to her current positions though that may have been .
When Sarkozy became president in May 2007 , Lagarde became finance minister , a position Sarkozy himself had once held .
Despite their wildly different rhetorical styles , they shared an economic vision for France : free markets , less regulation , and globalization .
The country had languished in lean times even before the financial crisis hit .
It had high unemployment and ran a deficit , largely due to its strict labor laws .
Lagarde and Sarkozy developed a $ 15 billion series of tax cuts and employment - law alterations .
They ended the 35 - hour work week , making overtime tax - free .
They capped the maximum income tax at 50 , rather than 60 , percent .
They eased restrictions on entrepreneurs .
Lagarde also slashed the ranks of her own massive department in the process of cutting 50,000 jobs from the famously bloated French civil service .
To make up for easing taxes on the wealthy , she increased the non-progressive value - added tax .
The motto for Sarkozy ’s economic plan was , " Work more , earn more . "
To sell the unpopular changes , Lagarde turned to philosophy .
In an address to the National Assembly , she said , " There is hardly an ideology that we have n’t turned into a theory .
We have in our libraries enough to talk about for centuries to come .
This is why I would like to tell you : Enough thinking , already .
Roll up your sleeves . "
She also took aim at France ’s intellectuals and socialists , like Bernard - Henri Lévy and Ségolène Royal .
" They want to bring people down to solidarity , " she has said .
" They regard work as alienation in the old Marxist understanding . "
Such pronouncements , coming as part of what critics see as her affection for the " Anglo - Saxon " model of capitalism , have earned her an unflattering nickname : " The American . "
Her asceticism — apparently something the French associate with those across the pond — probably also contributed .
Lagarde is a non-drinking , non-smoking , yoga - performing , lap - swimming , health - obsessed vegetarian .
( She has given up synchronized swimming , saying , " Legs up in the pool is not the expected behavior of the minister of economy . " )
Most famously , she has said that she keeps her " work - life balance " — a term she readily mocks — of caring for her two sons ( who have always lived in Paris and are now in their early 20s ) and juggling a punishing schedule by sleeping just five hours a night .
Since the crisis , however , Lagarde has done almost everything in opposition to the Americans .
She has become a strong voice for international financial reforms : beefing up the powers of the G - 20 Financial Stability Board , levying penalties on tax havens , regulating investment vehicles like hedge funds , raising capital requirements , and , most contentiously , imposing restrictions on bankers ’ pay ( a measure U.S. President Barack Obama and British Prime Minister Gordon Brown oppose ) — something she has plenty of experience with from her time at Baker & McKenzie .
She has done all of this in her characteristically calm - spoken , sensible way , though she has toughened up her rhetoric in the face of U.S. and banker intransigence .
She said it would be " absolutely outrageous and extraordinary if leaders of other countries did not understand the necessity to change the system and not go back to business as usual . "
But because of her relative pro-capitalism ( compared with , say , the Italians ) and her relative calm ( compared with Sarkozy ) , she has become a key figure in the frantic backroom negotiations occurring before the announcement of the G - 20 agreements .
But has anything come from them ?
In the negotiations , which have been ongoing for a year , Lagarde has suggested alternatives to Sarkozy ’s pay caps , such as targeted taxes and regulating what percentage of profits can be paid in bonuses .
Reportedly , the French have not won fixed caps on executive pay in the final communiqué , but the document makes concessions to the country ’s requests for more international cooperation and capital requirements .
( The European Commission may impose executive pay standards instead . )
This small victory is all due to Lagarde , the sensible voice who allows Sarkozy to be outrageous .
Indeed , it ’s " The American ’s " insistence that ensured France had a real voice at the table .
The Metropolitan Fire Service ( MFS ) in Adelaide says it is worrying that two girls lost in a stormwater drain raised the alert on a social networking site rather than ringing triple - 0 .
The 10 - and 12 - year - old girls updated a Facebook status to say they were lost in a drain on Honeypot Road at Hackham in Adelaide 's southern suburbs on Sunday night .
Glenn Benham from the MFS says it was fortunate a young friend was online at the time and was able to call for help for them .
" It is a worry for us because it causes a delay on us being able to rescue the girls , " he said .
" If they were able to access Facebook from their mobile phones , they could have called triple - 0 , so the point being they could have called us directly and we could have got there quicker than relying on someone being online and replying to them and eventually having to call us via triple - 0 anyway . "
Professor of Media and Communications at the Queensland University of Technology , Terry Flew , says public education campaigns are facing an ongoing struggle to compete with social media .
" I 'm sure they [ the girls ] would have had information provided to them in their schools about who to contact in an emergency , but as we know many things that are learnt in school can go in one ear and out the other , " he said .
" For these kids , by the sounds of it , being on Facebook is just such a pervasive part of their lives that it seems the first line of response if they need to communicate a message to others .
" I guess for these people the natural way to send a message out to their friends and others is via Facebook , unfortunately in this case the message was that they were stuck in a stormwater drain . "
He warns that presents a real challenge for public education authorities to get their message across .
" Clearly it 's not good enough to say ' well they should have rung emergency services ' , the point is that they did n't , and we need to think about why that 's the case and what strategies can be used in the future , " he said .
Wikipedia , one of the 10 most popular sites on the Web , was founded about eight years ago as a long - shot experiment to create a free encyclopedia from the contributions of volunteers , all with the power to edit , and presumably improve , the content .
Now , as the English - language version of Wikipedia has just surpassed three million articles , that freewheeling ethos is about to be curbed .
Officials at the Wikimedia Foundation , the nonprofit in San Francisco that governs Wikipedia , say that within weeks , the English - language Wikipedia will begin imposing a layer of editorial review on articles about living people .
The new feature , called “ flagged revisions , ” will require that an experienced volunteer editor for Wikipedia sign off on any change made by the public before it can go live .
Until the change is approved  or in Wikispeak , flagged  it will sit invisibly on Wikipedia ’s servers , and visitors will be directed to the earlier version .
A massive corporate conglomerate , Octopus , Inc. , run by a shrewd and cruel tycoon named Rod McCain ( Kevin Kline ) , purchases a U.K. - based leisure company , and also the failing London Marwood Zoo .
To bring more business to the zoo , Octopus hires a new manager , Rollo Lee ( John Cleese ) , who promptly comes up with a way to increase profits - do away with all of the animals except for the ferocious ones .
This new Fierce Creatures Policy shocks the Marwood zookeepers , led by the unendingly talkative Adrian " Bugsy " Malone ( Sir Michael Palin ) .
Eventually , Rod McCain 's son Vince McCain ( Kevin Kline ) , along with the up - and - coming business executive Willa Weston ( Jamie Lee Curtis ) , take control of the zoo and revoke the Fierce Creatures Policy .
Vince instead comes up with many under - handed and vicious schemes to attract customers - unauthorized celebrity endorsements , shoddy , overpriced zoo merchandise , and using robotic animals instead of real ones .
However , Vince is also stealing from the zoo's .

In 1961 , NASA engineers began designing several types of lunar landers for the Apollo missions before settling on the Lunar Excursion Module .
This super cute 1963 model was called a bug , for obvious reasons .
The engineers were particularly concerned with the unknown nature of the moon 's surface , and worried about such things as how engine exhaust would affect the dust layer .
Complicating matters , scientists disagreed about probable surface characteristics , including the depth of the dust layer .
The 1961 sketch below shows an artist 's concept of a smaller lander that would carry just one man on top of the vehicle .
This " shoestring " vehicle could spend two to four hours on the moon .
NASA also designed an " economy " model that could carry two men and stay on the surface for 24 hours and a " plush " module that would allow a week - long visit .

Spicy Black Bean Hummus
~ Katy ~
One of my clients calls me her “ wife . ”
She says everyone needs a wife , and with her busy schedule , I ’m the one who runs her errands , does the laundry and makes some of the new recipes she wants to try out .
Bonus for me : she sends me home with half of the food since her kids wo n’t eat things like black bean hummus .
She ’s lost about 20 pounds by running and eating well , with many of her recipes coming from Cooking Light Magazine .
This black bean dip looked good to both of us , so I whipped it up one day and liked it so well that I copied the recipe and have served it at several dinner parties .
I ’ve also made it just for something to snack on from time to time .
It ’s been a big hit with most people , and since I have a few vegetarian friends , it ’s a great addition to any party they ’re attending .
.
Please pass the Beano before consuming !

You do n't have to be amazing in order to beat the competition .
The truth is , most people are so bad you just have to be halfway decent to beat them .
Every woman who has used Craigslist knows that it is a veritable jungle of unexpected penises .
In other words , if you ’ve ever posted a nice , g- rated “ women seeking men ” post , you will immediately and inexplicably have 50 - 80 pictures of men ’s penises in your inbox .
After this happened to a number of my friends , I started thinking .
Not just about how horrible men are at online dating , but how to use this to my advantage .
Introducing The Craigslist Penis Effect
The Craigslist Penis Effect describes situations where everyone else is so horrible that , by being even half - decent , you can dominate everyone else and win .
These moron men on Craigslist would be better served writing 5 half - decent responses , testing to see which got the best response , and then sending it out instead of a picture of their generally mediocre manhood .
I did exactly that for my friend on JDate and ended up getting very good at introducing girls to him .
( Jewish women , beware of my Ashkenazi skills . )

Let ’s take some examples where everyone else is so terrible that you can dominate by being even somewhat competent .
Negotiations .
Most people are awful negotiators ( especially for jobs and especially in America ) .
That ’s because nobody teaches us how to negotiate — indeed , we ’re actively taught that it ’s “ weird ” and “ awkward ” to negotiate .
By contrast , I find it “ weird ” to lose $ 10,000 because you did n’t take 5 hours to practice your negotiating pitch beforehand , like my friend Rachel did .
By simply starting a negotiation , you stand out from 80 % of other applicants .

Writing effective emails .
Most people send out dozens of emails per day .
Yet when was the last time they studied the best emailers to learn techniques to ( 1 ) get busy people to respond to them , ( 2 ) cut down on back - and - forth emails , and ( 3 ) get what they wanted via email ?

Conferences .
Most conferences are boring and bad .
But so are most conference go -ers , who do n’t do their homework beforehand , eat with their co-worker , and miss the prime benefits of networking .

Holding onto expensive purchases for years ( even decades ) .
We love to buy expensive things like houses and cars , then turn around and sell them 5 years later .
This is literally one of the most poisonous financial decisions you can make :
Not only do you incur huge transaction costs , but you condition yourself to think that buying and selling expensive goods every few years is normal .
Instead , if you can use the Tripod of Stability to make major purchases , you can spend that money on things that you love — rather than transaction fees .

Earning money online .
As Erica Douglass recently said , “ If you earn $ 1 online , you ’re doing better than 90 % of people . ”
There are thousands of other examples : Writing winning scholarship applications that secure over $ 100,000 in funding .
Or creating blog posts that drive hundreds of thousands of views .
Or simply learning about the basics of social psychology for every day use .
The examples go back to my post about Big Wins , including why trying to save money on lattes is pointless for many people .
As you can see , many Big Wins are actually easily within reach — if you choose the right targets and differentiate yourself from others .
While you ’ll have a few areas of life where you ’ll have to go up against formidable competition , many other areas of life are wide open .
For those , do n’t waste your time competing with lame Craigslist penis guys in a race to mediocrity .
Instead , think about areas where your competition is mediocre ( where everyone is doing the same thing , and doing it poorly ) and carefully test multiple strategies to dominate .
The Craigslist Penis Effect is a guide to standing out from others when being even half - competent can get you superb results .
There are literally thousands of these opportunities .

Who Runs America ?
Noam Chomsky interviewed by Adrian Zupp
The Boston Phoenix , April 1 - 8 , 1999
Noam Chomsky , one of the world ’s leading linguistic thinkers , is also one of its leading political dissidents .
A professor of linguistics at MIT ( where he has taught since 1955 ) , he has consistently spoken out about abuses of power , particularly those involving US corporations .
He has been arrested several times and was on Richard Nixon ’s infamous enemies list .
Chomsky makes countless speaking appearances around the world each year ; his schedule is so tight that it took 15 months to get this interview .
Now 70 , Chomsky is still energetic and expansive ; he is also quiet - spoken , somewhat shy , and exceedingly sincere .
Always quotable , Chomsky has said : “ If the Nuremberg laws were applied today , then every postwar American president would have to be hanged . ”
He has also said : “ It is the responsibility of intellectuals to speak the truth and expose lies . ”
This interview took place in his MIT office .
QUESTION : As you tell it , the main components of power and control in America seem to be corporations , the government , the media , and the public - relations industry .
But many people apparently find it hard to go along with your explanation because they do n’t feel that control could be that monolithic .
CHOMSKY : What you just described is not monolithic .
I mean , you mentioned four things , and within each of these things there ’s a lot of conflict .
First of all , corporations disagree .
And corporations and government are not the same thing .
QUESTION : But I get the impression that a lot of people think that you ’re saying that it ’s a massive conspiracy .
CHOMSKY : That ’s true maybe of people in the Harvard faculty , but that ’s because for them conspiracy is a curse word .
If something comes along that you do n’t like , there are a few sort of four - letter words that you can use to push it out of the sphere of discussion .
If you were in a bar downtown , they might have different words , but if you ’re an educated person what you use are complicated words like conspiracy theory or Marxist .
It ’s a way of pushing unpleasant questions off the agenda so that we can continue in our own happy ideology .
QUESTION : So would you say that the elite groups are not so much coordinated in producing the system as they are unanimous in protecting it ?
CHOMSKY : There are matters on which they tend to be in overwhelming agreement .
There are other matters on which there are internal differences .
And in fact , when you investigate the media product , what you typically find is that on topics on which there is very broad consensus , there ’s no discussion .
On topics where there ’s debate , there is discussion .
A dramatic recent case was the Multilateral Agreement on Investments [ a proposed global economic treaty ] .
On that there was near - uniformity in the corporate sector , the government , the media component of the corporate sector , the international financial institutions .
They were all in favor of this treaty , overwhelmingly .
They all understood very well that the public is not going to like it , so for years they just kept it secret .
On that issue , no discussion .
The same happened on NAFTA [ the North American Free Trade Agreement ] .
The same sectors were overwhelmingly in favor , but they knew the population was n’t going to like it — which in fact remained true right until the end .
So they simply would never allow debate on it .
To their distress , the issue broke through because of popular activism and because of Ross Perot , who just made a fuss about it .
So it was impossible to suppress it totally .
And what happened then is extremely interesting .
What happened is , the major press — the New York Times , let ’s say — simply never allowed it to be discussed .
The labor movement , for example , had a position , but it was never allowed to be presented .
The labor movement was condemned by curse words : it was “ old - fashioned , ” “ crude , ” “ tough , ” “ blundering , ” a long series of curse words .
Here you have a consensus among the elite .
And this is true on many other issues .
Let ’s take an international issue — say , the Vietnam War .
There ’s a pretense now — the press like to pretend that they were opposing the war and being courageous .
That ’s complete nonsense .
If you look back , they supported the war overwhelmingly .
I mean , not even a flicker of disagreement .
And then when a debate did develop among the real power sectors as to whether it was worth pursuing or not — like , is it costing us too much ? — at that point [ the press ] divided also .
Some of them said yes , it ’s costing us too much .
Others said it was n’t .
On the other hand , the position of the American population was never expressed .
And we know what that position was .
We have extensive polls .
From about the time that they started being taken , the late ’60s , into the early ’90s , about 70 percent of the population said that the war was fundamentally wrong and immoral .
Try to find that view anywhere in the press .
I ’ve been through it .
The view of 70 percent of the population was inexpressible .
And it is not just in the media .
Pretty much in the scholarly profession , intellectual journals , business sectors , and so on .
There are some questions you do n’t ask , as was pointed out by George Orwell years ago .
He wrote an essay , an important essay , maybe the most important one he ever wrote — and it was not published , incidentally .
It was the introduction to Animal Farm , which everybody ’s read in school .
But you did n’t read any introduction .
The introduction was about censorship in England .
He said , “ Look , this is a satire about a totalitarian state , but we should n’t be self - righteous — it ’s not that different in free England . ”
He said in free England there are many ways in which ideas that are unpopular will just not be able to be expressed .
And he gave two ways .
One , he said , is that the press is owned by wealthy men who have every reason not to want certain ideas to be expressed .
And second , he said , if you have a good education , you have internalized the fact that there are some things it just would n’t do to say .
One of the things it would n’t do to say is that actions the United States government is taking might be fundamentally wrong or immoral .
It just would n’t do to say that .
And it would n’t do to think it .
And if you ’re a well - educated , respectable type , it ca n’t occur to your mind .
For the 70 percent of the population who do n’t have the benefits of a good education , they can see it .
Because it ’s obviously true .
This is true on issue after issue , including unimportant issues .
Let ’s take an unimportant issue , namely the one that has dominated the news for the last year : the silly scandals in Washington .
Now , they ’re an absolute obsession with elites .
Educated elites across the spectrum have been completely obsessed with it .
Journals , television , everything .
The public was not interested ; they wanted them to stop it a year ago .
In fact , the split between public opinion and elite obsession became so extreme that it even aroused some commentary , which is unusual .
But that was extremely clear .
The elite could not get enough of the soft porn .
And the public did n’t care — if they wanted soft porn they could find it somewhere else .
And they wanted Congress and the executive to get on to some serious business .
I mean , who cares if some guy had an affair ?
QUESTION : So was that a victory for distracting people from systemic corruption ?
CHOMSKY : I would n’t call it corruption .
I mean , corruption takes place , but what ’s far more significant is what ’s not corrupt .
Like ramming through NAFTA the way they did .
That was not corrupt .
Fighting the Vietnam War was not corrupt .
The Telecommunications
Act of 1996 gave away maybe a hundred billion dollars ’ worth of publicly owned property — namely the digital spectrum — to a few megacorporations .
That was n’t corrupt .
It was highway robbery on a massive scale , but not corrupt .
The question arises : “ Why was it an elite obsession when the public did n’t want it ? ”
Well , okay , now we have to speculate , but I think a plausible speculation is exactly what you ’re saying .
In a sense , that would make it on a par with the years of censorship to prevent people from knowing about the MAI and the refusal to allow opposing positions on NAFTA even to be articulated .
Now , the press will tell you they had a debate about that .
They think they had a wonderful debate .
They even had a town meeting with Gore or Perot or something .
But Perot is a good person for them to have a debate with , because they can make fun of him .
It was going to be a little harder to make fun of the labor movement and the Office of Technology Assessment and the economists who were giving the same arguments , so therefore they were out of it .
And a debate was set up , but only one that you could treat as a comic act .
And they were very proud of it .
QUESTION : You ’ve said that true capitalism does n’t work and no one really believes in it ; so bogus capitalism is what ’s going on in America , and communist and socialist systems seem to get co-opted by self - serving elites .
What sort of economic and governmental system do you think is viable ?
CHOMSKY : Systems like capitalism and socialism and communism have never been tried .
What we ’ve had since the Industrial Revolution was one or another form of state capitalism .
It ’s been overwhelmed , certainly in the last century , by big conglomerations of capital corporate structures that are all interlinked with one another and form strategic alliances and administer markets and so on .
And are tied up with a very powerful state .
So it ’s some other kind of system — call it whatever you want .
Corporate - administered markets in a powerful state system .
Actually , the Soviet Union was something like that .
They did n’t have General Electric , they had more concentration of the state system , but apart from that it worked rather like a state - capitalist system .
And do these systems work ?
Yeah , they kind of work .
For example , the Soviet Union was a monstrosity , but it had a pretty fast growth rate — a growth rate unknown in the Western economies .
In the 1960s the economy started to stagnate and decline , but for a long period they had a growth rate that was very alarming to Western leaders .
Does the US system work ?
Yeah , it works in some ways .
Take , say , the last 10 years .
One percent of the population is making out like bandits .
The top 10 percent of the population is doing pretty well .
The next 10 percent actually lost net worth , and you go down below and [ it gets ] still worse .
I mean , it ’s such a rich country that even relatively poor people are still more or less getting by .
It ’s not like Haiti .
On the other hand , it ’s an economic catastrophe .
The typical family in the United States is working , latest estimates are , about 15 weeks a year more than they did 20 years ago — just to keep stagnating , or even declining , incomes .
That ’s a success in the richest , most privileged country in the world ?
But it works .
I mean , you and I are sitting here and we ’re not starving , so something ’s working .
It ’s a little unfair in my case because I ’m up in that top few percent who , like I said , are making out like bandits .
But most people are n’t .
So it ’s a mixed success .
QUESTION : But do you see a way that will …
CHOMSKY : Yeah , sure .
I do n’t see why we have to have a system in which the wealth that gets created is directed , overwhelmingly , to a tiny percentage of the population .
Nor do I see a system that has to be as radically undemocratic .
I mean , remember how undemocratic it is .
A private corporation , let ’s say General Electric , is , in fact , just a pure tyranny .
You and I have nothing to say about how it works .
The people inside the corporation have nothing to say about how it works , except that they can take orders from above and give them down below .
It ’s what we call tyranny .
And when those institutions also control the government , the framework for popular decision - making very much narrows .
In fact , that ’s the purpose of shrinking government .
It ’s so that the sphere of popular decision - making will narrow and more decisions will fall into the hands of the private tyrannies .
“ Government ” is a kind of interesting term in American political mythology .
The government is presented as some enemy that ’s outside , something coming from outer space .
So when the IRS comes to collect your taxes , it ’s this enemy coming to steal your money .
That ’s driven into your head from infancy , almost .
There ’s another way of looking at it , which is that the IRS is the instrument by which you and I decide how to spend our resources for schools and roads and so on .
Whatever faults the government has , and there are plenty , it ’s the one institution in which people can , at least in principle and sometimes in fact , make a difference .
So government ’s shrinking , meaning the public role is shrinking .
And business — that is , unaccountable private power — has to take its place .
That ’s the dominant ideology .
Why should we accept that ?
Suppose someone said , “ Look , you ’ve got to have a king or a slave owner . ”
Should we accept it ?
I mean , yes , there are much better systems .
Democracy would be a better system .
And there are a lot of ways for the country to become way more democratic .
Handing over the digital spectrum , or for that matter the Internet , to private power — that ’s a huge blow against democracy .
In the case of the Internet , it ’s a particularly dramatic blow against democracy because this was paid for by the public .
How undemocratic can you get ?
Here is a major instrument , developed by the public — first part of the Pentagon , and then universities and the National Science Foundation — handed over in some manner that nobody knows to private corporations who want to turn it into an instrument of control .
They want to turn it into a home shopping center .
You know , where it will help them convert you into the kind of person they want .
Namely , someone who is passive , apathetic , sees their life only as a matter of having more commodities that they do n’t want .
Why give them a powerful weapon to turn you into that kind of a person ?
Especially after you paid for the weapon ?
Well , that ’s what ’s happening right in front of our eyes .
Could the system be different ?
Of course it could be different .
This [ the Internet ] could remain what it ought to be : just a public instrument .
There ought to be efforts — not just talk but real efforts — to ensure Internet access , not just for rich people but for everyone .
And it should be freed from the influence of Microsoft or anybody else .
They do n’t have any rights to have anything to do with that system .
They had almost nothing to do with creating it .
What little they did was on federal contract .
And we can say the same across the board .
There are a lot of changes that can be made .
Now let ’s take , say , living wages .
There are now living - wage campaigns in many places .
They ’re very good campaigns , it ’s a great idea .
But if you had a free press , what they would be telling you is the following , because they know the facts .
If you look at American history , since , say , the 1930s , the minimum wage tracked productivity .
So as productivity went up , the minimum wage went up .
Which , if you believe in a capitalist society , makes sense .
That stops in the mid-’60s .
Suppose you made it continue to track productivity .
The minimum wage would be about double what it is now .
Now , to say that we should continue doing what was done for 30 years and what just makes obvious sense — there ’s nothing radical about that .
If you had a free press , this would be all over the front page .
But you ’re not going to find it on the front pages , because the corporate media and their leaders and owners , they do n’t want that to be an issue .
Well , you know , this does n’t have to remain .
We ’re free agents .
We ’re not living in fear of death squads .
We can organize to change these things .
Every single one of them .
QUESTION : With respect to that , you seem to be someone whom a lot of people listen to .
Could you do some things that make the media focus on you ?
CHOMSKY : I ’ve done all that .
I ’ve been in and out of jail any number of times for organizing .
I organized national tax resistance ; I was one of the people who organized national draft resistance .
I mean , I was up for a long jail sentence .
It was so close that my wife went back to school because we figured we were going to have to have somebody who ’d take care of the three children .
It ’s true that I do n’t spend a lot of time in organizing .
I used to , but there came to be a sort of division of labor at some point .
And I think we all figured that I ’m more helpful when I go out giving talks and show up at fundraising events and so on .
QUESTION : Do you ever get exhortative in your lectures ?
Do you try to stir people up ?
CHOMSKY : No .
People say , “ Look , he ’s not a good speaker , ” and I ’m happy about that .
If I knew how to do it , I would n’t .
I really dislike good speakers .
I think they ’re dangerous people .
Because you should n’t be exhorting people by the force of your rhetoric .
You should be getting them to think about it so they can figure out what they want to do .
The best way to do that , that I can imagine , is to say , “ Why do n’t you think about these questions ? ”
Quietly , not screaming .
“ Think about these questions .
Figure out for yourself what ’s the best way to deal with them . ”
We are in a progressive moment , a moment when the ground is shifting beneath our feet , and anything is possible .
What we considered unimaginable about what could be said and hoped for a year ago is now possible .
At a time like this , it is absolutely critical that we be as clear as we possibly can be about what it is that we want because we might just get it .
So the stakes are high .
I usually talk about the bailout in speeches these days .
We all need to understand it because it is a robbery in progress , the greatest heist in monetary history .
But today I 'd like to take a different approach :
What if the bailout actually works , what if the financial sector is saved and the economy returns to the course it was on before the crisis struck ?
Is that what we want ?
And what would that world look like ?
The answer is that it would look like Sarah Palin .
Hear me out , this is not a joke .
I do n't think we have given sufficient consideration to the meaning of the Palin moment .
Think about it : Sarah Palin stepped onto the world stage as Vice Presidential candidate on August 29 at a McCain campaign rally , to much fanfare .
Exactly two weeks later , on September 14 , Lehman Brothers collapsed , triggering the global financial meltdown .
So in a way , Palin was the last clear expression of capitalism - as - usual before everything went south .
That 's quite helpful because she showed us -- in that plainspoken , down - homey way of hers -- the trajectory the U.S. economy was on before its current meltdown .
By offering us this glimpse of a future , one narrowly avoided , Palin provides us with an opportunity to ask a core question :
Do we want to go there ?
Do we want to save that pre-crisis system , get it back to where it was last September ?
Or do we want to use this crisis , and the electoral mandate for serious change delivered by the last election , to radically transform that system ?
We need to get clear on our answer now because we have n't had the potent combination of a serious crisis and a clear progressive democratic mandate for change since the 1930s .
We use this opportunity , or we lose it .
So what was Sarah Palin telling us about capitalism - as - usual before she was so rudely interrupted by the meltdown ?
Let 's first recall that before she came along , the U.S. public , at long last , was starting to come to grips with the urgency of the climate crisis , with the fact that our economic activity is at war with the planet , that radical change is needed immediately .
We were actually having that conversation : Polar bears were on the cover of Newsweek magazine .
And then in walked Sarah Palin .
The core of her message was this :
Those environmentalists , those liberals , those do - gooders are all wrong .
You do n't have to change anything .
You do n't have to rethink anything .
Keep driving your gas - guzzling car , keep going to Wal - Mart and shop all you want .
The reason for that is a magical place called Alaska .
Just come up here and take all you want .
" Americans , " she said at the Republican National Convention , " we need to produce more of our own oil and gas .
Take it from a gal who knows the North Slope of Alaska , we 've got lots of both . "
And the crowd at the convention responded by chanting and chanting : " Drill , baby , drill . "
Watching that scene on television , with that weird creepy mixture of sex and oil and jingoism , I remember thinking : " Wow , the RNC has turned into a rally in favour of screwing Planet Earth . "
Literally .
But what Palin was saying is what is built into the very DNA of capitalism : the idea that the world has no limits .
She was saying that there is no such thing as consequences , or real - world deficits .
Because there will always be another frontier , another Alaska , another bubble .
Just move on and discover it .
Tomorrow will never come .
This is the most comforting and dangerous lie that there is : the lie that perpetual , unending growth is possible on our finite planet .
And we have to remember that this message was incredibly popular in those first two weeks , before Lehman collapsed .
Despite Bush 's record , Palin and McCain were pulling ahead .
And if it were n't for the financial crisis , and for the fact that Obama started connecting with working class voters by putting deregulation and trickle - down economics on trial , they might have actually won .
The President tells us he wants to look forward , not backwards .
But in order to confront the lie of perpetual growth and limitless abundance that is at the centre of both the ecological and financial crises , we have to look backwards .
And we have to look way backwards , not just to the past eight years of Bush and Cheney , but to the very founding of this country , to the whole idea of the settler state .
Modern capitalism was born with the so - called discovery of the Americas .
It was the pillage of the incredible natural resources of the Americas that generated the excess capital that made the Industrial Revolution possible .
Early explorers spoke of this land as a New Jerusalem , a land of such bottomless abundance , there for the taking , so vast that the pillage would never have to end .
This mythology is in our biblical stories - of floods and fresh starts , of raptures and rescues - and it is at the centre of the American Dream of constant reinvention .
What this myth tells us is that we do n't have to live with our pasts , with the consequences of our actions .
We can always escape , start over .
These stories were always dangerous , of course , to the people who were already living on the " discovered " lands , to the people who worked them through forced labour .
But now the planet itself is telling us that we cannot afford these stories of endless new beginnings anymore .
That is why it is so significant that at the very moment when some kind of human survival instinct kicked in , and we seemed finally to be coming to grips with the Earth 's natural limits , along came Palin , the new and shiny incarnation of the colonial frontierswoman , saying : Come on up to Alaska .
There is always more .
Do n't think , just take .
This is not about Sarah Palin .
It 's about the meaning of that myth of constant " discovery , " and what it tells us about the economic system that they 're spending trillions of dollars to save .
What it tells us is that capitalism , left to its own devices , will push us past the point from which the climate can recover .
And capitalism will avoid a serious accounting - whether of its financial debts or its ecological debts - at all costs .
Because there 's always more .
A new quick fix .
A new frontier .
That message was selling , as it always does .
It was only when the stock market crashed that people said , " Maybe Sarah Palin is n't a great idea this time around .
Let 's go with the smart guy to ride out the crisis . "
I almost feel like we 've been given a last chance , some kind of a reprieve .
I try not to be apocalyptic , but the global warming science I read is scary .
This economic crisis , as awful as it is , pulled us back from that ecological precipice that we were about to drive over with Sarah Palin and gave us a tiny bit of time and space to change course .
And I think it 's significant that when the crisis hit , there was almost a sense of relief , as if people knew they were living beyond their means and had gotten caught .
We suddenly had permission to do things together other than shop , and that spoke to something deep .
But we are not free from the myth .
The willful blindness to consequences that Sarah Palin represents so well is embedded in the way Washington is responding to the financial crisis .
There is just an absolute refusal to look at how bad it is .
Washington would prefer to throw trillions of dollars into a black hole rather than find out how deep the hole actually is .
That 's how willful the desire is not to know .
And we see lots of other signs of the old logic returning .
Wall Street salaries are almost back to 2007 levels .
There 's a certain kind of electricity in the claims that the stock market is rebounding .
" Can we stop feeling guilty yet ? " you can practically hear the cable commentators asking .
" Is the bubble back yet ? "
And they may well be right .
This crisis is n't going to kill capitalism or even change it substantively .
Without huge popular pressure for structural reform , the crisis will prove to have been nothing more than a very wrenching adjustment .
The result will be even greater inequality than before the crisis .
Because the millions of people losing their jobs and their homes are n't all going to be getting them back , not by a long shot .
And manufacturing capacity is very difficult to rebuild once it 's auctioned off .
It 's appropriate that we call this a " bailout . "
Financial markets are being bailed out to keep the ship of finance capitalism from sinking , but what is being scooped out is not water .
It 's people .
It 's people who are being thrown overboard in the name of " stabilization . "
The result will be a vessel that is leaner and meaner .
Much meaner .
Because great inequality - the super rich living side by side with the economically desperate - requires a hardening of the hearts .
We need to believe ourselves superior to those who are excluded in order to get through the day .
So this is the system that is being saved : the same old one , only meaner .
And the question that we face is :
Should our job be to bail out this ship , the biggest pirate ship that ever was , or to sink it and replace it with a sturdier vessel , one with space for everyone ?
One that does n't require these ritual purges , during which we throw our friends and our neighbours overboard to save the people in first class .
One that understands that the Earth does n't have the capacity for all of us to live better and better .
But it does have the capacity , as Bolivian President Evo Morales said recently at the U.N. , " for all of us to live well . "
Because make no mistake : Capitalism will be back .
And the same message will return , though there may be someone new selling that message :
You do n't need to change .
Keep consuming all you want .
There 's plenty more .
Drill , baby , drill .
Maybe there will be some technological fix that will make all our problems disappear .
And that is why we need to be absolutely clear right now .
Capitalism can survive this crisis .
But the world can't survive another capitalist comeback .

Update 2 :
Whoa -- we were just sent AT&T response to the FCC 's investigation into the rejection of Google Voice apps from the iPhone app store , and Ma Bell is n't pulling any punches : according to the letter , AT&T " had no role in any decision by Apple to not accept the Google Voice application . "
That puts the ball pretty firmly in Apple 's court , but it does n't close the door on AT&T 's involvement in App store approval shenanigans entirely , since the letter also says " AT&T has had discussions with Apple regarding only a handful of applications that have been submitted to Apple for review where , as described below , there were concerns that the application might create significant network congestion . "
Not only did that result in CBS and MobiTV killing the Final Four app's ability to stream video over 3G , it also explains what happened to SlingPlayer Mobile -- we 'll see what the FCC says about that .
And here come Apple and Google 's responses as well !
We 're digesting everything as fast as we can , we 're going to do this semi- liveblog style after the break , so grab a frosty and dive in .
Okay , so we 've read through all three filings and broken them down after the break .
Our main takeaway ?
Apple 's being pretty hypocritical by claiming on the one hand that the iPhone is at the forefront of a mobile revolution and then saying iPhone users can't figure out how Google Voice is different than the iPhone 's built - in functionality on the other .
Either your customers are paradigm - busting visionaries or they 're not very smart at all , Apple -- you have to pick one .
As for AT&T , well , it just seems like it 's worried about its network above all else , and while we think it 's ridiculous that it enforces the VoIP and SlingPlayer ban on the iPhone and not , say , Windows Mobile devices , we can see why the carrier would push those contract provisions hard .
In the end , we 're just hoping the FCC forces everyone involved to be more open and transparent about what they 're doing and the deals they 're making -- Apple 's not necessarily exaggerating when it says these are entirely new problems , and whatever happens next will set a precedent for a long time to come .
Republicans to Push Against Net Neutrality ; FCC Says Start of Process
Senate Republicans moved Monday afternoon to prevent the FCC 's proposed rules on net neutrality with an amendment to the Interior Appropriations bill that would tie up funding at the agency for new regulatory mandates .
Observers said , however , that the move was unlikely to be approved in the Democrat - majority Congress .
Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison ( R - Texas ) , ranking member of Senate Commerce , Science , and Transportation Committee , said in a release :
" We must tread lightly when it comes to new regulations .
Where there have been a handful of questionable actions in the past on the part of a few companies , the Commission and the marketplace have responded swiftly , " Hutchison said in the release .
" The case has simply not been made for what amounts to a significant regulatory intervention into a vibrant marketplace .
These new regulatory mandates and restrictions could stifle investment incentives , " she said .
Senators John Ensign ( R - Nev. ) , Sam Brownback ( R - Kansas ) , David Vitter ( R - La. ) , Jim DeMint ( R - S.C. ) and John Thune ( R - S.D. co-sponsored the amendment .
Rebecca Arbogast , head of technology policy research at Stifel Nicholas , said the move was a standard vehicle for Congress to block what regulatory agencies were trying to achieve in the executive branch or in a regulatory agency .
" But the likelihood of it getting passed it pretty low .
This is standard procedure and a time - honored tradition but the Republicans are in the minority . "
The two Republican commissioners at the five - member FCC issued a joint statement
in response to FCC Chairman Julius Genachowski's announcement , expressed concern that conclusions have been prematurely drawn about how consumers and businesses are being affected by Web policies .
" We are concerned that both factual and legal conclusions may have been drawn before the process has begun , " said Commissioners Robert McDowell and Merideth Baker .
" We do not believe that the Commission should adopt regulations based merely on anecdotes , or in an effort to alleviate the political pressures of the day , if the facts do not clearly demonstrate that a problem needs to be remedied . "
An official at the agency stressed , however , that Genachowski viewed the proposal as the start of a process to investigate how new rules for the Internet should be approached for different technologies .
Some wireless providers have balked at the proposal , with AT&T saying it does not agree that the rules should apply to its giant national wireless network because of capacity constraints .
Genachowski said in his speech that the rules would apply to all platforms - which would include wireless - but that such questions would be part of a process that will begin late October to come up with new rules .
If approved , final rules could be drawn next spring .

A patch of kudzu grows in Leamington , Ont. , the first patch of the invasive species ever to be found in Canada .
( ( Sam Brinker / Ministry of Natural Resources ) )
An invasive plant that has destroyed large swaths of land in the southern United States has been discovered for the first time in Canada .
The patch of kudzu vine was found on a bluff overlooking Lake Erie in Leamington , Ont. , a farming community about 30 kilometres southeast of Windsor .
It measures 120 metres by 50 metres and is " pretty well established " but contained , according to Rachel Gagnon , a co-ordinator with the Ontario Invasive Plant Council ( OIPC ) .
" There 's a possibility to control that spot before it starts spreading into new areas , " Gagnon said .
If not destroyed immediately , the plant could wind up costing " millions of dollars to eradicate , " said Rowan Sage , a biology professor at the University of Toronto , who began studying kudzu 20 years ago .
" It becomes a nuisance on land people want to be productive , " Sage said .
" Once it gets established in a region , it gets to be a problem . "
The patch could easily be pulled out or even fed to a herd of goats , Sage said .
Aggressive growing behaviour
Kudzu is " an aggressive invader , " the OIPC says in a pamphlet describing the vine , which looks like two - metre - tall bean stalk .
A close up of a kudzu leaf .
The vines can grow as much as 30 centimetres a day and reach heights of 2.1 metres .
( ( Rachel Gagnon / Ontario Invasive Plant Council ) )
It grows up to 30 centimetres a day , blanketing everything in its path , including hydro poles , fences , houses and highway signs .
It destroys tree species and other vegetation , the pamphlet says , " either by girdling them as it climbs , breaking them from the weight of the vines , or eventually by blanketing them and causing death by preventing photosynthesis . "
Kudzu is also an alternate host for soybean rust , a pathogen that reduces crop yields .
Southern Ontario accounts for more than 66 per cent of the province 's total soybean production , according to the Ontario Soybean Growers ' 2008 annual report .
But the spread of kudzu is not " a major issue , " according to Horst Bohner , a soybean specialist with the Ontario Ministry of Agriculture , Food and Rural Affairs , because the crop disease cannot survive the region 's cold winter .
" When you have a frost like we obviously do , the rust cannot overwinter , " Bohner said .
' The vine that ate the South '
Originally imported to the United States from Asia in 1876 for the World 's Fair , kudzu was later planted widely along highways to prevent erosion .
In time , however , the aggressive vine invaded at least a dozen southern states , including Florida , Tennesee and parts of Texas , giving it the nickname " the vine that ate the South . "
It began to migrate north and has been reported in Ohio and southern Michigan , meaning it can " clearly survive at this latitude , " Sage said .
He is especially curious to know whether the kudzu growing in Leamington floated over Lake Erie from Michigan or if it was imported on purpose .
" Knowing how it got there is probably more important than it being there , " he said .
" It 's the ' how ' that will help us prevent this in the future . "
SEATTLE , Washington ( Reuters Life ! ) - Teenager Jordan Robinson has faced excruciating pain since a backyard prank went wrong but treatment with virtual reality has given him some relief .
Robinson , 18 , and his friends thought it would be fun to shoot flaming arrows at bags full of gasoline in his backyard but it turned out to be a very bad idea , landing him in hospital with severe burns on both of his legs .
“ I ’ve broken bones , I have done all sorts of stuff and I have never felt a pain like this , ” he told Reuters TV .
Robinson is taking morphine , but he also has access to a tool not commonly used in most hospitals -- virtual reality pain reduction .
While nurses manipulate his scarred and tender body through physical therapy , his mind is far away , immersed in a computer - generated world of snow and ice using virtual reality .
Normally he’d be in great pain as his burned legs are made to bend and straighten during therapy but in his virtual world , Robinson is too busy throwing snowballs at penguins and snowmen to notice much pain .
“ It helps a lot .
I was n’t expecting it to as helpful as it was .
I have n’t ever done anything like that before but I definitely was n’t expecting it to make as big of a difference as it did , ” he said .
Robinson has Hunter Hoffman , the director of the Virtual Reality Research Center at the University of Washington to thank for the extra pain relief .
Hoffman created “ SnowWorld . ”
“ What virtual reality does is give them a place to escape .
There is a natural tendency when you are in pain to want to leave the room or to get away from what is causing the pain , ” said Hoffman who is continually working to refine his techniques .
ESCAPE FROM REALITY
“ In this case , we need their bodies to stay there while they are being worked on but their minds can escape into “ SnowWorld ” and they have this illusion of going into this computer generated world .
That leaves less attention available to process the pain signals . ”
David Patterson , also a professor at Washington University and the head of psychology at the Department of Rehab Medicine at Harbor View Medical Center in Seattle , has been working with Hoffman for several years on the virtual reality project .
He explains that virtual reality is used two ways to help manage pain in burn victims -- by distracting the patient and by using hypnotic suggestion during burn care .
Patterson said pain distraction alone has been proven to decrease the pain during burn treatment by between 30 and 50 percent in a clinical setting .
He hopes combining both techniques they can get even better results , ultimately leading to smaller doses of pain drugs .
Robinson ’s mother , Kate , has been sitting by her son ’s hospital bed as he heals and is hoping for a full recovery -- although she has n’t forgotten what put her son in hospital .
“ As we were driving here I told him that I loved him and that I cared about him and that I was really sorry that he was going through all of this pain .
But as soon as they get him all patched back together , I ’m probably going to kill him , ” she said .

Advertisement A woman is seeking a judicial review after she was allegedly detained and handcuffed by police who tried to get her mobile phone after she filmed them .
Gemma Atkinson said police stopped her boyfriend Fred Grace at Aldgate East station on suspicion of carrying drugs .
As she filmed the incident in March in east London an officer asked her to stop , citing anti-terror laws .
Officers tried to take the phone , she claims .
The Metropolitan Police said it had received a complaint .
Ms Atkinson , 27 , said police found no drugs on her boyfriend during the search on 25 March , but then turned their attention to her .
I was pushed into this alcove in the station and I was yanked up and down for quite a while before I was handcuffed
Gemma Atkinson Ms Atkinson said : " I was still filming when a man [ a plainclothes officer ] came to me and told me that it was illegal under the Terrorism Act to film police officers .
" I put the phone in my pocket so he could n't get to it , he was asking for me to hand it over which I refused to do .
" So then he got other officers to come and hold both my arms then come at me to try and get my phone out of my pocket .
" I was pushed into this alcove in the station and I was yanked up and down for quite a while before I was handcuffed , " she said .
She has complained to the Independent Police Complaints Commission and the Met and is now taking the issue to the High Court .
Gemma Atkinson said she was handcuffed and held by three officers Her lawyer Raju Bhatt , from Bhatt Murphy Solicitors , said : " There is nothing in the Terrorism Act which permits the police to prevent you or me from filming them in the ordinary course of events in the absence of some suspicion of connection with terrorism .
" Here the issue is the extent to which we are going to permit police officers to avoid scrutiny of their actions by invoking these powers in abuse of what Parliament intended . "
A spokesman for the Met said : " We have received a complaint relating to an alleged incident on 25 March at Aldgate East Tube station .
" The Directorate of Professional Standards is investigating and at this stage no officers have been suspended . "
The Met said it would be " inappropriate " to comment further .

Scientists have been skeptical of claims of mathematical abilities in animals ever since the case of Clever Hans about 100 years ago .
The horse , which performed arithmetic and other intellectual tasks to delighted European audiences , was in reality simply taking subconscious cues from his trainer .
Modern examples , such as Alex the African grey parrot , which could count up to six and knew sums and differences , are seen by some as special cases or the product of conditioning .
Recent studies , however , have uncovered new instances of a counting skill in different species , suggesting that mathematical abilities could be more fundamental in biology than previously thought .
Under certain conditions , monkeys could sometimes outperform college students .
In a study published last summer in the Proceedings of the Royal Society B , Kevin C. Burns of Victoria University of Wellington in New Zealand and his colleagues burrowed holes in fallen logs and stored varying numbers of mealworms ( beetle larvae ) in these holes in full view of wild New Zealand robins at the Karori Wildlife Sanctuary .
Not only did the robins flock first to the holes with the most mealworms , but if Burns tricked them , removing some of the insects when they were n’t looking , the robins spent twice as long scouring the hole for the missing mealworms .
“ They probably have some innate ability to discern between small numbers ” as three and four , Burns thinks , but they also “ use their number sense on a daily basis , and so through trial and error , they can train themselves to identify numbers up to 12 . ”
More recently , in the April issue of the same Royal Society journal , Rosa Rugani of the University of Trento in Italy and her team demonstrated arithmetic in newly hatched chickens .
The scientists reared the chicks with five identical objects , and the newborns imprinted on these objects , considering them their parents .
But when the scientists subtracted two or three of the original objects and left the remainders behind screens , the chicks went looking for the larger number of objects , sensing that Mom was more like a three and not a two .
Rugani also varied the size of the objects to rule out the possibility the chicks were identifying groups based simply on the fact that larger numbers of items take up more space than smaller numbers .
For the past five years Jessica Cantlon of the University of Rochester has been conducting a series of experiments with rhesus monkeys that shows how their numerical skills can rival those of humans .
The monkeys , she found , could choose the lesser of two sets of objects when they were the same in size , shape and color .
And when size , shape and color were varied , the monkeys showed no change in accuracy or reaction time .
One animal , rewarded with Kool - Aid , was 10 to 20 percent less accurate than college students but beat them in reaction time .
“ The monkey did n’t mind missing every once in a while , ” Cantlon recounts .
“ It wants to get past the mistake and on to the next problem where it can get more Kool - Aid , whereas college students ca n’t shake their worry over guessing wrong . ”
Elizabeth Brannon of Duke University has conducted similar experiments with rhesus monkeys , getting them to match the number of sounds they hear to the number of shapes they see , proving they can do math across different senses .
She also tested the monkeys ’ ability to do subtraction by covering a number of objects and then removing some of them .
In all cases , the monkeys picked the correct remainder at a rate greater than chance .
And although they might not grasp the deeper concept of zero as a number , the monkeys knew it was less than two or one , conclude Brannon and her colleagues in the May Journal of Experimental Psychology : General .
Although Brannon feels that animals do not have a linguistic sense of numbers — they are n’t counting “ one , two , three ” in their heads — they can do a rough sort of math by summing sets of objects without actually using numbers , and she believes that ability is innate .
Brannon thinks that it might have evolved from the need for territorial animals “ to access the different sizes of competing groups and for foraging animals to determine whether it is good to stay in one area given the amount of food retrieved versus the amount of time invested . ”
Irene Pepperberg of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , famous for her 30 - year work with Alex the parrot , says that even bees can learn to discriminate among small quantities .
“ So some degree of ‘ number sense ’ seems to be able to be learned even in invertebrates , and such learning is unlikely without some underlying neural architecture on which it is based , ” she remarks .
Understanding the biological basis of number sense in animals could have relevance to people .
According to Brannon , it may suggest to childhood educators that math , usually taught after age four or five , could actually be introduced earlier into the curriculum .

Thousands of opposition supporters have clashed with security forces during a government - sponsored rally in Tehran .
Iran 's reformists had been warned not to try to turn the pro-Palestinian Quds ( Jerusalem )
Day marches into anti-government protests .
Reports say opposition leaders Mir-Hossein Mousavi and former President Mohammad Khatami were attacked .
The opposition has been banned from holding rallies since the disputed presidential election in June .
As part of the Quds Day events , President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad delivered a speech in which he repeated his view that the Nazi Holocaust was a myth .
Tear gas
The Quds Day rallies are held annually on the last Friday of the Muslim fasting month of Ramadan .
ANALYSIS BBC former Tehran correspondent Jim Muir Thousands of opposition protesters rose to the call of their leaders .
It was the first time in two months they have been out on the streets in numbers .
There have been mounting calls in right - wing circles for reformist leaders to be arrested , as hundreds of their followers have been .
That could be the next phase of the drama .
The protests may not have achieved much in themselves but they have shown that the movement is still alive and defiant and the country , and its political system , remain deeply divided .
That is not what Mr Ahmadinejad wanted to see as he prepares for important exchanges with the outside world .
Iran 's unresolved crisis
The day began peacefully , with thousands of Mr Ahmadinejad 's supporters marching through central Tehran .
But despite warnings by the authorities not to try to hijack the event , protesters shouted slogans in support of Mr Mousavi , a key opponent of the president .
Reports say there were clashes between police and protesters as the march progressed , with some arrests .
Stones were thrown , and police used tear gas .
Iranian state - run channel Press TV showed footage of an opposition rally , with many supporters wearing green , the colour adopted by supporters of Mr Mousavi .
Mr Mousavi was forced to leave the rally after his car was attacked , the official Irna news agency reported .
Witnesses said supporters helped Mr Mousavi into his car when hardliners approached and the vehicle sped away as a crowd tried to hold the hardliners back .
Reformist website Parlemennews.ir reported that Mr Khatami was pushed to the ground and his turban knocked off , before police intervened .
In his speech at Tehran University , Mr Ahmadinejad again criticised the creation of Israel .
British Foreign Secretary David Miliband said Mr Ahmadinejad 's denial of the Holocaust was " abhorrent as well as ignorant " .
" It is very important that the world community stands up against this tide of abuse , " Mr Miliband said .
The White House later added to the condemnation , calling Mr Ahmadinejad 's remarks " ignorant and hateful " .
Reporter for BBC Persian , Siavash Ardalan , said it was the first time since Iran 's Islamic Revolution in 1979 that opposition groups had tried to hijack the Quds Day rallies .
For the past 30 years , the sermon on Jerusalem Day has been given by former President Hashemi Rafsanjani .
Analysts say Mr Rafsanjani is normally regarded as a pillar of the Islamic power system , but he quietly sympathises with the opposition .
This year he has been stood down in favour of a hard - line preacher .
Mr Mousavi was defeated by President Ahmadinejad in June 's election , which opposition leaders claim was rigged .
In the aftermath , there was a violent crackdown on anti-government protesters , with a number of deaths and hundreds of people arrested .
SFMOMA gets Fisher art collection Partnership with family moves museum to forefront
Interior with Sun and Dog 1988 , oil on canvas , 60 " x 72 " by David Hockney Interior with Sun and Dog 1988 , oil on canvas , 60 " x 72 " by David Hockney Photo : David Hockney , Doris & Donald Fisher Collection Photo : David Hockney , Doris & Donald Fisher Collection Image 1 of / 24 Caption Close SFMOMA gets Fisher art collection 1 / 24 Back to Gallery
Doris and Donald Fisher have found a home for their monumental art collection at the San Francisco Museum of Modern
Art that will keep it in the city and elevate SFMOMA to one of the world 's leading showplaces of late 20th century art .
Placing the Fishers ' collection of 1,100 contemporary artworks - one of the finest in private hands anywhere - at the museum will put SFMOMA in the league of the Museum of Modern Art in New York and the Tate Modern in London and enhance the city as a destination for art lovers internationally .
A partnership agreement between the Fishers and the museum would bring under SFMOMA 's roof key works by artists such as Andy Warhol , Cy Twombly , Richard Serra , Roy Lichtenstein , Alexander Calder , Ellsworth Kelly , Willem de Kooning , Richard Diebenkorn and Chuck Close .
Market prices for such works make them unobtainable by museums except by donation .
Even in today 's lukewarm art economy , the Fisher collection probably would be appraised in nine figures .
Bitter opposition
The fate of the collection came into question this summer after bitter local opposition caused the Fishers to withdraw their 2007 proposal to build their own museum in the Presidio , a national park .
" To lose this would have been devastating , " Mayor Gavin Newsom told The Chronicle Thursday .
However , adding the Fisher collection to SFMOMA would require expanding the museum , which involves city permits , an environmental review and design plans , and the removal of a century - old building and a fire station .
The process could draw neighborhood and political opposition and most likely would take at least two years .
Newsom said he and others are working to fast - track the permitting process .
Incorporation of the collection into SFMOMA promises to enhance the cultural profile of the city itself .
" It certainly has that potential , " Dan Goldes of the San Francisco Convention and Visitors Bureau said .
" Eighty percent of tourists to San Francisco are repeat visitors , so ... things like this become vitally important in how we market the destination as one that 's continually renewing itself and staying vibrant . "
After the Presidio plan foundered , rumors began circulating that other cities were bidding for the collection .
As the Fisher family reportedly considered building or refurbishing a venue South of Market , they were already in conversation with the museum .
" It 's a handshake deal at this point , " said SFMOMA Director Neal Benezra , " but it 's based on months of discussion and on the Fisher family 's long history of helping to take this museum to the level where it is today .
...
There 's a lot of trust in place . "
The agreement with the Fishers comes as SFMOMA prepares to celebrate its 75th year in 2010 .
Standing ovation
" It received a long , standing ovation from the board , " said Benezra of the proposed arrangement , after he presented it Thursday to the museum 's trustees .
" But we have a lot of work to do to make this a reality , " adding that SFMOMA is developing a new , ground - up business plan .
" We have to demonstrate to ourselves and to the family that we can build something we can sustain . "
Donald Fisher serves on the SFMOMA board .
He and Doris and their son Robert , whose interest is photography , have long devoted time , energy and resources to the museum .
The Fishers had no comment Thursday on the agreement .
The partnership presumes the success of expansion plans announced by SFMOMA in April .
Estimated to cost $ 60 million , the museum 's plan calls for a new wing that would extend south to Howard Street and would add 100,000 square feet of gallery and public space , nearly tripling what now exists .
A ' partnership , ' not a gift
The museum already owns most of the land eyed for the extension .
SFMOMA calls the latest Fisher family benefaction a " partnership " rather than a gift , but the plan calls for interweaving works collected by the Fishers into displays of the museum 's own holdings , " where it makes sense , " Benezra said .
The Fisher family will form a trust , renewable in 25 years and administered in collaboration with the museum , to care for the Fisher collection .
The Fisher Trust , which apparently will own the collection , will consult closely and continually with SFMOMA 's curators and conservators , as the collections ' contents cut across art media .
SFMOMA already has on its calendar a summer 2010 exhibition in its existing space devoted to the Fisher collection .
The event will make the public aware of a collection known firsthand mostly by art world insiders .
White House officials and lawmakers were studying late Thursday how to keep alive the government 's cash - for - clunkers incentive program because of concerns the program 's $ 1 billion budget may have been exhausted after just one week .
Obama administration officials warned congressional leaders Thursday it planned to suspend the program at midnight .
But the White House released a statement late Thursday saying that completed deals would be honored and the program is still under review .

Repeated frantic searches of pockets are the best way to track down mislaid keys , passports , air tickets and credit cards , according to behavioural scientists .
After months spent studying holidaymakers at airport check - in desks , researchers from the University of Strathclyde have concluded that swearing , smacking children and shouting at other passengers also helps locate missing items .
One traveller admitted : ‘ It seemed hopeless until I lost my temper , tore off my jacket and ripped my inside pocket open and there was my passport .
I ’d looked in that pocket about eight times before and it was in there all the time !
What am I like ?’
Specially trained airport staff are being brought in to offer behaviour - supporting counselling to frenziedly self - searching passengers with key phrases like ‘ It must be in there somewhere ’ , ‘ Have you tried that pocket ? ’ and ‘ When did you last have it ? ’
The research also found that accusing other family members of deliberately moving items or leaving them behind can also speed the discovery of missing essentials , usually in the first place that was searched .
Professor Dougal Saltire is advising all travellers who have mislaid anything to furiously rummage through baggage and pat their pockets repeatedly .
He said : ‘ We ’ve no idea why but it seems to work in the end . ’
He went on : ‘ What seems at first glance to be a hysterical , chaotic outburst is in fact a genetically imprinted possession location process that can be traced back to at least the Romans and the many lost valuables that they recovered and did not mislay in pottery urns to be found many hundreds of years later . ’
The research group is also recommending that departing travellers follow their other instinct to go round their homes and check taps are off at least six times , with electrical plugs requiring a minimum of eight inspections by at least two members of the family .
A key senior figure in a Bush administration covert Pentagon program , which used retired military analysts to produce positive wartime news coverage , remains in the same position today as a chief Obama Defense Department spokesman and the agency ’s head of all media operations .
In an examination of Pentagon documents the New York Times obtained through a Freedom of Information Act request — which reporter David Barstow leveraged for his April 2008 Pulitzer Prize - winning exposé on the program – Raw Story has found that Bryan Whitman surfaces in over 500 emails and transcripts , revealing the deputy assistant secretary of defense for media operations was both one of the program ’s senior participants and an active member .
ADVERTISEMENT
Whitman ’s conspicuous presence in these records is notwithstanding thousands of documented communications the Bush Pentagon released but for which names were redacted and an untold number the prior administration successfully withheld after its two - year legal battle with the Times .
Barstow ’s
Times expose revealed a comprehensive , covert Pentagon campaign — beginning during the lead - up to the Iraq War and continuing through 2008 — that shaped network military analysts into what internal documents referred to as “ message force multipliers ” and “ surrogates ” who could be trusted to parrot Bush administration talking points “ in the form of their own opinions . ”
Barstow ’s reporting also detailed how most of the military analysts , traditionally viewed as authoritative and independent , had ties to defense contractors with a stake in the same war policies they were interpreting daily to the American public .
The program was ostensibly run out of the Pentagon ’s public affairs office for community relations , as part of its outreach , and attended to by political appointees , most visibly in these records by then community relations chief Allison Barber and director Dallas Lawrence .
But as Barstow noted in his report , in running the program out of that office rather than from the agency ’s regular press office , “ the decision recalled other Bush administration tactics that subverted traditional journalism . ”
In addition to concealing the true nature of the program and the retired military officers ’ participation in it , this tactic produced one other effect .
It provided Bryan Whitman , a career civil servant and senior Defense Department official who oversees the press office and all media operations , cover if and when the program was revealed .
ADVERTISEMENT
Additionally , while political appointees tend to come and go with each new administration , Whitman would be there before the program and he would be there after it .
His status as a career civil servant , the fact that he ’s worked for both Democratic and Republican administrations – something he points out often in public settings and did at the close of his recent phone interview with Raw Story — has also served to buffer him thus far from scrutiny regarding his involvement in this program .
In a conversation with Mr. Whitman , he denied any involvement or senior role in the program , saying he only had “ knowledge ” of its existence and called the assertion “ not accurate . ”
Asked to explain the hundreds of records showing otherwise , Mr. Whitman replied , “ No , I ’m familiar with those documents and I ’d just beg to differ with you , ” though he did acknowledge being in “ some ” of them .
ADVERTISEMENT
In defending his claim that he was n’t involved in the program , Whitman reiterated numerous times that since it was not run out of his office , it was not under “ my purview or my responsibility . ”
Yet records clearly reveal that Whitman was not only fully aware of the program ’s intent but also zealously pursued its goal of arming the military analysts with Pentagon talking points in an effort to dominate each relevant news cycle .
He was consulted regularly , doled out directives , actively participated and was constantly in the loop .
ADVERTISEMENT
Documented communications show that Whitman played a senior role in securing generals to brief the analysts , fashioned talking points to feed them , called analyst meetings to put out Pentagon and Bush administration PR fires , hosted meetings , determined which analysts should attend trips to wartime military sites ( such as the detention center at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba ) and received frequent , comprehensive reports detailing the analysts ’ impact on the air , in print and online .
In the Mix and Calling Shots
Records reveal Bryan Whitman as an ever - present force in the retired military analyst program , whether utilizing the analysts to push back against negative news coverage on insufficient body armor for soldiers , the abuse of detainees , setbacks in Iraq , and other incidents and war policies .
In David Barstow ’s Times expose , a prime example of how the Pentagon “ enlisted analysts as a rapid reaction force to rebut ” unfavorable coverage was illustrated in an email sent by “ a senior Pentagon official ” after news broke that troops in Iraq were dying because they had received insufficient body armor : “ I think our analysts – properly armed – can push back in that arena . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
That senior Pentagon official , documents show , was Bryan Whitman .
In the complete , unedited January 2006 email ( pdf link , p. 84 ) from Whitman ( he sometimes used “ military analyst ” or “ analyst ” when indicating the plural form “ analysts ” ) , he said :
“ In addition to all the nice work yesterday , I think it is still a good idea to have [ US Army Maj. Gen . ]
Sorenson do a phone call with the Military Analyst .
There were a number of critical Op - Ed pieces that popped up today and I think our analyst — properly armed — can push back in that arena .
We can set it all up , just need a time he could do it with a little advance notice to get them all on the phone . ”
Whitman sent this email directly to members of US Army Office for public affairs and cc’ed then Pentagon press secretary Eric Ruff and community relations chief Allison Barber .
The full communication details Whitman commending the team ’s initial efforts to push back against damaging news from the prior day , and defining the strategy and calling for a new military analyst meeting , with the additional directive “ [ w] e can set it all up . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The communication displays the range of Whitman ’s involvement , his facility within the program ’s fluid apparatus , his clout as a senior participant , as well as a full understanding of , and commitment to , its goals .
Other documents also expose Whitman ’s breadth and depth of participation and his direct impact on the program ’s success .
On March 9 , 2005 , the day before Vice Admiral Albert T. Church , a Naval Inspector General , testified before the Senate Armed Services Committee about his report on detainee detention operations and interrogation techniques , he briefed the military analysts .
Whitman hosted the analyst briefing ( pdf link , pages 1 - 13 ) .
Church led with his report ’s primary takeaway : “ [ W ]e found no policy that condoned or in any way considered torture ” or “ condoned or in any way encouraged abuse of detainees . ”
But he also told the analysts that “ interrogators were starting to clamp up and we were losing intelligence , ” a point he mentioned he omitted from the report but for which a “ debate ” was necessary .
ADVERTISEMENT
Whitman later opened up the floor to other officials who “ might be helpful for you tomorrow as you ’re having to talk through some of these issues . ”
A leader from the Office of Detainee Affairs ( whose name is redacted ) assured the analysts “ that from the beginning of the war on terrorism both the President and the Secretary of Defense made clear that all detainees would be treated humanely . ”
An Army official ( name also redacted ) followed by beginning , “ Gentlemen , let me give you kind of the big headline up front . ”
Whitman closed the military analyst meeting with a “ reminder of the ground rules ” that “ the information is embargoed until 7:00 a.m. tomorrow , with any direct attribution to Admiral Church when the testimony begins and no direct attribution to our other officials . ”
They were armed with their talking points before Church ’s testimony even began .
He also invited the analysts to give their “ feedback on doing this ahead of an event ” as “ opposed to after we ’ve announced something , ” with the additional solicitation “ [ i ] f it works for you under these type of conditions I think we would like to bring you in early on something . ”
ADVERTISEMENT
The following day , Church ’s report and testimony received withering criticism for failing to assess the accountability of senior officials involved in policies that led to abuse .
But that would n’t deter the military analysts , especially one of the Pentagon ’s most fervent and prolific members , Jed Babbin , former undersecretary of defense during the first Bush administration .
In his March 11 , 2005 New York Post op - ed column ( pdf link , pages 150 - 151 ) , the day after Church presented his report to Congress , Babbin published an article titled “ Torture Truths , ” in which he not only parroted talking points from the briefing but added his own personal touch , warning that the United States must “ reject the tide of political correctness that threatens to drown our interrogators . ”
That day , Whitman emailed the article to then Pentagon public affairs chief Larry Di Rita ( pdf link , p. 150 ) , making clear that they “ need to keep this dog fed . ”
And with Whitman ’s help , that ’s exactly what they did .
ADVERTISEMENT
In July 2005 , records show ( pdf link , pages 79 - 86 ) press secretary Eric Ruff contacting Whitman about a request from Babbin to interview Brigadier General Jay Hood — then the commander in charge of detainee operations at Guantanamo Bay — when Babbin filled in as host on “ The Mark Larson Show , ” a conservative radio program out of KOGO in San Diego .
Whitman replied , “ We can work it , ” adding , “ but I hope you are getting a cut of Babbins [ sic ] action as his agent . ”
In a following email to military public affair officials to secure Hood , Whitman assured them , “ As you probably know , Jed is very friendly and supportive . ”
Soon , Whitman had not only worked it but sealed the deal , writing to Ruff three days later , “ FYI – Hood is on with Babbin . ”
Throughout the records , Whitman and his team , in return , expressed their fealty to Babbin , realizing a pliant and tireless operative when they saw one .
ADVERTISEMENT
After members of Whitman ’s press office , including then director Roxie Merritt and deputy director Gary Keck , lined up an appearance for Babbin on “ The Bill O’Reilly Show ” to discuss detainee abuse allegations , Whitman , in a particularly effusive March 2005 email ( pdf link , p. 30 ) , commended his crew and gushed , “ Good work by all – Babbin will do us well – we should contact him and ask him if he needs anything – I will be happy to talk to him . ”
Clearly , however , records also show that Whitman and his colleagues knew when it was time to cut loose a wayward analyst .
When 14 marines died in Iraq on August 3 , 2005 , military analyst Bill Cowan , a Fox analyst and retired Marine colonel , was scheduled to appear on Fox ’s The O’Reilly Factor .
Whitman , along with other Pentagon public affairs officials involved in the program , received an email ( sent by a redacted source pdf link , p. 3 ) which said that Cowan “ wanted to give us a heads - up about what he ’s going to say ” and was also requesting “ anything and everything we can give him [ regarding ] the deaths of the marines . ”
Cowan , though , who Barstow reported had grown frustrated with the Pentagon program , also noted that his comments “ may not all be friendly . ”
In another email , Whitman offered , “ I ’ll talk to him if you like . ”
Within a couple of hours , Whitman also confirmed that he had arranged for one of two generals to speak with Cowan .
ADVERTISEMENT
Though in this case , Whitman ’s efforts notwithstanding , Cowan ( Barstow also detailed ) went too far off script for the Pentagon ’s liking when he said that America “ is not on a good glide path right now . ”
Cowan told Barstow that the Pentagon “ simply did n’t like the fact that I was n’t carrying their water ” so he was “ precipitously fired from the analysts group ” after the appearance .
Other documented communications illustrate Whitman ’s shaping and sanctioning program activities such as an August 2005 email ( pdf link , p. 95 ) , which shows Whitman as one of four senior Pentagon officials to approve the list of attendees for a scheduled military analyst trip to the Guantanamo Bay detention center .
“ I ’ve attached the list discussed and agreed to between Cully , Mr. Smith , Bryan Whitman , and Mr. Haynes , ” the sender ( name redacted ) wrote to then head of community relations Allison Barber .
The other three senior Pentagon officials cited include , at the time , acting assistant secretary of defense for public affairs Dorrance Smith , general counsel WJ Haynes and deputy assistant secretary of defense for detainee affairs Charles Cully .
Time and again , records show Whitman in the mix , championing the program .
“ The analyst[s ] are back from Iraq and starting to make do [ sic ] their thing – very positive contribution to the reporting , ” Whitman crowed in this December 2005 email ( pdf link , p. 106 ) , on the success of the military analysts latest excursion and subsequent on - air offensive .
And throughout , Whitman is consulted on what messaging to spoon feed them , such as in this October 2006 email from Barber ( pdf link , p. 115 ) : “ Do we have an official line for the military analysts on this ? ”
Records also show that Whitman , along with his colleagues in the program , received regular summaries and extensive systematic reports detailing the military analysts impact around the networks , on the radio , in print and online , as in this excerpt from one such typical email from February 2005 ( pdf link , p. 97 ) , addressed ( from a redacted source ) directly to some of the usual senior officials involved in the program – Di Rita , Whitman , Barber and Ruff — and cc’d to dozens of others :
“ TV Broadcast Summary : Analysts Tommy Franks , Jed Babbin , Don Shepperd , Montgomery Meigs and Jack Jacobs were all featured on national news stations ( Fox News , CNN and MSNBC ) .
Generally speaking , all agreed that the election was not as violent as expected and that the Iraqi security forces and American troops did a very good job .
Several analysts alluded to the fact that there will be more danger ahead .
The analyst mood was positive as Iraqi events unfolded .
… The attached memo provides information on what each analyst said and how often they appeared on television . ”
Whitman even proved a creative force in getting the most out of the analysts , seeing opportunities even in a national disaster , such as Hurricane Katrina .
Two days after Katrina hit the Gulf Coast , then community relations director Dallas Lawrence wrote to Whitman ( pdf link , p. 6 ) , “ Bryan , per our chat , at the conclusion of our conference call this afternoon with Bg Hemingway , I pulsed our analysts to see if there would be an interest in a 4:15 call today to discuss the DoD response to Katrina .
… There was a universal positive response , several said they have been doing radio interviews throughout the day and have been asked several times , what DoD , specifically , is doing . ”
Lawrence concluded the email by thanking Whitman and confirming that an RSVP list for the military analyst meeting on Katrina would arrive soon .
Part II of this expose will explore how the Pentagon press office and community relations worked in tandem on the military analyst program , and how “ information dominance ” drove not only this project but the embed program for reporters , about which Bryan Whitman admits he was “ heavily involved in the process . ”

Follow - up : Why You Say You 're Still Buying So Many CDs
Earlier :
It 's easy to forget that old tech dies hard .
The latest example : Still 65 % of all music sold in the U.S. this year is via compact disc , while digital downloads are just 35 % , research firm NPD Group announced today .
That 's down from 80 % CDs and 20 % digital in 2007 .
But for someone who sits in the digital bubble all day , it still feels jarringly high .
So I 'm curious .
Really .
Why are you still buying so many CDs ?
I can see why some need to be purchased .
I 've personally bought two this calendar year -- one because it included a bonus disc and movie that were n't available for download ; and one because I was at a concert and wanted the up - and - coming artist to get as much of my money as possible .
But I ripped both in iTunes immediately , and I do n't even know where the original discs are right now .
And those kinds of purchases can't be enough to add up to 65 % of the market .
( And as for me , pretty much everything else comes from Amazon and iTunes .
I can't even remember the last time I saw a CD in a store . )
So what 's the actual reason we 're still buying CDs ?
It 's not like they 're cheaper .
To play in the car ?
To play in home stereo ?
To rip and do both ?
I 'm honestly curious .
I think I can give you an executive summary of this blog post : if the documentation for an open source project sucks , nobody but the most hardcore developers will use it .
What has prompted this incredibly brilliant stating - of - the - obvious ?
The reaction by those in the Twisted community over Facebook 's pre-emptive strike in the non-blocking Python - based web server space by open sourcing a framework they are using internally called Tornado .
Why are the Twisted folks getting all twisted ( look how funny I am ! ) up about this ?
Like any good Open Source project for people who are interested in Getting Things Done , Tornado is dissing Twisted by basically saying " yeah , we thought about using Twisted but it was n't easy enough for us to use and we think it sucks " .
I 'm pretty sure I 'm paraphrasing here , but you get the idea .
Now , I have looked at Twisted and have come to the following conclusions :
It looks awesome
It is built for people who are supposed to understand what they are doing
The documentation sucks
The examples on how to build anything of any significance are , to this developer , non-existant and / or difficult to find without shelling out for a possibly very - outdated book
It looks awesome
It is built for people who are supposed to understand what they are doing
The documentation is inside the comments on the code which sucks only if you 're not into reading the code
It includes a sample application so you can see something other than Hello World
Contrast this with Tornado .
I 've looked at Tornado and have come to the following conclusions :
Am I biased towards Tornado ?
You bet .
Why ?
Because as hard as I tried , I could not find USEFUL documentation on how to build things using Twisted .
Maybe I did n't use the right search terms .
Maybe I did n't dig down enough links deep on the Twisted site .
Maybe I did n't fully understand the terminology or architecture of Twisted and how they different components speak to each other .
I 'll tell you this though : I am not having any such problems with Tornado .
This is coming across as a criticism aimed towards Twisted , and I suppose that 's fair .
I 've noticed complaints from the Twisted community which really amount to whining .
I understand that attitude totally .
I 've been there , when faced with competition that just might be doing a better job then I am doing .
But complaining that Facebook should 've simply fixed up Twisted instead of writing their own is not productive .
Productive is understanding that Facebook looking at Twisted and said " this is not for us because * we* do n't find it easy enough to use " is a sign that something serious is wrong with Twisted 's documentation .
You could have the most awesome non-blocking web server available , but if people with who WANT to use it can't figure out HOW to use it , well , what can you say to that ?
Only the most dedicated open source contributors would 've done that .
Most will say " meh , I want to do this myself so I understand it " and then Twisted will die an obscure death while Tornado plunges forward gaining mindshare amongst people interested in the type of applications you can build with this technology .
In my opinion , it 's all because of the lack of clear , freely available documentation for Twisted .
If there is an online source BETTER than the Twisted site , please share the link love in the comments so I can try and do a better comparison of the two at a documentation level .
For someone like me , who is new to Python but old to the idea of web frameworks , I think that would be the fairest comparison .
It 's no secret that iPhone owners in the US are often unhappy with their AT&T service .
Dropped calls , low signal , and totally slow - data 3G data speed are all part of the iPhone experience .
But if you live in Charlotte , NC , we have good news !
AT&T just started rolling out its 3G MicroCell in the Charlotte market , with other areas presumably to follow .
This is how it works : you buy a 3G MicroCell adapter which connects to your DSL / cable router ( or presumably your Ethernet connection at work ) .
This adapter increases the signal strength of your 3G phone by allowing you to make calls using the Internet connection .
So , you get full bars of service in your home , regardless of your cell - tower proximity .
Up to four devices can use the MicroCell at one time .
Additionally , your data connections will be faster ( although we do n't know how it would be any different than just using the WiFi for data access on its own ) .
The MicroCell is $ 150 , and service is free ( at least in the Charlotte trial ) , though if you want to make unlimited calls from your MicroCell , you 'll need to pay another $ 20 per month .
The whole solution is pretty similar to T - Mobile 's Hotspot@Home system ( although that will work with any WiFi router , provided your phone supports WiFi ) and is similar to offerings from Sprint and Verizon ( although neither Sprint or Verizon offer 3G data speeds ) .
So AT&T users , are you willing to pay $ 150 for a device that offers better signal quality and faster connection speeds ?
Oil - Funded Group That Targeted Green Jobs Czar Now After Steven Chu
September 13th , 2009 by Susan Kraemer
The DOE is headed up by Steven Chu , who has totally revamped the Department of Energy from a fossil friendly enterprise to one that moves us swiftly off of oil and coal and towards more home grown renewable power like solar and wind .
The Heartland Institute and the Competitive Enterprise Institute are oil - funded think - tanks dedicated to turning out academic - appearing reports that have successfully confused Americans about global warming .
The result has been that oil companies have successfully delayed renewable energy development in this country .
Like Americans For Prosperity and FreedomWorks , which was behind the firing of Van Jones , the Green Jobs Czar ; these organizations are funded by Exxon and David and Charles Koch ( Koch Industries oil empire ) .
Freedom works is currently sponsoring astroturf townhalls to fight energy legislation .
The plot thickens … they now have Steven Chu in their sights .
The Huffington Post caught them gloating :
On Fox News forum ; Phil Kerpen the director of policy for Americans For Prosperity brags about how his organization brought down Van Jones : “ I spent the next two weeks researching everything I could find about Jones and the Apollo Alliance ( much of which is still to be published , including a forthcoming paper from the Capital Research Center next month ) , the national umbrella organization for coordinating between the environmentalists , the labor unions , and the social justice street organizers that Jones has served as a board member and a primary national spokesman for . ”
Now that they have tasted blood , the scope of Enemies Of America has widened .
According to a document uncovered by Enviroknow , they have shifted their sights to includes … yikes !
It ’s Steven Chu .
Could that be because our new Department of Energy is the most proactive since Jimmy Carter on climate and renewable energy .
Steven
Chu has efficiently initiated a burst of more funding of renewable energy than many VCs in Silicon Valley .
Govt Picks a Winner : Tesla Gets $ 465 Million
President Obama : $ 800 Million for Biofuels and Flex - Fuel Vehicles
President Obama Announces $ 2.4 Billion in Funding for Electric Vehicles
Solyndra Solar Wins First DOE Fnding
Obama Unveils Largest - Ever Investment in Advanced Batteries
Another Day , Another Humungous Renewable Energy Funding Announcement From DOE
Obama Announces US $ 467 M in Stimulus Funding for Geothermal and Solar Energy Projects
Obama Commits $ 13 billion for High Speed Rail
Why , it ’s downright Anti-American .
But – whereas Van Jones was will still be just as effective a Green Jobs organizer in the non-profit world – it would be extremely difficult to replace someone of the caliber of Nobel prizewinner Steven Chu at the DOE .

When masochism just is n’t enough
Our new AWE course is about to go live for the first time , in BlackHat Vegas .
We chose the most interesting exploitation cases we ’ve encountered , and dove really deep into them .
We had many exploits to choose from , some were too easy , and believe it or not , some were just too hard .
This blog post is going to be a multipart post , describing our exploitation process of the recent iTunes overflow described here .
This is possibly one of our most involved and interesting exploits to date .
An exploit for OSX was released and discussed here .
Being naturally inquisitive , we checked to see if this exception would occur in Windows too , and indeed it was !
After attaching a debugger to the iTunes process , we noticed it was getting terminated after around 30 seconds .
It looked like iTunes had anti-debugging features implemented .
Fortunately , Immunity Debugger offers anti-debugging scripts which are useful for situations just like this .
Invoking the ! hidedebug command within ID allowed the debugger to continue running in hidden mode , bypassing our first hurdle .
Using the OSX exploit as a template , we attempted to crash iTunes several times , however the process would keep terminating with no opportunity for code redirection .
After inspecting the call stack in one of the crash cases , we saw that one function was calling ZwTerminateProcess .
We assumed this was a stack protection mechanism .
We placed a breakpoint there .
This would halt ID just before the stack cookie check , allowing us to examine the vulnerable function in greater depth , and also to confirm our “ stack protection ” theory .
We soon realised that trying to approach the stack canary head on would be difficult .
We attempted to increase the buffer length we were sending in order to get a SEH overflow , which would effectively bypass the canary protection .
The Gods of buffer overflows were in our favour – and an SEH overwrite was achieved !
From here on , we expected things to get easier .
Little did we know … .
( to be continued next week …)
Our working exploit can be found here .
England 's exams watchdog hired consultants to come up with alternatives to the word " error " amid concerns it had negative connotations , it was disclosed today .
Ofqual also admitted it had " shied away " from talking about reliability in testing due to fears about negative headlines damaging public confidence .
The regulator was established by ministers to improve and maintain public confidence in qualifications and assessments .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
It said it aimed to " encourage debate " about topics such as standards .
In a speech to the International Association for Educational Assessment conference in Brisbane this week , Ofqual head of standards Dennis Opposs said : " Why have we previously shied away from communicating much about reliability in public ?
" Well it is a complex idea that is hard to explain .
We have worried in the past that negative news stories about it could damage public confidence .
" On the other hand should n't assessment organisations be transparent and communicate with the public about measurement inaccuracy ? "
Mr Opposs said the watchdog had paid communications consultants Blue Rubicon to produce " a narrative for Ofqual staff to use when speaking about reliability and unreliability " .
As part of this work they were instructed to come up with suitable replacements for the word " error " to describe discrepancies in exam marking .
A report presented by Mr Opposs at the conference said : " It was necessary to choose an alternative term to ' error ' as this was too closely associated with culpability , and because it had an unhelpfully subtle word grammar . "
The word " variation " was chosen as the best alternative , ahead of suggestions including variance , uncertainty , discrepancy , inconsistency or clash .
The report says : " ' Clash ' is probably not close enough in meaning to unreliability and also has the potential to provide incendiary headlines . "
There have been continuing concerns in recent years about the reliability of marking in public exams and school tests .
Ofqual chairman Kathleen Tattersall has said previously that the public still have " unrealistic " expectations of England 's exams system , and must realise there will always be human error involved in marking .

To ensure that our privacy remains at least as strong online as it is in the physical world , Google needs to do more .
With the ACLU of Northern California and the Samuelson Clinic at UC Berkeley , EFF has written a letter to Google CEO Eric Schmidt , demanding that Google take specific steps to protect your freedom to read privately .
We 've asked that Google only respond to legitimate warrants when the government comes calling , for example , and to quickly delete any information they gather about your searching for and browsing in books .
Now , we need you to join us in the fight to defend reader privacy — take action and tell Eric Schmidt that you demand the same privacy for your online reading habits that you enjoy when reading paper .
As Michael Chabon , author of The Yiddish Policemen ’s Union : A Novel , put it : " If there is no privacy of thought — which includes implicitly the right to read what one wants , without the approval , consent or knowledge of others — then there is no privacy , period . "
If Google wants to be worthy of its goal of organizing and making accessible the world 's knowledge , then it needs to respect its audience by not stockpiling private information about who we are and what we read , and not becoming a one - stop shop for government fishing expeditions into the reading habits of Americans .
Send a message and stand up for the future of reader privacy now .
Swine Flu Cuts the Kiss in Europe Swine flu worries have eliminated some honored traditions , especially in Europe .
Sept. 9 , 2009  --
The first news of swine flu this spring brought out the germaphobes in cultures worldwide -- the fearful in Hong Kong donned face masks , Egypt ordered the slaughter of pigs and entire schools in the United States closed their doors .
Now that the annual flu season is looming over the Northern Hemisphere , fears of the H1N1 virus are nixing some time honored cultural traditions , especially in Europe .
In France , la bise , the cheek - to - cheek peck that the French use to say hello or goodbye , is a national tradition .
For the French , it 's just like buying a baguette at the local boulangerie or taking their summer holiday in August .
But these days , this tradition is being put in parenthesis due to the global threat of swine flu .
Some French schools and companies are telling students and employees to avoid the social ritual out of fear the swine flu pandemic could spread as winter approaches .
The French government is not calling for an outright ban of the bise .
But the Health Ministry , on its Web site dedicated to the swine flu pandemic , recommends avoiding " all direct contacts between people and particularly with sick people : do not kiss , do not shake hands ( … ) " .
The French government has launched a broad public awareness campaign on the swine flu pandemic .
TV and radio spots are informing people of the basic rules to stop the virus from spreading , such as encouraging people to wash their hands frequently or to cough into their sleeves or tissues and not into their hands .
However , the mayor of the town of Guilvinec in the western region of Brittany has banned the bise in schools .
" In the process of prevention of a flu epidemic , it was meaningless to ask children to wash their hands several times a day , to sneeze in certain conditions , to blow their nose using disposable tissues , et cetera … while , at the same time , we would let the kids keep kissing each other , " Hélène Tanguy , the mayor of Guilvinec , told ABCNews.com .
Instead , the teaching staff found other alternatives to the bise , such as teaching kids that not all peoples kiss each other to say hello or goodbye .
For example , kids are greeting each other by raising their hand , just like " Native Americans who do n't kiss each other , " Tanguy explained .
New " bise boxes " containing heart - shaped pieces of paper are meant to make up for the lack of affection provided by a kiss .
" Children write their names on the piece of paper and bring it to the person they wish to kiss , " the mayor said .
Swine Flu Threats in the United States
Infectious disease experts in the United States believe the French may have a point in toning down the traditional affections this year .
" I will tell you that in our medical center there are people who are touching elbows , there are people who not from the Indian subcontinent that are doing the hand clasped and bow greeting of Namaste , " said Dr. William Schaffner , chairman of the department of preventive medicine at the Vanderbilt University School of Medicine .
" I do n't want the hugging police to be out there , but just to encourage people to recognize they have a role in maintaining their own health and the health of others , " said Schaffner .
Several French companies have also asked employees to refrain from kissing the cheeks of their fellow colleagues when arriving at work .
" We 've been asked to be vigilant and to refrain from kissing each other on the cheeks " Gerard Burion , who works for a telecom company in Levallois - Perret , outside Paris , told ABCNews.com .
" I 'm careful .
I try to control myself , but often I can't and I kiss my colleagues as this is an old habit of our society " he continued .
" But then we say , ' I still gave you a kiss on the cheeks but do n't forget next time , we wo n't do it . ' "
" We 've also been asked to stop shaking hands .
And I must admit that this is a good measure as a lot of germs are spread this way , " he said .
Pierre de Surville who works for an IT consulting group in Levallois told ABCNews.com , " We 've received the recommendation from the management team to no longer give the bise and it looks like it will become an obligation if the situation gets worse . "
" But for now , nothing has changed for me , " said de Surville .
Some are even going further .
At the end of last month , the mayor of Coulaines , in western France , issued a decree that bans spitting on public streets as a way to prevent the spread of germs linked to swine flu ( the H1N1 virus ) .
The mayor even wrote to the president of the French soccer federation asking him to encourage players to no longer give the " bad example " by spitting on soccer fields .
France has so far confirmed three swine flu deaths .
According to the Health Ministry , 5,000 people contracted the disease the last week of August .
But health officials fear a fast progression of swine flu cases in the coming weeks .
In recent days , several classrooms and schools around France have been shut after cases of swine flu emerged .
As for the United States , students returning to school this week from the Labor Day holiday were inundated with material about preventing the spread of the H1N1 flu .
Are Schools in the U.S. Prepared , or Overprepared ?
About 55 million students and 7 million staff attend more than 130,000 public and private schools in the United States each day , according to the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention .
Schools looking to stem the spread of flu have always turned to the government for guidance and with the swine flu , the CDC is distributing more advice than ever on things like the importance of washing hands and keep ill students home sick during flu season .
In more extreme outbreaks , the CDC encourages educators to " try innovative ways of separating students .
These can be as simple as moving desks farther apart or canceling classes that bring together children from different classrooms . "
But educators walk a fine line between imposing public health advice and encouraging children to work together .
The Glen Cove School District on New York 's Long Island found itself under the media microscope this week after children told New York City area reporters that students were warned against giving or receiving high - fives or hugs this fall .
" There is no policy , there was no policy , there never was a policy -- there was simply a discussion about contact about passing along the swine flu , " said Laurence W. Aronstein , superintendent of the Glen Cove School District .
Swine Flu Precautions in Church : No Kissing ?
As with schools and businesses , Europeans may be taking more swine flu precautions in church than Americans are .
Each year devout Roman Catholics in Naples , Italy , honor the time - honored ritual of kissing a vial of blood from the city 's patron Saint Gennaro .
St. Gennaro 's dried blood is said to liquefy twice a year , a full 17 centuries after his martyr death .
However , in light of the swine flu , Roman Catholic and city authorities forbid the kissing .
On Sept. 19 , the faithful will only be allowed to touch the vial with their foreheads , according to reporting from Reuters .
While Italians have stopped kissing one of Naples ' most sacred relics , the United States Conference of Bishops said churches on this side of the Atlantic have n't made any drastic changes in light if the H1N1 virus .
Swine Flu and the Catholic Mass
" In terms of Mass , we 're not making any national change at the moment .
But some local bishops may choose to make some specific policies , " said the Rev. Rick Hilgartner , associate director of the Secretariat of Divine Worship for the United States Conference of Bishops .
Hilgartner said parishioners and priests should always follow proper hygiene -- refraining from the communion chalice if you feel ill , or washing your hands before ministering communion -- regardless of the swine flu threat .
But last spring Hilgartner said some Bishops took extra measures when news of Swine Flu hit , and they may do so again this fall .
" Many local bishops said that that the sign of peace would be suspended in least in terms of shaking hands , " said Hilgartner .
" Some bishops recommended receiving communion only in the hand , " he said , adding that asking a parishioner to not open their mouth for communion is a serious request in the Roman Catholic Church .
" But I think that would be only put in place if there was a perceived need for extreme caution , " said Hilgartner .
For all the sacrificed social rituals , or religious rites , some infectious experts say a little common sense may go much further in preventing swine flu this fall .
Which Restrictions Matter When Stopping Swine Flu
" I think social restrictions very hard to enforce .
We can't really live in a bubble and we 're social beings , " said Dr. Dalilah Restrepo , an infectious disease expert at St. Luke 's - Roosevelt Hospital in New York City .
" The common sense advice of washing your hands and using your sanitizer is definitely going to be the gold standard , " said Restrepo .
" And I can tell you from other viral infections the best thing is the vaccine . "
But , Restrepo pointed out , the world will have to wait to see how well the H1N1 vaccines will prevent the spread of the swine flu this year .

Семен Шапкин
Не так давно мы писали о скандале , случившемся с сотрудником британского консульства в
Екатеринбурге - он засветился на оргиях с местными девицами легкого поведения .
И вот в Рунете появилось новое скандальное видео , запечатлевшее амурные похождения уже одного из американских дипломатов в Москве .
Кто его снял , не знаем , но факт неопровержимый : второй секретарь политического отдела посольств а США в Москве Кайл Хатчер , солидный женатый человек , в свободное от работы и от семейной жизни время вовсю балуется с " цыпочками " .
Это можно было бы считать его личным делом , однако есть в этом деле одно " но " : по роду занятий в посольств е
Хатчер отвечает за вопросы религии и поддерживает официальные контакты с иерархами религиозных конфессий в России .
В том числе , на самом высоком уровне .
Ловко устроился этот посольский : общается со священнослужителями , прихожанами православных , мусульманских , иудейских общин , рассуждает о свободе совести - и одновременно ходит по " амурным " адресам в
Москве и других российских городах .
А там у него уже другой круг общения : Инна , Соня , Вероника ...
Кстати , как пишут в Рунете , некоторые московские знакомые за глаза называют мистера Хатчера « наш пастор Шлаг » .
Мол , не простой он дипломат , и заниматься сутанами да рясами ему поручили вовсе не в госдепартаменте , а в американском ведомстве " плаща и кинжал а " - ЦРУ .
Как относятся к такому " трудовому графику " своего коллеги в посольстве США ( если , конечно , там в курсе ) - дело самих американцев .
Но сомнительно , что представители российских конфессий , узнай они об " увлечениях " второго секретар я
Хатчера , захотелии бы иметь с ним дело дальше .
Walter and Eliza Hall Institute scientists have created a weakened strain of the malaria parasite that will be used as a live vaccine against the disease .
The vaccine , developed in collaboration with researchers from the US , Japan and Canada , will be trialled in humans from early next year .
Malaria kills more than one million people each year and destroys – through premature death and disability – the equivalent of at least 35 million years of healthy , productive human life every year .
Professor Alan Cowman , head of the institute 's Infection and Immunity division , said in developing the vaccine the research team had deleted two key genes in the Plasmodium falciparum parasite – which causes the form of malaria most deadly to humans .
By removing the genes the malaria parasite is halted during its liver infection phase , preventing it from spreading to the blood stream where it can cause severe disease and death .
Their success in genetically modifying the parasite and thereby preventing its invasion of red blood cells is published in the current issue of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences USA .
Professor Cowman said similar vaccines had been tested in mice and offered 100 per cent protection against malaria infection .
He said it was hoped the vaccine would produce similar results in humans .
" Although two genes have been deleted the parasite is still alive and able to stimulate the body 's protective immune system to recognize and destroy incoming mosquito - transmitted deadly parasites , " Professor Cowman said .
This approach to vaccine development – using a weakened form of the whole organism that causes a particular disease – has proven successful in eradicating smallpox and controlling diseases such as flu and polio .
Professor Cowman said the research team , which includes Dr Matthew O'Neill and Dr Alex Maier from the institute as well as scientists from the Seattle Biomedical Research Institute , the Walter Reed Army Institute for Research and the University of Maryland , had used knowledge from several decades ago – when scientists proved that irradiated malaria parasites provide protection against subsequent malaria infection in animal models and humans – in developing the vaccine .
" Although vaccines are under development that use whole malaria parasites weakened by irradiation to protect against infection , their safety and effectiveness rely on a precise irradiation dose and trial results have been variable , " Professor Cowman said .
" We believe that our genetically attenuated parasite approach provides a safe and reproducible way of developing a whole organism malaria vaccine . "
Professor Cowman said it was unlikely the weakened parasites used in the vaccine would regain their potency as the genes had been deleted from the genome and could not be recreated by the parasite .
" In addition , the ' one - two punch ' approach of deleting two essential genes make it extremely unlikely that the attenuated parasite vaccine could restore its capacity to multiply and lead to disease , " he said .
The human trials of the vaccine will take place at the Walter Reed Army Institute of Research in Maryland , US .
The genetically attenuated parasites to be used in the trial are being manufactured at the Walter and Eliza Hall Institute , which has the only facility worldwide capable of producing genetically - altered malaria parasites that comply with the good manufacturing practice guidelines required for human clinical trials .
The research is supported by a US $ 17 million , five - year grant from the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation .
If the ongoing social networking revolution has you scratching your head and asking , " Why do people spend time on this ? " and " How can my company benefit from the social network revolution ? " you 've got a lot in common with Harvard Business School professor Mikolaj Jan Piskorski .
Only difference : Piskorski has spent years studying users of online social networks ( SN ) and has developed surprising findings about the needs that they fulfill , how men and women use these services differently , and how Twitter — the newest kid on the block — is sharply different from forerunners such as Facebook and MySpace .
He has also applied many of the insights to help companies develop strategies for leveraging these various online entities for profit .
Addressing Network Failures
" Online social networks are most useful when they address real failures in the operation of offline networks , " says Piskorski .
They can address some basic search failures : " It 's hard to know what my friends are up to , but online I can catch up with them quickly . "
But they can also fix bigger search shortcomings , such as those related to establishing new relationships .
" If I am looking for someone who can help me with my start up , I would ask my friends if they know such a person , and if they do n't , I would ask them to inquire with their friends .
The problem is that those friends of friends do n't always have an incentive to help , so they wo n't work on my behalf .
But here is where Linked In comes in handy — there I can go and search through the network of my friends of friends and find the person I am looking for . "
Online social networks also can improve people 's ability to use offline social networks as " covers . "
This is very salient on LinkedIn .
There , people display a lot of information about their careers , which makes them available to headhunters and other employers as passive candidates .
But they also establish relationships with others to stay in touch with peers and to make new contacts .
This network allows them to establish plausible deniability that they are not looking for a job , even if they are .
Empirical Evidence
With these general ideas of why people use these sites , Piskorski examined weblogs of social networking sites ( not Linked In ) to see what people did when they were online .
" I just wondered why people spend so much time on these sites ; what do they do ? "
The biggest discovery : pictures .
" People just love to look at pictures , " says Piskorski .
" That 's the killer app of all online social networks .
Seventy percent of all actions are related to viewing pictures or viewing other people 's profiles . "
Why the popularity of photos ?
Piskorski hypothesizes that people who post pictures of themselves can show they are having fun and are popular without having to boast .
Another draw of photos ( and of SN sites in general ) is that they enable a form of voyeurism .
In real life there is a strong norm against prying into other people 's lives .
But online enables " a very delicate way for me to pry into your life without really prying , " the researcher says .
" Harvard undergrads do it all the time .
They know all about each other before they meet face to face .
' Oh , you 're that guy that did that internship in D.C. last summer . ' "
Piskorski has also found deep gender differences in the use of sites .
The biggest usage categories are men looking at women they do n't know , followed by men looking at women they do know .
Women look at other women they know .
Overall , women receive two - thirds of all page views .
" This was a very big surprise : A lot of guys in relationships are looking at women they do n't know , " says Piskorski .
" It 's an easy way to see if anyone might be a better match . "
Again , online networks act as cover .
Then Came Twitter
Piskorski says these findings do not hold for one network : Twitter .
Looking at who uses Twitter , which restricts users to 140 - character messages , Piskorski and student - researcher Bill Heil ( HBS MBA '09 ) found that 90 percent of Twitter posts were created by only 10 percent of users .
This was not surprising , he says , because the technology uses words without photos to communicate .
" Only the people who are willing to put themselves out there publicly in words to people who they may not know will use Twitter .
Some people will find this incredibly appealing , others will find this too scary . "
“ Women actually say things , guys give references to other things . ”
But the remarkable finding was the gender dynamics .
According to the research , there are more women on Twitter than men , women tweet about the same rate as men , but men's tweets are followed by both sexes much more than expected by chance .
" That was stunning because on all these other social networks you see the opposite , " Piskorski says .
Piskorski and Heil are now doing a follow up study to see whether this is because there are no pictures on Twitter or because men and women say different things .
Early results suggest that women create fewer links in their tweets than men .
" Women actually say things , guys give references to other things . "
But even accounting for these differences , the researchers still saw differences between how men and women are followed , perhaps pointing to a fundamental representation of the role of men and women in society .
" No One Uses Myspace "
To continue on the issue of online representation of offline societal trends , Piskorski also looked at usage patterns of MySpace .
Today 's perception is that Twitter has the buzz and Facebook has the users .
MySpace ?
Dead ; no one goes there anymore .
Tell a marketer that she ought to have a MySpace strategy and she 'll look at you like you have a third eye .
But Piskorski points out that MySpace has 70 million U.S. users who log on every month , only somewhat fewer than Facebook 's 90 million and still more than Twitter 's 20 million in the U.S.
Its user base is not really growing , but 70 million users is nothing to sneeze at .
So why does n't MySpace get the attention it deserves ?
The fascinating answer , acquired by studying a dataset of 100,000 MySpace users , is that they largely populate smaller cities and communities in the south and central parts of the country .
Piskorski rattles off some MySpace hotspots : " Alabama , Arkansas , West Virginia , Oklahoma , Kentucky , Florida . "
They are n't in Dallas but they are in Fort Worth .
Not in Miami but in Tampa .
They 're in California , but in cities like Fresno .
In other words , not anywhere near the media hubs ( except Atlanta ) and far away from those elite opinion - makers in coastal urban areas .
“ You need to shift your mindset from social media to social strategy . ”
" MySpace has a PR problem because its users are in places where they do n't have much contact with people who create news that gets read by others .
Other than that , there is really no difference between users of Facebook and MySpace , except they are poorer on MySpace . "
Piskorski recently blogged on his findings .
From Social Media To Social Strategy
Corporate marketers by and large struggle with how to use social networking sites to reach potential customers , says Piskorski , who advises companies on this subject .
The problem is that execs think of online social networks as social media and treat it as another channel to get people to click through to a site .
It does n't work that way .
For one thing , findings show that people do n't click through on advertising on social networks .
" A good analogy is to imagine sitting at a table with friends when a stranger pulls up a chair , sits down , and tries to sell you something while you are talking to your friends .
You will not get far with a strategy like this . "
" To be successful , you need to shift your mindset from social media to social strategy , " he continues .
A good social strategy essentially uses the same principles that made online social networks attractive in the first place — by solving social failures in the offline world .
Firms should begin to do the same and help people fulfill their social needs online .
To continue the earlier analogy , " You should come to the table and say , ' Here is a product that I have designed for you that is going to make you all better friends . '
To execute on this , firms will need to start making changes to the products themselves to make them more social , and leverage group dynamics , using technologies such as Facebook Connect .
But I do n't see a lot of that yet .
I see ( businesses ) saying , ' Let 's talk to people on Twitter or let 's have a Facebook page or let 's advertise . '
And these are good first steps but they are nowhere close to a social strategy . "
Classic comic book covers get reinterpreted by modern artists on Covered , a fascinating blog that puts a graphic spin on a musical tradition .
“ It ’s like a jazz musician playing a standard , ” said Robert Goodin , 38 , the illustrator and lifelong comics fan who runs the site .
“ We get to come in and make something our own that we do n’t have to build from scratch .
It ’s nice to do something where many of the decisions have already been made by somebody else and the artist is free to riff on it . ”
Goodin , who lives in Hollywood and works on the American Dad television show , launched Covered in January .
He receives between five and 15 submissions a week , so they ca n’t all be the comic book equivalent of John Coltrane ’s “ My Favorite Things . ”
Curating the collection , which includes fairly straightforward revisions as well as bizarre interpretations that take the original artwork in cool new directions , takes real effort , Goodin told Wired.com in an e-mail interview .
“ The least enjoyable part of doing this is rejecting covers sent to me , ” he said .
“ But I think the best use the original as a starting point and then take it somewhere unexpected . ”
Read on for Goodin ’s take on 10 of his favorite submissions to Covered .
Above :
“ Since the age of computer coloring came into mainstream superhero comics in the ’ 90s , ” Goodin said , “ colorists have gone haywire with their almost infinite tools .
They often will use too many colors , gradients , solar flares and any other Photoshop trick they can find , so the results are often murky messes that are impossible to make out from more than two feet away .
“ But Eric is a graphic designer and responsible for many of the great DVD covers of the Criterion Collection .
He understands the power of a limited palette and has an understanding that one of the first priorities of a good cover is for it to be clear ( unless of course , you do n’t want it to be ) .
Everything about this cover screams pain , from Superman ’s expression , which was equally captured in the original , to the hot color palette , to the expressionistic line .
Superman looks like he is burning in a star ; the image screams at you from across the room in more ways than one . ”

Venom : Lethal Protector No. 1 , covered by Jon Vermilyea
This startling revision was an immediate win , according to Goodin .
“ When this arrived in my inbox , I think I said out loud , ‘ Holeee shit ! ‘ ” he recalled .
“ Jon Vermilyea took Venom , a Spider - Man villain that represented the gritted - teeth excesses of ’90s superhero comics , and made him truly shocking .
I feel like I could get lost in his drips , folds and bumps .
I would love to have a black - light poster of this . ”
Detective Comics No. 284 , covered by Ben Newman
“ Ben was an artist I was unfamiliar with when he submitted this gem a few months ago , ” Goodin said .
“ Batman comics from this era were pretty flat .
But Ben took that and ran with it , creating something very graphic and exciting .
I love Robin ’s hair .
The cover looks like it was painted on acoustic ceiling tiles . ”
While evaluating submissions , Goodin , a full - time storyboard artist and part - time slave to comics , looks for some of the same qualities as conventional art critics : composition , line quality , color , artistic ability .
“ A cover does n’t have to have all of those things going for it , ” he said , “ but the more the better . ”
Strange Worlds No. 4 , covered by Mark Todd
“ Mark Todd was doing covers like this a few years before the blog and was one of the inspirations to start [ Covered ] , ” Goodin said .
“ He ’s done probably 50 covers similar to this one .
He ’s someone who uses the original as a jumping - off point to go somewhere very , very different .
This one won me over with the bag of fuzzy balls .
What does ‘ fragments ’ mean ?
Why is that there ?
I love it . ”
Batman No. 197 , covered by Richard Sala
Goodin does n’t follow comics so much as he follows comics artists , including influences like Jack Kirby , Robert Crumb , Alex Toth , Dan Clowes and Jacques Tardi .
Contributors to Goodin ’s homage factory include established but still up - and - coming pros like Jeff Lemire , Dash Shaw , Johnny Ryan and Richard Sala .
“ This was a very pleasant surprise , ” Goodin said .
“ Someone e-mailed me a small file of this , and told me that a friend had commissioned Richard Sala to do it .
I asked Richard if I could run it on the blog .
He not only said yes , but sent me a better scan .
I think that this painting has the creepy feel of the ’ 40s Batman comics . ”
Jonah Hex No. 16 , covered by M. Jason Robards
“ I really look at this one as a triumph of cartooning over more representational drawing in mainstream comics , ” Goodin said .
“ In Rich Buckler ’s version , all of the elements are there and the viewer immediately knows what ’s happening , but in Jason ’s version , the viewer really gets in the heads of the participants .
I love how the hangmen are looking from under the brim of their hats and Jonah Hex ’s crazed look .
I ’ve never bought a Jonah Hex comic , but I would if they looked like this . ”
Most Covered contributors are on the path to becoming full - time comic artists , Goodin said .
“ Because of comics ’ economics , sadly very few would be considered pro , although there are quite a few that are established , ” he added .
“ By established , I mean that they have a certain amount of popularity in the field , but may not be making a living doing it . ”
Avengers No. 221 , covered by Jon Adams
“ Avengers 221 has become a bit of a standard for Covered , ” Goodin said .
“ It started as a fluke when two different artists sent me the same cover within a week of each other .
A third artist quickly added his spin to it and finally Jon Adams created a fourth one seen here — a cover that looks like it was designed by Marvel ’s lawyers with a lot of tasty corporatespeak . ”
To keep the mix of contributors fresh , Goodin lets months go by before he ’ll publish covers by repeat artists .
Superman ’s Pal : Jimmy Olsen No. 98 , covered by Paul Karasik
Finding the rare revision , from a noob or a pro , that stretches the envelope is Goodin ’s ultimate goal .
“ Paul Karasik ’s Jimmy Olsen cover , more than any others , showed me a new way of looking at the original , ” Goodin said .
“ By separating five distinct levels from Curt Swan ’s original , one can see how Swan used the various overlapping levels of foreground , middle grounds and background to create his illusion of depth .
“ However , since Swan is so strict with those levels , it appears like a diorama with cardboard cut -outs standing in a museum exhibition .
He both creates depth and flatness simultaneously .
It ’s very strange . ”
2001 : A Space Odyssey No. 6 , covered by Michael DeForge
“ Michael DeForge ’s cover is as trippy and weird as getting Fantastic Four creator Jack Kirby to do a comic based on Stanley Kubrick ’s 2001 , which this cover is taken from , ” Goodin said .
Goodin said he ’s always on the hunt for contributions from graphic designers , illustrators , animators , photographers and other people “ outside of the field of comics . ”
“ The more well - executed surprises , the better , ” he said .
Captain America No. 2 , covered by Danny Hellman
“ Something that I really enjoy about Danny Hellman ’s Captain America cover is how thuggish and menacing Cap looks , ” Good said .
“ Perhaps this version more accurately reflects our times . ”

Three men have been found guilty by a court in Tanzania for murdering an albino boy , in a ruling that campaigners hope will help protect the minority group from being slaughtered for their body parts .
The landmark verdict is the first time anyone has been convicted of killing an albino despite more than 50 murders in the past three years .
Albinos – who suffer from a genetic defect that alters their skin and hair pigmentation – have been targeted by modern day witch doctors in East Africa who believe their body parts add potency to black magic rituals .
A string of brutal attacks in which members of the minority group have been literally hacked to pieces , with children as young as five being killed , has provoked angry criticism of the government .
Tanzania , while an extremely poor country , has long enjoyed relative stability and is renowned for its spectacular national parks and Indian Ocean coastline .

The President Jakaya Kikwete has spoken out against the killers and banned witch doctors earlier this year , while police have arrested scores of suspects but Tanzania 's justice system is notoriously slow and yesterday 's conviction was the first of its kind .
The court in the north - western Shinyanga district , close to the shore of Lake Victoria , sentenced the three men to death by hanging for the murder in December last year of 14 - year - old Matatizo Dunia .
One of the accused was found with both of the boy 's legs when he was arrested .
There are an estimated 17,000 albinos in Tanzania and some researchers believe the genetic defect may have originated in East Africa .
Today many albinos in the region suffer intense prejudice and are routinely referred to as " zerus " or invisibles .
The skin , hair , eyes and limbs of albinos can command thousands of dollars on the black magic market in Tanzania .
These sums – often paid by educated , ambitious city dwellers who travel to rural witch doctors for help with business , family or sexual problems – have been sufficient for freelance killers to hunt the pale - skinned minority .
At least 53 murders have been recorded since September 2007 with the most recent killing taking place last month .
While most of the attacks have taken place in the Shinyanga and Mwanza areas in the north - west , albinos are at risk all over the country and body parts have turned up in neighbouring Burundi , the Democratic Republic of Congo and Kenya .
The Tanzanian Albino Society ( TAS ) had been warning for years of the growing threat to their community but found initially that there was little official interest in the killings .
The UK - based agency , Action on Disability and Development ( ADD ) , which supports TAS , said it " applauds the efforts of the Tanzanian authorities to bring the perpetrators to justice " but called on the courts to commute the death sentences to life imprisonment on appeal .
Since last year , authorities in Tanzania , stung by an international outcry , have launched a public awareness campaign to attack the superstitious beliefs and last year the President appointed the country 's first albino MP , the 48 - year - old Al - Shymaa Kway - Geer .
There have been 90 arrests so far in the huge East African nation , including four police officers , which has confirmed fears in some quarters that there is official involvement in some of the killings .
There are another 15 cases going through the courts in the country .
A local BBC journalist , Vicky Ntetema , was last year forced to flee Tanzania after receiving a string of death threats following an undercover investigation into the trade in body parts .
A Canadian businessman and campaigner , Peter Ash , himself albino , said authorities must pursue the killers in every case .
" This is one conviction .
There are 52 other families still awaiting justice , " he said .
Speaking before the trial on a tour of the country , the campaigner who set up the Under the Same Sun organisation , highlighted the case of a five - year - old girl named Mariam .
She was attacked by a group of men in the city of Mwanza .
" One of them slit her throat , drained her blood into a saucepan and drank it in the presence of her two siblings , " he said .
The men then chopped off her limbs and ran off .
" Mariam did not have the benefit of being unconscious first , " he added .
" She was killed , like an animal , by grown men who did this deliberately while her siblings watched . "
Hello Kitty : The Funny , The Weird , And The Horrifying
Thanks to the marketing skills of Japanese company Sanrio , Hello Kitty ’s cute - cat character has been going strong for 35 years and has become an internationally - recognized brand .
One of the most diverse and unpredictable places in the entire universe , the world of Hello Kitty encompasses a vast collection of strange products that dazzle the mind and serve as material for an extensive list of noteworthy weirdness .
Since there are thousands of Hello Kitty products in just about every category imaginable , it ’s difficult to find the weirdest of the weird .
Furthermore , many Hello Kitty pictures floating around the Internet are actually photoshopped fakes , so it takes some time to figure out what ’s real and what ’s not .
Still , I managed to scrape together this list of examples that appear to be legitimate products .
So , hold on to your seats and get ready to be entertained , disturbed , and maybe even sexually abused by one of the world ’s most famous felines !
Guns .
Did you think Hello Kitty was too cute for violence ?
Think again , because with a little effort you could be the proud owner of an assault rifle just like this one .
Anti-virus programs .
Looks like the Hello Kitty brand has been exploited to market someone ’s anti-virus program .
Personally , I would n’t trust my computer ’s health and well - being with something like this .
Condoms .
After researching and writing an article about weird Asian condoms , I ca n’t believe I missed this one .
I mean , it ’s so natural to expect Hello Kitty on a condom package , right ?
Condom holders .
Buy yourself one of those Hello Kitty condoms , and you ’ll probably have to spring for one of these lovely condom holders as well .

Want to hit the open road and travel across the country in the comfort of your own RV , but not leave your loving Hello Kitty behind ?
Well now you do n’t have to with your own Hello Kitty RV !
Tooth caps .
Any votes for this precious little innovation of orthodontics ?
Why yes thank you , I ’d simply love to have Hello Kitty ’s face implanted permanently in my mouth !

I am not making this up .
Even if you ’re a Hello Kitty fan , why would this be appealing ?
On the other hand , if you do n’t care too much for her , the whole experience of relieving yourself could be very gratifying .
Toilet seats .
Girls , please do n’t feel left out after seeing that last product .
To guarantee your complete urination experience , Hello Kitty also adorns toilet seats .
Electronic toilet paper dispensers .
Here ’s yet another one for the bathroom .
Talk about an invasion of privacy .
Is there nowhere Hello Kitty wo n’t go ?
( For those of you who are wondering , yes , Hello Kitty toilet paper is also available . )
Sausage links .
This is just bizarre .
Who really wants to see that dancing around on their meat tubes ?
Jets .
Taiwanese Eva Air has a Hello Kitty airplane that flies between Taiwan and Japan .
The interior decoration is Hello Kitty - themed , of course .
Contacts .
This is similar to those creepy cat - eye contacts people wear during the Halloween season .
Although these do n’t grab your attention as quickly , once you realize what ’s going on , it ’s pretty strange .
Wedding dresses .
You ’ve got to have a serious crush on Hello Kitty to get married in one of these .
What do you think , guys ?
Sexy , or maybe not so much ?
Fake fingernails .
Put these on and spread the Hello Kitty love to everyone around you .
It ’s like the famous Midas touch , except nothing turns into gold .
Instead , people just stare at you with undisguised perplexity .
Bongs .
If I ’m reading the right sources , this is apparently a Hello Kitty coin bank that has been modified for smoking pot .
As far as I know , it ’s not technically a real product , but hey , it ’s pretty hilarious !
Tampons and pads .
Is there a “ bodily fluids ” theme going on here , or am I just crazy ?
Boldly going where few cartoon characters dare to go , Hello Kitty .
Douches .
Someone please tell me this is a fake , or just go ahead and kill me right now .
I have no idea why something like Hello Kitty should ever be associated with douches .
Vibrators .
Let ’s not get into the details here , but you really have to be in love with Hello Kitty to want this one .
Also available in black , red , and lavender .
Floggers .
Okay , maybe the vibrators can be tolerated .
But floggers ?
Please excuse me for a moment while I stare in utter horror at my computer screen .
I think I ’ve finally reached a point where words no longer serve any purpose whatsoever .

Trials for the experimental H1N1 Swine flu vaccine commence Tuesday , September 15th in Thornton , Colorado .
Novartis , a bio- pharmaceutical company that manufactures the vaccine , is recommending that children participating in the trial receive two doses of an experimental vaccine which contain ingredients found in spermicides , cleaners , and cosmetics along with thimerosal and squalene ( MF59 ) .
Everyone should have a sense of concern as the only safety checks for these children are a few blood draws and follow - up phone calls .
No neurological testing .
No kidding .
Official opinions from federal agencies , such as the CDC , insist that the new vaccine will be safe and effective .
Experts say we can trust the new H1N1 experimental vaccine because the technology used to create the vaccine is time tested .
Experts argue that the only variable changing from the ‘ normal ’ flu vaccine and the H1N1 experimental vaccine is the novel A / H1N1 antigen .
In other words , the same vaccine ‘ technology ’ is used but with the new virus .
However , this is the furthest thing from the actual TRUTH .
As will be demonstrated , the following information was obtained through enrolling a family member into the study to gain an understanding as to what the ingredients would be .
After finding out the the information I am about to share , enrollment in this trial has been canceled .
SETTING THE STAGE ON SAFETY AND SQUALENE ( MF59 )
I met with the research coordinator for the study along with Dr. Melamed , an immunologist conducting the study .
Dr. Melamed altruistically shared his knowledge answering questions concerning immunology and the technology behind the vaccine while remaining evasive on questions of what was in the vaccine and legal ramifications if harm was done .
Dr. Melamed reassured me several times that the experimental H1N1 vaccine was created just like past vaccines and that the technology was well established .
Requests for package inserts for the ingredients of the experimental H1N1 vaccine were denied on the grounds that this was a study and that information is privileged .
However , we can still piece together some of the ingredients based upon the parental consent form .
“ MF59 is an adjuvant which is used in influenza vaccines licensed for the adults and / or elderly in many countries worldwide , but it is not contained in any vaccines currently approved in the United States . ” ( page 2 )
Is n’t it interesting that the study states it is licensed for adults and elderly ?
This study is designed for children between the ages of 3 and 8 and they plan on shooting up newborns and pregnant women with this stuff ?
Buyer beware .
Here is what the World Association for Vaccine Education had to say about Squalene ( MF59 ) :
Squalene : C30H50 an Adjuvant
Too dangerous for human use , Squalene is not licensed for use in the United States .
Ã‚Â
Oil adjuvants like squalene have been ordinarily used to inflict diseases in animals Ã¢â‚¬ ” for experimentation and study .
Ã‚Â According to anthrax vaccine expert Gary Matsumoto and other reliable sources , the US military used an unlicensed , experimental anthrax vaccination laced with squalene , with disastrous consequences , including Gulf War Sydrome .

Ã‚Â Vaccine A ; The Covert Government Experiment That ’s Killing Our Soldiers Ã¢â‚¬ ” and Why GI ’s Are Only the First Victims .

Present in these vaccines :
Anthrax ( experimental , used on military personnel )
Dr. Sherri Tenpenny also elaborates on the deleterious effects of the Squalene Adjuvant in a 2006 article entitled , “ FLU SHOTS AND THE NEW ADJUVANTS : BEWARE ! ” and can be found in its entirety here .
An excerpt from Dr. Tenpenny ’s article can give a better appreciation and understanding of what squalene is capable of in the body …
“ On first blush , squalene seems like a good choice for an adjuvant .
Manufactured naturally in the liver , squalene is a precursor for cholesterol .
In addition , squalene can be purchased at health food stores in its more commonly known form , Ã¢â‚ ¬Å “ shark liver oil .
Ã¢â‚ ¬Â However , ingested squalene has a completely different effect on the body than injected squalene .
When molecules of squalene enter the body through an injection , even at concentrations as small as 10 to 20 parts per billion , it can lead to self - destructive immune responses , such as autoimmune arthritis and lupus .
Several mechanisms have been proposed to explain this reaction .
Metabolically , squalene stimulates an immune response excessively and nonspecifically .
More than two dozen peer - reviewed scientific papers from ten different laboratories throughout the U.S. , Europe , Asia , and Australia have been published documenting the development of autoimmune disease in animals subjected to squalene - based adjuvants .
A convincing proposal for why this occurs includes the concept of “ molecular mimicry ” Â in which an antibody created against the squalene in MF59 can cross react with the body ’s squalene on the surface of human cells .
The destruction of the body ’s own squalene can lead to debilitating autoimmune and central nervous system diseases . “
“ Carcinogenicity , we ( Dr. Deborah Novicki of Novartis , another pharmaceutical company ) have done no testing for the carcinogenicity of MF59 adjuvant or any of our preventive vaccines .
We have n’t done it and we do n’t plan to . ”
This information is found on a workshop on adjuvants and adjuvanted preventative and therapeutic vaccines hosted by the FDA .
This gem of a quote is on page 391 .
STRANGE BEDFELLOWS : THIMEROSAL AND SPERMICIDES
Further down we see that , while not mentioned explicitly as ingredients , one can deduce they are in the vaccine via an implied allergic reaction .
“ If your child has had an allergic reaction in the past to eggs , egg products , neomycin or polymyxin ( antibiotics ) , sodium ethylmercurothiosalicylate or thimerosal ( compounds containing mercury that are frequently used as preservatives in vaccines ) , beta propriolactone ( substance that inactivates a virus ) , or nonoxynol 9 ( substance commonly used in cleaners , cosmetics , and spermicides ) , you must tell the medical staff … ” ( pg 8 ) ( emphasis mine )
Thimerosal has been thoroughly exposed as a neurological toxin largely in part and much gratitude to Lyn Redwood who obtained the meeting minutes from a secret meeting between government officials and pharmaceutical companies discussing the effects of the mercury additive .
The document is called the Simpsonwood document and details exclusively the neurological harm thimerosal causes in children .
Dr. Russell Blaylock has a commentary on the document here or read the meeting minutes yourself here .
“ the number of dose related relationships [ between mercury and autism ] are linear and statistically significant .
You can play with this all you want .
They are linear .
They are statistically significant . ”
Dr. William Weil , American Academy of Pediatrics .
Simpsonwood , GA , June 7 , 2000
“ the issue is that it is impossible , unethical to leave kids unimmunized , so you will never , ever resolve that issue [ regarding the impact of mercury ] . ”
Dr. Robert Chen , Chief of Vaccine Safety and Development , Centers For Disease Control , Simpsonwood , GA , June 7 , 2000
“ Forgive this personal comment , but I got called out at eight o’clock for an emergency call and my daughter - in - law delivered a son by c-section .
Our first male in the line of the next generation and I do not want that grandson to get a Thimerosal containing vaccine until we know better what is going on .
It will probably take a long time .
In the meantime , and I know there are probably implications for this internationally , but in the meanwhile I think I want that grandson to only be given Thimerosal - free vaccines . ”
Dr. Robert Johnson , Immunologist , University of Colorado , Simpsonwood , GA , June 7 , 2000
“ But there is now the point at which the research results have to be handled , and even if this committee decides that there is no association and that information gets out , the work has been done and through the freedom of information that will be taken by others and will be used in other ways beyond the control of this group .
And I am very concerned about that as I suspect that it is already too late to do anything regardless of any professional body and what they say .
My mandate as I sit here in this group is to make sure at the end of the day that 100,000,000 are immunized with DTP , Hepatitis B and if possible Hib , this year , next year and for many years to come , and that will have to be with thimerosal containing vaccines unless a miracle occurs and an alternative is found quickly and is tried and found to be safe . ”
Dr. John Clements , World Health Organization , Simpsonwood , GA , June 7 , 2000
One can only wonder the harmful effects nonoxynol 9 could bring .
I could find no past flu vaccine that contained this ingredient nor study showing it is safe to inject into humans .
At this point , it must be said .
According to the CDC ’s vaccine schedule , children now receive 36 vaccines prior to going into kindergarten .
This fall season will add 4 additional vaccines to this total for a grand total of 40 !?
And we ’re not even getting warmed up …
POSSIBLE RISKS AND SIDE EFFECTS
By far the most entertaining part of the meeting with Dr. Melamed is when my eyes bugged out on page 6 and 7 of the study .
It was explained to me that the side effects I am about to list off are side effects for all vaccines … and that I had nothing to worry about because this vaccine , this vaccine as you recall was made with ‘ established technology ’ .
If that is the case , it is the cause for even MORE concern !!!!
“ Other side effects that have been reported in clinical studies with other influenza vaccines or have been reported by people who received influenza vaccines may include : [ VacTRUTH Editor ’s Note : Potential Flu Symptoms Highlighted in RED ]
Reactions at the site of injection :
bruising
itchiness
rash
warmth
lump or irritation at the site where the vaccine was given
sharp pain in or along nerves or tingling of pins and needles ( paresthesia )
pain limiting movement of the limb where the vaccine was given
infection
muscle ache
Other general reactions :
hot flashes or flushing
chills or shivering
dizziness
generalized weakness
fainting shortly after vaccination
nausea
vomiting
diarrhea
loss of appetite
abdominal pain
back pain
lymph node enlargement
temporary decrease in the number of blood platelets , which may increase the risk of bleeding
bleeding
decrease in red blood cells , or anemia , which may make you feel tired .
high blood pressure ( hypertension )
shortness of breath
wheezing
chest tightness
chest pain
cough
sore throat
runny nose
“ pins and needles ” in the skin
sweating
skin disorders related to allergic reaction ( which can lead to rash and skin loss )
inflammation of blood vessels ( including inflammation of blood vessels that may cause short - term effect on kidneys )
confusion
headaches similar to those described as migraine
seizures associated with fever
spinal cord or brain inflammation ( encephalomyelitis )
paralysis
muscle weakness
infection
life - threatening and / or debilitating disorders of the nervous system “
On IMMUNoE ’s website , on page three of this flier , it states :
“ Q : Could the new H1N1 vaccine cause a person to get the flu ?
A : Contrary to popular belief , it is not possible to get flu from a flu vaccine .
This is true for the seasonal flu vaccine , as well as the investigational ( sic ) H1N1 vaccine . ”
Are the vaccines the same or not the same ?
Of course , Dr. Melamed at this point tells me about how people with weakened or no immune system can actually get the disease from a vaccine .
I asked what measures were being used to understand what the child ’s immune response would be ( or even if they had an immune response to indicate it was working PRIOR to the vaccine ) and Dr. Melamed said , ‘ none ’ .
If they do n’t measure before and after , how will they know ?
“ These other general conditions have occurred in people who received influenza vaccines :
autoimmune disorders ( these are disorders in which the body ’s tissue are attacked by its own immune system and include liver injury or nerve injury )
arthritis ( joint pain ) ” ( pg 8 )
DR ANDREW MOULDEN AND NEUROLOGICAL TESTING
Being a concerned parent one at this point would probably want to know how neurological damage is measured to know if it has occurred in their child .
To my surprise , NO NEUROLOGICAL MEASUREMENTS are taken !!!
Neurological damage can clearly be seen in past flu vaccines as was the case in the 1975 - 76 swine flu vaccine .
Dr. Andrew Moulden gives laypersons clinical skills to detect neurological damage occurring after a child or adult is vaccinated .
I highly recommend his DVD – Tolerance Lost that is found on his Brainguard website or reading several articles posted exclusively on VacTRUTH which will give you these skills .
They are respectively entitled , “ Dr. Andrew Moulden ( Interview ) : What You Were Never Told About Vaccines ” and “ Vaccinations are causing impaired blood flow ( Ischemia ) , Chronic Illness , Disease and Death for us all “ .
The second article has photographs showing you precisely what is occurring .
In a separate interview with Dr. Moulden , he succinctly states that if neurological measures are never taken , the industry can say that vaccines are safe .
The only measurements taken will be a brief physical exam , measurement of vital signs and body temperature , blood samples to check for immune response , reviewing diaries with staff , and follow up phone calls .
( pg4 ) Monitoring for safety is occurring for 13 months .
How can , then , the vaccines be declared for public use with any certainty of safety in less than 2 months ?
“ It is also of the understanding that eight investigational ( sic ) vaccine formulations with different amounts of A / H1N1 antigens and with or without adjuvant will be tested for this study . ” ( pg 2 )
OVERVIEW
Let us recap .
1 . The vaccine contains squalene ( MF59 ) which has not been tested for causing cancer .
2 . The vaccine contains thimerosal , a known culprit in causing autism and neurological deficits .
3 . The vaccine curiously contains nonoxynol - 9 used in spermicides .
4 . The vaccine will likely cause ( and spread ) the flu .
5 . No neurological testing will be done to ensure the vaccine is safe from harmful neurological side effects .
6 . Monitoring for safety will last 13 months , well beyond the flu season .
As to my knowledge , this information is the first of its kind validating the ingredients and the intent to use them on the population .
Buyer beware of this vaccine as we are likely to see an onslaught of damaged men , women , and children if there are forced vaccines .
The ‘ new ’ experimental vaccine is certainly unlike any other that we , as Americans , have been exposed to in the past .

From Conservapedia
Family Guy is an animated television program created by Seth MacFarlane and shown on the Fox television network , although it also has slots on TBS and Cartoon Network 's [ adult swim ] .
It documents the life of " the Griffins , " a fictional family who live in Quahog , Rhode Island .
The show , like The Simpsons and other cartoon shows on television , explores — from an extremely liberal angle — cultural and political themes that are important in the world today , as well as taking humorous approaches to past and present television shows .
[ 1]
It takes an unfavorable view of creationists , focusing instead on the theory of evolution .
[ 2 ]
Family
Guy is known for its constant use of rude and profane speech , violent and crude humor , and liberal deceit .
In that vein , the show has made numerous off - color jokes about teen pregnancy , bestiality , abortion , pedophilia , school shootings , the Holocaust , physical handicap , September 11th , suicide and domestic violence , among other topics .
Currently there are about 300 episodes in 16 seasons .
One notorious episode entitled When You Wish Upon a Weinstein , was banned from Fox for anti-Semitism . [ 3 ]
Several years later , another episode Partial Terms of Endearment was banned from Fox for encouraging abortions .
Yet another episode likened McCain - Palin supporters to Nazis . [ 4 ]
The show frequently uses jokes referencing Hitler and the Nazis .
Similarly , another episode involving Brian 's gay cousin Jasper and the legalization of gay marriage had a " joke " involving the Elizabeth Smart kidnapping case , where it openly mocked the fact that she was at the time of the episode deeply traumatized from her captors repeatedly raping her .
Another episode introduced a girl with Down Syndrome .
During a conversation , she remarked that her mother was the governor of Alaska .
Another episode featured a repeated catchphrase " Laura Bush Killed A Guy ! " [ 5 ]
This was a misleading statement , mocking a tragic car accident which occurred when she was 17 years old .
Laura Welch , as she was known then , ran a stop sign and crashed into another car , killing its only occupant , 17 - year - old Michael Douglas . [ 6 ]
Aside from the anti-Conservative and anti-Religious agenda being pushed , the show also is notorious for depicting an extremely unflattering ( and at many times very inaccurate ) image of the South , such as claiming they were still bitter about the Confederate States of America having lost the Civil War , depicting them as being way behind in terms of technology and culture by a century to the extent of still having one - room schoolhouses ( despite there not being any one - room schoolhouses for a little over half a century anywhere in America , let alone the South ) , everyone being outsmarted by a pig , having their personal standards being depicted as so low they viewed the character Meg Griffin as a goddess , being depicted as white - supremacists to the extent of falsely equating Klan activity being at its peak in Mississippi during the 1960s instead of Indiana during the 1920s or having blonde twin girls singing white power songs when the twins were actually from California , and also implying that one of the states , North Carolina , was 48th in Education ( when , at the time the episode aired , North Carolina had actually doubled in rank , being at 24th place ) .
On the other hand , the show has occasionally made fun of liberal politicians as well .
The episode Bill and Peter 's Bogus Journey portrays former president Bill Clinton as a hedonistic sex fiend and a drug user . [ 7 ]
The episode Underage Peter contains a brief joke about the alcoholism of Barack Obama 's daughters .
The episode The D in Apt. 23 makes fun of the snowflake mentality present in American millennials .
On that note , in one episode Quagmire criticizes Brian for his " textbook liberal agenda , " and then points out he does n't do anything to actually help .
Quagmire also points out Brian has no right to say religion is for idiots because Brian failed college twice , as well as Brian 's hypocrisy in saying homelessness is an important issue while doing nothing to help the homeless . [ 8 ]
Criticism
Family Guy and its creators have been savaged by media and fans for its lack of originality and , in some cases , outright plagiarism , particularly from the vastly more popular show , The Simpsons .
The basic model of the family - a fat , drunk , stupid , yet good - hearted husband with an attractive , yet nagging wife - is a direct copy of Homer and Marge Simpson .
The show has stolen numerous plot ideas from The Simpsons , including the wife developing a gambling addiction . [ 9 ]
The character of Stewie is a well - documented theft of the comic book character Jimmy Corrigan , the smartest kid on Earth . [ 10 ]
The Simpsons and South Park have openly mocked Family Guy for its lack of creativity and frequent derivative sequences .
One episode of South Park portrayed Family Guy as being written by manatees who would randomly select balls inscribed with a noun , verb and pop culture reference , thus creating all the jokes for the show .
The show has also been criticized for having declined in quality since its " uncancellation " for reasons including its constant recycling of jokes , its departure from the more smart , dialogue based humour of the first three seasons in favour of shock and gross - out humour and drastic changes in the characters , for example , Brian was originally portrayed as the voice of reason in the family with a dry sense of humour eventually became an alcoholic , promiscuous , preachy , atheist ( despite previously proclaiming belief in God in earlier episodes ) , marijuana smoking hypocrite who served the sole purpose of being a loud speaker for Seth MacFarlane 's political views .
He also promotes bestiality due to episodes frequently portraying him having sex with many different female humans and never other dogs .
Similarly , Peter Griffin 's characterization also spiraled down to him becoming downright abusive and callous , alongside that of his wife .
The son Chris now serves no purpose other than to promote excessive masturbation and negligence in school while being constantly preyed upon by an old paedophile named Herbert , and Stewie has been flanderised from a clever mastermind into an effeminate closeted - homosexual wimp .
Botox is an accepted treatment for the type of paralysis commonly associated with strokes .
It was used to treat muscle spasm years before it was adopted for cosmetic use .
However , patients usually show the best effects if they are treated soon after a stroke and such a dramatic improvement after so long is almost unheard of .
Google is the world 's leading internet search engine
Sony personal computers are now available with Google 's Chrome internet browser following a deal struck between the two technology giants this summer .
This is the first such deal that Google has signed with a PC maker .
Google said it plans to tie up further deals as it looks to promote the browser it launched last year .
Chrome lags well behind Microsoft 's market - leading Internet Explorer and Mozilla Foundation 's Firefox browsers in market share .
Internet Explorer is used by more than two - thirds of all internet users , while Chrome is used by less than 3 % , according to web firm Net Applications .
" User response to Google Chrome has been outstanding , and we 're continuing to explore ways to make Chrome accessible to even more people , " Google said .
Some Sony PCs are already running Chrome as a result of the deal .
Obama 's Speech to AFL -CIO
" Hello Cincinnati .
Hello Ohio .
I can't think of a better place to be on Labor Day than at America 's biggest Labor Day picnic - with the workers and families of the Cincinnati AFL - CIO .
First , give a big round of applause to Charlie .
Charlie reminds us that in these tough times , America 's working men and women are ready to roll up their sleeves and get back to work . "
" I want to salute your AFL - CIO local leaders : Executive Secretary - Treasurer Doug Sizemore , President Joe Zimmer and state President Joe Rugola .
And your outstanding national leaders : a man who we thank for devoting his life to working Americans - President John Sweeney .
And the man who will pick up the mantle of leadership - who we need to succeed because a strong labor movement is part of a strong economy - Secretary - Treasurer Rich Trumka .
Although Ohio's terrific Governor Ted Strickland could n't be here , we have Lieutenant Governor Lee Fisher , Secretary of State Jennifer Brunner , Attorney General Richard Cordray , Cincinnati Mayor Mark Mallory , and Hamilton County Commission President David Pepper .
We 're joined by members of Ohio 's congressional delegation : Congressman Steve Driehaus and my great friend - who is at the forefront of every fight for Ohio 's working men and women , including the battle for health insurance reform - Senator Sherrod Brown .
And I 'm proud to be here with a leader who is re-energizing the Department of Labor - and a daughter of union members - Secretary Hilda Solis .
And my director of recovery for auto communities and workers - Ed Montgomery .
Now , like a lot of Americans , you 're having some fun today .
Taking the day off .
Spending time with the kids .
Enjoying some good music and good food - some famous Cincinnati chili .
But today we also pause .
To remember .
To reflect .
To reaffirm .
We remember that the rights and benefits we enjoy today were not simply handed out to America 's working men and women .
They had to be won .
They had to be fought for , by men and women of courage and conviction , from the factory floors of the Industrial Revolution to the shopping aisles of today 's superstores .
They stood up and spoke out to demand a fair shake ; an honest day 's pay for an honest day 's work .
Many risked their lives .
Some gave their lives .
Some made it a cause of their lives - like Senator Ted Kennedy , who we remember today .
So let us never forget : much of what we take for granted - the 40 - hour work week , the minimum wage , health insurance , paid leave , pensions , Social Security , Medicare - they all bear the union label .
It was the American worker - union men and women - who returned from World War II to make our economy the envy of the world .
It was labor that helped build the largest middle class in history .
So even if you 're not a union member , every American owes something to America 's labor movement .
As we remember this history , let us reflect on its meaning in our own time .
Like so many Americans , you work hard and meet your responsibilities .
You play by the rules and pay your bills .
But in recent years , the American Dream seemed to slip away , because from Washington to Wall Street , too often a different culture prevailed .
Wealth was valued over work , selfishness over sacrifice , greed over responsibility , the right to organize undermined rather than strengthened .
That 's what we saw .
And while it may have worked out well for a few at the top , it sure did n't work out well for our country .
That culture - and the policies that flowed from it - undermined the middle class and helped create the greatest economic crisis of our time .
So today , on this Labor Day , we reaffirm our commitment .
To rebuild .
To live up to the legacy of those who came before us .
To combine the enduring values that have served us so well for so long - hard work and responsibility - with new ideas for a new century .
To ensure that our great middle class remains the backbone of our economy - not just a vanishing ideal we celebrate at picnics once a year as summer turns to fall .
That 's what we 've been working to do every day since I took office .
Now , some people have already forgotten how bad it was just seven months ago .
A financial system on the verge of collapse .
About 700,000 workers losing their jobs each month .
The worst recession of our lifetimes threatening to become another Great Depression .
That 's why we took bold , swift action - passing an unprecedented Recovery Act , and doing it without the usual Washington earmarks and pork - barrel spending .
And , Ohio , it 's working .
We 've given 95 percent of America 's working families a tax cut -4.5 million families in Ohio , including here in Cincinnati .
We 've cut taxes for small businesses , and made new loans to more than 1,000 small businesses in Ohio so they can grow and hire more workers .
We 've extended unemployment benefits for 12 million Americans , including Charlie and nearly 570,000 Ohio citizens .
Across America , we 've saved the jobs of tens of thousands of state and local workers - including teachers and first responders here in Ohio .
We 're rebuilding America 's infrastructure , including the improvements to I - 75 in Hamilton County - led by a local Cincinnati contractor - and more than 200 other highway projects across Ohio .
And we 're making an historic commitment to innovation - much of it still to come in the months and year ahead : doubling our capacity to generate renewable energy ; building a new smart grid to carry electricity from coast to coast ; laying down broadband lines and high - speed rail lines ; and providing the largest boost in basic research in history .
So our Recovery plan is working .
The financial system has been saved from collapse .
Home sales are up .
We 're seeing signs of life in the auto industry .
Business investment is starting to stabilize .
For the first time in 18 months , we 're seeing growth in manufacturing .
On Friday , we learned that the economy lost another 216,000 jobs in August .
And whenever Americans are losing jobs - especially so many - that 's simply unacceptable .
But for the second straight month , we lost fewer jobs than the month before and it was the fewest jobs lost in a year .
So make no mistake .
We 're moving in the right direction .
Ohio , we 're on the road to recovery .
But we 've still got a long way to go .
So we will not rest , we will not let up .
Not until workers looking for jobs can find them - good jobs that sustain families and sustain dreams .
Not until responsible mortgage - owners can stay in their homes .
Not until we have a full economic recovery and all Americans have their shot at the American Dream .
But we can't do that if we go back to that old economy - overleveraged banks , inflated profits and maxed - out credit cards .
An economy of bubbles and bursts , where your wages and incomes stagnate while corporate profits soar .
So even as we recover from the recession and work to cut the deficit in half , we have to build a new foundation for prosperity in America .
An America with a reformed financial regulation system that protects consumers and the entire financial system so we never have a crisis like this again .
An America where energy reform creates green jobs that can never be outsourced and that finally frees America from the grip of foreign oil .
An America that commits to education - because the countries that out - educate us today will out - compete us tomorrow and the best jobs will go to the best educated - whether they live in Cincinnati or Shanghai .
So we 've got to do a better job educating our sons and daughters .
An America that once again invests in the middle class , which is why I 've created our Task Force on Middle Class Working Families , led by Vice President Joe Biden , to make sure that our policies always benefit you - America 's workers .
And today we 're taking another step .
I 'm naming Ron Bloom to lead our efforts to revitalize the sector that helped build the middle class :
American manufacturing .
Ron has worked with steelworkers , service employees and management to create new jobs .
He 's helped guide my auto task force .
And as my new point person on manufacturing , he 'll help us craft the policies that will create the next generation of manufacturing jobs and ensure American competitiveness in the 21st century .
And , yes , we 're building an America where health insurance reform delivers more stability and security to every American - the many who have insurance today and the millions who do n't .
Now , I 'll have a lot more to say about this Wednesday night , and I do n't want to give it all away .
But let me just say this .
We 've been fighting for quality , affordable health care for every American for nearly a century - since Teddy Roosevelt .
The Congress and the country have been engaged in a vigorous debate for many months .
And debate is good , because we have to get this right .
But in every debate there comes a time to decide , a time to act .
And Ohio , that time is now .
We 've never been this close .
We 've never had such broad agreement on what needs to be done .
And because we 're so close to real reform , the special interests are doing what they always do - trying to scare the American people and preserve the status quo .
But I 've got a question for them :
What 's your answer ?
What 's your solution ?
The truth is , they do n't have one .
It 's do nothing .
And we know what that future looks like .
Insurance companies raking in the profits while discriminating against people because of pre-existing conditions and denying or dropping coverage when you get sick .
It means you 're never negotiating about higher wages , because you 're spending all your time just protecting the benefits you already have .
It means premiums continuing to skyrocket three times faster than your wages .
More families pushed into bankruptcy .
More businesses cutting more jobs .
More Americans losing their health insurance - 14,000 every day .
And it means more Americans dying every day just because they do n't have insurance .
But that 's not the future I see for America .
I see reform where we bring stability and security to folks who have insurance today .
Where you never again have to worry about going without coverage - if you lose your job , change your job or get sick .
Where there is a cap on your out - of - pocket expenses , so you do n't have to worry that a serious illness will break you and your family .
Where you never again have to worry that you or someone you love will be denied coverage because of a pre-existing condition .
I see reform where Americans and small businesses that are shut out of health insurance today will be able to purchase coverage at a price they can afford .
Where they 'll be able to shop and compare in a new health insurance exchange - a marketplace where competition and choice will continue to hold down cost and help deliver them a better deal .
And I continue to believe that a public option within the basket of insurance choices would help improve quality and bring down costs .
I see reform where we protect our senior citizens by closing the gaps in their Medicare prescription coverage that costs millions of older Americans thousands of dollars every year out of their own pockets ; reforms that will preserve Medicare and put it on a sounder financial footing by cutting waste and fraud and the more than one hundred billion dollars in unwarranted public subsidies to an already profitable insurance industry .
I want a health insurance system that works as well for the American people as it does for the insurance industry .
They should be free to make a profit .
But they also have to be fair .
They also have to be accountable .
Security and stability for folks who have health insurance .
Help for those who do n't - the coverage they need at a price they can afford .
Finally bringing costs under control .
That 's the reform we need .
That 's the reform we 're fighting for .
And that 's why it 's time to do what 's right for America 's working families .
To put aside the partisanship .
To come together as a nation .
To pass health insurance reform now - this year .
And few have fought harder or longer for health care and America 's workers than you - our brothers and sisters of organized labor .
And just as we know that we must adapt to all the changes and challenges of a global economy , we also know this : in good economic times and bad , labor is not part of the problem .
Labor is part of the solution .
That 's why Secretary Solis has made it a priority at the Labor Department to protect workers - your safety , your benefits , your right to organize and bargain collectively .
It 's why some of the first executive orders I issued overturned the previous administration 's attempts to stifle organized labor .
It 's why I support the Employee Free Choice Act - to level the playing field so it 's easier for employees who want a union to form a union .
Because when labor is strong , America is strong .
When we all stand together , we all rise together .
And that is why the first piece of legislation I signed into law was the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act - guaranteeing equal pay for equal work .
Lilly worked at an Alabama factory .
She did her job and did it well .
Then , after nearly two decades , she discovered that for years she was paid less than her male colleagues - for doing the very same work .
Over the years , she had lost hundreds of thousands of dollars in wages and in pension and Social Security benefits .
Lilly could have just moved on .
Instead , this Alabama grandmother made a decision - principle was at stake .
She stood up and spoke out for what was right - all the way to the Supreme Court , then Congress , and finally the White House , where I signed the law that bears her name .
That 's the lesson of this day - that some things are always worth fighting for .
Equal pay .
Fair wages .
Dignity in the workplace .
Justice on the job .
An economy that works for everyone , because in America there are no second - class citizens .
An economy where you can make a living and care for your families .
Where you leave your kids something better .
Where we live up to our fundamental ideals - those words put on paper some 200 years ago .
That we are all created equal ; that we all deserve a chance to pursue our happiness and achieve our goals .
That is the calling to which we are summoned this Labor Day .
That is the cause of my presidency .
And that is the commitment we must fulfill to preserve the American Dream for all of America 's working families .
God bless you .
And God bless the United States of America . "

Field trials of a new cotton are verifying previous lab and greenhouse studies indicating the crop could become a source of protein for millions of malnourished people in the world .
The cotton was engineered so that the toxic gossypol is reduced to tolerable levels in the high - protein seed but remain at higher levels in the rest of the plant to ward off pests and disease .
" The results look very promising . " said Dr. Keerti Rathore , the Texas AgriLife Research plant biotechnologist in whose lab the cotton was developed .
Gossypol has long been a block for cotton farmers trying to make cotton seed available for human or animal consumption .
Cotton fibers have been spun into fabric for more than 7,000 years , but generally only cattle have been able to eat the fuzzy seeds that are separated from the fiber .
Cattle can tolerate the gossypol because it is gradually digested through their unique four - part stomach .
Dr. Keerti Rathore and lab assistant LeeAnn Campbell harvest cotton from the first field trial of a variety that has gossypol levels low enough for human consumption .
Low - gossypol cotton could ultimately make available 44 million metric tons of the high - protein seed every year to help feed malnourished people worldwide .
( Photo Credit : ( Texas AgriLife Research photo by Kathleen Phillips ) )
But less than three years ago , Rathore 's paper in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences announced that cotton plants had been successfully altered in the lab to " silence " gossypol in the seed .
Five generations of cotton plants produced in greenhouses and the small test plot in the field this year are showing similar findings , Rathore said , though the results have not yet been published in scholarly journals .
" We have analyzed the plant leaves , flower organs and seeds , " Rathore said of the first plant grown under normal farm conditions .
" The levels of gossypol and related defense chemicals are similar to that of regular cotton plants in the buds , leaves and flowers .
But the seed is still showing the ultra - low levels of gossypol . "
Rathore and his team used a scientific method called RNAi , a process also being used to explore cancer and HIV cures .
This technology , discovered by Nobel laureates Andrew Z. Fire and Craig C. Mello , can silence specific genes .
That enabled the team to target the gossypol gene in the cottonseed but let the gene express itself in the rest of the plant .
The " beauty of this project , " Rathore said , is that the high - protein seed could be a new food source - especially in developing countries .
As reported in his original paper , the cottonseed from these plants meet World Health Organization and U.S. Food and Drug Administration standards for food consumption , potentially making a new , high - protein food available to 500 million people a year .
First yields from a field study of cotton with ultra- low levels of gossypol indicated that researchers are well on the way to developing a new protein source for human consumption .
The test plot near College Station , Texas is being analyzed by developer Dr. Keerti Rathore , Texas AgriLife Research plant biotechnologist .

Rathore noted that for every pound of cotton fiber , the plant produces about 1.6 pounds of seed .
The annual world cottonseed production equals about 44 million metric tons , and studies have shown the seed to be about 22 percent protein .
He said kernels from the safe seed could be ground into a flour - like powder and used as a protein additive in food preparations or perhaps roasted and seasoned as a nutritious snack .
Cotton Inc. , which helps fund the research , is enthusiastic about the results .
" The entire cotton industry has a vested interest in expanding the uses of the cotton plant , " said J. Berrye Worsham , Cotton Inc. president and CEO .
" The success Dr. Rathore and his team have had with the field trial gets us one step closer to cotton being viewed as a fiber and a food source for future generations . "
Previous attempts to breed cotton varieties without gossypol were not commercially successful because the toxin was removed from the seed as well as the rest of the plant .
That left the plants vulnerable to insects and disease – a risk and a cost that farmers were n't willing to accept .
A way to extract gossypol out of the oil was developed years ago , Rathore noted , but at a cost .
Plus , the meal left after the oil was extracted still contained the toxin so could not be consumed by humans , or as feed for pigs , chickens or turkeys .
Rathore plans to continue field trial studies to assure the stability of the gossypol - free cotton variety , and he has additional lines that he expects have even lower levels of the substance .
But , he adds , the greatest obstacle for seeing the variety grown in fields and ultimately feeding the world 's hungry may be legalities .
Because the variety is " genetically modified , " the scientist and AgriLife Research will have to negotiate with others who hold patent rights to some of the basic technologies used to develop this " ultra - low seed - gossypol " cotton .
He will also have to seek approval through the U.S. Department of Agriculture , U.S. Food and Drug Administration and perhaps other agencies to make it commercially available as seed to farmers .
That process could take years , he said .
A boll of cotton with the ultra - low gossypol levels is maturing in the first field trial .
The low - gossypol cotton was developed by Dr. Keerti Rathore as a new protein source for human consumption .

A couple of months ago I realised that I got a bit bored with web development and decided to try something new .
Lots of interesting stuff seemed to happen in the mobile development sector , mainly driven by the huge success of Apple ’s iPhone platform .
At a London hackspace meetup I finally got to play with one of the first Android phones , a G1 ( also known as HTC Dream ) and was impressed : it certainly lacked the elegance and polish of an Apple product , but the platform looked promising .
I decided to get started on Android mainly for two reasons : firstly , it ’s an open platform built on open source technology which makes it a lot easier to hack on .
This applies to the application distribution channel ( Android Market ) as well , where applications do n’t need to be approved before they can be installed .
In fact it ’s even possible to bypass the Market completely and install apps directly from a website .
Compare that to Apple ’s mysterious and not very transparent approval “ policies ” .
Secondly , as the platform is still quite young there ’s a potential for early adopters to build interesting things as the market is not completely saturated .
What follows is a mini-review , highlighting the good & bad points from my perspective .
The bad stuff
Usability
While Android ’s inner workings might be well engineered , Google sucks at user experience design .
For example , in the Android Market you can browse through a list of featured applications by sliding your finger over the display .
The name of the focused application is located under the row of icons , exactly where you ’re finger is normally placed to scroll through the list , making it very cumbersome to use .
Why not just put it above the icons so you can read it while you browse ?
The Android Market , the main place to install new software and therefore quite an important application is pretty crap .
Apps are listed in completely useless or arbitrary categories ( Health , Lifestyle , Productivity ) and do n’t provide any screen shots .
The text - based search interface is rudimentary ( no spelling suggestion , only exact queries will match ) , quite embarrassing for a company like Google which should know how to implement good search functionality .
The most recent version of the SDK ( 1.6 , still in developer beta ) addresses at least some of these issues : Android Market Updates in 1.6 .
Performance
Android has its own custom JVM implementation called Dalvik , which is heavily optimised for mobile devices ( low memory footprint , process isolation ) .
Unfortunately it does n’t support JIT or AOT compilation at the moment ( although they have stated “ We do plan to include JIT and / or AOT compilation in a future release ” ) .
This might not be a problem for simple apps like TODO lists etc . but do n’t expect anything CPU intensive to run smoothly on this device .
I tried to port jsidplay ( a Java library which emulates SID , the sound chip used in the old Commodore 64 ) to Android and quickly gave up after listening to the first results , it was just too slow and produced choppy playback .
Similarly the JavaGB project ( open source Java Game Boy emulator ) abandoned the Android version because of the missing JIT compilation .
So in the meantime the only way to get reasonable performance out of Android is to go native ( C/C ++ ) using the Android NDK , which ultimately means trading ease of development for speed .
Building everything from source
I ’ve already mentioned that the whole platform being released as open source ( Apache Software License ) was one of the reasons why I picked Android over other systems .
So one of the first things I tried after getting my Google dev phone was to replace the pre-installed firmware with a new version entirely compiled from source , following the instructions ( “ Building For Dream ” ) .
It turns out that it ’s actually very difficult to produce a usable image which is comparable to the one shipped with the device , binary drivers need to be extracted from the phone and the build process itself is very complicated .
No Multitouch
By default Android does n’t support multitouch gestures .
Apparently there is support for it in the codebase but it got disabled on Apple ’s request ( legal / patent issues ? ) .
There are some unofficial firmwares floating around which re-enable it , but I have n’t actually tried them out .
Gdata api integration
While applications shipped with Android phones integrate well with Google ’s different services ( GMail , GCalendar ) the situation looks bad from a developer ’s perspective : the SDK does n’t contain Java APIs to access Google ’s services programmatically , you have to roll your own .
The good stuff
polyglot programming
Although Dalvik uses its own bytecode format and has no support for JIT yet , it still opens up a lot of possibilities for developing Android applications in languages other than Java .
I ’m planning to use Scala for my first Android project and a proof of concept looks promising so far .
JRuby project lead Charles Nutter is working on getting JRuby fully supported on Android ( project Ruboto ) and some people even tinker with Clojure , a modern implementation of Lisp on the JVM .
Not JVM based , but still interesting is the Android Scripting Environment ( ASE ) , a project aiming to make scripting languages available for application development .
At the moment it supports Python , Perl , Lua and BeanShell .
api / architecture design
Overall the API is reasonably well designed .
One part of it stands out : the Intent / Activity model .
The idea behind intents is to make some parts of applications callable from other programs , often to perform specific tasks .
The barcode scanner application ZXing is a good example .
Say you wanted to integrate some barcode reading functionality in your own application , instead of linking and bundling it with your code you can request the scan from an already installed application as follows :
Intent intent = new Intent ( " com.google.zxing.client.android.SCAN " ) ; intent .
putExtra ( " SCAN_MODE " , " QR_CODE_MODE " ) ; startActivityForResult ( intent , 0 ) ;
This will launch the barcode application in scan mode ( if not already running ) , and transfer control back to your handler method after the scan is completed :
public void onActivityResult ( int requestCode , int resultCode , Intent intent ) { if ( requestCode == 0 ) { if ( resultCode == RESULT_OK ) {
String contents = intent .
getStringExtra ( " SCAN_RESULT " ) ;
String format = intent .
getStringExtra ( " SCAN_RESULT_FORMAT " ) ; //
Handle successful scan } else if ( resultCode == RESULT_CANCELED ) { //
Handle cancel } } }
It ’s a move away from monolithic , isolated applications , and a big step ahead of the current iPhone programming model .
The Open Intents project aims to provide a registry for reusable intents which can be used by other applications .
Good tool support
The SDK ships with a lot of tools , my favourite is the Dalvik Debug Monitor Service ( DDMS ) , see screenshot below .
The powerful DDMS tool
It lets you monitor pretty much everything happening on a running device ( or emulator ) , CPU load , memory allocation , logging output etc .
Android projects are by default built using ant , but it ’s very easy to use Rake instead ( Andrake ) .
If you prefer developing in an IDE , there are plugins available for the most common ones ( Intellij IDEA , Eclipse , Netbeans ) .
Community
There is a growing hacker community around Android and Google now tries to encourage developers to contribute to the codebase .
CyanogenMod is an example of a custom firmware with an optimised kernel and various other enhancements .
I ’m hopeful that the open nature of Android itself motivates more developers to build a rich infrastructure of open source projects around the platform , similar to Linux .
At the moment most applications in the Android Market are available for free ( but not necessarily open source ) , although that might change as the user base grows .
Conclusion
With more Android phones arriving in the next few months there is a good chance that the platform will become the second player after Apple in the mobile market , but there are obviously quite a few rough edges which need sorting out .
The potential is clearly there .
[ digg - reddit - me ] I know that defending torture is difficult as well as unconscionable – but just because an editor will publish such trash does n’t necessary mean they are bad at their job .
However , if the evidence from this past weekend is any indication , it seems they are .
Pat Buchanan began his piece with a quote that has been famously and erroneously attributed to George Orwell :
Men sleep peacefully in their beds at night because rough men stand ready to do violence on their behalf .
Buchanan tries to use this quote to defend the Orwellian abuse of language that John Yoo and other Bush administration members used to legally justify the proposition that torture was n’t “ torture . ”
I have the feeling that Orwell would have appreciated the irony .
But more importantly , would n’t any editor take a moment to check if the quote was actually by Orwell ?
A Google search will quickly turn up the fact that it has been misattributed to him .
Maybe I ’m naive , but I would presume an editor – or someone – would take a moment to double check a citation .
Then of course Amanda Bowman in the Wall Street Journal explains the reason Americans watch 24 :
[ T ]he Obama Administration is going to pay a big political price for indulging the civil libertarians of their party .
The American television show 24 is in its 7th season because its portrayal of a life - and - death fight against terrorism in the face of political meddling appears to most Americans — and I would add Britons — both believable and justified .
[ my emphasis ]
I like 24 ; I still watch it – one of a slowly dwindling number of Americans who still does .
But anyone who calls it “ believable ” clearly is n’t familiar with the show .
When Jack Bauer wanted to stop a terrorist in a van , he jumped in front of the van .
Jack Bauer once died multiple times in a single episode – and was running around the next .
Jack Bauer extracts the truth from his prisoners with surgical precision – whether by shooting them in the leg , electrocuting them , or whatever other means are necessary .
( Bauer ’s techniques were so ineffective and so unrealistic that the U.S. military actually sent a team to talk to the show ’s producers a few years back . )
To get people to talk – some of them innocent – Bauer has threatened babies and kidnapped and mock executed children .
Every terrorist attack is financed and controlled by some convoluted plot involving nefarious American corporations seeking profits .
Bauer manages to never eat or go to the bathroom in the 24 - hour period covered by the show .
Perhaps most unrealistically , Bauer lives in a world where nuclear weapons have gone off several times on American soil and spectacular terrorists attacks are common – yet the Congress in Bauer ’s world insists on holding hearings that are more onerous than any held to this day by our Congresses , despite the respite from attacks in real life .
24 may be many things , but “ believable ” is n’t one of them .

Take in the sea breeze , the sand and surf shimmering in the sun , the palm trees swaying beside luxury high - rise hotels , shops and cafes .
The idyllic image helps explain why millions have come to Florida to play , and millions have come back to stay .
Drive a few blocks inland — past fading strip malls and fast - food joints — and a jolting new reality emerges .
The parking lot of a career counseling center along Oakland Park Boulevard is jammed .
There are n't enough counselors to advise hundreds of jobless people who come through the doors every day .
The recession has dealt a whopping blow to the fourth - most - populous state .
Unemployment is soaring .
Florida is second to California in foreclosures .
Last month came the most jaw - dropping announcement of all :
The state that made population growth the linchpin of its economy for more than 60 years lost a net 58,000 people this year , according to newly released estimates for April 1 .
" It 's the end of an era , " says Robert Lang , director of the Metropolitan Institute at Virginia Tech .
" Florida represents an entire postwar vision of the good life — palm trees , low cost and no taxes , just easy living .
They could turn it around , but in the short haul , it 's paradise lost . "
Florida is n't attracting retirees at nearly the rate it used to .
Nor is it drawing young people the way it once did because jobs have dried up .
The state 's twin economic engines — tourism and construction — are sputtering .
Now , Florida 's leaders are pushing hard to develop industries that will create high - paying jobs in fields such as alternative energy and bioscience .
" The time is long past when Florida 's economy can be based on waiting at the Welcome Center with a glass of free orange juice and a real estate map , " says state Sen.
Don Gaetz , a Republican .
" We have to do far better than that .
…
We are learning a great deal from the difficulties we 're undergoing . "
A place in the sun
The recession has had a measurable impact on the traditionally mobile USA by forcing more Americans to stay put because they can't sell their homes or find new jobs .
Its outsized effect on this dynamic Sun Belt state of 18.3 million is reshaping migration and settlement patterns across the nation .
It also could help redraw the electoral map once congressional seats are reapportioned after the 2010 Census .
Now that Florida 's population is shrinking , the state is unlikely to win another seat in Congress and some other states may be less likely to lose one , according to standard reapportionment formulas .
Florida has been a magnet for so long that when it stops drawing people , demographic ripples are felt elsewhere .
" It affects us because people are n't moving there from somewhere else , " Lang says .
" New Jersey stays bigger .
Pennsylvania stays bigger .
New York stays bigger . "
For more than a half - century , Florida had been the dream destination for millions of Americans .
Affordable housing in a fast - growing state , no state income tax , a sunny climate and the advent of air conditioning attracted a steady stream of retirees , sun-seekers and fortune hunters .
Now , not so much : • Growth has stalled .
For the first time since the end of World War II , when hundreds of thousands of military personnel stationed in Florida went home , the state lost population in the past year , according to the University of Florida 's Bureau of Economic and Business Research .
For the first time since Florida became a state in 1845 , more people are moving out of the state than in , according to Census numbers and moving company reports .
The number of migrants from the Northeast — traditionally Florida 's largest source of newcomers — has dropped almost in half since its peak five years ago as the state 's allure faded .
Florida , once the fifth cheapest state to live in , now is the 14th most expensive , according to Mark Wilson , president and CEO of the Florida Chamber of Commerce .
• Jobs are disappearing .
Unemployment jumped to 10.7 % in July from 6.3 % a year ago , well above the national rate of 9.4 % .
If thousands of working - age adults had n't abandoned the state , " our unemployment rate would 've been higher , " says John Hall , executive director of the Florida Center for Fiscal and Economic Policy , an independent research group .
" We 're a state in trouble , " Hall says .
• The housing market has collapsed .
Twelve percent of mortgages were in foreclosure during the second quarter of this year , the highest rate in the nation .
" Florida continues to establish itself as the worst state in the union for mortgage performance , " says Jay Brinkmann , chief economist at the Mortgage Bankers Association .
From Pensacola to Key West 850 miles away , the recession has rudely awakened a state that has flourished on a relentless influx of tourists , sun-seekers and retirees and the lower - paid service economy that supports them .
" Florida has been turned on its head , " says Brookings Institution demographer William Frey .
A statewide strategy Vastly different in geography , climate , culture and economic interests , Florida 's distinctive regions — north Florida , central Florida and South Florida — historically have found it difficult to share one vision .
Population growth , however , was one constant they all enjoyed .
Now that it 's gone , the mini-states have joined forces to try to create new economies and reduce their dependence on growth alone .
It 's something other booming states that are now hurting — notably Arizona and Nevada — are learning .
" Multiple regions around the country worked off the business of growth , and they 're all suffering , " Lang says .
" Do n't put all your eggs in one basket . "
Florida has set up public and private partnerships to lead efforts on workforce training , tourism and economic development .
The Senate Select Committee on Florida 's Economy , a bipartisan effort launched in February , has pushed to streamline regulations and cut the cost of doing business .
" We ca n't get out of this recession … by fixing a problem in Miami or Orlando , " says Gaetz , who heads the committee .
" We have to have a state economic policy , develop a workforce . "
One of the state 's most controversial actions , signed into law by Republican Gov. Charlie Crist in June : Rewrite Florida 's 25 - year - old growth restrictions by lifting a state mandate that required developers in more urban areas to pay for new roads .
It 's a move opposed by environmental groups such as 1000 Friends of Florida .
Local communities now will decide whether to charge such fees .
" The overarching economic policy of growth management was approved when Florida was bursting at the seams , " Gaetz says .
" Economic policy ought to be tied to economic reality . "
The state also is pushing for : • Improved education .
The Quality Counts report by Education Week , a national journal published by a non-profit group , ranked Florida in six key areas of K - 12 education .
It was 31st in 2006 , 14th in 2007 and 10th this year .
Its overall grade jumped from C+ to B — .
The state two years ago began requiring school districts to create at least one career academy that focuses on one field such as health sciences .
" It 's a career pathway , " says Loretta Costin , vice chancellor for Career and Adult Education .
" It helps high school students become actively engaged . "
At the WorkForce One center here , one of 24 regional operations run by the state and private interests , some of the jobless who come for help are taught how to draft résumés and apply for work online .
Others are enrolled in local schools to retrain for jobs of the future : technology , health care , engineering and all things " green . "
Angelo de Santis , 25 , has an associate degree in business administration from Miami Dade College .
That worked well until he was laid off in February as an information technology analyst .
Through WorkForce
One , he will take computer classes to earn an advanced certification .
" It 's going to take a while for the economy and the country to recover , " de Santis says .
" At the same time , the mentality of people in this state is going to have to shift .
Technology is one of those areas that we will always need . "
• Alternative energy .
Eric Silagy , vice president of Florida Power & Light , the state 's largest energy supplier , says , " We 're building three solar plants right now .
It will take Florida from not even being on the solar map to being the second - largest producer in the nation ( after California ) . "
By the end of next year , the plants will produce 110 megawatts of electricity , enough for 35,000 homes and businesses .
•
High tech , medical and bioscience .
A " high - tech corridor " stretching along Interstate 4 from Tampa to Orlando is anchored by the University of Central Florida in Orlando and the University of South Florida in Tampa and St. Petersburg .
The area also is home to cancer research centers , bio-medical engineering companies and oceanographic centers .
Among them : California - based Burnham Institute for Medical Research , which chose Orlando for its East Coast expansion ; SRI International set up a facility in St. Petersburg that will research environmental health and security .
On the Atlantic coast , the Scripps Research Institute and Torrey Pines Institute for Molecular Studies — both based in San Diego — set up shop in Jupiter and Port St. Lucie , respectively .
A housing rebound ?
Finding an upside to the real estate market is difficult when " For Sale " signs sprout in every third or fourth front yard on some streets of upscale neighborhoods here .
Like many other states , however , Florida is seeing some heartening signs after the housing market collapsed .
From a peak in 2006 of $ 248,300 , the median price of existing , single - family homes — where half cost more and half less — has fallen 41 % to $ 147,600 in July .
That has triggered a surge in home buying .
" We 're experiencing a tremendous amount of transactions , up 35 % year over year for the first six months , and it 's being driven by first - time homebuyers , " says Rei Mesa , president of Prudential Florida Real Estate .
Despite the precipitous price drop , many economists expect Florida housing values to remain higher than those in the rest of the Southeast .
That may entice retirees and families to move from northern states to Georgia or North Carolina instead of Florida , says University of Florida economist David Denslow .
Already , some Floridians such as Linden and Nancy Anderson are leaving .
The Andersons moved to South Florida from New York in 1985 seeking a safer place for their teenage son .
" When we used to come down here on vacation , I liked what I saw , " says Linden , now 69 , who worked as a ramp serviceman for now - defunct Eastern Airlines and later as a shuttle bus driver for Hertz .
They bought a house in Kendall , 20 miles south of Miami , when prices were low but later bought a larger home when prices were rising rapidly .
He has n't worked since heart surgery .
Nancy , 68 , has gone back to work part time as a dental assistant .
She complains that Florida wages are low while the cost of living is high .
They 're ready to move to Georgia to be close to their son and 4 - year - old grandson , but they can't sell their house .
Its value has already dropped $ 100,000 to about $ 260,000 .
Says Nancy : " I 'm stuck . "

SAN DIEGO —
In all the Comic - Con International fuss , it was easy to lose track of the winning entries in the annual Atom Films Star Wars Fan Movie Challenge .
It ’s an annual event now , with fans selecting their favorites and George Lucas himself picking his chosen winner in and around the geek gathering .
You can find the top finishers here .
Lucas ’ pick was “ Star Wars : Retold ” ( right ) , an animated visualization of one non -fan ’s recap of the saga .
But , if this reporter had a vote , it would go to the animated children ’s book - style short , “ Star Wars in a Notebook . ”
The gorgeous cut - out visualizations of the characters should really find their way into the mainstream media somewhere .

Barack Obama waves after landing at O'Hare airport in Chicago .
Obama returns to Chicago
SHAKER HEIGHTS , Ohio - President Obama left the Cleveland area and an afternoon of health care reform events for two Democratic National Committee fundraisers in Chicago , where he struck a defensive and at times defiant tone about his top priority .
After touching down in his home city for the third time since taking office , Obama first attended a $ 15,200 - a- person dinner at the Lincoln Park home his campaign fundraiser Penny Pritzker , where he took a shot at the media for what he deemed its " lack of sustained focus on the facts " concerning health care reform , which he said " makes it very difficult " for him .
Advertisement
Then he moved on to an event at the Hyatt Regency , where he defiantly told a crowd of about 750 donors , " We are going to pass health care reform in 2009 . "
And he used the backdrop of the street - fighter politics that define his home city to fire back at his Republican critics — one of whom , Sen .
Jim DeMint , he said has told the GOP that defeating health care reform would “ break ” Obama .
Let me tell you something , " Obama said .
" I 'm from Chicago .
I do n't break . "
Obama tried to put the best face on the setback to his reform plans he was dealt Thursday , after Senate Majority Leader Harry Reid 's announcement .
" So even though we still have a few issues to work out , what 's remarkable about this point is not how far we have left to go , it 's how far we 've already come , " Obama said .
" I understand how easy it is for folks in Washington to become consumed by the game of politics . "
He did his fair share of criticizing Washington and " the status quo " on health care , and declared the country to be " at an unmistakable crossroad . "
" There 's some in Washington who want us to go down the path that we 've already traveled for the last decade or so , " Obama said , " the path where we just throw up our hands and say , ' Oh this is just too tough . ' "
Earlier Obama worked a room of over 100 people and posed for pictures at Pritzker 's home , where guests nibbled on gazpacho shooters and watermelon salad .
He told the donors that opposition to his health care reform bill " gets on my nerves .
It frustrates me that we 'd even be suggesting the status quo is the best we can do . "
He also praised his administration , saying that it had " reset relations not just with Russia " but with the world .
" Anti-Americanism is no longer fashionable , " he said .
He made similar statements at the Hyatt fundraiser , where he also credited his administration with being able to " pull the economy back from the brink . "
The Hyatt event was billed as a " Welcome Home " reception , where Obama met the coach and quarterback of the Chicago Bears — Lovie Smith and Jay Cutler — as well as retired Chicago Bulls point guard B.J. Armstrong and Tracy McGrady of the Houston Rockets .
" I 'm honored to be a part of the welcoming group to welcome home my favorite son , " Smith told the crowd .
" I have the audacity of hope that the Chicago Bears will someday be visiting the White House giving the president a Chicago Bears football to toss around on the South Lawn . "
Obama was basking in a sports glow after his favorite baseball team pitched a perfect game , and said somebody asked him which was a bigger deal : the White Sox 's perfect game or the Dow going over 9,000 .
" And I said I promise you , I promise you , a perfect game , " Obama said .
" That 's big . "
The president wrapped himself in the hometown welcome .
Some of the first words he spoke during remarks at the Hyatt were , " It 's good to be home . "
" It has now been six months since Michelle and Sasha and Malia and Marian Robinson , my mother - in - law , said goodbye and moved into a nice little spot in Washington , D.C. , " Obama said .
" And we arrived there at an incredibly difficult moment in this country 's history . "
At one point in his remarks a woman yelled , " Give 'em hell , Barack . "
Obama reiterated his pitch that " health insurance reform " is not just about the uninsured — although he said helping them is " a moral imperative " — but about lowering costs and increasing quality for Americans who have coverage .
The two events are expected to raise as much as $ 3 million for the DNC .
Arsène Wenger said yesterday he will not sign any more players to boost his young squad , even as Arsenal announced record earnings which showed their manager could have almost £ 80 m to spend if he wanted to .
Arsenal 's income , published in the club 's accounts for the 12 months to 31 May this year , was £ 313.3 m , the largest annual turnover ever recorded by a British football club .
The club 's profit , after tax , was £ 35 m , boosted by sales of apartments in the old Highbury stadium which had previously stalled in the economic downturn .
The accounting period did not include Wenger 's lucrative player trading this summer , in which Arsenal received £ 42 m for Emmanuel Adebayor and Kolo Touré from football 's new big spenders , Manchester City .
Yet speaking before tomorrow 's Champions League tie at home to Olympiakos , Wenger took the opportunity to restate his faith in Arsenal 's current squad and explain why he will not be spending the windfall in the January transfer window .
" There is money to spend but at the moment I am very happy with the squad I have , " said Wenger .
" It 's not because I 'm against spending money ; I have nothing against spending money .
It is not a personal thing , it is just that I have a squad that is strong enough to compete . "
Wenger mentioned by name several of the young players he rates so highly , and pointed to two more , Andrey Arshavin and Thomas Vermaelen , to show that he does spend money on signings he believes will add quality to the squad .
However , he argued that if he were to spend money on more star signings , they would swell the wage bill , and arrive at the expense of the players already competing for places .
" I do not spend money because out of tomorrow 's squad is [ Samir ] Nasri , [ Theo ] Walcott , [ Nicklas ] Bendtner .
And people want me to buy strikers , but where do I put them ?
I do n't know .
I have to then lose players who , for me , are world class . "
The accounts scotch the speculation which has dogged Arsenal since the recession hit , that the Highbury Square development , which was intended to be a £ 100 m profit - maker , had become a financial millstone .
Despite the problems committed buyers have had raising mortgages since the onset of the credit crunch , Arsenal have now sold 445 of the 655 Highbury apartments .
The debt on that property development , which stood at £ 133 m six months ago , has been reduced to £ 47 m and Arsenal have refinanced the loan to be repayable in December next year .
The position is now healthy enough for Arsenal 's chief executive , Ivan Gazidis , presenting his first set of accounts since joining the club in January , to say confidently : " We anticipate it is likely we will make a profit out of that [ Highbury Square ] development , which will then be available to the football side .
Exactly what the profit will be , and when it will be realised , will depend on the strength of the property market . "
The previous record turnover for a British football club was earned by Manchester United , who made £ 256.2 m in 2007 - 08 , a figure Arsenal surpassed by almost £ 60 m last year .
As a football club , though , Arsenal , boosted by a consistently full Emirates Stadium , still fall £ 30 m behind United ; the record figure does include the exceptional £ 88 m from the sale of the apartments .
Wenger 's record as a prodigious earner , not spender , from transfers continued ; the accounts record a £ 23.2 m profit from the sales of Alexander Hleb and Justin Hoyteto Barcelona and Middlesbrough respectively , plus sell - on clauses for former players David Bentley and Lassana Diarra .
The club 's profit , added to the £ 42 m received for Adebayor and Touré , is almost £ 80 m , but it will not be burning a hole in Wenger 's pocket .
" I am very happy with the squad I have , " Wenger concluded .
" If in December we need to buy someone to add to the squad , I will do it .
" Yet with Arsenal having lost crucial matches at both City and United already this season , Wenger has yet to completely convince Arsenal fans and the football public that he squad does have the depth , and experience , to mount a convincing challenge for trophies .

THE number of Australians dying overseas skyrocketed as an increasing number of travellers took advantage of cheap international airfares .
Figures provided to The Daily Telegraph revealed Thailand was the destination where more Australian holiday makers died .
Blog with our Travel Editor Mike Smith :
The travel safety tips you cannot ignore
Yet - to - be - released Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade figures showed that in 2008 - 09 , 1038 died while on holiday , up from 994 the previous year and a huge jump from 2004 - 05 when 642 perished .
The number of Australians arrested overseas also soared , cracking the 1000 mark in 2008 - 09 .
According to the latest figures , Thailand , the US , Indonesia and China were the main destinations where Aussie tourists were getting into legal trouble .
New Zealand topped the list for the most popular Australian tourist destination in 2008 - 09 , with nearly one million visitors .
It was also a relatively safe place to visit and recorded just 22 Australian deaths .
Thailand was fifth of the top 10 destination list with 378,000 visitors but recorded the most Australian tourist deaths with 105 .
The US accommodated 500,000 Australian tourists and recorded 50 deaths , while Indonesia recorded 58 deaths among 436,000 visitors .
The number of Australians going to hospital overseas shot up to 1480 cases in the past financial year - a 130 per cent increase from 2004 - 05 .
In Thailand , Indonesia and China alone there were 522 hospital admissions in 2008 - 09 .
While there were just 81 Aussies taken to hospital across the US , it was the destination of choice to get into trouble with the law .
In the 12 months to June more than 200 Australians were arrested in the US , well above the 63 arrested in Thailand and the 60 detained in China .
Hong Kong and Singapore followed closely behind .
The number of Australians in overseas prisons as of June 30 was 223 - 60 more than four years ago .
The US had the most Australians behind bars ( 36 ) , followed by New Zealand ( 30 ) and the UK ( 24 ) .
In the past few years the number of Australians overseas seeking help from the Federal Government had soared to nearly 200,000 cases in the past financial year .
DFAT 's smartraveller website advised Australians that if they could n't afford to take out travel insurance when they head overseas , they really can't afford to travel .
" Every day our consular officers deal with human tragedies involving the death , injury or hospitalisation of Australians abroad , " the smartraveller website said .

The browser wars have really been heating up again lately .
Thanks to Mozila ’s Firefox , Internet Explorer is no longer the undisputed king , and browsers are popping up all over the place trying grab a piece of the pie .
A new browser project called RockMelt is in development – and it ’s backed by Mosaic developer and Netscape founder Marc Andreessen .
Marc Andreessen developed Mosaic together with Eric Bina in 1992 and 1993 .
Mosaic was the first browser to really bring the internet to the masses , thanks to its easy installation and usable interface ; an interface which has remained more or less unchanged ever since .
Mosaic was also the first browser to render images inline .
Contrary to popular belief , however , Mosaic was n’t the first graphical browser .
Still , Mosaic became popular , and in the end formed the basis for Netscape , whose parent company was founded by Marc Andreessen .
As we all know , Netscape played a major role in popularising the web , a role it had to relinquish to Internet Explorer .
Netscape still lives on though through Firefox , the browser which reignited the browser wars thanks to being a better product than Internet Explorer 6 .
So , Marc Andreessen knows his browsers .
He was a key player in the history of two of the most important browsers , so when he decides to put his weight behind a new browser project , you can be sure people will notice .
RockMelt , as the project is called , is currently nothing more than a web page , and Andreessen is very reluctant to say anything about it .
What we do know is that several people from one of his former companies – Opsware – are involved , and that at least one of them worked at Netscape too , back in the day .
Just yet another browser project to keep an eye on .
Phusion Passenger is an Apache and Nginx module for deploying Ruby on Rails web applications , and is mainly focused on ease of use and stability .
Introducing the announcements mailing list
We now have an announcement - only mailing list for new Phusion Passenger releases .
This mailing list can also be used for packagers to announce packaging updates .
Future versions will no longer be announced on the discussion board , so discussion board subscribers who wish to be notified about new versions should subscribe to this announcements mailing list as well .
If you ’re a packager and you ’d like to have posting access to the announcements list , then please post a message on the discussion board .
Recent changes
Phusion Passenger is under constant maintenance and development .
We are pleased to announce Phusion Passenger version 2.2.5 .
This is a bug fix release .
The following things have changed since 2.2.4 :
[ Apache ]
Small file uploads are now buffered ; fixes potential DoS attack Phusion Passenger buffers large file uploads to temp files so that it does n’t block applications while an upload is in progress , but it sent small uploads directly to the application without buffering it .
This could result in a potential DoS attack : the client can send many small , incomplete file uploads to the server , and this would block all application processes until a timeout occurs .
In order to solve this problem , Phusion Passenger now buffers small file uploads in memory .
Bug # 356 .
[ Apache ]
Fixed support for mod_rewrite passthrough rules Mod_rewrite passthrough rules were not properly supported because of a bug fix for supporting encoded slashes ( % 2f ) in URLs .
Unfortunately , due to bugs / limitations in Apache , we can support either encoded slashes or mod_rewrite passthrough rules , but not both ; supporting one will break the other .
Support for mod_rewrite passthrough rules is now enabled by default ; that is , support for encoded slashes is disabled by default .
A new configuration option , PassengerAllowEncodedSlashes , has been added .
Turning this option on will enable support for encoded slashes and disable support for mod_rewrite passthrough rules .
Issue # 113 and issue # 230 .
[ Apache ]
Added a configuration option for resolving symlinks in the document root path Phusion Passenger 2.2.0 and higher no longer resolves symlinks in the document root path in order to properly support Capistrano - style directory structures .
The exact behavior is documented in the Users Guide , section " How Phusion Passenger detects whether a virtual host is a web application " .
However , some people relied on the old behavior .
A new configuration option , PassengerResolveSymlinksInDocumentRoot , has been added to allow reverting back to the old behavior .
Patch contributed by Locaweb .
[ Apache ] mod_env variables are now also passed through CGI environment headers Prior to version 2.2.3 , environment variables set by mod_env are passed to the application as CGI environment headers , not through Ruby ’s ENV variable .
In the last release we introduced support for setting ENV environment variables with mod_env , and got rid of the code for setting CGI environment headers .
It turns out that some people relied on the old behavior , we so now environment variables set with mod_env are set in both ENV and in the CGI environment .
Fixes bug # 335 .
[ Apache ]
Fixed compilation problems on some Linux systems with older versions of Apache
If you used to see compilation errors like this : ext / apache2/Configuration.cpp:554 : error : expected primary - expression before '. ' token then this version should compile properly .
[ Apache ]
Fixed I/O timeouts for communication with backend processes
Got rid of the code for enforcing I /O timeouts when reading from or writing to a backend process .
This caused more problems than it solved .
[ Nginx ]
Support for streaming responses ( e.g. Comet or HTTP push )
Buffering of backend responses is now disabled .
This fixes support for streaming responses , something which the Apache version has supported for a while now .
One can generate streaming responses in Ruby on Rails like this : render : text => lambda { |response , output| 10_000. times do |i| output .
write ( " hello #{i} !
" ) end } [ Nginx ]
Installer now installs Nginx 0.7.61 by default Previously it installed 0.6.37 by default .
[ Nginx ]
Fixed the installer ’s –extra -configure - flags flag when combined with –auto - download Arguments passed to –extra - configure - flags were not being passed to the Nginx configure script when –auto - download is given .
This has been fixed : bug # 349 .
[ Nginx ]
Fixed unnecessary download of PCRE
The installer now checks whether PCRE is installed in / opt / local ( e.g. MacPorts ) as well before concluding that it is n’t installed and going ahead with downloading PCRE .
Fixed STDERR capturing
While spawning an application , Phusion Passenger captures any output written to STDERR so that it can show them later if the application failed to start .
This turns out to be much more difficult than expected , with all kinds of corner cases that can mess up this feature .
For example , if the Rails log file is not writable , then this can cause Rails to crash with a bizarre and unhelpful error message whenever it tries to write to STDERR : /!\ FAILSAFE /!\
Thu Aug 20 14:58:39 +1000 2009 Status : 500 Internal Server Error undefined method `[ ] ' for nil : NilClass Some applications reopen STDERR to a log file .
This did n’t work .
Of all of these problems have been fixed now .
( Bug # 332 ) Fixed some bugs in application sources preloading Rails >= 2.2 already preloads the application sources , in which case Phusion Passenger was n’t supposed to perform it ’s own preloading , but the Rails >= 2.2 detection code was bugged .
This has been fixed .
Rails < 2.2 does n’t preload the application sources by itself , but there should be a certain order with which the sources are preloaded , otherwise preloading could fail in some applications .
We now enforce a specific load order : first models , then controllers , then helpers .
Bug # 359 .
Fixed a few bugs in WSGI compliance PATH_INFO is supposed to be set to the request URI , but without the query string and without the base URI .
This has been fixed : bug # 360 .
Other things Fixed some Ruby 1.9 - specific crashes caused by encoding issues .
Bug # 354 .
Fixed loading of config / environment.rb on Ruby 1.9.2 , because Ruby 1.9.2 no longer has " . " in the default load path .
Patch by metaljastix , issue # 368 .
The Users Guide for Apache now mentions something about correct permissions for application directories .
Fixed compilation problems on IA - 64 ( bug # 118 ) .
We also reduced the stack sizes for the threads by half , so Phusion Passenger should use even less virtual memory now .
Fixed compilation problems on Linux systems with ARM CPU .
Fixed a few compatibility problems with 64 - bit OpenBSD .
Fixed a few typos and minor bugs .
Wait , what about Snow Leopard ?
There are some known issues with Snow Leopard , though we do not yet know what these issues exactly are , what causes them or how to fix them .
We have n’t upgraded yet because Snow Leopard is sold out in all local stores .
Please check the discussion board for updates about Snow Leopard support .
How do I upgrade to 2.2.5 ?
Via a gem
Please install it with the following command :
gem install passenger
Next , run :
passenger - install - apache2- module
Or , if you ’re an Nginx user :
passenger - install- nginx - module
Please do n’t forget to copy & paste the Apache / Nginx config snippet that the installer gives you .
Via a native Linux package
John Leach from Brightbox has kindly provided an Ubuntu 8.04 package for Phusion Passenger .
The package is available from the Brightbox repository which you can find at :
http://apt.brightbox.net
Add the following line to the Third Party Software Sources :
deb http://apt.brightbox.net hardy main
( The simplest way to do that is to create a file in /etc/apt/sources.list.d/ containing the deb instruction , and then run ‘ apt - get update ’ ) .
Once you ’ve done this then you can install Phusion Passenger by running :
sudo apt - get install libapache2 - mod - passenger
- or-
sudo apt - get install nginx - brightbox
( Note that John is currently packaging 2.2.5 , so it might take a while before this release shows up in the apt repository . )
Final
Phusion Passenger is provided to the community for free .

Another kernel NULL pointer vulnerability
From : Tavis Ormandy < taviso-AT-sdf.lonestar.org >
To : full - disclosure-AT-lists.grok.org.uk , bugtraq-AT-securityfocus.com
Subject : Linux NULL pointer dereference due to incorrect proto_ops initializations Date : Thu , 13 Aug 2009 20:57:53 +0200 Message -ID : <20090813185753.GA5961@sdf.lonestar.org >
Archive - link : Article , Thread
Linux NULL pointer dereference due to incorrect proto_ops initializations
-------------------------------------------------------------------------
In the Linux kernel , each socket has an associated struct of operations called proto_ops which contain pointers to functions implementing various features , such as accept , bind , shutdown , and so on .
If an operation on a particular socket is unimplemented , they are expected to point the associated function pointer to predefined stubs , for example if the " accept " operation is undefined it would point to sock_no_accept ( ) .
However , we have found that this is not always the case and some of these pointers are left uninitialized .
This is not always a security issue , as the kernel validates the pointers at the call site , such as this example from sock_splice_read : static ssize_t sock_splice_read ( struct file * file , loff_t * ppos , struct pipe_inode_info * pipe , size_t len , unsigned int flags ) { struct socket * sock = file -> private_data ; if ( unlikely ( !
sock->ops->splice_read ) ) return - EINVAL ; return sock ->ops->splice_read ( sock , ppos , pipe , len , flags ) ; }
But we have found an example where this is not the case ; the sock_sendpage ( ) routine does not validate the function pointer is valid before dereferencing it , and therefore relies on the correct initialization of the proto_ops structure .
We have identified several examples where the initialization is incomplete : - The SOCKOPS_WRAP macro defined in include / linux / net.h , which appears correct at first glance , was actually affected .
This includes PF_APPLETALK , PF_IPX , PF_IRDA , PF_X25 and PF_AX25 families .
- Initializations were missing in other protocols , including PF_BLUETOOTH , PF_IUCV , PF_INET6 ( with IPPROTO_SCTP ) , PF_PPPOX and PF_ISDN .
--------------------
Affected Software
------------------------
All Linux 2.4/2.6 versions since May 2001 are believed to be affected : - Linux 2.4 , from 2.4.4 up to and including 2.4.37.4 - Linux 2.6 , from 2.6.0 up to and including 2.6.30.4
--------------------
Consequences
-----------------------
This issue is easily exploitable for local privilege escalation .
In order to exploit this , an attacker would create a mapping at address zero containing code to be executed with privileges of the kernel , and then trigger a vulnerable operation using a sequence like this : /* ... */ int fdin = mkstemp ( template ) ; int fdout = socket ( PF_PPPOX , SOCK_DGRAM , 0 ) ; unlink ( template ) ; ftruncate ( fdin , PAGE_SIZE ) ; sendfile ( fdout , fdin , NULL , PAGE_SIZE ) ; /* ... */ Please note , sendfile ( ) is just one of many ways to cause a sendpage operation on a socket .
Successful exploitation will lead to complete attacker control of the system .
-------------------
Mitigation -----------------------
Recent kernels with mmap_min_addr support may prevent exploitation if the sysctl vm.mmap_min_addr is set above zero .
However , administrators should be aware that LSM based mandatory access control systems , such as SELinux , may alter this functionality .
It should also be noted that all kernels up to 2.6.30.2 are vulnerable to published attacks against mmap_min_addr .
-------------------
Solution -----------------------
Linus committed a patch correcting this issue on 13th August 2009 .

A fast - growing FBI data - mining system billed as a tool for hunting terrorists is being used in hacker and domestic criminal investigations , and now contains tens of thousands of records from private corporate databases , including car - rental companies , large hotel chains and at least one national department store , declassified documents obtained by Wired.com show .
Headquartered in Crystal City , Virginia , just outside Washington , the FBI 's National Security Branch Analysis Center ( NSAC ) maintains a hodgepodge of data sets packed with more than 1.5 billion government and private - sector records about citizens and foreigners , the documents show , bringing the government closer than ever to implementing the " Total Information Awareness " system first dreamed up by the Pentagon in the days following the Sept. 11 attacks .
Such a system , if successful , would correlate data from scores of different sources to automatically identify terrorists and other threats before they could strike .
The FBI is seeking to quadruple the known staff of the program .
But the proposal has long been criticized by privacy groups as ineffective and invasive .
Critics say the new documents show that the government is proceeding with the plan in private , and without sufficient oversight .
The FBI 's Data - Mining Ore
Composed of government information , commercial databases and records acquired in criminal and terrorism probes , the FBI 's National Security Branch Analysis Center is too broad to be considered mission - focused , but still too patchy to be Orwellian .
Here 's the data we know about .
• International travel records of citizens and foreigners
• Financial forms filed with the Treasury by banks and casinos

" We have a situation where the government is spending fairly large sums of money to use an unproven technology that has a possibility of false positives that would subject innocent Americans to unnecessary scrutiny and impinge on their freedom , " said Kurt Opsahl , a lawyer with the Electronic Frontier Foundation .
" Before the NSAC expands its mission , there must be strict oversight from Congress and the public . "
The FBI declined to comment on the program .
Among the data in its archive , the NSAC houses more than 55,000 entries on customers of the Cendant Hotel chain , now known as Wyndham Worldwide , which includes Ramada Inn , Days Inn , Super 8 , Howard Johnson and Hawthorn Suites .
The entries are for hotel customers whose names matched those on a long list the FBI provided to the company .
Another 730 records come from the rental car company Avis , which used to be owned by Cendant .
Those records were derived from a one - time search of Avis 's database against the State Department 's old terrorist watch list .
An additional 165 entries are credit card transaction histories from the Sears department store chain .
Like much of the data used by NSAC , the records were likely retained at the conclusion of an investigation , and added to NSAC for future data mining .
It 's unclear how the FBI got the records .
In the past , companies have been known to voluntarily hand over customer data to government data - mining experiments – notably , in 2002 , JetBlue secretly provided a Pentagon contractor with 5 million passenger itineraries , for which it later apologized .
But the FBI also has broad authority to demand records under the Patriot Act , using so - called " national security letters " – a kind of self - issued subpoena that 's led to repeated abuses being uncovered by the Justice Department 's inspector general .
Wyndham Worldwide did not respond to repeated requests for comment .
Sears declined comment .
Wired.com 's analysis of more than 800 pages of documents obtained under our Freedom of Information
Act request show the FBI has been continuously expanding the NSAC system and its goals since 2004 .
By 2008 , NSAC comprised 103 full - time employees and contractors , and the FBI was seeking budget approval for another 71 employees , plus more than $ 8 million for outside contractors to help analyze its growing pool of private and public data .
A long - term planning document from the same year shows the bureau ultimately wants to expand the center to 439 people .
As described in the documents , the system is both a meta - search engine – querying many data sources at once – and a tool that performs pattern and link analysis .
The NSAC is an analytic Swiss army knife .
The FBI used the system to locate a suspected Al Qaeda operative with expertise in biological agents who was hiding out in Houston .
And when law enforcement officials got information suggesting members of a Pakistani terrorist group had obtained jobs as Philadelphia taxi drivers , the NSAC was tapped to help the city 's police force run background checks on Philadelphia cabbies .
( A Jordanian - born Philly cab driver was convicted in 2008 for his part in a plot to attack the Fort Dix army base in New Jersey , but there 's no evidence of a connection between the investigations . )
And when the FBI lost track of terrorism suspects swept in the evacuation from Hurricane Katrina in 2005 , it created a standing order in the system to flag any activity by the missing targets .
Additionally , the FBI shared NSAC data with the Pentagon 's controversial Counter - Intelligence Field Activity office , a secretive domestic - spying unit which collected data on peace groups , including the Quakers , until it was shut down in 2008 .
But the FBI told lawmakers it would be careful in its interactions with that group .
Conventional criminal cases have also benefited .
In a 2004 case against a telemarketing company called Gecko Communications , NSAC used its batch - searching capability to provide prosecutors with detailed information on 192,000 alleged victims of a credit scam .
The feds suspected that Gecko had promised to help the victims improve their credit scores , and then failed to produce results .
NSAC automatically analyzed the victims ' credit records to prove their scores had n't improved , a task that took two days instead of the four - and - a - half years that the U.S. Attorney 's Office had expected to sink into the job .
In December 2006 , the owners and seven office managers at the company were sentenced to prison .
The NSAC was born as two separate systems designed to improve information - sharing between government agencies following the Sept. 11 attacks .
The Foreign Terrorist Tracking Task Force database has been used to screen flight - school candidates and assist anti-terror investigations .
The Investigative Data Warehouse is the more general system , and is the principal element now under expansion .
" The IDW objective was to create a data warehouse that uses certain data elements to provide a single - access repository for information related to issues beyond counterterrorism to include counterintelligence , criminal and cyber investigations , " stated a formerly secret fiscal year 2008 budget request document .
" These missions will be refined and expanded as these capabilities are folded into the NSAC . "
When the bureau unified the systems under the NSAC banner in 2007 , the move set off alarm bells with lawmakers , who thought it sounded a lot like the Pentagon 's widely - criticized Total Information Awareness project , which had sought to identify terrorist sleeper cells by linking up and searching through U.S. credit card , health and communication databases .
The TIA program had moved into the shadows of the intelligence world after Congress voted to revoke most of its funding .
In 2007 , Republican congressman James Sensenbrenner asked the Government Accountability Office to look into the NSAC .
No report has been made public yet .
But the documents obtained by Wired.com show that the FBI has repeatedly downplayed the databases 's capabilities when addressing critics in Congress , while simultaneously talking up – in budget documents – the system 's power to spit out the names of newly suspicious persons .
The FBI deflected criticism from a House committee on June 29 , 2007 , by pointing out a major difference between the NSAC and the shuttered TIA program :
The NSAC , the bureau said , is not as open - ended .
" A mission is usually begun with a list of names or personal identifiers that have arisen during a threat assessment , preliminary or full investigation , " the unsigned response read .
" Those people under investigation are then assessed to determine if they have any association with terrorism or foreign espionage . "
But a formerly secret 2008 funding justification document among the newly released documents suggests the FBI 's pre-crime intentions are much wider that the bureau acknowledged .
The NSAC will also pursue " pattern analysis " as part of its service to the [ National Security Branch ] .
Pattern analysis queries take a predictive model or pattern of behavior and search for that pattern in data sets .
The FBI 's efforts to define predictive models ... should improve efforts to identify " sleeper cells . "
As an example , the FBI said its sophisticated data queries allowed it to identify 165 licensed helicopter pilots who came from countries of interest , and found that six of those had " derogatory " information about them in the NSAC computers .
It sent the leads to FBI field agents in Los Angeles .
The FBI also has ambitious plans to expand its data set , the budget request shows .
Among the items on its wish list is the database of the Airlines Reporting Corporation – a company that runs a backend system for travel agencies and airlines .
A complete database would include billions of American 's itineraries , including all the information found on the front of a ticket and their method of a payment .*
So far , the company has given the FBI nearly 17,000 records , which are now part of NSAC .
Spokesman Allan Mutén said the company gives the FBI records only when presented with a subpoena or a national security letter – which , he adds , has happened quite a bit .
" Nine - eleven was a time and event that piqued the interest of the authorities in airline passenger data , " Mutén said .
The ever - growing size of the database concerns EFF's Opsahl , who has pieced together the best picture of the FBI 's data mining system through other government FOIA requests .
Opsahl cites a October 2008 National Research Council paper that concluded that data mining is a dangerous and ineffective way to identify potential terrorists , which will inevitably generate false positives that subject innocent citizens to invasive scrutiny by their government .
At the same time , Opsahl admits the NSAC is not at the moment the Orwellian system that TIA would have been .
" This is too massive to be based on a particular query , but too narrow to reflect a policy that they are going to out and collect this kind of data systematically , " Opsahl said .
That could change if the FBI gets it hands on the data sources on its 2008 wish list .
That list includes airline manifests sent to the Department of Homeland Security , the national Social Security number database , and the Postal Service 's change - of - address database .
There are also 24 additional databases the FBI is seeking , but those names were blacked out in the released data .
Graphic : Wired.com /Dennis Crothers
* Correction :
This story reported that ARC 's database included information such as date of birth , credit card numbers , names of friends and family , e-mail addresses , meal preferences and health information .
ARC does not have access to the data , which lives in the Passenger Name Record , which is handled by other entities .
ARC only has the data that appears on an airline ticket , and payment method , in order to facilitate payment .
Wired.com regrets the error .

‘ EVIDENCE ’ OF A LIBERAL MEDIA ….
I pay no attention to celebrity - related news , so it never occurred to me to read the Washington Post ‘s obituary of actor Patrick Swayze .
But the Media Research Center ’s Tim Graham checked it out , and found evidence that “ the Washington Post is a liberal newspaper . ”
[ T] oday ’s Adam Bernstein obituary for Patrick Swayze begins obviously by noting his big hits “ Ghost ” and “ Dirty Dancing , ” but does n’t get to “ Red Dawn ” until paragraph 23 .
Even then , Bernstein wrongly suggests he had a supporting role . [ … ]
“ Red Dawn ” was not a prestigious film , but it was a breakout lead role for Swayze , and a completely shocking product coming out of a Hollywood : a movie about American teens fighting a resistance against a Soviet invasion of the United States .
There are clearly no fortysomething Reaganites working in the Washington Post newsroom .
Jamison Foser responded , “ I ’m not kidding .
Graham really wrote that .
It actually happened . ”
Just think , if you ’re not reading conservative blogs , you ’re missing out on all kinds of fascinating insights you probably wo n’t find anywhere else .
Writing a Book : Part Two ( Structure )
I ’ve always wanted to be a great writer , but nobody ’s ever explained how .
So I tried to figure out for myself .
I reread my favorite books , I read just about everything by David Foster Wallace and Robert Caro , I read a lot of New Yorker articles , I got caught up on n+1 .
I read a lot of stuff out loud , to get a feel for the sound of the voice .
( I performed all the brief interviews ( including the powerful “ On His Deathbed … ” ) in Brief Interviews with Hideous Men — incredible fun ; I can completely see why it made John Krasinski want to become an actor . )
In fact , it got to the point where I could n’t resist reading things out loud — some writing just begged to be performed .
I read some writing guides , but none of them were very helpful .
Virginia Tufte ’s Artful Sentences was by far the most interesting , but I ’m not sure it was much practical help .
I ’ve had the best luck with just reading great writing and then taking a stab of writing something of my own .
I also tried to figure out how to structure the writing .
I watched Ira Glass give his standard talk seven or eight different times , I read Mamet ’s On Directing Film , I sat down with Malcolm Gladwell ’s Outliers and tried to take it apart and figure out how it worked .
For some reason , even though the basic ideas are really simple , they ’ve taken me a really really long time to understand .
It ’s quite odd , really .
I saw Ira Glass say the same thing 8 times , but only on the 7th time did I walk away going “ Ohh , that ’s what he means ! ”
And I keep having similar obvious epiphanies .
I think part of the problem is that I was around a lot of really bad storytellers as a kid .
My Dad would tell a joke and it would take so long that I would be tearing my hair out with boredom halfway through .
When it was over I would think , “ Wait , that was the joke ?
I can tell that joke in two lines .
What did he need all those details for ? ”
And since then I ’ve basically been the person who tells jokes in two lines — omitting needless words , using only the barest description , and getting very impatient with people who run long ( which was basically everyone , it seemed to me ) .
I do n’t know if I ’ve begun reading better writers or grown more patient with age , but I ’m beginning to question this approach .
Being spare and interesting is better than being prolix and boring , I ’m still convinced , but there ’s a place for the seemingly - irrelevant detail .
For one thing , what makes a story a story is the irrelevant detail .
Ira Glass demonstrates this by quoting the opening of his show “ Cringe . ”
( You can listen to it on the site there — just click “ Full Episode ” on the left side .
It ’s the first three minutes .
It ’s much better listened to , but if you can ’t , here ’s a transcript : )
IRA : Joe worked at this office where , every now and then , the office manager would bring her nine - year - old to work .
Good kid .
Kind of tomboy - ish .
JOE : And she would just kind of help out around the office .
She would pass mail out .
And over the time that I was there she and I developed this really — this kind of teasing relationship : she would come into my office and drop my mail off and stick her tongue at me and I would sort of fake chase her down the hallway or something and … you know .
IRA : That ’s sweet .
JOE : Yeah , yeah .
She was an incredibly sweet kid .
[ music ( “ Elephant Walk ” ) begins ]
JOE :
And so there ’s this day when , it ’s early in the morning , I ’ve arrived at the office , and I go into the bathroom , and when I come out of the bathroom , I have my glasses in my shirt - pocket rather than on my head .
And I look down this hallway and I see this small person walking towards me .
And I then get down and start to crab - walk towards her .
So I sort of go down on my haunches , and put my hands up as if they ’re claws and kind of waddle — waddle towards her …
“ At this point , ” Ira quips , “ nobody turns off the radio . ”
JOE : … and as I ’m waddling towards her , I say , in this kind of creepy voice , “ Oh , no !
I ca n’t believe you ’re here today ! ”
And then , at that moment [ laugh ] , as I say “ today , ” she comes into focus .
And I realize , in fact , it ’s not at all the young girl who I thought it was but in fact it ’s one of our interns : a business intern , who is a — a — a midget .
[ more music ]
JOE :
And so she comes into focus and I see her and I ’m horrified and I go bolt upright and I stand up and I say “ Oh , my god , I ’m terribly sorry , I thought you were somebody else . ”
And I think to myself : who could she possibly think that someone else is ?
IRA : [ laughs ] JOE : [ laughs ]
And I wondered at the time : Should I try to explain it to her ?
It seems to me like one of those situations where it only gets worse the more you try to explain it .
The only thing I could do , in fact , was apologize and end all contact with her , forever , right there .
IRA : [ laughs ] [ music ]
IRA : Joel says the women was utterly gracious .
She introduces herself , she tries to put him at ease .
( Apparently , if you ’re a midget , this sort of thing happens all the time . )
But Joel says not only did he cringe when this happened , he cringes every time he tells this story .
People cringe when they hear the story .
And why ?
Seriously : why ?
Yes , why ?
Not so much why do we cringe , but why do we listen so raptly ?
As Ira Glass is the first to point out , it ’s kind of a boring story on its face .
It takes him three minutes to tell , but I can tell it in two lines : A guy named Joe once mistook a midget for a nine - year - old .
He cringes every time he tells the story .
For the purposes of the show , that ’s all he needs to say — the purpose of the story is to set up a show about cringing , and just the idea of mistaking a midget for a nine - year - old is pretty cringeworthy .
But he tells the story at length : except for the very end , he does n’t appear to try to summarize it at all .
And yet , not only do people not get bored — this is apparently what keeps them from getting bored .
( Imagine how quickly people would tune out a show of two - sentence stories .
Personally , I do n’t have to imagine — I see how bored they look when I tell mine .
Which , of course , only makes me rush to tell them faster . )
Glass argues that humans are somehow hardwired for stories .
Once they get started , we have to hear what happened next .
“ One thing happens , and then another thing , and then another thing , ” he says .
“ It ’s got its own momentum — it ’s like a train leaving the station . ”
I think Ira is being too modest .
He ’s an incredibly gifted storyteller ; obviously one of the era ’s greatest ( his show is the # 1 podcast on iTunes ) .
What looks like a simple recording of someone telling a story is the result of a thousand different questions and edits and adjustments .
There ’s a lifetime of experience behind every pause , every lilt of his cadence .
To keep listeners hooked on a story is a very difficult skill .
But what I did n’t realize was that it ’s also a necessary one .
Stories that go by too fast may not be as annoying as stories that are too slow , but they ’re still flawed .
I ’m too insecure to think my storytelling could possibly hold the listener ’s attention , so I rush through the story , hoping to tell them all the key facts before they get bored and wander off .
But it ’s a self - fulfilling prophecy : if you seem uninterested in your story , why should your listener be ?
If you ’re going to tell a story , you need to bite the bullet and be a storyteller .
The trick is realizing that the apparently - irrelevant details are n’t actually irrelevant .
Look again at my transcript of Joe ’s story .
There ’s only one thing I see in it that could be cut out : that “ it ’s early in the morning . ”
Incredibly , every other line in that three - minute story serves an important purpose .
Picking a sentence at random , “ She was an incredibly sweet kid . ” is necessary because Ira ’s comment “ That ’s sweet . ” sounds odd by itself , it needs a response .
( Ira ’s comment is necessary to make sure you see the chasing - down - the - hallway in the right emotional tone .
( That scene , in turn , is necessary to explain the kind of relationship he and the girl had , and so on . ) )
A three minute story , and there ’s hardly a clause you can cut .
That ’s the first rule of storytelling : a story needs to be interesting in its own right .
But the second is equally important : the audience needs a reason to care .
I think part of the reason we ’re wired to follow stories is because a story carries an implied promise : there ’s going to be something good at the end of this .
The way Ira puts it is that there are two tools in storytelling : action , and reflection .
Ira ’s shows ( like Gladwell ’s articles ) open with action .
But the action leads immediately to reflection : look at the story above , there ’s not even a pause between the ending of the story and Ira asking why it is that we cringe .
Ira ’s not just telling the story because it ’s entertaining , he ’s telling it because it makes us cringe and he wants us to think about that feeling .
He goes on to investigate that feeling — to explain what we can learn from the story .
And here again it ’s important to slow down .
There ’s a tendency to think that stories speak for themselves .
First , because there ’s some artistic nobility in this : explaining what a story means is being “ didactic ” and “ preachy , ” it ’s keeping your readers from thinking for themselves , it means your work is n’t really art .
Second , it often seems unnecessary : you ’ve spent hours — days , weeks , months , years — thinking about your story .
It seems obvious to you what it means .
Maybe you can add a sentence spelling it out for the slow ones , but is n’t that enough ?
It ’s not , of course .
Your head is full of evidence , examples , models , implications — all of which your readers are n’t just going to magically intuit .
You need to tell them .
Again , I think I was betrayed by bad writing in my youth .
I read a bunch of “ popular ” books that were just dreadful .
I did n’t know that these books were n’t actually meant for reading .
Turns out , you get paid about the same amount for writing a truly great magazine article as you do for a mediocre one and only get a little more attention for the former .
So if you write a really good magazine article , the only way to get rewarded is to turn it into a book .
The problem is that even the longest magazine articles do n’t make for more 30 pages and you can’t really publish a book that short .
So you write a couple hundred pages of filler .
And , in most cases , that only detracts from your great article by watering it down .
You basically just end up repeating yourself a lot in different words .
As a child , I could n’t stand books like that and vowed never to write one .
But again I went too far .
It ’s true , you do n’t need to give three examples of everything you say , but you ca n’t simply give no examples either .
I ’m still trying to figure out where the right balance is .
You should follow me on twitter here .

WASHINGTON ( CNN ) --
A key Senate negotiator said Sunday that President Obama should drop his push for a government - funded public health insurance option because the Senate will never pass it .
President Obama at a town hall meeting earlier this week pushing his health care reform plan .
Democratic Sen. Kent Conrad of North Dakota said it was futile to continue to " chase that rabbit " due to the lack of 60 Senate votes needed to overcome a filibuster .
" The fact of the matter is there are not the votes in the United States Senate for a public option .
There never have been , " Conrad said on " Fox News Sunday . "
His comment signaled a shift in the health care debate , with Obama and senior advisers softening their support for a public option by saying final form of the legislation is less important than the principle of affordable coverage available to all .
At a town hall meeting Saturday in Colorado , Obama said the public option is just one of many issues critical to successfully overhauling the ailing health care system .
" All I 'm saying is ... that the public option , whether we have it or we do n't have it , is not the entirety of health care reform .
This is just one sliver of it , " the president said .
Asked Sunday if Obama would accept a bill lacking a public option , White House spokesman Robert Gibbs said the president insists on more competition in the health insurance marketplace to offer consumers better choices .
" The bottom line ... is :
Do individuals looking for health insurance in the private market have choice and competition ? "
Gibbs said on the CBS program " Face the Nation . "
" If we have that , the president will be satisfied . "
Health and Human Services Secretary Kathleen Sebelius echoed Gibbs , telling CNN's " State of the Union " on Sunday that a final health care bill will include competitive choices for consumers in one form or another .
" There will be a competitor to private insurers , " she said .
" You do n't turn over the whole new marketplace to private insurance companies and trust them to do the right thing .
We need some choices and we need some competition . "
Opponents of overhauling the health care system argue the Democratic proposals under consideration by Congress go too far and will lead to a government takeover of the health care system .
" We have the best health care system in the world , " Republican Sen . Richard Shelby of Alabama told " Fox News Sunday . "
" We need to expand it .
We do not need to destroy it . "
At issue is how to provide coverage for an estimated 46 million uninsured people while reversing a climb in health care costs .
Democratic proposals passed so far by House and Senate committees include a public insurance option , mandates for people to be insured and employers to provide coverage , and an end to insurance companies refusing to cover pre-existing conditions .
Most Republicans oppose the public option and requirements for employers to provide coverage .
They also call for limits on medical malpractice lawsuits -- something Democrats generally do n't favor .
However , the two parties generally agree on a number of provisions contained in the Democratic bills , including increased efficiency in Medicare and Medicaid and focusing on preventive health programs .
Conrad is one of six Senate Finance Committee members -- three Democrats and three Republicans -- who are negotiating a compromise health care bill that would be the only bipartisan proposal so far .
Instead of a public option , the negotiators are considering a plan proposed by Conrad to create nonprofit health insurance cooperatives that could negotiate coverage as a collective for their members .
Conrad said such cooperatives would provide the competition sought by Obama and Democratic leaders to force private insurers to hold down costs and improve practices .
The government would put up initial funding to provide required reserves but would have no other role , he said .
" It 's not a public plan at all in terms of government running it , " Conrad said .
Shelby called the cooperative idea a " step in the right direction " and " a far cry " from other proposals , adding that Obama and Democratic leaders have " read the tea leaves " from town hall meetings around the country .
However , Democratic Rep. Eddie Bernice Johnson of Texas told CNN it would be " very , very difficult " to support a bill that lacked a public health insurance option .
" Without the public option , we 'll have the same number of people uninsured , " Johnson said in a " State of the Union " interview .
" If the insurance companies wanted to insure these people now , they 'd be insured . "
She added that " an option that would give the private insurance companies a little competition " is " the only way " to be sure that insurance is available to low - income people and people without employer - provided coverage .
Meanwhile , leaders of organizations representing America 's doctors and senior citizens defended the proposed health care overhaul that their groups had opposed in past years .
Dr. J. James Rohack , president of the American Medical Association , and John Rother of AARP -- formerly the American Association of Retired Persons -- told " Fox News Sunday " a comprehensive overhaul sought by Democrats was necessary .
" There are some moving parts that if you just do one and do n't do the other , you 're going to have unintended consequences , " said Rohack , head of the nation 's largest doctors ' advocacy group .
Rother , executive vice president of policy and strategy for the largest senior citizens ' advocacy group , said properly addressing excessive health care costs and waste requires addressing both health insurance coverage and how health care treatment is delivered .
Both men rejected accusations that a health care overhaul would bring rationing of health treatment based on bureaucratic measures such as cost and economic productivity of patients .
" There 's a myth that rationing does n't occur right now , " Rohack said , noting that some companies currently deny coverage for pregnancy as a pre-existing condition .
" That 's why this bill is so important , " Rohack said .
" It gets rid of rationing happening right now " and leaves decisions to patients and doctors .
Rohack also condemned claims by some Republicans that a provision in one House bill would lead to so - called " death panels " encouraging euthanasia of senior citizens .
" That 's absolutely wrong , it 's a falsehood , " he said , adding that the provision was intended to provide government support for consultations between patients and their doctors .
Spreading of the " death panel " rumor by some conservative commentators and some Republican politicians prompted emotional opposition at town hall meetings across the country .
Senate negotiators on a compromise bill say they have dropped the provision from their proposal due to potential misinterpretation of the intent .

While many people in the US may have wondered this summer what happened to Global Warming , other parts of the world showed some new affects of rising temperatures .
In the US , the map shows that Texas was the 8th warmest on record , Florida was at the fourth highest average temperature for any summer since 1895 and Washington had it 7th warmest summer .
But , other parts of the country were decidedly colder .
Michigan went through the 5 coldest summer on record and a number of other states in the Northern Plains came in with the 7th coolest summer .
The US was determined to have gone through the 34th coolest summer on record .
As for the Arctic Ice extent , which many use as a bellweather for Global Warming analysis , the ice extent is growing for the second consecutive year .
Back in 2007 , the ice extent fell to its lowest levels , which prompted media outlets to trumpet some scientific speculation that perhaps the north pole would become devoid of ice for a time .
Of course , these media reports neglected to mention that the scientific probability was well less than 50 % and instead made it sound like it was a hard - fast prediction .
Anyway , the Sea - Ice at the North Pole did not decrease in 2008 but instead increased .
Instead of reporting that the ice grew , the headlines said it was the sccond lowest in recorded history , which only goes back to 1979 .
So far , in 2009 , the ice continues to run above the 2008 levels .
So , do the headlines say that the sea-ice has grown for the second consecutive year ?
Of course not .
Instead the headline say that the “ Arctic Ice Meltdown Greater Than Average Again in 2009 . ”
On the flip side , there is another story afoot that Global Warming may be the reason behind future cooling of the North American continent in the future !
Now , that would cause quite a problem politically .
If the rest of the world gets hotter but Americans feel cooler , then that would probably cause a very large chunk of the American population to oppose any political efforts to curb Global Warming .
See additional Sea Ice Data from Sea -Ice News .
Now , the ice growth seems to fly in the face of global warming advocates and I do not believe that the increasing of ice over two consecutive years made it into the presentation of Al Gore ’s movie .
Nor do I think it was part of any solution posed by climate modeling data on which speculation has been based .
But , it ’s happened .
Then again , the fact that a Northeast Passage has opened up in the sea-ice for a couple of ships kinda fits the whole notion that North America might get colder when everyone else gets warmer .
While one year does not a trend make , it would seem we saw it this year .
This all fits into my contention that no one knows .
We as humans think we have all the answers when in fact , there are no absolutes .
So far , the overall predictions of Mr. Gore ’s movie and even the IPCC report are not going as planned .
Arctic Sea
Ice is growing over the past two years and much of the United States is cooler .
But , on the other hand , other parts of the world are warming and there is that little issue of the Northeast Passage .
Do n’t believe the hype either way and encourage your politicians to allow the scientific process to conclude in a normal , academic fashion , instead of the current trend of allowing political gamesmanship and opportunism to corrupt the proper methodology .
A gay Toronto couple was detained for 28 days in Dubai for carrying the prescription arthritis drug Celebrex , which is banned in the United Arab Emirates ( UAE ) .
Rocky Sharma and Stephen Macleod , who have been together for 10 years , were stopped upon arrival in Dubai on Aug 2 , where they planned to spend the day before returning to Toronto from a vacation in India .
Macleod had a bottle of the prescription arthritis medication Celebrex in his suitcase .
They were told Celebrex is a controlled substance in UAE and , even though they did not present themselves to border officials as a couple , both partners were detained .
“ I think they thought we were gay and we would have some party drugs with us , ” says Sharma , who is now safely back at home with his partner .
“ They were definitely targeting people who are young , from the western world and nicely dressed , like they are going to party . ”
The UAE has very tough drug laws .
Even over - the - counter medications that include traces of codeine are restricted .
Possession can result in lengthy jail sentences , heavy fines or the death penalty , according to an advisory issued by the Canadian Department of Foreign Affairs and International Trade ( DFAIT ) .
Calls to DFAIT were not returned before press time .
Sharma says he and Macleod were given limited information about why they were being detained because border officials in the UAE did not speak English .
They were not given an opportunity to contact a lawyer or consular officials but Sharma managed to contact friends at home on his Blackberry , which he had on him at the time of his arrest .
Those friends gave him the emergency contact number of the Canadian embassy in Abu Dhabi , which Sharma called before his Blackberry was confiscated .
Sharma ’s family also contacted DFAIT in Canada but their efforts were stymied by the long weekend .
“ When I sent the message , we were thinking we were going back home , ” says Sharma .
“ That ’s when I took it out of my bag and sent the SOS message .
They were taking us toward the airport , but I ’m glad I sent it because they were taking us to the detention centre .
We were very lucky about that . ”
Sharma and Macleod were forced by their captors to submit urine samples for drug testing .
Sharma says they were told they were being held pending the results of the urine tests .
They were kept in a filthy prison cell with eight other prisoners for 10 days before they were sent to separate prisons .
“ If you get a blanket and a pillow you ’re very lucky , ” he says .
“ For the first few days we slept on the floor .
The bathroom conditions were just a hole in the ground for 200 people .
Food was just rice with some kind of sauce on it three times a day . ”
For the next 18 days , Sharma and Macleod could only communicate with each other via the case worker provided by the Canadian consulate .
“ That was one of the worst parts , because I had no idea how he was doing , he had no idea how I was doing , ” says Sharma .
“ We were told by the embassy not to even hint that we were a couple , to act like we were only friends , and that ’s what we did . ”
Homosexuality is punishable by death in UAE .
Even when the couple was formally declared innocent by the Dubai prosecution on Aug 18 , they were kept another 11 days while their paperwork was processed .
DFAIT currently advises travellers to the UAE to “ exercise high degree of caution ” but does not issue an official warning against travel .
Anyone carrying personal medication is advised to consult the UAE Ministry of Health Drug Control Department before travelling to confirm that the medication is allowed in the country .
Sharma says he and his partner will never return to the Emirates after their experience .
“ We ’ll never go back to that country , ” he says .
“ What people need to know is that we were stopped because they thought we were gay guys .
They thought we might be carrying party drugs . ”
September 24 , 2009 – Barrie , Ontario Canada – Daily headlines read “ Marijuana grow - ops busted ” .
What difference does it make ?
The recent outdoor marijuana ‘ eradication ’ efforts by police are glaring examples of the futility of prohibition .
Law enforcement efforts are not ‘ stemming the tide ’ ( or ‘ taking a bite out ’ ) of drugs , nor will they ever do so .
It is all just an expensive show at taxpayer expense to give the public the illusion that something is being accomplished .
Why are n’t journalists asking these important questions ?
Is there evidence that these eradication efforts actually reduce the availability of marijuana on the street ?
The answer is a resounding No !
What percentage of the outdoor crops are police able to destroy ?
How much do these annual eradication efforts cost ( diverted police resources , overtime pay , helicopter use and fuel ) ?
Taxpayers have a right to know the answers to these questions .
This futile and expensive ritual will continue , year after year , until we finally come to our senses and end cannabis prohibition .
Every major study on the cannabis issue has come to the same key conclusion as the 2002 Senate Special Committee on Illegal Drugs .
‘ The prohibition of cannabis jeopardizes the health and well - being of Canadians much more than does the substance itself ’
( Cannabis : Our Position for a Canadian Public Policy , 2002 - http://www.SenateReport.ca).
Every day that we delay the end of this corrupting , harmful policy , the deeper the tentacles of organized crime infiltrate into our communities .
Ending cannabis prohibition is definitely in Canada ’s best interest .

The Road to World War II How Appeasement Failed to Stop Hitler
In the years leading up to World War II , Britain and France underestimated just how determined Adolf Hitler was in his lust for conquest .
The failure of Neville Chamberlain 's policy of appeasement meant war was inevitable .
At least 23 House Democrats already have told constituents or hometown media that they oppose the massive healthcare overhaul touted by President Barack Obama Barack Hussein Obama
It 's now up to health systems to solve our food problems Testing the Electoral College process against judicial overreach Obama steps into The Shade Room to urge ' roommates ' to vote , says White House ' working to keep people from voting '
MORE .
If Republicans offer the blanket opposition they ’ve promised , Speaker Nancy Pelosi ( D - Calif . ) can afford to lose only 38 members of her 256 - member caucus and still pass the bill .

Most Democrats opposed to healthcare reform argue it costs too much , imposes a new tax and fines businesses that do n’t provide insurance to employees .
Some fear that the bill would subsidize abortion .
Many other Democratic members , including those berated by protesters at raucous town hall meetings in August , are still undecided .
A lot could change before the vote , expected late this month .
Voting against a president from your own party is starkly different from defying a Speaker or a committee chairman , and Obama is stepping up his involvement , starting with a speech to a joint session of Congress on Wednesday night .
The Pelosi camp , for its part , sees no reason to be discouraged .
“ The Congress will pass and the president will sign this year health insurance reform that will lower costs , retain choice , improve quality and expand coverage , ” said Pelosi spokesman Nadeam Elshami .
Pelosi has vowed to include in the bill a government - run insurance plan , commonly called a “ public option , ” to compete with private insurers .
Many centrist opponents of the bill do n’t like the public option , or do n’t want to vote on such a controversial plan when it ’s unlikely to become law .
There ’s a chance the House bill wo n’t include it .
Obama has shifted from saying it must be in the bill to saying he wants it in the bill .
House leaders have said they want to see a bill from the Senate Finance Committee before the vote , and that bill is unlikely to include a public option .
But deleting the public option wo n’t make life easier for Pelosi .
At least 60 liberal Democrats have pledged to vote against a healthcare bill with no public option , which they view as watered - down reform .
Rep. Anthony Weiner ( D - N.Y. ) has said dropping the public option completely would lose 100 Democratic votes .
Even Pelosi ’s critics and skeptics have to concede that she has almost never lost in the House since becoming Speaker .
The main exception is the first vote on the $ 700 billion bailout package requested by the Bush administration , which later passed .
She twisted arms one by one in July to pass a climate change bill despite deep skepticism among centrists and Democrats from manufacturing states .
But some of the public backlash from that has frightened and angered centrist and vulnerable members .
Democratic critics have different reasons for opposing the bill , and their opposition varies in its vehemence .
Rep. Eric Massa ( D - N.Y. ) a supporter of a “ single - payer ” system , opposes it because the public option is n’t strong enough .
Other “ single - payer ” supporters in the party ’s left wing could balk as well .
Some are definitive .
There ’s Rep. Gene Taylor ( D - Miss. ) , a Blue Dog who is one of the most conservative members of the Democratic Caucus .
He told a town hall meeting last month , “ I would hope by now that everyone in this room knows that I am not going to vote for the healthcare plan . ”
Rep. John Adler ( D - N.J. ) , a vulnerable Democrat , was equally blunt .
He told a group of constituents last month , “ The bill that ’s coming through the House , with or without the public option , is n’t good for America . ”
Others , such as Rep. Henry Cuellar ( D - Texas ) , say they ca n’t support the bill “ in its current form . ”
The bill is widely expected to change before it goes to the House floor , but if Pelosi keeps the public option in the bill , many centrists will see it as a left - leaning bill .
Rep. Tom Perriello ( D - Va. ) , who unseated an incumbent in 2008 by a scant 745 votes , said at a town hall meeting , “ I am a ‘ no ’ now , but I really want to get to a ‘ yes . ’ ”
And plenty of others are n’t ready to take a position .
“ I ’ll do the best I can , but I do n’t know what ’s the right thing to do yet , ” Rep.

American death - tech goliath Boeing has announced a long - delayed in - flight firing for the smaller of its two aeroplane raygun - cannon prototypes , the Advanced Tactical Laser ( ATL ) .
The ATL blaster , mounted in a Hercules transport aircraft , apparently " defeated " an unoccupied stationary vehicle .
' ET '- ha !
And they keep denying they have alien assistance !
" This milestone demonstrates that directed energy weapon systems will transform the battlespace and save lives , " said Boeing exec Greg Hyslop .
" The ATL team has earned a distinguished place in the history of weapon system development . "
" The bottom line is that ATL works , and works very well , " added corporate raygun honcho Gary Fitzmire .
The ATL is much smaller than Boeing 's headlining laser weapon , the jumbo - jet - mounted Airborne Laser ( ABL ) , intended to blast enemy ICBMs as they soar upward from pad or silo .
Rather the ATL is intended to pick off individual ground targets , somewhat in the fashion of existing Hercules - based side - firing AC - 130 gunships .
Indeed Boeing has referred to the ATL in the past as its " Laser Gunship " .
ATL does resemble the ABL in some important respects , however .
Like the bigger weapon , it is a chemically - fuelled laser rather than a solid - state electrically powered one , meaning that it can fire only a limited number of blasts before its sealed , six - ton laser module must be maintained and refuelled with hazardous toxic chemicals .
Just how many shots the ATL can fire before being rearmed is unclear , but hints dropped by Pentagon sources suggest it could be as few as six .
This compares poorly with the firepower available aboard a normal AC - 130 , leading some analysts to wonder what the point of the ATL really is .
Boeing say that it will offer " ultra - precision " and " dramatically reduce collateral damage " , though so far nothing of this sort has really been shown .
A 40 mm cannon aboard a normal AC - 130 could " defeat " a stationary ground vehicle without damaging its surroundings : a .50 - cal sniper rifle fired from a helicopter could do the same to a moving one .
It has n't escaped notice , however , that neither of those things could strike silently - perhaps from so far off that the carrying aircraft would n't be noticed either - and without leaving any solid evidence of US military presence .
Nor have observers failed to note that the US military agency in charge of ATL is the secretive Special Operations Command ( SOCOM ) .
Boeing have evidently had some problems with the ATL - airborne test firings were expected last year , but this success did n't happen until last Sunday .
However it would seem that the system may soon be as ready for frontline use as it will ever be , at least until electric lasers without fuel limitations are weaponised .
In years to come , the secret supertroopers of SOCOM may be able to cause a cell tower to stop working , a vehicle 's fuel tank to suddenly explode , or a single person to inexplicably be incinerated - all completely silently and tracelessly , without anyone knowing they were ever there and not so much as a spent bullet left behind . ®
Earlier today the ASP.
NET team launched a new Microsoft Ajax CDN ( Content Delivery Network ) service that provides caching support for AJAX libraries ( including jQuery and ASP.
NET AJAX ) .
The service is available for free , does not require any registration , and can be used for both commercial and non-commercial purposes .
What does a CDN provide ?
Content delivery networks ( CDNs ) are composed of " edge cache " servers that are strategically placed around the world at key Internet network points .
These " edge cache " servers can be used to cache and deliver all types of content – including images , videos , CSS and JavaScript files .
Using a CDN can significantly improve a website 's end - user performance , since it enables browsers to more quickly retrieve and download content .
For example , instead of having a browser request for an image traverse all the way across the Internet to your web server to download , a CDN can instead serve the request directly from a nearby " edge cache " server that might only be a single network hop away from your customer ( making it return much faster – which makes your pages load quicker ) .
What does the Microsoft AJAX CDN provide ?
The Microsoft AJAX CDN makes it really easy to add the jQuery and ASP .
NET AJAX script libraries to your web sites , and have them be automatically served from one of our thousands of geo-located edge - cache servers around the world .
For example , if you want to use jQuery from the Microsoft AJAX CDN then you can simply add a standard script tag to your page using the URL below :
< script src= " http://ajax.microsoft.com/ajax/jquery/jquery-1.3.2.min.js " type =" text / javascript " ></ script >
When the browser requests the script file it will be automatically served by the CDN " edge cache " server that is closest to the end -user .
This means :
The request will be processed much faster than if it had to hit your web - server ( making the end - user 's page load much faster )
You do n't have to pay for the bandwidth of this file – since the file comes from our server we pay the bandwidth cost ( saving you money )
The script can be easily cached across multiple web - sites – which means it might not even need to be downloaded if the user has already hit a web - site that requested the file ( and as such has it already in the browser 's cache ) .
You can get a full listing of the JavaScript libraries ( and associated URLs ) we already have loaded in our CDN cache here : www.asp.net/ajax/cdn
We 'll update the available libraries in the CDN as we ship new versions of ASP .
NET AJAX , and continue to update it to include all of the JavaScript files we ship with ASP.
NET and Visual Studio ( including jQuery , the jQuery Validation plugin , and additional libraries we ship in the future ) .
The CDN service is free and available for anyone in the community to use for both commercial and non-commercial purposes .
You do not need to register to take advantage of it .
Using the Microsoft AJAX CDN with the ASP.
NET 4.0 ScriptManager
In addition to allowing you to reference script files directly using a < script > element , ASP .
NET 4.0 will make it easy to use the CDN from ASP .
NET Web Forms applications that use the < asp: scriptmanager /> server control .
The ASP .
NET 4.0 < asp : ScriptManager > control includes a new property named EnableCdn .
When you assign the value true to this property , your application will use the Microsoft CDN to request JavaScript files automatically :
When you enable the CDN with the ScriptManager , your application will retrieve all JavaScript files that it normally retrieves from the System .
Web.dll or System .
Web.Extensions.dll assemblies from the CDN instead .
This includes both the JavaScript files within ASP .
NET AJAX , as well as the built - in Web Forms JavaScript files ( for example : the WebUIValidation.js file for client - side validation , and the JavaScript files for controls like TreeView , Menu , etc ) .
This provides a nice end - user performance improvement , and means that users accessing your ASP.
NET website wo n’t need to re-download these files if they have visited another ASP .
NET website that uses the CDN .
Using ASP.NET AJAX Preview 5 from the CDN
In addition to launching the AJAX CDN site , the ASP.
NET team has also recently released ASP .
NET AJAX Preview 5 .
You can download ASP .
NET AJAX Preview 5 ( with sample code ) from CodePlex : http://aspnet.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=32770
You can also now use the ASP .
NET AJAX libraries simply by adding the following script tags that point at the CDN :
< script src= " http://ajax.microsoft.com/ajax/beta/0909/MicrosoftAjax.js " type =" text / javascript " ></ script >
< script src= " http://ajax.microsoft.com/ajax/beta/0909/MicrosoftAjaxTemplates.js " type =" text / javascript " ></ script >
These script tags reference the beta version of the September 2009 release of the ASP .
NET AJAX library ( the /0909 / part of the URL represents the year and month that the version of ASP.
NET AJAX was released ) .
After you add script tags that reference the ASP .
NET AJAX library , you can start using the library in your page .
For example , the following code attaches a client DataView control that represents an array of photos to a DIV element in the body of the page .
The DIV element – with an id of " photos " – contains a template for formatting each photo in the array of photos .
Here ’s how the photos element is declared :
When the DataView is rendered , the contents of the photos DIV element is rendered for each photo in the array of photos .
The following photos are displayed :
Because ASP.NET AJAX is a pure JavaScript library , the code above works perfectly well in an ASP .
NET Web Forms , ASP.
NET MVC , HTML , or even with classic Active Server Pages .
The code also works with all modern browsers .
You can learn more about ASP .
NET AJAX Preview 5 by downloading the sample code from the CodePlex project : http://aspnet.codeplex.com/Release/ProjectReleases.aspx?ReleaseId=32770
Below are several blog posts that delve into the features of ASP .
NET AJAX Preview 5 in more depth :

ASP.NET Ajax Preview 5 and UpdatePanel – Jim Wang explains how you can use Preview 5 with existing websites that use the standard ASP .
NET UpdatePanel control .
Building a class browser with Microsoft Ajax 4.0 Preview 5 – Bertrand Le Roy builds a very cool Ajax class browser application by taking advantage of several new features of Preview 5 including recursive templates .
How the DataContext can change your data and your life ( well , sort of , but not really ) – Jonathan Carter has a great series of posts that dive into the details of the Ajax DataView and DataContext .
Summary
The Microsoft Ajax CDN enables you to significantly improve the performance of ASP .
NET Web Forms and ASP.
NET MVC applications that use ASP.
NET AJAX or jQuery .
The service is available for free , does not require any registration , and can be used for both commercial and non-commercial purposes .
ASP .NET 4.0 will make it especially easy for ASP .
NET Web Forms developers to take advantage of the CDN .
By setting one property of the ScriptManager control , you will be able to redirect all requests for the built - in ASP .
NET JavaScript files to the CDN and improve the performance of your Web Forms applications .
Hope this helps ,

Introduction to unittest
Starting Testing with Python
Note In Python 2.7 and 3.2 a whole bunch of improvements to unittest will arrive .
The major changes include new assert methods , clean up functions , assertRaises as a context manager , new command line features , test discovery and the load_tests protocol .
unittest2 is a backport of the new features ( and tests ) to work with Python 2.4 , 2.5 & 2.6 .
See : unittest2 : improvements to the unittest module
Introduction
As a dynamic language Python is substantially easier to test than other languages , which means that there is absolutely no excuse for not having good tests for your Python projects .
This article is about testing in Python , mainly using the Python standard library testing framework unittest .
Testing is an important subject in the Python world and there are a huge number of different testing libraries and tools available .
You can find a good collection of some of the popular libraries in the Python Testing Tool Taxonomy .
Testing
There are many different ways of categorizing tests , and many names for subtly different styles of testing .
Broadly speaking , the three categories of tests are as follow : Unit tests
Functional tests ( black box tests , acceptance tests , integration tests )
Regression tests
Unit tests are for testing components of your code , usually individual classes or functions .
The elements under test should be testable in isolation from other parts , which means eliminating dependencies .
It is n't always obvious how to do this , but there are ways of handling these dependencies within your tests .
Dependencies that particularly need to be managed include cases where your tests need to access external resources like databases or the filesystem .
As well as looking at the basics of setting up a test framework we 'll also be looking at some of the techniques you can use to control dependencies ( mock objects ) .
Functional tests are higher - level tests that drive your application from the outside .
This can be done with automation tools , by your test framework , or by providing hooks within your application .
Functional tests mimic user actions and test that specific input produces the right output .
As well as testing the individual units of code that the tests exercise , they also check that all the parts are wired together correctly - something that unit testing alone does n’t achieve .
For some ideas about functional testing techniques with Python see my article Functional Testing of GUI Applications .
Regression testing checks that bugs you ’ve fixed do n’t recur .
Regression tests are basically unit tests , but your motivation for writing them is different .
Once you ’ve identified and fixed a bug , the regression test guarantees that it does n’t come back .
The easiest way to start with testing in Python is to use the standard library module unittest .
The unittest Module unittest has its origins in the Java testing framework JUnit , which itself was a port of the Smalltalk testing framework SUnit created by Kent Beck .
As it is part of the xUnit family unittest is sometimes known as pyUnit .
unittest is an object oriented framework based around test fixtures .
In unittest the test fixture is the TestCase class , and its basic usage is very simple : import unittest class MyTest ( unittest .
TestCase ) : def testMethod ( self ) : self .
assertEqual ( 1 + 2 , 3 , " 1 + 2 not equal to 3 " ) if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : unittest . main ()
You create a new test fixture by subclassing TestCase and defining test methods whose names start with test .
The test methods perform actions with your production classes and call assert methods to verify the expected behavior and results .
In large test frameworks it is common to subclass TestCase and provide methods useful for testing your specific project .
Your test modules will then subclass your custom test fixture rather than directly inheriting from unittest .
TestCase .
The block at the end of the example above calls unittest. main ( ) when the test module is executed directly from the command line : python test_something .
py
This executes all the tests in the test module reporting failures and errors .
Test passes are shown as a '.' , failures with an ' F ' and errors with an ' E ' .
To run a test suite consisting of several test modules they must be collected before they can be run .
Loaders , runners and all that stuff
There are a whole bunch of other classes in unittest ; test runners , test loaders , test suites , test results and all that stuff .
My book IronPython in Action has a more detailed description of how they wire together .
Code to execute tests in multiple test modules might look like this : import unittest import test_something import test_something2 import test_something3 loader = unittest .
TestLoader ( ) suite = loader .
loadTestsFromModule ( test_something ) suite .
addTests ( loader .
loadTestsFromModule ( test_something2 ) ) suite .
addTests ( loader .
loadTestsFromModule ( test_something3 ) ) runner = unittest .
TextTestRunner ( verbosity = 2 ) result = runner .
run ( suite )
The code above imports all the test modules separately ( test_something , test_something2 ... ) and turns them into a test suite before executing them with a runner .
The image below shows the interactions between the classes .
All of these classes can be subclassed to customize their behavior .
Fortunately there is also a simpler way of collecting and running all the tests in a project .
Automatic test discovery
An easier way of running all the tests in a project is to use automatic test discovery .
This is a feature that has been in alternative Python testing frameworks , such as nose and py.test , for a long time .
Test discovery has finally been added to unittest in what will become Python 2.7 and Python 3.2 .
The test discovery has been backported as a separate module that can be used with Python 2.4 or more recent , including IronPython .
The discover module : automatic test discovery for unittest
When you run discover .py from the command line it searches from the current directory , recursing into Python packages that it finds , running all the test modules that it is able to import .
The basic way of running test discovery is from the command line with the current directory at the top level of the project : python discover .py
Or if the discover module is on your default module path ( either in a directory pointed to by the PYTHONPATH environment variable or a directory added to the path by site . py ) then you can execute it with : python -m discover discover identifies test modules as importable files ( inside a Python package ) matching the pattern ' test *.py ' .
You can configure the pattern , and options like the directory discover starts its search in , with command line parameters : > python -m discover -h Usage : discover .py [ options ]
Options : -h , -- help show this help message and exit -v , --verbose Verbose output -s START , --start-directory =START
Directory to start discovery ( '.' default ) -p PATTERN , --pattern=PATTERN
Pattern to match tests ( ' test*. py ' default ) -t TOP , --top- level - directory=TOP
Top level directory of project ( defaults to start directory )
If you want to build a more complex test framework , perhaps with a custom test runner that pushes results to a database , you can still use discovery by importing and using the DiscoveringTestLoader which is a subclass of the standard unittest TestLoader .
The assert methods
We 've looked at some of the plumbing behind creating a test framework for a project , let 's look at the different assert methods available on the TestCase class .
These methods allow you to make different kinds of assertions about the behaviour of your objects .
The four most common assert methods come in two pairs , with a positive and a negative variant : assertTrue and assertFalse , assertEqual and assertNotEqual .
import unittest from mymodule import MyClass class MyTest ( unittest .
TestCase ) : def testTrue ( self ) : myclass = MyClass ( ) try : result = myclass .
method ( ) self .
asssertTrue ( result ) finally : myclass .
close ( ) def testFalse ( self ) : myclass = MyClass ( ) try : result = myclass .
anotherMethod ( ) self .
asssertFalse ( result ) finally : myclass .
close ( ) def testEqual ( self ) : myclass = MyClass ( ) try : first = myclass .
methodOne ( ) second = myclass .
methodTwo ( ) self .
assertEqual ( first , second ) finally : myclass .
close ( ) def testNotEqual ( self ) : myclass = MyClass ( ) try : first = myclass .
methodOne ( ) third = myclass .
methodThree ( ) self .
assertNotEqual ( first , third ) finally : myclass .
close ()
These methods should all be self - explanatory .
They provide the basic building block for you to build your test infrastructure on .
In addition to these four asserts there are three additional ones .
The first two of these are assertAlmostEqual and assertNotAlmostEqual for comparing floats .
You specify the number of decimal places to compare them to : first = 3.1 second = 3.2 # this will pass self .
assertAlmostEqual ( first , second , 0 ) # this will fail self .
assertAlmostEqual ( first , second , 1 ) In practise I do n't find number of decimal places to be a fine enough granularity for comparison .
Inevitably when comparing floats I actually compare against a delta : first = 3.1 second = 3.2 delta = 0.2 difference = abs ( first - second ) self .
assertTrue ( difference < delta , " difference : %s is not less than %s " % ( difference , delta ) )
The final assert method is a bit more useful .
Often when testing an API you need to test how it behaves under error conditions , for example you may want to test that given invalid input a method raises a specific type of exception .
The assertRaises method is how we test for this .
It takes an exception type as the first argument , followed by a callable ( usually a function ) along with any arguments it takes .
The assert methods calls the function and the assert passes if an exception of the correct type is raised .
If an exception is not raised the assert fails and if an non-matching exception is raised then it is not caught and the test fails with an error .
def adder ( a , b ) : return a + b self .
assertRaises ( TypeError , adder , 33 , ' a string ' )
In the version of unittest that will be in Python 2.7 / 3.2 several new and useful assert methods have been added .
The Python documentation for these versions has the details .
The assert statement unittest assertions are based on the Python assert statement .
The assert statement takes an expression and raises an AssertionError if the expression evaluates to False .
The assert in one of the examples from above could be written as : assert 1 + 2 == 3 , " 1 + 2 not equal to 3 " There are two reasons we use assert methods rather than plain asserts in our tests .
The assert will fail if the expression evaluates to False , but the only error message we get is the message we provide to the assert statement : >>> assert a == b , " a != b " Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... AssertionError : a != b
If we use the assert methods then the failure message can include more useful information , especially about the objects being compared .
The second reason to use assert methods is that assert statements are disabled ( not executed ) when Python is run with the - O or - OO command line arguments ( optimized mode ) .
assert statements can be used to verify conditions in your code ; runtime design by contract .
setUp and tearDown I 'm sure you noticed that in the earlier examples all the test methods had some code in common .
They both instantiated MyClass and closed the instance when the test completed .
This not only violates DRY ( Do n't Repeat Yourself ) but is tedious and error prone ( bad things may happen if you forget to close the instance ) .
Those of you used to testing frameworks in other languages will not be surprised to hear that unittest has methods called setUp and tearDown to deal with these situations .
If your test cases define a setUp method it will be called before every test .
If there is an exception raised in the setUp then the appropriate error or failure will be recorded and the test method will not be run .
setUp is particularly useful for functional / integration tests where setting up fixtures means establishing a lot of state .
In the case of our earlier tests we can rewrite using setUp : import unittest from mymodule import MyClass class MyTest ( unittest .
TestCase ) : def setUp ( self ) : unittest .
TestCase .
setUp ( self ) self .
myclass = MyClass ( ) def testTrue ( self ) : try : result = self .
myclass .
method ( ) self .
asssertTrue ( result ) finally : myclass . close ( ) ...
In set Up here MyClass is instantiated and stored as an instance variable on the TestCase instance .
The test can access the instance created by setUp instead of having to create it itself .
The setUp method in TestCase does nothing ( at least in the current versions of unittest ) so strictly speaking it is n't necessary to call up to the parent class .
When you inherit from a custom TestCase you will need to call up to the parent method so it is a good habit to get into .
setUp has a corresponding method that is called after the test has run , tearDown .
Like setUp , if an exception is raised in tearDown then the appropriate error or failure will be recorded for the test .
Currently our tests still have to close the MyClass instance after use , we can use tearDown to fix this : import unittest from mymodule import MyClass class MyTest ( unittest .
TestCase ) : def setUp ( self ) : unittest .
TestCase .
setUp ( self ) self .
myclass = MyClass ( ) def tearDown ( self ) : unittest .
TestCase .
tearDown ( self ) self .
myclass .
close ( ) def testTrue ( self ) : result = self .
myclass .
method ( ) self .
asssertTrue ( result ) ...
See how using tearDown also simplifies our test .
As tearDown is executed even if the test fails or an error occurs we no longer need to use a try : ... finally : to ensure the MyClass instance is closed .
We 've now covered the major points of working with unittest itself , let 's look at some general Python testing techniques .
Duck typing and mock objects
One of the reasons that Python is so much easier to test than statically typed languages is that because of the wonders of duck typing we can substitute any object at runtime for another object that supports the same operations .
This means we can swap out production classes with mock objects that record how they are used .
Let 's look at how we might test this code in Python : class MyClass ( object ) : def __init__ ( self ) : self .
data =
None def readData ( self , source ) : self .
data = source .
read ( ) source .
close ()
MyClass has a readData method that takes a data source , reads from it and then closes it .
A real data source may be expensive ( slow ) to create , and in any case we want to test MyClass in isolation .
We can create a mock data source that has the methods MyClass uses .
Our tests can use the mock data source so that we can check MyClass uses it as it should .
This is especially useful when using a real data source may be slow or uses an external resource like a database : class MockDataSource ( object ) : def __init__ ( self ) : self .
readFrom =
False self .
closed =
False def read ( self ) : self .
readFrom =
True return ' some data ' def close ( self ) : self .
closed =
True
The read method of our mock data source returns some known data when called .
It also records that it has been read from , by setting readFrom to True , and when close has been called .
Using the MockDataSource to test MyClass : import unittest from mymodule import MyClass def TestMyClass ( unittest .
TestCase ) : def testConstructor ( self ) : " Test the default state " myclass = MyClass ( ) self .
assertEqual ( myclass .
data , None ) def testReadData ( self ) : myclass = MyClass ( ) source = MockDataSource ( ) myclass .
readData ( source ) self .
assertEqual ( myclass . data , ' some data ' ) self .
assertTrue ( source .
readFrom ) self .
assertTrue ( source .
closed )
Constructing custom mocks for all the production classes you need to test can be time consuming and painful .
Fortunately we can make this easier by using one of the many Python mocking libraries that are available .
My favourite is mock , which by coincidence I wrote and is particularly suited for use with unittest .
The main class in the mock library is Mock .
Mock automatically creates methods and attributes as they are accessed and records how they are used .
Mock instances have several useful methods and attributes to control their behavior and make assertions about how they have been used .
We can rewrite our test above to use Mock : import unittest from mock import Mock from mymodule import MyClass def TestMyClass ( unittest .
TestCase ) : def testConstructor ( self ) : " Test the default state " myclass = MyClass ( ) self .
assertEqual ( myclass .
data , None ) def testReadData ( self ) : myclass = MyClass ( ) source = Mock ( ) source .
read .
return_value = ' some data ' myclass .
readData ( source ) self .
assertEqual ( myclass . data , ' some data ' ) self .
assertTrue ( source .
read .
called ) self .
assertTrue ( source .
close .
called )
The line source .
read.
return_value = ' some data ' automatically creates the read method on our mock data source merely by accessing it and then sets the return_value to be ' some data ' .
The newly created read method is actually a new Mock instance .
As Mock instances are callable they can behave just like methods of objects .
Setting the return_value controls what is returned when the mock is called .
If the mock is called with arguments you can use the assert_called _with method to verify that it has been called with the expected arguments .
A quick run down of some of the useful members on Mock objects : >>> from mock import Mock >>> mock = Mock ( ) >>> mock .
method .
return_value = ' foo ' >>> >>> mock .
method ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) ' foo ' >>> mock .
method .
called True >>> mock .
method .
assert_called_with ( 8 , 6 ) Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... AssertionError : Expected : ( ( 8 , 6 ) , {} ) Called with : ( ( 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 ) , {} ) >>>
Mock objects can even raise exception or have other side effects when called : >>> mock = Mock ( ) >>> mock .
side_effect = Exception ( ' Boom ! ' ) >>> mock ()
Traceback ( most recent call last ) : ... Exception : Boom ! >>> results = [ 1 , 2 , 3 ] >>> def side_effect ( * args , ** kwargs ) : ... return results . pop ( ) ... >>> mock .
side_effect = side_effect >>> mock ( ) , mock ( ) , mock ( ) ( 3 , 2 , 1 ) There 's lots more to mock so it is worth perusing the documentation .
As well as the Mock class it has useful decorators for automatic monkey patching , which is another powerful testing technique .
Monkey patching Monkey patching is a term that originated in the Python community to describe runtime modification ( patching ) of live objects .
This can include replacing methods with a completely new implementation .
This is generally regarded as being a bad thing to do in production code but is very useful for testing .
Note Monkey patching is a term that started with the Python community but is now widely used ( especially within the Ruby community ) .
It seems to have originated with Zope programmers , who referred to guerilla patching .
This evolved from gorilla patching into monkey patching .
We can illustrate this with some new methods on MyClass .
class MyClass ( object ) : def __init__ ( self ) : self .
data =
None def readData ( self , source ) : self .
data = source .
read ( ) source .
close ( ) def synchronise ( self ) : source = self .
getDataSource ( ) self .
readData ( source ) self .
store ()
The new method synchronise on MyClass fetches a data source , reads the data and then stores it .
synchronise calls readData , which we have already worked with , and getDataSource and store which for convenience are n't shown .
We can test the synchronise method in isolation by monkey patching the three methods that it uses .
Note In Python we can patch classes as well as instances .
If we patch an instance then the changes only affect that instance but changes to classes persist .
If you patch a class in a test then you have to be very careful to restore the class to its original state or your changes will ' leak ' and could affect future tests .
We can reuse the Mock class we have been working with to replace the methods that synchronise calls .
import unittest from mock import Mock , sentinel from mymodule import MyClass def TestMyClass ( unittest .
TestCase ) : def testSynchronise ( self ) : myclass = MyClass ( ) # put the monkey patching in place myclass .
getDataSource = Mock ( ) myclass .
getDataSource .
return_value = sentinel .
DataSource myclass .
readData = Mock ( ) myclass .
store = Mock ( ) # make the call myclass .
synchronise ( ) # assertions self .
assertTrue ( myclass .
getDataSource .
called ) myclass .
readData .
assert_called_with ( sentinel .
DataSource ) self .
assertTrue ( myclass .
store .
called )
As well as Mock this test uses another object provided by the mock module .
sentinel is another object that creates attributes on demand .
Every time you access the same attribute it returns the same object , so we can use sentinel to provide known values for our tests .
It makes for nice readable tests when we should need some value that we can test against .
In this test we check that readData is called with the return value of getDataSource , sentinel .
DataSource .
That method was easy to test , but methods that use external classes can be harder to test .
With Python as well as patching instances we can patch objects at the module level .
Because name lookup is done at runtime we can replace the implementation of an external class with another mock object .
As with directly patching classes any changes you make to modules will persist so you have to be extremely careful about undoing any changes you make .
The mock module has decorators for tests that can handle doing the patching and automatically undoing it once the test has completed .
Let 's have a look at a potential implementation for the getDataSource method that synchronise calls .
from datasource import DataSource class MyClass ( object ) : def getDataSource ( self ) : return DataSource ()
It 's a trivial piece of code but it could be very hard to test , especially if creating the DataSource is expensive or connects to external resources that may not be available in a test environment .
We can test it by patching out the DataSource name in mymodule .
When getDataSource is called the DataSource name will be looked up in the module namespace .
If we have replaced it with an alternative implementation then that will be used instead .
It is important to realise that we are patching the namespace where DataSource is used , which in our case is mymodule , and not patching the place where DataSource is defined .
The mock module provides a patch decorator that will do the patching for us , and as an added bonus it will patch it with a Mock object and pass the mock into our test method .
Here is a simple test for getDataSource using the patch decorator , the mock created by the patch decorator is the extra parameter ( MockDataSource ) to the testSynchronise method : import unittest from mock import Mock , patch , sentinel from mymodule import MyClass class TestMyClass ( unittest .
TestCase ) : @patch ( ' mymodule.DataSource ' ) def testSychronise ( self , MockDataSource ) : MockDataSource .
return_value = sentinel .
DataSource myclass = MyClass ( ) source = myclass .
getDataSource ( ) self .
assertEquals ( source , sentinel .
DataSource )
Instantiating a class is done by calling it ( instantiation is actually done by the __call__ method of the class 's metaclass - so instantiation is calling the class ) .
As DataSource is instantiated inside the getDataSource call we control what is returned by setting the return value on the MockDataSource .
getDataSource just returns the instance it creates , so we test that the return value of calling this method is the same object we set as the MockDataSource return value .
But there ’s a potential problem with over using monkey patching .
Your tests become whitebox tests that know a great deal about the implementation of the objects under test .
A pattern that can help reduce this coupling is dependency injection .
Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles , good stuff .
Who did n't laugh every time Dean brought them up in reference to Raphael ?
With Dean and Sam apart , there was two fairly separate stories that only made me want to see how they will come together in the end .
For now , we 'll have Dean and Cas with Sam doing his own thing .
Sam 's story was predictable other than the major twist in the end .
Sam is now working at a bar .
He keeps to himself , but calls Bobby after seeing weird weather .
Some hunters roll in town , learn about Sam 's demon fetish , fight him , and leave .
The big story was Jess 's appearance in the beginning telling him that he can't change .
At the end , we learn that it is actually Lucifer who tells him Sam is his vessel .
Oh noes !
I had this hilarious image in my mind of Michael and Lucifer picking up Dean and Sam and using them as clubs .
The specter of Lucifer looming , there was even worse news .
Castiel and Dean track down the Archangel Raphael in the hunt for God.
Raphael tells them that God is dead and when Cas questions how he came back , there was a simple answer : Lucifer .
I never thought of that before , because all Lucifer is just a glorified ( or fallen ) angel .
How could he revive another angel ?
There seems to be a lot of blame going on and it's all directed at God .
The angels hate him for elevating humans above them and everyone else hates God because he 's not doing anything .
Part of Lucifer / Jess telling Sam he can't change is to get Sam to blame God .
If it 's Sam nature to be like this , then it 's God 's fault .
Lucifer and Raphael can't blame themselves for what they do .
The thing is , maybe they have a point .
God abandoned everyone , angels , demons , and humans alike and now there 's nothing to control anything .
Whatever happens from here is really in the hands of nobody .
There were plenty of good moments with Castiel and his one - liners .
If found the getting laid part a little too strange , but that 's part of the show .
Dean teaching Cas things could get old fast so I hope Dean is n't tagging along with Castiel every episode .
I like last season how Castiel would just pop up which made angels seem more mysterious .
Now we 're starting to understand Castiel .
He 's like the good child , always doing good and hoping dad will reciprocate , but this time , dad is nowhere to be found .
I commented on another site : I think Raphael could be justified in what he is doing or not doing ( letting demons overrun everything ) .
God is gone and left control with the angels .
Unless there is a mandate given by God to the angel , they can come up with reasons for destroying humanity .
They are higher beings than humans and maybe they just want to be left alone .
We do n't know how they think or what ends they want , so I think we should see how this season plays out before casting judgment .

It sounds too good to be true : A residential system that allows people to make fuel from old beer , leftover wine and other waste products and use it to run their vehicles .
That ’s what inventors of the E - Fuel MicroFueler claim , and there ’s support for the idea in government , industry and pop culture .
MicroFueler buyers are eligible for a $ 5,000 tax credit .
Former L.A. Laker Shaquille O’Neal is an investor in the system ’s distributor .
The $ 10,000 E - Fuel MicroFueler consists of a 250 - gallon tank for organic feedstock , such as waste wine and beer , and a still that converts it to pure ethanol , or E - Fuel .
The still doubles as a fuel pump , which works similarly to those at gas stations .
The only waste product is distilled water .
“ If we give everybody the ability to make their own fuel , you break the oil infrastructure , ” said MicroFueler inventor Tom Quinn , a Silicon Valley entrepreneur who also developed the motion - control system for the Nintendo Wii gaming system , a version of which is used in his new micro-refinery .

“ Three years ago , I looked at where the world was going , and energy caught my eye , ” said Quinn , chief executive of E - Fuel Corp. in Los Gatos .
“ As a world , we had no replacement fuel for gasoline , and that led me to alternative fuels such as ethanol . ”
The problem with ethanol , Quinn said , was energy inefficiency -- not only in the carbon cost of growing , harvesting and transporting the corn that was used to make it , but also in the distillation process that turned it into usable fuel .
Many environmentalists are critical of corn - based ethanol , saying it is an inefficient fuel that uses valuable cropland and increases food prices .
“ In the U.S. alone , more than 100 billion gallons of organic fuel is thrown out , ” said Quinn , who reached out to ethanol scientist Floyd Butterfield to see if they could collaborate on a system that could make ethanol in a manner that was cost effective and better for the environment .
The idea was to use organic waste rather than corn to make a product known as cellulosic ethanol .

Although Quinn ’s MicroFueler is most effective with wastes that are high in alcohol , ethanol “ can be made out of any waste -- lawn clippings , dairy products , old chemicals , cardboard , paper , bruised and discarded apples from the grocery store .
It can be fermented and turned into fuel in minutes , ” Quinn said .
So far , only one MicroFueler is up and running .
It was installed in late June at the Pacific Palisades home of Chris Ursitti , CEO of GreenHouse International Inc. , the San Diego firm that is distributing the units and supplying feedstock to those who install MicroFuelers at their homes .
“ You just open up the hatch and pour in some waste and it turns it into fuel for the car , ” said Ursitti , who ’s been using homemade ethanol to run his flex - fuel - converted Lexus hybrid SUV .
GreenHouse has contracts with Karl Strauss Brewing Co. , Gordon Biersch Brewing Co. and Sunny Delight Beverages Co. to convert 29,000 tons of their liquid waste using MicroFuelers .
Advertisement
Though Ursitti is the only one now using the system , the plan is for a tanker truck to pick up the companies ’ waste and deliver it to home - based MicroFuelers , which convert it to ethanol on site .
MicroFueler owners are charged $ 2 a gallon once they pump out the fuel .
“ What they need , we have .
What we need , they have , ” said Karl Strauss CEO Chris Cramer , referring to his San Diego company ’s symbiotic relationship with GreenHouse , for which no money is changing hands .
Before entering the feedstock pilot program with GreenHouse , Karl Strauss took care of all its beer - brewing waste products by paying outside companies to destroy beer that had passed its freshness date and farmers who fed the spent brewing grains to their pigs .
Now GreenHouse is using expired beer .
“ Because we ’re a fairly large craft brewer , there ’s a lot of yeast , a lot of beer going around , ” Cramer said .
“ Any drops of beer that do n’t go into a bottle , we ’d like to make ethanol and fuel vehicles . ”

Converting expired beer and other liquid wastes into cellulosic ethanol takes minutes and uses three kilowatt - hours of electricity to produce one gallon of fuel .
In addition to powering vehicles , the fuel could run a “ gridbuster , ” or home generator , which produces 23 kilowatt - hours of electricity per gallon , GreenHouse said .
Factoring in the $ 5,000 federal tax credit , an annual household fuel consumption of 2,080 gallons and a $ 2 charge a gallon , GreenHouse estimates the average consumer payback time is about two years .
Ethanol has less fuel value than gasoline , meaning a car will travel fewer miles on a gallon of ethanol than on a gallon of gasoline .
But it also creates 38 % less carbon dioxide than gasoline when burned , according to Quinn .

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency “ has not been called upon to analyze the environmental impacts of [ organic ethanol ] in comparison to gasoline , ” EPA spokeswoman Cathy Milbourn said .
However , she said , “ using waste products derived from renewable sources . . . would likely lead to an overall smaller carbon footprint in comparison to a food - based feedstock ” such as corn .
It ’s legal to make up to 10,000 gallons a year of alcohol fuel , such as ethanol , on one ’s own property as long as it is n’t sold to others .
An alcohol fuel producer ’s permit from the U.S. Alcohol and Tobacco Tax and Trade Bureau is required .

ShopTo has empathised with European retailers boycotting PSPgo , and reckons the format " is almost dead before it has arrived " .
Analyst Michael Pachter , on the other hand , thinks they 're all being " foolish " , and calls the entire situation " ridiculous " .
" It 's just silly for a retailer to say that they wo n't sell a big ticket gaming device because they can't sell the games .
Consumer electronics stores sell refrigerators and not food , everyone sells iPods and not the music for them ; this position is just ridiculous , " Michael Pachter , analyst for investor Wedbush Morgan Securities , told Eurogamer .
" I think that it 's foolish for a retailer to be selective about what they carry , unless they truly do n't believe it will sell well . "
A much better course of action , he argued , would be to buy limited stock and then re-order if appropriate .
" Refusing to carry them subjects them to the risk that Sony will bypass them for Gran Turismo or Uncharted , in which case they lose , " he said .
The ball began rolling when Dutch outlet Nedgame publicly opposed the PSPgo for being too expensive and for not featuring a UMD drive , thus providing no opportunity to sell games .
And controlling all sales via PSN gives Sony a " monopoly " on software sales , argued the shop .
Media Markt , a German retail chain that spans Europe , took up a similar position , with Spanish and Italian ( and no doubt other regions ) outlets prohibited from selling the device .
ShopTo will not follow suit , but agrees with the sentiment .
" We do have it listed on the site , but we are not concentrating any big marketing behind it , " boss Igor Cipolletta told Eurogamer .
" Sony has decided to cut publishers and retailers for the software of the PSPgo and deal direct with developers , giving them a 70 per cent margin for any items sold on Sony PSN .
I believe if they had lowered that to 50 or 60 per cent , and given the opportunity to online retailers , it would have enjoyed greater success and retailers would attempt to promote the console to the market . "
Cipolletta , however , feels the damage may have already been done , and the format - which launches here on 1st October for £ 224.99 ( 249.99 ) - will be a flop .
" I have the feeling that as a format it is almost dead before it has arrived , and it relies far too heavily on a customer base that is prepared to pay more for download content than the equivalent disc based product , and I suspect this market will soon dry up based on the technical limitations of the hardware , " Cipolletta shared .
But , Pachter added , while retailers wield " some power " now , their foot - stamping wo n't be entertained for long .
" As far as the argument that ' it 's about time ' retailers received their comeuppance : I think that will occur soon enough anyway , as the large hard drives in the PS3 and 360 ( and the larger ones coming ) will encourage a greater number of downloads in the future , " he offered .
" Retailers have to face the fact that games will be increasingly offered over Xbox Live and PlayStation Network , and cope with the outcome .
" To draw a line in the sand , " Pachter said , " is wrong . "
Sony , incidentally , has not responded comment on the matter .
Not Even Close
I ca n’t even think up of a rationale someone would give themselves before leaving the house with those on !
Even if it was 3 a.m. and you were going to a remote cave in the mountains by yourself you would probably say , “ These are n’t flattering at all , I ’ll change . ”

Deputy Tasers Mom In Mini-van
Audra Harmon had two children in her minivan when she was pulled over for speeding and talking on her cell phone in Salina , a northern suburb of Syracuse , NY , in January .
While she denies both those charges , a dashboard camera from Onondaga County Sheriff 's Deputy Sean Andrews ' cruiser captured a video of the officer using his Taser twice on the 38 - year - old mom .
This has not been a good year for public safety forces across the U.S. when it comes to police brutality .
Low - cost digital video cameras , combined with the availability of upload sites like YouTube and link - sharing sites like Reddit , have made it easier for people to share videos of alleged police brutality and violence in action .
On New Year 's Day 2009 , people in a Bay Area Regional Transit ( BART ) station in Oakland , CA , captured video of police fatally shooting Oscar Grant .
Several angles of the shooting have made it to YouTube .
Warning :
This video contains adult language , and , again , this was a fatal shooting caught on camera .
Watch the video »
Earlier this year , officers in Tennessee were accused of letting a police dog attack a man who had already been subdued .
The officers were also accused of planting a bag of marijuana on the man after video of the incident surfaced .
The details are still emerging after an incident at a parade in the small town of Glenrock , WY , during which a 76 - year - old man who was helping a nine - year - old boy drive a tractor was hit with a police Taser .
After the man was hit , the tractor hit a car .
Just this week , at least three more stories have emerged from around the country .
An internal investigation in Mobile , AL , found that police were justified in using a Taser on a deaf man with a mental disability .
Video of an elderly woman being thrown to the ground by police in a Wal - Mart parking lot hit YouTube Monday ( adult language in the video ) .
And in Kalamazoo , MI , a police officer was suspended after punching a youth who spit in his face ( more adult language ) .

Republicans amplify criticism of 9/11 commission
Sessions calls on Gorelick to step down
From Ed Henry
CNN Washington Bureau
WASHINGTON ( CNN ) -- With President Bush and Vice President Dick Cheney set to appear in private before the 9/11 commission next week , Republicans are ramping up their criticism of the panel -- and Democratic member Jamie Gorelick in particular .
Sen . Jeff Sessions , R - Alabama , called on Gorelick to resign , becoming the first senator to do so .
He told CNN that such a move would help the commission salvage its credibility .
" We have a little bit of a problem now with confidence in that commission , " said Sessions .
" For her to continue to play a key role in it when she herself really should be one of the people being reviewed is difficult for me to swallow . "
A Republican chairman of the House Judiciary Committee has previously called on Gorelick to step aside , a demand that was rejected as " silly " by Thomas Kean , the Republican chairman of the 9/11 commission .
Sessions ' comment comes in the wake of a letter sent by 11 other Republican senators to the commission , urging it to compel Gorelick to testify before the panel .
( Full story )
Republicans point to a memo Gorelick wrote as a top official in the Clinton Justice Department , which critics charge put a firewall between law enforcement and intelligence agents and made it harder for them to share information and thwart terrorism .
That policy remained in place under the Bush administration , until it was changed by the Patriot Act , passed after the 9/11 attacks .
In a recent Washington Post editorial , Gorelick wrote the restrictions on intelligence sharing date back to 1978 - well before she came to Justice .
" I did not invent the ' wall , ' " she wrote .
Gorelick has previously said she will not be deterred by political pressure .
" I 'm not going to resign from the commission , " she told CNN earlier this month .
She also has the backing of Kean , who is taking heat from fellow Republicans for sticking up for her .
Commission spokesman Al Felzenberg told CNN that any member of Congress has the right to express an opinion , but " we very much hope that they would contact the commission directly and not communicate through the media . "
A separate spokesman for Gorelick told CNN Friday that " she has followed all the commission 's rules and has provided testimony on any issue the staff has requested .
She also has offered to provide any additional information , if asked . "
Behind the controversy is a big dose of election - year politics .
Democrats say Republicans are just poisoning the well because they fear the commission report will reflect badly on the president .
The Bush administration was the focus of some critical testimony and questions at a recent series of public hearings by the commission .
U.S. intelligence efforts and the work of the FBI were faulted .
( Full story )
Senate Democratic Leader Tom Daschle , D - South Dakota , said earlier this week that some Republicans " are afraid the commission will get the facts " so they are " undermining the credibility " of the panel .
But Republicans believe Democrats will pounce when the commission 's report is released on the eve of the Democratic National Convention .
" Oh , they 'll seize on the report , " said Sessions .
" They 'll find one line .
If there is one line out of 10,000 , they 'll be something to say gotcha with . "
Bush and Cheney are scheduled to answer questions from the commission in a session at the White House set for Thursday morning .
They are due to appear jointly before the full commission .
Neither man will be under oath -- unlike witnesses who have testified before the commission in public hearings .
Seventy years ago this week , British foreign policy collapsed .
Ignoring critics who wanted an alliance with Russia , Neville Chamberlain had been trying to find a modus vivendi with Germany .
Eleven months earlier , when he returned from Munich and proclaimed peace , he had been hailed and heralded .
But in the interval , his policy had foundered .
Hitler was not only set on belligerence , he had secured a pact with the Russians .
In late 1939 , there was a danger that Britain could have found itself at war with both Germany and Russia .
Suddenly , everyone agreed that appeasement had been a disaster , and most of the blame fell on Chamberlain .
Those who had cheered him now reviled him .
Few political reputations have disintegrated so completely .
Chamberlain failed .
This does not mean that he was wrong to try .
In 1938 , there was no overwhelming moral case for going to war , and certainly not in alliance with Russia .
By then , Stalin had murdered many millions of people , while Hitler was still only in the thousands .
We were right to fear Hitler more than Stalin , because Hitler was more of a threat to us .
But that was about self - preservation , not abstract morality .
It is also important to remember the sequence of events .
We did not wage war to prevent the Holocaust : if there had not been a war , there might have been no Holocaust .
Admittedly , Stalin could ravage Russia into mass - murder without a war , but in Germany , that would have been harder .
Even under the Nazis , civil society was much stronger .
It may be that the full hellishness of Hitler 's gang could only have manifested itself in the smoke and darkness of total war .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In October 1938 , military calculations were more important than moral ones , and the arguments for and against war were finely balanced .
First , it is not clear that the Russians would have been much use as Allies .
They had only a relatively short land frontier with Germany , in East Prussia – and Stalin had spent the previous few months slaughtering his general staff and officer corps .
The consequences would become apparent during his incompetent campaign against Finland and in the first catastrophic weeks after Barbarossa .
In October 1938 , we would have been justified in doubting the Russians ' offensive capabilities .
Second , the UK did not waste the months after Munich .
Rearmament gained pace , especially in the RAF , which needed all the time it could get to build up its strength .
We could not have won the Battle of Britain in the summer of 1939 .
Those who wish to rehabilitate appeasement have to address the problem of Czechoslovakia .
She had strong natural defences and factories which produced world - class artillery .
On paper , a Czech alliance was a formidable asset .
But battles are not won on paper .
Would the Czechs have fought well ?
Or is there a second undiscovered volume of The Good Soldier Schweik , in which Schweik joins the Czech army after 1918 and becomes a field marshal ?
Even if the Czechs had tried to fight up to their capabilities , their efforts would have been sabotaged by the Sudeten Germans .
In 1945 , they paid a terrible price for their disloyalty .
In 1938 , they would have displayed it .
That summarises some of the military debates .
But appeasement was not about strategy .
The men who advocated it did so because they were desperate to avoid war .
One can understand why .
The First World War had come close to destroying Europe .
There was every reason to fear that a second one would finish the job .
There was nothing ignoble about the desire to preserve peace , if at all possible .
It was not possible , and Chamberlain , a pragmatist and a rationalist , was the wrong man to cope with Hitler .
Churchill , who constantly chafed at the restraints of the rational and the pragmatic , could bring a demiurge 's imaginative range to the task of dealing with evil .
But as Graham Stewart demonstrates in his outstanding book Burying Caesar , Churchill respected Chamberlain to the end .
The rest of us should do likewise .
Gordon Brown is harder to respect , and that is his own fault .
Despite the intensity of the competition , he always manages to be his own worst enemy .
Libya is the latest example .
Whatever role the Government played in the release of Abdelbaset al - Megrahi , it had a good case , which it now finds impossible to make , because Mr Brown has been weak and shifty .
Twenty years ago , we were virtually in a state of undeclared war with Libya .
The Libyans had given a lot of help to the IRA .
They had tried to undermine Western interests wherever they could .
Margaret Thatcher had allowed American planes to bomb Tripoli from British bases .
In her memoirs , she writes that she agonised before taking that courageous decision .
She knew it would be unpopular .
It was .
It was also right , even if it encouraged the Lockerbie bombing .
That was then .
Now , everything is very different .
There has been a rapprochement .
In the course of several slow and suspicious years , the Libyans paid compensation , handed over Megrahi , renounced their nuclear programme , permitted some tourism and showed an interest in economic links with the UK .
These are all desirable developments , and not only because they will lead to higher company profits and with them , urgently needed tax revenues .
Trade and investment will help to strengthen our ties with Libya , making it less likely that there will be a reversion to the bad old days .
There will still be problems .
Colonel Gaddafi is not about to turn into Thomas Jefferson .
But we are now in a position where disagreements can be resolved through economics , diplomacy and personal contacts .
Saif Gaddafi is a bright and interesting fellow .
His friendship with Peter Mandelson should not be held against him .
There was one surviving embarrassment from the difficult years : Megrahi , in prison , dying .
Assuming that he is guilty , there were no moral grounds for clemency , but why should morality be the determining factor ?
Former IRA men serve in the Northern Ireland administration .
Senator Edward Kennedy , not too far behind the Libyans in the dishonour role of those who succoured terrorism in Ulster , is treated as if he were worthy of veneration .
Yitzhak Shamir , who was involved in the bombing of the King David hotel , went on to become prime minister of Israel .
The list could be lengthened .
There is a further point , assuming that the Libyans were responsible for Lockerbie , the decision would have been taken at the highest levels .
For the past few years , we have been happy to collaborate with those high levels .
As we have been so friendly to the organ - grinder , it is hypocrisy to make such a fuss about the monkey .
It is reasonable to regard Megrahi as a prisoner of war , who can now be sent home to die .
If the Americans object , remind them that Ted Kennedy never paid compensation .
Suppose Gordon Brown had argued along those lines .
Although he would not have commanded universal assent , he would at least have said something .
Those who disagreed might have respected his honesty .
He could even have come across as decisive .
Instead , we have been treated to a dithering , skulking silence , with the details gradually dragged out in leaks .
Ministers are acting as if they were ashamed of themselves when , for once , they have no reason to be – unless they are ashamed to be led by a prime minister who can not get anything right .
After Lily Allen sparked friction between not only thousands of people on the Internet , but also her colleagues in the Featured Artists Coalition ( FAC ) , yesterday they met up to try and forge a united front .
Now Allen has done a U - turn , stating that disconnecting pirates is too draconian and instead supports FAC calls to slow connections to a crawl .
There can hardly be a reader who has n’t read about the raging debate sparked by Lily Allen and her now - defunct anti-piracy blog / campaign .
It has been quite the hot topic this week .
Up until yesterday , Lily was one of the most prominent supporters of a proposed 3 strikes regime to deal with alleged file - sharers – crucially one which would ultimately lead to disconnection from the Internet for those accused .
However , this put her at odds with the Featured Artists Coalition ( FAC ) who felt that disconnections are too draconian .
Yesterday , despite saying that she would not attend due to a feared media scrum , Allen attended a meeting in London of around 100 musicians including representatives from FAC in order to find some common ground to move forward .
The artists took a vote and instead of backing up Allen ’s disconnection calls , went for a more palatable option – maintaining a basic level of Internet access for alleged pirates but throttling their bandwidth so that file - sharing would become impractical .
“ Our meeting voted to support a three - strike sanction on those who persistently download illegal files , to consist of a warning letter , a stronger warning letter , and a final sanction of the restriction of the infringers ’ bandwith to a level which would render file - sharing of media files impractical while leaving basic e-mail and web access functional , ” said the artists .
Lily Allen closed down her anti-piracy blog yesterday after just a few days in operation , claiming that the abuse she suffered there was too great to continue .
Nevertheless , despite the fact she has backed away , the artists said they wished to express support for her anti-piracy campaign .
“ We are trying to find a proportionate response to a real problem that is damaging our industry .
I hope it will convince the record labels that this is a way of sending a message to file - sharers , ” said Billy Bragg of FAC .
With Lily ’s crowd , the Featured Artists Coalition and also UK Music likely to support throttling instead of disconnections , there appears to be a unified voice forming from the artists .
However , while we predict that Internet users will fail to respond to threats ( even reduced ones such as throttling ) , there will be even stronger objections to the stance taken by the artists yesterday from the Big Four labels .
Having ruled out going after individual file - sharers in court , they have put all of their eggs in a single basket which relies on ISPs taking disconnection action against alleged pirates .
It is hugely unlikely that they will support these watered - down proposals but we wo n’t have to wait long to find out .
According to The Times , the labels will meet this morning and are expected to draft a letter to Lord Mandelson shortly .

Il 14 settembre scorso è stato assegnato alla Commissione Giustizia della Camera un disegno di legge a firma degli Onorevoli Pecorella e Costa attraverso il quale si manifesta l’intenzione di rendere integralmente applicabile a tutti i “ siti internet aventi natura editoriale ” l’attuale disciplina sulla stampa .
Sono bastati 101 caratteri , spazi inclusi , all ’
On . Pecorella per surclassare il Ministro Alfano che , prima dell ’estate , aveva inserito nel DDL intercettazioni una disposizione volta ad estendere a tutti i “ siti informatici ” l’obbligo di rettifica previsto nella vecchia legge sulla stampa e salire , così , sulla cima più alta dell ’
Olimpo dei parlamentari italiani che minacciano – per scarsa conoscenza del fenomeno o tecnofobia – la libertà di comunicazione delle informazioni ed opinioni così come sancita all ’art .
11 della Dichiarazione Universale dei Diritti dell ’ Uomo e del Cittadino e all ’art .
21 della Costituzione .
Con una previsione di straordinaria sintesi e , ad un tempo , destinata – se approvata – a modificare , per sempre , il livello di libertà di informazione in Rete , infatti , l’On .
Pecorella intende aggiungere un comma all ’art .
1 della Legge sulla stampa – la legge n. 47 dell ’ 8 febbraio 1948 , scritta dalla stessa Assemblea Costituente – attraverso il quale prevedere che l’intera disciplina sulla stampa debba trovare applicazione anche “ ai siti internet aventi natura editoriale ” .
Si tratta di un autentico terremoto nella disciplina della materia che travolge d’un colpo questioni che impegnano da anni gli addetti ai lavori in relazione alle condizioni ed ai limiti ai quali considerare applicabile la preistorica legge sulla stampa anche alle nuove forme di diffusione delle informazioni in Rete .
Ma andiamo con ordine .
Quali sono i “ siti internet aventi natura editoriale ” cui l’On .
Pecorella vorrebbe circoscrivere l’applicabilità della disciplina sulla stampa ?
Il DDL non risponde a questa domanda , creando così una situazione di pericolosa ed inaccettabile ambiguità .
Nell ’ Ordinamento , d’altro canto , l’unica definizione che appare utile al fine di cercare di riempire di significato l’espressione “ sito internet avente natura editoriale ” è quella di cui al comma 1 dell ’art .
1 della Legge n. 62 del 7 marzo 2001 – l’ultima riforma della disciplina sull ’editoria – secondo la quale ” Per « prodotto editoriale » ( … ) si intende il prodotto realizzato su supporto cartaceo , ivi compreso il libro , o su supporto informatico , destinato alla pubblicazione o , comunque , alla diffusione di informazioni presso il pubblico con ogni mezzo , anche elettronico , o attraverso la radiodiffusione sonora o televisiva , con esclusione dei prodotti discografici o cinematografici “ .
Si tratta , tuttavia , di una definizione troppo generica perché essa possa limitare effettivamente ed in modo puntuale il novero dei siti internet definibili come “ aventi natura editoriale ” .
Tutti i siti internet attraverso i quali vengono diffuse al pubblico notizie , informazioni o opinioni , dunque , appaiono suscettibili , in caso di approvazione del DDL Pecorella - Costa , di dover soggiacere alla vecchia disciplina sulla stampa .
Ce n’è già abbastanza per pensare – ritengo a ragione – che nulla nel mondo dell ’informazione in Rete , all ’indomani , sarebbe uguale a prima .
Ma c’è di più .
Il DDL Pecorella Costa , infatti , si limita a stabilire con affermazione tanto lapidaria nella formulazione quanto dirompente negli effetti che ” le disposizioni della presente legge ( n.d.r. quella sulla stampa ) si applicano altresì ai siti internet aventi natura editoriale “ .
La vecchia legge sulla stampa , scritta nel 1948 dall ’Assemblea Costituente , naturalmente utilizza un vocabolario e categorie concettuali vecchie di 50 anni rispetto alle dinamiche dell ’informazione in Rete .
Quali sono dunque le conseguenze dell ’equiparazione tra stampa e web che i firmatari del DDL sembrano intenzionati a sancire ?
Se tale equiparazione – come suggerirebbe l’interpretazione letterale dell ’articolato del DDL – significa che attraverso la nuova iniziativa legislativa si intende rendere applicabili ai siti internet tutte le disposizioni contenute nella legge sulla stampa , occorre prepararsi al peggio ovvero ad assistere ad un fenomeno di progressivo esodo di coloro che animano la blogosfera e , più in generale , l ’informazione online dalla Rete .
Basta passare in rassegna le disposizioni dettate dalla vecchia legge sulla stampa per convincersene .
I gestori di tutti i siti internet dovranno , infatti , pubblicare le informazioni obbligatorie di cui all ’art .
2 della Legge sulla stampa , procedere alla nomina di un direttore responsabile ( giornalista ) in conformità a quanto previsto all ’art .
3 , provvedere alla registrazione della propria “ testata ” nel registro sulla stampa presso il tribunale del luogo ove “ è edito ” il sito internet così come previsto all ’art .
5 , aver cura di comunicare tempestivamente ( entro 15 giorni ) ogni mutamento delle informazioni obbligatorie pubblicate e/o richieste in sede di registrazione ( art. 6 ) , incorrere nella “ sanzione ” della decadenza della registrazione qualora non si pubblichi il sito entro sei mesi dalla registrazione medesima o non lo si aggiorni per un anno ( art. 7 ) , soggiacere alle norme in tema di obbligo di rettifica così come disposto dall ’art .
8 che il DDL Pecorella intende modificare negli stessi termini già previsti nel DDL Alfano e , soprattutto , farsi carico dello speciale regime di responsabilità aggravata per la diffusione di contenuti illeciti che , allo stato , riguarda solo chi fa informazione professionale .
Sono proprio le disposizioni in materia di responsabilità a costituire il cuore del DDL Pecorella e converrà , pertanto , dedicargli particolare attenzione .
Cominciamo dalla responsabilità civile .
L’art . 11 della Legge 47/1948 prevede che ” Per i reati commessi col mezzo della stampa sono civilmente responsabili , in solido con gli autori del reato e fra di loro , il proprietario della pubblicazione e l’editore “ .
Non è chiaro come il DDL Pecorella incida su tale previsione ma qualora – come appare nelle intenzioni del legislatore – con l’espressione “ a mezzo della stampa ” , domani , si dovrà intendere “ o a mezzo sito internet ” , ciò significherebbe che i proprietari di qualsivoglia genere di piattaforma rientrante nella definizione di “ sito internet avente natura editoriale ” sarebbero sempre civilmente responsabili , in solido con l’autore del contenuto pubblicato , per eventuali illeciti commessi a mezzo internet .
Fuor di giuridichese questo vuol dire aprire la porta ad azioni risarcitorie a sei zeri contro i proprietari delle grandi piattaforme di condivisione dei contenuti che si ritrovino ad ospitare informazioni o notizie “ scomode ” pubblicate dai propri utenti .
Il titolare della piattaforma potrebbe non essere più in grado di invocare la propria neutralità rispetto al contenuto così come vorrebbe la disciplina europea , giacché la nuova legge fa discendere la sua responsabilità dalla sola proprietà della piattaforma .
Si tratta di una previsione destinata inesorabilmente a cambiare per sempre il volto dell ’informazione online : all ’indomani dell ’approvazione del DDL , infatti , aggiornare una voce su Wikipedia , postare un video servizio su un canale YouTube o pubblicare un pezzo di informazione su una piattaforma di blogging potrebbe essere molto più difficile perché , naturalmente , la propensione del proprietario della piattaforma a correre un rischio per consentire all ’utente di manifestare liberamente il proprio pensiero sarà piuttosto modesta .
Non va meglio , d’altro canto , sul versante della responsabilità penale .
Blogger e gestori di siti internet , infatti , da domani , appaiono destinati ad esser chiamati a soggiacere allo speciale regime aggravato di responsabilità previsto per le ipotesi di diffamazione a mezzo stampa o radiotelevisione .
A nulla , sotto questo profilo , sembrano essere valsi gli sforzi di quanti , negli ultimi anni , hanno tentato di evidenziare come non tutti i prodotti informativi online meritino di essere equiparati a giornali o telegiornale .
Si tratta di un approccio inammissibile che non tiene in nessun conto della multiforme ed eterogenea realtà telematica e che mescola in un unico grande calderone liberticida blog , piattaforme di UGC , siti internet di dimensione amatoriale e decine di altri contenitori telematici che hanno , sin qui , rappresentato una preziosa forma di attuazione della libertà di informazione del pensiero .
Ci sarebbe molto altro da dire ma , per ora , mi sembra importante iniziare a discutere di questa nuova iniziativa legislativa per non dover , in un futuro prossimo , ritrovarci a raccontare che c’era una volta la libertà di informazione in Rete .

In a letter published nearby , Representative Barney Frank takes us to task for an editorial last week in which we noted his absence from the House 's 345- 75 vote to defund Acorn , the " community organizing " group that has been caught on video at least five times offering advice on how to evade the authorities while enslaving children as prostitutes .
Mr. Frank , whose spokesman tells us he would have voted against the measure ( that is , in favor of funding Acorn ) , has a point .
Any implication that he is trying to dodge the matter is mistaken .
Even after the recent revelations , Mr. Frank is a vigorous and unashamed defender of Acorn .
Yesterday he and House Judiciary Chairman John Conyers sent a letter to the Congressional Research Service ( CRS ) requesting a " careful and objective analysis of a number of issues concerning ACORN . "
( Mr. Conyers voted to defund Acorn but later said he did so " accidentally . " )
The Democratic duo also ask CRS whether the legislation defunding Acorn " could constitute an unlawful bill of attainder " by singling out the group — as if the refusal to continue providing federal subsidies is tantamount to punishing it for a crime .
Such Constitutional scruples were not evident in March , when the pair joined all but six House Democrats ( and 85 Republicans ) in voting to impose a 90 % tax on executives of AIG and other disfavored corporations .

A few days ago I was shooting when someone passing by stopped to ask me “ what are all these pieces of glass you put in front of the lens ? ” ” ( ( “ This is a translated version of the question ” ) ) ” so this got me thinking that maybe some of adidap ’s readers are not familiar with filters either !
So today I will be writing about Neutral Density Filters , aka ND Filters , not to be confused with Graduated Neutral Density filters , or ND Grad filters ” ( ( “ I will write about those later ” ) ) ” .
Why are they called Neutral ?
Neutral Density filter are , in essence , just grey filters used to reduce the amount of light passing through the lens and hitting your camera ’s sensor / film .
So , in short , we use them in photography the same way you would wear sunglasses in real life !
They are said to be Neutral because they do not affect the colors in the resulting pictures , they filter out all colors equally .
Why use Neutral Density filters ?
Since ND filters will result in less light they can affect our exposure in 2 drastic ways
A wider aperture : Assuming a fixed shutter speed , less light would mean wider apertures to yield the same exposure A slower shutter :
Assuming a fixed aperture , less light should be , in this case , compensated by a longer exposure time or slower shutter speed
When to use Neutral Density filters ?
Building on the two scenarios we have just discussed ND filter can be very helpful in case you need
A shallower Depth Of Field : Suppose you are shooting in broad daylight a portrait and you want a shallow DOF to isolate you subject .
Depending on the camera you are using , you might quickly be limited by the maximum shutter speed you can set .
A Neutral Density filter will allow you to reach bigger apertures for that same maximum shutter speed .
A slower shutter speed : A typical example is if you are shooting waterfalls !
We all like to capture that milky water effect but , to get it , you need somehow slow shutter speeds .
Speeds that it is not possible to have on a sunny or even light overcast day .
Here too ND filters are our friends eating up that extra light and allowing us to dial down to the speeds we want
When NOT to use Neutral Density Filters
I wo n’t go over the obvious million of situations when you do not want to use ND filers , however I want to pin point that ND filters should be used only when you want to equally reduce light passing through your lens in all the scene you are photographing .
That is why , in the beginning of this post , I told you they should not be confused with ND Grad filters .
ND filters are NOT useful if you are shooting scenes in which different objects are lit differently and you need to expose all of them correctly .
Understanding Neutral Density Filters
ND filters have “ gradings ” depending on the amount of light they cut .
A higher grading means that the filter will filter more light allowing you wider apertures or slower shutter speeds .
They come , AFAIK , in 2 types of notations
0.3 0.6 0.9 ND :
The number here designates the density of the filter .
Every 0.3 will make you lose one stop of light .
So a 0.3ND will cut 1 stop of light 0.6 2 stops etc …
: The number here designates the density of the filter .
Every 0.3 will make you lose one stop of light .
So a 0.3ND will cut 1 stop of light 0.6 2 stops etc… ND2 ND4 ND8 : Another notation for the same logic .
The notation here is based on binary numbers 2=21 i.e 1 stop of light .
4=22 i.e. 2 stop of light etc …
Should I buy one ?
Well if you are a landscape photographer you DEFINITELY need to have an ND or 2 in your bag !
ND filters are of the few filters which effect cannot be reproduced in the digital dark room using Adobe Photoshop or other .
The departure confirmed Obama ’s choice of pragmatism over confrontation , a choice that infuriates his allies on the left .
Beck up , left let down
The resignation early Sunday of “ green jobs ” adviser Van Jones says as much about the Obama White House as it does about Jones – marking the latest sacrifice to the political gods after a long summer of compromises and surrenders highlighted the limits of White House power .
The departure – nominally the choice of a still - defiant Jones , who said he feared distracting from important business – confirmed Obama ’s choice of pragmatism over confrontation and a belief that controversies sometimes are better solved by capitulation , a view that infuriates Obama ’s allies on the left .

It confirmed that the real opposition party to Obama right now is the conservative grassroots that draws its energy from Fox News , talk radio and the Drudge Report , and often leaves Republican elected officials scrambling to catch up .
And it was a fresh reminder that the White House ’s vetting process did n’t fall down only on high - profile nominees like Tom Daschle .
It barely touched the lower reaches of the administration – a White House official conceded Sunday that Jones ’ past statements were n’t as thoroughly scrubbed due to his relatively low rank .
Jones ’ selection also was propelled by powerful patrons , who included the first lady and the vice president .
In his statement , Jones was defiant .
" On the eve of historic fights for health care and clean energy , opponents of reform have mounted a vicious smear campaign against me , ” he said .
“ They are using lies and distortions to distract and divide . ”
White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs cast the move the same way .
“ What Van Jones decided was that the agenda of this president was bigger than any one individual , ” Gibbs said , agreeing with the show ’s host , George Stephanopoulos that Obama “ does n’t endorse ” Jones ’s remarks on race and politics , his apparent flirtation with the “ 9/11 Truth ” movement , and his advocacy for the convicted murderer Mumia Abu - Jamal .
The logic of the departure was clear : A hope of keeping the national conversation where Obama wanted it this week ahead of his health reform speech to a joint session of Congress Wednesday .
“ Between Cambridge cops ; whether administration officials are or are not for the public option ; right wing mobbing at town halls ; and the back to school welcome contretemps , the White House has been forced to play defense and loose - ball control over [ the summer ] , ” said the former Clinton White House aide Chris Lehane , who noted that a “ very important week ” could have been consumed by “ a discussion related to an obscure staffer who no one has ever really heard of . ”
Jones ’s departure resonated sharply , however , with the other topic on Sunday ’s television rotation :
The public insurance option in the health care debate .
There , too , the White House has responded to conservative opposition by pointing first to the outright distortions – and then running the other way .
To the outrage of the House Progressive Caucus , MoveOn , and other liberal voices , Gibbs and senior advisor David Axelrod said Obama this week will continue to advocate for a government - run plan to compete with private plans , but wo n’t insist on it , as some foes have cast the option , inaccurately , as equivalent to a government takeover of all health care delivery .
The Jones departure recalls another Democratic surrender :
The indicated willingness to abandon a plan to fund voluntary end - of - life consultations after they were miscast by former Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin as “ death panels . ”
" As we 've seen before , succumbing to these types of propaganda attacks from the right wing only emboldens the aggressors .
This controversy will go away and they will trump up another one tomorrow , ” said David Brock , founder and chairman of Media Matters for America , a group that has taken on conservative commentators .
“ No good comes from appeasing a lunatic bully like Glenn Beck . "
" If Jones left under pressure from the Obama administration then we are in for a very long and painful four years , ” said Melissa Harris Lacewell , a political science professor at Princeton University .
“ I would hate to think that Glenn Beck can simply shout down any member of the administration he chooses to target . ”
They were referring to the Fox News host who has rocketed to a status as de facto leader of the opposition since joining the network from the relative obscurity of talk radio and CNN Headline News .
Beck 's attacks on Jones intensified after an advocacy group Jones helped found , Color of Change , lead a campaign to drive advertisers away from Beck ’s show .
But as soon as the ensuing controversy began to bleed over onto the websites of ABC News , POLITICO , and other quarters of the mainstream media , the administration appeared to stop defending Jones .
After passing on a statement Thursday from Jones indicating that he would hold fast , Gibbs declined to indicate Friday that he had Obama ’s confidence , and the resignation – apparently timed for maximum obscurity in the early hours of a holiday weekend Sunday – began to seem preordained .
The resignation , in turn , confirmed Beck ’s stature as the administration ’s most potent foe .
Along with the talk radio host Rush Limbaugh and the Drudge Report ’s Matt Drudge , Beck helped drive a summer of protest against health care reform that turned the legislation into a referendum on change and government .
They turned an anodyne presidential pep talk to students Tuesday into an illustration of the wide discomfort in parts of the country with Obama ’s presidency .
And they beat those drums for days before elected officials in Washington jumped on the bandwagon .
Beck , for one , seems unlikely to be satisfied by Jones ’ resignation .
“ Van Jones is the tip of the iceberg , ” Beck said earlier this month .
“ If we understand [ Obama ] by who he surrounds himself with as HE told us , what does [ Van Jones ’s ] 9/11 truther stuff tell us about [ Obama ’s ] Middle East policy ? ”
Beck wrote on Twitter just before Jones ’s resignation .
Some progressives said they saw racial overtones in Jones ’ departure – which came as critics began to step up their scrutiny of Jones ’ past words of support for Abu - Jamal , a former Black Panther on death row whose murder conviction in the death of a police officer is a cause célèbre for some on the left .
" It struck me , why go after this guy ?
He is a minor player , he has no power , no budget , why take him ?
It 's because he looks like Obama and he has all those same attributes of being well - educated and he’s an electrifying speaker with an elite education , " said John Anner , a good friend of Jones and former chair of the Ella Baker Center for Human Rights , an organization Jones founded in Oakland .
" It seems to me that he is symbolic of what the Obama administration is and could be and that 's inspiring for me , but for some people on the right , it 's terrifying and threatening . ”
The third lesson of the Jones flap is less unique to Obama ’s White House , and to the moment .
Jones was just an adviser to the Council on Environmental Quality – he was never officially referred to as a “ green jobs czar , ” as he ’s sometimes been called – but he was also a celebrity of sorts .
His work in California fusing civil rights , economics , and environmentalism put him at the head of powerful streams in the Democratic Party .
He ’d been the subject of a full - length profile in the New Yorker , and top officials sometimes touted him as a kind of trophy hire .
At a commencement address in the spring , first lady Michelle Obama held Jones up as an example to students of people who are doing interesting and innovative work .
" And then there 's Van Jones , who recently joined the Obama administration , a special adviser to the president on green jobs .
Van started out as a grassroots organizer and became an advocate and a creator of ‘ green collar ’ jobs –- jobs that are not only good for the environment , but also provide good wages and career advancement for both skilled and unskilled workers , ” she said .
Obama confidante Valerie Jarrett echoed that praise to a cheering crowd at the Netroots Nation convention this summer .
“ Van Jones , we were so delighted to be able to recruit him into the White House , we have been watching him really ... for as long as he 's been active out in Oakland ... and all of the creative ideas that he has ... and now we have all of that energy and enthusiasm in the White House , " Jarrett said .
And Vice President Joe Biden also had spotted Jones , whom he met at an administration - sponsored roundtable in February , Jones told POLITICO in an interview earlier this year .
" I just spoke from my heart and [ Biden ] looked me right in the eye ... It was n’t like he was taking notes or distracted ...
And he ’s taken those ideas on board and that ’s the kind of person he is , he is very down to earth .. , , and I ’ve since worked very closely with him and his staff to get a lot of those ideas implemented , ” Jones said .
A White House official conceded that Jones “ was not as thoroughly vetted as other administration officials , ” though the official suggested it had more to do with the relatively low level of Jones ’s job than with the power of his patrons .
There was little immediate talk of possible successors to Jones , largely due to the sense he would be difficult to replace in an advisory post designed specifically for him , due to his past work in promoting " green jobs . "
His departure will likely leave the sorest feelings among Obama ’s supporters on the left .
Jones has deep ties to the current liberal elite :
He was a top aide to Huffington Post founder Arianna Huffington ’s 2003 campaign for governor of California , and Sunday won praise from , among others , former Vermont Governor Howard Dean .
“ I think it ’s a loss for the country , ” Dean said .
Flag Etiquette STANDARDS of RESPECT
The Flag Code , which formalizes and unifies the traditional ways in which we give respect to the flag , also contains specific instructions on how the flag is not to be used .
They are :
The flag should never be dipped to any person or thing .
It is flown upside down only as a distress signal .
The flag should not be used as a drapery , or for covering a speakers desk , draping a platform , or for any decoration in general .
Bunting of blue , white and red stripes is available for these purposes .
The blue stripe of the bunting should be on the top .
The flag should never be used for any advertising purpose .
It should not be embroidered , printed or otherwise impressed on such articles as cushions , handkerchiefs , napkins , boxes , or anything intended to be discarded after temporary use .
Advertising signs should not be attached to the staff or halyard
The flag should not be used as part of a costume or athletic uniform , except that a flag patch may be used on the uniform of military personnel , fireman , policeman and members of patriotic organizations .
The flag should never have placed on it , or attached to it , any mark , insignia , letter , word , number , figure , or drawing of any kind .
The flag should never be used as a receptacle for receiving , holding , carrying , or delivering anything .
When the flag is lowered , no part of it should touch the ground or any other object ; it should be received by waiting hands and arms .
To store the flag it should be folded neatly and ceremoniously .
The flag should be cleaned and mended when necessary .
When a flag is so worn it is no longer fit to serve as a symbol of our country , it should be destroyed by burning in a dignified manner .
Note : Most American Legion Posts regularly conduct a dignified flag burning ceremony , often on Flag Day , June 14th .
Many Cub Scout Packs , Boy Scout Troops , and Girl Scout Troops retire flags regularly as well .
Contact your local American Legion Hall or Scout Troop to inquire about the availability of this service .
Displaying the Flag Outdoors
When the flag is displayed from a staff projecting from a window , balcony , or a building , the union should be at the peak of the staff unless the flag is at half staff .
When it is displayed from the same flagpole with another flag - of a state , community , society or Scout unit - the flag of the United States must always be at the top except that the church pennant may be flown above the flag during church services for Navy personnel when conducted by a Naval chaplain on a ship at sea .
When the flag is displayed over a street , it should be hung vertically , with the union to the north or east .
If the flag is suspended over a sidewalk , the flag 's union should be farthest from the building .
When flown with flags of states , communities , or societies on separate flag poles which are of the same height and in a straight line , the flag of the United States is always placed in the position of honor - to its own right .
.. The other flags may be smaller but none may be larger .
.. No other flag ever should be placed above it .
.. The flag of the United States is always the first flag raised and the last to be lowered .
When flown with the national banner of other countries , each flag must be displayed from a separate pole of the same height .
Each flag should be the same size .
They should be raised and lowered simultaneously .
The flag of one nation may not be displayed above that of another nation .
Raising and Lowering the Flag
The flag should be raised briskly and lowered slowly and ceremoniously .
Ordinarily it should be displayed only between sunrise and sunset .
It should be illuminated if displayed at night .
The flag of the United States of America is saluted as it is hoisted and lowered .

In the past , I would have had a fit if someone poured coffee on one of my plants but let me tell you .. there 's a green rubber tree in our office that for the past couple of months have been dosing with coffee and it has become a remarkable looking plant -- very healthy with a lot of growth so there must be something to this coffee thing .
I think it especially likes Starbucks . :-)

DEFICIT SOARS DEFICIT SOARS
The federal budget has gone from surplus to deficit during the past decade .
Fiscal year Surplus or deficit 2000 +$ 236 billion 2001 +$ 128 billion 2002 -$ 158 billion 2003 - $ 378 billion 2004 -$ 413 billion 2005 - $ 318 billion 2006 -$ 248 billion 2007 - $ 161 billion 2008 -$ 459 billion 2009 * - $ 1,841 billion * Estimate
Source : White House WASHINGTON 
Stagnant unemployment , shrinking tax revenue and a struggling economy threaten to quadruple the size of last year 's federal budget deficit , raising more questions about the timing of costly proposals to overhaul health care .
As the White House and Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) prepare to release new deficit estimates this month , several economists say the news is likely to be as bad as or worse than forecasts .
" This is going to be a very depressing outlook , " predicts former CBO director Douglas Holtz - Eakin , top adviser to Republican John McCain in last year 's presidential election .
" They have just a nightmare in terms of these health care bills , which do nothing but make things worse . "
A fiscal year 2009 deficit of $ 1.8 trillion was anticipated by the White House , $ 1.7 trillion by Congress .
Reaching that level would produce a deficit four times last year 's $ 459 billion deficit , just as Congress is considering health care overhaul plans that could cost $ 1 trillion over 10 years .
Lawmakers are struggling to pay for a plan with a mix of tax increases on upper - income people and Medicare spending reductions aimed at doctors , hospitals , drugmakers and insurers .
Some town - hall forums across the U.S. this month have been disrupted by protests for and against proposals .
While revenue continues to decline , government spending is rising as a result of the $ 787 billion economic stimulus plan passed six months ago .
Stimulus spending will increase in the next few months , says Treasury chief economist Alan Krueger .
Deficits of $ 1.8 trillion this year and $ 1.3 trillion in 2010 , as predicted by the White House , would add to the federal debt .
The current $ 11.7 trillion debt already equals about $ 38,500 for every U.S. resident .
The recession , now in its postwar - record 21st month , has dealt a worse blow to the budget than the administration expected : •
The economy is set to shrink by 2.6 % this year , more than twice what the White House predicted in February and May . •
As a result , tax revenue is down by $ 353 billion over 10 months , which is about what the White House thought it would lose for the entire year .
• Unemployment , projected at 8.1 % this year by the White House , was 9.4 % in July .
Spending for jobless benefits , Medicaid and Medicare has soared as people have lost work and health insurance .
Jobless benefits are costing more than twice what was spent last year .
" The deficit picture is very challenging , " White House budget director Peter Orszag wrote on his blog last month .
Sen. Judd Gregg , R - N.H. , top Republican on the Senate Budget Committee , says having a deficit at " previously unthinkable levels … shows an incredible lack of fiscal responsibility . "
Former CBO director Robert Reischauer , president of the non-partisan Urban Institute , an economics and social policy think tank , says administrations tend to believe that " the harder and faster one falls , the more rapid and steep the recovery . "

Let 's take a closer look at this must have tool :
This is the exact tool used by John Gilbert .
I found it at my local Orchard Supply Hardware store .
It is a continuity tester made by GB Instruments .
It requires 2 " AA " batteries .
The LED was purchased at Radio Shack .
You will need to modify the LED in the manner found in the photo .
The current flows in one direction through an LED .
You will need to test it to find the proper direction .
This will work best on the bass string which are the ones that are most likely to buzz .
You could probably restring the guitar to test the trebles .
The reason the basses work and the trebles do n't is that the bass strings are wound with metal which will transmit the flow of electricity .
Our next step is to weave the needle of the continuity tester between the bass strings as found in the photo to the left .
Next we want to touch the LED to the fret that we want to test .
The light bulb that is included with the continuity tester will not light up when exposed to the very short burst of electricity when contact is made between the fret and the string .
The LED on the other hand will light up like a Christmas tree !
They are very sensitive to the slightest amount of electricity flow .
You should test the tool by touching the bass strings .
If it lights up you know it is working properly .
In the photo I am touching the LED to the 6th string and it lights up .
We can now search for a buzz .
Now to start the actual test .
Touch the LED to the fret that you wish to test .
Next pluck the string .
If the fret is indeed the problem you will see a quick flash of light emited from the LED .
If not , test another fret .
It might be hard to tell in this photo , but the LED is touching the fret .
There is obvious contact with the string and the fret .
If there was n't any contact the LED would not glow .

So it seems that DirectX 11 will be supported by Call Of Pripyat , although it ’s not clear what difference that will make to the visual fidelity of the game .
This new video ( below ) shows off lots of lovely real - time shadows and stuff , but I was under the impression that Stalker did that in DirectX 9 anyway …
( There ’s a slightly bizarre comparison of DX9 and DX10 versions of the game here , in which I ’m not sure whether one mode could identifiably called “ better ” than the other from the stills on display . )

A mother describes her family 's struggle to keep their daughter Sophie insured :
In fall of 2005 , we decided to switch from our private , self - employment insurance that we had used for years to Blue Cross .
There was a week long gap between the policies - something that we did n't think anything of , because we simply did not know better .
Just as our Blue Cross plan was set to start , we received a notice from them stating that they considered Sophie to have a pre-existing pulmonary problem ( due to the amount of doctor 's visits for pneumonia ) , and that while they would cover her in general , they would n't cover any pulmonary / respiratory issues until she had gone two years without needing medication or problems .
Our reaction : OMG .
Actually I believe it was OMFG .
All of a sudden , Sophie was without coverage for pulmonary problems .
This was absolutely terrifying .
What if she got sick ?!
What if she needed to be hospitalized ?!
We spent the next couple of months researching every insurance company that we could , begging them to take Sophie .
Nope , it was n't going to happen .
And then our biggest fear came true : Sophie got very , very sick .
Since that horrible October in 2005 , Sophie has needed hundreds of thousands of dollars worth of treatments , hospitalizations , surgeries , medications , testing , and interventions in order to stay strong and healthy , and in some instances , to stay alive .
She has required three bronchoscopies , the middle section of her lung removed , extensive genetic testing , cardiology work ups , dozens of x-rays , CT scans , and a two week trip to a pulmonary hospital in Denver .
When she 's healthy , she requires three steroids , twice a day , and when she 's sick she is usually on five steroids , twice daily .
She 's been diagnosed with right middle lobe syndrome ( though not anymore , since she had it removed ) , a genetic mutation of cystic fibrosis , severe uncontrollable asthma , and severe sinus disease .
And while we 'll gladly continue to live at the poverty level in order to provide our daughter with the healthcare that keeps her alive , we SHOULDN'T HAVE TO .
We would happily pay outrageous premiums and co-pays , and do whatever else it took to get Sophie covered by regular health insurance .
But you know what they all tell us ?
She has to go two years with no pulmonary medications and no doctor 's visits because of respiratory problems before anyone will accept her .
Sophie can't go two DAYS without her medications , let alone two years .

８．ヴィトックスαの真実の口コミは？自分で体験したペニス増大効果まとめ
男性結婚してもう5年ほど経つのですが未だに子供ができません。その理由は、私自身が妻に求めることが少ないので、そういった機会が無かったんです。そんな私に見かねた妻がヴィトックスαを買ってきてくれて、無駄にしてしまうのがもったいなかったので飲み進めてみましたが、2週間ほど経つと今までに感じた事のないぐらいに性欲が湧いてきて、その日は妻と2回するほどでした。今までの自分には考えられません。他の人のヴィトックスα
の口コミ調べてみると、ヴィトックスα にはペニス増大効果にも期待ができるみたいなのでこれからも飲み続けていきます。
男性自分のペニスが小さいのが昔から悩みで勃起時にも７ｃｍ程度にしかならず、彼女とセックスをする時にも満足させることができてるのかとても不安で、そう思うと行為をするのが少し怖くなってきてしまったんです。そのため僕から求めることが減ってしまっていて、それが彼女を不安にさせると同時にものすごく傷つけてしまうことになってしまいました。そこで、藁にもすがる気持ちで口コミで評判の良いヴィトックスα購入し使用を続けて1週間ぐらい経つ頃、怖いと思いかけてた彼女とのセックスがものすごくしたくなり、それを打ち明けると彼女はすごく喜んで受け入れてくれました。3か月飲み続けた結果、サイズも３ｃｍ増えついに憧れの１０ｃｍ台に乗ることが出来ました。サイズアップはもちろんの事、性欲に働きかける効果があったのは自分にとってすごくプラスでした。使ってみて良かったです。
女性私の彼氏のペニスはお世辞にも立派なものとは言えず、正直今まで付き合った中で一番小さいです。もちろんペニスだけを見ているわけでは無いんですけどやっぱ小さいよりは大きい方が良かったなと昔の彼氏と比べちゃう部分があって…でもそんなこと彼氏には言えるわけが無いのでこれも自分のためにと、思い切ってネットで好評だったヴィトックスαを彼氏にプレゼントしてみました（笑）ためしに飲んでもらったらいつもよりペニスの調子がすごく良いみたいで実際にセックスをした時もいつもより硬くなってたように感じました。その後彼氏も自分で購入するようになり、4か月くらい経つ頃には「昔より絶対大きくなった！」と喜んでて、私自身も彼氏とのセックスに満足できるようになったので良かったです。
男性最近歳のせいか、以前のように朝勃ちをしなくなってきた。はっきり言って昔は性欲がものすごく強く、いわゆる「遊び人」だったためか、歳をとってもまだまだ現役でいたいという願望があり、どうにか昔の自分を取り戻したく、精力剤を探してみることにした。普通の薬局で売ってるような精力剤でも良いかと思ったが、ネットで見つけたこのヴィトックスαには、自分のペニスを増大させる効果があるらしく、精力増強の他にもその点に期待していざ購入。結果ははっきり言って大満足。歳を取ってしまっている自分には効果は薄いんじゃないかと思っていたが、昔の元気を取り戻すどころか昔より元気になっているんじゃないかと思うぐらいになった。サイズや太さも大体２ｃｍぐらいはアップしているように思える。
男性ヴィトックスαを1箱分買って飲んでみたけど全くサイズアップしない。確かにいつもよりムラムラしたり、ペニスがギンギンになったりしたけど、5日でサイズが大きくなるなんてことは無かった。キャンペーンでもう1箱プレゼントされたけどあんまり飲む気がしない。ペニスのサイズアップ効果を期待してわざわざ金を出してこれを飲むのはちょっともったいないんじゃないかなーと思った。
男性私の場合欲張ってヴィトックスαを1日4粒ずつ飲んでみたのだが1か月たったところで全く効果なし。もうおじさんだからいくら飲んでも効果が無いのか？それに体質が合わなかったのか、少しおなかが緩くなることもあった。色んな所でおすすめされてたから買ってみたけどもう買わないかな。
男性こういうサプリメントはうさんくさいとは思ってたんだけど、ほんとにここまで効果が出ないとは思わなかった。2，3粒飲んで捨てました。ヴィトックスαの口コミ見てると○カ月飲んだって人もいるけど、よくそこまで飲み続けられるな。
男性元々自分のペニスが小さいってわけじゃないけど、これで大きくなるならいいなと思ってヴィトックスαを4ヶ月分くらい飲んでみたけど、多分１ｃｍ伸びたか伸びてないくらい。他のヴィトックスαの口コミを書いてる人みたいに３ｃｍとか伸びてるわけじゃないからちょっと不満。
ヴィトックスαの良い口コミを書いている人たちを見てみると、最初は効果をあまり信じていないものの、飲んでみたら効果が出たという人が多いように思いました。驚いたのが、男性だけでなく女性の口コミもあったことです。この女性が直接ヴィトックスαを飲んだというわけじゃないみたいですが、女性目線でも彼氏のペニスのサイズが大きくなることは嬉しいみたいですね…
そしてこの効果が出ている人たちに共通しているのが、ヴィトックスαを3か月以上飲み続けているという事。それに対してヴィトックスαの悪い口コミを書いている人たちは1ヶ月かそれより短い期間で飲む事を辞めてしまっているという感じです。中には4ヶ月飲んでも１ｃｍ程度しか伸びなかったという人もいるみたいですが、やはりサプリメントである以上個人差も生まれるみたいです。
ヴィトックスαの良い口コミと悪い口コミをまとめると、ヴィトックスαはある程度の期間飲み続けていれば効果が出る可能性がある…という事なんですかね？確かに僕が以前飲んだペニス増大サプリは5ヶ月飲んでも全く変化なしだったのでそれと比べたらまだ効果はあるのかも…
ちょっとまだ確証は持てないので、実際に自分でも飲んで試してみたいと思います！
＞ ＞3か月以上で確かな効果！ヴィトックスαはこちら
昔から自分のペニスが小さいことがコンプレックスで、昔付き合ってた彼女に見せた時も「かわいい」と言われてしまったこともあります。正直その時は屈辱以外の何物でもなく、しばらくセックスをするのが嫌になるほど落ち込みました…そして二度とそんな思いをしたくないと思ってペニス増大サプリに手を出したものの、一度は騙される始末…
評判の良かったヴィトックスαの口コミを見てみても、なんだか胡散臭いという印象が完璧に晴れたというわけではありません。まだ効果自体は疑っていますので、期待半分、疑い半分という気持ちでヴィトックスαを飲んでみて体験してみたいと思います。
こちらがヴィトックスαです！
詳細は後述しますが、キャンペーンで3箱お得に入手できたのでちょうど3か月分試してみたいと思います。
これ見てください…というか見るのがちょっと嫌になりそうなくらい文字がびっしりと書いてありますが、これほとんどがヴィトックスαに入っている成分らしいんですよ…
数はおよそ100種類以上らしいです。こんなにあるとなんか適当な成分も入ってるんじゃないかと疑ってしまいます。
なんだか中の成分をよく見てみるとハバネロ末やらタツノオトシゴ末やらブタ睾丸エキス末やら…
大丈夫なんですかねこれ!?
そして箱を開けたら出てきたのがこれです。
まさかの真っ黒なカプセルｗｗｗ
これ本当に飲まなきゃいけないんですかね…なんだか罰ゲームみたいです。
でもまぁものすごくカプセルが大きかったりするわけじゃなく、嫌なニオイとかがするわけでもないのですが、味はどうなんでしょう…
3ヵ月続けなきゃならないんですもんね。飲みづらかったりしたら速攻で辞めてしまいそうな気がします。
とりあえず勇気を振り絞って飲んでみましたが特に味はありませんでした！
こんな真っ黒なカプセルは見たことなかったのでどんなやばい味がするのかと思った少し拍子抜けです。
でもまぁこれなら飲むのが苦では無さそうなので、途中経過を書きつつ3か月飲み進めていきたいと思います！
という事で僕は1日1粒ずつ飲み進めて行ったのですが、効果が表れ始めたのは飲み始めて6日ごろぐらいですね。
なんだかいつもよりものすごくムラムラするうえに、勃起した時にいつもよりものすごくバッキバキになっている気がしたんです。
これならもしかして大きさも！？と思い定規を取り出してサイズも測ってみたんですけど、残念ながらそっちはまだ変化はありませんでした…
でも確実に精力は増している感覚があって正直それだけでも結構嬉しかったのですがせっかく3箱分あるので全部飲んでみることにします！
1日1粒を飲み続け、3箱分のヴィトックスαが飲み終える頃には以前までの自分とは明らかに違う自分がいました。友達の女の子や職場の女性から見ても僕は雰囲気が変わったみたいで「すごく積極的になったし、ちょっと頼もしくなったね」と言われるようになりました。ヴィトックスαの効果で精力が増したことで、すごく意欲的になり男として自分に自信が持てるようになってきたのかもしれません！
それともう一つ重要なのが、ペニスのサイズ。
なんと本当に実際のサイズもアップしたんです！！！
飲み始める前は勃起時で8.7�pだったものが、飲み終える頃には11.9�pになるまで成長していました！つまり3.2�pアップです！
ちなみに、こういうペニス増大系のサプリって副作用が出ることもあるらしいんですけど、ヴィトックスαに関しては飲んでいても身体に悪い異変などは起きませんでした。だからと言って飲みすぎたらダメでしょうけど、メーカー指定の範囲内であれば副作用が出ることはないと思います！
なんというか…公式サイトがうさんくさかったり圧倒的に良い口コミが多かったりで嘘っぽいなーって思ってたんですけど、本当にペニス増大効果があったことに只々驚いております。
口コミを振り返ってみてもそうなんですけど、ヴィトックスαには即効性が無いので最低3ヵ月は続ける必要がありますが、それを続ければちゃんとした効果があるという事がわかりました。
過去には全く効果の無いペニス増大サプリを掴まされて騙された僕ですが、ヴィトックスαは良い意味で僕の事を騙してくれました！

■そもそもどんな仕組みでペニスは成長していくのか
ペニスはどのような仕組みで成長していくのか…知りたいと思っているのは僕だけじゃないと思います。ずばりペニスの成長で大切になるのは男性ホルモンです。ここからはどうやってペニスが成長していくかを見ていきたいと思います。
最初にペニスという存在が生まれるのはお母さんのおなかの中です。お母さんのおなかの中には男性ホルモンが分泌されていて、この男性ホルモンが赤ちゃんに働きかけることでペニスが作られることになります。ちなみに、この時にお母さんのおなかのなかで男性ホルモンの分泌が十分じゃなかった場合はペニスが成長しきれないことがあるらしいです。一般的には3.5cm以下のペニスが治療の対象と言われれていて、通称「ミクロペニス」というらしいです。
お母さんの体で男性ホルモンの分泌が少なくなる原因としては体質もあるみたいですが、ほとんどはスナック菓子みたいな男性ホルモンの分泌を妨げる食べ物を過剰に摂取したことが原因になるみたいです。スナック菓子をはじめとしたジャンクフードは男性ホルモンの分泌を妨げる成分が入っているものが多いらしいです。
この記事を読んでる女の子がいたら、ジャンクフードを今すぐやめましょう！将来生まれてくる息子にちっこいペニスという十字架を背負わせたくなければ！
さて、その後は人間の体の成長とともにペニスもすくすく育っていきます。そして、生まれて15年が経過した頃、
、つまり成長期に入ります。15歳くらいから大学を卒業する22歳くらいまでが体と同様にペニスの成長期となっています。この成長期の時期に入るとまずペニスよりも玉のほう、つまり睾丸が成長することになります。「睾丸って何のためについてんのかな、必要なの？」、そんなことを思ったことがあるのは僕だけじゃないのでは(笑)
実はこの睾丸には男性ホルモンを生成するという大切な役割があるんです。それで、睾丸が成長して男性ホルモンをどんどん分泌させるようになってからが本格的なペニスの成長がスタートします。この時期に規則正しい健康的な生活を送っていると、成長ホルモンが分泌されます。その結果、将来ペニスサイズに悩むことが無いビッグな男になることができるらしいです。
思春期の頃、僕は夜更かしと暴飲暴食に明け暮れていたので、これがペニスサイズという形で現れたのかも…。
20代も中盤になってくると、体の成長も完全にストップします。それに伴い、悲しいかなペニスサイズの成長もストップします。この時点で完全に勝負あり…いえいえ、敗者復活戦があります。20代中盤以降でもばっちりペニスを成長させることは出来るんです！経験者の僕が保障します。
じゃあ、どうやってペニスを成長させるかですが、結局ここでも鍵になるのは男性ホルモンです。思春期の頃のような爆発的な男性ホルモンの分泌は期待できませんが、サプリメントなどを摂取することで男性ホルモンの分泌量を増やしてやることはできます。男性ホルモンさえ増やしてやれれば、全然大丈夫！いくつになってもペニスサイズを大きくすることは出来ます。
あと、ペニスサイズを大きくする上では海綿体を成長させることも意識する必要があります。この海綿体っていうのはペニスをつくっている細胞になります。ペニスはこの海綿体っていう細胞に血液が流れ込んできて風船のように膨らむことで、勃起する仕組みになってるんです。
ちなみに、この海綿体は血液がたくさん流れ込んでくると、それに負けないようにどんどん成長していくって特徴があるんです。つまり、海綿体に血液を流す、要はペニスの血行を促進してやることでどんどん海綿体のサイズが大きくなって勃起した時のサイズが目覚ましく成長していくんです。
ちなみにサイズアップをめざすなら、早ければ早いほど断然有利！やっぱり年齢を重ねれば重ねるほど、サイズアップの速度も遅くなってくるのは事実です。男性ホルモンの分泌量については20〜30歳を基準に考えると、40歳で30％減少、60歳では50％減少、80歳では70％減少といった具合に年齢に比例して減少していきます。つまり、20代が1ヶ月で5cmのサイズアップが見込めるサプリメントをつかったとしても、60代の場合は1cmのサイズアップしかできないケースは十分にあります。
＞＞早ければ早いほど有利！ヴィトックスαはコチラ！
巷にはペニスのサイズアップに役立つ方法としてさまざまな方法が提唱されています。例えば通称「チントレ」と言われるような性器周辺の筋力を鍛える方法なんかがありますが、あくまでもペニスサイズアップのポイントは男性ホルモンの分泌量増加と性器周辺の血流促進が大切になるため、このような方法の効果は期待薄です。あと、手術で無理やりペニスサイズアップするという方法もあるのですが、費用がかなり高額になります。例えば、ペニスのサオの部分にリパスと呼ばれる注射剤を注入する方法であれば4〜8万円の費用が掛かると言われています。ペニスサイズをすぐにアップしたい、かつお金がたくさんあるならばこういった方法を取ることも選択肢の一つになりますが、現実的なことを考えると生活習慣などを改善することでペニスアップを目指す方が自然な形でペニスアップが望めます。
では、ここからペニスを成長させるために意識したいことを紹介します。
それはずばり 「 睡眠 」 と「 食事」です 。
しっかりと睡眠をとって、ペニスの成長のためになる食事をとるということが大切になります。ペニスの成長に大切なのは男性ホルモンですが、この男性ホルモンがガンガン作られるような状態をつくるためには睡眠が大切です。睡眠の質を高めることを考えたら22時〜翌2時の間がホルモンの分泌が活発になるため、その時間にはベッドに入っていることが最も効果的です。
あと、食事もものすごく大切なようですね。食材の中には男性ホルモンの分泌を促したり、血行促進効果がある栄養素を含んだものなんかもたくさん存在しているので、こういった食材をしっかり食事に取り入れることが本当に大切になります。
この栄養素の話は次の項目でもう少し掘り下げますが、そのペニス増大の鍵を握る栄養素が「シトルリン」と「アルギニン」という成分です。
さて、シトルリン・アルギニンについては、なかなか食事の中で摂取していくのは手間がかかります。シトルリンについては豊富に含んでいる食材というのがあまり存在しません。また、アルギニンを豊富に含んでいる食材については注意が必要です。アルギニンを豊富に含んでいる食材の中には食べ過ぎると悪玉コレステロールを増やして肥満の原因になると言われているものが多くなっています。せっかくペニスサイズが大きくなっても、デブになってしまうと、それはそれでまた新しい悩みを抱えることになります。
このように考えると、食事でシトルリン・アルギニンを摂るのは効果的な方法とはいいがたいものがあるため、そこで役に立つのがヴィトックスαのようなサプリなのです。そのため、ペニスのサイズアップを考えるなら、ペニス増大サプリは必須なのです。

ヴィトックスαは自分でも使ってみて実際に効果があるということはわかったんですけど、そこで気になったのは「なんでここまで効果があったんだろう？」という事です。ペニス増大サプリとしてのヴィトックスαの特徴やヴィトックスαに含まれる成分について調べていきたいと思います！
ヴィトックスαを語る上で最も重要になってくるのがシトルリンとアルギニン。ペニス増大サプリには必要不可欠とも言われているこの２つの成分は一体どんな効果を発揮してくれるのでしょうか？
■シトルリン・アルギニンのペニス増大効果
男性はとくにサプリなどを飲まずとも、ペニスが大きくなる時があると思います。
そう、それは勃起です。
勃起のメカニズムはペニスを構成している海綿体に血が流れることで、その海綿体が膨らんでペニスが大きく、固くなります。海綿体に流れこむ血の量が増える事で海綿体がもっと血を受け入れるために成長し、ペニスの増大にも繋がるという仕組みというのは先ほども説明しましたね？
そこで、ヴィトックスαに含まれているシトルリンは血管を拡張する効果があると言われており、海綿体に流れ込む血の量を増やしてくれる効果があります。
アルギニンにもシトルリンと同様ペニスに流れる血流を増やしてくれる効果や、男性ホルモンの分泌をアップさせる効果がありますが、このシトルリンとアルギニンは同時に摂取することで相乗効果を発揮し、更なる血流アップの効果が期待できるんです！
■ヴィトックスαはシトルリンの効果を実感しやすい！
ヴィトックスαは旧型の商品から「 ヴィトックスα EXTRA edition」とリニューアルしたことでシトルリンの量が従来の2倍に増量したようです。
詳細な配合量は企業秘密なようで公開されていませんが、ヴィトックスαでは主成分としていることと、先ほど説明したアルギニンとの相乗効果が期待できることが強みです。
似たような効果を持つという事で開発費を抑えるために、シトルリンかアルギニンどちらか一方しか含んでいないペニス増大サプリが多いのですが、ヴィトックスαはその効果が期待できるんです。
余談ですが、この２つの成分は食材で摂取するのも不可能ではなく、シトルリンについてはスイカ、メロン、トマト、キュウリといった食材、アルギニンについてはエビ、マグロ、大豆に含まれています。
とはいえペニス増大に効果的な量のシトルリンやアルギニンを食事から摂取しようとなると、非常に多くの量の食材を食べなくてはなりません。
唯一スイカだけは100gで180mgもシトルリンが含まれているので、摂取することで1日に必要なシトルリンの量を取ることが出来ますが、毎日スイカを食べるという事は現実的ではありませんよね。
そんな身体に不足しがちなシトルリンやアルギニンの摂取をサポートしてくれるのがヴィトックスαなんです。
シトルリンやアルギニンは同時に配合しているペニス増大サプリこそそこまで多くないのですが、それぞれ単体で見ると配合されている事は多い、いわば基本的な成分です。では何故他のペニス増大サプリと比較してヴィトックスαは多くの人に選ばれているのかというと、その秘密は「レスベラトロール」という成分にあるんです！
■ヴィトックスαの目玉レスベラトロールって？
レスベラトロールっていうとあまりなじみがないですけど、ポリフェノールの一種って説明すると、とたんにイメージが湧くかもしれませんね。赤ワイン等に多く含まれているポリフェノールには抗酸化作用と呼ばれる働きがあることが分かっていますが、抗酸化作用というのは老化の原因になる活性酸素と呼ばれる成分を除去する働きで、この抗酸化作用が強ければそれだけ老化の進行を防ぐことができます。
ただ、このレスベラトロールにはただの抗酸化作用ではなく、もっと強力な働きがあることが分かっています。それが「サーチュイン遺伝子」という遺伝子の働きを活性化させるというものです。
このサーチュイン遺伝子は普段は眠ったままの状態でその働きを発揮していませんが、ひとたびこのサーチュイン遺伝子が目覚めると、細胞の働きを活性化するミトコンドリアの活動が活発化します。その結果、100以上と言われる老化の原因を抑えるために絶大な効果を発揮します。一説にはこのサーチェイン遺伝子を目覚めたままにすることが出来れば、人間の平均寿命は平均寿命は100歳を超えるのではないかという説もあるほど老化防止に役立つと言われているんです。
その結果、ペニスの細胞にも働きかけて成長したり、ペニスの機能向上に期待ができます。また、レスベラトロール自体にも血行促進効果があるため、ペニスの海綿体に血液を流し込んでペニスのサイズアップを実現するのに一役買っています。
上記で紹介したメインの成分以外にもペニスのサイズアップに効果を発揮するユニークな成分がたくさんヴィトックスαには配合されているので、少し紹介したいと思います。
馬の睾丸…ちょっと聞いた時にひいてしまいました…そんなものが入っているのかと(笑)ただ、この馬の睾丸を摂取する効果は捨てたもんじゃありませんよ！馬睾丸の一番の魅力はプロタミンというタンパク質。このプロタミンには精力増強作用があることがわかっています。また、男性ホルモン自体も馬睾丸に含まれているので、馬睾丸の成分を摂取することで体内で男性ホルモンを増やすこともできます。
クジラエキスはその名の通りクジラから抽出したエキスになります。クジラはほとんど餌を食べずに絶食状態で数千キロも離れた餌場に泳ぎ着くことが出来ます。この驚異的なパワーを支えているのがバレニンというアミノ酸の働きであると考えられています。このバレニンというアミノ酸を含んでいるのがクジラエキスになります。クジラエキスには疲労回復効果・抗酸化作用などがあります。また、ペニスのサイズアップということで考えると、血行促進効果がある点に注目されヴィトックスαに配合されています。
オルニチンはしじみなどに含まれていることでよく知られている成分になります。このオルニチンには男性ホルモンの分泌を促進する効果と細胞分裂を活性化する効果があると言われています。特に細胞分裂についてはオルニチンが体内に入ることにより、ポリアミンという成分に変換され、このポリアミンの働きにより、活性化されることが分かっているので、ペニスのサイズアップも期待できます。
ヴィトックスαはこの他にも100種類以上の天然成分を配合しています。一般的にサプリメントっていうのは配合成分が多ければ多いほど、優秀なサプリメントになるっていう原則があるみたいです。その点から考えてもそこまでの量の成分を配合しているヴィトックスαは優秀なペニス増大サプリであるという事がわかります。
ヴィトックスαはペニス増大に優秀な成分を100種以上配合しているのでペニス増大効果に関しては申し分ないのですが、ただ一点気になるのは副作用の問題ですよね。
ペニスのサイズアップと引き換えに健康を犠牲にしてしまっては元も子もありませんので調べてみた所、ヴィトックスαには副作用の心配が無いということがわかりました！
■ヴィトックスαは純日本製だから副作用なし！
海外のペニス増大サプリと聞くとなんだか効果がすごいありそうなイメージがありませんか？実はその考えは危険なんです。海外のペニス増大サプリは外国人の体型や体質に合わせて作られているため、日本では認可されていない成分や配合量で製造されている可能性があり、その影響で副作用が出てしまうことがあるんです。ですがヴィトックスαは、元々はアメリカ生まれのサプリではありますが、日本で販売されいる分のヴィトックスαに関しては日本人に合わせて成分が調整されているため、副作用は報告されていません。
■ヴィトックスαは天然成分ベースだから副作用なし！
いくら日本で販売されていたとしても医薬品などに使われている化学物質には少なからず副作用の報告があります。薬局で売っているような風邪薬でも、中には身体に合わず頭痛などを起こしてしまう人もいますが、ヴィトックスαは天然成分をベースにして製造されているので副作用の心配はありません！上記で紹介したシトルリンやアルギニンは「アミノ酸」の一種で、馬の睾丸に至ってはド天然の成分ですよねｗ
自分もヴィトックスαを3ヶ月使っていましたが全然問題ありませんでしたので、ヴィトックスαには副作用は無いと言っていいでしょう。

口コミ評判も良く、実際にペニス増大効果もあり、副作用も無いと来たヴィトックスαですが、実際に買うとなった場合はどこから購入するのが最もお得なのか調べてみました。
ヴィトックスαはドラッグストアなどの店舗では販売されていないのでネット上のみからしか購入できません。ネットから変えるとなると選択肢が多いように見えますが、最初に答えを言ってしまうとヴィトックスαを購入する時は公式サイトから買うのが最もお得なんです！
■公式から買うと+1箱キャンペーン！
ヴィトックスαは公式サイトから購入すると、通常価格が1箱19,800円のところを12,800円で購入できるのでそれだけでもかなりお得に見えますが、それに加えて更に1箱追加でヴィトックスαがプレゼントしてもらえるキャンペーンが公式サイトでは開催されているんです！
特別な購入の仕方をするわけではなく、公式サイトから1箱ヴィトックスαを購入するだけで、もう１箱無料でついてくるので、「12,800円÷2＝6,400円」、つまり実質1箱6,400円の値段で購入できるってことになりますね。もはやもとの値段( 19,800円)の1/3程度の価格になってしまいます。
こ の1箱プレゼントキャンペーンは毎週先着500人限定になっているので、買おうと思ったら即公式サイトを覗いてみる事をおすすめします！
■偽物の心配なし ！
当たり前と言ったら当たり前なんですけど、公式サイトから購入をすれば偽物のヴィトックスαが送られてくることはありません。偽物とまではいかなくても、アメリカ製のヴィトックスαやリニューアル前の旧型のヴィトックスαが存在しているのは事実です。折角お金を払ってそれらが届いてしまったら充分な効果が得られないので、偽物を買わないように公式サイトから購入しましょう。
■品名欄を空欄で配達してくれる！
これは同居人がいる方には非常にありがたいキャンペーンなのでは？ヴィトックスαという名前を見ただけではペニス増大サプリを買ったとバレる心配は薄いですが、もしネットで検索をされてしまったら残念ながらバレてしまいますｗ
ですが公式から購入した場合はそういった面にも配慮してくれて、伝票書の品名を空欄にしてくれて、無地の段ボールで届けてくれます。同居人に勝手に荷物を開けられてしまうという人でも営業所止めができるので開けられる心配がなくて安心ですね。
そうなってくると多くの人が活用しているのがAmazonや楽天と言った大手のショッピングサイトですが、どれくらいの価格で販売されいるのでしょうか？
・ Amazonのヴィトックスαの料 金 10,750 円 〜
・楽天のヴィトックスαの料金 13,478円〜
値段だけを見る とAmazonに売ってるヴィトックスαの料金が安いように見えますね？だったらAmazonで買った方がお得なんじゃない？と思う方がいるかもしれませんが、Amazonや楽天といったショッピングサイトでは1箱プレゼントキャンペーンが開催されていないんです！
それに 、Amazonではヴィトックスαの旧商品やヴィトックスαの画像だけど「ボルテックス」という名前で販売されているものもあったので、正規品が届かない可能性も考えられます。Amazonや楽天でもヴィトックスαは買えなくはないけど、公式で買った方が圧倒的に安全でお得ですね。
＞＞ヴィトックスαを買うなら公式がお得！公式サイトはこちら
まず大前提として、ヴィトックスαのメーカーが推奨している1日の摂取量は1〜3粒となっています。前述したとおり、過剰摂取になってしまうと副作用が起きてしまう可能性がありますので、この量は超えないように気を付けましょう。
これは僕自身の体験談にも繋がるんですけど、僕は3ヵ月間1日1粒ずつ飲み続けていました。ぶっちゃけて言ってしまうと1日3粒のペースで飲んじゃうと10日で無くなっちゃうのでお金がもったいなくて…ｗ
ペニスに限ったことでは無いんですけど、人間の身体ってすぐに変化があるというわけじゃないので、ヴィトックスαを1日3粒飲んだとしても純粋に効果の出るスピードが3倍になるという事は考えられません。
もちろん個人差はありますけど、コスパよくヴィトックスαを飲み進めていきたいという人は1日1粒。そして3カ月後のペニス増大効果を高めたいという方はヴィトックスαを1日2〜3粒飲むという方法をおすすめします。
人間が最も成長をするのは夜寝ている時だと言われています。もっと言うと22時〜2時の間に成長ホルモンが分泌されるゴールデンタイムだと言われているので、その時間帯に寝ていることが一番良いのですが、22時前に眠るのはなかなか難しいですよね。
そして、栄養が身体に吸収されるまでもおよそ2時間ほどかかると言われているので、なるべく20時前に夜ご飯を食べて栄養の吸収が活発になっている状態の時にヴィトックスαを飲んでおき、22時とは言わずとも早めに布団に入っておく事でヴィトックスαのペニス増大効果を上げる事が期待できますよ。
最初に書いたように1日の摂取量を守る事はもちろんですが、ヴィトックスαを飲む時はしっかりと「水」または「お湯」で飲むように気を付けましょう。これは水以外の飲み物で飲んでしまうとヴィトックスαの吸収を邪魔してしまうからです。
また、ペニス増大においては血行がキーポイントになっているので、血行に害や変化を与えてしまうお酒やタバコは極力控えるようにすると良いでしょう。ただしそれが逆にストレスになってしまうとそれも血行に悪影響を与える事になってしまうので、断酒、禁煙ではなく控えるという事がポイントです。
ヴィトックスαの公式ページを見てみると、サプリメント同時に、ヴィトックスリキッドというローションが発売されています。「塗るヴィトックス」というコンセプトの元販売されているようですが、このヴィトックスリキッドはどういった効果を持つ商品なのか調べてみました。
ヴィトックスリキッドは5つの成分で構成されています。それがシトルリン、アルギニン、イチョウ葉エキス、クララエキス、トコフェロールになります。
このうちシトルリン、アルギニンの効果については上記で説明してきました。特にシトルリンは直接ペニスに塗ってやることにより、さらにペニス周辺の血行促進効果を高めることが出来ます。また、イチョウ葉エキス、クララエキス、トコフェロールについても同様に血行を促進する効果を持っている成分になります。ローションタイプになってペニスに直接塗ることにより、身体の外側からペニス周辺の血行を促進することに特化しているのがこのヴィトックスリキッドなんです。
ヴィトックスリキッドの使用法は簡単です。ただ、オナニーをするときにペニスに塗ってやるだけでOKです。このヴィトックスリキッドを塗って自慰行為を行っているとペニスが熱を持ったような感じになったり、バキバキに固くなる感覚を感じることが出来ると思います。これはヴィトックスリキッドが効果を発揮している証拠です。
また、ヴィトックスリキッドを使うと自慰行為での快感が増すとも言われており、一度使うと癖になるという男性も多いようです。その点でもこのヴィトックスリキッドを使うメリットはあります。使い方は以上で非常に簡単ですが、注意したいのはこのヴィトックスリキッドを塗布する場合は亀頭のみ・サオのみといった形ではなくペニス全体にくまなく塗布することです。また、自慰行為が終わった後はヴィトックスリキッドを流し落とす必要があります。そのため、しっかりシャワーを浴びる、もしくはお風呂に入るようにしましょう。
このヴィトックスαリキッドは単品で購入すると12,800円なんですけど、サプリメントとのセット販売もやっていて、このセット販売で購入するとヴィトックスαとヴィトックスリキッドが17,900円で購入することが出来ます。
単品で購入すると 、 「 19,800 円 ( ヴィトックスα )
＋12,800 円( ヴィトックスリキッド)
＝32,600円」、合計で32,600円になるので、約45％オフとなりかなりお得です。そしてこちらにも1箱無料でついてくるキャンペーンが適用されているので、つまり17,900円でサプリのヴィトックスα2箱＋ヴィトックスリキッド2箱が手に入れることが出来るんです。
併用することでペニス増大効果も増し、同時購入することでお得なので、「すぐにでもペニスアップしたい！」という人はヴィトックスリキッドも併用していくことがおすすめですね。ヴィトックスαで体の内側から、ヴィトックスαリキッドで体の外側からそれぞれペニスのサイズアップに働きかけていくことが出来ますよ。どうせならこの機会に僕自身もヴィトックスリキッドも購入しようかと思っています。

ヴィトックスα以外にも当然ペニスのサイズアップを目的にしたペニス増大サプリというのはたくさん販売されています。その中でも代表的な商品である極GOLDとヴィトックスαを比較してみたいと思います。
極 GOLD というペニス増大サプリはよくヴィトックスαとの比較で取り上げられることの多いペニス増大サプリになります。その理由としては配合成分にかなり共通点が多いことが挙げられます。極GOLDの配合成分29種をざっと見ても、マカ・トンカットアリ・シトルリン・オルニチン・アルギニン・亜鉛、カンカエキス、ビタミンB類などとなっており、配合29種類のうちほとんど全ての成分がヴィトックスαにも配合済みのものになっています。ヴィトックスαはこの極GOLDの成分はほとんど含んだ上で、それに加えて全100種類とも言われる成分を配合していることになります。やはり配合成分の数で圧倒的に勝るヴィトックスαの方が比較すると優秀なサプリであるということが出来るでしょう。
極 GOLD については1箱(30日分)12,778円となっており、ヴィトックスαの純粋な1箱の価格12,800円と比較するとほんの少し安いですね。そして極GOLDは5箱セットで購入することで、1箱あたりの単価を9,222円まで下げることが出来ます。しかし、極GOLDとヴィトックスαが決定的に違うのは「1箱プレゼントキャンペーンがあるかないか」です。
何度も説明しているように、ヴィトックスαは1箱分の値段で2箱分のヴィトックスαを手に入れる事ができるので、1箱分の値段が実質6,400円になります。極GOLDにはそういったキャンペーンは無く、最安値で購入したとしてもヴィトックスαを現在のキャンペーンを利用して購入した場合の1箱6,400円という値段には敵いませんので価格面でもヴィトックスαに軍配が上がりました。
Amazonで検索した時に出てきた「ボルテックス」というワードですが、実際にそういったペニス増大サプリが過去に存在していたという事がわかりました。
配合されている主成分としてはヒハツ・カンカ・カイアボ芋・ゴツゴラと呼ばれる成分が配合されており、配合成分の数は全部で10種類になります。ただ、上述しましたが、サプリメントについてはその配合成分の数というのが一つの良し悪しを決める要素になります。
ヴィトックスαに配合されている成分が100種類以上なのと比較すると、ボルテックスの10種類というのは非常に寂しい感じを受けます。また、ボルテックスについてはペニスのサイズアップよりも精力増強効果の方が報告されていることも多く、ペニスのサイズアップに成功したとしても時間がかなりかかるという意見もあります。即効性という点ではヴィトックスαに軍配が上がるでしょう。
このボルテックスについては1箱(30日分)
を12,400円で購入することが出来ますが、このボルテックスも極GOLDと同様に1箱プレゼントキャンペーンと言ったものは行われておりません。それを踏まえると1箱実質6,400円になるヴィトックスαの方が圧倒的にお得ですね。
＞＞総合評価満点！ヴィトックスαはコチラ！
そもそもペニス増大サプリというもの自体に疑いを持っている所から始まった僕でしたが、ヴィトックスαを買ってみてよかったです。成分や実績などから考えたサプリメントとしての優秀さや自分自身が3.2�pもサイズアップしたという経験から、自信を持って知り合いや友だちにもおすすめできるサプリメントだなと思いました。また、他のペニス増大サプリメントと比較すると、一見高価な感じがするヴィトックスαですが、ヴィトックスαリキッドとのセット販売で購入すると、意外に安価に購入できることも分かりました。加えて、現在実施中のキャンペーンは非常にお得ですね。一箱無料でサービスしてもらえるなんて、こんなチャンスはめったにないと思います。
もし、ヴィトックスαに興味が湧いてきたなら、今が買い時なんじゃないかなぁと思います。ペニスのサイズアップは早めに対策を始めた方がその効果も大きいですよ。悩んでいるなら、思い切ってヴィトックスαを購入してサイズアップ対策をスタートするのがいいと思います。

A book published this year in Brazil on “ The Physics of Nuclear Explosives ” prompted concerns at the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) that it revealed classified nuclear weapons design information and that it might signify a renewed interest by Brazil in developing such weapons .
The U.S. Government also requested further details on the matter , the Brazilian press reported .
According to the Jornal do Brasil , which first disclosed the controversy on September 6 , the IAEA “ wanted the book to be recalled ” and demanded more information on the author ’s work .
The government of Brazil refused to censor the book and rejected what it described as IAEA interference .
“ The Physics of Nuclear Explosives ” ( “ A Física dos Explosivos Nucleares ” ) by Dalton E.G. Barroso provides a rather comprehensive account of the physical principles involved in nuclear detonations , including both fission and fusion weapons .
There are chapters on reactor physics , radiation hydrodynamics , dynamic compression of solids , inertial confinement fusion , and more .
Most of this information is already freely available to those who care to search for it .
But the author has broken new ground in presenting the results of his numerical simulations of nuclear detonations and characterizations of particular weapons , such as the W - 87 warhead .
“ One presumes that many of the specific results presented here have never been published in the open scientific literature , ” he wrote in the Preface to the book .
“ However , such results are based on well - known physical and mathematical models . ”
Far from implying that Brazil may have a clandestine nuclear weapons program , Brazilian Defense Minister Nelson Jobim said that the absence of official secrecy surrounding the book demonstrated that the opposite was the case .
“ The mere possibility of publishing this work in Brazil , and the material ’s free circulation , serve as eloquent proof of the non-existence of an unauthorized nuclear program in the country . ”
Dr. Barroso made the same point to Secrecy News .
“ My research is academic and has only scientific interest , for if it is not so , how could my book be published ? ”
“ I think the IAEA reaction was premature and exaggerated , ” he said by email .
“ There are no data in the book that were obtained in any kind of experiments or that were passed to me in secret . ”
“ A Física dos Explosivos Nucleares ” by Dalton E.G. Barroso , now in its second edition , was published by Livraria da Física ( 439 pages , 2009 , in Portuguese ) .

Bolt says he would be open to a challenge race against long - distance star Kenenisa Bekele of Ethiopia .
BRUSSELS ( AP ) 
Who is track 's greatest runner ?
Long - distance star Kenenisa Bekele wonders what it would be like to race sprinting great Usain Bolt " If Usain agrees , if someone wants to organize this , I am ready , " Bekele said Thursday , a day before the Memorial Van Damme Golden League meet .
Bolt , of Jamaica , is the reigning world and Olympic champion and world record - holder over 100 and 200 meters .
Bekele , of Ethiopia , is the reigning world and Olympic champion and world record - holder over 5,000 and 10,000 meters .
The idea would be to find a middle ground — between 600 and 800 meters .
" I think I am pretty good at 600 meters , " Bolt said last week .
Above 800 meters , he said , " I have no chance . "
Bekele also thinks the two could meet at about that distance .
" Six - hundred meters is a good chance for him , " said Bekele , considering he would lose too much over the first lap .
" I need some 800 meters , maybe 700 meters . "
A Bolt - Bekele showdown would be the biggest match race since 200 and 400 Olympic champion Michael Johnson raced 100 champion Donovan Bailey over 150 meters in Toronto after the 1996 Atlanta Games .
Johnson pulled up lame halfway through that race and the legacy of the event is more a joke than anything else .
Bekele 's manager , Jos Hermens , realizes that Bolt dominates the sport to such an extent that even a superlative performance like Bekele 's 5,000 - 10,000 double at the Olympics and worlds became merely a footnote .
" I will have to think about it this winter , " Hermens said , referring to a potential matchup .
He added that he will be in touch with Bolt 's manager , Ricky Simms .
Bekele is often overshadowed and he is still chasing the worldwide acclaim enjoyed by compatriot Haile Gebrselassie .
Bolt 's showmanship and stunning performances have made him one of the most marketable athletes in any sport .
When it comes to official performances , the two get no closer than the 400 for Bolt and the 1,500 for Bekele .
Bekele set a personal best of 3 minutes , 32.35 over 1,500 two years ago , a time that would make him the 13th best performer of 2009 .
Bolt 's top mark over 400 is 45.28 in 2007 , which would be the 28th fastest time of this year .

I 'm a big fan of Matt Asay 's writings about free software .
He combines a keen analytical intelligence with that rare thing : long - term hands - on experience in the world of open source business .
But even though I generally look forward to reading his posts , I have been rather dreading the appearance of one that I knew , one day , he would write ... because it would be wrong .
And now he has written it , with the self - explanatory headline : “ Free software is dead .
Long live open source . ”
Matt states in his first paragraph what the key issue is :
One of the most inspiring things I 've witnessed in my 10 - plus years in open source is its gradual embrace of pragmatism .
By " pragmatism " I do n't mean " capitulation , " whereby open source comes to look more like the proprietary world it has sought to displace .
Rather , I would suggest that the more open source has gone mainstream the more it has learned to make compromises , compromises that make it stronger , not weaker .
When I interviewed Richard Stallman in 1999 this is what he had to say on this subject :
The only reason we have a wholly free operating system is because of the movement that said we want an operating system that 's wholly free , not 90 percent free .
Open source exists because of a refusal to compromise by the creators of free software programs .
The “ pragmatism ” that Matt lauds is only an option for open source because the people who did all the hard work in creating free software refused to compromise initially .
Ten years ago , Stallman pointed out the dangers of compromise :
If you do n't have freedom as a principle , you can never see a reason not to make an exception .
There are constantly going to be times for one reason or another there 's some practical convenience in making an exception .
Compromise is a slippery slope : once you start down it , there are no obvious places to stop .
This plays right into Microsoft 's hands : its current strategy is to dilute the meaning of “ open source ” - classic “ embrace , extend , extinguish ” - until it becomes just another marketing buzzword , applied routinely , and ultimately with no real value .
So what ?
You may ask .
If , as Matt writes , the whole point is “ to go mainstream ” , then such blurring of the line separating free software from non-free software is surely a small price to pay to achieve that wider use of open source .
It might seem so in the short term , but I do n't believe it 's a wise strategy in the long term , even from a purely pragmatic viewpoint .
For example , current compromises that include working with Microsoft - developed technologies for which it may hold software patents in some jurisdictions mean that ultimately open source developers are giving hostages to fortune and undermining their power of self - determination in the future .
Moreover , if the term “ open source ” becomes devalued , coders and users will become disillusioned , and start to desert it .
The former will find the sharing increasingly asymmetric , as their contributions are taken with little given in return ( something that may well happen even to open source companies using the GNU GPL if they demand that contributors cede their copyright , as most currently do ) .
Users will similarly discover that some of these new - style “ blurred ” open source applications fail to deliver the promised benefits of control , customisation and cost - savings .
But , of course , the point is not “ to go mainstream ” : as Stallman said , it 's about having “ freedom as a principle . ”
Spreading free software is about spreading * free * software , not free * software * : software is simply the means , not the end .
This is what Stallman said a decade ago :
there are more important issues of freedom – the issues of freedom that everybody 's heard of are much more important than this : freedom of speech , freedom of the press , free assembly .
So why does Stallman even bother with free software ?
I do n't see how I could do something more important in some other area .
Stallman doggedly continues his crusade for freedom through free software because he recognises that that is where he can make the greatest contribution .
And because this is how he fights for freedom , without compromise , he is prepared to do and say things that people in the pragmatic world of open source find regrettable – shocking , even .
That 's partly because it inconveniently makes their job of “ going mainstream ” harder , and partly because of a genuine distaste for some of Stallman 's actions .
But what they overlook is that freedom fighters – for that is how Stallman regards himself – have always been so focussed on their larger goals that mundane matters like convenience and good manners tend to fall by the wayside .
Ultimately , the reason that free software cannot compromise is because we compromise over any freedom at our peril : there is no such thing as 50 % free .
As history teaches us , freedom is not won by “ going mainstream ” , but by small numbers of stubborn and often annoying monomaniacs that refuse to compromise until they get what they want .
The wonderful thing is that we can all share the freedoms they win , whether or not we helped win them , and whether or not we can live up to their high standards of rigour .
But equally , without their obduracy , their constant striving and their eventual victories we would all lose those freedoms , because they are only temporary , and must be constantly reconquered .
Specifically , without the fixed point of uncompromising free software , open source would soon mainstream itself into meaninglessness .

BBC security correspondent
The alleged bomber was a Saudi al - Qaeda fugitive Security and intelligence experts are deeply worried by a new development in suicide bombing , the BBC has learned .
It has emerged that an al - Qaeda bomber who died last month while trying to blow up a Saudi prince in Jeddah had hidden the explosives inside his body .
Only the attacker died , but it is feared that the new development could be copied by others .
Experts say it could have implications for airport security , rendering traditional metal detectors " useless " .
Last month 's bombing left people wondering how one of the most wanted al - Qaeda operatives in Saudi Arabia could get so close to the prince in charge of counter - terrorism that he was able to blow himself up in the same room .
Western forensic investigators think they have the answer , and it is worrying them profoundly .
The explosives , they believe , were detonated by mobile phone .
Prince Mohammed bin Nayef ( r ) was slightly injured in the attack Peter Neuman of Kings College London says the case will be studied intensively , and that there are " tremendous implications for airport security with the potential of making it even more complicated to get on to your plane " .
" If it really is true that the metal detectors could n't detect this person 's hidden explosive device , that would mean that the metal detectors as they currently exist in airports are pretty much useless , " he said .
The bomber was a Saudi al - Qaeda fugitive who said he wanted to give himself up to the prince in person .
The prince took him at his word and gave him safe passage to his palace .
But there , once he got next to his target , the bomb inside him was detonated .
Miraculously the prince survived with minor injuries , but footage emerging this week shows a sizeable crater in the concrete floor and the bomber 's body blown in half .
It is believed the force of the blast went downwards which is why only the bomber died .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
A spectacular superyacht has been designed by an internationally renowned urban planning architect in a very unusual shape .
The planned seventy - six meter long " Oculus , " which is designed for 12 guests , looks like a large sea creature , with one end looking uncannily like the jaw and eye socket of a shark or a killer whale .
A second design , the futuristic , 91 - meter " Infinitas , " is based on the figure - of - eight shape of an infinity loop .
The pair are the brainchild of Kevin Schopfer , a Boston , Massachusetts - based architect who felt the design of luxury yachts should move away from generic boat shapes to something more playful .
The two eye - catching designs , which include inside swimming pools and helipads , are still looking for someone to stump up the cash to pay for them .
With a starting price of $ 95 million for Oculus and $ 140 million for Infinitas , they wo n't come cheap .
But Schopfer has teamed with naval architecture firm Sparkman & Stevens to build more of the vessels .
" There are several potential clients interested in both Oculus and Infinitas and discussions are ongoing , " he told CNN .
" And we are also working on several more yachts . "
Have a look at more images of Infinitas and Oculus
Jon Ralston notes C Street influence may be keeping Ensign quiet
“ These men were the ones that said what we need to do is get Doug Hampton 's home paid for , and we need to get Doug Hampton some money .
We need to get his family to Colorado . ” -- Doug Hampton , former aide to Sen. John Ensign , “ Face to Face , ” 7/8/09
These men , these men of Christ , these men of C Street , these Family men who always preach morality and occasionally practice infidelity told Sen .
John Ensign in February 2008 to give his cuckolded aide money and help him relocate .
So Doug Hampton has asserted .
And Jeff Sharlet , who knows more about The Family than any outsider , thinks Hampton is telling the truth , and believes this conclave was grooming Ensign for greatness because of his telegenic presence and upward mobility within the Club of 100 .
“ I have no reason to disbelieve Doug Hampton , ” Sharlet , author of The Family : The Secret Fundamentalism at the Heart of American Power , said Thursday on “ Face to Face . ” “ When you go to a place like C Street , you become a member of what The Family in their internal documents call ‘ prayer cells , ’ an outlandish word , but that 's their term for it .
That 's what ( Oklahoma Sen. Tom ) Coburn and Ensign and ( Kansas Sen. Sam ) Brownback , all these guys ... what it is is a small , private meeting of like - minded men who believe that their prayers are better heard by God if they pray with men of equal status and power . ”
The Hamptons never made it to Colorado despite the apparent blessing of The Family .
But two months after that meeting at C Street , according to the senator , his parents gave the Hamptons $ 96,000 as a parting gift for their son ’s affair with Cindy Hampton .
The Hamptons settled into an expensive house in a tony Summerlin neighborhood , leading a quiet life until Doug Hampton forced John Ensign to publicly acknowledge the affair .
The issue of the payments – and Ensign has refused to provide any evidence that they occurred as he said they did – has become central to the scandal Ensign is trying to contain .
Hampton flatly asserted more than once on “ Face to Face ” that Coburn was there in the C Street room when Ensign was confronted about his affair .
There was a “ belief from Tom Coburn and many that some restitution needs to take place here , ” Hampton claimed .
After the Hampton interview , Coburn at first issued a mild chastisement of Ensign and then came forth with an assault on Hampton , essentially calling him a liar .
So based on Sharlet ’s experience and research on a group he describes in a book as hiding in plain sight in the corridors of capital power , with fealty to the Family above all else , whom does he believe ?
“ I think Hampton is telling the truth , ” Sharlet said .
“ I think one clue that Coburn might not be telling the truth is he then comes on and says , ' That guy 's lying , basically .
But , I 'm not going to tell you what really happened .
I 'm going to maintain this secrecy . ' ”
The question – or one of them – raised by all of this is whether The Family did not want to jeopardize its big plans for Ensign and decided to help him cover up the affair by suggesting he give the Hamptons some money .
Sharlet finds that perfectly within the outlines of The Family ’s behavior .
“ The Family , they have this idea that what they 're doing , that they 're called by God to do is to disciple politicians , is to help them get ready for prime time , ” he said on the program .
“ Take a politician who they believe is chosen by God for his position , and you polish that guy up . ”
That guy in this example is Ensign , whom Sharlet met once during his time researching The Family .
“ When you look at Ensign 's legislative record , it 's not terribly impressive , ” Sharlet pointed out .
“ He was a guy I think they appreciated almost more for his superficial qualities … .
He was not spoken of as an intellectual heavyweight within the Family .
I mean , there are ideologues involved with the Family .
I think Ensign was much more kind of the figure they liked to cultivate , who is indeed polished .
There 's no question of that . ”
Of course the polish has now rubbed off with the scandalous revelations .
And with every day Ensign remains silent , the tarnish gets blacker .
The senator is not being forthcoming about C Street and what went on or about those payments and whether he can prove they were gifts .
He ’s simply not talking .
Perhaps The Family and God have told him he does not have to .

Ron Paul has waged a heroic battle for financial sanity since the inception of his tenure in Congress ; and in End the Fed he gives us insights from that struggle available nowhere else .
Dr. Paul had an affinity for the free market from an early age .
" In the 1960s , " he tells us ,
I discovered the writings of economists such as Ludwig von Mises , F.A. Hayek , Murray N. Rothbard , and Hans F. Sennholz .
I gradually found the answers I had been searching for .
Even for the experts , it literally took centuries to fully understand the nature of money and the business cycle . ( p. 43 )
During his service in the Air Force , Dr. Paul was able to hear Mises speak , and when in Congress he met with Hayek .
" I had the pleasure of hearing Hayek lecture in Washington , around 1980 .
Following that meeting , we had a private dinner together and spent several hours visiting . " ( p. 51 )
But the principal economist who influenced him was Murray Rothbard .
Of all the Austrian economic greats of the twentieth century , I got to know Murray Rothbard the best .…
I recall his surprise when he found out I had read his essay " Gold and Freely Fluctuating Exchange Rates . " …
If there 's one book that the Washington establishment should read now , it 's Rothbard 's book America 's Great Depression .
In this book , he demonstrates that it was the Fed that created the late - 1920s boom that led to bust , and Hoover 's interventions that prolonged the Great Depression .
( pp. 57–8 )
The last remark begins to suggest a key reason that the Fed should be abolished .
Far from being a means to maintain monetary stability , as its supporters falsely insist , the Fed , through the expansion of bank credit , is the primary cause of the business cycle .
The expansion temporarily lowers the money rate of interest below the true market rate , largely determined by people 's time preference , i.e. , their preference for present over future goods .
Businesses , with money available , expand ; but the new projects cannot be sustained .
When the monetary expansion ceases ( if it does n't , we will have hyperinflation , with disastrous consequences ) , these new investments must be liquidated .
The process of doing so is the depression .
As Dr. Paul aptly remarks ,
The Fed can indeed provide liquidity in these times [ of credit contraction ] by a simple operation of printing more paper money to cover deposits .
But if you think of the cycle as beginning in the boom phase — when money and credit are loose and lending soars to fund unsustainable projects — matters change substantially . …
When central banks push down [ interest ] rates on a whim , the impression is created that savings are there when they are in fact completely absent .
The resulting bust becomes inevitable as goods that come to production can't be purchased , and reality sets in by waves .
Businesses fail , homes are foreclosed upon , and people bail out of stocks or whatever the fashionable investment is of the day .
( pp. 29–30 )
Instead of the Fed and its false claim that we need an " elastic " currency , we should instead remove government entirely from the creation of money .
In a free society , money would be a commodity ; most likely that commodity would be gold .
In fact , I 'm only observing reality : the idea of sound money in most of human history has been bound up with gold money .
Can there be sound money without a gold standard ?
In principle , yes .
And I 'd be very happy for a system that would permit markets to once again choose the most suitable money , whatever that turns out to be .
I 'm not for government imposing any particular standard : no central bank , no legal tender , no privilege for any commodity chosen as a backing for the currency .
( p. 71 )
Dr. Paul has presented the Austrian view of money in a succinct , accurate , and effective way ; but what justifies the claim that he offers insights available nowhere else ?
Are there not many excellent books and articles that explain the views of Mises and Rothbard on money ; not least the works of those two economists themselves ?
The answer arises from Dr. Paul 's many years of service in Congress .
In that capacity , he has had conversations with several Fed chairmen , and one of these conversations enables us to solve a mystery .
Alan Greenspan epitomizes the control of the money supply by government .
But is this not at first sight surprising ?
Greenspan was a follower of Ayn Rand and shared her devotion to laissez - faire capitalism .
In an essay written for the Objectivist newsletter , reprinted in Capitalism : The Unknown Ideal , Greenspan offered a strong defense of the gold standard .
The vital advantage of the gold standard , Greenspan explained , is that it prevents the government from manipulating the money supply :
In the absence of the gold standard , there is no way to protect savings from confiscation through inflation . …
The financial policy of the welfare state requires that there be no way for the owners of wealth to protect themselves .
This is the shabby secret of the welfare statists ' tirades against gold .
( p. 81 )
Greenspan , amazingly , told Dr. Paul " that he had just recently reread it [ the article ] and would n't change a word of it . " ( p. 86 ) .
How could Greenspan say this , while presiding over a system that embodies the government control of money that his article repudiated ?
Greenspan thought that he could conduct the financial system in the same way as the gold standard would operate .
I [ Greenspan ] think that you will find … that the most effective central banks in this fiat money period tend to be successful largely because we tend to replicate that which would have probably have occurred under a commodity standard in general .
( p. 88 )
In other words , we need to remove government from the money supply , unless , of course , I and people like me are in control .
Greenspan 's position brings to mind a Jewish tradition about King Solomon ; he thought that the restrictions imposed in Deuteronomy ( 17 : 16 – 17 ) on kings about wives and horses did not apply to him .
As the wisest of men , Solomon believed he knew the reasons for these restrictions , so he could avoid the temptations that the rules guarded against and take more wives and horses than allowed .
His overweening arrogance led to disaster , and Greenspan fell victim to the same syndrome .
Dr. Paul does not regard Greenspan as the wisest of the Fed chairmen he met .
" I had the most interaction with [ Paul ] Volcker .
He was more personable and smarter than the others , including the more recent board chairmen Alan Greenspan and Ben Bernanke " ( p. 48 ) .
For Bernanke , it is clear that Dr. Paul has a deep distaste .
He suspects that Bernanke has acted in secret to manipulate the price of gold , and he bristles at Bernanke 's refusal to disclose his operations to Congress .
So when Bernanke quickly refuses to give us information about the trillions of dollars of credit that he recently passed out in the bailout process because that would be " counterproductive , " he is really saying , " It 's none of your business . " ( p. 174 )
The book recounts remarkable conversations with others besides Fed chairmen .
When Ron Paul served on the Gold Commission in Ronald Reagan 's administration , he on one occasion flew by helicopter with the president to Andrews Air Force Base .
" Ron , " the president told me , " no great nation that abandoned the gold standard has remained a great nation . "
He indeed was sympathetic , as he was to many libertarian constitutional ideas , but he was also swayed by staff pressure to be pragmatic on most issues .
( p. 74 )
Reagan , it is apparent , could not break with the illusion that the government needs to be in control .
That illusion is avidly propagated by those who profit from it .
One such was the notorious George R. Brown , a longtime backer of Lyndon Johnson .
Brown displayed interest in Dr. Paul 's campaign for Congress in 1976 , and in one conversation told him ,
" Remember , for the economic system to work , business and government must be partners . "
I cringed and quickly scooted out the door .…
Once I was in office and after my votes and positions became known , the message was clear , and I never heard from him again . ( p. 159 )
Dr. Paul 's fight for freedom has not been confined to the issue of sound money .
He has also led the struggle against interventionist and imperialist foreign policy .
But the fight for liberty is seamless , and he shows that an aggressive foreign policy depends on government control of the money supply :
It is no coincidence that the century of total war coincided with the century of central banking .
When governments had to fund their own wars without a paper money machine to rely upon , they economized on resources .
They found diplomatic solutions to prevent war , and after they started a war they ended it as soon as possible .
( p. 63 )
The book contains an abundance of other arguments against our current monetary system , e.g. , that it violates the Constitution .
Readers will discover Thomas Paine 's poor opinion of paper money , and even how monetary debasement helped bring the Byzantine Empire to ruin .
Those who have absorbed the book 's message will come to a clear conclusion : End the Fed .

A team of scientists , including a noted UC Berkeley paleontologist , has discovered the tracks that one small pterosaur made as it landed on the muddy shore of an ancient sea sometime between 150 million and 115 million years ago .

Tiny tracks reveal pterosaur landed like a duck 1 / 3 Back to Gallery
They flew like ducks and they landed like ducks , but they were never like ducks at all .
They were flying reptiles called pterosaurs with long , sharp beaks and wings for soaring .
They lived in the days of their distant cousins , the dinosaurs , but evolved separately until they went extinct 65 million years ago - along with the dinosaurs and most other creatures of the time .
For the first time , a team of scientists , including a noted UC Berkeley paleontologist , has discovered the tracks that one small pterosaur made as it landed on the muddy shore of an ancient sea sometime between 150 million and 115 million years ago .
That gently sloping shore is now a broad stretch of flat rock known as Pterosaur Beach in a limestone quarry near the tiny village of Crayssac in southwestern France .
It 's so far off the tourist routes that it has no hotel or inn , so Kevin Padian , the Berkeley scientist who has studied pterosaur fossils for more than 25 years , and his French and Swiss colleagues slept at the local school while there to investigate the newfound tracks .
The scientists ' work is being published in the British journal called Proceedings of the Royal Society B .
Much is known about pterosaurs - think pterodactyls - and members of the extended tribe varied in wingspread , ranging in size from sparrow to fighter plane .
But until now it was not known how they landed after flying far in search of prey .
Padian has already determined from analyzing pterosaur fossil skeletons that they could run fast on their hind legs , and more slowly on all fours , with their clawed wingtips acting as front feet .
" These tracks , " Padian said , " tell us that this animal must have flapped its wings with its body upright , stalled in the air like many waterbirds do , and landed feet first just the way flying ducks like mergansers do today .
Then , its newfound tracks show this pterosaur took a few short , stuttering steps , turned slightly to its left , and there the tracks stop . "
The first prints of the landing show long claw marks made as the flier apparently dug in its hind feet to stop .
By the second step , two prints of the animal 's forefeet show up for the first time , according to the forthcoming report .
The French quarry holds hundreds of tracks made by pterosaurs as well as prints made by long - gone turtles , the ancestors of crocodiles and even dinosaurs .
Heavier animals probably stepped through the surface crust of the mud , and those prints were lost , Padian said .
More than 30 of the intact tracks showing the passage of lighter pterosaurs have been carefully analyzed , but only one - the first ever discovered - revealed the precious trackway of the pterosaur 's complete landing .
Its hind feet , the tracks show , were about 2 inches long , and the wingspread was about 3 feet , Padian said .
Although the discovery reveals much about the evolution of flight in the first vertebrate animals to reach the air , the scientists conclude that nothing in the tracks they have studied so far " provides any indication how these animals took off . "
Padian 's colleagues are Jean - Michel Mazin of the University of Lyon and the French National Center for Scientific Research , and Jean - Paul Billon - Buryat of the archaeology and paleontology section in the cultural office of the Canton of Jura in Porrentruy , Switzerland .
And this news could n't have come sooner , as in the very same issue of the NEJM , another paper reported that malaria found in Cambodia has become resistant to the most effective drugs used to prevent the disease .
The authors of that study believe that misuse of malaria medication gave the parasite the chance to evolve resistance .
They also warned that the spread of a resistant strain of malaria could be especially dire , seeing as the disease , even with all the preventative measures already developed , is the world 's third deadliest .
À propos the post Euan put up last July on Oil prices , Jean Laherrère sent The Oil Drum two interesting graphs on the relationship between the common currency and Oil .
These charts show very similar patterns in the rise of both Oil and the €uro against the Dollar , a clear sign that the record 147 $ / barrel had much to do with the weakness of the greenback .
Even after the economic crisis , this relationship seems to hold .
While the Oil price has definitely risen against the €uro these past few years , it has done so in a much less volatile fashion .
It is also interesting to note that since 2007 the correlation is stronger and since then the €uro seems to precede
Oil by a month or so in its movements against the Dollar .
In the three months since True Blood first aired in the UK , it 's been smashing viewing records in the States on a weekly basis , has turned its stars into tabloid staples and has given the vampire zeitgeist a much - needed grown - up twist .
If you missed it on the FX channel and skipped the illegal downloads , here 's the set - up : Six Feet Under creator Alan Ball is in charge and it's about vampires and sex , and sex with vampires , who now openly live among people and fight for their civil rights .
Series one centres on Sookie Stackhouse ( Anna Paquin ) , a telepathic waitress from Bon Temps , Louisiana , and her blossoming romance with Bill Compton ( Stephen Moyer ) , who 's a little old - fashioned about courting and affairs of the heart , since he became one of the pasty undead in 1868 .
There 's a lot of angst and sexual tension and will - they - wo n't - they and blah blah blah ...
But the show has bigger fangs than the rest , and woven into its trashtastic supernatural storylines is a hefty dose of funny .
That 's mostly down to Sookie 's job - incompatible , mouth - almighty best friend , Tara , and her drug - dealing , burger - cooking , road - paving , eyeshadow - wearing , redneck - bashing cousin Lafayette .
" People are crazy about it ! " marvels Rutina Wesley , who gets the pleasure of being professionally shouty as Tara each week .
" People are screaming and yelling at the TV !
They love this show . "
To Nelsan Ellis , who channels Lafayette with a deft swish and swagger , the popularity of his character was a complete surprise .
" I thought it would be the opposite , " he says , in a slow , considered drawl that 's much quieter and less cocksure than Lafayette 's rapid - fire wit .
" Lafayette is so risky , and he touches on a couple of different cultures .
These are taboo things , so I did n't know if I would offend anybody or if people would be upset with me . "
When he says " taboo things " , he means that as a black , gay man , Lafayette is an oddity on TV .
" In the black community , these things are frowned upon , " he explains , carefully .
" For it to be embraced by the black community , I was like , ' Oh , that 's surprising . ' "
You could argue that it is n't so surprising because there 's already a precedent .
Look away now if you do n't want to see the obligatory Guide reference to The Wire but Baltimore gangster Omar Little 's sexuality is incidental to his hugely popular character , because he 's written well and fleshed out .
The traits Lafayette shares with Omar are the ones Nelsan thinks make him so appealing .
" He 's a hustler , a survivor - he 's honest .
So I think whatever isms someone may have , they sort of lose or forget about it . "
Forgetting about it has n't been quite so easy for Nelsan himself , who grew up in Alabama with strictly religious parents .
" My mom 's side , they 're southern Baptist Christian .
My father is Church of God in Christ , so you know what that means , " he sighs .
" It 's hard dealing with them in terms of that .
My mother has n't seen a single episode .
Neither has my father .
They 'd find it too difficult . "
Nelsan 's scenes include screaming at an offensive redneck then throwing an " Aids burger " in his face , dancing in a gold thong in front of a webcam and introducing Sookie 's brother to the dangerous drug V ( vampire blood ) .
You can see why his family might want to avert their eyes .
More puzzling is the fact that Nelsan - who 's straight - is a devout Christian , even though True Blood regularly takes aim at the concept of organised religion in its portrayal of fundamentalist anti-vampire group The Fellowship Of The Sun .
So how does he reconcile his faith with working on a show like this ?
" That 's partly the problem my father has with me , " he explains .
" But I 'm an actor ... I empty myself out and fill myself with the character .
I would play a devil worshipper and I would fill myself up with whatever devil worshippers believe .
Then , as myself , I empty that out and become Nelsan . "
Rutina Wesley confounds expectations almost as much as Nelsan does .
In the show she 's a southern hothead with a troubled family life who can't hold a job down , mainly because she 's thrillingly rude to any customers unlucky enough to cross her path .
In real life , she 's friendly , chatty and excitable .
And two minutes into our phone conversation - she 's in LA , where she lives now , though she 's from Las Vegas - and we 're talking about The Vertical Hour , the David Hare play she was in on Broadway before True Blood , directed by Sam Mendes and starring Julianne Moore .
" There 's nothing like the theatre , " she says .
" That 's why I do what I do , to move an audience , and theatre is my favourite because it 's live . "
Such luvviness might come as a double surprise to those who know her from her starring role in dance flick How She Move .
But there 's a reason she mixes it up so much .
" It 's partly because I 'm an African - American actress , " she says , " and me not wanting to get pigeonholed or stereotyped .
So I made sure I trained in everything .
It 's not like , ' Oh you need dialect ?
Sorry , I did n't do that . '
It 's like , ' What accent do you need ?
Southern ?
Let me get my tapes . ' "
Nevertheless , some critics in the States have accused the show of stereotyping its black characters .
Newsweek 's Joshua Alston wrote that he was giving up on True Blood because " Tara and Lafayette take turns filling the role of the sassy black person who says what the audience would be thinking if the audience 's thoughts were quippier . "
The Guide puts that to Rutina , who explains the reaction to Tara in the States was initially far more negative , though people warmed to her as the first series went on .
She 's heard it all before and she 's quick to defend the writers .
" It 's not like they all sit around a table and go , ' How do the black people talk ?
I think they talk like this . '
They write characters and human behaviour .
And Alan Ball really has a handle on human behaviour . "
Nelsan is similarly dismissive and puts it all down to a kneejerk reaction .
" Black culture , when they see certain things like ' black woman loud ' , they immediately jump to the fact that it's one - dimensional , before they even watch the whole freakin ' season , " he says , before pointing out that Alan Ball is far too experienced to fall into that trap .
" To accuse him of doing that , one has to suggest that you 're absurd and you have no taste . "
Why , then , are n't there as many " I ❤ Lafayette " or " Team Tara " T - shirts as there are Bill - themed garments ?
Maybe their romantic stories are too messy and their everyday problems too real and ordinary .
True Blood needs that humanity to balance out all the saucy , gothic doomed love , but gritty realism is n't ever going to be the focus .
The solution ?
Turn both of them .
" Personally , I kinda wanted to be a vampire , " chuckles Rutina .
"
You get the teeth and to be cool and have cool clothes and be sexy all the time . "
Season three has already been commissioned : she might want to start avoiding silver and sunlight .
• True Blood finale , 10 pm , Fri , FX ; the series starts from the beginning on 5 Oct , 10 pm , C4
Nelsan on Lafayette
' He 's risky , he touches on different cultures '

BAGHDAD  Hours after his release from prison , the Iraqi journalist who hurled his shoes at former President George W. Bush said Tuesday that he had been tortured while in jail .
Not long after that , family members said , he fled the country in fear for his life .
“ Here I am free , and my country is still captured , ” said the journalist , Muntader al - Zaidi , during a news conference Tuesday at the television station where he had worked .
He said that he was beaten with pipes and steel cables , and that he received electric shocks while in custody .
He added that there were many who would like to see him dead , including members of unidentified American intelligence agencies .
Mr. Zaidi did not take questions after his brief remarks .
His brother Uday said that Mr. Zaidi flew to Greece , where he would receive medical and psychological care .
Part of the reason he fears for his life , his brother said , is that he plans to identify the people who played a role in his mistreatment , including high - ranking security officials .
and women ; at every turn , he openly defies her rule .
The contest starts as sport ( with McMurphy taking bets on the outcome ) but soon it develops into a grim struggle for the minds and hearts of the men , into an all - out war between two relentless opponents : Big Nurse , backed by the full power of authority ...
McMurphy , who has only his own indomitable will .
… ( more
He 's a boisterous , brawling , fun -loving rebel who swaggers into the ward of a mental hospital and takes over .
He 's a lusty , profane , life - loving fighter who rallies the other patients around him by challenging the dictatorship of Big Nurse .
He promotes gambling in the ward , smuggles in wine
I 've had suspicions for a long time , but nothing concrete that I could point to and say , " See ! "
It was just uneasy feelings .
We used to share a computer and one time I found a lot of gay porn links in the history while trying to recover a tab had accidentally closed .
I talked to him about it , but he said he had misclicked , and like I said , I had nothing really concrete to point to .
A couple days ago he was in the bedroom on his lap top , it was late , and he came out kind of in a rush and asked if I wanted one of those iced coffee drinks from Wendy 's because he wanted a frosty shake .
I said sure and he went off .
He was gone a long time .
Longer than would be normal , so I texted where are you ?
He texted back that he had gone a whole town over to the Starbucks .
It seemed odd to me because he had just scolded me about money and Starbucks by us is way more expensive than Wendy's .
But Starbucks was closed and he was going with his first choice , and he'd get me coffee at Wawa .
I reminded him he said Wendy 's and he got flustered and said he was getting a milkshake from Wawa .
It just felt off and I should n't have done it , I know , but I went to the bedroom and opened his lap top .
It was on and his gmail account was up .
He was exchanging e-mail with someone from craigslist , and they were discussing some meet up place with glory holes and stuff .
My husband was telling him he'd been going for at least 2 years and was happy there .
I was off by the time he got home and he handed me the coffee .
He did n't even have a milkshake himself .
It was weird .
The next day I ran his email name through google and he had used his e-mail name as his user name for a website where you advertise for quick hookups .
I do n't know what to do .
We have a young son together .
I 'm a stay at home mom and have n't worked in over 5 years .
I have no money because my husband has always said he works for the money so it 's his , and I get only what I need .
So I feel really helpless .
I know this is going on , but so what ?
I do n't seem to be in a position to do anything .
I 'm embarrassed and scared , and my chest hurts all the time thinking about this .
I have n't told anyone in my family because there 's so much going on right now like weddings and stuff and I do n't want to ruin anything , and a lot of them thought I was too young to marry and would be very much I - told - you - so .
What should I do next ?
Who should I talk to besides him ?
I do n't want to continue this marriage .
ifeelsostupid@gmail.com if you have advice too long for a comment .
My husband is cheating on me and has been for at least two years .
He does n't know I found out .
Now what ?
Holy Geezuss - roller - blading - in - a - tutu - christ .
The next gadget - ridden Iron Man movie looks absolutely amazing .
I mean , it would be amazing anyway just by the blinding presence of Pepper Potts alone , but these five minutes of footage have got me by my iron jewels .

Billions of light years , it turns out .
But they ought to be careful when to apply the brakes on the return trip .
Ever since cosmologists discovered that the universe ’s expansion is accelerating , many have wondered just how much this will constrain what we could see with telescopes in the future .
Distant regions of the universe will eventually be expanding so fast that light from any objects there can never reach us .
Likewise , dark energy – the mysterious force behind the acceleration – places a …
Is LSD Good for You ?
As the FDA paves the way for clinical LSD trials , scientists are exploring its medical benefits .
Is acid the new Xanax ?
Plus , from Angelina to The Beatles , a gallery of celebrity trippers .
Bob Wold does n't seem like your typical acid tripper .
A happily married 56 - year - old contractor with four kids who lives the suburbs of Chicago , he had never considered taking psychedelic drugs until about 10 years ago .
At the time , he was suffering from cluster headaches known as suicide headaches because they re so painful for 12 hours a day , and he was spending more than $ 20,000 a year on medication .
Then he read a post on a support - group Web site from someone who said theyd found a miracle cure for their own cluster headaches : LSD .
Wold decided to try it .
" Compared to brain surgery ,  he says , taking a couple hits of LSD looked a lot more attractive .
But ever since a bust of the countrys biggest LSD lab nine years ago , the drug has become much harder to find .
So Wold got his hands on the closest equivalent he could think of : psilocybin magic mushrooms ( though he has since switched to LSD , which he says works better ) .
The psychedelics arrived in a brown box at his doorstep from a long - distance dealer .
He took one dose : about 1.5 grams .
" In 15 minutes I could feel the difference ,  he says .
 My head was clearer than it had probably been in the past 20 years .
Other medications felt like they were just covering it up .
But on acid ,  All the pressure was gone . "

Using a powerful microscope , Karel Svoboda , a brain scientist at the Janelia Farm Research Campus in Ashburn , Va. , peers through a plastic window in the top of a mouse 's head to watch its brain 's neurons sprout new connections -- a vivid display of a living brain in action .
Ryan LaLumiere , a neurologist at the Medical University of South Carolina in Charleston , trains cocaine - addicted rats to suppress their craving -- a technique he says may help human addicts .
Elizabeth Kensinger , the director of a neuroscience lab at Boston College , uses an MRI machine to picture the brains of Boston College hockey players as they remember high points and low points from the hockey season -- the better to understand the effect of strong emotions on memory .
These are a few of the cutting - edge experiments that neuroscientists are performing in the latest efforts to understand the mysteries of how the brain learns , remembers and forgets .
The work is shedding new light on how the brain handles memory storage , loss , fear , addiction and aging .
Some explore the role of sleep -- even a brief nap -- in consolidating long - term memories .
Others are building colorful wiring diagrams , nicknamed " Brainbows , " that use different shades to show which neurons connect with which .
The human brain contains some 100 billion neurons that are connected by an elaborate network of tiny wires called axons and dendrites .
Neurons communicate by passing chemical signals from axons to dendrites at junctions known as synapses .
The sender neuron sends a chemical transmitter , called glutamate , across the synaptic gap .
The receiver neuron responds by firing a tiny jolt of electricity .
" The complex thoughts and emotions of our minds are generated in the brain by complex networks of such signal cascades , similar to the electric pulses in a computer , " T.S. Thorsen , a Danish researcher , said at the Society for Neuroscience 's annual meeting in Washington in November .
" The central mechanism by which the brain works is the release of a substance called glutamate from nerve ends , which is then sensed by neighboring cells , " Thorsen said .
The brain responds to life experiences by adjusting the strength of individual synapses and by changing the pattern of connections between neurons .
Scientists say this " plasticity " of the brain is the key to how animals and people learn , remember and forget .
Researchers are discovering how to track these changes .
For instance , Peter Serrano , a neuroscientist at the State University of New York in Brooklyn , found that a certain molecule , PKM - zeta , increases when a rat learns a memory task , such as how to find its way through a maze .
" For the first time , we can detect a molecular memory trace -- the persistent increased levels in PKM - zeta that last for a month after training , " Serrano told the neuroscience conference .
Much memory research is performed on mice , rats and other mammals because it 's often impossible to do such work on living humans .
Svoboda , the scientist who watched neurons make new connections inside a mouse brain , said the same thing probably happens in people when they learn a new skill such as typing or playing the piano .
Researchers are gaining new insights into various processes and problems of memory .
For example :
• Alzheimer 's disease :
Li-Huei Tsai , the director of the Picower Institute for Learning and Memory in Cambridge , Mass. , found a gene , HDAC2 , in mice , that she said is a prime target for a drug that could treat , or even reverse , the effects of Alzheimer's .
She was able to restore lost memories in mice that had been drugged to produce Alzheimer 's - like symptoms .
" This is exciting because more potent and safe drugs can be developed to treat Alzheimer 's and other cognition diseases by targeting this HDAC specifically , " Tsai reported in the journal Nature in May .
" The recovery of long - term memory ( in mice ) was really the most remarkable finding , " she reported .
" It suggests that memories are not really erased in such disorders as Alzheimer 's , but that they are rendered inaccessible and can be recovered . "
• Fear and other emotions :
Kensinger , the Boston College researcher , wrote that " emotion influences every phase of memory .
It affects where we direct our attention as we initially experience an event .
It influences how the event becomes solidified in our memories over sleep - filled delays , and it molds the ways in which the event is later retrieved . "
A recent discovery is the formation of " perineural nets , " networks of proteins surrounding neurons that make it hard to erase the memory of fearful events .
So far , these nets have been studied only in rodents , but researchers think they may apply to humans , such as soldiers suffering from post - traumatic stress disorder .
• Sleep :
Scientists have long known that sleep plays an important role in consolidating memories and transferring them to long - term storage in the brain .
" Not only do we need to remember to sleep , we need to sleep to remember , " said Robert Stickgold , a neuroscientist at Harvard Medical School in Boston .
Recent work by William Fishbein , a psychologist at City College of New York , showed that even " a brief daytime nap " improves memory .
College students who napped did better on a memory test than those who stayed awake all day , he said .

The Lotus F1 team has been awarded the 13th entry in the 2010 Formula 1 championship , the governing body announced on Tuesday .
The FIA said it had also received an " impressive " application from the BMW Sauber team , but given the uncertainty about the ownership of the Hinwil squad the governing body decided to give the entry to Lotus .
BMW was , however , given the " 14th place " in case any vacancy arises on the 2010 grid .
The governing body added the it will look into expanding the grid to 14 teams , " consulting urgently with the existing teams regarding the introduction of an appropriate rule change to expand the grid to 28 cars in time for the first Grand Prix in 2010 . "
As revealed by AUTOSPORT earlier this month , the Lotus entry will be backed a company called 1 M alaysia F1 Team Sdn Bhd , with Tony Fernandes as team principal .
Fernandes is the founder and CEO of the Malaysian - based Tune Group , owner of the Air Asia airline .
The FIA said Mike Gascoyne will be the team 's technical director and that Lotus will use Cosworth engines .
The company is a partnership between the Malaysian government and a consortium of Malaysian entrepreneurs .
The Lotus name will return to Formula 1 as a constructor for the first time since 1994 .
Lotus will be initially based at the RTN facility in Norfolk , UK , some 10 miles from the Lotus Cars factory .
The 50,000 square foot facility was originally built by Toyota for its initial Formula 1 programme and then used by Bentley for its Le Mans programme .
The team 's future design , R&D , manufacturing and technical centre will be built at Malaysia 's Sepang International Circuit .
The 22 - pound carbon fiber YikeBike is not only electric - powered , but it ’s also foldable , and unfolds in just 15 - seconds or less .
Expect this vehicle to hit stores in 2010 .
No word yet on pricing .

And while its pneumatic wheels may follow an old high wheeler configuration , this thing is designed to be easy to maneuver , and it ’s equipped with electronic brakes with built - in anti-skid system .
The feedback is coming in fast from the Federal Communication Commission 's request for a definition of broadband , and the message from big cable is clear .
The last thing it wants is a standard that defines ISP service by real - time performance .
" The Commission should continue to look at maximum advertised speed rather than some measure of ' actual ' speed , " advised the National Cable and Telecommunications Association in its response to the FCC 's call for input .
This counsel was prompted by an observation that the Commission made in its request for comments — that debates over defining broadband tend to focus on stated download and upload throughput .
" But neither is precise or diverse enough to describe broadband satisfactorily , " the agency noted .
" For example , advertised throughput rates generally differ from actual rates , are not uniformly measured , and have different constraints over different technologies " ( we 've got a feature on this issue here ) .
Define as delivered
The minimal requirements for broadband access can look very different , depending on the beholder .
And for disability rights groups , the baseline looks very different than it does for AT&T , or even most other public interest advocates .
Most of the public interest groups that have weighed in on this issue agree that this is a real concern .
" Any definition on broadband must be rooted in actual delivered speeds , because delivered speeds — not advertised speeds — influence the practical utility of the broadband connection , " counsels Free Press in its filing .
NCTA does not like this idea , arguing that it would be difficult to develop " a single figure that consistently and reliably describes the ' actual ' speed of all types of broadband connections for all purposes . "
Ditto says Comcast .
While the company writes that it shares the FCC 's concerns , " the actual online experience of any particular consumer at any particular moment in time involves a wide range of factors , many of which are outside the control of the Internet service provider . "
Given this , the cable ISP suggests that " the ' provisioned ' speed is still the most useful metric in evaluating whether any particular Internet service is ' broadband . ' "
Free Press acknowledges that the FCC can't be running around all day and night measuring the throughputs of ISPs .
" But it can establish a standard for classifying delivered speeds , " the group argues .
" We suggest that such a measure would be the bandwidth that service providers can be reasonably expected to deliver to end users on their own networks during peak - use times . "
It is what it does
But this sticky wicket is nothing compared to another question the FCC put to the public .
Should the agency take an " application - based approach " to defining broadband ?
In other words , does " broadband " get you a minimum , baseline suite of capabilities ?
For example , I 'm sitting here with a YouTube video review of the Blackberry Curve up on my Web browser , listening to the last .
fm radio service , while my e-mail app filters spam .
There 's an FTP client dormant in the background , and BitTorrent is seeding a few copyright - unencumbered files .
If I can't access one or more of these capabilities , do I still have " broadband " ?
Google argues that this is real concern .
" Ultimately what interests us about broadband is not what it is , but what it enables , " the search engine giant writes .
" Broadband should be defined to ensure that Americans have access to speeds that enable full utilization of broadband services and applications . "
And : " The FCC should further make clear that there must a sufficiently robust connection to permit users to receive , generate and interact with voice , data , graphics and video , which will enable users to receive the maximum value of broadband . "
Minimal meanings
AT&T begs to disagree .
Hold on here , the telco says in its filing .
The objective outlined by Congress in its Recovery and Reconstruction Act was to ensure that Americans in un- and underserved areas had access to broadband .
Sure , real - time voice , streaming video and other fancy stuff are no doubt part of the broadband experience .
" But for Americans who today have no terrestrial broadband service at all , the pressing concern is not the ability to engage in real - time , two - way gaming , but obtaining meaningful access to the Internet ’s resources and to reliable email communications and other basic tools that most of the country has come to expect as a given , " AT&T says .
" Fulfilling that need is the appropriate national priority at this time . "
Broadband must be defined in way " that ensures that the Act ’s goals are achievable — and that the services that are deployed are meaningful to the unserved citizens who sorely need them , " AT&T says .
So first , the FCC should define the " minimal set of applications " that Americans need to be integrated into the Internet economy .
And what are they ?
" For residential customers , that minimal set of applications should include the ability to exchange e-mails , participate in instant messaging , and engage in basic Web - browsing , " AT&T says .
" It also should include the ability to engage in Internet - based education programs , interact with Internet - based government services , and participate in online energy , healthcare , and public - safety programs . "
But the minimal requirements for broadband access can look very different , depending on the beholder .
And for disability rights groups , the baseline looks very different than it does for AT&T , or even most other public interest advocates .
Telecommunications for the Deaf and Hard of Hearing , Inc. argues that a definition of broadband will be pretty meaningless to folks with hearing issues if it does n't encompass access to Video Relay Services , Internet - based captioned telephone services , and Web - based video captioning .
" The inclusion of captioning , along with video description services for people who are blind , for video programming distributed over the Internet is expected to increase and become the norm , " TDHH writes .
" As such , broadband must be defined in a manner that enables these and other access features from the outset to ensure that people with disabilities have equal access to communication , video programming , media and information . "
Other public interest groups want the FCC to be cautious about this applications question .
The Center for Democracy and Technology wants broadband to be defined " to include unrestricted access to the entire Internet . "
But an applications - based approach should not be the " primary benchmark " by which the Commission defines broadband , CDT warns .
" Basing the definition of broadband on specific services available today could freeze expectations and disincentivize investment in improving networks . "
Ah , Ars longs for the happy , simpler days of , well , three weeks ago , when the FCC defined " basic broadband " as 768 kbps to 1.5 Mbps , and that was about it .
Now a whole lot of cats are out of the cyber-bag .
In any event , if you want to get in on this merry mess , you can upload comments to the FCC here ( the docket number for field 1 , " proceeding , " is 09 - 51 ) .
One procedural point : you can also weigh in on this question over at blogband.gov , and over 70 commentors already have , which is great .
But as blogband 's Moderation Policy page notes , " commenting in this blog is not a substitute for submitting a formal comment in the record of a specific Commission proceeding . "
So if you want your ideas included in the official public record , you still have to upload comments the old fashioned way .
Hopefully the FCC will soon make that easier too .
Previously I touched on what exactly the Page Cache does and outlined some of the improvements we ’re working on .
This post is geared towards web developers and is therefore even more technical than the last .
In this article I ’d like to talk more about unload event handlers , why they prevent pages from going into the Page Cache , and what can be done to make things better .
Load / Unload Event Handlers
Web developers can make use of the load and unload events to do work at certain points in the lifetime of a web page .
The purpose of the load event is quite straightforward :
To perform initial setup of a new page once it has loaded .
The unload event is comparatively mysterious .
Whenever the user leaves a page it is “ unloaded ” and scripts can do some final cleanup .
The mysterious part is that “ leaving the page ” can mean one of a few things :
The user closes the browser tab or window , resulting in the destruction of the visible page .
The browser navigates from the old page to a new page , resulting in the destruction of the old visible page .
The Page Cache makes this even more interesting by adding a new navigation possibility :
The browser navigates from the old page to a new page , but the old visible page is suspended , hidden , and placed in the Page Cache .
The Status Quo
Unload event handlers are meant to do some final cleanup when the visible page is about to be destroyed .
But if the page goes into the Page Cache it becomes suspended , is hidden , and is not immediately torn down .
This brings up interesting complications .
If we fire the unload event when going into the Page Cache , then the handler might be destructive and render the page useless when the user returns .
If we fire the unload event every time a page is left , including each time it goes into the Page Cache and when it is eventually destroyed , then the handler might do important work multiple times that it was critical to only do once .
If we do n’t fire the unload event when going into the Page Cache , then we face the possibility that the page will be destroyed while it is suspended and hidden , and the unload handler might never be run .
If we do n’t fire the unload event when going into the Page Cache but consider firing it whenever the suspended page is eventually destroyed , then we ’re considering the possibility of doing something that ’s never been done before :
Executing scripts that belong to an invisible web page that has had its “ pause ” button pressed .
There ’s all sorts of obstacles in making this work well including technological hurdles , security concerns , and user - experience considerations .
Since there is no clear solution for handling such pages the major browsers vendors have all come to the same conclusion :
Do n’t cache these pages .
How You Can Help
Web developers have a few things they can do to help their pages be cacheable .
One is to only install the unload event handler if the code is relevant to the current browser .
For example , we ’ve seen unload handlers similar to the following :
function unloadHandler ( ) { if ( _scriptSettings.browser.isIE ) { //
Run some unload code for Internet Explorer ... } }
In all browsers other than Internet Explorer this code does nothing , but its mere existence potentially slows down their user experience .
This developer should ’ve done the browser check before installing the unload handler .
Another way developers can improve things is to only install the unload event handler when the page has a need to listen for it , then remove it once that reason has passed .
For example the user might be working on a draft of a document so the developer installs an unload handler to make sure the draft gets saved before the page is left .
But they also start a timer to automatically save it every minute or so .
If the timer fires , the document draft is saved , and the user does n’t make any further changes , the unload handler should be removed .
Particularly savvy developers might consider a third option .
A Replacement For Unload
Some time ago Mozilla approached this problem differently by inventing a replacement for load / unload events .
The load and unload events are meant to be fired exactly once , and this is the underlying cause of the problem .
The pageshow / pagehide events – which we ’ve implemented in WebKit as of revision 47824 – address this .
Despite their name the pageshow / pagehide events do n’t have anything to do with whether or not the page is actually visible on the screen .
They wo n’t fire when you minimize the window or switch tabs , for example .
What they do is augment load / unload to work in more situations involving navigation .
Consider this example of how load / unload event handlers might be used :
< html > < head > < script > function pageLoaded ( ) { alert ( " load event handler called . " ) ; } function pageUnloaded ( ) { alert ( " unload event handler called . " ) ; } window.addEventListener(" load " , pageLoaded , false ) ; window.addEventListener(" unload " , pageUnloaded , false ) ; </ script > < body > < a href= " http://www.webkit.org/ "
>Click for WebKit</a> </ body > </html >
Click here to view this example in a new window , in case you ca n’t guess what it does .
Try clicking the link to leave the page then press the back button .
Pretty straightforward .
The pageshow / pagehide fire when load / unload do , but also have one more trick up their sleeve .
Instead of firing only at the single discrete moment when a page is “ loaded ” the pageshow event is also fired when pages are restored from the Page Cache .
Similarly the pagehide event fires when the unload event fires but also when a page is suspended into the Page Cache .
By including an additional property on the event called “ persisted ” the events tell the page whether they represent the load / unload events or saving / restoring from the Page Cache .
Here ’s the same example using pageshow / pagehide :
< html > < head > < script > function pageShown ( evt ) { if ( evt.persisted ) alert ( " pageshow event handler called .
The page was just restored from the Page Cache . " ) ; else alert ( " pageshow event handler called for the initial load .
This is the same as the load event . " ) ; } function pageHidden ( evt ) { if ( evt.persisted ) alert ( " pagehide event handler called .
The page was suspended and placed into the Page Cache . " ) ; else alert ( " pagehide event handler called for page destruction .
This is the same as the unload event . " ) ; } window.addEventListener(" pageshow " , pageShown , false ) ; window.addEventListener(" pagehide " , pageHidden , false ) ; </ script > < body > < a href= " http://www.webkit.org/ "
>Click for WebKit</a> </ body > </html >
Click here to view this example in a new window , but make sure you ’re using a recent WebKit nightly .
Remember to try clicking the link to leave the page then press the back button .
Pretty cool , right ?
What These New Events Accomplish
The pagehide event is important for two reasons :
It enables web developers to distinguish between a page being suspended and one that is being destroyed .
When used instead of the unload event , it enables browsers to use their page cache .
It ’s also straightforward to change existing code to use pagehide instead of unload .
Here is an example of testing for the onpageshow attribute to choose pageshow / pagehide when supported , falling back to load / unload when they ’re not :
< html > < head > < script > function myLoadHandler ( evt ) { if ( evt.persisted ) { //
This is actually a pageshow event and the page is coming out of the Page Cache . //
Make sure to not perform the " one - time work " that we 'd normally do in the onload handler .
... return ; } //
This is either a load event for older browsers , // or a pageshow event for the initial load in supported browsers .
//
It 's safe to do everything my old load event handler did here .
... } function myUnloadHandler ( evt ) { if ( evt.persisted ) { //
This is actually a pagehide event and the page is going into the Page Cache . //
Make sure that we do n't do any destructive work , or work that should n't be duplicated .
... return ; } //
This is either an unload event for older browsers , // or a pagehide event for page tear - down in supported browsers .
//
It 's safe to do everything my old unload event handler did here .
... } if ( " onpagehide " in window ) { window.addEventListener(" pageshow " , myLoadHandler , false ) ; window.addEventListener(" pagehide " , myUnloadHandler , false ) ; } else { window.addEventListener( " load " , myLoadHandler , false ) ; window.addEventListener(" unload " , myUnloadHandler , false ) ; } </script > < body >
Your content goes here ! </ body > </html >
Piece of cake !
How You Can Help : Revisited
To reiterate , we ’ve now identified three great ways web developers can help the Page Cache work better :
Only install the event handler if the code is relevant to the current browser .
Only install the event handler once your page actually needs it .
If supported by the browser , use pagehide instead .
Web developers that willfully ignore any or all these options are primarily accomplishing one thing :
Forcing their users into “ slow navigation mode . ”
I say this both as a browser engineer and a browser user :
That stinks !
The Plot Thickens
But now that we ’ve covered what savvy and polite web developers can do to help in the future , we need to further scrutinize the current state of the web .
Browsers treat the unload handler as sacred because it is designed to do “ important work . ”
Unfortunately many popular sites have unload event handlers that decidedly do not “ do important work . ”
I commonly see handlers that :
Always update some cookie for tracking , even though it ’s already been updated .
Always send an XHR update of draft data to a server , even though it ’s already been sent .
Do nothing that could possible persist to any future browsing session .
That are empty .
They literally do nothing .
Since these misbehaved pages are very common and will render improvements to WebKit ’s Page Cache ineffective a few of us started to ask the question :
What would actually happen if we simply started admitting these pages to the Page Cache without running the unload event handler first ?
What would break ?
Can we detect any patterns to determine whether an unload event handler is “ important ” or not ?
Our Experiment
You never know for sure until you try .
Starting in revision 48388 we ’ve allowed pages with unload handlers into the Page Cache .
If a user closes the window while the page is visible , the unload event will fire as usual .
But the unload event will not be fired as normal when the user navigates away from the page .
If the user closes the window while the page is suspended and in the Page Cache , the unload event handler will never be run .
What this means for users is that their navigation experience could be noticeably smoother and quicker in the common case .
What this means for developers is that we ’re consciously deciding not to run some of their code and their web application might break .
For users and developers alike – Please leave your feedback , observations , or suggestions in the bug tracking this experiment .
And remember this is just an experiment .
No one is planning to ship this drastic change in behavior in a production product .
But the Page Cache is such an important part of browser performance that we ’re willing to push the envelope a little to improve it a lot .
We want to learn what breaks .
We want to know if we can heuristically determine if an unload handler is truly critical or not .
We want to know if we can detect certain patterns in some types of unload handlers and treat them differently .
And , perhaps most importantly , we want to evangelize .
At least one popular Javascript library has already adopted some of the advice we ’ve given to help improve the landscape on the web .
If just a few more developers for popular sites or libraries take notice of this experiment and change their code then the web will be a much friendlier place for all of us .
Die Polizei hat in einer Pressemeldung ihre Darstellung zu dem Vorfall bei Freiheit statt Angst veröffentlicht .
Der fragliche Abschnitt lautet :
Im Zusammenhang mit der Überprüfung des Lautsprecherwagens kam es seitens mehrerer Teilnehmer zu massiven Störungen der polizeilichen Maßnahmen .
Trotz wiederholter Aufforderungen , den
Ort zu verlassen , störte insbesondere ein 37 - Jähriger weiter .
Die Beamten erteilten ihm schließlich einen Platzverweis .
Nachdem auch dieser wiederholt ausgesprochen worden war und der Mann keine Anstalten machte , dem nachzukommen , nahmen ihn die Polizisten fest .
Hierbei griff ein Unbekannter in das Geschehen ein und versuchte , den Festgenommenen zu befreien , was die Beamten mittels einfacher körperlicher Gewalt verhinderten .
Der Unbekannte entfernte sich anschließend vom Tatort .
Der 37 - Jährige erlitt bei seiner Festnahme Verletzungen im Gesicht und kam zur Behandlung in ein Krankenhaus .
Die genannte Überprüfung fand in der Linkstraße , also dem Ort des weiteren Geschehens , statt .
Ich habe dort bis zur ersten Festnahme keine Störung bemerkt .
Diese Festnahme fand laut Zeugenaussage während eines Interviews statt ( von dem Interview dürfte es eine Tonaufnahme geben , die das belegt ) .
Von einer massiven Störung kann also auch hier nicht gesprochen werden .
Der erwähnte 37 - Jährige ist wohl der Radfahrer .
Sein störendes Verhalten bestand darin , nach der ( in der Pressemeldung nicht erwähnten ersten Verhaftung ) eine Dienstnummer zu verlangen .
Anders als andere Personen kam er dem „ Platzverweis “ sehr schnell nach , wie auf dem Video erkennbar .
Dass „ der Mann keine Anstalten machte , dem [ Platzverweis ] nachzukommen “ , ist offensichtlich falsch .
Dieser Platzverweis bestand bsw .
darin , dass ein Beamter mir aggressiv entgegenschrie : „ Sie stellen sich jetzt besser nicht vor das Fahrzeug “ .
Auf meine Nachfrage wiederholte er die Aussage und schritt drohend auf mich zu .
Personen , die dabei waren die Straße zu verlassen wurden teilweise zur jeweils anderen Straßenseite geschubst .
In dem Fahrzeug befand sich die vorher Festgenommene .
Keiner der Anwesenden machte Anstalten , eine Gefangenenbefreiung zu versuchen .
Wie im Video teilweise am Rand sichtbar ist , waren die wenigen sich im direkten Umfeld befindlichen Personen damit beschäftigt , sich vor den Schlägen der Polizei zu schützen .
Auf meiner Seite des Geschehens befanden sich außer mir lediglich zwei Personen ( Bei dem Jugendlichen handelt es sich vermutlich um den Verletzten , später ebenfalls Festgenommenen , der andere Mann im weißen Hemd war etwas älter ) , die auf dem Boden lagen und geschlagen wurden .
Ich schirmte zuerst den einen , dann den anderen ab und half ihnen auf , bei dem Verletzten half wie im Video erkennbar ein Polizist .
Der Mann im weißen
Hemd lag völlig passiv auf dem Boden und schützte sein Gesicht mit einem Arm .
Von einer versuchten Gefangenenbefreiung war also auf meiner Seite nichts erkennbar .
Nicht erwähnt wird die spätere Festnahme des Verletzten , der laut Zeugenaussage ebenfalls um eine Dienstnummer bat .
Aktualisierung : Im Text „ Worum es geht “ kritisiere ich den Versuch , den Vorfall als individuelles Problem einzelner Polizisten darzustellen , was zur Zeit einige ( Lobo , Netzpolitik ) machen .
Aktualisierung : Die anwaltliche Vertretung des Opfers hat eine Stellungnahme veröffentlicht und bestätigt darin meine Darstellung weitgehend .
Aktualisierung : Der mit Nasenbluten ist der erste dem ich aufhelfe , aber nicht der , der später festgenommen wird .
USB -IF Sides With Apple , Spanks Palm in iTunes Synch Spat
The USB Implementers Forum , the industry group that oversees the universal serial bus standard , has finally responded to Palm ’s claim that Apple is “ hampering competition ” by repeatedly disabling the Palm Pre ’s ability to synch with iTunes–and it ’s not looking good for Palm .
In a letter submitted to Apple and Palm today , the group dismissed Palm ’s claim that Apple has violated its USB - IF Membership Agreement .
Worse , the Forum took issue with Palm ’s alleged use of Apple ’s vendor identification number , which it says violates USB - IF policy .
Palm ( PALM ) had argued that Apple ( AAPL ) , by issuing an update to iTunes that used the USB vendor ID number to prevent the software from automatically transferring content to any non-Apple USB device , had violated “ the letter and spirit of the USB - IF Membership Agreement , ” which is “ intended to facilitate interoperability between USB devices , not to regulate the content that flows between them . ”
But the USB - IF did n’t quite see things that way .
“ In the view of the USB - IF , Palm ’s allegation ( if true ) does not establish that Apple is using its Vendor ID ( VID ) contrary to the USB - IF ’s policies , ” the group said .
“ Therefore , under present USB - IF policies , the USB - IF does not consider the alleged use , without more , to be ‘ improper . ' ”
Ugly news for Palm , and it only gets worse –because the USB - IF goes on to suggest that Palm itself is violating its Membership Agreement by using Apple ’s vendor ID number to disguise the Pre as an Apple device .
From the USB - IF letter :
… Your letter also states that : “ Palm will shortly issue an update of its WebOS operating system that uses Apple ’s Vendor ID number for the sole purpose of restoring the Palm media sync functionality . ”

Maintaining a complex web application that uses a lot of Javascript for client - side , " AJAX " - style interactivity is rather difficult .
The clumsiness of the Javascript language itself , as well as the various tricks needed to make an application work consistently across multiple browsers , all of which must be wrapped up inside HTML , makes for a jumble of issues for the application developer .
Pyjamas is meant to ease that development , by allowing client - side applications to be written in Python , then translating that code to Javascript for use by the browser .
Pyjamas is a port of the Google Web Toolkit ( GWT ) , which pioneered the technique , but GWT uses Java instead of Python .
For developers who prefer Python , pyjamas provides an environment that almost completely insulates them from the code that actually runs in the user 's browser .
As described on the home page :
You can write web applications in python - a readable programming language - instead of in HTML and Javascript , both of which become quickly unreadable for even medium - sized applications .
Your application 's design can benefit from encapsulating high level concepts into classes and modules ( instead of trying to fit as much HTML as you can stand into one page ) ; you can reuse - and import - classes and modules .
Also , the AJAX library takes care of all the browser interoperability issues on your behalf , leaving you free to focus on application development instead of learning all the " usual " browser incompatibilities .
Essentially , a developer uses the pyjamas - supplied libraries that provide user interface widgets and Document Object Model ( DOM ) control from Python .
This code is then combined with a library that implements various Javascript language features in Python — an impedance - matching layer between the two languages called pyjslib — and turned into Javascript and HTML that can be loaded into a browser .
The pyjs program " translates Python code to Javascript by walking the Python abstract syntax tree and generating Javascript " .
But , using pyjamas is not at all like " normal " web programming .
As the web site and FAQ are quick to point out , pyjamas is not just another AJAX ( Asynchronous Javascript and XML ) framework , it is more akin to writing a desktop program that is translated into web application .
In fact , Pyjamas - Desktop allows the same code that is developed for the web application to be run , unmodified , on the desktop .
The same Python source that gets fed into the translator can , instead , be run , and , more importantly , debugged , on the developer 's desktop .
The tool is best suited to writing one - page web applications that rely entirely on AJAX techniques to do their job — things like Gmail , Mozilla 's Bespin , and many others .
Each page load in a pyjamas application requires loading all of the Javascript that makes up the application .
That includes code generated from the application as well as pyjamas libraries , so , ideally , that would only be done once .
That is quite a contrast from the traditional , multi-page - oriented web application , but is certainly in keeping with the direction of web interaction .
The key to understanding pyjamas is to note that , unlike AJAX frameworks , it is not meant to add a bit of interactivity , or some desktop - like features , to an existing web application .
Instead , the entire application is written in Python , likely debugged on the desktop , and then turned into a big blob ( or , really , blobs ) of Javascript for deployment .
The application code will look very familiar to Python GUI developers .
For example , the canonical " Hello World " program — which does a bit more than Kernighan and Ritchie 's original C program — looks like :
import pyjd # this is dummy in pyjs .
from pyjamas.ui.RootPanel import RootPanel from pyjamas.ui.Button import Button from pyjamas.ui.HTML import HTML from pyjamas.ui.
Label import Label from pyjamas import Window import pygwt def greet ( fred ) : print " greet button " Window.alert ( " Hello , AJAX ! " ) if __name__ == ' __main__ ' : pyjd.setup (" public/Hello.html?fred=foo#me " ) b = Button ( " Click me " , greet , StyleName='teststyle ' ) h = HTML ( "< b> Hello World < / b> ( html ) " , StyleName='teststyle ' ) l = Label ( " Hello World ( label ) " , StyleName='teststyle ' ) base = HTML ( " Hello from %s " % pygwt.getModuleBaseURL( ) , StyleName='teststyle ') RootPanel( ) .add(b ) RootPanel( ) .add(h ) RootPanel ( ) .add(l ) RootPanel ( ) .add ( base ) pyjd.run ( )
Running the build.sh script on that example , as described on the " getting started " page , creates output and public directories that hold the generated code .
There is a tiny bit of HTML and CSS , along with roughly 9,000 lines of Javascript that implement the example .
Much of that is likely boilerplate code to implement pyjamas itself .
A better example might be something like TimeSheet , which implements a more realistic application , and weighs in around 23,500 lines .
There are numerous examples on the pyjamas web page , many of which were ported from GWT .
Both the source code and the running application are available , so one can get a sense for how much code it takes to create the examples — as well as use them as templates for other applications .
There is quite a bit of documentation , though the FAQ would indicate that there have been complaints about that , on the site as well , including the in - progress Pyjamas Book ( which is implemented as a pyjamas book reader application ) .
The project has just released version 0.6 of the tool , with many new features outlined in the CHANGELOG .
There are some 140 changes from the version 0.5 , including a rework of pyjs to make more Python features available ( multiple inheritance and superclasses are specifically mentioned ) and bringing Pyjamas - Desktop into the standard distribution .
The pace of development is relatively quick ; 0.5 was released in March , and 0.6 adds quite a bit of functionality on top of that .
Pyjamas is definitely worth a look for anyone considering building a new - style web application , and who would rather use Python than Java .
Because GWT was released as free software , Pyjamas could leverage much of that work to give developers another language choice .
Writing — and worse , debugging — complex Javascript applications is a major chore , so any tools that make that easier should be quite welcome .
Those that just want a bit more interactivity in their existing web applications , though , might find the Pyjamas ( and GWT ) approach to be too heavy - handed for their needs .

Despite some pretty wild fluctuations in the price of oil , over the past week the price of gasoline has remained relatively flat at roughly $ 2.57 per gallon .
After starting the week at roughly $ 67 per barrel , the price of oil quickly shot up to $ 72 per barrel before ending the week at $ 69 per barrel .
Â
Fortunately these swings had little effect on the price of gas .
Today ’s price is down six cents ( 2 % ) from a month ago , and down $ 1.16 ( 31 % ) from a year ago .
Â
Given the current economic situation , the fact gas prices have dropped by nearly one - third since last year is certainly a very welcome relief .
Assuming this hurricane season is relatively mild and there are n’t any massive geopolitical flair ups , the price of gasoline should continue to decline throughout the fall and into the winter .
Aside from the price dropping due to decreased demand , refineries also stop producing “ summer blend ” gasoline , which has costlier additives that help with smog and pollution .
Â
This switch alone will help to decrease gas prices by 10 to 15 cents .
( On a side note : if there ’s gasoline that ’s just slightly more expensive yet is known to be better for the environment , why are n’t we using it all the time ? Â
Just a thought . )
Why You Ca n’t Help Believing Everything You Read
• Next article in this series : The Truth About Self - Deception • Previous article :
You should n’t believe everything you read , yet according to a classic psychology study at first we can’t help it .
What is the mind ’s default position : are we naturally critical or naturally gullible ?
As a species do we have a tendency to behave like Agent Mulder from the X - Files who always wanted to believe in mythical monsters and alien abductions ?
Or are we like his partner Agent Scully who was the critical scientist , generating alternative explanations , trying to understand and evaluate the strange occurrences they encountered rationally ?
Do we believe what the TV , the newspapers , blogs even , tell us at first blush or are we naturally critical ?
Can we ignore the claims of adverts , do we lap up what politicians tell us , do we believe our lover ’s promises ?
It ’s not just that some people do and some people do n’t ; in fact all our minds are built with the same first instinct , the same first reaction to new information .
But what is it : do we believe first or do we first understand , so that belief ( or disbelief ) comes later ?
Descartes versus Spinoza
This argument about whether belief is automatic when we are first exposed to an idea or whether belief is a separate process that follows understanding has been going on for at least 400 years .
The French philosopher , mathematician and physicist René Descartes ( below , right ) argued that understanding and believing are two separate processes .
First people take in some information by paying attention to it , then they decide what to do with that information , which includes believing or disbelieving it .
Descartes ’ view is intuitively attractive and seems to accord with the way our minds work , or at least the way we would like our minds to work .
The Dutch philosopher Baruch Spinoza ( above left ) , a contemporary of Descartes , took a quite different view .
He thought that the very act of understanding information was believing it .
We may , he thought , be able to change our minds afterwards , say when we come across evidence to the contrary , but until that time we believe everything .
Spinoza ’s approach is unappealing because it suggests we have to waste our energy rooting out falsities that other people have randomly sprayed in our direction , whether by word of mouth , TV , the internet or any other medium of communication .
So who was right , Spinoza or Descartes ?
How many years in jail ?
Daniel Gilbert and colleagues put these two theories head - to - head in a series of experiments to test whether understanding and belief operate together or whether belief ( or disbelief ) comes later ( Gilbert et al. , 1993 ) .
In their classic social psychology experiment seventy - one participants read statements about two robberies then gave the robber a jail sentence .
Some of the statements were designed to make the crime seem worse , for example the robber had a gun , and others to make it look less serious , for example the robber had starving children to feed .
The twist was that only some of the statements were true , while others were false .
Participants were told that all the statements that were true would be displayed in green type , while the false statement would be in red .
Here ’s the clever bit : half the participants where purposefully distracted while they were reading the false statements while the other half were n’t .
In theory if Spinoza was correct then those who were distracted while reading the false statements would n’t have time to process the additional fact that the statement was written in red and therefore not true , and consequently would be influenced by it in the jail term they gave to the criminal .
On the other hand if Descartes was right then the distraction would make no difference as participants would n’t have time to believe or not believe the false statements so they would n’t make any difference to the jail term .
And the winner is …
The results showed that when the false statements made the crime seem much worse rather than less serious , the participants who were interrupted gave the criminals almost twice as long in jail , up from about 6 years to around 11 years .
By contrast the group in which participants had n’t been interrupted managed to ignore the false statements .
Consequently there was no significant difference between jail terms depending on whether false statements made the crime seem worse or less serious .
This meant that only when given time to think about it did people behave as though the false statements were actually false .
On the other hand , without time for reflection , people simply believed what they read .
Gilbert and colleagues carried out further experiments to successfully counter some alternative explanations of their results .
These confirmed their previous findings and led them to the rather disquieting conclusion that Descartes was in error and Spinoza was right .
Believing is not a two - stage process involving first understanding then believing .
Instead understanding is believing , a fraction of a second after reading it , you believe it until some other critical faculty kicks in to change your mind .
We really do want to believe , just like Agent Mulder .
Believe first , ask questions later
Not only that , but their conclusions , and those of Spinoza , also explain other behaviours that people regularly display :
Correspondence bias : this is people ’s assumption that others ’ behaviour reflects their personality , when really it reflects the situation .
Truthfulness bias : people tend to assume that others are telling the truth , even when they are lying .
The persuasion effect : when people are distracted it increases the persuasiveness of a message .
Denial - innuendo effect : people tend to positively believe in things that are being categorically denied .
Hypothesis testing bias : when testing a theory , instead of trying to prove it wrong people tend to look for information that confirms it .
This , of course , is n’t very effective hypothesis testing !
When looked at in light of Spinoza ’s claim that understanding is believing , these biases and effects could result from our tendency to believe first and ask questions later .
Take the correspondence bias : when meeting someone who is nervous we may assume they are a nervous person because this is the most obvious inference to make .
It only occurs to us later that they might have been worried because they were waiting for important test results .
If all this is making your feel rather uncomfortable then you ’re not alone .
Gilbert and colleagues concede that our credulous mentality seems like bad news .
It may even be an argument for limiting freedom of speech .
After all , if people automatically believe everything they see and hear , we have to be very careful about what people see and hear .
Benefits of belief
Gilbert and colleagues counter this by arguing that too much cynicism is not a good thing .
Minds working on a Decartian model would only believe things for which they had hard evidence .
Everything else would be neither believed or not believed , but in a state of limbo .
The problem is that a lot of the information we are exposed to is actually true , and some of it is vital for our survival .
If we had to go around checking our beliefs all the time , we ’d never get anything done and miss out on some great opportunities .
Minds that work on a Spinozan model , however , can happily believe as a general rule of thumb , then check out anything that seems dodgy later .
Yes , they will often believe things that are n’t true , but it ’s better to believe too much and be caught out once in a while than be too cynical and fail to capitalise on the useful and beneficial information that is actually true .
Or maybe by going along with this argument I ’m being gullible and the harsh truth is that it ’s a basic human failing that we are all too quick to take things at face value and too slow to engage our critical faculties .
I ’ll leave you to ponder that one .
Cyber security is a real issue , as evidenced by the virus behind July 4 cyber attacks that hobbled government and business websites in the United States and South Korea .
It originated from Internet provider addresses in 16 countries and targeted , among others , the White House and the New York Stock Exchange .
Unfortunately , the Obama administration has chosen to combat it in a move that runs counter to its pledge to be transparent .
The administration reportedly is proceeding with a Bush - era plan to use the National Security Agency to screen government computer traffic on private - sector networks .
AT&T ; is slated to be the likely test site .
This classified pilot program , dubbed “ Einstein 3 , ” is developed but not yet rolled out .
It takes two offenders from President Bush ’s contentious secret surveillance program and puts them in charge of scrutinizing all Internet traffic going to or from federal government agencies .
Despite its name , the Einstein 3 program is more genie than genius -- an omnipotent force ( run by the NSA via AT&T ; 's “ secret rooms ” ) that does the government ’s bidding -- spying .
The last time around , this sort of scheme was known as the “ special access ” program -- “ special ” being code for “ unconstitutional . ”
Einstein 3 purportedly is meant to protect government networks from hackers .
But cyber - security experts -- such as Babak Pasdar , who blew the whistle on a mysterious “ Quantico Circuit ” while working for a major service provider -- agree that Einstein 3 offers no intrinsic security value .
The program is implemented where servers exchange traffic between one another -- in the heart of a network system rather than at the perimeter , which interfaces with the outside world .
This is similar to a home security system that only monitors the central interior of a house , rather than keeping an eye on the actual doors ( and the purpose of hackers may simply be to enter ) .
Advertisement
Furthermore , Einstein 3 focuses on collecting , processing and analyzing all person - to - person communications content rather than looking for hacker and malicious software attack patterns directed at government sites and installations -- which should raise eyebrows .
The prospect of NSA involvement in secret surveillance should set off alarm bells .
The intelligence community lost any benefit of the doubt the last time it collected and read Americans ’ domestic e-mail messages without court warrants .
Einstein 3 is based primarily on covert technologies developed by the NSA for the purposes of wiretapping .
The telecom companies also have lost their privacy cred .
In a tacit admission that the proposed new program is problematic and possibly illegal , AT&T ; has sought written assurances from the administration that it will not be legally liable for participating in the program .
The company was sued over its role in aiding Bush ’s electronic eavesdropping on Americans and , along with other telecoms , received retroactive immunity from Congress .
Earlier incarnations of the Einstein program observe predetermined signatures ( specific patterns of network traffic ) , but Einstein 3 would look at the content of e-mails and other messages sent over government systems .
Advertisement
Moreover , while Einstein 1 and Einstein 2 passively observe information , Einstein 3 technology plans to use “ active sensors . ”
This is a tactic used by malware developers and is a popular feature of spyware that clogs up the Internet , slows down PCs and tips off hackers by emitting signals .
And most disturbingly , according to the Department of Homeland Security ’s 2008 “ Privacy Impact Assessment , ” while earlier iterations of Einstein implemented signatures based on malicious computer codes , Einstein 3 could include signatures based on personally identifiable information .
The privacy implications are great .
Any citizen logging on to a " .gov ” website would trigger this .
The IRS and other governmental agencies collect sensitive personal information for legitimate and limited purposes .
However , strict confidentiality rules apply to that information .
Although the Department of Homeland Security , which is managing the program , insists that the “ main focus is to identify malicious code , ” we ’ve heard such empty reassurances before .
Media reports indicate that government officials recently acknowledged during closed meetings of the House and Senate Intelligence and Judiciary committees that Americans ’ e-mails that were improperly gathered or read during Bush ’s warrantless wiretapping program -- even under the relaxed 2008 intelligence surveillance law -- were not just an “ incidental byproduct . ”
According to a former NSA analyst and two intelligence analysts interviewed by the New York Times , the e-mails could number in the millions .
Advertisement
Further , a government review of the Bush wiretapping program , released Friday , questioned the effectiveness of the surveillance efforts .
President Obama ’s federalization of many private systems and his adoption of the Bush administration ’s spying tactics are on a collision course that would expose many Americans ’ private data and communications to government scrutiny .
I suspect that the public would be appalled that a taxpayer ’s financial information or a patient ’s medical records would be available to , much less perused by , the NSA .
There are far less invasive network defenses that can secure government computing environments , such as upgrading good old - fashioned firewalls and filtering routers .
Obama came into office vested with vast new surveillance powers , which he voted for as a senator .
Atty . Gen. Eric H. Holder Jr. , while strenuously avoiding the word “ illegal , ” called the original Bush snooping “ unwise . ”
But instead of trying to put the genie back in the bottle , Obama is considering expanding its power .
This is antithetical to basic civil liberties and privacy protections that are the core of a democratic society .
Perhaps we can draw a lesson from the real Einstein , who ultimately regretted his role in urging the development of dangerous technology -- the atomic bomb -- and spent the rest of his life advocating against it .
Now that their reach has been extended , they are likely to be more difficult to stub out
A Survey USA poll taken in Fresno , CA asked respondents four questions about the speech .
Overwhelming majorities expressed favorable opinions .
Q : President Obama plans to deliver a national address to school children on the importance of them taking responsibility for their own success in school .
Do you think it is appropriate ?
Or not appropriate ?
For President Obama to deliver this address ?
A : Appropriate 63 % Not Appropriate 30 % Q : Do you think it would be appropriate ?
Or not appropriate ?
For ANY President to deliver this address ?
A : Appropriate 64 % Not Appropriate 30 % Q : If you had a child attending a school that was going to show the address , would you tell your child to pay attention ?
Would you tell you child to NOT pay attention ?
Or would you keep your child home ?
A : To Pay Attention 78 % To NOT Pay Attention 5 % Would Keep Child Home 14 % Q : Who should decide whether to show President Obama 's national address to school children ?
School districts ?
Or individual teachers ?
A : School Districts 52 % Individual Teachers 28 %
SUSA asked the same questions of residents in Missouri with almost identical results .
Q : President Obama plans to deliver a national address to school children on the importance of them taking responsibility for their own success in school .
Do you think it is appropriate ?
Or not appropriate ?
For President Obama to deliver this address ?
A : Appropriate 63 % Not Appropriate 33 % Q : Do you think it would be appropriate ?
Or not appropriate ?
For ANY President to deliver this address ?
A : Appropriate 65 % Not Appropriate 29 % Q : If you had a child attending a school that was going to show the address , would you tell your child to pay attention ?
Would you tell you child to NOT pay attention ?
Or would you keep your child home ?
A : To Pay Attention 70 % To NOT Pay Attention 4 % Would Keep Child Home 21 % Q : Who should decide whether to show President Obama 's national address to school children ?
School districts ?
Or individual teachers ?
A : School Districts 57 % Individual Teachers 23 %
In each case , twice as many people say the speech is " appropriate " as those who say it is not .
In Missouri , nearly three - quarters of respondents say they would want their children to " pay attention " to the president 's message on the importance of education .
In Fresno , nearly four out of five people say so .
In Missouri , only about one out of five * people would take the extreme step of keeping their children out of school the day of the president 's speech .
In Fresno , fewer than 3 in 20 would do so .
Empirical data demonstrate that Americans support the idea of the President of the United States encouraging children to stay in school and get an education .
This is , by an overwhelming majority , the mainstream view .
However , as with the health - reform debate , the media are amplifying the protestations of a fringe minority , lending them credence by virtue of nothing more than their volume .

A Concurrent ML Library in Concurrent Haskell
Avik Chaudhuri
Edinburgh , Scotland , 31st August - 2nd September 2009
Abstract
In Concurrent ML , synchronization abstractions can be defined and passed as values , much like functions in ML .
This mechanism admits a powerful , modular style of concurrent programming , called \emph{higher - order concurrent programming} .
Unfortunately , it is not clear whether this style of programming is possible in languages such as Concurrent Haskell , that support only first - order message passing .
Indeed , the implementation of synchronization abstractions in Concurrent ML relies on fairly low - level , language - specific details .
In this paper we show , constructively , that synchronization abstractions can be supported in a language that supports only first - order message passing .
Specifically , we implement a library that makes Concurrent ML - style programming possible in Concurrent Haskell .
We begin with a core , formal implementation of synchronization abstractions in the $ \pi$ - calculus .
Then , we extend this implementation to encode all of Concurrent ML 's concurrency primitives ( and more ! ) in Concurrent Haskell .
Our implementation is surprisingly efficient , even without possible optimizations .
Preliminary experiments suggest that our library can consistently outperform OCaml 's standard library of Concurrent ML - style primitives .
At the heart of our implementation is a new distributed synchronization protocol that we prove correct .
Unlike several previous translations of synchronization abstractions in concurrent languages , we remain faithful to the standard semantics for Concurrent ML 's concurrency primitives .
For example , we retain the symmetry of {\tt choose} , which can express selective communication .
As a corollary , we establish that implementing selective communication on distributed machines is no harder than implementing first - order message passing on such machines .

HAWTHORNE , California – Building a successful startup in Silicon Valley is hard , but it ’s not rocket science .
Unless you ’re SpaceX .
Eschewing the traditional startup trappings of two college grads eating ramen , watching Adult Swim and coding until the wee hours of the night , SpaceX instead employs hundreds of brainiacs and builds its rockets in a massive hangar that once housed a 747 fuselage factory .
Started in 2002 by PayPal founder Elon Musk , SpaceX ( short for Space Exploration Technologies Corporation ) brings a startup mentality to launching rockets into orbit , which until recently was almost exclusively government turf .
The hope is that minimal bureaucracy , innovation and in - house manufacturing and testing can be used to put payloads into space at roughly one - tenth the cost of traditional methods .
If the company ’s newest rocket , the Falcon 9 , successfully completes its two scheduled launches this year , it will rendezvous with the International Space Station in 2010 .
After that , it will officially begin its mission as NASA ’s Commercial Orbital Transportation Services platform , replacing the space shuttle as the method for transporting cargo and crew to the ISS .
SpaceX launched its first rocket , the Falcon 1 , last September , placing a dummy payload into orbit .
Space enthusiasts are holding their breath to see how Falcon 9 performs .
Here ’s a behind - the - scenes look at SpaceX ’s facility .
This is how the private sector builds a rocket capable of space travel .
Looking less like a lab full of rocket scientists and more like Google , SpaceX foregoes offices and private meeting rooms .
Instead the company opts for an open floor plan and glass - paneled conference rooms .
Do n’t be fooled , those are rocket scientists .

Later this year , SpaceX will launch its much larger Falcon 9 rocket .
If all goes well , the craft will make several orbits around the Earth before splashing down off the California coast .
If the mission is a success , a commercial payload will be launched before the end of 2009 .
The Falcon 9 ’s capsule , Dragon , is designed to carry cargo and astronauts to the International Space Station for NASA .
An engineering model of the SpaceX ’s capsule , Dragon , is used to test configurations of the craft .

SpaceX uses a high - tech , strong and lightweight aluminum - lithium alloy with a rigid internal structure in the construction of its Falcon 1 rocket .
The lighter the rocket , the heavier the payload can be .

Much larger than the Falcon 1 , the Falcon 9 first stage , right , is ready for its end cap to be attached ( see bottom photo ) .
The first and second stages of the Falcon 9 , left and right respectively in top photo , are nearly identical , with the second stage being a shorter version of the first .
The domes and walls of the stages are made with a superstrong aluminum - lithium alloy .
The end caps are covered with a special heat shielding designed to protect the stages upon reentry so they can be recovered and reused .

Several rocket motors sit waiting to attached to Falcon rockets or test platforms , but first they will need to be assembled .
The stand in the photo below supports the rocket motor during the assembly process .
These motors take the propellant and focus it in the right direction .
They ’re right where all those impressive flames shoot out at launch .
The special shape creates the huge amount of thrust that gets the rocket into space .

Machinists in the SpaceX shop use computerized mills and lathes to form raw chunks of exotic alloys into working rocket parts .
In the top photo , a machinist inspects a small part he is drilling with a computerized mill .
Another machinist waits for a robotic press to finish shaping what appears to be a fuel tank fairing , as seen in slide 6 .
A rocket motor is being formed in a milling machine .
The hoses hanging from the door are used to lubricate the bit and wash away slivers of metal the mill removes .
A robotic drill press cuts precise , computer - guided holes into a block of metal that will soon find its way into a rocket .

NAME
Proc:: Daemon - Run Perl program(s ) as a daemon process .
SYNOPSIS
use Proc:: Daemon ; $ daemon = Proc:: Daemon->new ( work_dir => '/my/daemon/directory ' , ..... ) ; $ Kid_1 _PID = $ daemon -> Init ; unless ( $ Kid_1 _PID ) { # code executed only by the child ... } $ Kid_2_PID = $ daemon-> Init( { work_dir => '/other/daemon/directory ' , exec_command => ' perl /home/my_script.pl ' , } ) ; $ pid = $ daemon -> Status ( ... ) ; $ stopped = $ daemon->Kill_Daemon ( ... ) ;
DESCRIPTION
This module can be used by a Perl program to initialize itself as a daemon or to execute ( exec ) a system command as daemon .
You can also check the status of the daemon ( alive or dead ) and you can kill the daemon .
A daemon is a process that runs in the background with no controlling terminal .
Generally servers ( like FTP , HTTP and SIP servers ) run as daemon processes .
Do not make the mistake to think that a daemon is a server . ;-)
Proc:: Daemon does the following :
The script forks a child .
The child changes the current working directory to the value of ' work_dir ' .
The child clears the file creation mask .
The child becomes a session leader , which detaches the program from the controlling terminal .
The child forks another child ( the final daemon process ) .
This prevents the potential of acquiring a controlling terminal at all and detaches the daemon completely from the first parent .
The second child closes all open file descriptors ( unless you define dont_close_fh and / or dont_close_fd ) .
The second child opens STDIN , STDOUT and STDERR to the location defined in the constructor ( new ) .
The second child returns to the calling script , or the program defined in ' exec_command ' is executed and the second child never returns .
The first child transfers the PID of the second child ( daemon ) to the parent .
Additionally the PID of the daemon process can be written into a file if ' pid_file ' is defined .
Then the first child exits .
If the parent script is looking for a return value , then the PID (s ) of the child / ren will be returned .
Otherwise the parent will exit .
NOTE : Because of the second fork the daemon will not be a session - leader and therefore Signals will not be send to other members of his process group .
If you need the functionality of a session - leader you may want to call POSIX : : setsid ( ) manually at your daemon .
INFO : Since fork is not performed the same way on Windows systems as on Linux , this module does not work with Windows .
Patches appreciated !
CONSTRUCTOR
new ( % ARGS )
The constructor creates a new Proc : : Daemon object based on the hash %ARGS .
The following keys from %ARGS are used : work_dir Defines the path to the working directory of your daemon .
Defaults to / .
setuid
Sets the real user identifier ( $< ) and the effective user identifier ( $ > ) for the daemon process using POSIX :: setuid ( ... ) , in case you want to run your daemon under an other user than the parent .
Obviously the first user must have the rights to switch to the new user otherwise it will stay the same .
It is helpful to define the argument setuid if you start your script at boot time by init with the superuser , but wants the daemon to run under a normal user account .
setgid
Sets the real group identifier ( $ ( ) and the effective group identifier ( $ ) ) for the daemon process using POSXI :: setgid ( ... ) , just like setuid .
As with setuid , the first user must have the rights to switch to the new group , otherwise the group id will not be changed .
child_STDIN
Defines the path to STDIN for your daemon .
Defaults to / dev/null .
Default Mode is ' < ' ( read ) .
You can define other Mode the same way as you do using Perls open in a two - argument form .
child_STDOUT
Defines the path where the output of your daemon will go .
Defaults to / dev/null .
Default Mode is '+ >' ( write / read ) .
You can define other Mode the same way as you do using Perls open in a two - argument form .
child_STDERR
Defines the path where the error output of your daemon will go .
Defaults to / dev/null .
Default Mode is '+ >' ( write / read ) .
You can define other Mode the same way as you do using Perls open in a two - argument form , see example below .
dont_close_fh
If you define it , it must be an arrayref with file handles you want to preserve from the parent into the child ( daemon ) .
This may be the case if you have code below a __DATA__ token in your script or module called by use or require .
dont_close_fh => [ ' main :: DATA ' , ' PackageName :: DATA ' , $ my_filehandle , ... ] ,
You can add any kind of file handle to the array ( expression in single quotes or a scalar variable ) , including ' STDIN ' , ' STDOUT ' and ' STDERR ' .
Logically the path settings from above ( child_STDIN , ... ) will be ignored in this case .
DISCLAIMER : Using this argument may not detach your daemon fully from the parent !
Use it at your own risk .
dont_close_fd
Same function and disclaimer as dont_close_fh , but instead of file handles you write the numeric file descriptors inside the arrayref .
pid_file Defines the path to a file ( owned by the parent user ) where the PID of the daemon process will be stored .
Defaults to undef ( = write no file ) .
file_umask Defines umask for pid_file , child_STDIN , child_STDOUT and child_STDERR files .
Defaults to 066 ( other users may not modify or read the files ) .
exec_command Scalar or arrayref with system command (s ) that will be executed by the daemon via Perls exec PROGRAM_LIST .
In this case the child will never return to the parents process !
Example : my $ daemon = Proc:: Daemon->new ( work_dir => '/working/daemon/directory ' , child_STDOUT => '/ path/to/daemon/output.file ' , child_STDERR => '+>> debug.txt ' , pid_file => ' pid.txt ' , exec_command => ' perl /home/my_script.pl ' , # or : # exec_command => [ ' perl /home/my_script.pl ' , ' perl /home/my_other_script.pl ' ] , ) ;
In this example : the PID of the daemon will be returned to $ daemon in the parent process and a pid-file will be created at / working / daemon / directory / pid.txt .
STDOUT will be open with Mode '+ >' ( write / read ) to / path/to/daemon/output.file and STDERR will be open to / working / daemon / directory / debug.txt with Mode '+ >>' ( write / read opened for appending ) .
the script / home / my_script.pl will be executed by perl and run as daemon .
Therefore the child process will never return to this parent script .
METHODS
Init ( [ { %ARGS } ] )
Become a daemon .
If used for the first time after new , you call Init with the object reference to start the daemon .
$ pid = $ daemon -> Init ( ) ;
If you want to use the object reference created by new for other daemons , you write Init ( { % ARGS } ) .
%ARGS are the same as described in new .
Notice that you should n't call Init ( ) without argument in this case , or the next daemon will execute and / or write in the same files as the first daemon .
To prevent this use at least an empty anonymous hash here .
$ pid = $ daemon -> Init ( {} ) ; @pid = $ daemon -> Init ( { work_dir => '/other/daemon/directory ' , exec_command => [ ' perl /home/my_second_script.pl ' , ' perl /home/my_third_script.pl ' ] , } ) ;
If you do n't need the Proc : : Daemon object reference in your script , you can also use the method without object reference : $ pid = Proc : : Daemon : : Init ( ) ; # or $ pid = Proc : : Daemon :: Init ( { % ARGS } ) ;
Init returns the PID ( scalar ) of the daemon to the parent , or the PIDs ( array ) of the daemons created if exec_command has more then one program to execute .
See examples above .
Init returns 0 to the child ( daemon ) .
If you call the Init method in the context without looking for a return value ( void context ) the parent process will exit here like in earlier versions : Proc:: Daemon :: Init ( ) ; Status ( [ $ ARG ] )
This function checks the status of the process ( daemon ) .
Returns the PID number ( alive ) or 0 ( dead ) .
$ ARG can be a string with : undef , in this case it tries to get the PID to check out of the object reference settings .
a PID number to check .
the path to a file containing the PID to check .
the command line entry of the running program to check .
This requires Proc:: ProcessTable to be installed .
Kill_Daemon ( [ $ ARG [ , SIGNAL ] ] )
This function kills the Daemon process .
Returns the number of processes successfully killed ( which mostly is not the same as the PID number ) , or 0 if the process was n't found .
$ ARG is the same as of Status ( ) .
SIGNAL is an optional signal name or number as required by Perls kill function and listed out by kill -l on your system .
Default value is 9 ( ' KILL ' = non-catchable , non-ignorable kill ) .
Fork
Is like the Perl built - in fork , but it retries to fork over 30 seconds if necessary and if possible to fork at all .
It returns the child PID to the parent process and 0 to the child process .
If the fork is unsuccessful it warn s and returns undef .
OTHER METHODS
Proc:: Daemon also defines some other functions .
See source code for more details :
OpenMax ( [ $ NUMBER ] )
Returns the maximum file descriptor number .
If undetermined $ NUMBER will be returned .
adjust_settings
Does some fixes / adjustments on the new settings together with fix_filename .
fix_filename( $ KEYNAME ) Prevents double use of same filename in different processes .
get_pid( [ $ STRING ] )
Returns the wanted PID if it can be found .
get_pid_by_proc_table_attr(
$ ATTR , $ MATCH )
Returns the wanted PID by looking into the process table , or undef .
Requires the Proc:: ProcessTable module to be installed .
NOTES
Proc:: Daemon : : init is still available for backwards capability .
Proc:: Daemon is now taint safe ( assuming it is not passed any tainted parameters ) .

US President Barack Obama has shelved plans for controversial bases in Poland and the Czech Republic in a major overhaul of missile defence in Europe .
The bases are to be scrapped after a review of the threat from Iran .
Mr Obama said there would be a " proven , cost - effective " system using land - and sea - based interceptors against Iran 's short - and medium - range missile threat .
Russian President Dmitry Medvedev has welcomed the US decision , calling it a " responsible move " .
Russia had always seen the shield as a threat .
However , there has been criticism of the decision in conservative circles in the US .
The US signed a deal in August 2008 with Poland to site 10 interceptors at a base near the Baltic Sea , and with the Czech Republic to build a radar station on its territory .
ANALYSIS Kevin Connolly , BBC News , Washington
It would be hard to invent a news story that tied together more strategic and political issues than the Obama administration 's decision to change its stance on the deployment of a missile defence shield in Eastern Europe .
It touches on Washington 's assessment of Iran 's military capabilities .
There is an underlying assumption that Tehran 's capacity for mounting warheads on long - range missiles does not pose an immediate strategic headache .
It also sends a signal to the peoples of Central Europe about how President Barack Obama proposes to manage the post Cold War order in their neck of the woods in the next few years .
And it raises questions about the administration 's much - talked - about desire to " hit the reset " button on its relationship with Russia .
Will overhaul benefit US ?
The US had said the missile shield would be fully operational by 2012 .
But President Obama this year ordered a review of the defence system , which was strongly backed by his predecessor George W Bush .
' Stronger and smarter '
On Thursday , President Obama said in a live TV address that the change was needed to " deploy a defence system that best responds to the threats we face " .
He said a review had shown the need to switch strategy to defending against the short - and medium - range missiles that Iran could use to target Europe .
Twice Mr Obama referred to the need for a system that was " proven and cost effective " .
He said the new approach would provide " a stronger , smarter and swifter defence " of US and allied forces in Europe .
Mr Obama said he had spoken to both the Czech Republic and Poland and stressed his commitments to their defence .
But he said again that Russia 's concerns about the old system were " entirely unfounded " .
It is a concession to the Russians with absolutely nothing in return
John Bolton ,
former Bush undersecretary
Polish and Czech voices
In quotes : Reaction Victory for Russian diplomacy ?
Polish hopes shot down by US move White House spokesman Robert Gibbs later stressed the overhaul was " not about Russia " .
Although the White House said the US " no longer planned to move forward " with the old shield scheme for Poland and the Czech Republic , Defence Secretary Robert Gates stressed the US was not abandoning missile defence of Europe .
He said negotiations were under way with both nations about deploying upgraded SM - 3 interceptors from 2015 .
The first phase of the new strategy , he said , would be to deploy " current and proven missile defence systems in the next two years " , including the sea - based Aegis and the current SM - 3 .
Iran says its missile development programme is solely for scientific , surveillance or defensive purposes , but there are concerns in the West and among Iran 's neighbours that the rockets could be used to carry nuclear weapons .
' Responsible ' Mr Medvedev said the US decision was a " positive " one .
He said he would discuss the missile defence issue with President Obama during a visit to the United Nations in New York next week .
Mr Medvedev said in a TV address : " We value the US president 's responsible approach towards implementing our agreements .
I am ready to continue the dialogue . "
The two countries are currently in talks about reducing their nuclear weapons stockpiles , and the US move could influence Russia to be more co-operative , correspondents say .
Mr Medvedev said there were now " good conditions " for talks on missile reduction .

However , there has already been some criticism in the US .
John Bolton , who was undersecretary of state for arms control and international security under President Bush , said the move was " unambiguously a bad decision " .
He said : " This gives away an important defensive mechanism against threats from countries like Iran and other rogue states , not only for the US but for Europe as well .
" It is a concession to the Russians with absolutely nothing in return . "
Nato Secretary - General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said the US move was " a positive step " , Associated Press reported .

Remember the movie ‘ Fight Club ’ starring Brad Pitt ?
Well , it seems that some high school students in the Memphis suburban city of Collierville decided to start their own .
Dozens of high school students who all attended Collierville High School in Collierville , TN are expected to be charged after a fight club was discovered involving the teens .
The fight club was ‘ busted ’ when some of the teens decided to upload videos of their fights online on video sites such as YouTube .
The teens would gather to fight over the weekend at various locations throughout the city such as the parking lots of McAlister ’s Deli and the Paradiso movie theater in East Memphis , among others .
The teens face charges of aggravated assault , participating in prize fighting and disturbance of peace with some teens expected to be charged as adults .
近況
WEB +DB PRESS の連載はなんとか打ち切りにならず続行中 .
読んでもらえているとのフィードバックもいくつかいただき , ありがたいことでございます. 今回は CSS 周辺を読んでみました .
ようやくブラウザらしくなってきたので興味のある方はごらんください.
記事の準備と称してコードを読む週末副業も今のところ続行中.
遠くに行くのがだんだん億劫になってきたので , 近所の安コーヒー屋に通っている. ひきこもり体質の改善はならず.
連載はこのあとレイアウト , レンダリングと続く予定 .
その準備にレンダリングまわりのコードを読んでいたら , 連載で書くにはややしんどいけれど WebKit らしいコードをみかけた .
今日はその話を書いてみたい .
Core Animation - Safari の隠し味
CSS に CSS 3D Transforms Module という 策定中の標準があり , WebKit はこれを実装している .
私はビジュアルな美的感覚を欠いているので , この機能の有難味をよくわかっていなかった.
( 標準の存在も , 派手なデモ を見て驚くまで 気にとめてすらいなかったことを白状しておく. ) 一方でビジュアルな美的感覚にうるさい Apple はこの機能に熱心だ .
この標準にしたって , 見てのとおり Apple の開発者が書いている .
ビジュアル音痴なりに類推すると , Apple が 3D Transforms で実現したいのは Cover Flow や ニョッキ リ
Dock に代表され る Apple ぽい UI なのだと思う .
Apple はこれらの派手な UI を実現す る Mac OS の下地づくりを地道に進めており , 一般のアプリケーション開発者向けにも 多くの API を公開している .
そうしたミタメ API の一つが Core Animation .
最近の Safari / WebKit はこの Core Animation にレンダリング機構を統合し , ウェブアプリケーションの派手化を推し進めている...というのが本日の趣旨でございます .
この話は何人かに喋ってみたんだけれどいまいちピンときてもらえなかったので , 自分の口頭雑談能力に見切りをつけてここに書いてみることにした.
ディスプレイリスト+ツリー
例のごとく復習から .
誤解を恐れつつ平たくいうなら , Core Animation は Flash みたいなものだと思えばいい .
もう少し正確にいうと , Flash Player によく似た ディスプレイリスト+ツリー のレンダリングモデルを Mac OS と Objective - C の世界に持ち込んだものだと言える .
ディスプレイリスト+ツリーのレンダリングモデルでは , ひとまとまりの描画単位をノードに割り当て , それらのノードをつなげてツリーを作る.
Flash Player では DisplayObject や Sprite クラス , Core Animation では CALayer クラスがツリーのノードをあらわしている .
プログラマは各ノードの描画コールバックに自分の描画コードをセットする.
そうしたアプリケーションレベルの描画コードが実行されると , 各ノードのディスプレイリストが更新され描画コマンドが蓄積される.
まだ画面は更新しない .
Flash Player や Core Animation のランタイムは , 適当なタイミング( アニメーションのフレームや , ウィンドウの再描画 ) で ツリーをトラバースし , 各ノードのディスプレイリストを実行する .
実際の画面はこのとき更新される .
ディスプレイリストを評価する際には , 透明度や回転 , スケーリングなどの特性を適用することができる.
つまりノード単位で透明度を変えたり , 回転拡大縮小などの 3D 効果を加えることができる .
素朴なディスプレイリスト+ツリーは , だいたいこんなかんじで動く .
ハードウェアの支 援
ディスプレイリスト+ツリーのモデルは GPU との親和性が高く .
性能上の利点がある .
たとえばディスプレイリストの描画コマンドを
GPU 側に置き , CPU 時間を浪費せずに描画ができるかもしれない .
また写真など描画に使う素材画像をテクスチャとして
VRAM に置けば , バスへの負担は下がるだろう .
ノードの中身を変えない再描画はディスプレイリストを評価するだけで済む.
アプリケーションの描画コードは経由しないぶん速くなる.
たとえば各アルバム画像をノードに割り振り
Cover Flow 風にページをめくるアニメーションは , 典型的な " ノードの中身を変えない再描画 " になるだろう .
ノードに半透明表示の指定をもつ描画も , GPU 支援を受けるディプレイリスト+ツリーに分がある.
ノードが半透明指定を持つとき , そのノードの描画結果は 一旦独立したオフスクリーンのビットマップに描画され , そのビットマップに透明度を掛けて最終的な画面に合成する.
そのビットマップが VRAM 上にあれば , 画面の合成は GPU を頼れる .
ビットマップ+ツリー - Flash Player の場合
さて , 上で説明した素朴なモデルは GPU への要求が高く , また空間効率も良くはない .
そうした問題を回避するため , 現実の実装は何らかの工夫をしているだろう.
Flash Player の例を考えてみよう .
先に ディスプレイリスト+ツリー のモデルは Flash Player に似ていると書いた .
Core Animation と異り , 従来の Flash Player は ディスプレリスト+ツリーを CPU 側だけで実現していた .
Flash Player のバージョ ン 10 は DisplayObject の 3D 変換をサポートし , 同時に GPU の積極的な活用をはじめた .
つまり Flash Player はディスプレイリスト+ツリーを GPU 側に推し進めた ...と 思いたいところだけれど , どうも事情は違うらしい .
中の人によると , Flash Player が使う GPU 支援の範囲は画像合成の計算に限られているようだ .
つまりディスプレイストや素材画像は主記憶に置いて
CPU で評価する .
そして描画結果のビットマップを VRAM に転送 , GPU で合成するのだろう .
主記憶 -> VRAM の転送コストは気になる( 上の blog にも " 速くなるとは限らない " とある ) けれど , ノード ( DisplayObject ) 毎の描画結果を使い回せるなら 3D 変換などの描画効果は GPU で速くなる .
また リリースノート に見られる bitmap cache 云々の記述や上の blog にある描画結果の乱れに関する注意書きから , 描画結果を使い回す工夫をしている様子もある .
今日の主役は Core Animation と GPU 支援なので , ノードを描画したビットマップだけを VRAM 側に置く Flash Player 10 のモデルは ビットマップ+ツリー と呼んでおこう .
既存のコンテンツが多く , また実行するハードウェアを選り好みもできない事情があるから ,
Adobe はソフトウェア側に倒した折衷案としてビットマップ+ツリーを選んだのだと思う.
当面は GPU を頼らないと腹をくくったのか , CPU のコア数増加に合わせた描画の並列化を進めている ( とリリースノートに書いてあった ) .
ゼロ+ツリーからディスプレイリスト+ツリーへの移行
- Cocoa の場合
Mac OS X 10.5 から導入された新しい API である Core Animation に下位互換性の問題はない .
対象ハードウェアも最新のものが相手だから性能に妥協する必要もない.
Core Animation が先に示したベタなディスプレイリスト+ツリーのモデルに近いのは , そんな背景がある .
( ただし Quartz の描画機能すべてを GPU だけで描画できるわけではないらしい .
Mac OS
Internals によると , いくつかの複雑な描画はソフトウェアに戻って行うという. )
Core Animation は独立した API からのみ利用できるわけではなく , GUI フレームワークの Cocoa にも統合されている .
従来の Cocoa はウィンドウ内にあるウィジェット( ビュー ) のツリーに特別な資源を割り付けない , いわば ゼロ+ツリー の描画モデルだった .
今はそれが Core Animation に統合され , NSView の特別なメソッドを呼び出すと Cocoa のビューツリーに Core Animation のツリーが割り付けられる .
具体的には該当ビューをルートとするビュー部分木の各ノードに
レイヤツリーのノードが与えられる. つまりそのサブツリーはディスプレイリスト+ツリーモデルに切り替わる.
Apple はこの仕組みを Layer Backed View と呼んでいる .
( 紹介資料 . )
Layer Backed View のウィジェットには回転やドロップシャドウなど
Core Animation 由来のエフェクトを適用することができる .
Core Animation との統合を通じて既存のアプリケーションもミタメをよくしろということなんだろうね .
追記 : この節の内容は間違っていました .
記事末尾を参照ください .
Safari / WebKit と Core Animation の統合
うっかり復習が長びいてしまった. ようやく本題 .
今年二月頃 , Apple の開発者は accelerated compositing と銘打っ て Core Animation を WebKit に統合した .
( Bug 23360 - Make repainting compositing - aware for accelerated compositing . ) コンパイルオプションで # if USE( ACCELERATED_COMPOSITING ) を有効にすると , WebKit の描画は Core Animation に統合されたパスに入る .
WebKit は内部にページ単位の描画用ツリー( =Render Tree ) を持っており , 従来の描画ではこのツリーをトラバースする .
詳しい話はそのうち連載に書くから省略するとして , 大ざっぱにこんな感じだと思えばいい:
// クラス名などは架空のものです void Document :: paint( GraphicsContext* ctx ) { m_rootNode -> paint ( ctx ) ; } void RenderNode : : paint( GraphicsContext* ctx ) { this -> paintThisNode( ctx ) ; for each ( c in this -> children ) c->repaint ( ctx ) ; }
このとき GraphicsContext は WebKit の利用者が与える .
ウィンドウの場合もあるし , オフスクリーンの場合もある .
Document : : paint( ) はページ全体を引数の GraphicsContext に描画する . 当然 , 各 RenderNode はオフスクリーンやディスプレイリストといった描画資源を持たない.
そういう意味で WebKit は ゼロ+ツリー モデルに従っている .
GraphicsContext のように描画を抽象化したオブジェクトを渡すこの切り口は , 描画を伴うライブラリの定番と言って良い .
さて , どうすればゼロ +ツリーの WebKit をディスプレイリスト+ツリーの
Core Graphics に 統合できるのか , 一見するとあまり自明でない .
WebKit を Cocoa , RenderNode を NSView に見たてた上で , Layer Backed View に倣い RenderNode ( 仮名 ) インスタンス毎に CALayer を割り当てる方法も考えられる. けれど RenderNode ( 仮名 ) のインスタンス数はおよそ DOM ノードの数に比例する .
その全てに CALayer を割り当てるのはオーバーヘッドが大きい .
もうすこし疎な粒度で割り付けたい .
WebKit におけるレイ ヤ
Apple にとっては好都合なことに , WebKit も内部にレイヤ構造 RenderLayer を持っていた .
accelerated compositing 拡張は Core Animation の CALayer を RenderLayer 毎に割り付けている .
この RenderLayer クラスは昔からあるもので , Core Animation とは関係がない .
RenderLayer はもともと , RenderNode : : repaint ( ) のウソコードで示したような深さ 優先のトラバースで実現できない描画を行うために追加された.
Render
Tree 上で表現されていない描画順や暗黙の親子関係を表現するために , WebKit は RenderLayer のツリーを作る .
各 RenderLayer は , 通常のトラバースで描画できる Render Tree のサブツリーをあらわしている .
木の中に木があるのはちょっとややこしいけれど , ブラウザのコードではよくある話 .
ひとつの RenderLayer が受け持つ各サブツリーの中は通常のトラバース順で描画され , RenderNode (仮 ) が責任を持つ .
サブツリー間の描画順は RenderLayer が決める .
定義はこんなの :
class RenderLayer : public ScrollbarClient { public : ... // 描画メソッド void paint ( GraphicsContext* , const IntRect& damageRect , ... ) ; ... private : ... // 対応元の Render Tree ノード - 描画単位となるサブツリーのルート RenderBoxModelObject * m_renderer ; // ツリーの枝 RenderLayer * m_parent ; RenderLayer * m_previous ; RenderLayer * m_next ; RenderLayer * m_first ; RenderLayer * m_last ; ... } ;
Render Tree と RenderLayer
さて , RenderLayer はどんな単位でインスタンス化されるのだろう .
" 通常のトラバースで描画 " できるのは , どういうサブツリーなのだろうか . 一旦 Core Animation から離れ , RenderLayer のコードを眺めてみよう .
各 Render Tree ノードに対し RenderLayer のインスタンス化を判断する RenderBoxModelObject::requiresLayer ( ) メソッドはこう定義されている :
... class RenderBoxModelObject : public RenderObject { ... virtual bool requiresLayer ( ) const { return isRoot ( ) || isPositioned ( ) || isRelPositioned ( ) || isTransparent ( ) || has OverflowClip ( ) || has Transform ( ) || hasMask ( ) || hasReflection ( ) ; } ... } ; ...
ツリーのルート isRoot ( ) , 透明度つきのノード isTransparent ( ) , 描画のクリッピングが必要なノード has OverflowClip ( ) と has Mask ( ) , 件の transform CSS プロパティを持つもの has Transform ( ) などに RenderLayer が作られるとわかる .
透明度つきの Render Tree ノードは RenderLayer の必要性を端的に表している .
透明度つきのノードをルートとするサブツリーは , まず独立したビットマップに描画される. それからビットマップに透明度をかけて全体の描画結果に合成される.
RenderLayer は , 独立して描画したいこのようなサブツリーをあらわす .
isRelPositioned ( ) や isPositioned ( ) もわかりやすい .
" position : relative " や " position : absolute " のブロックは通常のフローレイアウトと独立したレイアウトが行われ , 従って描画の順番も変化する. z- index プロパティで明示的に描画順を指定されることもある.
これらのノードを含む Render
Tree が深さ優先トラバースで描画できないのは明らかだ .
これら特別な position を持つノードのサブツリーも RenderLayer になる .
RenderLayer は子のレイヤを z 順にソートして描画する .
4 年前の requiresLayer ( ) を 覗いてみると , いま示した 合成の都合による一時的なオフスクリーンバッファの確保 や レイアウトの都合による描画順の制御 という RenderLayer の意図が , よりはっきり現れていた .
... bool RenderObject::requiresLayer ( ) { return isRoot ( ) || isPositioned ( ) || isRelPositioned ( ) || style ( ) -> opacity ( ) < 1.0f || has OverflowClip ( ) ; } ...
RenderLayer から CALayer へ
Apple は , この RenderLayer を中心に Core Animation を統合した .
accelerated compositing を有効にした RenderLayer には , 統合に伴う各種面倒を押し込んだ RenderLayerBacking オブジェクトが追加され る
... class RenderLayer : public ScrollbarClient { public : ... # if USE ( ACCELERATED_COMPOSITING ) OwnPtr<RenderLayerBacking > m_backing ; // これ #endif ... } ; ..
RenderLayerBacking は CALayer のラッパオブジェクト GraphicsLayer をもつ .
// rendering / RenderLayerBacking .h ... class RenderLayerBacking : public GraphicsLayerClient { public : .... // GraphicsLayer がいくつもある事情はコメントを参照 . OwnPtr< GraphicsLayer > m_ancestorClippingLayer ; // only used if we are clipped by an ancestor which is not a stacking context OwnPtr < GraphicsLayer > m_graphicsLayer ; OwnPtr< GraphicsLayer > m_foregroundLayer ; // only used in cases where we need to draw the foreground separately OwnPtr < GraphicsLayer > m_clippingLayer ; // only used if we have clipping on a stacking context , with compositing children OwnPtr < GraphicsLayer > m_maskLayer ; // only used if we have a mask } ;
GraphicsLayer はいちおう環境非依存ということになっており , 実体である mac 版のサブクラス GraphicsLayerCA が Core Animation 由来の CALayer オブジェクトを持っている .
// GraphicsLayerCA.h class GraphicsLayerCA : public GraphicsLayer { public : RetainPtr < WebLayer > m_layer ; // WebLayer は CALayer のサブクラス RetainPtr< WebLayer > m_transformLayer ; RetainPtr< CALayer > m_contentsLayer ; } ;
GraphicsLayerCA が持つ 3 つの CALayer ファミリのインスタンス は m_transformLayer -> m_layer -> m_contentsLayer という親子関係をつくっている. たぶん Safari 側の都合で設定したい属性と WebKit 側からの属性をうまく混ぜるための トリックだと思うけれど , 詳細はよくわからず .
とにかく , こうして RenderLayer と CALayer , WebKit と Core Animation は繋がっている .
CALayer のツリー構造は , GraphicsLayer を介して RenderLayer のツリー構造と同期される .
ツリー構造の保守は RenderLayerCompositor が行う. RenderLayer はツリー構造が変更される様々なタイミングで RenderLayerCompositor に 構造の変更を通知し , RenderLayerCompositor が GraphicsLayer を調整する .
例 :
void RenderLayer::addChild ( RenderLayer * child , RenderLayer * beforeChild ) { .... # if USE ( ACCELERATED_COMPOSITING ) compositor ( ) -> layerWasAdded ( this , child ) ; #endif }
このように若干なげやり感ただようコードが RenderLayer の各所に埋め込まれている .
実際の同期コードは遅延とか色々ややこしいことをやってそうなので割愛させていただきます.
なお , 全ての RenderNode ( 仮 ) に RenderLayer が作られるわけではないように , 全ての RenderLayer に RenderLayerBacking が作られるわけでもない .
RenderLayerBacking を持つ RenderLayer は self painting layer と呼ばれ , 以下のような条件を満たしている .
.... bool RenderLayer::isSelfPaintingLayer ( ) const { return !isNormalFlowOnly ( ) || renderer ( ) -> hasReflection ( ) || renderer ( ) -> hasMask ( ) || renderer ( ) ->isTableRow ( ) || renderer ( ) -> isVideo( ) ; } ....
normal flow でない ( 特別な position プロパティを持ち , transform プロパティを持つかもしれない ) ノード , < video > 要素のノード , などが該当している .
そのほか mask とか reflection は webkit 拡張.
opacity が考慮されないところ , table の行が入っているところは意外 .
描画シーケンスの変 更
ゼロ+ツリーからディスプレイリスト+ツリーへの変更は , 描画コードの実行順序にも大きく影響する. 従来の WebKit は , ページを表示しているウィンドウ ( Mac OS だと NSView ) からの要求に応じてページ全体を再描画していた .
描画時は再描画範囲をあらわす矩形が与えられるから実際に全画面を書き直すわけではないけれど , Render Tree をルートからトラバースして個々の RenderNode を描画しようとするのは確かだ .
Mac OS での描画結果は NSView の GraphicsContext に書き込まれる .
accelerated compositing パッチでは , 描画を RenderLayer 単位で行う .
つまり RenderLayer 毎に割り付けられた CALayer に描画を行う .
描画は CALayer から要求される .
結果として , accelerated compositing を有効にした WebKit は従来の描画パスで何も描画しない .
void RenderLayer::paintLayer( RenderLayer * rootLayer , GraphicsContext * p , ... ) { # if USE ( ACCELERATED_COMPOSITING ) if ( isComposited ( ) ) { // The updatingControlTints ( ) painting pass goes through compositing layers , // but we need to ensure that we do n't cache clip rects computed with the wrong root in this case .
if ( p->updatingControlTints ( ) ) paintFlags |= PaintLayerTemporaryClipRects ; else if (! backing ( )->paintingGoesToWindow ( ) && ! shouldDoSoftwarePaint ( this , paintFlags & PaintLayerPaintingReflection ) ) { //
If this RenderLayer should paint into its backing , that will be done via RenderLayerBacking : : paintIntoLayer ( ) .
return ; // CALayer に描画する場合はこのパスに入る . } } #endif .... ここから先が従来の描画パス }
実際の描画コードは RenderLayerBacking :: paintIntoLayer ( ) にある .
// Share this with RenderLayer : : paintLayer , which would have to be educated about GraphicsLayerPainting Phase ?
void RenderLayerBacking ::paintIntoLayer( RenderLayer * rootLayer , GraphicsContext * context , ... ) { ... }
冒頭のコメントから少しは罪の意識が伺える , 気もする .
条件によっては従来の描画パスも使われるのがややこしい.
" DRY じゃない " などと甘ったれたことを言わないのが WebKit 流とはいえ , 描画バグの原因究明は大変に違いない .
読んでいるだけで肝を冷やした .
各ポートへの影 響
Qt や Gtk , Cairo , Chromium ( Skia ) など , WebKit にはいくつかのポートがある .
おそらく accelerated compositing に一番肝を冷やしたのは , 各ポートの開発者ではないかと思う .
Core Animation や
Flash に相当する ディスプレイリスト+ツリー( またはビットマップ+ツリー)のオブジェクトモデルを持つ描画処理系は , それほど多くない .
GPU 支援を合わると尚更敷居は高くなる. 同じ WebKit なのに Safari の CSS 3D Transform だけがガンガン動き , 自分のポートではコマ落ちしてしまう...なんてことになったら , 顧客や上司にいびられやしないか .
調べてみると , Qt は一応 OpenGL に統合されているようす .
OpenGL の描画とウィジェットを合成する チュートリアル があった .
GTK にんな大層な機能があると聞いたことはない . ただ GTK 由来の Glib を使った Clutter Toolkit は ディスプレイリスト+ツリーの API を提供している .
GTK インテグレーションのデモもある . 開発元の OpenedHand は Intel に買収されており , Clutter Toolkit は Moblin のミタメ強化を期待されているのだろう .
WebKit +GTK が将来的に WebKit + Clutter に移行してもそれほど不思議はない . ( 開発は進んでいるらしい . )
Cairo , Skia はベクターグラフィクスの描画ライブラリという出自もあって
Core Animation に相当するレイヤはない .
Skia にはちょっとした GUI ツールキットが付属しているようだけれど , ちょっとみたかんじゼロ+ツリーの実装だった .
Cairo はさてお き Skia ...というか Chromium と Android ポートにとっては少し面倒な事態かもしれない .
性能を売りにしている以上は CSS の 3D Transforms も高速に動かしたいけれど , 現状は Safari + Core Animation のような GPU 支援がない .
Skia をチューニングするのか , accelerated compositing に必要なパーツを揃えるのか , 別の路 線 ( 並列化とか ) で対抗するのか .
各ブラウザの CSS3 実装が出揃った頃 , レンダリング性能のベンチマーク競争が始まるだろう.
その時 Chromium や( 今回の話とは関係ないけど ) Mozilla がどんな手を打つのか , 個人的にはとても興味を持っている .
それ以前に CSS3 の派手なエフェクトは流行るのか , という疑問もある .
きっと iPhone の Safari 向けにキュンキュン動くウェブアプリが登場して人気を博し , ( ついでに開発の面倒 な iPhone アプリは下火になり , ) 競合の Android や各種ケータイ向けブラウザが追従 , デスクトップにもその流れが及ぶ ...という展開が自然だけれど , Flash も Silverlight もあるから , どうなるんだろうね .
雑感
個人的には , 複雑な描画の要件とややこしいコードベース持つブラウザを , 近代的で GPU フレンドリな構造に乗せかえ たApple ( というか Simon Fraser ) の手腕に , 肝を冷やしつつ感動した .
ブラウザの描画は文字が多くコンテンツの構成も多様で ,
Flash のように描画中心のモデルに比べて高速化はやりにくいだろうと想像していた.
だから JavaScript の性能競争が一段落したあとにやってくるであろうレンダリングの性能競争で どんなアイデアが現れるのか , 外野なりに興味を持ってみていた .
Flash の並列化が念頭にあったので , 何らかの並列化を漠然と想像していたけれど , WebKit のように並列性を考えていないコードでそれをやるのも難儀だろうし , 並列化の粒度も良い切り口がなさそうに見えた .
そんな難題に対し , 彼らは .
CSS Transforms と Core Animation を軸に RenderLayer という絶妙な切り口を掴み , ややこしいツリーのジャグリングをこなし , レガシーなレンダリングモデルを一気に近代化した .
その力技にびびらずにはおれない .
RenderLayer はもともとの KTHML にはなかったもので , Mozilla 出身の WebKit 開発者 David Hyatt が Gecko のコードベースから ひっこぬいてねじこんだという経緯がある .
( だから RenderLayer.h / cpp には Netscape の Copyright があり , MPL が併記されている . )
Simon Fraser による実装の背後には David Hyatt との議論なんかも あったんだろうなーなどと想像し , やっぱり最後は Mozilla なのか , と思ったりもした .
まとめ
というわけで WebKit の Core Animation 統合について書いてみました .
たぶんぜんぶ読んだ人はいないと思うのでまとめ:
前提 : Max OS X の Core Animation は
Flash 風のプログラミングモデルを GPU 支援をうけながら実現したもの ディスプレイリスト+ツリーと呼んでみた
WebKit の accelerated compositing オプションは RenderLayer を起点に Core Animation を統合した .
WebKit にはもともとレイヤ構造があったでのでそれに相乗りした
RenderLayer のツリーをミラーした CALayer のツリーができ る
描画シーケンスがけっこう変わる
Core Animation のない WebKit ポートはどうすんだ プレッシャーうけてがんばるのではない か
雑談どころか連載一回分くらいあるんじゃね？
訂正 - 現行の Core Animation は ビットマップ+ツリー
Wikipedia を見ていたら , Quartz の OpenGL アクセラレーションは現行の Mac OS では無効化されているらしく , 確認したところ Core Animation も DisplayList や VBO は使っていなかった .
Core Animation は ( おそらくソフトウェアで ) ラスタライズを行い , それをテクスチャとして VRAM に置く .
つまりディスプレイリスト+ツリー ではなく ビットマップ+ツリー の実装だった .
大ウソついてごめんなさい . QuartzGL の話と混同してました ...
参考までにウソだと確かめる方法を紹介 :
WebKit をチェックアウトしてビルドす る
WebKitTools / Script / run - webkit -- debug で起動 このへんは普通に nightly を使うでいいのかも .
/ Developer / Applicaitons / Graphics Tools / OpenGL Profiler.app を起動
" Collect Trace " をチェックして Safari にアタッ チ
http://webkit.org/blog-files/3d-transforms/poster-circle.html を表示
OpenGL Profiler の Trace ウィンドウを眺め る
DisplayList や VBO 系の API が呼ばれていないのを確認し , glPixelStorei ( ) などを見てうなだれ る
アップロード前にやっとけという指摘にうなだれつつごめんなさい.
ポートへの影響についても , ソフトウェアラスタライザでいいなら Core Animation 相当を用意するのは割と現実的なのかも .
Cloud hosting uses resources from clustered servers .
The clients ’ websites use the virtual resources of several servers , located in the cloud .
Cloud web hosting is a perfect solution for websites that have outgrown the resources of their existing shared hosting provider .
Web hosting cloud also refers to cloud web hosting .
Some of the advantages of using cloud - based web hosting include scalability , savings , and immediacy among others .
Most recent and progressed technology
It is not difficult to find good and reliable providers of cloud web hosting services in the U.S.A .
Today there is quite some cloud server provides the USA , however , not all of them are reliable .
You must ensure that you look for a good web host offering cloud web hosting services .
Good web hosts ensure that the cloud web hosting needs of their clients met .
Some of the other characteristics of good web hosts are reliability , good network uptime , reliable customer support team , good performance , a variety of features and speedy fasting just to mention a few .

Irritable bowel syndrome is a common condition A soluble fibre supplement should be the first line of attack in treating irritable bowel syndrome , experts say .
Researchers from Utrecht University in the Netherlands compared adding bran , a soluble supplement called psyllium and a dummy supplement to sufferers ' diets .
They found psyllium was the most effective , warning that bran may even worsen the symptoms of the condition , the British Medical Journal reported .
As many as one in 10 people is estimated to have the condition .
It is characterised by abdominal pain and an irregular bowel habit .
I think adding psyllium to the diet is the best treatment option to start with
Dr Niek de Wit , researcher
Its exact cause is unknown and recommendations for treatment include dietary advice , antidepressants and drug treatments .
Many relying on dietary adjustments still turn to bran in a bid to help improve the way the intestines work .
But the Dutch study of 275 patients questions the wisdom of this approach .
The team gave patients 10g of either psyllium , bran or rice flour twice a day for 12 weeks .
Symptom severity
At the end of the study , those on psyllium , a naturally occurring vegetable fibre , reported symptom severity had been reduced by 90 points using a standard scale of rating problems .
For bran it was 58 points and for the placebo group , 49 .
The report also showed that patients seemed less tolerant of bran , with more than half of the group dropping out during the trial , mostly because their symptoms worsened .
Soluble fibre can also be found in fruit such as apples and strawberries , as well as barley and oats .
But Dr Niek de Wit , one of the researchers , said : " It is unlikely that people with IBS would get enough from fruit and other foods to help them .
" I think adding psyllium to the diet is the best treatment option to start with .
In the study , people did this by adding it to things such as yoghurt and it had a real effect . "
Dr Anton Emmanuel , medical director of Core , the charity for diseases of the gut , said bran was being over -used .
He said the study was " helpful " and " reasonably robust " , adding : " Putting it all together , patients should tolerate this form of fibre well and it may help some , especially those with a tendency to constipation . "

China alarmed by US money printing
Telegraph
The US Federal Reserve ’s policy of printing money to buy Treasury debt threatens to set off a serious decline of the dollar and compel China to redesign its foreign reserve policy , according to a top member of the Communist hierarchy .

Working for the Yankee dollar : Beijing is said to be dismayed by the Fed ’s recourse to ‘ credit easing ’
Photo : Reuters Cheng Siwei , former vice - chairman of the Standing Committee and now head of China ’s green energy drive , said Beijing was dismayed by the Fed ’s recourse to “ credit easing ” .
“ We hope there will be a change in monetary policy as soon as they have positive growth again , ” he said at the Ambrosetti Workshop , a policy gathering on Lake Como .

Analysis : China ’s ‘ Beijing Put ’ on the gold price “ If they keep printing money to buy bonds it will lead to inflation , and after a year or two the dollar will fall hard .
Most of our foreign reserves are in US bonds and this is very difficult to change , so we will diversify incremental reserves into euros , yen , and other currencies , ” he said .
China ’s reserves are more than – $ 2 trillion , the world ’s largest .
“ Gold is definitely an alternative , but when we buy , the price goes up .
We have to do it carefully so as not to stimulate the markets , ” he added .
The comments suggest that China has become the driving force in the gold market and can be counted on to
buy whenever there is a price dip , putting a floor under any correction .
Mr Cheng said the Fed ’s loose monetary policy was stoking an unstable asset boom in China .
“ If we raise interest rates , we will be flooded with hot money .
We have to wait for them .
If they raise , we raise .
“ Credit in China is too loose .
We have a bubble in the housing market and in stocks so we have to be very careful , because this could fall down . ”
Mr Cheng said China had learned from the West that it is a mistake for central banks to target retail price inflation and take their eye off assets .
“ This is where Greenspan went wrong from 2000 to 2004 , ” he said .
“ He thought everything was alright because inflation was low , but assets absorbed the liquidity . ”
Mr Cheng said China had lost 20 m jobs as a result of the crisis and advised the West not to over - estimate the role that his country can play in global recovery .
China ’s task is to switch from export dependency to internal consumption , but that requires a “ change in the ideology of the Chinese people ” to discourage excess saving .
“ This is very difficult ” .
Mr Cheng said the root cause of global imbalances is spending patterns in US ( and UK ) and China .
“ The US spends tomorrow ’s money today , ” he said .
“ We Chinese spend today ’s money tomorrow .
That ’s why we have this financial crisis . ”
Yet the consequences are not symmetric .
“ He who goes borrowing , goes sorrowing , ” said Mr Cheng .
It was a quote from US founding father Benjamin Franklin .

1 - 2. Frank Sinatra & Dean Martin , Cannonball Run II ( 1984 )
Everyone who ’s ever seen Cannonball Run II knows how truly awful it is .
It does n’t just manage to be an incredibly bad movie in spite of dozens of talented actors , it pulls off the near - miracle of being even worse than Cannonball Run , which was the worst thing ever made by humans until its sequel hit the screens .
But what is n’t as well known is that the Hal Needham race - movie crudtacular managed to do what decades of smoking , bad diets , and alcohol abuse could n’t :
It killed off the Rat Pack .
Not only was it Dean Martin ’s final film prior to his death , but it apparently so traumatized Frank Sinatra that he never appeared in another movie .
And Sinatra at least got to play himself .
( Sammy Davis , Jr. survived , if you can call starring in The Perils Of P.K. with Professor Irwin Corey surviving . )
What ’s more , while Jim Nabors lived through Cannonball Run II , he has n’t made another big - screen appearance since .
Sinatra and Martin made some lousy movies in their crossover careers , but they deserved better than to go out with a movie that made stink lines come off the screen .
3. Bela Lugosi , Plan 9 From Outer Space ( 1959 )
Bela Lugosi ’s career was one long , sad testament to the perils of drug addiction .
He slid from handsome , immensely popular Hungarian matinee idol to big- screen Hollywood legend for his portrayal of Dracula down to appearing alongside Criswell and Dudley Manlove in what is widely regarded as one of the worst movies ever made .
Lugosi died before Plan 9 was finished , but his humiliation did n’t end there :
He was replaced by dentist / theatrical amateur Tom Mason , who “ impersonated ” him by stomping around with a cape over his face .
And when the movie came out , fans of the legendary actor had to contend with a final screen appearance drawn from the ridiculous scenarios and dialogue of director Ed Wood .
The inherent tragicomedy of the situation eventually led Tim Burton to make a movie about it , featuring Martin Landau as Lugosi .
The film earned Landau an Oscar , an award Lugosi never got within sniffing distance of winning .
4. Groucho Marx , Skidoo ( 1968 )
Technically , Groucho Marx is n’t the worst thing about the deranged Otto Preminger anti-classic Skidoo .
In fact , playing the mob boss “ God , ” he may be the best .
But that statement denotes a landmark in damning by faint praise .
Preminger ’s film is an absolute mess , from its early scenes of Carol Channing in hippie drag to its final moments , where the end credits are sung in their entirety by a baffled - sounding Harry Nilsson .
Preminger , desperately trying to understand the counterculture , dropped acid , made wholesale ( and inexplicable ) changes to the script , and screamed at Groucho on the set .
The latter would be a bigger problem if Groucho had cared in the least , but he was carrying on his own far more successful experiments with LSD at the time ; he went out in a bad way by agreeing to star in this stinker , but if his hallucinations led to visions of dancing , singing garbage cans , he had the good taste to leave them out of his films .
Preminger did n’t .
5. Bruce Lee , Game Of Death ( 1978 )
Following Bruce Lee ’s tragic 1973demise , a cottage industry of impersonators sprang up in Hong Kong , including Bruce Li , Bruce Le , Bruce Liang , and Dragon Lee .
But it ’s particularly hard for fans of the Little Dragon to swallow the fact that a Bruce Lee imitator — Kim Tai Chung — actually appeared in Bruce Lee ’s final film , playing Lee himself .
Unlike many inauspicious swan songs , Game Of Death at least had the potential to be a great movie ;
Lee wrote the script , choreographed the action , and directed some of the footage starting in 1972 .
Some of the surviving scenes of Lee fighting various martial - arts experts , including Filipino fighter Dan Inosanto and basketball star Kareem Abdul - Jabbar , are thrilling hints at what might have been .
When Enter The Dragon director Robert Clouse decided to finish the movie years later , though , he did it on the cheap , endlessly recycling the existing footage , using bad stand-ins , and hiring a Hollywood hack to complete the screenplay .
He also covered Lee ’s absence in cartoonishly stupid ways , from filming a cardboard cut - out to showing Lee ’s “ reflection ” in a mirror that was really a poster .
To add insult to injury , Lee ’s character fakes his own death — and Crouse uses newsreel footage of the actor ’s actual funeral to portray the funeral of his character .

6. Raul Julia , Street Fighter ( 1994 )
In spite of a varied filmography and lengthy theater background that showcased his ability to be dashing , macabre , and witty , Raul Julia is mostly remembered for his dazzling performances as Gomez Addams in the film adaptations of the Charles Addams strip .
And while he excelled in that adaptation , he was jaw - droppingly horrible in another : 1994 ’s Street Fighter , loosely based on the videogame .
It is n’t just Julia , though .
Nobody is good in this significantly unfaithful interpretation of the arcade brawler .
While some of the cast apparently learned their lines phonetically ( not just Jean - Claude Van Damme ) , Julia valiantly but unsuccessfully tries to bring menace and weight to warlord M. Bison , in spite of dialogue like this clunker , delivered while preparing to torture a would - be assailant : “ You always hid behind your sumo and your boxer . ”
At other times — usually when he must laugh maniacally while staring at the camera — Julia instead chooses to ham it up for those who could n’t tell he was the bad guy .
It ’s an unfortunate , cheesy bookend to an otherwise enviable career , made all the more tragic by Julia ’s gaunt appearance ; he was in the final stages of a battle with stomach cancer at the time .
Also sad is the movie ’s odd inclusion of a post - credits teaser for a sequel that suggests Bison is still alive , even though the credits honor Julia ’s 1994 death with a somber “ Vaya con dios . ”
7. Gene Kelly , Xanadu ( 1980 )
He was one of the premier dancers of American film .
He co-directed Singin ’ In The Rain , the greatest musical ever made .
And he could have stopped just a few movies earlier and chosen the sublime Jacques Demy film The Young Girls Of Rochefort ( 1967 ) as his final film .
But no , Gene Kelly opted to hop back into films after he crossed into his sixth decade , including the famed 1980 debacle Xanadu .
Was it the roller - skating that attracted him ?
The disco take on Greek mythology ?
The tracksuits ?
The headbands ?
Whatever Kelly ’s reasons for taking the role of Danny McGuire , museless former bandleader and construction mogul , it turned out to be his final film .
But honestly , he would n’t have done much better if he ’d stopped one film earlier :
His penultimate theatrical release was Viva Knievel !

8. Peter Sellers , The Fiendish Plot Of Dr. Fu Manchu ( 1980 )
Imagine you ’re a Peter Sellers fan in August 1980 .
You ’re still mourning Sellers ’ death from just a few weeks earlier .
What more fitting tribute than to attend his final film in its first week of release at the local multiplex ?
Fans could n’t have known that no Pink Panther awaited them — just a racially insensitive spoof that ends , inexplicably , with the saddest disco -dance scene in all of moviedom .
What ’s worse , the great comedian reportedly even directed part of the movie .
At least Sellers put himself in contention for the steepest drop in quality between his penultimate and final films :
The great Being
There arrived just a year before .
9. Bette Davis , Wicked Stepmother ( 1989 )
Bette Davis was in her early 80s when she started filming Larry Cohen ’s Wicked Stepmother , but she looks about 110 .
When she dropped out of filming early on , she said it was due to problems with the script and the way she was being shot , and while Cohen has since claimed Davis was covering for bad health , the movie seems to agree more with her than him .
In the 20 minutes she appears onscreen , Davis plays a witch who marries Colleen Camp ’s widowed father ; she quickly ingratiates herself with Camp ’s husband , while filling the house with cigarette smoke and a cat .
( Camp plays a non-smoking vegetarian with allergies . )
It ’s all supposed to be hilarious , but Davis looks frighteningly emaciated , and her poor physical condition makes it impossible to laugh without wincing .
When she leaves the story and gets replaced by her daughter , Barbara Carrera , it ’s a relief , but the images linger .
Davis died a few months after filming , and Stepmother remains an ignoble end to a storied career .
10 . Veronica Lake , Flesh Feast ( 1970 )
Veronica Lake had a tough time after her 1940s heyday , battling alcoholism , the IRS , mental illness , and a flatlined acting career that left her working as a barmaid .
Publishing an autobiography helped put her back on her feet , but Flesh Feast , her 1970 return to the silver screen , did n’t exactly put her back on the map .
The low - budget horror movie starred Lake , who also produced , as a scientist contracted to revive Hitler ’s corpse by way of her trademark flesh - devouring , youth - restoring maggots .
The child of a concentration - camp victim , Lake understandably has mixed feelings about this , and in the movie ’s finale , she exacts revenge on Hitler by demonstrating that her maggots have the power to take life as well as restore it .
Yes , the star of Sullivan ’s Travels ended her career by putting maggots on Hitler ’s face .
11 . Joan Crawford , Trog ( 1970 )
1970 was a bad year for classic movie stars dabbling in horror .
For Trog , Joan Crawford teamed with Freddie Francis , an Oscar - winning cinematographer with a sideline in directing horror movies .
Trog was n’t one of Francis ’ better efforts , classed up only a tad by the presence of Crawford , who plays an anthropologist trying to tame a revived sub - human troglodyte lovingly nicknamed “ Trog . ” Spoiler :
It does n’t work out well .
The most terrifying detail : Crawford appears to be wearing almost as much makeup as the actor playing Trog .
12 . John Belushi , Neighbors ( 1981 )
At least give John Belushi credit for trying something different with his poorly received final film , Neighbors .
In a bid to finally escape the “ Fatty fall down , make funny ” straitjacket , Belushi switched roles with Dan Aykroyd early in production , opting to play a milquetoast suburban everyman whose life is tuned upside down by his outrageous new next - door neighbors ( Aykroyd and Catherine Moriarty , fresh off Raging Bull ) .
Critics and audiences alike jeered the change in pace .
Aykroyd and Belushi warred openly with director John G. Avildsen , and a highly regarded Larry Gelbart script based on Thomas Berger ’s novel was transformed into a would - be satire .
13 . Chris Farley , Almost Heroes ( 1998 )
Considering the one - two punch of his duds Black Sheep and Beverly Hills Ninja , perhaps Chris Farley had already reached his filmmaking peak and was tumbling down the other side when one too many speedballs cut his life short .
But no one as talented and funny as Farley should have to be remembered for a final stinker like Almost Heroes ( or , for that matter , Dirty Work , in which he later had a posthumous , uncredited cameo ) .
Buddying up with the always - forgettable Matthew Perry in one of Christopher Guest ’s unfortunate non-mockumentaries , Farley puts a coonskin cap on his one character — the loud , boorish buffoon — as a 19th - century explorer of the American West trying to beat Lewis and Clark to the Pacific .
As last films go , at least Almost Heroes is a somewhat solid , though derivative , rundown of Farley ’s career highlights , from weight jokes ( he sobs in shame while eating eagle eggs he ’s supposed to be using as medicine to save his partner ’s life ) to over - the - top freak - outs to Tommy Boy .
( The scene in which he makes fun of Perry ’s masturbating is paraphrased from the earlier film . )
In Farley ’s final scene , he soars with an eagle to unimaginable heights , then gets crapped on and plummets into the ocean , a fitting metaphor for his career .
14 . Orson Welles , The Transformers : The Movie ( 1986 )
Technically , Orson Welles ’ last film role was the 1987 romantic comedy Someone To Love , a minor but not horribly embarrassing grace note .
But Love was n’t actually the last film Welles worked on before his death in 1985 — that honor falls to an 84 - minute animated toy commercial called The Transformers : The Movie .
Welles lent his voice to Unicron , a planet that could transform into a giant robot in order to destroy other robots and attack Cybertron , the homeworld of the Decepticons and the Autobots .
The film is brisk and largely inoffensive ( and a damn sight less soul - sucking than the big- budget Michael Bay version ) , but there ’s something terribly sad in knowing that the man who gave us Charles Foster Kane and Harry Lime spent his final weeks delivering lines like “ This is my command : You are to destroy the Autobot Matrix of Leadership . ”
There were rumors that Welles died before completing the project , leaving fellow cast - member Leonard Nimoy to fill in the blanks , but the truth is even more depressing ;
Welles finished his role a mere five days before his heart gave out for good .
( Transformers was also Scatman Crothers ’ final role .
Thankfully , Judd Nelson survived his work as Hot Rod . )
15 . Rodney Dangerfield , The Onion Movie ( 2008 )
Rodney Dangerfield was n’t exactly an amazing actor , but he picked his roles perfectly :
There ’s no denying his leading - man ability in Back To School , and he brightens up each of his Caddyshack scenes .
But he went out with a serious whimper and a rehashed joke — and looking very unwell physically , which of course he was .
For some reason , The Onion Movie ends with Dangerfield dressed as his character from Caddyshack , Al Czervik , repeating his final phrase from that movie : “ Hey , everybody !
We ’re all gonna get laid ! ”
It is n’t exactly a joke so much as a nostalgia - stab .
Maybe they should ’ve had him say the hilariously bad sanitized - for - TV version of the line : “ Hey , everybody !
Let ’s all take a shower ! ”
UNIFIL forces in south Lebanon were warned in advance of the possibility that Katyusha rockets would be fired toward Israel , Lebanese newspaper An Nahar reported on Sunday .
Friday afternoon saw two 122 - mllimeter rockets hit open areas in the Western Galilee region .
There were no reports of injuries or damage .
According to the Lebanese newspaper , a number of sources informed UNIFIL of the attack 10 days before it was launched , and even specified they type of rockets that would be fired .
UNIFIL , the report said , relayed the information to the Lebanese army two days before the attack .
The report did not mention whether the Lebanese army had acted on the information .
Israel filed a complaint with the United Nations on Friday evening , saying the Lebanese government was responsible for the incident .
Lebanese news agencies said Saturday that eyewitnesses in southern Lebanon reported that the terrorists who fired Katyusha rockets at Israel arrived on the scene of the launch in a truck , wearing civilian clothing .
The witnesses said four men arrived at a forest near the village of al - Kalila and planted three rockets , then set a timer and fled the scene .
Military sources estimated that Friday 's rocket fire was an isolated incident , which does not indicate a plan by Hezbollah or other Lebanese organizations to escalate the situation in the region .

Bottled Water – It ’s Time to Just Say No
Recently , author Peter Gleick sat down with Fresh Air host Terry Gross to discuss his new book Bottled and Sold , in which he answers a lot of questions about bottled water :
Where does it come from ?
Who regulates it ?
And what happens to all of those plastic bottles ?
Gleick is a water expert who was named a MacArthur fellow in 2003 , so he clearly knows his stuff .
And once you hear what he has to say , it will make it hard to purchase another bottle unless you are literally dying of thirst .

The story of bottled water ( video )
The Story of Bottled Water is co-produced with ﬁve leading sustainability advocacy organizations , including Corporate Accountability International , Environmental Working Group , Food & Water Watch , Polaris Institute and Paciﬁc Institute .
Fortunately , more people are becoming aware about how ridiculous it is to buy plastic bottled water .
A Harris Poll found that 29 % of the people surveyed switched back to the tap this year .
That 's a great sign .
But it does n't stop at just the average consumer .

Cities Promote Tap Water Because It 's Good Policy
One thing about the MN GOP campaign operatives take on Minneapolis ' tap water promotion PR campaign that stands out to me is that they 're pretending that Minneapolis is somehow unique in their efforts to promote tap water .
That 's an absurd assumption since Minneapolis ' tap water situation is not all that unique .
Cities around the world are all dealing with : 1 . Increased bottled water usage , which leads to . . .
2 . Increased stress on the waste stream , which leads to . . .
3 . An increased tax burden . . .
4 . In a time when budgets are being squeezed .
So it makes sense to promote the public utility for a variety of reasons .
There is nothing particularly unique about what Minneapolis is doing .
We 're among the first to move in this direction but we 're far from alone .

In a month or two , I have a new book coming out from Island Press called " Bottled and Sold : The Story Behind Our Obsession with Bottled Water . "
Look for it at your local ... well , wherever you buy books now .
The book is a popular account of the reasons we buy bottled water , the manipulations of the private water bottlers to get us to buy it , the industry war on tap water , the history of weird claims made for bottled water , and much more .
It explores the remarkable explosion in bottled water sales and the recent consumer revolt that is beginning to threaten sales .

The Environmental Impact Of Bottled Water
Sales levels of bottled water have been increasing by around 7 or 8 % annually for the past ten years .
Between 1997 and 2005 , it 's estimated that global consumption of bottled water doubled .
Approximately 200 billion bottles of water are consumed worldwide each year .
The US market is the largest by far , accounting for 25 % of total sales .
There has been quite a backlash against the use of bottled water recently .
The key concern for many being the environmental impact of bottled water .
Polyethyleneterphthalate ( PET ) is the material used for most of these bottles .
It is , to be fair , a material which can be recycled .
The trouble is that recycling levels are estimated at less than 25 % .

What Do You Know About Bottled Water Quality ?
If you are like me and thought that from the recent reports shown on the television that the quality of bottled water is just the same as tap water then I have some news for you .
There are some other interesting things that you should know .
I watched the reports that were coming out awhile ago that said that bottled and tap water were basically the same .
They said that you can get the same quality of water from the tap in your home .
I took this a step further and asked myself , how good is tap water coming into my home ?
That comparison that I just saw is meaningless if the tap water was contaminated .
I started looking into water quality and found that there are a number of contaminants that have been found and that the list has grown to over 2,100 .
Herbicides , pesticides , and drugs are what have generally been found across the U.S.
If the quality of bottled water is the same as tap water then this makes me nervous .

After many drama - filled turbulent years , Peter Sunde , the infamous Pirate Bay spokesman , has resigned .
Citing a complete lack of time , Peter says he wants to concentrate on new things , including several projects and a book .
" I am leaving a role in order to be a person instead , " he said .
In perhaps not a completely unexpected move , Peter Sunde , the public voice of The Pirate Bay , has announced his retirement as site spokesman .
With the sale of The Pirate Bay to Sweden ’s Global Gaming Factory still promised for the final days of August , it ’s doubtful whether his unique blend of abilities would be compatible with their immediate business strategy , if the deal sails through .
But of course , being involved with the running of The Pirate Bay means there is little time for anything else and this is the main reason cited by Peter behind his decision to quit – he wants time to do other things .
“ I want to build something new and I want to focus my energy in a different direction .
I have projects waiting to be finished , a book is waiting to be finalized and many more books are waiting to be read , ” he said .
Touching briefly on the challenges facing the site ’s operators , Peter – who is known to millions of Internet users as brokep – said that they had “ been raised to another level ” adding that it ’s “ time for biological dispersal . ”
Promising not to give up his battle in pressing for a better Internet , Peter says his resignation marks the end of an era , “ .. but I am simply leaving a role in order to be a person instead , ” he said .

We posted earlier about the biology behind the controversy over Caster Semenya ’s sex .
Germán I. R. - E. and Philip Cohen ( who has his own post on the topic ) asked that we comment on her recent makeover .
Some sociologists argue that gender ( as opposed to sex ) is really more about performance than it is about our bodies .
That is , we do gender and , when we do it in ways that other people recognize , everyone feels satisfied .
This is , perhaps , what Caster Semenya ’s handlers were hoping for when she submitted to a makeover for South Africa ’s YOU Magazine :
Notice that Semenya carries the same body into this photoshoot , but she is properly adorned with make up , feminine clothing , jewelry , a passive pose , and a pleasant and inviting facial expression ( because to be feminine is to be accommodating ) .
Perhaps more importantly , the copy and the interview tells the reader that Semenya likes dressing up and looking pretty , another important indicator of both femininity and non-masculinity .
The cover says :
WE TURN SA’S POWER GIRL INTO A GLAMOUR GIRL – AND SHE LOVES IT !
( Notice , too , the implication that power and glamour are opposed . )
This insistence that Semenya feels ( or wants to feel ) feminine , as well as looks it , is mirrored in the text ( as summarized by the Guardian ) :
It carries an interview with the 18 - year - old student .
“ I ’d like to dress up more often and wear dresses but I never get the chance , ” she says .
“ I ’d also like to learn to do my own makeup . ”
The lifestyle magazine quotes Semenya ’s university friends saying that she wants to buy stilettos and have a manicure and pedicure .
Semenya adds : “ I ’ve never bought my own clothes – my mum buys them for me .
But now that I know what I can look like , I ’d like to dress like this more often . ”
You magazine says that , after the photoshoot , Semenya told her manager that she would like to buy all the outfits she had modelled .
So , in the face of the leaked and unconfirmed finding that Semenya has undescended testicles and higher levels of testosterone than the “ average ” woman ( see note at end * ) , there is an assertion here that what matters ( i.e. , the measure of sex that we should attend to ) is her gender identity ( feeling feminine ) and her gender performance ( doing femininity ) .
Anna N. at Jezebel points to how the public interest in Semenya ’s sex may have pressured her , and those around her , to play this gender game .
She writes :
… up until now , Semenya and her family have been unapologetic about the way she looks and dresses .
Her father said that she had always preferred pants , but that she was still a woman — and the idea that she has to put on a dress and lipstick to prove her femaleness to people is pretty depressing .
It is also something that almost all women in Western countries do everyday .
We perform gender , in part out of habit and in part consciously , all the time .
Semenya has n’t cared about this performance and that is at least in part why the controversy over her sex is taking the form that it is .
* Note :
The release of male - related hormones , androgens , is n’t the whole story here .
Cells must also have the relevant receptors for the presence of the hormones to matter .
Semenya likely is lacking some of those receptors , either in her whole body on in parts of her body , because her body obviously did n’t respond to the hormones ( otherwise she would have a penis and scrotum ) .
My point here is dual : ( 1 ) the presence of testicles and testosterone does n’t tell the whole story and ( 2 ) even if we knew the whole story , it does n’t tell us if she is female or male .
What if her body does n’t detect the presence of those androgens ?
What if it reads the presence of some of them , but not others ?
What if she is chimera or mosaic ?
All these are interesting questions biologically , but the answers will not tell us whether she is male or female because sex , like gender , is a social construction .

JERUSALEM ( Reuters ) -
An Israeli submarine sailed the Suez Canal to the Red Sea as part of a naval drill last month , defense sources said on Friday , describing the unusual maneuver as a show of strategic reach in the face of Iran .
Slideshow ( 3 images )
Israel long kept its three Dolphin - class submarines , which are widely assumed to carry nuclear missiles , away from Suez so as not to expose them to the gaze of Egyptian harbormasters .
It was unclear when last month the vessel left the Mediterranean .
One source said the voyage was planned for months and so was not related to unrest after the June 12 re-election of President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , whom the Israelis see as promoting the pursuit of nuclear weapons to threaten them .
Sailing to the Gulf without using Suez would oblige the diesel - fueled Israeli submarines , normally based in the Mediterranean , to circumnavigate Africa -- a weeks - long voyage .
That would have limited use in signaling Israel ’s readiness to retaliate should it ever come under an Iranian nuclear attack .
Shorter - term , the submarines ’ conventional missiles could also be deployed in any Israeli strikes on Iran ’s atomic sites , which Tehran insists have only civilian energy purposes .
A defense source said the Israeli navy held an exercise off Eilat last month and that a Dolphin took part , having traveled to the Red Sea port though Suez .
Israel has a naval base at Eilat , a 10 - km ( 6 - mile ) strip of coast between Egypt and Jordan , but officials say it has no submarine dock there .
“ This was definitely a departure from policy , ” said the source , who declined to give further details on the drill or say whether the Dolphin had undergone Egyptian inspections in the canal , through which the submarine sailed unsubmerged .
A military spokeswoman had no immediate comment on the voyage , first reported on Friday by the Jerusalem Post .
EGYPTIAN POSITION
Egyptian officials at Suez said they would neither confirm nor deny reports regarding military movements .
One official said that if there was such a passage by Israelis in the canal , it would not be problematic as Egypt and Israel are not at war .
Egypt is one of only two Arab states to have signed a peace treaty with Israel , but relations remain cool .
However , Arab states that are allies of the United States appear to share some of Israel ’s concerns about non-Arab Iran ’s nuclear program .
Israel is assumed to have the Middle East ’s only atomic arsenal , but does not discuss this under an “ ambiguity ” policy billed as deterring its enemies while avoiding provocations .
Another Israeli defense source with extensive naval experience said the drill “ showed that we can far more easily access the Indian Ocean , and the Gulf , than before . ”
But the source added : “ If indeed our subs are capable of doing to Iran what they are believed to be capable of doing , then surely this is a capability that can be put into action from the Mediterranean ? ”
Each German - made Dolphin has 10 torpedo tubes , four of them widened at Israel ’s request -- to accommodate , some independent analysts believe , nuclear - tipped cruise missiles .
But there have been questions about whether these would have the 1,500 - km ( 1,000 - mile ) range needed to hit Iran from the Mediterranean .
Israel plans to acquire two more Dolphins early next decade .
Naval analysts say this could allow it to set up a rotation whereby some of the submarines patrol distant shores while others secure the Israeli coast or dock to undergo maintenance .

This is the impression left with the French state secretary for European affairs Mr. Pierre Lellouche who is on a visit in Bulgaria today and met with the Bulgarian prime minister Boyko Borisov .
The meeting lasted longer than planned - 1 hour and 15 minutes , during which they discussed many issues , one of which - energy .
According to Mr. Lellouche , if Bulgaria decides in the future to realise the construction of the second nuclear power station then France will participate actively in the construction , as agreed .
He added that , given the gas dependency of Bulgaria , nuclear energy is one of the solutions .
He reminded that France gains 80 % of the electricity the country consumes from the 62 nuclear reactors .
Besides , Pierre Lellouche said that one of the aims of the French president Nicolas Sarkozy is the cooperation within the EU in the field of nuclear energy to increase .
" We think that Bulgaria should not be left alone when the country has to defy challenges like black - outs because of gas deliveries disruptions .
More globally , I think that all of us should succeed in agreeing on a common Community energy policy by thus decreasing our dependence on suppliers " , the French state secretary added .
The new Bulgarian government has received more credit of confidence by the French government which until recently was very critical to the situation in Bulgaria .
The support is for the efforts of the new cabinet to fight corruption and organised crime .
But he underlined that France will anticipate results right after the moment comes .

PASADENA , Calif. -- NASA 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has revealed frozen water hiding just below the surface of mid-latitude Mars .
The spacecraft 's observations were obtained from orbit after meteorites excavated fresh craters on the Red Planet .
Scientists controlling instruments on the orbiter found bright ice exposed at five Martian sites with new craters that range in depth from approximately half a meter to 2.5 meters ( 1.5 feet to 8 feet ) .
The craters did not exist in earlier images of the same sites .
Some of the craters show a thin layer of bright ice atop darker underlying material .
The bright patches darkened in the weeks following initial observations , as the freshly exposed ice vaporized into the thin Martian atmosphere .
One of the new craters had a bright patch of material large enough for one of the orbiter 's instruments to confirm it is water - ice .
The finds indicate water - ice occurs beneath Mars ' surface halfway between the north pole and the equator , a lower latitude than expected in the Martian climate .
" This ice is a relic of a more humid climate from perhaps just several thousand years ago , " said Shane Byrne of the University of Arizona , Tucson .
Byrne is a member of the team operating the orbiter 's High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment , or HiRISE camera , which captured the unprecedented images .
Byrne and 17 co-authors report the findings in the Sept. 25 edition of the journal Science .
" We now know we can use new impact sites as probes to look for ice in the shallow subsurface , " said Megan Kennedy of Malin Space Science Systems in San Diego , a co-author of the paper and member of the team operating the orbiter 's Context Camera .
During a typical week , the Context Camera returns more than 200 images of Mars that cover a total area greater than California .
The camera team examines each image , sometimes finding dark spots that fresh , small craters make in terrain covered with dust .
Checking earlier photos of the same areas can confirm a feature is new .
The team has found more than 100 fresh impact sites , mostly closer to the equator than the ones that revealed ice .
An image from the camera on Aug. 10 , 2008 , showed apparent cratering that occurred after an image of the same ground was taken 67 days earlier .
The opportunity to study such a fresh impact site prompted a look by the orbiter 's higher resolution camera on Sept. 12 , 2008 , confirming a cluster of small craters .
" Something unusual jumped out , " Byrne said .
" We observed bright material at the bottoms of the craters with a very distinct color .
It looked a lot like ice .
" The bright material at that site did not cover enough area for a spectrometer instrument on the orbiter to determine its composition .
However , a Sept. 18 , 2008 , image of a different mid-latitude site showed a crater that had not existed eight months earlier .
This crater had a larger area of bright material .
" We were excited about it , so we did a quick - turnaround observation , " said co-author Kim Seelos of Johns Hopkins University Applied Physics Laboratory in Laurel , Md. " Everyone thought it was water - ice , but it was important to get the spectrum for confirmation .
" Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter Project Scientist Rich Zurek , of NASA 's Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , Calif. , said , " This mission is designed to facilitate coordination and quick response by the science teams .
That makes it possible to detect and understand rapidly changing features .
" The ice exposed by fresh impacts suggests that NASA 's Viking Lander 2 , digging into mid-latitude Mars in 1976 , might have struck ice if it had dug 10 centimeters ( 4 inches ) deeper .
The Viking 2 mission , which consisted of an orbiter and a lander , launched in September 1975 and became one of the first two space probes to land successfully on the Martian surface .
The Viking 1 and 2 landers characterized the structure and composition of the atmosphere and surface .
They also conducted on - the - spot biological tests for life on another planet .

Advertisement A suicide car bomb has exploded outside the Nato headquarters in the Afghan capital , Kabul , killing up to seven people , the defence ministry says .
The presidential palace and several embassies are also located in the area .
The attack comes ahead of presidential and provincial elections due on Thursday which the Taliban have vowed to disrupt .
The BBC's Martin Patience says a group affiliated to the Taliban is likely to be responsible for the attack .
President Hamid Karzai condemned the attack , saying people would not be deterred from voting .
" The enemies of Afghanistan try to create fear among people in this election period but people still realise the importance of going to ballot boxes to cast their votes , " he said in a statement .
' People screaming ' Initial reports said three people , all Afghan civilians , had been killed and 70 people injured .
The Afghan defence ministry issued a statement later saying that it believed seven people had been killed .
The blast hit the heavily fortified area of the city at about 0830 local time on Saturday .
ANALYSIS Ian Pannell , BBC News , Kabul
This is one of the most heavily guarded streets in Kabul .
You have to go past huge concrete blast walls .
There are men with guns almost everywhere , Afghan forces , international forces .
There are barriers and chicanes .
It is not an easy area to get into .
Security sources are telling us there is n't enough co-ordination between the different security agencies , the Afghan security forces , the police , the special forces and the international forces and that has created a real sense that they are not on top of the security situation .
It is very surprising the attackers were able to get into this area .
Normally you have to show a pass , the car is looked at , the passengers are questioned .
But it seems they were able to get past the first checkpoints and approach the Nato headquarters where the bomb exploded .
" It was a suicide bombing carried out in a car right in front of Isaf [ the Nato - led peacekeeping force ] , " Afghan defence ministry spokesman General Mohammad Zahir Azimi said , speaking from the scene .
Several Isaf soldiers were among the injured .
Sirens blared as police and ambulances rushed to the area which was sealed off by international forces .
" As I was walking into the Nato compound I heard a loud explosion and fell to the ground , " one man , Ahmad , told the BBC .
" People were screaming and I saw flames from the headquarters .
We all left the area , as we were worried there might be a second bomb . "
One of the injured was the female MP Hawa Alam Nuristani , who is also working for President Karzai 's election campaign .
Some of those taken to hospital have been undergoing surgery to treat severe wounds .
The BBC's Martin Patience in Kabul says that , while there is an elaborate security plan to try to keep violence to a minimum ahead of the elections , there will be real concern that there will be more attacks in the city in coming days .
He says that attacks inside the capital are relatively rare but have tended to be big ones .
The last major attack on the capital was in February when several gunmen , some wearing suicide vests , attacked the Ministry of Justice .
In July 2008 , a massive car bomb killed more than 50 Afghans and two diplomats outside the Indian embassy .
These two attacks were believed to have been carried out by a group called the Haqqani network , our correspondent says .
It is named after the veteran Afghan militant Jalaluddin Haqqani , who is based in Pakistan 's North Waziristan region .
He is an old man now and the group is led by his son , Sirajuddin Haqqani .

Some economists are trying to get macroeconomics off the hook by arguing that by their very nature crises are unpredictable .
Thus David Levine aggressively argues that " our models do n't just fail to predict the timing of financial crises – they say that we cannot . "
There are three problems with this argument .
First , it assumes what is it at question – namely whether what Levine calls " our models " are good models .
Perhaps behavioral models could better predict the timing of financial crises .
I will not push this argument but I do believe that current events call for a greater than normal willingness to think beyond the confines of the models that one defends .
Second , it 's not true that " our models " tell us that we can never predict a financial crisis .
In some cases , our models predict the exact moment that a crisis will occur and these models are perfectly consistent with , indeed require , rational expectations .
It is perhaps no accident that Paul Krugman has specialized in these types of models .
Third , the word timing is misleading .
Let 's accept that a crisis cannot be predicted to the day or even to the year .
Nevertheless , it is perfectly reasonably and fully consistent with rational expectations to predict an increased probability of a crisis .
If you play Russian Roulette with 1 bullet and 100 chambers in your pistol , I can't predict when the crisis will occur .
If you play with 10 bullets , I still can't predict when the crisis will occur but I can say with certainty that the risk has increased by a factor of ten .
Analogously , nothing in modern economics makes it theoretically impossible to forecast that greater leverage and higher than normal price to rental rates , to name just two possibilities , increase the probability of crisis .
Nor does modern theory make it theoretically impossible to forecast that conditions are such that if a crisis does occur it will be a big one .
All of this is true even in the context of stock markets .
Efficient markets theory implies that any two stocks will have similar risk - adjusted returns it does not imply that the risk of bankruptcy is the same for any two firms .
It is perfectly reasonable to say that Google revenues are going to have to increase at a historically unprecedented rate or the stock will plummet .
It is even consistent with efficient markets theory to predict that the probability of Google stock falling is much greater than the probability of it rising ( but if it rises it will rise very far , very fast ) .
Thus the " we could not have predicted the crisis even in theory " argument is a weak defense–even with rational - actor , rational - expectations models there are plenty of senses in which economists could have better predicted the crisis and , although this is yet to be seen , perhaps they could and will do even better with other sorts of models .
GOING DOWN : Stripy speed bumps have proved unpopular with north London residents
The 14 humps were installed in a 250 m pedestrianised path in Canonbury , north London , where residents complained that cyclists were racing down the street to avoid traffic on nearby roads .
After a few near misses , tenants complained to estate owners Homes for Islington ( HfI ) who installed the ramps on Douglas Road South - but the yellow and black striped ‘ sleeping policemen ’ have proved unpopular in the community .
Resident Stacey Roswell said : “ Something has to be done but it ’s ridiculous that we ’ve got these horrible humps .
“ They ’re an eyesore and some of them do n’t even go right to the edge so you can cycle round them anyway ! ”
Residents have complained the bumps make the path difficult to navigate for prams and wheelchair users .
HfI defended the traffic calming measure , saying : “ The estate tenants and the residents ’ association wanted the ramps following issues with speeding cyclists on this narrow path which is shared by pedestrians and cyclists .
id Owner ZeniMax Obtains Prey Rights
While the company has yet to make an official statement , superannutation dug up a document that shows Radar Group transferring ownership to ZeniMax in July , backing up an overlooked report from Duke4. net .
More recently , ZeniMax registered the Prey trademark under video games , books , movies , and television shows .
The first Prey ( PC , X360 ) made it to stores in 2006 care of Human Head , which had worked with then - property owner 3D Realms on the long - in - development project .
A sequel was later announced by Radar Group - - a so - called entertainment incubator formed by 3DR exec Scott Miller - - but nothing has been said since .
Going by the USPTO , Radar handed the rights to ZeniMax within a month of getting them from 3DR .

( PhysOrg.com ) --
When a river flows into the sea , the location is more than just a haven for water commerce .
The mixing of fresh and salt water that occurs at an estuary also dissipates energy , as the different salinity waters combine into a state of less - ordered , uniform salinity .
The mixing generates a significant 2.2 kJ of energy per liter of fresh water that flows into the sea .
Scientists have already designed several techniques in an attempt to harvest this energy , and have successfully generated power of about 1 kW for a fresh water flow of 1 liter per second .
But these techniques are usually based on membranes through which the water flows , and problems such as high membrane cost and short lifetime are currently preventing the large - scale utilization of these techniques .
Now , Doriano Brogioli of the University of Milan Bicocca in Monza , Italy , has taken a different approach to extracting energy from salinity difference .
As Brogioli explains in a recent issue of Physical Review Letters , the method is based on electric double - layer ( EDL ) capacitor technology .
“ The main idea is that the potential of an electric double layer depends on ion concentration , ” Brogioli told PhysOrg.com .
“ This concept is implicit in the theories concerning electric double layer ( Gouy - Chapman - Stern theory ) , but it was not explicitly expressed before , and was not experimented .
The scientific background is electrokinetics , which is the field of physics that focuses on ions and charged objects in solutions .
In this sense , my study can help to understand already known phenomena in a new way . ”
The EDL capacitor is made of two porous carbon electrodes immersed in salt water .
The electrodes are then connected to a power supply so that one becomes negatively charged and the other positively charged .
Since salt water consists of positively charged sodium ions and negatively charged chloride ions , the positive electrode attracts the chloride ions and the negative electrode attracts the sodium ions .
With the help of the electrostatic force keeping the oppositely charged ions near their respective electrodes , the EDL capacitor can store a charge .
To extract the charge , fresh water is pumped into the device , causing the sodium and chloride ions to diffuse away from the electrodes against the electrostatic force .
In other words , the work done by the fresh water to extract the salt water is converted into electrostatic energy , appearing as an increase in voltage between the electrodes .
Overall , the system transforms mechanical work ( the mixing of the salt and fresh water ) into electrostatic energy that can be extracted as usable power .
The only energy required by the system is the initial power source to jumpstart the capacitor , and power to pump fresh and salt water into the device .
Brogioli's experiments have shown that the EDL capacitor method is a feasible idea , and he hopes that the experimental device could be scaled up to an industrial - scale system .
He calculates that the method could produce a power output competitive with the 1 kW of membrane - based methods , without the issues of expense and limited lifetime .
Still , the EDL capacitor technique will face challenges of its own , such as the relatively long time it takes to change the solution , which is the main drawback of the method .
Brogioli hopes that improvements , such as a better engineered electrode structure , could further improve the performance of the technique .
If so , extracting energy from salinity difference could be used for a variety of applications , although more work needs to be done before predicting the full potential .
Possible uses include building small plants to power single houses and large plants on the coast in desert regions .
When fully developed , the technique could provide another source of alternative energy , in addition to solar and wind energy .
“ Photovoltaic solar cells are currently very expensive , and my method will be much cheaper , ” Brogioli said .
“ I hope that my method will be similar to wind turbines in terms of energy cost .
On the other hand , wind turbines are less environmentally acceptable ( they are noisy , bad looking , kill birds and cover huge surfaces ) .
When dealing with alternative energy sources , we cannot find a single , global solution , but we must find the best solution for each place .
There are regions where there is no wind , but plenty of fresh water and sea water .
In that place , you can use my method .
In other places , it can be better to use solar energy with a concentration device , for example , or small wind turbines , biofuels , or whatever else , perhaps including fossil fuels or nuclear power .
In this sense , my method is an ‘ alternative ’ to other ‘ alternative ’ energy sources . ”

Obama Kiboshes Bush ’s Iranian Missile Fantasies
by Eric Margolis by Eric Margolis Recently by Eric Margolis : Muammar Qaddafi : Mad Like a Fox
Those growing numbers of foreign policy critics who have been claiming that the Obama administration is simply George W. Bush ’s third term were confounded last week as the new president put the kibosh on one of Bush ’s most beloved and most dimwitted projects .
Obama ’s welcome cancellation of Bush ’s proposed antiballistic missile system ( ABM ) based in Eastern Europe marks a major breakthrough in US - Russian relations , a victory for political realism over ideology , and a sharp defeat for Washington ’s increasingly out - of - touch neoconservative hard right .
Egged on by Vice President Dick Cheney and anti-Russian neoconservatives , Bush declared the US would build a strategic antimissile system on the Czech Republic and Poland designed to shoot down Iranian nuclear - armed intercontinental ballistic missiles ( ICBM ’s ) targeted on the US and Europe — even though Iran did not have any long - ranged missiles and was unlikely to ever produce them .
Bush ’s bizarre plan — some called it the mutant son of President Ronald Reagan ’s cherished Star Wars antimissile program — predictably enraged Russia .
Imagine America ’s reaction if a Russian antimissile system were built in Cuba or Northern Mexico .
The proposed US ABM system posed no real threat to Russia , but it was a slap in the face to the Kremlin and an intolerable provocation .
What ’s more , no one was sure of the new system would even work in the event of any attack .
It looked awfully easy to sabotage or spoof .
Worse , the Bush White House was dangerously provoking Russia , which had some 2,000 nuclear warheads targeted on the US , by planning to deploy the ABM system against Iran which , according to US intelligence , had no nuclear weapons and showed no signs of planning to produce them .
Deepening the confrontation with Moscow , the Bush administration openly backed Georgia in the foolish conflict it picked with Russia , raising dangerous tensions between the two great powers .
Scrapping the ABM system will allow Washington and Moscow to restore their battered relations and resume fruitful arms limitation cooperation .
Maintaining normal relations with Moscow , and avoiding tensions that could spark a nuclear war , remains Washington ’s most important foreign policy strategic imperative .
Conservative Czech and Polish politicians are loudly complaining , but opinion polls show that a majority of their citizens opposed Bush ’s ABM plan .
Cries by US Republicans and neoconservatives that Obama ’s scrapping of the ABM system was " appeasement " and " a second Munich " are laughable .
Sen .
John McCain , a big booster of US invasions of Afghanistan , Iraq and Somalia , actually had the chutzpah to accuse Russia of " adventurism . "
World War II mythology has become something of a state religion for faintly informed Republicans .
Many actually believe that Muslims are Nazis in turbans .
These were the same Republicans that backed George Bush ’s comical claims that Saddam ’s Iraq was deploying " drones of death ’ — shades of Dr. Fu Manchu — that would sprinkle plague powder over a sleeping America .
By contrast , President Obama has faced reality .
The US seeks Russia ’s support to impose crushing sanctions on Iran — or launch military operations .
Washington needs Moscow ’s support in supplying US forces in Afghanistan , and dealing with North Korea .
Bush ’s pie in the sky missile plan had to go .
It is an old adage that American administrations can only deal with one big question at a time .
Obama faces three : America ’s financial meltdown , Iran , and Afghanistan , where US generals are actually warning of possible defeat at the hands of lightly armed Pashtun tribesmen .
Barack Obama knows the mess in Afghanistan could wreck his presidency , humiliate the United States , and even return the Republicans to power .
So there is no time right now to worry about Eastern Europe , and no stomach in the administration to go on provoking Russia over unneeded ABM systems or the Caucasus .
Ironically , Russia may eventually have to save the US in Afghanistan from the same kind of catastrophic defeat that befell the USSR .
We can be sure Moscow will exact a steep price for pulling America ’s chestnuts out of the Afghan fire or getting tougher with Iran .
Moscow is already three moves ahead of Washington on the strategic chessboard .
To mollify angry Republicans and East European conservatives , the White House announced it would deploy smaller SM - 3 antimissile missiles and perhaps some updated PAC - 3 systems to Europe .
The SM - 3 ’s would be based at sea and others on land to protect against the supposed Iranian " threat . "
Not explained was why Iran would risk nuclear annihilation in order to fire a few inaccurate missiles at Bucharest , Brussels or Warsaw .
Why on earth would Iran attack Europe , its largest trading partner and potential ally ?
The only possible target for Iran in Europe would be US bases .
But there are a wide number of US bases around Iran .
Tehran has ample targets close to home .
The White House sheepishly admitted Bush ’s much ballyhooed threat of long - ranged Iranian missiles had been " exaggerated . "
The danger , said Washington , now comes from short and medium - ranged Iranian missiles .
But Iran ’s longest - ranged missiles fly only 2,000 km , are inaccurate , and lack nuclear warheads .
For now , they are about as dangerous as Saddam ’s useless Scuds .
But a lot of Americans do n’t want to hear any sense about Iran .
We seem to have a national need for highly threatening foreign foes , real or imagined .

Women hedge , issue disclaimers and ask questions when they communicate , language features that can suggest uncertainty , lack of confidence and low status .
But men do the same , according to new research from the University of California , Davis .
" It 's a stereotype that men are direct while women are tentative .
I debunk that stereotype , " said Nicholas Palomares , assistant professor of communication at UC Davis .
Palomares reports his findings in " Women Are Sort of More Tentative Than Men , Are n't They ? , " an article in the August issue of the journal Communication Research .
" I found that women are more tentative than men sometimes , and men are more tentative than women sometimes , " Palomares said .
" It depends on the topic and whether you 're communicating with someone of the same gender .
Gender differences in language are not innate ; they ’re fickle . "
In his study , Palomares asked nearly 300 UC Davis undergraduates -- about half of them female and half male -- to write e-mails explaining how to change a flat tire or buy make - up , among other gender - stereotyped and gender - neutral topics .
Students were given the name and gender of the person they were e-mailing .
Men were tentative when writing about make - up or other stereotypically feminine topics , especially when they thought they were writing to a woman , he found .
For example , one man , believing he was corresponding with a woman , wrote : " … maybe girls prefer the quality of products at Sephora over other major department stores ?
I do n't know . "
Women were tentative when writing about changing flat tires and other stereotypically masculine topics , especially when they thought they were writing to a man .
For example , one woman , believing she was giving instructions to a man , wrote : " I think they start out by raising the whole car , or maybe just the one tire with a tire jack ? "
Language was judged tentative if it included " hedges " ( sort of , maybe , pretty much , probably , might , kinda ) , " disclaimers " ( I 'm not sure , I may be wrong , do n't trust me , but you should double - check ) or " tag questions " ( do n't you think ?
is n't it ? right ? ) .
Palomares found no gender difference in tentativeness when he asked his subjects to write e-mails about gender - neutral topics , such as recommending a good restaurant .
His conclusion :
Some topics cause men and women to think and communicate in terms of their gender , which leads to tentativeness when the topic is inconsistent with their gender .
" The metaphor that men and women are from different planets should be jettisoned and replaced with a more accurate one , " Palomares writes in his article .
" Men and women are from different blocks in the same neighborhood , and they tend to move often . "
The article is subtitled " How Men and Women Use Tentative Language Differently , Similarly , and Counter - stereotypically as a Function of Gender Salience . "

Google has announced today that they will use XMPP as a synchronization protocol for Chrome browser .
Web surfers nowadays use many browsers on different machines , even on small devices like smartphones .
They obviously need a way to gather together all these sparse data ( like bookmarks , passwords , history , etc. ) and make them available from any browser at any time .
Two of the largest internet players today provide two different approaches , both at the same experimental state :
Mozilla with Weave , a product from its labs , providing a Firefox extension , a opensource server implementation , and a documented protocol
Google will offer a Chrome feature , Google Talk server , Google account , and maybe a documented protocol , since the code is opensource
It is possible to provide browser data sync client as a cross - browser extension or plugin , a server component which would rely on an existing XMPP server and account of your choice , and a protocol which could well be Bookmarks , Message Archiving , or Persistent Storage of Public and Private Data via PubSub .
This shows the ongoing effort of Google to use XMPP : Talk and Jingle , GMail notifications , Wave , and now data sync .
With Google and Apple using XMPP for its notifications service , XMPP shows itself as a strong infrastructure for a wide array of applications beyond the simple chat .
QUEBEC CITY–The Quebec government is accusing organizers of an event commemorating the 1759 battle of the Plains of Abraham of being apologists for hate and terrorism for including a passage from an FLQ manifesto .
Sam Hamad , the provincial minister responsible for the provincial capital region , said yesterday the government will have nothing to do with the event to be held Sept. 12-13 .
Hamad was particularly critical of organizers for including a reading of the Front de libération du Québec manifesto .
The FLQ , which conducted bombing campaigns and kidnappings in support of Quebec independence , triggered a national panic with the October Crisis of 1970 .
Its manifesto was a lengthy left - wing screed against the ills of capitalism , sprinkled with several denunciations of English dominance over francophone Quebecers .
" This is far from poetry , " Hamad said .
" The FLQ for me , the memories I have , are of assassinations , of bombs . "
He also chastised organizers for including Patrick Bourgeoys , of the Réseau de résistance du Québécois , which Hamad said had made calls for violence .
In 1970 , the FLQ kidnapped British diplomat James Cross and Quebec labour minister Pierre Laporte .
Cross was eventually freed but Laporte was found murdered .
Hamad said the organizers have dampened the pride Quebec City felt after its successful 400th anniversary celebrations " by encouraging the people in the FLQ . "
This is only the latest controversy surrounding the anniversary of the historic Plains battle .
The show marking the 250th anniversary was meant to replace a planned re-enactment that was cancelled by federal officials , who cited protests and security concerns .
The lineup of guests includes some of the leaders of Quebec 's sovereignty movement , including Parti Québécois Leader Pauline Marois and Bloc Québécois Leader Gilles Duceppe .
Descendents of the generals in the battle – Britain 's James Wolfe and France 's Louis - Joseph de Montcalm of France – will read letters from their ancestors .
Besides readings from works by the Jesuits and Jacques Cartier , passages will also be read from The Street , a collection of short stories by Mordecai Richler , an author who regularly skewered nationalists .

Gordon Brown declined to press Colonel Muammar Gaddafi for compensation for IRA bomb victims out of concern that a ministerial intervention might upset relations with Libya , it emerged today .
Last year the Prime Minister met campaigners seeking a cash payout from the Gaddafi regime , which supplied Semtex explosives used by republican bomb - makers .
But he told their lawyer in a letter last October that he did not consider it " appropriate " for the Government to enter bilateral talks with Libya on the matter , citing the need for continued co-operation from the north African state on issues like terrorism .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
In a letter to the victims ' lawyer Jason McCue , obtained by the Sunday Times , Mr Brown insisted that trade was not the " core reason " for his decision , but acknowledged that that it did now form a part of the UK - Libya relationship .
Downing Street rejected suggestions that Mr Brown 's decision was driven by the desire to avoid derailing lucrative potential oil deals involving British companies .
" As the Prime Minister makes absolutely clear in his letter to Mr McCue , trade considerations were not a factor in the Government 's decision that it would not be appropriate to enter into direct negotiations with Libya on this issue , " said a spokesman for Number 10 .
" The Prime Minister is sympathetic to the case put forward by the families of victims of IRA atrocities and met with a group representing them in December to listen to their concerns . "
In his letter , dated October 7 , 2008 , Mr Brown said : " The UK government does not consider it appropriate to enter into a bilateral discussion with Libya on this matter . "
He insisted that " trade " was not the " core reason " for his decision , adding : " While the UK - Libya relationship does indeed include trade , bilateral co-operation is now wide - ranging on many levels , particularly in the fight against terrorism .
I believe it is in all our interests for this co-operation to continue . "
The Sunday Times also published a letter sent in November 2008 by the then Foreign Office minister Bill Rammell to Jonathan Ganesh , who was injured in the 1996 Docklands bomb and now campaigns for IRA victims .

In it , the minister identified Libya 's role in providing for Britain 's future energy needs as a key element of the increasingly close partnership between the countries .
Mr Rammell wrote : " Libya is now a vital partner for the UK in guaranteeing a secure energy future for the UK and is also a key partner in the fight against terrorism .
" While I recognise that this will be of little comfort to you , it is vital for the UK 's present and future security that this continues . "
In a later letter dated January 13 2009 to Democratic Unionist MP Jeffrey Donaldson , Mr Rammell said : " Libya 's relations with the United Kingdom have developed in recent years to a point where we liaise in a number of wide - ranging areas including energy and counter - terrorism . "
A Foreign Office spokesman confirmed that Mr Rammell 's letters were genuine , adding : " As Bill Rammell points out in his letter , the Libyans have told us that they consider the matter closed .
" As the Prime Minister said on Wednesday , relationships between Libya and Britain matter for the security of our country .
Libya has become a genuine strategic partner for the UK since its move away from nuclear proliferation and the restoration of diplomatic relations .
" It is in this context that Bill Rammell explains , as the Prime Minister did on Wednesday , that co-operation with Libya is important . "
Speaking on Wednesday about the decision to release Lockerbie bomber Abdelbaset Al Megrahi , Mr Brown said that defeating terrorism and preventing nuclear proliferation were at the core of Britain 's international policy , adding : " While we welcome our strategic relationship with Libya , it is these concerns - not oil or commercial interests - that have been the dominant feature of our relationship . "
A Northern Ireland MP today demanded the Prime Minister tells him why he was not prepared to stand up for IRA victims in the same way former US President George Bush did for American terror victims .
Jeffrey Donaldson , the Democratic Unionist MP for Lagan Valley said : " I want to know and the people of Northern Ireland will want to know why Gordon Brown does n't have the same desire to stand up for the victims of IRA terrorism as George Bush showed in standing up for the American victims .
" He got a multi-billion dollar deal in terms of compensation from the Libyans . "
Mr Donaldson is part of a cross-party group of MPs preparing to travel to Tripoli for face to face talks with Libyan authorities about compensation for victims of IRA violence .
He had talks with Foreign Office officials last week in preparation for the trip on which he is expected to be joined by party colleague , Nigel Dodds - the Northern Ireland Finance Minister - as well as Labour MP Andrew Mackinlay and Conservative Daniel Kawczynski .
" We believe that it is important that the Libyan government hears first hand why they have a moral obligation to the victims of the IRA .
" Many towns and cities across the UK were badly damaged by the Semtex the supplied and hundreds of lives lost , " said Mr Dodds .

Holidaymakers could be fined thousands of pounds - or even jailed - for buying fake designer goods when abroad , copyright lawyers are warning .
Authorities in France and Italy are not just targeting those who produce and sell fakes but also those who buy them .
In France , the maximum fine is 300,000 euro ( £ 260,000 ) or three years in jail .
The UK government has decided against criminalising consumers .
Instead it has launched an information campaign aimed at people using markets and boot sales .
Seizures of counterfeit goods on the continent more than doubled in 2008 , with customs authorities seizing 178 million fake items - mostly imported from China .
The European Commission is concerned about the growing involvement of organised international criminal gangs .
These are not cheeky chappies making an honest living on a Sunday morning , these are hardened criminals
Susie Winter
Alliance Against Intellectual Property Theft
It says : " Without doubt , one of the principal methods of dispersing counterfeits is the ' ant - like ' traffic of tourists returning home from holiday , bringing back souvenirs . "
This has prompted some member states to take a harder line .
Intellectual property lawyer Simon Tracey said anyone tempted to bring back items such as fake designer sunglasses , a football top or handbag from their holidays should beware .
He said lots of people have already been fined thousands of euros for owning a fake , and France seemed " a little bit harsher " than Italy .
Dangerous fakes
But he said it was hard to persuade people that owning a fake was " a bad thing " .
" The problem is , it is an intellectual theft , so therefore it 's much harder to explain to people that it is wrong , but in reality - as a matter of social responsibility - it is just as bad as stealing .
" We all tend to debate the fake bag , we tend not to think about the products that can cause serious harm or kill like fake pharmaceuticals , " he added .
HAVE YOUR SAY
If you own an original product the differences actually stand out a mile , particularly on watches .
Conan Hayes , London John Tuchier , from the Trading Standards Institute , said holidaymakers can easily be caught out by things that " look like a bargain " , and shoppers should consider the " safety and quality of a product " .
" Some of these counterfeit goods are so good that you might not be aware that the product is counterfeit until an expert actually looks at it and brings it to your attention , " he said .
The UK government says legitimate businesses lose an estimated £ 10bn a year to counterfeiters , with £ 9bn ending up the hands of gangs .
It also warns that fake alcohol can cause blindness or death , copied toiletries can be harmful and that counterfeit toys or medicines will not have passed safety tests .
Susie Winter , director general of the Alliance Against Intellectual Property Theft - a grouping of creative industry associations , said the UK 's counterfeit trade centred around markets .
" We would urge people to think about where their money is going , " she said .
" These are not cheeky chappies making an honest living on a Sunday morning , these are hardened criminals . "
Many organised criminal gangs exploit child labour , she added .

The National Hockey League Players ’ Association has relieved Paul Kelly of his duties as executive director less than two years into his tenure .
According to many , the NHLPA also may have signed a death warrant for themselves , the NHL and the game of hockey — because Kelly was looked upon as the first “ true , clean ” leader they ever had .
“ This is a very sad day for hockey , ” Hall of Fame hockey scribe and former Lawrence Eagle Tribune NHL and Bruins beat writer Russ Conway told NESN.com on Monday .
“ Unfortunately , the union continues to drink the Kool - Aid . ”
Conway — who was responsible for bringing former NHLPA head Alan Eagleson to justice with his best - selling book , Game Misconduct : Alan Eagleson and the Corruption of Hockey — knows the NHLPA inside out , and he is right on the money .
Many players claim they are not kept in the loop with regard to what goes on with NHLPA matters — some even acknowledge they really do n’t care to know but just want to play hockey .
That ’s all fine and refreshing to hear to an extent , except when something like this latest NHLPA debacle occurs .
Kelly had been praised for his passion for the game , for the players and for trying to clean up what had been a very troubled and corrupt past .
His predecessor , Ted Saskin , was fired for secretly monitoring players ’ e-mails , and the NHLPA ’s first leader , Eagleson — whom Kelly successfully prosecuted and sent to jail ( with Conway ’s help ) on fraud charges — stole money from the players and the union .
Since Kelly took over on Oct. 24 , 2007 , the NHLPA appeared to be in harmony , or was at least more harmonious than in the past .
But in recent months , a group consisting of the union ’s legal counsel — Ian Penny , ombudsman Buzz Hargrove and chairman of the union ’s advisory board Ron Pink — built a list of concerns regarding Kelly ’s leadership .
The purpose of this list was to ultimately convince the 30 - member board of player reps to oust Kelly from his position with the union , which they did successfully during a lengthy meeting that ran from late Sunday afternoon until early Monday morning .
The NHLPA executive board made the announcement at their annual meetings in Chicago late Monday morning : “ Following the executive board ’s review of the overall operation of the NHLPA , it was decided that Paul Kelly should no longer continue to serve as executive director .
We appreciate Mr. Kelly ’s service to our association . ”
The union named Penny as the interim executive director , and a search has begun for a full - time replacement .
Sources close to the situation told NESN.com that former NHLPA associate counsel Ian Pulver , Penny and Pink are the leading candidates to take over as executive director .
Former ombudsman Eric Lindros , who is rumored to be the driving force behind Kelly ’s ouster ( because Kelly reportedly forced Lindros to resign in February ) , is also expected to come back into the fold as well .
Hargrove , Penny , Pink , Pulver and Lindros represent the old guard of the NHLPA , one that was confrontational , hard - lined and more concerned with money than the overall well - being of the union and the game .
They come from a time when chaos and greed ruled the players ’ association and still believe the union conceded too much after the 2004 - 05 lockout .
Ironically , Kelly , who has become the scapegoat for those concessions , had nothing to do with negotiating the current collective bargaining agreement , while Penny was one of the main lawyers involved .
But this group decided to tarnish Kelly ’s image with the players by pointing to what they believe was too cozy a relationship between Kelly and NHL commissioner Gary Bettman and deputy commissioner Bill Daly .
Hargrove , Penny and Pink also claim that Kelly never made enough effort to get to know the players and members of the union .
According to sources , part of this group ’s desire to get rid of Kelly also stemmed from Kelly ordering an internal audit ( by a top former FBI forensic accountant ) of the players ' association 's expenses during the previous three years before he took over .
That audit was still ongoing prior to Kelly ’s dismissal .
Sources claim that through the audit , Kelly discovered that then - interim leaders Penny and Lindros were spending millions of dollars of the union ’s money .
Lindros ended up resigning , but word is , that move fueled this attack on Kelly , and Lindros was very much involved .
Kelly also beat out Pink for the executive director job , and the belief is that Pink is still sour over that .
As Ken Campbell of the Hockey News pointed out prior to the firing , this move could be a colossal mistake by the players .
Besides his impressive resume , Kelly has been anything but what he is accused of being by the group that forced him out .
In an interview earlier this month , Kelly told NESN.com that one of his favorite parts of the job is meeting with and being with the players .
When asked about Kelly , many players that have met him claim he seems very sincere and passionate about his job and the well - being of the players .
Kelly also claimed in that interview that he does n’t want to see another work stoppage .
“ I am determined to use whatever options are available to me to avoid another lockout or a strike , ” he said .
“ You never like to say never , but I realize what damage it would do for the sport and the grief it would cause on the ice and in the stands .
We will do everything in our power to make sure it does n’t happen again . ”
Instead of satisfying the union with that stance , Hargrove , Penny , Pink and Lindros used Kelly ’s words against him .
They said Kelly should do whatever is necessary to get the best deal for the players and if that means another work stoppage , so be it .
“ These guys could really care less about whether the game and the NHL take another PR hit with a work stoppage , ” one source told Murphy ’s Law on Sunday .
“ They ’re more concerned with making money .
They had a cozy setup before Kelly came in and found out what was going on .
He has done his best to clean things up and distance the union from its troubled past .
Unfortunately , part of that cleaning up should ’ve been a housecleaning — because now these guys are conspiring against him .
This is simply crazy . ”
This same source also said that the majority of the board was unaware of this proposal to oust Kelly until a story by TSN ’s Darren Dreger on Thursday night .
“ This was just a scheduled meeting to update the players on certain issues and just simple stuff to discuss , ” said the source .
“ Now they come in and probably some of them are not as connected as others , and they could be duped into voting out probably the best leader they ’ve ever had . ”
Unfortunately , as Conway pointed out , the 30 player reps that voted Kelly out Monday did n’t realize or appreciate what they had in Kelly .
A hard - liner will now take over , and the cold war between the NHL and the NHLPA will resume .
When the current collective bargaining agreement expires on Sept. 15 , 2011 , fans may be in for some more wrangling between the union and the NHL .
With just days to go before the BitTorrent piracy case involving Aussie ISP iiNet goes to court , anti-piracy group AFACT has made a second significant legal retreat .
The group , which represents Hollywood movie studios , has now dropped its claims that iiNet engaged in primary acts of copyright infringement .
Next week the case of Village Roadshow , Universal Pictures , Warner Bros Entertainment , Paramount Pictures , Sony Pictures Entertainment , Twentieth Century Fox Film Corporation , Disney Enterprises , Inc. and the Seven Network ( all under the umbrella of AFACT ) , against Australian ISP iiNet will finally get to court .
AFACT ’s position in the case – officially known as Roadshow Films Pty Ltd & Ors v iiNet Ltd – is that iiNet “ failed to take reasonable steps , including enforcing its own terms and conditions , to prevent known unauthorized use of copies of the companies ’ films and TV programs by iiNet ’s customers via its network . ”
AFACT previously demanded disconnection for those iiNet subscribers alleged to have infringed their copyrights by sharing material using BitTorrent .
iiNet refused to comply and legal action against them followed .
In addition to AFACT ’s assertion that iiNet committed secondary acts of infringement , i.e it is responsible for the copyright infringing actions of its subscribers ( something it denies ) , AFACT had earlier claimed that iiNet engaged in primary infringement too .
Now , just days before the trial begins , AFACT has withdrawn this key part of its claim against iiNet .
The ridiculously optimistic primary infringement claim centered around AFACT ’s assertion that iiNet cached the illicit content being shared by their file - sharing customers on their own network , which effectively turned the ISP into a distributor of copyright works .
Of course , this is how all ISPs and indeed the Internet works – by simply copying digital data from one place to another .
A spokesman for iiNet told AustralianIT that the withdrawal indicated that AFACT ’s legal team had earlier “ fundamentally misunderstood ” how an ISP works and had been “ clutching at straws ” .
Indeed , it is very difficult to disagree with this assessment , but AFACT remains upbeat .
“ The authorization part of the case , which says iiNet failed to prevent online copyright theft of customers , has always been the main part of the case .
The cache and conversion claims were always subsidiary , ” said an AFACT spokesperson .
This is n’t the first time that AFACT has removed a key claim against iiNet .
Earlier the anti-piracy group alleged iiNet was a primary copyright infringer and directly responsible when it refused to disconnect alleged pirates within its subscriber base .
The allegation , know as “ conversion ” , is that iiNet interfered with the studio’s “ right of possession ” , a breach of their rights .
It was later withdrawn .
The outcome of the case will be hugely significant in Australia .
If AFACT wins , all ISPs in Australia could be held legally liable if they are made aware of copyright infringers on their network yet fail to take action against them .
So , Time movie critic Richard Corliss , in a review of Park Chan - wook ’s
Thirst , decided to take the opportunity to expound on why vampires are better than zombies as a lead in to his review .
Why he felt the need to defame the good zombie name , I am not sure , but what he ended up proving is a ) he knows basically nothing about zombies , b ) he has little idea what is actually scary in a movie and c ) zombies are infinitely better than vampires , by the very criteria he has selected .
Corliss starts out with this tepid intro : “ You ’ve heard the propaganda : Zombies Are the New Vampires .
Once relegated to back - list B movies like I Walked With a Zombie and Night of the Living Dead , those slow - moving , post - mortem drudges of West African mythic origin are now the hot horror creature . ”
Okay , Corliss .
I Walked with a Zombie may have been a B - picture , but it ’s since been validated as something of a classic .
And Night of the Living Dead ?
Not only was it not a B - movie ( it was an early indie , to be accurate , created entirely outside of Hollywood ) you ’re also talking about what is almost universally recognized as the second most important and influential horror movie ever ( second only to Psycho ) .
Not an auspicious start to your argument .
From there , he offers what he seems to believe is an argument for the vampire ’s primacy , but ends up being merely a list of reasons that vampires , well … suck .
Here ’s the relevant material :
Zombies are what we feel like at our worst : slogging through a winter workday , standing in a long line at airport security , waking up with a hangover .
Vampires speak to the romantic in us , to our need for human contact , teeth to neck .
They embody everything erotic about the predatory impulse .
Vampires glide through the night and , instead of breaking down your door like an angry zombie mob , they glide into your bedroom for a late - night tryst .
They do n’t rip a victim ’s limbs off ; they leave two decorous little puncture marks on the neck or breast .
But once they get into your system , you ’re theirs forever â€ ” unlike a zombie , whom you can escape just by walking briskly in the opposite direction .
Vampires have savoir - faire and star quality ; a vampire is Johnny Depp , a zombie John C. Reilly .
And they ’re always impeccably dressed .
What do zombies wear ?
Rags !
Not to sound elitist , but zombies are just rabble .
Vampires always have been , always will be , the aristocrats of monsters .
See , that ’s exactly why vampires , as typically portrayed , are n’t fucking scary .
That ’s not a nightmare , that ’s a thirteen - year - old girl ’s wet dream .
Sexuality as reduced to “ decorous little puncture marks on the neck or breast . ”
That ’s not horror .
That ’s the kind of sanitized bullshit that makes garbage like Twilight so popular .
It ’s that kind of “ ooh , sexy ” approach that has stripped the vampire of its power to scare and turned it into a BDSM - lite fetish symbol for the pubescent set .
His other points are equally ridiculous .
If you think you can escape a zombie mob by “ walking briskly in the opposite direction ” you not only have n’t seen a zombie movie in about ten years , but you did n’t pay a lot of attention to the ones you did watch ( p.s. hope you have a better plan than that for when the inevitable zombie apocalypse occurs , Corliss .
Maybe your vampire buddies can help you out … ) .
And what does he offer as an example of the embodiment of vampire ?
Johnny fucking Depp ?
So not scary , unless you suffer severe gay panic when you see an exceptionally pretty man .
On the other hand , the image he chooses as a zombie representative , viewed in the proper context is actually pretty horrific .
Picture a dead - eyed , hungry looking John C. Reilly , dressed in rags , missing a limb and dripping blood and viscera from his mouth — now that ’s a fucking nightmare .

For those of you who can afford it , but who have n’t done so yet , I ’d suggest getting a subscription to the L2 section of Chris Bergin’sNASASpaceflight.com forum .
They ’ve typically been well ahead of the ball on several of the major NASA CxP stories that have broken over the last few years .
And a lot of their work involves more than just calling up the NASA Public Affairs Office and then repeating their talking points verbatim and calling it investigative journalism .
One of the latest gems , which by itself would make an L2 subscription worthwhile ( if you ’re interested in the Constellation Program ) , is the release of 11 of the 12 ESAS Appendices ( the one containing financial data on various launchers has some proprietary data in it , so it was n’t able to be posted ) .
These are where a lot of the methodology , data , and ground assumptions for the ESAS study were documented .
Doug Stanley had referenced them during some of his Q&A threads there on the NSF forums , and originally they were supposed to be publicly released , but NASA decided not to release any of them , even though only one part had sensitive information .
Now , having seen some of what ’s in them ( I ’ve mostly been focusing on the 300 + page appendix to Chapter 6 , that details all of their launch vehicle related decisions ) , I can understand why some people might not want that data to see the light of day .
I was hoping to get permission to post a screenshot or two and some direct quotes , but for now you ’ll have to get a subscription and check it out yourself .
Some gems to look for when you get a chance , all within the first 40 pages :
Exceptions given in the ground rules and assumptions on maximum dynamic pressures to In - line SRM based crew launch concepts that were n’t given to any other vehicles ( without the exception , all of the five - segment Stick concepts would ’ve been ruled out from the start ) .
Unrealistically assuming a fixed LAS mass regardless of first stage characteristics ( like T/W , max - Q , and whether you can shut them down or not ) .
Inaccurate dry mass numbers for existing EELV upper stages ( just as some of the guys on NASASpaceflight.com had been saying for years now ) .
And more .
I hope someone can get NASA to finally release these publicly , because these discrepencies need to be explained .
Hopefully if NASA ever does a study like this again in the future , they ’ll be more open along the way , and thus expose themselves to less negative feedback when their data finally does see the light of day .

A partial view of the lenga 's forest taken from the base of Perito Moreno glacier in 2008 in Patagonia , Argentina .
Argentina has lost nearly 70 percent of its forests in a century , the Environmental Secretariat said at a UN conference on desertification .
Argentina has lost nearly 70 percent of its forests in a century , the Environmental Secretariat said at a UN conference on desertification .
Forests that spread across 100 million hectares ( 247 million acres ) in 1900 have dwindled to 33.19 million hectares ( 82 million acres ) , officials said .
" In 100 years , we have lost between 60 and 70 percent of our forest heritage , " Environmental Undersecretary Sergio La Rocca told reporters on Friday .
Forest destruction has accelerated in the past 10 years with the boom of soy crops , a major motor of growth in Argentina , the top exporter of soy flour and oil and the third - largest exporter of soy seeds .
The northern province of Salta alone lost 26 percent of its forests in the past 30 years , according to a study by the College of Agronomics at the University of Buenos Aires ( UBA ) .
The UBA study found that in 2007 , " the highest rate was reached : 2.1 percent of forests destroyed in a single year . "
Faced with the breadth of the devastation in the province , the Supreme Court ordered a halt to deforestation in natural forests , following an appeal by indigenous populations .
The move ran counter to the provincial authorities , which had authorized forest exploitation .
La Rocca spoke at the ninth session of the conference of parties to the United Nations Convention to Combat Desertification ( UNCDD ) in Buenos Aires .
The scourge of desertification directly affects 200 million people , according to UN figures .
Buenos Aires will host the 23rd World Forestry Congress October 18 - 23 , a forum where governments , civil society and the private sector exchange views to formulate forestry policy .

It ’s been quite a while since we ’ve had a new Edge Rails post .
I ’ve really missed them and there have been a lot of changes , both big and small , on the Edge in the time since .
In this post I ’ll cover a little bit of everything that ’s been happening over the past week or so in Rails .
Along with this , you should expect to see more frequent and regular updates on all that is currently going on .
Goodbye SQLite dbfile
This is a relatively minor change , unless you still refer to your SQLite database as a dbfile in your database .
yml .
The dbfile option key is now gone , having been replaced a long time ago by the more standard , database key .
So , if you ’re suddenly seeing , “ No database file specified ” errors after you update , this may be your cause .

Sava Chankov provided a patch fixing Content - length HTTP response headers being incorrectly calculated with Ruby 1.9 and multi- byte characters .
The content length is now calculated based off of the String # bytesize rather than just the String #size .
This takes advantage of the multi - byte character support built in to Ruby 1.9 , just as long as you remember to always properly tag your multi- byte file with the correct encoding header ( i.e. # encoding : utf - 8 ) .
That ’s not our job
Some spring cleaning , mostly made possible through Rack support , allowed Edge to hand - off some additional responsibilities to the stack .
The most interesting of which is now off - loading some of the content - length calculation to your web server rather than being processed directly from within Rails .
The largest benefit of this is not so much for the application developers as for you middleware developers .
This means that you no longer have to re-calculate the content length when manipulating the body of an HTTP response .
This does not appear to affect the previously mentioned update by Sava , because his fix seems to most largely affect streaming file responses directly through Rails .
We < 3 the Hash , and now so does the Cache
Cache control is now being handled by an internal Hash rather than independent string values .
Old and busted : headers [ ' Cache - Control ' ] = ' private ' , new hotness : response.cache_control [:public ] = true .
Additional cache_control options include : : public , : max_age , : must_revalidate , and the oh - so - descriptive : extras , which is used mostly for your custom header content .
What time is it !?
Geoff Buesing provided a useful fix for Time , specifically when used in conjunction with ActiveRecord .
Now you can save and search ActiveRecord objects using whichever local time zone you like , regardless of what your default time zone is configured for and everything now will just work .
You no longer need to be concerned about converting your user ’s local time into your default application time or vice versa .
It ’s STATE of the art
ActiveRecord now has easy access to ActiveModel ’s StateMachine implementation .
I do n’t know about you , but somehow I always seem to find a way to bring state machines into my Rails applications , and now building in - even fairly complex - state machines just got a whole lot easier .
For an example of ActiveModel : : StateMachine and to get an idea of how you might use it , check out my more detailed blog post over at Envy Labs .
Front .
Back .
Side to side .
Paul Gillard committed a patch which now allows for both custom suffixes ( which really is n’t new ) and prefixes ( omg THAT IS ! ) on your ActiveRecord attributes .
This gives you access to attribute_method_prefix , attribute_method_suffix , and now attribute_method_affix .
While it may sound a little silly , check this out :
class Person < ActiveRecord :: Base attribute_method_affix : prefix => ' me_mateys_ ' , : suffix => ' _is_in_pirate ? ' private def me_mateys_attribute_is_in_pirate ?( attr ) send ( attr ) .to_s =~ /\bYAR\b / i end end person = Person.find (1 ) person.name #=> ' Paul Gillard ' person.profession #=> ' A Pirate , yar !' person.me_mateys_name_is_in_pirate ? #= > false person.me_mateys_profession_is_in_pirate ?
#=> true
Okay , well , that ’s still a little silly , but hopefully you get the idea and can think of a few usage scenarios of your own .
So , basically , now you can add your own dynamic ActiveRecord methods that can potentially affect any or all of it ’s attributes .
Clean yourself up
Paul Gillard posted another useful patch , utilizing that one previously mentioned , to now provide us all with this syntactic sugar : reset_attribute !
And he even provided us with a pirate of his own to show off this new bounty :
pirate = Pirate.create !(: catchphrase => ' Yar ! ' ) pirate.catchphrase = ' Ahoy ! ' pirate.reset_catchphrase !
assert_equal " Yar ! " , pirate.catchphrase assert_equal Hash.new , pirate.changes assert !pirate.catchphrase_changed ?
Nobody likes a dirty pirate .
I ’ve just a read a fantastic New York Times article from last year on the ongoing $ 1,000,000 Netflix challenge to create an algorithm that will predict what unseen films customers will liked based on their past preferences .
As well as an interesting insight into how companies are trying to guess our shopping preferences it is also a great guide to one of the central problems in scientific psychology : how we can reconcile numerical data with human thought and behaviour .
The Netflix prize teams have a bunch of data from customers who have rated films they ’ve already seen and they have been challenged to write software that predicts future ratings .
Part of this process is hypothesis testing , essentially an experimental approach to find out what might be important in the decision process .
For example , a team might guess that women will rate musicals higher than men .
They can then test this prediction out on the data , making further predictions based on past conclusions , theories or even just hunches .
The other approach is to use mathematical techniques that look for patterns in the data .
To use the jargon , these procedures look for ‘ higher order properties ’ – in other words , patterns in the patterns of data .
Think of it like looking at the relationship between different forests rather than thinking of everything as individual trees .
The trouble is , is that these mathematical procedures can sometimes find reliable high level patterns when it is n’t obvious to us what they represent .
For example , the article discusses the use of a technique called singular value decomposition ( SVD ) to categorise movies based on their ratings ;
There ‚Äôs a sort of unsettling , alien quality to their computers ‚
Äô results .
When the teams examine the ways that singular value decomposition is slotting movies into categories , sometimes it makes sense to them ‚ Äî as when the computer highlights what appears to be some essence of nerdiness in a bunch of sci - fi movies .
But many categorizations are now so obscure that they cannot see the reasoning behind them .
Possibly the algorithms are finding connections so deep and subconscious that customers themselves wouldn ‚Äôt even recognize them .
At one point , Chabbert showed me a list of movies that his algorithm had discovered share some ineffable similarity ; it includes a historical movie , ‚ ÄúJoan of Arc , ‚Ä ù a wrestling video , ‚ÄúW.
W.E. : SummerSlam 2004 , ‚Äù the comedy ‚ Äú It Had to Be You ‚Ä ù and a version of Charles Dickens ‚ Äôs ‚ ÄúBleak House .
‚Äù
For the life of me , I can ‚Äôt figure out what possible connection they have , but Chabbert assures me that this singular value decomposition scored 4 percent higher than Cinematch ‚ Äî so it must be doing something right .
As Volinsky surmised , ‚ Äú They ‚Äôre able to tease out all of these things that we would never , ever think of ourselves .
‚Äù
The machine may be understanding something about us that we do not understand ourselves .
In these cases , it ’s tempting to think there ’s some deeply psychological property of the film that ’s been captured by the analysis .
Maybe all trigger a wistful nostalgia , or perhaps each represents the same unconscious fantasy .

It could even be that the grouping is entirely spurious and represents nothing significant .
Importantly , the answer to these questions is not in the data to be discovered , we have to make the interpretation ourselves .

( PhysOrg.com ) -- Computer scientists at Sandia National Laboratories in Livermore , Calif. , have for the first time successfully demonstrated the ability to run more than a million Linux kernels as virtual machines .
The achievement will allow cyber security researchers to more effectively observe behavior found in malicious botnets , or networks of infected machines that can operate on the scale of a million nodes .
Botnets , said Sandia ’s Ron Minnich , are often difficult to analyze since they are geographically spread all over the world .
Sandia scientists used virtual machine ( VM ) technology and the power of its Thunderbird supercomputing cluster for the demonstration .
Running a high volume of VMs on one supercomputer — at a similar scale as a botnet — would allow cyber researchers to watch how botnets work and explore ways to stop them in their tracks .
“ We can get control at a level we never had before , ” said Minnich .
Previously , Minnich said , researchers had only been able to run up to 20,000 kernels concurrently ( a “ kernel ” is the central component of most computer operating systems ) .
The more kernels that can be run at once , he said , the more effective cyber security professionals can be in combating the global botnet problem .
“ Eventually , we would like to be able to emulate the computer network of a small nation , or even one as large as the United States , in order to ‘ virtualize ’ and monitor a cyber attack , ” he said .
A related use for millions to tens of millions of operating systems , Sandia ’s researchers suggest , is to construct high - fidelity models of parts of the Internet .
“ The sheer size of the Internet makes it very difficult to understand in even a limited way , ” said Minnich .
“ Many phenomena occurring on the Internet are poorly understood , because we lack the ability to model it adequately .
By running actual operating system instances to represent nodes on the Internet , we will be able not just to simulate the functioning of the Internet at the network level , but to emulate Internet functionality . ”
A virtual machine , originally defined by researchers Gerald J. Popek and Robert P. Goldberg as “ an efficient , isolated duplicate of a real machine , ” is essentially a set of software programs running on one computer that , collectively , acts like a separate , complete unit .
“ You fire it up and it looks like a full computer , ” said Sandia ’s Don Rudish .
Within the virtual machine , one can then start up an operating system kernel , so “ at some point you have this little world inside the virtual machine that looks just like a full machine , running a full operating system , browsers and other software , but it ’s all contained within the real machine . ”
The Sandia research , two years in the making , was funded by the Department of Energy ’s Office of Science , the National Nuclear Security Administration ’s ( NNSA ) Advanced Simulation and Computing ( ASC ) program and by internal Sandia funding .
To complete the project , Sandia utilized its Albuquerque - based 4,480 - node Dell high - performance computer cluster , known as Thunderbird .
To arrive at the one million Linux kernel figure , Sandia ’s researchers ran one kernel in each of 250 VMs and coupled those with the 4,480 physical machines on Thunderbird .
Dell and IBM both made key technical contributions to the experiments , as did a team at Sandia ’s Albuquerque site that maintains Thunderbird and prepared it for the project .
The capability to run a high number of operating system instances inside of virtual machines on a high performance computing ( HPC ) cluster can also be used to model even larger HPC machines with millions to tens of millions of nodes that will be developed in the future , said Minnich .
The successful Sandia demonstration , he asserts , means that development of operating systems , configuration and management tools , and even software for scientific computation can begin now before the hardware technology to build such machines is mature .
“ Development of this software will take years , and the scientific community cannot afford to wait to begin the process until the hardware is ready , ” said Minnich .
“ Urgent problems such as modeling climate change , developing new medicines , and research into more efficient production of energy demand ever - increasing computational resources .
Furthermore , virtualization will play an increasingly important role in the deployment of large - scale systems , enabling multiple operating systems on a single platform and application - specific operating systems . ”
Sandia ’s researchers plan to take their newfound capability to the next level .
“ It has been estimated that we will need 100 million CPUs ( central processing units ) by 2018 in order to build a computer that will run at the speeds we want , ” said Minnich .
“ This approach we ’ve demonstrated is a good way to get us started on finding ways to program a machine with that many CPUs . ”
Continued research , he said , will help computer scientists to come up with ways to manage and control such vast quantities , “ so that when we have a computer with 100 million CPUs we can actually use it . ”

If you do n’t yet know what a Twitter follower is , you will soon find out .
It seems everywhere you turn today , Twitter and tweeting are the new buzz words .
Twitter , a social network that has only been around for ahile , has tremendous popularity worldwide .
Everyone seems to be excited about this up and coming way to communicate with others .
Twitter is a social network , where participants can send and receive short messages from other Twitter members .
Unlike other social networks like Facebook and My Space , Twitter is designed so that it can only be used as a SMS or a short message service .
Every message that you send is limited to 140 characters per post .
While Twitter is commonly used by individuals to stay in close contact with friends and family members , it is more and more often being used by companies and organizations as a way to market products and services .
Companies like Dell and Jet Blue use Twitter to market their services and even Barac Obama and John Edwards used Twitter as a marketing means while on the campaign trail .
Now you might be wondering how exactly does this all work ?
How do you get people to read your Twitter messages and how do you actually market yourself , products or services ?
It is really is quite simple .
It all comes down to getting twitter followers .
Twitter Followers :
Twitter followers are people who sign up to get all of your messages as you send them .
So the trick is to simply draw people to you and get them to sign up for your updates .
There are a variety of ways to get individuals interested in what you have to say .
Your main goal will be to find people who are willing to link to your profile and from there they will sign up to follow you .
Let ’s take a look at some different tips that you can use to get people to link to your profile and follow you on Twitter .
Include a link to your Twitter profile in your email signature .
This is a great way to get your information out .
If you are on other social networks or have a blog , use this as a means for advertising your Twitter profile .
Make sure you provide information and a link to your Twitter page .
Let people know you are on Twitter .
Give out your information as much as possible .
Talk about it at meetings , luncheons and any other associations you have with other people .
Add your Twitter information to your business cards and any other documents that you distribute .
Purchase a banner and advertise your Twitter profile on it .
Twitter Marketing :
As you are driving people to your Twitter profile , keep in mind that in order for them to sign up for and to continue to read your tweets you will want to be providing them with quality content that spikes their interest .
Depending on what kind of product , service or social medium you are looking to promote , there are some great ways to get the word out .
Let ’s take a look at different information that you can include in your tweets for marketing purposes .
Keep in mind that depending on what you are selling or promoting , some of these may not work for you .
Tweet to your follower ’s about upcoming sales and promotions .
Tweet to your follower ’s information on new products and services you are providing .
Provide links to your web site for such things as updated news stories , sales , promotions , customer support and anything else you deem will attract their attention .
For conferences and events you can tweet live updates and last minute changes and opportunities .
Provide quick product descriptions and customer reviews .
Overall , it is clear to see that Twitter , when used wisely , can be a very critical social medium tool in marketing your products and services .
Along with all of the above tips , it may also be useful to find the top Twitters and follow what they do .
They are always looking for new ways to attract followers and to market themselves .
If you follow their lead , you just may pick up some additional ideas .
Here are two tools which have become popular .
Each one is suited to different operations and that ’s why I ’ve included them both .
The first is a maketers dream because of its set and forget style of operation .
It ’s a system that allows you to create a lock - up style of marketing business via Twitter and is highly effective in finding targeted followers for that purpose .
When I tried this set - up , I was impressed .
Check this follower system .
The second piece of finding followers software is more for control type people ( like me ) .
I like to ensure I ’m not overdoing it and I like it easy .
Plus every month ( approx . ) they release a new tool .
They do n’t have a sleek marketing message but this software was also equally impressive and worth a visit .

Researchers from the University of Washington and the University of Florida used gene therapy to cure two squirrel monkeys of color blindness — the most common genetic disorder in people .
Writing online September 15 in the journal Nature , scientists cast a rosy light on the potential for gene therapy to treat adult vision disorders involving cone cells — the most important cells for vision in people .
" We 've added red sensitivity to cone cells in animals that are born with a condition that is exactly like human color blindness , " said William W. Hauswirth , Ph.D. , a professor of ophthalmic molecular genetics at the UF College of Medicine and a member of the UF Genetics Institute and the Powell Gene Therapy Center .
" Although color blindness is only moderately life - altering , we 've shown we can cure a cone disease in a primate , and that it can be done very safely .
That 's extremely encouraging for the development of therapies for human cone diseases that really are blinding . "
The finding is also likely to intrigue millions of people around the world who are colorblind , including about 3.5 million people in the United States , more than 13 million in India and more than 16 million in China .
The problem mostly affects men , leaving about 8 percent of Caucasian men in the United States incapable of discerning red and green hues that are important for everyday things like recognizing traffic lights .
" People who are colorblind feel that they are missing out , " said Jay Neitz , Ph.D. , a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Washington .
" If we could find a way to do this with complete safety in human eyes , as we did with monkeys , I think there would be a lot of people who would want it .
Beyond that , we hope this technology will be useful in correcting lots of different vision disorders . "
The discovery comes about 10 years after Neitz and his wife Maureen Neitz , Ph.D. , a professor of ophthalmology at the University of Washington and senior author of the study , began training two squirrel monkeys named Dalton and Sam .

In addition to teaching the animals , the Neitz research group worked with the makers of a standard vision - testing technique called the Cambridge Colour Test to perfect a way the monkeys could " tell " them which colors they were seeing .
The tests are similar to ones given to elementary children the world over , in which students are asked to identify a specific pattern of colored dots among a field of dots that vary in size , color and intensity .
The researchers devised a computer touch screen the monkeys could use to trace the color patterns .
When the animals chose correctly , they received a reward of grape juice .
Likewise , decades were spent by Hauswirth and colleagues at the University of Florida to develop the gene - transfer technique that uses a harmless adeno - associated virus to deliver corrective genes to produce a desired protein .
In this case , researchers wanted to produce a substance called long - wavelength opsin in the retinas of the monkeys .
This particular form of opsin is a colorless protein that works in the retina to make pigments that are sensitive to red and green .
" We used human DNAs , so we wo n't have to switch to human genes as we move toward clinical treatments , " said Hauswirth , who is also involved in a clinical trial with human patients to test gene therapy for the treatment of Leber congenital amaurosis , a form of blindness that strikes children .

About five weeks after the treatment , the monkeys began to acquire color vision , almost as if it occurred overnight .
" Nothing happened for the first 20 weeks , " Neitz said .
" But we knew right away when it began to work .
It was if they woke up and saw these new colors .
The treated animals unquestionably responded to colors that had been invisible to them . "
It took more than a year and a half to test the monkeys ' ability to discern 16 hues , with some of the hues varying as much as 11 - fold in intensity .
Dalton is named for John Dalton , an English chemist who realized he was colorblind and published the first paper about the condition in 1798 .
" We 've had Dalton and Sam for 10 years .
They are like our children , " Neitz said .
" This species are friendly , docile monkeys that we just love .
We think it is useful to continue to follow them — it 's been two years now that they 've been seeing in color , and continuing to check their vision and allowing them to play with the computer is part of their enrichment . "
With the discovery , the researchers are the first to address a vision disorder in primates in which all photoreceptors are intact and healthy , providing a hint of gene therapy 's full potential to restore vision .
About 1 in 30,000 Americans have a hereditary form of blindness called achromatopsia , which causes nearly complete color blindness and extremely poor central vision .
" Those patients would be targets for almost exactly the same treatment , " Hauswirth said .
Even in common types of blindness such as age - related macular degeneration and diabetic retinopathy , vision could potentially be rescued by targeting cone cells , he said .
" The major thrust of the study is you can ameliorate if not cure color blindness with gene therapy , " said Gerald H. Jacobs , Ph.D. , a research professor of psychology at the University of California , Santa Barbara , who was not involved in the research .
" There are still questions about safety , but in these monkeys at least , there were no untoward effects .
Those who are motivated to ameliorate their color defect might take some hope from the findings .
" This is also another example of how utterly plastic the visual system is to change , " Jacobs said .
" The nervous system can extract information from alterations to photopigments and make use of it almost instantaneously . "
Good news for people fearful of needles and squeamish of shots : Scientists at the 238th National Meeting of the American Chemical Society report the design of a painless patch that may someday render hypodermic needles — as well as annual flu shots — a thing of the past .
Lined with tiny " microneedles , " these patches could make treatment of diabetes and a wide range of other diseases safer , more effective and less painful .
Used as tiny hypodermic needles , they could improve treatment of macular degeneration and other diseases of the eye .
" It 's our goal to get rid of the need for hypodermic needles in many cases and replace them with a patch that can be painlessly and simply applied by a patient , " says Mark Prausnitz , Ph.D .
" If you can move to something that 's as easy to apply as a band - aid , you 've now opened the door for people to self - administer their medicine without special training . "
Prausnitz says that advances in the electronics industry in microfabricating very small objects like transistors enabled the development of microneedles .
" We 've built off those technological advances to address a need in medicine , " he explains .
" We 're trying to bring the two worlds together . "
Each needle is only a few hundred microns long , about the width of a few strands of human hair .
Prausnitz and his colleagues at the Georgia Institute of Technology suggest that the microneedle patch could , for instance , replace yearly trips to the doctor for flu shots .
" Although it would probably first be used in a clinical setting , our vision is to have a self - administered flu vaccine patch .
So instead of making an appointment with your doctor to get your flu shot , you can stop by the pharmacy or even get a patch in the mail and self - apply .
We think that could very much increase the vaccine coverage since it would be easier for people to be vaccinated , " Prausnitz explains .
In a collaboration with Emory University , Prausnitz and his team administered flu vaccines via conventional injections and microneedle patches in mice .
After exposing the mice to the flu , they compared the resulting immune response and antibody levels .
They found that the antibody levels were the same by either route .
Taking a closer look , they discovered that microneedle delivery resulted in a better protective immune response by other measures .
" Toward the goal of a flu vaccine patch , we are continuing the animal studies , but we 're also working toward our first human trial , which we hope to do in 2010 , " Prausnitz says .
Microneedles are not just able to deliver drugs through the skin — they can also be used for targeted drug delivery in the eye .
They may help create an improved treatment for macular degeneration , the leading cause of blindness in the United States .
In recent years , macular degeneration has become treatable thanks to new drugs that halt and partially reverse the disease .
The new drugs are a victory for the millions of patients suffering macular degeneration , but the treatment is not pleasant — the drugs must be injected directly into the eye every month .
" For the squeamish there are obvious drawbacks , but more importantly , there are real safety concerns about that kind of repeated injection into the eye .
With a microneedle , we can still do the same kind of concept , injecting something into the eye , but we can now do it with a very short needle that does n't penetrate all the way in , " says Prausnitz , adding that " no one else is working on microneedle - based drug delivery to the eye . "
He notes that microneedle treatments of the eye can target specific tissues in the eye .
" In localizing the delivery , microneedle treatments for macular degeneration and other diseases of the eye may prove safer than conventional needles .
We 're now doing experiments with rabbits and non-human primates — we hope to have the first human trial in the next few years , " says Prausnitz .

[ From The Socialist Tradition : Moses to Lenin ]
Fortunately , we are here concerned with only one side of Rousseau — assuming , indeed , that it is possible to detach for consideration one aspect of his legacy .
Rousseau was primarily a writer on politics , concerned , after the manner of Hobbes and of Locke , in explaining the origins of government by reference to a mythical Social Contract , the terms of which may of course be varied , according to the deductions it is desired to draw from it .
He was also a writer , and a writer of influence , on education , though he would doubtless have been a rash parent who sent his daughter to any Ladies ' College conducted by Rousseau .
He was a prophet of sentiment and sensibility .
For that matter , he had views on music .
Doubtless even in the most versatile there is a unity linking divergent activities .
In the present case , the significance of Rousseau in the development of socialist thought is to be found in the combined and pervasive influence of all his writings on succeeding generations .
Yet , within the space here available , it may be permissible , if scarcely defensible , to look on the Contrat Social as belonging rather to the history of political thought ; and , accordingly , in searching for his contribution to socialist thought , we shall confine ourselves to those writings which are more exclusively occupied with the perpetual themes of socialist discussion .
Briefly , this comes down to a consideration of his Discourse on the Origin of Inequality among Men , an essay which was not awarded the prize for a dissertation on this subject by the Academy of Dijon .
But before proceeding to the Discourse on Inequality , it may be permissible to glance at the earlier essay to which the Academy of Dijon did award its prize , thereby suddenly making Rousseau a celebrity .
The subject prescribed for this essay was , " Whether the restoration ( rétablissement ) of the Sciences and the Arts had contributed to the purification of manners ? "
There is a traditional tale that when Rousseau indicated his intention of competing for the prize , he was warned by a wise acquaintance that if he wished to have any chance of success , he would have to answer the question in the negative , since all the other candidates would be found ranged on the other side .
The authenticity of the story may be assessed by Rousseau experts .
It is probably entirely apocryphal ; but any examiner of experience will acknowledge , in his cups if not at other times , that if of fifty competing essays , forty - nine say the same thing with varying degrees of lucidity , and the fiftieth says something wholly different , this last cunning candidate has an initial advantage out of all proportion to his deserts , if only because of the difficulty the examiner has in arranging the other forty - nine in ascending order of demerit .
In any case , whether because he conscientiously so believed , or because he was instigated by Mr. Worldly Wiseman , Rousseau elected to denounce the baneful influence of the Sciences and of the Arts .
As the outlook disclosed is fundamentally the same as in the more effective , but unsuccessful , later essay , it is as well to read the two together .
Later Rousseau affected to regard his Discourse on the Sciences and the Arts as mediocre .
In substance it is ; but there is a certain bravado about this violent and monstrously one - sided attack on civilization and all its works , which doubtless made it an arresting production on its first appearance , and which obviously carried the Academicians of Dijon off their feet .
There is a considerable kinship with the later Discourse , and here already it is obvious that the theme closest to Rousseau 's heart is that of inequality and the loss of freedom .
The Sciences , Literature , and the Arts , we are told , stifle in men the sentiment of that original liberty for which they seem to have been born , and make them love their bondage .
[ 1]
The Sciences and the Arts owe their origin to our vices , and we should be in less doubt as to their advantages if they sprung from our virtues .
In explanation he argues that astronomy was born of superstition ; eloquence , of ambition ; geometry , of avarice ( a dark saying , unless he refers to the " mensuration " of our possessions ) ; physical science , of a vain curiosity ; [ 2 ] and all are the offspring of human pride .
Here we touch the fundamentals of theology , for is there not high authority for the view that Pride is not only the fundamental sin , but the only sin , of which all other sins are merely allotropic modifications ?
Moreover , this defect in the origin of the Sciences and the Arts is reflected in their aims and objects .
What would be the good of jurisprudence without the injustice of man ?
Where would history be , if there were no tyrants , wars , or conspiracies ?
In an illuminating question which goes to the root of Rousseau 's thought or prejudices in these matters , he asks , " Who would wish to pass his life in sterile contemplation , if each of us , thinking only of the duties of man and the needs of nature , had time only for the fatherland , for the unfortunate and for his friends ? " [ 3 ]
The Sciences , born in idleness , in turn nourish idleness and the vices that spring therefrom .
Rousseau , it will be observed , was not the man to allow a regard for truth to deprive him of his paradox .
But , worst of all and most specifically suggestive of the later Discourse , all these things lead to inequality .
With the development of the Sciences and the Arts , tribute is no longer paid to virtue but to ability :
We no longer ask of a man if he has integrity , but if he has talents ; nor of a book if it is useful , but if it is well written .
Rewards are showered on intellect , and virtue remains without honor .
There are thousands of prizes for les beaux discours , none for les belles actions . [ 4 ]
So far as there is an ideal here , it is that of a primitive life , so fully occupied with the claims of the fatherland , the unfortunate , and one 's friends , that there is no leisure left over in which to become vicious ; for an advance beyond this point means the development of opportunities for manifesting superiority based on intellect in place of an imaginary condition of equality in which virtue alone is held in honor .
In the Discourse on the Origin of Inequality , dating from 1754 , Rousseau gives a philosophy of history , resting on a condensed account of the development of the human race , and the whole essay is saturated with that passionate hatred of inequality which may not unfairly be regarded as the dominant feature of his character .
It is almost unnecessary to say that for Rousseau 's history there is not the faintest shadow of a particle of evidence .
Nor does Rousseau claim that there is ; he is indeed engagingly ingenuous on this point .
" Here , " he says , addressing Man at large — " here is your history as I have thought it was to be read , not in the books of your fellows , who are liars , but as it is to be found in Nature , which never lies . " [ 5 ]
Such a procedure without doubt greatly simplifies the writing of history .
In fact , Rousseau is merely imagining what it is convenient to imagine ; and , viewed in the cold light of reason , his account of the life of primitive man at times borders on the grotesque and ludicrous .
" Rousseau , it will be observed , was not the man to allow a regard for truth to deprive him of his paradox . "
The Discourse falls into two parts , of which the first is devoted to the fairy tale of Rousseau 's primitive man , and the second to the departure , with increasing acceleration , from that happy state .
As Rousseau sees him , primitive man takes his fill beneath an oak ; he quenches his thirst at the nearest stream , and he finds his bed at the foot of the tree which has given him sustenance ; and thus are all his needs satisfied .
In this condition , having regard to the rigors of the seasons ( for it cannot always be pleasant to sleep , nude , beneath a sheltering oak ) ; having regard likewise to the needs of defense or escape in the matter of beasts of prey , man is , and must be , robust and strong ; so also is his progeny .
He must use his body , his arms and his legs for everything .
When he learns to use an axe , a ladder , a sling , a horse , the convenience is bought at the price of a diminution of strength or agility .
Nor does he fear wild animals at this stage ; he is a match for them , and if need be , he can climb a tree . [ 6 ]
Apart from such dangers of the jungle , there are other ineluctable enemies — natural infirmities , infancy , and old age .
Infancy , of course , is not an infirmity peculiar to man ; but on the whole , our remote ancestors scored over other animals by reason of the greater capacity which the female of our species has in carrying about her young .
In the matter of old age , Rousseau draws a most rosy and optimistic picture of how things used to be .
In old age , the need of victuals diminished with the power of getting them — a singularly beneficent arrangement on the part of Providence ; and thus in the absence of gout and rheumatism ( unknown to la vie sauvage ) old people get snuffed out without anyone perceiving that they have ceased to exist , and almost without their noticing it themselves — " ils s'éteignent enfin , sans qu'on s'aperçoive qu'ils cessent d'être , et presque sans s'en apercevoir eux- mêmes . " [ 7 ]
One would naturally expect that their extinction would be more obvious to the survivors than to the deceased .
As for our other maladies — the rough - and - tumble of a panel practitioner 's life — Rousseau indicts society for its sins , and argues that most of our misfortunes are our own work , and that practically all could have been avoided , if we had adhered to the " simple , uniforme , et solitaire " manner of life prescribed by Nature .
As will be seen presently , it is the word solitaire that is here the most significant .
The history of human diseases is best obtained by tracing the development of civil society .
In Rousseau 's primitive paradise , no surgeon other than Time is needed to cure a fractured limb ; no treatment is necessary other than leur vie ordinaire ; and all this is accomplished without the patient being tormented with incisions , poisoned with drugs , or wasted with fastings .
If primitive man has nothing to hope but from Nature , he has on the other hand nothing to fear but his own illness .
So much for the advantages of medical benefit . [ 8 ]
Rousseau 's dissertation on the origin of language hardly concerns us , except in so far as the conditions of his problem throw light on his conception of the life of the natural and primitive man .
For the surprising view emerges , as indicated in the word solitaire already emphasized , that Rousseau 's primitive men hardly ever met .
It is Rousseau 's first difficulty in the matter of the origin of language : how could a language arise , or be regarded as necessary among men who had no communication with each other , nor any occasion to have such communication ?
For in that early phase of human society , any encounter was fortuitous and ephemeral . [ 9 ]
It is indeed fundamental to the development of Rousseau 's ultimate thesis , that Nature has taken no trouble to bring men together on the basis of their mutual needs : " sociability " is not a quality prepared by that mysterious eighteenth - century divinity called Nature .
In this primitive condition man had no need of man , and Rousseau intends to emphasize that we must , for our salvation , return to this state of affairs .
But though primitive man thus wandered about , forever solitary except for casual and transient encounters , he was not miserable ; for what kind of unhappiness could properly be attributed to a " free being , whose heart is at peace , and whose body is in health " ? [ 10 ]
" Law for Rousseau is essentially a device whereby those in possession protect themselves against the ' have - nots . ' "
It follows that in this strange world where individuals can , at most , salute each other in passing , where no moral relationships or acknowledged duties unite them , it is impossible to speak of men as being either good or bad .
In this lonely and solitary world , no question of virtue or vice can arise .
Somewhat oddly , however , and on rather insufficient grounds , Rousseau allows primitive man to have " Pity , " which is the source of all social virtues .
It is this " Pity " that in a state of nature takes the place of laws , of morals , and of virtue . [ 11 ]
Clearly also this elimination of the primitive man 's fellows delivers him from many of our present - day shortcomings .
Having no relationship with others , he knows nothing of vanity , or esteem or contempt for others .
Even the sexual instincts , in these happy days , occasioned no jealousy .
Rousseau distinguishes between that love which consists in the satisfaction of a physical need , and that love which , if it is permissible to paraphrase , results from the frills which civilization has added .
It is in this type of love alone that jealousy may arise .
The primitive man knows only the first kind of love : " toute femme est bonne pour lui , " and again , " Ie besoin satisfait , tout Ie désir est éteint . " [ 12 ]
Thus for primitive man the happy generations passed — an endless wandering in the forests , " without industry , without speech , without domicile , without war as without union , without any need of his fellows , or any desire to injure them . "
If any discoveries were made , " the art perished with the inventor " in a world where there was no education or progress , and where each succeeding generation set out from the same starting point . [ 13 ]
Rousseau 's description of the blessedness of primitive man has been summarized in some detail , because , fantastic as it may be , it is of the essence of his view of things , and it colors his later account of the fall of man from this high estate .
At this point , however , it is sufficient to draw attention again to the most astonishing feature in this most astonishing reconstruction of history .
The foundation and reason for primitive man 's happiness lies in the fact that he had no need of his fellows , in fact had no dealings with his fellows , whom , indeed , to all intents and purposes he never met .
Man was never so happy because man was never so much alone .
The second part of the Discourse is devoted to tracing the growth of inequality in place of these primitive egalitarian conditions .
It opens with a purple passage which has been so often quoted that its further quotation is almost inevitable :
The first man who , having enclosed a piece of land , took it into his head to say : " This belongs to me , " and found people simple enough to believe him , was the true founder of civil society .
What crimes , wars , murders , what miseries and horrors would have been spared the human race by him who , snatching out the stakes or filling in the ditch , should have cried to his fellows , " Beware of listening to this impostor ; you are lost if you forget that the fruits belong to all and that the earth belongs to none . " [ 14 ]
This first unrecorded enclosure was the beginning of property ; but in fact it was a culminating point rather than a point of departure .
Already , ways and means had been found to take such precautions as were necessary for safety .
There had been discoveries and inventions ; fire had been brought to earth ; the bow and the arrow , as well as hooks and snares for catching animals , had been contrived .
All this gave man a sense of superiority over other animals , and implanted in his heart " the first movement of pride . " [ 15 ]
Thus , in the triumphant and unseemly gloating of the hunter over his victim , we find the far - off roots of human inequality .
With this also came the distant foreshadowings of cooperation .
There were occasions — admittedly rare — when l'intérêt commun justified primitive man in counting on the assistance of his fellows .
How these ultra-individualistic nomads came to conceive of such a thing as the " common interest " is , however , not explained .
In such a case they united " by some sort of free association which was binding on none , and which lasted only so long as the transitory need which had occasioned it . "
Clearly , however , we have reached a stage when man is not quite so solitary as he once was : the bloom is off the peach .
For such occasional acts of mutual assistance as these , no more highly developed language than that of crows or monkeys would be necessary . [ 16 ]
In this imaginative history of the human race , the great turning point , with ramifications in many directions , came when man ceased to sleep " under the first tree , " and made some semipermanent shelter or hut , with branches and mud as their basic constituents .
For here you have the beginning of the home .
Rousseau 's primitive man had been extraordinarily successful in shaking off the casual women whom he encountered .
But now , enclosed in the same hut , are man and woman , parents and children .
Doubtless with this transition , as Rousseau acknowledges , there came the sweetest sentiments known to man , conjugal and paternal love ; but he is able to compile an alarming series of items to be entered on the debit side .
Women became sedentary , clinging to the hut , and thus there resulted a division of labor .
Also men and women alike became softer , losing something of their ferocity — although in the previous paragraphs Rousseau 's primitive man had been depicted as anything but ferocious .
Among men living in adjacent huts , language perforce had to arise .
More significant is the fact that mere propinquity gave rise to the habit of making comparisons in the matter of merit and beauty .
Jealousy awakens with love , and in the highly colored language which Rousseau loved : " Discord triumphs , and the sweetest of passions receives sacrifices of human blood . " [ 17 ]
It is an odd picture which Rousseau here draws of the rise of " distinctions " among men , imposed by their environment .
Brought together to live in adjacent cabins , what is there for these attractive primitives to do in the evenings , unless they sing and dance together under a great tree ?
Now it is a familiar fact that we do not all sing equally well or equally badly , and the same is demonstrably true in the matter of dancing .
But , given the circumstances , the man who sings best , who dances best , is most " considered . "
" Why did she fall for the leader of the band ? " is the question put by a later generation , confronted by the same phenomenon .
Es ist , apparently , eine alte Geschichte , doch bleibt sie immer neu .
In these distinctions , embodied in the judgment of spectators and critics of primitive ballroom behavior , Rousseau finds the first step towards inequality and toward vice at the same time .
One other departure from primitive perfection is significant .
From this last idea of " consideration " paid to any one excelling in any respect , arose the first ideas of civility on the one hand , and on the other the sense of outrage should the measure of respect supposed to be due happen to be withheld .
In a world where a man 's a man for a ' that , and where all are equal , there can clearly be no room for civility .
Despite these first shadows , this was the stage at which Rousseau would have had the human race remain , and he sums up in language of unmistakable clarity his astonishing philosophy of human nature :
So long as they confined themselves to works which one alone could do , and to arts which did not need the assistance of several hands , they lived free , healthy , good , and happy … but from the moment when one man had need of the assistance of another , from the moment when it was perceived that it was useful for one man to have provisions for two , equality disappeared , property was introduced , labor became necessary , and vast forests were changed into smiling fields which it was necessary to water with human sweat , and in which slavery and misery were soon seen to germinate and increase with the harvests . [ 18 ]
This indeed is the fundamental idea in this extraordinary Discourse .
Men may be equal and happy , so long as they never meet , so long as no one needs the assistance of another ; but from the moment when they cease to be solitaire , from the moment when they begin to live together , help each other , do things together , inequality enters , and from Rousseau 's point of view the rest of history is a hastening descent .
Waiving his earlier and later history as entirely fictitious , there is of course one sense in which Rousseau is merely expressing a platitude in a somewhat allegorical form .
On all this question , there is in fact of course no such thing as equality among men , for so it has been ordained by God .
Neither in stature , nor in weight , nor in chest expansion , neither in the color of the eyes or of the hair , neither in strength , intellectual capacity , or moral sensibility , are men equal .
It is perhaps possible to speak of the equality of men , if there is no possibility of comparison ; if , as in Rousseau 's primitive conditions , human beings are never brought together except for fortuitous acts of silent copulation — if , in short , the doctrine of equality is never brought to the test .
But the whole doctrine of equality in the literal sense breaks down the moment you bring men together and inevitably are forced to compare them , not merely in their capabilities for singing and dancing , as in Rousseau 's rather puerile example , but up and down the whole range of human equipment .
It is indeed only necessary to view two human beings together in order to realize that in certain respects A is " superior " to B , and in others B is " superior " to A ; but probably in no respect are they equal .
In this sense Rousseau is possibly right in suggesting that the postulated equality of men who are never brought into comparison disappears at once when they live in adjacent huts .
It is , however , to be hoped that Rousseau was trying to express more than this dowdy platitude .
Also , of course , the admitted inequality of man does not really affect that deeper question as to whether the differences in human endowment furnish grounds for existing differences in rights and rewards .
In the remainder of the Discourse , Rousseau warms to the task of denunciation as he traces the growth of inequality .
It may not , however , be necessary to follow in detail the development of the argument .
The prime impulse towards the furtherance of inequality is found by Rousseau in the arts of metallurgy and agriculture : in more concrete language it is iron and corn that have been the curse of humanity , creating groups of workers dependent on each other . [ 19 ]
Agriculture likewise led to the partition of land and consequently to laws to protect the possessor and define his rights .
Following Grotius , Rousseau recalls that when Ceres was given the title of " Lawgiver , " it was to indicate that the partition of land brought with it the necessity of a new kind of law , the law of property , as distinguished from natural law . [ 20 ]
With industry ( typified by iron ) and agriculture thus brought on the scene , the stage is set for the development of inequality .
Diversity of talent and of capacity bring their natural consequences in diversity of condition .
Vice is not far off .
It becomes necessary that men should appear to have certain qualities , even when these are absent .
" To be " and " to appear " have become entirely different matters .
Hypocrisy and deceit have arrived .
Man is no longer free and independent , since he is dependent on his fellows for the satisfaction of a multitude of needs : " Rich , he has need of their services ; poor , he has need of their assistance ; and even mediocrity does not enable him to do without them . " [ 21 ]
Add to these " devouring ambition , " and the picture begins to resemble the vision of Marx :
In a word , competition and rivalry on the one hand , and on the other conflict of interests , and always the concealed desire to make a profit at the expense of others : all these evils are the first effect of property and the inseparable accompaniment of rising inequality . [ 22 ]
The final pages of Rousseau 's essay are perhaps best viewed as examples of lurid writing rather than of lucid thinking .
He defines three main stages in the descent .
The first is the establishment of law and the right of property ; the second is the institution of the magistrature ; the third is the transformation of legitimate into arbitrary power .
In somewhat different language , these stages consecrate the distinction between rich and poor , between strong and weak , and between master and slave .
Moreover , Rousseau 's pessimism is without frontier and without boundary .
In surveying the inevitability of human descent , he observes that " the vices which render social institutions necessary are just those which render inevitable the abuse of these institutions . "
What , in short , is the good of anything ?
It is a far journey from the innocent picture of men dancing and singing on the grass , beside the primitive mud-covered huts .
It was then , when admiration was paid to one and withheld from another , that inequality was born .
Into this other Eden , another Serpent entered .
The final picture , when the curse has had time to work itself out , is one of unrelieved gloom .
Rousseau gives as bitter a picture of modern civilization as may be found anywhere , [ 23 ] and ends with the impassioned declaration that " it is manifestly contrary to the law of nature , however it may be defined , that a child should command an old man , that an imbecile should conduct a wise man , and that a handful of people should be stuffed with superfluities , while the famished multitude lack what is necessary . " [ 24 ]
Perhaps Rousseau has sufficiently testified to the faith , or the lack of faith , that is in him , so far as this is manifested in the two Discourses .
Fundamentally it is a curiously churlish philosophy that is here propounded .
Men are represented as happy so long as they live in complete isolation , having no need of each other , and no occasion to meet each other ; all evil springs from bringing them together and allowing them to cooperate .
Nor indeed is it even a consistent philosophy .
Doubtless , Rousseau is careful to explain that his savage in his solitary state has neither virtue nor vices ; but he is assuredly a noble beast , endowed with Pity , the mother of all the virtues .
Yet as soon as they are brought into contact with each other , it is of the essence of Rousseau 's explanation of the decline of man , that forthwith these noble savages seek to take advantage of each other .
$ 25 $ 19 " Property is specifically regarded as the source of all evil . "
Coming more closely to Rousseau 's place in the socialist tradition , there are perhaps three points which may be isolated and underlined for their relationship to what has gone before and to what is yet to come .
Firstly , property is specifically regarded as the source of all evil , with doubtless a certain emphasis on the case of land .
Community in all things is implied — land again receiving special emphasis — though perhaps it should be made clear that by " community " is rather meant nonappropriation .
Secondly , Law for Rousseau is essentially a device whereby those in possession protect themselves against the " have - nots " ; it is in short one of the instruments for the establishment and the maintenance of inequality .
In other words , Law ( and with it , the State ) is an instrument of the governing class .
Thirdly , in the contrast between rich and poor , the strong and the weak , masters and slaves , Rousseau preaches , and his words lend themselves to , a vitriolic class war .
But when all is said , it is perhaps truer of Rousseau than of most , that his influence can be traced less to any particular dogma or doctrine which he enunciated than to a pervasive atmosphere which emanated from Rousseau as a whole .

It was Wayne Gretzky who once described his ice hockey greatness in these terms : I skate to where the puck is going to be .
As we socialists plough yet again the seemingly dry fields , it is a message we should heed .
Our work now prepares us for the ultimate goal , a class for and of itself , ready and ripe for revolution and the conquest of political power .
As we do our steady propaganda work , and educate ourselves in the ideas of socialism and intervene as we can in the struggles around us , we are in fact preparing ourselves for that historic battle of the two main classes for power .
That does n’t mean we ignore where the ball is now .
That helps us understand where it will be in the future .
In doing that we begin to judge how best we can use the shifts in the class struggle to the advantage of our class .
Rosa Luxemburg wrote a classic and oft misunderstood piece about trade unionism in which she described trade union work as the labour of Sisyphus .
Trade unions are nothing more than the organised defence of labour power against the attacks of profit .
They express the resistance offered by the working class to the oppression of capitalist economy .
… trade unions have the function of influencing the situation in the labour - power market .
But this influence is being constantly overcome by the proletarianisation of the middle layers of our society , a process which continually brings new merchandise on the labour market .
The second function of the trade unions is to ameliorate the condition of the workers .
That is , they attempt to increase the share of the social wealth going to the working class .
This share , however , is being reduced with the fatality of a natural process , by the growth of the productivity of labour …
In other words , the objective conditions of capitalist society transform the two economic functions of the trade unions into a sort of labour of Sisyphus , which is , nevertheless , indispensable .
For , as a result of the activity of his trade unions , the worker succeeds in obtaining for himself the rate of wages due to him in accordance with the situation of the labour - power market .
As a result of trade union activity , the capitalist law of wages is applied and the effect of the depressing tendency of economic development is paralysed , or , to be more exact , is attenuated .
Sometimes it seems we party building socialists are labouring like Sisyphus .
But our activity builds our intellectual and organisational muscles and prepares us and the working class for the day when it goes on the offensive .
At the moment we are small .
There are perhaps a bit under 300 people in Australia in Socialist Alternative , the main political expression of the tendency I belong to .
But our activity and ideas regularly attract a small but growing number of people to us .
We have within us the seeds of a political party able to intervene in the class struggle and build a party capable of being the pistons to labour ’s steam .
The level of class quietude dictates that the main focus for socialists must be the campuses where the battle of ideas is at its peak during times of class peace .
But even there groups like Students for Palestine , the campaigns in support of equal love ( organised and built successfully by Socialist Alternative members along with many others ) , the defence of Indian students , the ongoing agitation against Labor and Liberal attacks on refugees , workers , government services , students and so on show a heartening attempt to put theory into practice .
This campus strategy has n’t produced a turn away from the working class as the agency of fundamental change in society and its own liberation .
In fact it reinforces it , with most students becoming workers after a few years at university , but workers now armed with an understanding of class and class politics .
Marxists can’t predict the future , but it seems likely that at some stage class struggle in Australia will return , perhaps even explode , despite the deadening influence of the Labor Party and the Australian Council of Trade Unions .
The more people who are prepared practically and theoretically for that day the closer we will be to a truly democratic society where production is organised to satisfy human need .
Then begins our liberation .
Join us in running to where the ball will be .
Sometimes I get my best insights from people I do n’t agree with .
For instance , I ’ve always found the anarcho - primitivist writer John Zerzan fascinating , even though I disagree with nearly 100 % of what he writes .
For those in the dark about primitivism , it rejects not only modern industrial capitalism , but all technology and division of labor in even the most basic form , in an attempt to recover a primal wildness and harmony with nature without such mediating systems as language and culture .
I had been reading up on anarcho - syndicalism when I came across this short essay by Zerzan on “ The Bourgeois Roots of Anarcho - Syndicalism “ .
He writes :
The values upheld by anarcho - syndicalists do not significantly differ from those of the more radical of the bourgeois liberal theorists , and their project , upon examination , proves to be merely the extension of the liberal project .
Like the bourgeoisie – and maybe even more than the bourgeoisie – the anarcho - syndicalists embrace the values essential to capitalism .
What are these values .
First of all , technological and economic progress , obviously a no - no for primitivists as it constitutes man ’s continuing “ mastery ” and “ domination ” over nature .
And the values which support this end include the work ethic , conformity , “ social peace ” , and “ a rational , ethical society ” .
Both bourgeois liberal theorists and anarcho - syndicalists want a rational , ethical society based on freedom , equality and justice , guaranteeing human rights .
Both want a smoothly running economy with high levels of production guaranteeing scientific and technological progress .
Both require social peace and conformity to realize their projects .
It is difficult not to think that their projects are the same .
I see only two significant differences .
The bourgeoisie sees the economy as an apolitical force that can progress efficiently and ethically in the form of private enterprise .
The anarcho - syndicalists recognize the economy as a political force which must , therefor , be run democratically .
The bourgeois liberals believe that representational democracy can create their ideal .
Anarcho - syndicalists believe that democracy must be direct – though they never seem to ask us if we want to spend time directly voting on every social issue that comes up .
The project of the anarcho - syndicalists is really just an extension of the project of the project of bourgeois liberalism – an attempt to push that project toward its logical conclusion .
On the values Zerzan lists , I find that some ( peace and rationality ) are entirely good while others ( conformity and work ) rather mixed blessings .
None can have any value for the primitivist .
Zerzan ’s critique leads me to two conclusions .
The first is that the disparate economic ideas of anarchists are n’t entirely incommensurable .
As Mises wrote in Human Action :
What divides those parties one calls today world view parties , i.e. , parties committed to basic philosophical decisions about ultimate ends , is only seeming disagreement with regard to ultimate ends .
Their antagonisms refer either to religious creeds or to problems of international relations or to the problem of the ownership of the means of production or to problems of political organization .
It can be shown that all these controversies concern means and not ultimate ends .
. . . for all parties committed to pursuit of the people ’s earthly welfare and thus approving social cooperation , questions of social organization and the conduct of social action are not problems of ultimate principles and of world views , but are ideological issues .
They are technical problems with regard to which some arrangement is always possible .
Note that Mises distinguishes between “ world views ” , which interpret all phenomena , including physics , metaphysics , ethics , and so on , and narrower “ ideologies ” , which “ have in view only human action and social cooperation ” .
Anarcho - syndicalism and liberalism , according to Zerzan , share a bourgeois world view while differing in ideology .
Primitivism , on the other hand , is another world view entirely ( actually , according to Mises ’ full definition , it might even fail at that ) .
The world view shared by liberalism and anarchism , as well as most schools of socialism , has a name never mentioned by Zerzan : Enlightenment .
This is my second conclusion :
If syndicalism as Zerzan describes it is the logical conclusion of bourgeois liberalism , i.e. the Enlightenment , then primitivism is the logical conclusion of the reaction against the Enlightenment , i.e. Romanticism or Counter - Enlightenment .
This is a strain of thought which is an undercurrent in socialism as well as many varieties of conservative and right - wing thought .
It ’s most famous figure is Rousseau , but also includes such tempestuous reactionaries as Johann Georg Hamann , Johann Gottfried Herder , William Blake , the writers associated with the Frankfurt School , and postmodernists too numerous to mention .
I am not completely opposed to Romanticism .
Indeed , I love romantic art and find many Romantic critiques of reason and modernity to have some validity .
But reading the primitivists such as Zerzan ( and even more ridiculous figures like Hakim Bey ) as they reject culture and scoff at the notions of “ social peace ” and “ ethical society ” even as they praise such people as Ted Kaczynski , is enough to give one pause , to say the least .
I think an excellent book could be written on this subject , interpreting modern political history not in terms of Left vs. Right , or Capitalism vs. Socialism , but Enlightenment vs. Romanticism , and tracing the threads of counter - enlightenment though on the left and right .
For a critique of primitivism and related subcultural movements from a perspective that is anarchist , anti-capitalist , and environmentalist , see Murray Bookchin ’s classic essay Social Anarchism or Lifestyle Anarchism : An Unbridgeable Chasm .
His essay means to implicate liberal individualism along with what he calls “ lifestyle anarchism ” , but I think fails , for the main reason that the first is an Enlightenment individualism stressing social harmony , and the latter a Romantic individualism stressing rebellion for its own sake .
But that ’s a subject for another time .
You ’ll find Network Utility in the Utilities folder inside the Applications folder .
It comes free with every Mac , and it 's great for figuring out what the problem is with a dodgy internet connection .
Everything you can do in Network Utility you can actually do in a Terminal window using unix tools .
But why go to all that effort when Apple have created a nice application that lets you do things much more easily .
When you first open up Network Utility you will see nine tabs along the top [ Update : eight in Snow Leopard ] .
Here 's a run through of what you can do in each tab .
1. Info
The first tab , Info , unsurprisingly gives you general information about your network .
The Network Interface drop - down menu shows all the different ways your Mac can connect to the Network .
Typically these are ethernet , wireless and Firewire .
The useful bits of information are the Hardware Address and IP Address .
You will only have an IP address if that network interface is connected , otherwise it will say unknown .
The Hardware Address , otherwise known as a MAC address , can be used to uniquely identify your computer ( even though it is possible to change it ) .
One useful way to use the MAC address is when setting up your wireless router .
You can set most routers to only allow specific MAC addresses to join , meaning other people can't log onto your wireless and connect to the internet .
2. Netstat
Netstat is a tool that is really useful to network administrators for troubleshooting , but pretty useless to the average user .
If you choose " Display routing table information " and click Netstat , you will get a list that contains all the computers on the network .
For example , I get Matts - Macbook , Matts - iPhone and ChrisG5 .
If you choose " Display the state of all current socket connections " and click Netstat you 'll see a list of your computer 's network connections .
For example , the first items on the list will correspond to any web pages you have open .
If you type the numbers under " Foreign Address " into Safari , the web page will sometimes appear .
3. AppleTalk
The AppleTalk tab is very similar to the Netstat tab , but specifically for Apple 's proprietary protocol called AppleTalk .
It was very popular in the early days of the Mac , but now has been pretty much abandoned and is unsupported in Snow Leopard .
You can read more about AppleTalk on its Wikipedia page .
[ Update : The AppleTalk tab is completely gone in Snow Leopard ]
4. Ping
Ping is a tool to check if an internet address is working .
When you " ping " an address , you send a small bit of data which it sends back .
You can use this to check if a website is down if it is n't loading in Safari .
Alternatively , if you think your internet connection is down , you can try pinging sites that almost never go down like google.com and bbc.co.uk to see if you have a problem on your end .
5. Lookup
Lookup allows you to get information about a web site or IP address .
The drop - down menu allows you to choose from a number of different types of information .
For example , performing a Name Server lookup on macosxtips .
co.uk will tell you that this site is hosted by Dreamhost , and a MX record lookup will tell you that our email is handled by Google .
6. Traceroute
When you enter an address and click Trace , traceroute will show you the route taken by data sent between you and the server .
It allows you to see all the servers that your data goes through along the way .
You can use this to troubleshoot connection problems by finding out the point where your data is being blocked .
You can also use it when you are downloading a file and have multiple download mirrors in different locations to choose from .
Just type the addresses of the mirrors into traceroute and you can get a good idea of which mirror is fastest .
7. Whois
The Whois database gives you information about internet addresses and who has registered them .
The default whois server whois .
internic.net works quite well for most addresses , but you might have to type " domain apple.com " for example to get it to work .
For .co.uk addresses use " whois.nic.uk " as the whois server .
You will get information like the registrant , their address , who they registered with , when their registration was started and and when it expires .
8. Finger
Finger , created in 1971 , is one of the earliest forms of status updates that are now done using Facebook and Twitter .
It 's hardly used anymore , but you can use finger to check if your friends are online , and you can post . plan files to your profile similar to blog posts .
One of the best ways to use finger is to type in your username or the username of another user on your Mac .
It will tell you if they / you are currently logged in and how long since they / you last logged in .
9. Port Scan
The final tab in Network Utility , Port Scan , is for scanning which ports are open at a certain address .
These Network ports are a sort of virtual version of the ports on the side of your computer , and each port is for a certain type of network traffic .
For example , port 80 is used for web pages .
You can use Port Scan to test your own computer by typing in the name of your Mac followed by " .local " .
You can find this name in the Sharing section of System Preferences .
Things like iTunes sharing , instant messaging , BitTorrent , AFP and SMB sharing all use different ports .
If you find that one of these is n't working , it might be because your firewall is blocking the port that it uses .
Instead of turning off your firewall , you can just set it to open that port .
Just run Port Scan with the application or sharing turned off and then again with it turn on to see which port appears .
You can then set your firewall to open this port and allow network traffic through .
Note that the built in firewall that comes with Mac OS X works on a per application basis rather than a port basis , to keep things simpler for the average user .
If eighteen - year - old Milan Karki does n't turn out to be the next Tesla or Edison , then I 'll chop off my locks .
This kid invented a solar panel which uses human hair as a conductor and could solve an energy crisis .

As a teenager in a rural village in Nepal , Milan Karki knows just how desperately developing countries need an affordable , renewable energy source .
But rather than whine about the availability of electricity or the cost of batteries , he sat down and came up with a solution : Low - cost solar panels with human hair conductors .
Advertisement
Solar energy is n't anything new , but solar panels themselves can be pricey to produce due to using silicon .
Karki solved the cost issue by using human hair instead since it turns out that Melanin , a color pigment in hair , is a good conductor .
Oh , and did we mention that it 's cheaper than silicon ?
Half a kilo of hair can be bought for only 16 p in Nepal and lasts a few months , whereas a pack of batteries would cost 50 p and last a few nights .

I do n't know why they 're selling hair by the kilo , but this idea is absolutely brilliant and I can't wait to see if it turns into something widely used .

Is spending money included ?
“ FAILURE is the condiment that gives success its flavour , ” observed Truman Capote .
It can also be something to celebrate in its own right , even in winning - obsessed America .
Just think of the film industry 's Golden Raspberries ( Razzies ) or the Darwin Awards , which honour the most ridiculous accidental deaths .
Now would seem a good time for finance to fete its own flops , too .
Enter Hedgeable.com , an investment start - up that has come up with a neat gimmick to draw attention to its launch : a nationwide contest to find the three investors whose portfolios lost the most value between October 2007 , when stockmarkets began to tumble , and March 2009 , when they hit bottom .
The financial world 's equivalent of Paris Hilton — named as worst actress , worst supporting actress and half of the worst screen couple in this year 's Razzies — will be revealed on October 7th .
The consolation will be a holiday in Rome , “ the last great empire to collapse under a mountain of debt , a devalued currency and out - of - control spending , ” as Hedgeable 's website has it , and an appearance on CNBC , a financial - news network .
The prizes for second and third place are trips to Iceland , scene of a more recent collapse , and Las Vegas , America 's foreclosure capital .
“ We 're trying to make light of a bad situation , but we hope the winners find the travel educational , ” says Michael Kane , Hedgeable 's boss .
The firm expects the worst portfolios to be stuffed with bank shares and ultra-long exchange - traded funds ( which fall by several points when the industry index falls by one ) and to have fallen by as much as 95 % over the period .
It will check with entrants ' brokers to make sure they have not artificially inflated their losses .
Who knows what lengths the desperate will go to for a junket ?
Though aimed at small fry , plenty of sophisticated investors would be in with a chance .
It remains to be seen if the thought of a few days in Reykjavik is enough to tempt the partners of TPG , a private - equity firm that lost its shirt on Washington Mutual , a mortgage bank , or Joe Lewis , a British billionaire who put $ 1.2 billion into Bear Stearns at an average price of $ 107 per share just months before the investment bank was sold to JPMorgan Chase for less than a tenth of that .
A DIPLOMATIC row between Australia and China over the planned visit of exiled Uighur leader Rebiya Kadeer has escalated , with Australias ambassador called to a dressing - down by Chinas Foreign Ministry .
As Chinese hackers again attacked the website of the Melbourne International Film Festival , which Ms Kadeer is scheduled to attend this week , ambassador Geoff Raby was told of Chinas strong dissatisfaction and opposition to the visit .

Vice - Foreign Minister Zhang Zhijun told Mr Raby that Australia must immediately correct its wrongdoings and cancel Ms Kadeers visa , the Xinhua news agency reported .
The demand came as the second cyber - attack in a week shut down online ticket sales for the festival , causing chaos as patrons were forced to queue outside venues to pick up tickets booked over the phone .
When the general public is asked to describe the consequences of brain injury , the most frequent responses will involve some concept of the victim ’s loss of consciousness .
This is unfortunate since , as those of us that deal with the long - term consequences are all too aware , the real “ battle ” does n’t begin until after consciousness returns .
For the purpose of this general overview , we may define any change from a state of full self - awareness to a state of decreased ( or absent ) self - awareness as a disorder of consciousness .
In the medical literature , recovery from a disorder of consciousness is defined as occurring along a continuum ; which is to say that such recovery progresses in a direct , linear , and predictable fashion .
The rapidity and completeness of recovery , of course , varies between individuals and with the underlying disease process that is the cause of such disorders .
None the less , it will be helpful to review the general stages that may or may not be encountered .
The first , and by far the most serious , stage in the disorders of consciousness is that of coma ; a state of profound ( deep ) unconsciousness in which the victim is unable to move , open his / her eyes , or respond appropriately in any way to external stimulation .
Those in a coma are unable to breathe on their own and depend on mechanical support of respiratory activity , as well as intensive medical and nursing care , in order to survive .
Coma as a distinct clinical condition is very rarely a persistent condition , meaning that those surviving the initial event which induced coma will either progress to a less severe level of neurological compromise or will die .
Despite the occasional “ sensational ” or “ anecdotal ” reports in the news media , there has never been a documented case of spontaneous recovery from coma directly to “ consciousness .
Such “ miracle ” recoveries have always been from a less severe level of impaired consciousness and have further been complicated by marked loss of motor skills such as speaking , use of table utensils , or the ability to perform simple self - care functions .
The next stage in the continuum is the vegetative state ( VS ) , which is defined as a state in which the patient may be able to breathe without assistance yet remains dependent on skilled medical and nursing care in order to survive .
Those in the vegetative state may open their eyes and may even make occasional non-purposeful sounds such as grunting or laughter but they are incapable of making intentional responses to external events .
In the vegetative state , the patient has an established sleep / wake cycle , which can give the illusion of conscious activity .
The vegetative state , unlike coma , may persist for years upon years without obvious improvement in the victim ’s clinical condition
The final stage , and the stage that is currently the focus of intense clinical research ( Owen , 2006 ; Schiff , 2007 ) , is the minimally conscious state ( MCS ) .
In this state the victim demonstrates
“ … limited and intermittent capacity for conscious behavior .
These patients occasionally demonstrate clear - cut signs of self - or environmental awareness … the diagnosis of MCS is based on the presence of specific behavioral manifestations of conscious awareness .
These behaviors occur inconsistently , must be differentiated reliably from reflexive , random , and spontaneous behavior , and include functions such as simple command following , production of yes / no responses , intelligible verbalization , and contingent behavioral responses … ( Hirsch , 2005 ) . ”
As with the vegetative state , the minimally conscious state may also persist for years .
But , in contrast to the vegetative state , the victim may continue to demonstrate a slow overall improvement .
Once again , changes are impossible to predict .

WILMINGTON TO CHICAGO
I 'm driving out to Chicago on 9/1 around noon .
I 'm looking for someone to split the cost of gas / tolls .
If interested , send me an email .
From Me to ***********@*********.org
Hi !
I am trying to go to Chicago , and the 1st sounds good to me .
I took my ex-girlfriend 's EZ - pass out of her car when she was n't looking , so we can use that to pay for tolls .
I have a few things I want to bring , do you have a lot of room ?
Mike
From Brian ****** to Me :
Hi Mike ,
Will the easy pass still work even though it is n't in your ex's car ?
I do have some room , what are you trying to bring ?
From Me to Brian ******:
Brian ,
I just want to bring a few duffel bags of clothes .
Also , yes , the EZ pass will still work .
Mike
From Brian ****** to Me :
That should n't be a problem .
By the way , how old are you ?
Can you tell me a bit about yourself ?
From Me to Brian ******:
I am 25 , and I am a landscaper .
I actually am going to Chicago for a national landscaper convention .
I just remembered , I also need to bring my weedwhacker .
Will that fit in your car ?
Mike
From Brian ****** to Me :
It should ... I have a Honda Civic but it has a trunk access panel and we might be able to lay it across the back seat / trunk .
From Me to Brian ******:
Great !
I also have a mini - fridge that I want to bring ( my hotel does n't have one , and I need to keep my vodka chilled ) .
Can we squeeze this in as well ?
Mike
From Brian ****** to Me :
How big is it .
I need room for my things too .
From Me to Brian ******:
It is about half the size of a normal fridge .
I have some duct tape and rope , we could strap it to the roof of your car .
From Brian ****** to Me :
I do n't want to do that sorry .
How about you bring it and we can see if it will fit .
From Me to Brian ******:
Sounds good !
I 'm sure it will fit .
I also want to bring my TV ... it is a 50 " flat screen .
Is that a problem ?
I really hate the small TVs they have at the hotel .
From Brian ****** to Me :
How much shit are you bringing dude ?
Are you trying to move to Chicago ?
I said I have a Civic ... not a moving van .
From Me to Brian ******:
I 'm not bringing that much stuff , just my clothes , weedwhacker , mini- fridge , and TV .
You said you had room for my stuff ... now you do n't ?
I do n't understand .
Does this mean we can't take my recliner either ?
From Brian ****** to Me :
Are you for real ?
From Me to Brian ******:
Yes I am for real .
I just had an idea ... Does your Civic have a hitch ?
I want to bring my Ford F250 truck , could we hook it to your car ?
It would be nice for me to have my truck in Chicago so I do n't have to ride in those dirty cabs everywhere .
We could put some of the stuff I want to bring in the bed of my truck , since you " suddenly " do n't have that much room .
From Brian ****** to Me :
Why do n't you just drive your goddamn truck there .
This is crazy
From Me to Brian ******:
Do n't get me wrong , I love my truck , but it is n't so good on gas mileage .
Ca n't we just tow it there ?
It works out better this way , because I wanted to bring my four wheeler but was afraid to ask you because you seem to be getting all pissy about me bringing my stuff .
From Brian ****** to Me :
Why the hell do you need all this shit for a trip to chicago .
If anything it is your truck that should be towing my Civic .
For christ 's sake man , get real .
From Me to Brian ******:
Oh , do you think your Civic is n't capable of towing my truck ?
I understand .
Tell you what , I 'll talk to my friend Anthony .
He 's a mechanic , and could put a better motor in your car so it has more power to tow my truck .
It should n't cost that much .
What is your number ?
I 'll tell him to give you a call .
From Brian ****** to Me :
I 'm done talking to you .
From Me to Brian ******:
So am I still getting the ride ?
I talked to Anthony and he actually needs a ride to Chicago too .
I told him he could come if he helps pay for gas .
Do you have an extra seat for him ?
He might have some stuff he wants to bring .

As I alluded to in this post on Tuesday , I participated in a conference call between the Canadian membership of Democrats Abroad and Ohio Rep. Dennis Kucinich on the topic of health care reform .
The reason for my participation is simple .
I am an American citizen working for an American corporation but living in Vancouver , British Columbia , Canada .
When I was offered the opportunity to relocate from Pittsburgh , Pennsylvania to Vancouver , British Columbia I did as any other person would do , I consulted my wife and together we listed out all of the pro’s , con ’s , opportunities and risks surrounding this potential move .
Uprooting a young family is not something that should be taken lightly no matter how lucrative the opportunity may seem .
In the end , one of the items that helped tip the scales in favor of relocation was Canada ’s single payer health care system .
Now , I can already hear the angry mobs amassing at the comment section ready to shout their uninformed drivel about how awful the Canadian health care system is , how people are dying in the street waiting for services , and how such a horrific socialist system would never work in the U.S .
To that let me just say one thing .
Bullshit .
It has been nearly two years since I took my family to Canada and so far our experience with the health care system is quite the opposite .
But that is not why I am writing today so rather than spend too much time here talking about it I promise another post ( or series ) on the topic at a later date .
Back to the topic at hand .
So Tuesday I participated in this con call with Rep. Kucinich fully expecting to be on the receiving end of another one of those political action speeches where the politician shows up and rally ’s the troops to whatever end he / she has in mind .
Instead , I was greeted by an open line conference call where all participants introduced themselves and each had an opportunity to ask a question of the Representative .
Refreshing to say the least .
My question was simple , after having watched both House Oversight Committee hearings on health care reform lead by the congressman I asked him this :
“ During the hearings you stated that your bill ( HR676 ) was likely DOA .
Can you explain why ?
What is preventing our representatives from actually acting in the interest of their constituency . ”
His answer was not at all what I expected .
He lead by defending his effort .
“ First let me point out that hr676 has 70 co-sponsors in the house of representatives ” which I agree nothing to sneeze at .
But then came the message that Kucinich had decided he wanted to carry to this group of American expats ,
“ In 2000 I tried to bring a bill and was asked by the head of the Gore campaign not to bring it because of the funding they were receiving [ from the health care industry ] .
In 2008 I was excluded from debates that were sponsored by health insurance companies .
It is a huge business and they are determined not to let go of it .
They use their influence to buy their way through .
Even a weak public option is not going to get through this congress . ”
And he did not end with that .
In answer after answer to each question posed by the group he hammered home two distinct messages .
1 ) In this congress the public option is dead and 2 ) a public option will eventually prevail but it will be a decade long struggle .
When questioned about whether the blue - dog Democrats were in effect siding with the Republicans and / or the health care industry Kucinich said ,
“ It ’s my opinion that the blue dogs are doing exactly what the white house wants them to do .
The public option was a trial balloon .
I can not stress how cynical and brutal the politics are .
This is not about the public option .
Anyone looking for the public option needs to look someplace else .
It is not going to happen and anybody who says it is is in fantasy land . ”
When asked about what can be done for American health care reform Kucinich took the position of man with a deeper understanding of the true struggle ,
“ We have to take a long term perspective on this .
8 - 10 years down the road .
This is a civil rights movement we have here .
I think we are going to have single payer in the states one day .
Unfortunately there are going to be many people who get sick , go broke and die before we get there . ”
What Kucinich was doing was resetting expectations and delivering a hard message to the majority of Americans that support a public option today .
He was saying do not expect a public option any time soon .
Whatever might get through this congress masquerading as a public option will not be worth much .
And if a public option is ever to pass on a national level it will likely come only after a groundswell of grassroots effort .
Reset your clocks for a long term fight .
Work with local organizations such as the one being lead by Chuck Pennacchio in Pennsylvania with HealthCare4AllPA .

Q. Does the new ownership of the team change anything for you for the future ?
Robert Kubica :
Well , yes and no .
It 's very good that BMW and Sauber got a solution with the new owner and the investors .
But on the other hand the team is not on the grid for now , so it 's a bit of a strange situation , because there 's everything to do a good job with this team next year , but there 's no place for now , so it 's a bit difficult .
Q . Have the events at Renault make you think twice before going there ?
RK : Of course somehow I was a bit more interesting about the FIA outcome than normally , because Renault is one of the possible options for me for the future and for sure it 's good that they are staying .
Of course losing two key people will change the situation a bit , but I do n't know , we 'll see .
Q . When do you expect to make a decision about what you will do ?
RK : I think sooner or later , but I do n't have a set time , so we 'll take out time and then see .
Q. Is Renault still a possibility for you ?
RK : As I said Renault is one of the options , of course .
There are other teams where there 's an opportunity to race in the future so we will see .
Q . When you say things have changed with two key people having left ..
RK :
It might have changed , there has to be change .
I assume that when you lose such important people there has to be some change , and for sure there will be some changes , I assume .
Q. How easy would have been to make the wrong decision with all the confusion ?
How big is the risk ?
RK : There 's always a risk , and there 's never a guarantee that you are going to go in a better direction .
You cannot predict the performance of the car for next year , but still , you know , you have internal feelings which lead you to make a decision .
But there are things outside of performance because this cannot know .
Q. Is it important then to have flexibility in your future plans ?
RK : I do n't think so .
I have been with BMW Sauber for a long time and for sure if they were n't leaving F1 I would stay here .
I 'm looking forward to a new challenge and also to a longer relationship , because even if you are not on top straight away , if you have everything to bring you to the top you can be there with time .
So for sure I would rather look for longer term options .
Q. Have you ruled out staying in this team ?
RK : No .
Sauber is one of the options .
The money is there , so there 's everything needed to be on a high level .
But on the other hand it 's kind of a question mark , because if I decide to be here and then in January I discover we will not be on the grid is a bit difficult .
Q . How much easier would it be if you knew the team will be on the grid ?
RK :
It would be completely different for me , for the team and for everybody .
I think also for the team is not easy to find sponsors and everything , I assume .
Q . Do you think the Renault scandal has had an effect in Formula 1 ?
RK : Well , for sure it did have an effect , because in the end such a big thing ...
It had an effect in the fans , on the people , and maybe those who do n't follow Formula 1 , but it 's the kind of thing that grabs your attention .
When you switch on the TV and the radio there was a lot of information on this case .
For sure it had an effect .
This year we 've had a lot of thing which were not related to the sport , which was no good for the racing and for the drivers , but this is how it is .
For someone F1 is a sport , for someone F1 is a business , so this is how it is .
Q. Does it make you think about the integrity of F1 and as ' what am I involved in ' ?
RK : Somehow if you want to race in F1 you have to accept that sometimes it's a bit drifting from the ideal view of Formula 1 , but that 's how it is .
Once you are in , as a driver what 's most important is to be racing .
All in all , for me it 's 100 per cent sport , because I 'm a racing driver .
I 'm jumping into the car and I 'm racing against the others .
For me it 's a 100 per cent racing and 100 per cent sport .
Q . You were one of the victims of the safety car last year .
RK : I would have probably finished on the podium .
Q. Winning ?
RK : No , I do n't think so .
Q. Did it affect your championship ?
RK : Now when we look we can say yes , but at that point the circumstances were very strange , but no one really thought maybe some people faulted .
It 's last year and the only thing I 'm surprised about is that someone from the FIA knew already last year , so I was surprised they did n't do something last year if they had the information .
I think it 's a too complicated topic .
Q. What are the chances of Nelson Piquet returning to Formula 1 ?
RK : I do n't know .
Q. Would you welcome him back ?
RK : Him ?
Whatever , I 'm not the boss of this paddock so he can come in , no problem as a driver .
But you have to be really desperate to do something like this .
If everything was done on purpose I would jump out of the car on the starting grid .
I 'd say I 'm not racing or I feel bad instead of doing it .
I 'm surprised .
He 's an experienced driver , he 's done a lot of races and I 'm very surprised he made that deal .
Q . Do you think giving him immunity sends the wrong message ?
RK : Yeah , normally if you go the police and you say you killed someone but you know someone else who killed three people , you will still go to jail .
Maybe you will not have 100 per cent penalty , but you will still have problems .
As I said , it 's complex .
Q . What do you think about the new kerbs here ?
RK : I think the pit exit is much better , much safer .
The pit entry was already tricky last year and this year I think is even more tricky .
Now it 's much slower and the outside kerb is quite high , so if you get it wrong you might be launched onto the track and if someone is coming it might be very dangerous .
Already last year was quite risky .
This year it looks much more risky if someone gets it wrong .
Q. And the chicane ?
RK :
The chicane already last year was very strange .
It was kind of not an F1 corner .
This year it 's much tighter and the kerbs and also higher .
It 's a very difficult corner , because if you risk a lot you can gain a lot of time , but also you can finish on the wall .
# 1. Popeye – Spinach My Ass .
Whatever was in that can was laced with some kind of HGH .

He pulled out his Super Syringe and bulked up quick .
Kryptonite was just an excuse not to get tested .

This picture shows Batman really needing a hit .
Robin was really a dealer who kept all of the injections and pills in order for Batman .

This is also the perfect example of what happens when you juice but do n’t work out enough .

Flintstone was another example of how not working out defeats the purpose .
He also tried to juice little kids in his Flintstones Chewable Vitamins .
What do you think was really in those ?

Obvious skin discoloration and facial sagging .
He is the best example as far as mood swings as a side - effect of abusing steroids .

Helen Fawkes reports .
I just released version 0.3.3 of the Haskell statistics library , which contains a very fast pseudo - random number generator .
The generator is an implementation of George Marsaglia ’s MWC256 multiply - with - carry PRNG , which has a period of 2 8222 ( for this reason , it ’s sometimes referred to as MWC8222 ) .
It produces high - quality uniformly distributed pseudo - random numbers extremely quickly .
Here is a brief performance comparison between the statistics library , the mersenne - random library , the normal Haskell PRNG , and a C implementation of MWC256 .
The numbers represent millions of variates generated and summed per second , so higher is better .
( Measured on a 64 - bit Core2 Duo laptop running Fedora 11 . )
Package Int64 Double Word32 System .
Random 0.7 1.6 n/ a mersenne - random 101.2 53.8 96.3 statistics 145.7 116.5 251.6 C ( normal ) 131.0 103.2 292.9 C ( inlined ) 162.0 118.7 375.6 C ( inlined , unrolled ) 186.5 171.7 571.2
As the numbers indicate , the MWC256 implementation in the statistics library is up to 3 times faster than the mersenne - random library , and often faster than the C code you ’d expect to encounter in practice .
And you should n’t use the standard Haskell PRNG if you care about performance .
( The last two rows in the table above indicate what you could expect from an aggressive C compiler that performed cross - module inlining and loop unrolling , such as almost works reliably in gcc these days .
If you were using normal compilation flags and source file structure , you would be unlikely to see those kinds of numbers in practice . )
A nice feature of the PRNG in the statistics library is that it has a cleaner interface than mersenne - random .
Due to the cheesy implementation of the underlying C code , the mersenne - random library enforces the use of a single PRNG for the entire program , which makes it onerous to work with .
You have to create a single generator when your program starts , and pass it everywhere that you might eventually need random numbers .
In a multi - threaded program , only one thread at a time can use the PRNG .
The PRNG in the statistics library runs inside the ST monad , so you can generate random variates from inside pure Haskell code .
You can create or use a generator anywhere without worrying about threading issues , and there ’s a handy function provided that lets you seed a generator from your system ’s random number source .
As a final tweak , the new PRNG generates floating point numbers in the range ( 0,1 ] , so the variates it generates are safe for using in statistical computations that are zero- phobic , such as those involving logarithms or division .
I ’ve also included a generator for normally - distributed floating point numbers that uses Doornik ’s modified ziggurat algorithm , so it ’s both fast and trustworthy .

Permeating the region is a diffuse haze of X - ray light from gas that has been heated to millions of degrees by winds from massive young stars - which appear to form more frequently here than elsewhere in the Galaxy - explosions of dying stars , and outflows powered by the supermassive black hole - known as Sagittarius A* ( Sgr A* ) .
Data from Chandra and other X - ray telescopes suggest that giant X - ray flares from this black hole occurred about 50 and about 300 years earlier .
The area around Sgr A * also contains several mysterious X - ray filaments .
Some of these likely represent huge magnetic structures interacting with streams of very energetic electrons produced by rapidly spinning neutron stars or perhaps by a gigantic analog of a solar flare .
Scattered throughout the region are thousands of point - like X - ray sources .
These are produced by normal stars feeding material onto the compact , dense remains of stars that have reached the end of their evolutionary trail - white dwarfs , neutron stars and black holes .
Because X - rays penetrate the gas and dust that blocks optical light coming from the center of the galaxy , Chandra is a powerful tool for studying the Galactic Center .
This image combines low energy X - rays ( colored red ) , intermediate energy X - rays ( green ) and high energy X - rays ( blue ) .
The image is being released at the beginning of the " Chandra 's First Decade of Discovery " symposium being held in Boston , Mass .
This four - day conference will celebrate the great science Chandra has uncovered in its first ten years of operations .
To help commemorate this event , several of the astronauts who were onboard the Space Shuttle Columbia - including Commander Eileen Collins - that launched Chandra on July 23 , 1999 , will be in attendance .
( PhysOrg.com ) -- " Le Petit Prince " is a cute one - eyed robot greenhouse designed for use on Mars , and is among the top eight finalists announced last week in the 2009 Electrolux Design Lab competition .
The finalists were selected from over 900 entries .
Le Petit Prince ( The Little Prince — after the 1943 story by Antoine de Saint Exupery ) is a futuristic device that takes care of a single plant and seeks out the best place for it to thrive .
It is designed for use during exploration and human colonization of Mars , and consists of a four - legged pod with a glass greenhouse fixed on top .
Inside the greenhouse is a single plant growing in hydroponic solution .
The robot can move around with the help of a camera eye , and its sensors detect heat , light , water , and nutrients , to help it determine the optimal location for its single plant to grow .
The robot also communicates with the other robots through wireless technology , to enable them to effectively swap notes and teach each other .
In an interview with Electrolux , the designer of the greenhouse robot , Martin Miklica , a student at the Brno University of Technology in the Czech Republic , said he drew inspiration from many sources , but especially The Naked Sun by Isaac Asimov , and R2 - D2 from the Star Wars movies .
The theme of the Electrolux Lab competition this year is " Designs for the next 90 years " .
Miklica believes his design is relevant to the theme because over the next four generations , we will have many dreams , but one constant dream is reaching the stars .
Mars will be a stepping stone to see if we can live away from Earth .
In the future , Miklica believes , we will think of machines as intelligent partners obeying our commands , which may sound sinister , " but it is n't scarier than the first arrival of trains to the cities . "
Miklica 's design is also intended to be good for morale on silent and desolate Mars , as the robot is cute enough to be treated as a pet or confidante .
It is also a great gardener that will grow any plant you need or want .
When asked what consumer research Miklica had done for his design he admitted it is difficult to do any since it is designed for Mars , but some of his friends said it was cute " and I consider their feedback sufficient . "
The winner of the competition will be selected by a team of international designers on September 24 at 100 % Design , a leading design and architecture event in London .

Par Jules , de la République des blogs • Écartons la considérable abstention qui se profile , et voyons comment seront attribués les sièges des représentants français au Parlement européen .
Car , ils seront bel et bien pourvus , n’en déplaise aux pêcheurs et pécheurs du dimanche .
Comme chacun le sait - ou non- chaque
Etat membre fixe librement les modalités électives de ceux qu’il députe au Parlement européen .
En France , c’est la loi n° 77-729 du 7 juillet 1977 , relative à l’élection des représentants au Parlement européen , qui les détermine dans son article 3 .
« L’élection a lieu , par circonscription , au scrutin de liste à la représentation proportionnelle , sans panachage ni vote préférentiel .
Les sièges sont répartis , dans la circonscription , entre les listes ayant obtenu au moins 5 % des suffrages exprimés à la représentation proportionnelle suivant la règle de la plus forte moyenne .
Si plusieurs listes ont la même moyenne pour l’attribution du dernier siège , celui- ci revient à la liste qui a obtenu le plus grand nombre de suffrages .
En cas d’égalité de suffrages , le siège est attribué à la liste dont la moyenne d’âge est la plus élevée .
Les sièges sont attribués aux candidats d’après l’ordre de présentation sur chaque liste . »
Il s’agit donc d’une élection “ à la représentation proportionnelle “ .
Simple dans son principe , effroyablement complexe par les ajustements qu’elle suppose .
L’idée générale est que les sièges sont répartis en fonction des votes obtenus .
Les candidats d’une liste se trouvent élus proportionnellement aux suffrages recueillis .
Mais comment ?
Il faut tout d’abord calculer ce que l’on appelle le quotient électoral .
C’est - à - dire la mesure qui permet de déterminer le nombre de voix nécessaire pour obtenir un siège .
Il s’obtient en divisant le nombre de suffrages exprimés par le nombre de sièges à pourvoir .
Exit , donc , les abstentionnistes et les votes blancs .
Ce qui est une bonne chose , car l’élection est avant tout un instrument de désignation des représentants ; en sus de l’expression des sensibilités et humeurs politiques .
Illustration .
Admettons que 3,5 millions d’électeurs s’expriment valablement dans la circonscription Ile - de - France .
Cette dernière , aux termes du décret n° 2009 - 317 du 20 mars 2009 fixant le nombre de sièges et le nombre de candidats par circonscription pour l’élection des représentants au Parlement européen , offre 13 sièges à pourvoir .
Le quotient électoral est donc de 3 500 000/13 , soit 269.230 voix nécessaires pour obtenir un siège .
Bien , mais que fait - on des restes ?
— Quels restes ?
Et bien , si sage que soit le corps électoral , il est rare que la multitude parvienne à diviser son vote en parts égales de quotient électoral .
Admettons , pour la bonne forme , que l’UMP obtienne 25 % des votes , le PS 20 % , le modem 15 % , les verts , 10 % , le parti de gauche , 7 % , le NPA , 7 % , le FN et Libertas , 5 % , et que le reste des listes obtienne ensemble les 6 % restant , sans que l’une dépasse les 5 % nécessaires pour être représentés .
Les sièges sont d’abord attribués en fonction du quotient électoral :
Mais comme on peut le voir , toutes les voix — il s’en faut de beaucoup — ne sont pas représentées ( 1.615.390/3.500.000 ) , non plus que les sièges attribués — il en reste 6 .
Par ailleurs , certaines listes n’ont pas d’élus .
Comment , donc pourvoir les six sièges restants ?
Il existe deux systèmes : celui du plus fort reste et celui de la plus forte moyenne .
Le plus fort reste consiste à attribuer les sièges en fonction des vois restantes non représentées .
C’est ainsi que le Modem récupèrerait un siège ; idem du Parti de gauche et du NPA , puis du FN et de Libertas , et enfin du PS .
De sorte que l’UMP se trouverait à égalité en siège avec le PS .
Mais ce n’est pas la méthode retenue par la loi de 2003 : celle de la plus forte moyenne .
Le système généralement adopté pour calculer la plus forte moyenne consiste à attribuer fictivement les sièges restants à chaque liste et à calculer la moyenne de voix obtenue alors par chaque liste .
Les sièges restants sont ensuite attribués selon la plus forte moyenne calculée .
On vérifie donc que le choix de la plus forte moyenne ou du plus fort reste peut sensiblement modifier les résultats .
La plus forte moyenne , en l’occurrence , privilégie les plus grands scores , puisque Libertas et le FN sont privés de siège , alors que l’UMP en obtient un supplémentaire .
Notons encore que trois listes obtiennent une moyenne égale alors qu’elles se disputent le dernier siège .
La règle veut qu’il soit attribué de préférence à la liste qui a obtenu le plus grands nombre de voix .
Dans le cas très improbable où cela ne suffirait pas , on se fonde sur le classique et gérontocrate critère de l’âge .
On constate au demeurant que le système dit “ proportionnel ” est loin de donner une représentation fidèle des forces politiques en présence , et conduit à des distorsions .
Distorsions d’autant plus grandes , d’ailleurs , que la circonscription est réduite .
Avec la France comme circonscription unique , les petites formations politiques auraient de grandes chances d’obtenir un représentant , alors qu’elles peuvent perdre cette possibilité lorsque l’on multiplie les circonscriptions .
Bref , l’étrange système de circonscriptions de la loi de 2003 vise à favoriser les formations les plus puissantes au détriment des plus réduites , tout en conservant à ces dernières une possibilité de représentation .
Un mot , pour conclure , sur l’étrange formule de la loi : “ Sans panachage ni vote préférentiel “ .
Le panachage consiste à laisser l’électeur choisir des noms sur plusieurs listes .
Ainsi , si je suis Vérel , je choisis Michel Barnier et Daniel Cohn - Bendit sur les listes UMP et Verts , mais délaisse Rachida Dati et José Bové , dont l’implication dans le projet européen me semble discutable .
Il convient cependant de ne pas se méprendre .
La proportionnelle est un scrutin de liste .
C’est pourquoi le panachage ne conduit pas à choisir ses candidats préférés .
On fait la somme des voix recueillies par les candidats de chaque liste , et on calcule la moyenne des suffrages par liste pour attribuer les sièges .
En sorte que Rachida Dati , nonobstant le panachage , serait probablement élue , mais que son faible score — en admettant un grand nombre d’électeurs Vérel — pèserait sur les candidats suivants de la liste UMP .
Pour choisir son candidat et en éliminer d’autres , c’est au vote préférentiel qu’il faut recourir .
Le vote préférentiel permet de réorganiser sa liste d’élection et de placer , qui José Bové , qui Rachida Dati , en fin de liste .
L’ordre définitif de la liste dépend de la pondération effectuée par les électeurs , qui , il faut le dire , font un maigre usage de cet instrument lorsqu’il leur est offert .
Mais cette liberté n’est pas offerte à l’électeur français , ce qui permet aux formations politiques de maîtriser peu ou prou les candidatures qu’elles souhaitent favoriser .
Et l’on observe ainsi que dans un système proportionnel , l’électeur perd un peu de sa capacité de choix de ses représentants .
Du moins , face aux partis politiques .
Et c’est sur cette dernière remarque que je laisse mes bons lecteurs méditer leur choix dominical en pleine connaissance de son fruit électoral .
1. La dernière modification en date du texte date de la Loi n°2003 - 327 du 11 avril 2003 relative à l’élection des conseillers régionaux et des représentants au Parlement européen ainsi qu’à l’aide publique aux partis politiques .
2 . A noter au reste que si l’on tenait compte des bulletins blancs et abstentions , le seuil des 5 % ne permettrait pas à beaucoup de listes de se maintenir , et cela favoriserait mécaniquement les listes en têtes .
En quoi les motivations de rejet du vote blanc ou de l’abstention manqueraient significativement leur objet .
3 . En l’occurrence , l’âge moyen de la liste .

Swaziland 's flag .
The colors go well together and the design is interesting ; unfortunately , this is not a kitchen towel .
While we 're sure the shield and spears are traditional and part of Swaziland 's culture , having weapons in your flag just sends the wrong message , not to mention the poor school children in Swaziland .
Trying to make an accurate drawing of this flag for independence day must be a nightmare .
Is anyone even surprised by now that we have another Cardi B plastic surgery rumor on our hands ?
Probably not .
Let ’s look at all the records of her suspected surgeries and procedures .
What Does Cardi B Say About Her Plastic Surgery Rumors ?
Cardi B has always been open about surgeries in the past before attaining worldwide recognition for her music .
She had admitted to breast augmentation and illegal butt injections during her career as an exotic dancer .
But what about facial surgeries after becoming a multiple Grammy - winning artist ?
Nothing .
She has neither denied nor confirmed her going under the knife despite images of her covering alleged surgery scars circulating the web .
What Her Fans and Experts Have To Say ?
Her fans have always supported her originality and unfiltered personality , but what about plastic surgery news ?
Well , the jury is still out as she seems to have entered an equilibrium where neither faction of fans nor critics can overpower each other .
Some support her decisions to modify herself as they see it being part of the industry .
On the other hand , many argue that she has basically fast - tracked her career through rapid alterations to herself .
Moreover , plastic surgery experts claim she might have gone under the knife more than anyone initially believed .
Cardi B Nose Job / Rhinoplasty Surgery :
Looking at the images from the beginning of her career , one can outright see how her nose has changed to date .
The nose is distinctively sharper and narrower as compared to her used - to - be button nose .
This leaves no doubt in anyone ’s mind .
Furthermore , many have started to compare her to her arch - nemesis , Nicki Minaj .
Cardi B Lip Face Lift Surgery :
Cardi B sent fans and media into a frenzy when she went Christmas shopping in a mall last December .
She had no makeup on and her jawlines could clearly be seen as well defined .
Additionally , it appeared though that her neck was more smoothed out .
Furthermore , her eyebrows seemed much more arched than before when she attended an event later that week .
There is practically zero to minor differences between Cardi B and Nicki Minaj now as both look almost identical .
Cardi B Dental Veneers :
The rapper had always struggled with her teeth ever since she made an appearance in the reality show that launched her into a megastar .
She was proud of her appearance until she was bullied and trolled online for her misshaped and mismatched teeth .
Eventually , she went public with her dentist appointment of a whopping 40 thousand dollar bill .
This is to date still one of her most talked - about procedures .
Even her dentist has gone on to become a known personality with her ever - expanding client list .
We do not know about you , but we sure as hell about this procedure in particular .
What are your thoughts on Cardi B ’s plastic surgery ?
Would you like to hear more about her other surgeries ?
We will be waiting for you in the comments section !
As if bushfires , drought and floods are n't enough , Australians have now been warned about a volcanic eruption .
A scientist says an eruption is " well overdue " and there are hundreds of volcanoes that could cause trouble , from South Australia and Victoria through to Queensland .
Melbourne geologist Bernie Joyce wants " eruption response plans " drawn up .
He says there are 400 volcanoes in Victoria and South Australia , and almost as many in Queensland .
" A significant eruption seems well overdue , " said Professor Joyce , who has been associated with the University of Melbourne .
Rep. Dennis Kucinich ( D — Ohio ) says healthcare is “ the next civil rights movement ”
Get the flash player here : http://www.adobe.com/flashplayer
If last night proved anything , it ’s that nothing gets a Georgetown classroom packed like one of the most liberal members of Congress discussing what he considers “ the next civil rights movement ” — healthcare .
During his speech , Congressman Dennis Kucinich ( D — Ohio ) focused primarily on the importance of passing the bill he co-authored , HR 676 , or , “ Medicare for All . ”
The bill would take the existing Medicare system and expand it cover everyone .
Of course , the big question is how such an expansion would be paid for .
Kucinich ’s comeback to that concern was that “ We ’re already paying for a universal standard of care we ’re not getting . ”
“ 2.4 trillion dollars a year we spend on healthcare in America , ” he explained in his speech .
“ One out of every 3 dollars , or $ 800 million a year goes for corporate profit , stock options , executive salaries , advertising , and the cost of paperwork .
So the for - profit healthcare system has a lot at stake here . ”
Kucinich also mused on the current healthcare bill ’s prospects in Congress , saying he predicts the House will have a public option in its version , but the Senate wo n’t .
“ The public option is not likely to survive a conference committee , ” he said .
During the question and answer portion of the talk , he also expressed disagreement with the idea that passing Senate Finance Chairman Max Bachus ’s ( D — Mont . ) healthcare bill would be “ better than nothing ” and criticized the power that has been given to insurance companies .

Keith Floyd , who has died of a heart attack aged 65 , will be best remembered for his television cookery programmes in the late 1980s and early 1990s – the epitome of gonzo - TV – as wine destined for the pot was drunk instead by the presenter .
Cheerful mayhem was the consequence , though attentive viewers learned sound basics of flavour and technique .
Floyd 's performances , on or near the stove , were a refreshing departure from the prissy , controlled style then in favour at the BBC , or the alternative mode of half an hour with a French chef whose incomprehensible English made the recipes a mystery .
Floyd came to public performance after a long and , he would have said , punishing apprenticeship in running restaurants .
Brought up on the slopes of the Quantocks and Exmoor , hence , perhaps , his love of game , fishing and the odd rook for the pot ( his father was a keen field sportsman ) , he was educated at Wellington school , in Somerset , where a fellow pupil was Jeffrey Archer .
Electing for a career in journalism , he found this not to his liking and joined the army , gaining a commission in the 3rd Royal Tank Regiment in 1963 .
He claimed that his rush of military blood was inspired by the heroics of Stanley Baker and Michael Caine in Zulu , though in fact that film was not released until 1964 .
In reality , his regiment was stationed in Germany where , though he was only a subaltern , his responsibilities extended to the meals in the officers ' mess .
On those nights that he was on duty the cooks were encouraged to produce high - falutin ' French dishes in preference to roast meat and two veg .
His catering skills , however , did nothing to prolong his military career , which was soon abandoned for an Orwellian stint of kitchen portering and restaurant work in London and France , before he returned to the West Country in 1966 .
Somehow , and somewhere , he had learned enough about cookery to open Floyd 's Bistro in Bristol , in the Georgian district of Clifton , where the posh people , students and broadcasters lived .
Floyd was a natural cook of great skill , and a restaurateur and host of effervescent charm .
However , he was an appalling businessman who rarely kept hold of his money for long enough to pay the bills that mattered , while often charging his customers over the odds for his wares .
His perception of the ambivalent role of the restaurateur – somewhere between pander and provider – was clear and forcefully expressed , sometimes too forcefully for his own good .
His first Bristol period ended in the sale of the restaurant in the early 1970s .
Floyd took off on his yacht , Flirty , to lotus - eat in the Mediterranean for a couple of years .
When money got tight , he began exporting antiques to France and importing wine to England .
Then , when in turn the customs regulations became tight , he opened his own small restaurant in the Provençal town of L'Isle - sur - la - Sorgue .
Not far from Avignon , its main claim to fame is that it contains the greatest concentration of antique shops in mainland France ( 300 and counting ) .
It says much for Floyd 's bravura that he succeeded where many Englishmen have failed .
Success , though , is a relative term and when he did return to Bristol in 1979 - 80 it was without a penny to his name .
He was only able to go back into business , with another restaurant called Floyd's , courtesy of friends who stumped up the capital as advances on meals yet to be cooked .
Extravagance , incompetence and the VAT bill would have done for him a third and even final time had he not been rescued by unlikely fame in broadcasting .
The chain of coincidence began with a small book from a local publisher called Floyd 's Food ( 1981 , with a foreword by the actor Leonard Rossiter ) which led to 10 - minute recipe chats on the Bristol station Radio West ; these in turn developed into a short - lived yet garrulous phone - in .
By then something of a local hero , he was tried out on TV , where his first foray culminated with him roasting a guinea fowl complete with giblets in their plastic bag ( a Julia Child moment ) .
More successful was a short film of him cooking made by David Pritchard , then at BBC Bristol .
This might have come to nothing had not Pritchard been relocated to Plymouth and able to propose a new series on fish cookery .
A pilot show was made at the end of 1984 and Floyd On Fish went out in the summer of 1985 .
Pritchard 's style of direction was exactly suited to that of his presenter .
Inspired by chaos , Floyd would address the crew as often as the camera , would get palpably squiffy as programmes wore on , would indulge in any manner of derring - do ( from playing rugby with Welshmen to shooting seals and eating puffins ) and would be lovably madcap .
Yet the cookery content was red - hot , copper - bottomed stuff .
Never refined , but still good .
Success was reinforced , and financed , by popular books to go with each series – Floyd On France ( 1987 ) , Floyd On Britain and Ireland ( 1988 ) , Floyd On Oz ( 1991 ) , Floyd On Spain ( 1992 ) , Far Flung Floyd ( 1993 ) , Floyd On Italy ( 1994 ) – and the partnership continued swimmingly ( though never without friction ) until 1994 when there was a bust - up .
Thereafter , Floyd carried on in much the same style for commercial channels – with several series on Channel Five – national tourist offices and anyone who would put up the money .
His long - term popularity was as great , if not greater , outside the UK .
It often seemed that a Floyd programme was showing on at least two airlines and in a hundred hotel lobbies at any given moment .
If his media life seemed a treadmill – it included a one - man show complete with piano and vocal backing – he still found time at the beginning of the 1990s to start another restaurant .
This was the pub the Maltsters Arms ( rechristened Floyd 's Inn ) in a hamlet near Dartmouth , in Devon .
There he drove his white convertible Bentley through narrow lanes , got married for the third time , to Shaunagh Mullet ( though she left him after he accused her of forgetting his 50th birthday ) , and built up colossal debts .
We were dining peacefully one night in his pub when the hum of conversation was silenced by the crack of breaking china as Keith responded to a complaint from the couple he was serving .
You tangled gently with Keith , especially ( as someone remarked ) after 9.20 pm when the smiling , witty chef in a bow tie was likely to be subverted by red wine and paranoia .
The debts were cleared by a distress sale , in 1996 , and disappearance to Ireland .
A fourth marriage followed , to Theresa Smith ( which also ended in divorce ) , and removal to Marbella , before a return to his old haunts in Provence .
A life that seemed punctuated by bankruptcy and bust - ups was nonetheless full of achievement and hard work : 19 series for television , 25 books , as well as countless public appearances , not to mention a good dozen restaurants , including his last venture , Floyd 's Brasserie , launched in 2007 at Burasari resort on the Thai island of Phuket .
In 2001 he published Out of the Frying Pan : Scenes from My Life ; another autobiography , Stirred But Not Shaken , is due for release next month .
Floyd is survived by a son , Patrick , from his first marriage , and a daughter , Poppy , from his second .
• Keith Floyd , cook , born 28 December 1943 ; died 14 September 2009

Amid the sea of individuals actively involved in National Poker Week was Mickey Leibner , a lobbyist for the Poker Players Alliance ( PPA ) .
Leibner sat down with Poker News Daily to discuss lobbying for the legalization and regulation of online poker in the United States .
Poker News Daily :
How did you become involved with lobbying on behalf of the PPA ?
Leibner : I work with former Congressman Toby Moffett and have been lobbying on behalf of the PPA since the fall of 2007 .
Our policy is that we wo n’t lobby for any causes we do n’t believe in .
We want to go to Capitol Hill with clients who have a good story to tell .
The PPA and the poker world have a great story to tell .
It ’s a message of personal freedoms .
PND : You mentioned personal freedoms .
Does that resonate with Congressmen when you lobby about the issue ?
Leibner :
It does resonate .
One of the interesting things about this issue is that it truly resonates across the aisle – Democrats and Republicans .
I personally am a big - time Democrat , but there are people we meet with on both sides of the aisle that like this issue for different reasons .
PND : What ’s an average day for a lobbyist ?
Leibner :
We do a lot of preparation , like crafting memos for staff and gathering the most relevant information on an issue .
What we do is based on our knowledge of a particular Congressman , district , office , or staff member – We tend to tailor what we say so it will have the greatest effect .
You want to make sure that you ’re using the right arguments with a rural Republican Representative and those are probably different arguments than you ’d use with an urban Democrat , for example .
PND : You told us earlier that your firm also lobbies on behalf of environmental issues and other efforts .
Is it difficult juggling several different commitments ?
Leibner :
It ’s not necessarily hard and it keeps it interesting .
I actually like it because every day is a little bit different .
I can wake up every morning knowing that everything I ’m doing is something I can get behind and feel good about .
That makes a big difference .
PND : How did you begin your lobbying career ?
Leibner : I ’ve been politically involved for a while .
I graduated from college and really did n’t know what I was going to do .
I wanted to be in politics .
I focused a lot in college on the intersection of technology and politics , so I wrote a thesis on the world of blogs .
I was looking at a number of non-profits and organizations outside of the government and I happened to get in with Toby Moffett .
It ’s neat because the poker issue allows me to work on the intersection of technology and politics .
PND : What is your forecast for the future of internet gambling legislation in the United States in 2009 and 2010 ?
Leibner :
We ’re very hopeful and we ’re very confident that we can get these laws passed .
We have a lot of powerful people on our side , including Barney Frank , who is the Chairman of the House Financial Services Committee .
It just so happens that we ’re in the midst of the biggest financial crisis in the past few decades .
We ’re confident that our message is getting through .
We hope that HR 2266 , which is the bill to delay the implementation of the regulations of the Unlawful Internet Gambling Enforcement Act ( UIGEA ) by one year –
We ’re hopeful that we can get something done on that as soon as we get back from the August recess .
That ’s the plan .
Tell your readers that we ’re out there every day and trying to bust our butts to get this done .
We ’re pretty confident and feel better than we did a year ago at this time .
* Urges Air Force start developing modified fighter
* Japan , Israel , Australia have shown interest
* Bill ends F - 22 production for U.S. Air Force
( Adds call to end ban on exports of F - 22 jet fighter )
By Jim Wolf
WASHINGTON , Sept 10 ( Reuters ) - A Senate panel urged the Air Force on Thursday to start developing an export model of its F - 22 Raptor , the most advanced U.S. fighter jet , even as it voted to end U.S. purchases .
Japan , Israel and Australia have shown interest in buying the supersonic , radar - evading F - 22 Raptor , designed to destroy enemy air defenses in the first days of any conflict and clear the way for other missions .
Foreign sales were banned by a 1998 law aimed at protecting the “ stealth ” technology and other high - tech features said to have made the F - 22 too good for money to buy .
If enacted , the measure adopted by the Senate Appropriations Committee would let the Defense Department prepare a modified F - 22 that protects classified and sensitive information , technologies and U.S. war fighting capabilities .
“ The committee urges the Air Force to start this effort within the funds appropriated in Research , Development , Test and Evaluation , Air Force , for the F - 22 aircraft , ” a report accompanying the bill said .
Neither Lockheed Martin nor the Air Force had any immediate comment .
Creating an export version would preserve U.S. jobs and an option to buy more F - 22s later , without having to pay the full cost of restarting production .
The U.S. Air Force has estimated Japan would have to spend as much as $ 2.3 billion for development of its own version of the Raptor .
For years ,
Tokyo has sought to buy two squadrons of the F - 22 , possibly 40 planes , a request that has become more compelling amid tensions with neighboring North Korea .
The bill , adopted 30 to 0 in 15 minutes without debate , largely backed program cuts sought by President Barack Obama .
Overall , it provided $ 636.3 billion for defense in fiscal 2010 , which starts Oct. 1 .
The measure would kill a combat search - and - rescue helicopter , a presidential helicopter and a missile - defense project called Kinetic Energy Interceptor .
It includes $ 128.2 billion for “ overseas contingency operations , ” primarily to keep fighting wars in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The legislation would cap the U.S. F - 22 “ Raptor ” fleet at 187 , down from an original Air Force Cold War -era plan to buy as many as 750 of the air - superiority fighters .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates , announcing plans to terminate the F - 22 on April 6 , said doing so was “ not a close call . ”
He said the military should gear up more for wars such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan .
The bill , which must be reconciled with the House of Representatives ’ version , provided no funds for a second , interchangeable engine for the F - 35 Joint Strike Fighter .
The alternate engine , which Obama considers wasteful , would be veto bait , the White House has said .
In July , the House approved $ 560 million for the second engine development as part of its 2010 defense appropriations bill , despite the veto threat .
General Electric Co GE.N and Rolls - Royce Group PLC RR.L , partners in the second engine , have said they are confident a House - Senate conference committee will preserve competition for the F - 35 engine .
Sen .
Daniel Inouye , the Hawaii Democrat who chairs the appropriations committee and its defense subpanel , told reporters he did not know how the second engine ’s fate would play out .
“ Apparently the Senate is not for it , so we ’ll go into conference on that basis .
But as always , my mind is open , ” he said .
The Senate panel put rival United Technologies Corp's UTX.N Pratt & Whitney unit , maker of a fully funded engine for the F - 35 , a step closer to a monopoly over a projected $ 100 billion market .
At issue is the engine and its aftermarket for three variants of the F - 35 , a single - engine Lockheed Martin fighter in early stages of production .
It would replace at least 13 types of warplanes , initially for 11 nations .
The Senate committee , in sync with recommendations made Wednesday by its defense subpanel , broke with Obama on Boeing Co's BA.N C - 17 cargo plane .
It added $ 2.5 billion to sustain the production line by buying 10 more in 2010 .

Production of crops such as maize and palm oil fuelling poverty and environmental damage in poor countries , says Christian Aid
This article is more than 11 years old
This article is more than 11 years old
The production of biofuels is fuelling poverty , human rights abuses and damage to the environment , Christian Aid warned today .
The charity said huge subsidies and targets in developed countries for boosting the production of fuels from plants such as maize and palm oil are exacerbating environmental and social problems in poor nations .
And rather than being a " silver bullet " to tackle climate change , the carbon emissions of some of the fuels are higher than fossil fuels because of deforestation driven by the need for land for them to grow .
According to a report , Growing Pains , by Christian Aid , industrial scale production of biofuels is worsening problems such as food price hikes in central America , forced displacement of small farmers for plantations and pollution of local water sources .
But with 2.4 billion people worldwide currently without secure sources of energy for cooking and heating , Christian Aid believes the renewable fuels do have the potential to help the poor .
The charity highlights schemes such as the growing of jatropha in Mali , where the plant is raised between food crops and the oil from the seeds is used to run village generators which can power appliances such as stoves and lights .
The report argues that talking about " good " or " bad " biofuels is oversimplifying the situation , and the problem is not with the crop or fuel – but the policies surrounding them .
Developed countries have poured subsidies into biofuel production – for example in the US where between 9.2 billion dollars and 11 billion dollars went to supporting maize - based ethanol in 2008 – when there are cheaper and more effective ways to cut emissions from transport , the report said .
The charity said biofuels production needed a " new vision " – a switch from supplying significant quantities of transport fuel for industrial markets to helping poor people have access to clean energy .
The report 's author Eliot Whittington , climate advocacy specialist for Christian Aid , said : " Vast sums of European and American taxpayers ' money are being used to prop up industries which are fuelling hunger , severe human rights abuses and environmental destruction — and failing to deliver the benefits claimed for them . "
He said the current approach to biofuels had been " disastrous " .
He added : " Christian Aid believes that the best approach to biofuels is to grow them on a small scale and process them locally to provide energy for people in the surrounding countryside .
This can also increase rural people 's incomes and has the potential to actually increase soil fertility and moisture retention , without compromising people 's food security . "

Bob Herbert writes about the unemployed :
Fifteen million Americans are locked in the nightmare of unemployment , nearly 10 percent of the work force .
A third have been jobless for more than six months .
Thirteen percent of Latinos and 15 percent of blacks are out of work .
( Those are some of the official statistics .
The reality is much worse . ) …. A national survey of jobless workers by a pair of professors at Rutgers University shows just how traumatized the work force has become in this downturn .
Two - thirds of respondents said that they had become depressed .
More than half said it was the first time they had ever lost a job , and 80 percent said there was little or no chance that they would be able to get their jobs back when the economy improves .
….
It ’s eerie to me how little attention this crisis is receiving .
The poor seem to be completely out of the picture .
It is kind of eerie , and I ’ve noticed the difference in mood too .
It ’s true that the unemployment rate is n’t quite as high ( yet ) as it got in 1981 - 82 , but it ’s pretty damn close — and yet the tone of news coverage seems quite different .
My recollection of the early 80s is of lots and lots of coverage of plant closures , homelessness , food banks , and a serious sense of panic and despair .
This time , not so much .
Has this been purely a difference in media coverage ?
A difference in the way unemployment is distributed ?
The fact that hard times have only been with us for about a year so far ?
A genuine difference in the way people are reacting ?
Or what ?
I really do n’t know the answer .
But yes , it feels quite different than it did in 1981 .
Help me out , fellow oldsters .
Does it feel different to you too ?
Or am I just imagining this ?
The lobbying firm that sent forged letters opposing the House climate bill to at least three members of Congress was working on behalf of the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity , one of the top Washington , D.C. - based coal industry advocacy groups .
A total of 12 forged letters were sent out to three House Democrats -- Reps. Tom Perriello of Virginia and Kathy Dahlkemper and Chris Carney of Pennsylvania .
Both Carney and Dahlkemper voted against the House climate bill ( H.R. 2454 ( pdf ) ) , while Perriello supported the measure and has faced a storm of criticism from Washington Republicans and some constituents in the wake of its passage .
ACCCE , which represents a number of major electric utilities and coal producers , said it had no knowledge of the forged letters until after they had been sent out by an employee of Bonner & Associates .
" We are outraged at the conduct of Bonner & Associates , " ACCCE President and CEO Stephen Miller said in a statement yesterday .
" Based upon the information we have , it is clear that an employee of Bonner 's firm failed to demonstrate the integrity we demand of all our contractors and subcontractors . "
ACCCE revealed yesterday that one of its contractors , the Hawthorn Group , had subcontracted with Bonner & Associates to conduct outreach to community - based groups in several congressional districts .
ACCCE was aware of this arrangement , but it was Hawthorn that was responsible for managing Bonner 's work .
A newspaper report Friday first disclosed the forged letters sent to Perriello 's office , which were made to look as if they had come from two Charlottesville - based advocacy groups .
But the letters were signed by individuals that had no affiliation to the organizations and the letters had instead been traced back to the D.C. - based lobbying firm Bonner & Associates .
" Obviously , we 're learning more everyday about the fake letters and we are looking forward to the results of Chairman Markey 's investigation , " Perriello spokeswoman Jessica Barba said in response to the ACCCE disclosure .
According to a background document provided by ACCCE , it was Bonner & Associates that had first identified the letters through the internal review process and had informed Hawthorn Group about the situation .
Hawthorn then informed ACCCE about the matter on June 24 -- more than a month before it was reported by the media .
In an interview , Miller said as soon as ACCCE was informed of the situation , it immediately contacted Hawthorn and was told that Bonner would reach out to the community organizations and to the congressional offices that received the letters .
" As we continued to inquire about that during July , that was the message we receive from Hawthorn , " Miller said .
" It was not until the press accounts Friday afternoon that we learned this matter had not been dealt with . "
Miller added that ACCCE did not communicate directly with Bonner about the situation , but it was informed that the employee responsible for the letters had been fired .
Additionally , Miller said he paid a visit yesterday to the Capitol Hill offices of the members who received the false letters and would seek face - to - face meetings or phone conversations with those lawmakers .
The House is on recess until Labor Day .
ACCCE will also reach out personally to the organizations whose names were used in the letter , Miller said .
Congressional investigation begins
Rep. Ed Markey ( D - Mass. ) , chairman of the Select Committee on Energy Independence and Global Warming and one of the main authors of the climate bill , sent a letter yesterday to Jack Bonner of Bonner & Associates asking a dozen lengthy questions about the letters .
Among other things , Markey asked Bonner to disclose who hired it to lobby on their behalf , how much it was paid , in which congressional districts it operates in , the extent of its activities in those districts as well as information about the employee that was responsible for the mailing of the letters .
" This fraud on Congress distorts the legislative process and disserves the American people , " Markey wrote .
" It represents a serious breach that needs to be fully understood as to the extent and scope of these wrongful acts . "
Markey 's letter went out before ACCCE revealed its connection to the matter and it does not mention the group .
Bonner has until Aug. 12 to respond .
But ACCCE 's involvement in the matter immediately drew a sharp rebuke from environmentalists , with one prominent environmental group calling for both Congress and the Justice Department to dig into the matter .
" Both the coal industry 's ACCCE and Bonner have denounced the sneaky tactics and firmly placed blame elsewhere , " the Sierra Club executive director Carl Pope .
" It is clear that the Department of Justice and Congress may be the only ones that can really figure out who is responsible for these dirty tricks . "
Adding , " Big Oil , Big Coal and other special interests have already spent more than $ 100 million to kill a comprehensive clean energy jobs and climate plan .
By faking these letters , Bonner and the special interests they represent admit that an army of lobbyists and hundreds of millions of dollars still can't overcome real grassroots power . "
The group yesterday sent a letter to Attorney General Eric Holder urging for an investigation into the matter ( E&ENews PM , August 3 ) .
The letters have only further escalated what has already been a highly charged political debate over the climate legislation .
Besides Markey 's investigation and similar calls from the Sierra Club , a number of other left - leaning advocacy groups and commentators had pounced on the issue , charging that the letters were part of a campaign by some industry groups that used inaccurate information to attempt to defeat the climate bill .
The Sierra Club this week will run print ads in Washington , D.C. - based political publications that depict Bigfoot , aliens , Pinocchio and other fictional characters under the banner " The Coalition to Kill Clean Energy Jobs . "
States the ad : " When Dirty - Energy Washington Lobbyists could n't get any real - life supporters to defeat comprehensive clean energy and climate legislation , they made them up instead . "
But ACCCE 's Miller said he still believed that the controversy would not overshadow the group 's effort to articulate its position on the climate bill as the debate turns toward the Senate .
" I continue to have faith that when a problem like this occurs and it's not your wrongdoing yourself , but you 're willing to step up responsibility for making it right , people will recognize that here in Washington , " Miller said .
" I hope and believe that if you 're wiling to do that and come forward in this kind of situation , you will continue to be able to make credible arguments . "

When naively profiling multi- threaded applications the time spent waiting for mutexes is not necessarily visible in the generated output .
However lock contention can have a big impact on the runtime behaviour of applications .
On Linux valgrind 's drd can be used to track down mutex contention .
Unfortunately running applications under valgrind / drd slows them down massively , often having the effect of itself generating many of the contentions one is trying to track down .
Also due to its slowness it is very time consuming work .
To improve the situation if have now written a mutex profiler called mutrace .
In contrast to valgrind / drd it does not virtualize the CPU instruction set , making it a lot faster .
In fact , the hooks mutrace relies on to profile mutex operations should only minimally influence application runtime .
mutrace is not useful for finding synchronizations bugs , it is solely useful for profiling locks .
Now , enough of this introductionary blabla .
Let 's have a look on the data mutrace can generate for you .
As an example we 'll look at gedit as a bit of a prototypical Gnome application .
Gtk+ and the other Gnome libraries are not really known for their heavy use of multi- threading , and the APIs are generally not thread - safe ( for a good reason ) .
However , internally subsytems such as gio do use threading quite extensibly .
And as it turns out there are a few hotspots that can be discovered with mutrace :
$ LD_PRELOAD=/home/lennart/projects/mutrace/libmutrace.so gedit mutrace : 0.1 sucessfully initialized .
gedit is now running and its mutex use is being profiled .
For this example I have now opened a file with it , typed a few letters and then quit the program again without saving .
As soon as gedit exits mutrace will print the profiling data it gathered to stderr .
The full output you can see here .
The most interesting part is at the end of the generated output , a breakdown of the most contended mutexes :
mutrace : 10 most contended mutexes : Mutex # Locked Changed Cont. tot. Time [ms ] avg .
Time [ms ] max .
Time [ms ]
Type 35 368268 407 275 120,822 0,000 0,894 normal 5 234645 100 21 86,855 0,000 0,494 normal 26 177324 47 4 98,610 0,001 0,150 normal 19 55758 53 2 23,931 0,000 0,092 normal 53 106 73 1 0,769 0,007 0,160 normal 25 15156 70 1 6,633 0,000 0,019 normal 4 973 10 1 4,376 0,004 0,174 normal 75 68 62 0 0,038 0,001 0,004 normal 9 1663 52 0 1,068 0,001 0,412 normal 3 136553 41 0 61,408 0,000 0,281 normal ... ... ... ... ... ... ... ... mutrace : Total runtime 9678,142 ms .
( Sorry , LC_NUMERIC was set to de_DE.UTF - 8 , so if you can't make sense of all the commas , think s/,/./g !)
For each mutex a line is printed .
The ' Locked ' column tells how often the mutex was locked during the entire runtime of about 10s .
The ' Changed ' column tells us how often the owning thread of the mutex changed .
The ' Cont . ' column tells us how often the lock was already taken when we tried to take it and we had to wait .
The fifth column tell us for how long during the entire runtime the lock was locked , the sixth tells us the average lock time , and the seventh column tells us the longest time the lock was held .
Finally , the last column tells us what kind of mutex this is ( recursive , normal or otherwise ) .
The most contended lock in the example above is # 35 .
275 times during the runtime a thread had to wait until another thread released this mutex .
All in all more then 120ms of the entire runtime ( about 10s ) were spent with this lock taken !
In the full output we can now look up which mutex # 35 actually is :
Mutex # 35 ( 0x0x7f48c7057d28 ) first referenced by : /home/lennart/projects/mutrace/libmutrace.so(pthread_mutex_lock+0x70 ) [ 0x7f48c97dc900 ]

As it appears in this Gtk+ program the rwlock type_rw_lock ( defined in glib 's gobject / gtype.c ) is a hotspot .
GLib 's rwlocks are implemented on top of mutexes , so an obvious attempt in improving this could be to actually make them use the operating system 's rwlock primitives .
If a mutex is used often but only ever by the same thread it cannot starve other threads .
The ' Changed . ' column lists how often a specific mutex changed the owning thread .
If the number is high this means the risk of contention is also high .
The ' Cont . ' column tells you about contention that actually took place .
Due to the way mutrace works we cannot profile mutexes that are used internally in glibc , such as those used for synchronizing stdio and suchlike .
mutrace is implemented entirely in userspace .
It uses all kinds of exotic GCC , glibc and kernel features , so you might have a hard time compiling and running it on anything but a very recent Linux distribution .
I have tested it on Rawhide but it should work on slightly older distributions , too .
Make sure to build your application with - rdynamic to make the backtraces mutrace generates useful .
As of now , mutrace only profiles mutexes .
Adding support for rwlocks should be easy to add though .
Patches welcome .
The output mutrace generates can be influenced by various MUTRACE_xxx environment variables .
See the sources for more information .
And now , please take mutrace and profile and speed up your application !

Israel 's foreign minister has described the newspaper report as a blood libel
Israel is to lodge an official complaint with Sweden over claims in a newspaper that Israeli soldiers killed Palestinians to sell their organs .
The article was published in the Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet this week .
The Swedish ambassador to Israel condemned the newspaper article as " shocking and appalling " .
The government in Stockholm has not issued a similar condemnation , and Israeli foreign ministry officials have reacted furiously .
[ This ] reminds one of Sweden 's conduct during World War II , when it also did not intervene
Avigdor Lieberman
Israeli Foreign Minister
" It is regrettable that the Swedish foreign ministry does not intervene when it comes to a blood libel against Jews , " Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman said .
" [ This ] reminds one of Sweden 's conduct during World War II , when it also did not intervene . "
In a blog post on Thursday evening , Sweden 's Foreign Minister Carl Bildt wrote that he would not condemn the article , and that freedom of expression is part of the Swedish constitution .
Mr Bildt added that condemnation of anti-Semitism is " the only issue on which there has ever been complete unity in the Swedish parliament " .
The story in Aftonbladet - Sweden 's biggest - selling daily newspaper - claimed that Israeli soldiers snatched Palestinian youths and returned their dismembered bodies a few days later .
The newspaper claimed that these incidents date as far back as 1992 .
The Israeli press is reporting that the country 's foreign ministry is considering its options in response to Sweden 's position , among them postponing a scheduled visit to Israel by Mr Bildt .
The Swedish foreign minister is due to travel to the country in 10 days .
The nomadic pastoralists who live in the arid scrubland on the Kenya - Somalia border are being forced out of their traditional way of living by a succession of worsening droughts .

CANNABIS CULTURE – On June 8 , Canada ’s Parliament passed a new set of mandatory minimum penalties for a variety of marijuana and drug offences .
CLICK HERE to help stop Bill C - 15 !
The new law now goes to the Senate , where it will likely be approved .
Even though Canada ’s Senate has many members who oppose prohibition , it is extremely rare for the Senate to block a bill passed by Parliament , especially when it has the support of both Liberals and Conservatives .
According to Conservative Justice Minister Rob Nicholson , the law is aimed at “ serious drug traffickers , the people who are basically out to destroy our society . ”
NDP & BLOC QUEBECOIS OPPOSE NEW LAW
“ This bill is clearly targeted at the low - level dealers , ” said Libby Davies , NDP House Leader .
“ It is simply really bad public policy .
It is going to increase the prison population , particularly the provincial prison population , because most of these mandatory sentences that are two years or less will be under the provincial jurisdiction . ”
Davies explained how the Liberals teamed with the Conservatives to stop the bill from being amended .
“ In committee , the NDP put forward 21 amendments that tried to remove some of the worst aspects of the bill , by changing the regime of mandatory minimums , for example , and getting an exemption for medical marijuana for compassion clubs . ”
“ I am so disappointed that those amendments did not go through , ” continued Davies .
“ The Liberal members on the committee failed to respond to those amendments and failed to support them , which really surprises me . ”
LIBERAL REVOLT ?
A number of prominent Liberals are challenging their party ’s support for this bill .
Dozens of bloggers , riding association presidents and other party members have publicly complained about Liberal Leader Michael Ignatieff pressuring the party to back the new law .
Yet when it came to the vote , every Liberal present voted for the bill , except for Liberal MP Keith Martin , who supports decriminalization .
Martin abstained from the vote .
The NDP and Bloc all voted against it .
“ In the context of some occasions where the sentences have not been appropriate , we ’re in support of C - 15 , ” said Ignatieff .
“ We support stronger measures . ”
SOME HIGHLIGHTS OF THE NEW LAW
SCHEDULE ONE EXPANDED
Schedule I , which already included substances like opiates and cocaine , is expanded to include methamphetamine and GHB .
MINIMUMS FOR MAKING HASH AND GROWING POT
The following minimum penalties will only apply when the hash - making or pot - growing is being done “ for trafficking purposes . ”
However , under the law , trafficking includes sharing with friends .
So unless you can prove that you were going to use every last gram all by yourself , it will be considered trafficking .
Making hash : 1 year mandatory minimum
Growing 5-200 cannabis plants : 6 months
Growing 201-500 plants : 1 year
Growing 501 or more plants : 2 years
If you live in a rental home , or if there are children in the grow home , or if the judge just deems your garden to be a “ potential public safety hazard , ” then the minimum penalties are lengthened as follows :
Making hash : 18 months
5-200 plants : 9 months
210-500 plants : 18 moths
501 + plants : 3 years
MINIMUMS FOR MAKING OPIUM OR GROWING POPPIES
Producing any amount of a Schedule I substance gets a mandatory minimum of two years .
( This includes growing opium poppies and coca plants . )
MINIMUMS FOR SELLING
If a person in jail is caught selling or sharing any Schedule I substance , they get an automatic 2 years added to their sentence .
Anyone caught selling or sharing a Schedule I substance on or near a school grounds would get a 2 year mandatory minimum sentence .
This would include a student selling or sharing with another student .
Selling any Schedule I substance “ near any public place usually frequented by people under the age of 18 ” gets a 2 year mandatory sentence .
No definition of “ near ” is given , neither is it defined what exactly is meant by “ a public place frequented by people under the age of 18 . ”
This vague law could easily cover most of the city and catch many people unawares .
Once again , this applies to a youth who shares or sells to another youth .
A second conviction for trafficking in over 3 kilos of marijuana or hash within a ten - year period will get a mandatory 1 year sentence .
MINIMUMS FOR IMPORTING AND EXPORTING
Get caught mailing a few grams across the border ?
Exporting or importing any amount of marijuana gets a mandatory 1 year in jail .
Exporting or importing up to a a kilo of coca leaf , cocaine , opium or heroin gets a year mandatory imprisonment .
Over a kilo gets an automatic 2 years in jail .
EXCERPTS FROM THE TESTIMONY OF MS SARAH INNESS , SPEAKING ON BEHALF OF THE CANADIAN BAR ASSOCIATION
At the outset , I wish to state that the CBA opposes the use of mandatory minimum sentences on the basis that they do not advance the goals of deterrence ; they do not target the most serious of offenders , who are already sentenced stiffly ; they catch less culpable offenders , subjecting them to lengthy terms of imprisonment ; they have a disproportionate impact on those minority groups who are already disadvantaged ; and they subvert important aspects of the sentencing regime , including the principles of proportionality and the individualization of the sentencing process .
For example , a young adult occasional user of marijuana who is growing ten plants for his own use and to share with some friends attracts an MMS of six months .
We would say that this sentence violates the principle of proportionality and the importance of rehabilitation .
A person making a small amount of cannabis resin for use and to share with friends would be subject to an MMS of one year and to 18 months if he did so in a house that he was renting .
The legislation apparently fails to address a situation in which the third party owner of the property is aware of and complicit in the use of the property for the offence .
Bill C - 15 also imposes escalating levels of incarceration depending upon the number of plants an individual grows for trafficking .
For instance , this bill would require an MMS of six months for 200 plants , yet twelve months for 201 plants .
It is contrary to common sense and well - established sentencing principles for a person to receive double the length of a sentence for a difference of one plant .
We believe the impact upon the administration of justice of this bill , if it is passed , will be significant .
Fewer people will plead guilty , preferring to contest the charges rather than be subject to an automatic mandatory minimum sentence upon pleading guilty .
This will increase the length of time it takes for cases to be heard in the courts , increase the number of trials , and inevitably increase the strain on court resources .
Given the significant prison terms proposed within Bill C - 15 , the crown should be required to prove beyond a reasonable doubt the aggravating factors triggering an MMS as well as the mens rea component of those aggravating factors ; for example , the requisite degree of awareness of the number of plants , or the fact that the offence was being committed at or near a school or at a place usually frequented by those under the age of 18 .
We point out the lack of a definition with respect to “ in or near a school ” , or places “ usually frequented ” by those under 18 .
We make the point that the crown ought to be required to prove not only the mens rea of the offence itself but also that with respect to the aggravating factor that would trigger a mandatory minimum sentence .

Like for Halloween and Christmas , the sales pitches arrive well before the actual event .
Television , radio , newspapers , piles of merchandise in stores you visit , and blogs all announce : Back to School !
For some it ’s kindergarten , for others , the very first day of college .
School is starting soon .
And that may mean losing your religion .
And no , not the R.E.M. song .
Nor , indeed , most of the definitions of the phrase out there — losing your temper , giving up civility , or flying off the handle , for example — though some people do see loss of religion and loss of morality or civility as entangled .
What do I mean ?
I mean losing your religion in a not - so - subtle way .
I mean secularizing ; closer to what the founders of losingmyreligion.com mean than , say , R.E.M. ( what was Michael Stipe really singing about anyway ? )
And , this sort of fear of lost faith may be the reason that a recent study from the University of Michigan has elicited such attention across various news media .
Can your choice of college major mean … losing your religion ?
For many of those heading off to college , choosing a major is a critical step along the way to graduation .
At some point , “ undecided ” is not enough ; decisions are called for , choices , declaration of major forms .
This whole process is sometimes thought of as peculiar to higher education in the United States , which is unlike other systems where college or university students know their area of specialization well before heading off to university .
For US students , declaring a major is a ritual almost as recognizably undergraduate as , say joining a fraternity , supporting sports teams or , these days , engaging in community service even when not forced to do so by the legal system .
Indeed , there are books on choosing your major , Web sites filled with advice , and even quizzes to take online to figure out what major would be best for you .
Postmodernism as Gateway Drug to Atheism
And , now , there has been an explosion of reporting on choice of college major — and religiosity — in the higher education press and the blogosphere .
Both the Chronicle of Higher Education and Inside Higher Education reported on the ways this ritualized choice may ( or may not ) relate to losing one ’s religion .
In an article entitled “ Connecting College Majors and Religion , ” Becky Supiano of the Chronicle drew on a paper entitled “ Empirics on the Origins of Preferences : The Case of College Major and Religiosity , ” published by the National Bureau of Economic Research .
Paper authors Miles Kimball , Colter M. Mitchell , Arland D. Thornton , and Linda C. Young - Demarco ( all of the University of Michigan ) investigated both the impact of major on religiosity and vice versa : the impact of religiosity on major .
When Inside Higher Education took up the topic , their writers ( or at least their headline writers ) made the rhetorical leap from “ religiosity ” to “ God . ”
Beyond the higher education press , the blogosphere erupted with responses ranging from simple re-postings to a response entitled “ atheism is freedom . ”
Not to be left out , the more traditional news media in the United States and beyond took up the topic as well ; from Texas to India and back to New Hampshire , the notion that college major and religiosity are linked seemed to require attention .
A lot of attention .
Of course , all this probably resulted from the well - executed press release issued by the University of Michigan , where the co-authors work .
Here ’s how the press release opened :
College students who major in the social sciences and humanities are likely to become less religious , while those majoring in education are likely to become more religious .
But students majoring in biology and physical sciences remain just about as religious as they were when they started college .
Of course , the article itself is not really about a causal link between either religiosity and choice of major or the impact of college major on religiosity .
The article is about a set of correlations , developed through a study of 26,200 people and , as one odd assumption , the choice of business as a “ culturally neutral ” major .
Despite this , some fearmongering headlines announced , for example , that the humanities lead to loss of religion .
In articulating the reasons for the decline of religiosity among various majors , the authors identify several culprits : science , “ developmentalism ” ( by which they mean a belief in progress ) , and postmodernism ( by which they mean a belief that everything is relative ) .
As quoted in the press release , Miles Kimball says :
Our results suggest that it is Postmodernism , not science , that is the bête noir of religiosity .
One reason may be that the key ideas of Postmodernism are newer than the key scientific ideas that challenge religion .
For example , religions have had 150 years to develop resistance or tolerance for the late - 19th century idea of Evolution , but much less time to develop resistance or tolerance for the key ideas of Postmodernism , which gained great strength over the course of the 20th century .
Funded by the John Templeton Foundation , this work stands over against , for example , the notion that college is good for faith ( see here ) or points to the central importance of the religious engagement of American undergraduates ( see a study funded in part by Teagle ) .
Such efforts to examine the relation of particular disciplines to religiosity also link , perhaps , to various studies of faculty and faith which examine both correlations and possible causal relations ( see here or here ) .
Religious Leaders of the Future ?
Why do we care ?
Depending , of course , on your stance , religion can be seen as a potential savior of American society ( not to mention individuals ) .
In this regard , the Heritage Foundation has been adamant that religion is of critical importance to sustaining social stability .
Others note that the spiritual lives of American undergraduates are both important to them ( perhaps increasingly so ) , and nurturing that spirituality critical to higher education ’s public responsibility .
( See AACU 2005 report here . )
UCLA ’s HERI Institute has reported , too , that there is a positive relationship between students ’ spirituality and achievement .
Still others , including those who commented on a recent description of this study at the Friendly Atheist site think all this important because , hey , atheism is a good thing and college majors may be a way to increase atheist demographics .
For all of these folks , whether you are a helicopter parent or not , a college student about to declare a major or not , it matters how education and religion are related — it matters for our future .
Today ’s undergraduates are , almost every higher education institution claims , tomorrow ’s leaders .
As UCLA ’s HERI has noted , political engagement among first - year college students has hit a 40 - year high .
So : do we , or do we not , want religious leaders ?
If so , what sort of religious leaders ?
Turns out , college major ( may ) matter .
Remember that … because it ’s Back to School !
A giant fingerprint on Mars : High res camera reveals details just 3ft across on Red Planet

This striking range of dunes and craters appears to form a giant cosmic fingerprint on the surface of the Red Planet .
Scientists believe the undulating ground reveals global climate changes that took place on Mars over the past few million years .
The area is in the Coprates region , a large trough that forms part of the Valles Marineris - a system of canyons stretching thousands of miles along Mars ' equator .
The whitish areas could be evaporites - mineral sediments left behind when salt water evaporates .
Such deposits would be of great interest as they indicate potential habitats for past martian life .

The giant fingerprint - like shape was created by possible evaporites - sediments formed by the evaporation of water
Good gully : A close up shot of gullies at the edge of the Hale Crater on the Red Planet .
It covers an area 0.6 miles across
The detailed image is just one of thousands of pictures recently unveiled taken by Nasa 's Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter .
The images were collected using a High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment ( HiRISE ) camera during more than 1,500 telescopic observations .
Each full image from HiRISE , taken between April and August last year , covers a strip of Martian ground six kilometers ( 3.7 miles ) wide , showing details as small as one metre , or yard , across .
They are the most detailed pictures of the Red Planet 's surface taken from space .
The Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter has been studying Mars with an advanced set of instruments since 2006 .
It has returned more data about the planet than all other past and current missions to Mars combined .
In another dramatic red image several gullies can be seen carved into hill - slopes and the walls of impact craters .
You can see wide V - shaped channels running downhill ( from top to bottom ) where the material that carved the gully flowed .
At the bottom of the channel this material empties out onto a fan - shaped mound .
On Earth these features usually form through the movement of liquid water , long thought to be absent on Mars .
Planetary scientists are examining the gullies to see if they change and work out whether they form under today 's cold dry conditions .
Mars is also subject to huge tectonic forces .
One image , that shows a dark crocodile shaped patch on the surface , is from a deep trough known as the Ulysses Fossae .
These types of troughs form when the crust is stretched until it breaks , often due to the large weight of nearby volcanos .
It lies in the Tharsis quadrangle , which also has some of Mars ' greatest volcanoes including Olympus Mons .
At 16.7 miles high Olympus is three times the height of Mount Everest .
The orbiter is managed by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory , Pasadena , California for NASA 's Science Mission Directorate , Washington .
The High Resolution Imaging Science Experiment is operated by the University of Arizona , Tucson .
They will be used to investigate the safety of potential future landing sights for the Mars Science Laboratory , which is due to launch from Earth in 2011 .
The rover will assess whether Mars was , or is still today , an environment able to support microbial life .
It will carry the biggest , most advanced suite of instruments for scientific studies ever sent to the martian surface .

ISL6259 Chip and Apple MacBook Battery Charging and Power Problems 2018-02-03T15:54:54+05:30 2018-02-03T15:54:54+05:30 admin
Is your Apple Mac Not Charging or Not Turning On ?
The ISL6259 Chip is one of the most complex and challenging logic board components to replace .
Although it is quite cheap to repair , it plays a very important role in your MacBook power system .
So , what exactly does this tiny chip do ?
Before we get to that , I need to take you through a couple of things first .
Every command or communication transmitted through your computer passes through a data line .
Data lines are circuits that carry data within your Apple Mac or any communications channel within computer microchips .
Now , let ’s say you turn on your PC , it works on perfectly on the charger , but when you look at the charger light , there ’s no green light .
This is a very widespread issue among computer users worldwide .
What causes it ?
When your MacBook power system starts acting up , the most likely culprit is usually the one wire circuit problem .
So how does the isL6259 Chip come into play ?
In a computer board , the SMC , charger , VCC , pull up resistor and the ISL6259 Chip are all connected and communicate via a data line commonly referred to as a one wire circuit .
At the very end is a logic gate that lets in voltage to power the isL6259 Chip , which in turn creates a data line for the purposes of communicating with your charger and SMC .
All these multiple components need to work properly for the charging system to work like it should .
However , a failed power or charging system could be brought about by any of a thousand factors .
How on earth are we supposed to troubleshoot over 5000 little components on one system ?
The ISL6259 Chip and Its Use in Troubleshooting MacBook Power Problems
Using the ISL6259 Chip is one of the quickest ways to troubleshoot any power issues with your MacBook .
You ’ll need an oscilloscope to check where the power voltage gets disrupted and eliminate any components that seem to be working .
Typically , you want a complete SMC / BC / ACLK connection all the way to the pull - up resistor to open the logic gate .
By looking at the data lines and power lines around the charging chip and adapter , you are highly likely to find something wrong with the ISL6259 chip itself .
Your oscilloscope should show around 4
Volts through the resistor to the charger AC since their usually not the problem 99 % of the time .
A damaged ISL6259 Chip will not complete the circuit , often leading to migraine - inducing charging problems .
Before you go all nuts and destroy your MacBook motherboard or blame it on a faulty charger , make sure you take it to a certified computer repair centre for diagnostics , repair , and even replacement .
It might end up saving you the trouble as well as some precious coins too !
