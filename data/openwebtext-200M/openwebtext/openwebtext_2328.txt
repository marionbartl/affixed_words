A short time ago , I submitted an article about how Chinese oil interests have been able to secure the first concession for Iraqi oil .
The outlook for similar deals is good , if you are Chinese or Russian , or indeed anything except a U.S. oil executive or what are arguably the two most criminally incompetent individuals to come to light in the last fifty years .
The administration of George W. Bush and his petrodog running mate Dick Cheney came into office as a result of a fraud perpetrated on the American People by neo-conservative ideologues and the corporate interests that hold their leash .
It was all the opening they needed .
Two frauds , one , a sociopath and liar , who never earned success at any time in his life , and the other sitting on a career made of disparaging government as he clung to its teat to enrich and empower himself and his cronies .
Between them , they determined to perpetrate an even greater fraud to enrich their oil industry cronies by throwing the United States into the increasingly violent competition for world petroleum supplies .
Early on they started the campaign of lies that was to serve as the basis for the terror that they would impose .
Unconcerned with events in Afghanistan or concerning al - Queda , Cheney conducted the meetings to “ formulate energy policy ” which were basically the laying of plans for the division of first Iraq ’s then Iran ’s mineral wealth among the cronies .
Does anyone still wonder why conservationists were not invited to these “ energy policy ” advisory meetings ?
Then came the trauma of September 11 , 2001 .
This was their pretext , whether what appeared to neo-cons as a serendipitous occurrence or whether they actively participated in its execution , they seized it and used it .
From the very outset , in the face of incontrovertible evidence of al - Queda ’s responsibility they implicated Target One , Saddam Hussein ’s Iraq .
This despite common knowledge that Hussein , whatever his numerous and severe shortcomings , would have no tolerance of , let alone involvement with , al - Queda .
The event was followed by a thoroughly orchestrated propaganda campaign accusing Iraq of developing weapons of mass destruction , suggesting that they were nearly ready to target the United States with an attack that would cause the events of September 11 , 2001 pale to insignificance by comparison .
They indicted Iraq , Iran and North Korea as the “ Axis of Evil ” , and bullied and cajoled the U.N. ( for which they have little other use ) to pass resolutions whose enforcement could be the excuse for initiating military action .
Then , by April 2003 , they struck .
Iraq was invaded .
In the face of such overwhelming military might , the Iraqi government and army could do nothing other than melt away into the general population .
The power vacuum left behind created anarchy .
Crime and looting were rampant .
Treasures of Iraq ’s archeological and artistic patrimony were disappearing at an astonishing rate
What did the occupying army choose to enforce ?
They occupied the Oil Ministry and secured the records .
They did not start searching for weapons of mass destruction until after the Oil Ministry was secured .
They did not even bother to secure the considerable Iraqi weapons caches that were scattered to sites around the country until after the Oil Ministry was secured , and by then it was too late .
To silence any potentially uncooperative members of the corporate press , they offered to “ imbed ” reporters with the troops , secure in the knowledge that the worst place to get an overview of a war that might conflict with the Brass ’ propaganda is right up front with the grunts .
That is where tactics are on display and strategy is invisible .
After the end of the war and beginning of the occupation democracy was introduced to Iraq .
To their credit , the people of Iraq embraced it enthusiastically for the most part , though while their choices were many , as they are in a parliamentary system , the information that they received with Iraqi origins was carefully controlled by U.S. interests who paid to have the stories that they wanted put into the press .
In fairness , those with satellite availability could consult al - Jazeera or other Arab language sources .
The Iraqi occupation continues to the present .
The casualties continue .
The metrics for success of the “ surge ” in troop levels are not fulfilled .
After a steadily and quickly evolving litany of excuses for why we had to go there in the first place , it is apparent to even casual observers that the real reason is and has always been that we went to gain hegemony over the petroleum reserves .
According to Antiwar.com , four thousand one hundred fifty six American military personnel have lost their lives , though that count is no doubt higher since the Bush administration fudges and lies about even those numbers .
The official count of American wounded is 30 , 634 , but estimates of the true number run as high as over 100,000 .
Estimating Iraqi dead from this conflict is a nebulous exercise at best , but Antiwar.com tracks several sources , and they place the number at a ghastly 1.2 million .
The U.S. citizen on the home front has spent these past five and a half years being encouraged to go shopping for the goods that are n’t much produced here any more , while their government discharges nearly $ 15,000.000.00 every hour , twenty - four hours per day , seven days a week , into the corrupt ether that is crony corporate no bid contracting and misspent , misdirected foreign aid .
Then a Chinese company gets the first development contract for Iraqi oil fields .
There is noise from the Iraqi parliament that they prefer to award these contracts to Asian companies , and rumors that Iran is pressuring their Shiite brothers in the Iraqi government to shun American companies .
Not that the United States stood to benefit from these supplies at all .
Oil is fungible , and whatever U.S. Big Oil withdrew from those fields would go to the closest bourse for transshipment to the highest bidder .
That is what they do with the oil that they extract within the United States .
Why would we believe that anything else is possible for Iraqi oil ?
You may rely , however , on an expectation that we will continue to expend blood and treasure at this same dizzying rate to ensure the security of those others around the world who will profit from Iraqi oil .
So , at last we arrive at the final abysmal failure of the incompetents who could do nothing else .
Failure and ruin in the pursuit of criminal riches has been the hallmark of their lives , and here they arrive at its nadir .

Along with a rapid military victory in Georgia , Vladimir Putin succeeded with another weapon in Russia 's effort to divide and conquer Europe : energy .
Despite claims of unity on the crisis in the Caucasus , energy is a clear dividing line on the Continent .
Countries that have long - term gas partnerships with Russia -- primarily the West Europeans -- chose the " both sides are to blame " approach to the war in Georgia .

Schools & Lower Taxes Make Nocatee & Ponte Vedra Homes Popular
When home shoppers visit Northeast Florida or the " First Coast " due to their relocation many will start in Northeast St. Johns County due to the award winning school system ( some of the best in the state ) and lower property taxes for real estate .
In particular , Ponte Vedra Beach ( zip code 32082 ) is a popular destination for home shoppers .
In that it is so close to the beach in one of the highest per capita income area of the state and Nocatee ( zip code for 32081 ) for getting new construction homes .
But that does n't mean we do n't have plenty of other wonderful and beautiful areas to check out .
I am a life long resident of this area and a full time real estate broker for over 20 years .
So I have been all over these areas and I am happy to share my opinion and answer any questions you may have .

Want a Gated Community , Golf Course or Beach Home ?
Try Jacksonville , Jacksonville Beach , Atlantic Beach , Nocatee & Ponte Vedra Beach
If a manicured area full of planned , gated golf subdivisions is what you are looking for then you definitely need to make sure you visit Ponte Vedra Beach .
We have many different types and sizes of homes and condos to choose from .
It 's only 5 miles length of the Atlantic Ocean and approximately 30,000 people in population ; yet it is home to the annual Player 's Championship Golf Tournament at Sawgrass Players Club and host the headquarters of not just the PGA Tour but also the ATP tour .
In this area you have plenty of golf course communities to choose from .
In fact there are more than 150 holes of golf in the area and 60 tennis courts .
These include Marsh Landing , Sawgrass Country Club and The Plantation at Ponte Vedra .
Some of the most expensive real estate in Northeast Florida is found on the ocean .
However , there are only a few oceanfront condo complexes in Ponte Vedra Beach , so you should also check out Jacksonville Beach where we had a condo construction boom if that is what you are looking for .
Other Jacksonville Metro Areas
Duval County Neighborhoods
The Southside area has the highest population density in all of Jacksonville .
This area is more like a downtown area of another city without the high rises .
In fact , you are as likely to find your corporate office located in this area instead of downtown .
So not only do you have plenty of housing options including condos , townhomes , gated communities and golf course communities .
But you also have a short commute with your office located right here plus a huge selection of restaurants , shopping , grocery stores , banks , nightlife and entertainment .
Deerwood and Deercreek are two popular gated , golf subdivsions in this area you should check out .
Located just to the east of Southside is area known as the Intracoastal West .
You are still minutes to the Southside area with the work and play options but you are also just minutes to the beach .
In this area are plenty of housing options including homes with access to the Intracoastal Waterway like Queens Harbour , new construction communities like Tamaya , high end custom built homes like the gated community of Pablo Creek Reserve and golf course communities of Glen Kernan and Jacksonville Golf & CC .
It can be confusing with so many beaches in a small 20 mile stretch of the Atlantic ocean .
A quick visit and chat can help you determine if you are looking for the country club feel of Ponte Vedra Beach , the upscale bohemian feel of Atlantic Beach or something in - between .
For example , if walk to beach location and affordibility is key to you then Atlantic Beach is one of the most popular choices in Duval County .
It is one the few locations in Jacksonville where you have a city center with restaurants , shops , boutiques and nightlife within walking distance of homes .
But if you are looking for an oceanfront condo , especially a larger and newer luxury condo , then Jacksonville Beach should be your focus .
Jacksonville Beach has been renovated their city center area and they are not far behind Atlantic Beach .
Give me a call so we can discuss the Beaches .
If you do n't want to blow your budget and want to stay in the St. Johns County School system then there are plenty of real estate options in Northwest St. Johns County .
You can choose from popular golf course communities like Julington Creek Plantation , Cimarrone Golf & CC , South Hampton , St. Johns Golf & CC or the famous World Golf Village .
In addition , there are plenty of gated communities full of beautiful homes and even new construction homes for sale in Aberdeen and Durbin Crossing .
Some of the best water fun you can have can be found on Julington Creek or along the St. Johns River in this area .
This is a very large area and you can spend days seeing the different communities with every type of housing there is .
Please give us a call to help you narrow down the best communities for you .
I sit down and have a chat with hip - hop legend KRS - One on 9/12/2008 during SMT Studios ' Now or Never 2008 benefit concert for dying September 11th first responders .
KRS discusses the plight of the rescue workers , what happened on 9/11 , and his attitude towards Hip - Hop and social consciousness .
The interview ends somewhat abruptly , as my tape ran out .
When I turned around , there were about 4 or 5 other cameras behind me filming , so I 'm sure you can find the rest of this somewhere online if you look .
So lately , I ’ve been thinking a lot about this guy :
That probably does n’t come as much of a surprise to anybody , given the amount of time I spend thinking about Batman in general , but since seeing The Dark Knight , I ’ve been trying to figure out why the Joker has become the kind of character that he is .
Looking at the character today , it ’s obvious that he ’s not only Batman ’s arch - nemesis , but that more than any other villain , he ’s evolved alongside his opposite number to become something more .
In a review of Dark Knight , Ken pointed out that comics–especially DC–are built around archetypes .
Superman , for instance , is n’t just a good man with super - powers , he ’s a symbol of everything that ’s good and selfless with a face and a logo on his chest , and as much as Batman ’s come to symbolize the relentless , single - minded pursuit of justice , the Joker ’s done the same , becoming chaos itself .
As Ken says , he does n’t believe in chaos , he is chaos .
He ’s less a criminal and more a force of nature .
The question I ’ve been mulling over , then , is why it ’s the Joker and not someone else .
I do n’t think I ’m really advancing an unpopular opinion when I say that Batman has the best villains in comics , but even among a crowd that strong , the Joker stands out .
The best villains , after all , are the ones that bring out the contrasts within the hero himself , and that ’s something Batman has to spare .
The Scarecrow , for instance , does to civilians what Batman does to the superstitious , cowardly lot of criminals .
Two - Face has the same split - personality as Batman and Bruce Wayne , but with a mask that he ca n’t take off .
Even Ra ’s al - Ghul , who was introduced to give Batman a classic pulp - style villain that would allow for world travel and set pieces , is a powerful , obsessive intellectual prone to uncontrollable rages who has set himself outside the law and devoted his life to wiping out what he sees as evil at any cost , to the point where he seeks out a man with the same sort of drive to carry on his life ’s work .
But even those characters fall short of the gold standard : Scarecrow ’s archenemy may be Batman , but Batman ’s archenemy is the Joker .
At its heart , you can trace it to the fact that the Joker takes what is literally the opposite route :
From his first appearance in 1940 , he ’s everything Batman ’s not in every way but one .
Whereas that Batman of the 1940s is a dour , grim avenger in black and grey who works in secret and things like “ a fitting end for his kind ” when he “ accidentally ” kicks a dude into a vat of chemicals , the Joker ’s loud and garish enough to broadcast his intentions over the airwaves , and while Golden Age Batman was a lot more prone to witty fight banter , the Joker ’s alarmingly direct :
From the start , he ’s an amazing visual , and it ’s a complete inversion of the classic hero and villain formula .
Batman was inspired as much by Count Dracula and the Shadow as he was heroes like Zorro , with a costume designed to frighten , but he ’s still the good guy .
The one in the bright colors with the big smile who does magic tricks … that ’s the one you need to watch out for .
By the Silver Age , though , things have changed , largely due to the tonal shift that resulted from the Comics Code , and without the edge of madness and outright shrieks of “ I ’m going to kill you , ” the Joker loses a lot of his villainous mojo and fades back to be just another visually interesting face in the crowd .
For evidence , you do n’t need to look any further than the 1966 TV show .
For all the fan grousing about how its campiness detracted from the legitimate storytelling of the comics–and the eye - rolling that goes with the fact that it ’s been forty - two years and we still ca n’t get a headline about comics without “ Biff ! Pow ! ” or “ Holy Lazy Copywriters , Batman ! ” – anyone who ’s actually ever read Silver Age Batman stories can tell you that the show reflected the goofiness of the comics , not the other way around .
In any case , as entertaining as Cesar Romero ’s Joker is–and brother , he is entertaining –he ’s just another thematic villain for Batman to deal with that week .
Swap out the playing cards and clown puns for birds , Egyptian artifacts , dinosaur eggs or cat statues , and the stories could ’ve been about anybody in the cast .
There ’s not a whole lot that ’s distinctive about him–when you stack him up against the rest of the arch - criminals , anyway–and aside from the visual aspects , there ’s almost nothing in the character that we ’d recognize as the Joker of today .
There is , however , a lot that we ’d recognize as today ’s Joker on the show itself , it just does n’t come from the Joker ; it comes from the Riddler .
It all comes down to Frank Gorshin , who just played the hell out of the role , snapping back and forth from manic glee to genuinely chilling obsession several times in every scene at a pace that would mirror the Joker ’s portrayal in Batman :
The Animated Series–which also reinvented the Riddler as a far more smug , intellectual villain–twenty - five years later .
But as for the Joker , well …
Cesar Romero ’s great and I would n’t trade his Joker for the world , but there ’s a reason the series led with the guy in green .
By the mid-80s , though , everything had changed again .
Instead of the guy who carried out clown - themed robberies and pulled boners , there was a character that was firmly entrenched as Batman ’s arch - enemy .
This was the Joker in full end - boss mode , the Final Form of the Clown Prince of Crime that shot and paralyzed Barbara Gordon and gleefully beat Robin to death with a crowbar .
This is the guy who pushes Batman to his limit in Dark Knight Returns and snaps his own neck after a triple - digit murder spree , just to make everyone think Batman ’s finally lost it .
This , my friends … this is an arch - nemesis .
But those are n’t what make him the go - to bad guy ; the Joker ’s a part of all those stories because he ’s already Batman ’s arch - enemy .
Even in the finale of Batman Year One – the Alpha to DKR ‘s Omega–the Joker ’s used as shorthand for the new type of criminal that ’s going to be rising to challenge Batman .
He ’s the escalation , the one that ca n’t be intimidated by Batman ’s physicality or figured out by his deductions or scared by his demonic costume .
The scene works not just because we know what the Joker card means when Gordon hands it to Batman , but because we know that the Joker is the one you have to worry about .
Clearly , this is the “ real ” Joker and not the watered down version , which leads to the question of what changed ?
Was it just a slow build that returned the Joker to his roots , a combination of his lasting visual appeal and the further refining of Batman as the ultra- competent super - detective adventurer that he evolved into ?
Maybe , but I ’m of the opinion that there has to be a turning point somewhere .
After all , most of the great villains of comics have the moment where you know that Everything Changes .
Dr. Doom , for instance , starts out as a visually interesting character with an awesome name , but until he steals the Power Cosmic and becomes DOCTOR DOOM , he ’s just a cool - looking guy that once sent the Fantastic Four back in time to look for pirate treasure .
The Green Goblin was a legitimate threat with an interesting hook and some good stories under his belt , but he was n’t the Spider - Man villain until he chucked Peter Parker ’s girlfriend off a bridge .
Even Lex Luthor , who was an ever - present arch - nemesis for Superman , did n’t really reach his full potential until we saw how far he was willing to damn himself for revenge in –of all things–an imaginary story .
With the Joker , it ’s a little harder to pin down .
Like Luthor , he ’s almost omnipresent , the strength of the earlier stories , the visual contrast and the prominence of his character on the TV show pushing him to the forefront for most of the character ’s life .
But given the timeframe we ’re working with , I ’d have to say that it really comes down to two stories from the ’ 70s that put him over the top .
The first , of course , is the Denny O’Neil / Neal Adams classic “ The Joker ’s Five - Way Revenge “ , from 1973 ’s Batman # 251 .
To be honest , this one almost gets a pass solely based on it being one of the most beautiful things Neal Adams ever drew , but at its heart , it ’s more of an archetypal story of Batman than the Joker .
It does , after all , have pretty much everything you want to see from Batman :
The casual way he takes a thug ’s veiled punches and then lays him out in one shot ( a trademark of O’Neil ’s ’ 70s Batman ) , the deduction of where the Joker ’s hiding based off the dirt on his shoes , he fights a shark , and of course … well , just look at this thing :
Absolutely gorgeous .
Of course , it is a Joker story , and O’Neil did a lot to bring back what was so compelling about the character :
He ’s on a murder spree that ’s ostensibly based on getting revenge against the henchman who sold him out , but beneath the surface , there ’s the idea that for the Joker , it ’s far easier to just kill five people than find out which one ratted him out .
Add to that the fact that he ’s around thirty real - time years into his criminal career at this point and would therefore probably be heading off to jail anyway with or without the evidence of his ex-flunkie , and you ’ve got someone who breezes into town like a thunderstorm and just starts killing because it ’s second nature to him .
Also , O’Neil brings in one of the most important and lasting aspects of the character–His “ game ” against Batman :
There are a few more villains who ’d rather beat Batman than kill him –the Riddler springs to mind–but by refusing to kill him when the opportunity presents itself , as it does more than a couple of times , the Joker sets himself up as Batman ’s equal and adds an even more sinister aspect to his crimes .
The people he murders are less than nothing to him ; it ’s not about them .
It ’s not even about himself , it ’s just about baiting Batman into another confrontation .
The one that really defines the Joker , though , is the Steve Englehart and Marshall Rogers ’
The Laughing Fish / Sign of the Joker from 1978 ’s Detective # 475-476 , which gives us the amazing , iconic image at the top of this post .
Englehart ’s entire run on Batman is a nod to the Golden Age , bringing back what were then all - but - forgotten characters like Hugo Strange and Deadshot and reinventing them to fight a more streamlined Batman .
For the Joker , though –the story that finished out his run on the title–Englehart went back to the character ’s origin story and retold it with the addition of the “ Jokerized ” fish–infected with the “ Joker Venom ” that had been his weapon of choice in 1940 and returned in “ Five Way Revenge , ” brought directly into focus by Rogers :
It ’s a strange addition , but it ’s one that changes the tone of the story completely .
In 1940 ’s “ The Joker , ” the murders are all organized around robberies , but for “ The Laughing Fish , ” the Joker ’s motivation–killing government employees because he can’t copyright the fish he ’s infected –is completely insane .
It ’s a premise so silly that it could be a Daffy Duck plot if it did n’t end with the Joker murdering at will while Batman and the entire Gotham City police force watched helplessly .
It ’s also worth noting that Marshall Rogers did n’t just draw the Joker as a man who smiled all the time , but as a man who could n’t do anything but smile , an influence that he traced back to the 1928 film The Man Who Laughs , which lent its title to another retelling of the first Joker story by Ed Brubaker and Doug Mahnke .
This , according to Rogers , was the central tragedy of the Joker :
Even if he wanted to cry at all the horror he had caused , he was physically incapable of doing anything but laughing at it , a theme that continued into The Killing Joke .
More importantly , though , this is the story that brings the one great similarity between Batman and the Joker to the forefront :
They ’re both amazing planners .
I mentioned before that the Joker ’s the embodiment of chaos , but in this story–and others , including The Dark Knight –the way he spreads anarchy is through meticulous plans and an ability to second - guess and out - think everyone at any turn .
When Batman disguises himself as the second victim , the Joker poisons the man ’s cat , knowing that it ’ll find its master by scent .
He already knows the best - laid plans , and like entropy itself , he ’s always one step ahead of them .
Incidentally , on the animated series , they added aspects of “ Five Way Revenge ” to the episode based on “ The Laughing Fish ” to meet the standard of shark - fighting .
For my money , though , it all comes down to the Laughing Fish .
The way it draws on the Golden Age story to bridge the gap to the Modern Age , the element of mad randomness and anarchy that ’s built on meticulous planning , the fixed grin .
It ’s as close to a turning point for the character as you ’re likely to find .
Of course , three years prior to the story , the Joker was already popular and prominent enough to carry his own solo series , even if it did last a short nine issues , so who knows ?
Steve Sailer makes jokes :
Why is John McCain in Colombia ?
The most reassuring theory I can come up with is that McCain intends to bring back a couple of sixty pound suitcases that the Secret Service will hustle for him through Customs .
And soon Obama 's big lead in campaign finance will have vanished .
And there wo n't be anymore questions about McCain being too old to have the energy for the job as he starts campaigning 96 hours straight .
On the other hand , there are more alarming interpretations , such as that McCain is taking a serious interest in the geopolitical situation in Northern South America -- i.e. , he wants to get us involved in a war there .
Given John McCain 's legendary openness to the press , one might think that someone on the " straight talk express " would want to ask McCain which Latin American states , if any , fall under the scope of his " rogue state rollback " scheme .
Cuba , presumably .
But also Venezuela ?
Bolivia ?

The Chicago Tribune reports that two families the Chicago suburb of Villa Park were threatened with death if they did not immediately remove the Obama / Biden campaign signs from their front lawns .
“ Get the Obama signs off your property–now , ” the letter reads .
“ Failure to obey this order will result in the immediate death of all family members . ”
Both residents said they will not remove their signs , though the man , who had voted Republican for 25 years before switching parties this year , said his wife is worried about letting their 7 - year - old son play alone outside .
What was it about sticking that Genie back into the bottle ?
Oh , right … too late .
: : : : : : : : : :
It ’s not that their logical arguments are slightly more emotional than democratic logical arguments ; they ’re actually purposely avoiding logic altogether .
Emotion is simply far more effective on their base than reason .
Here ’s a quote to this effect from McCain ’s campaign manager :
This election is not about issues .
This election is about a composite view of what people take away from these candidates .
— Rick Davis 1
Ah , and now we see why they ’ve been running such an attack - based campaign .
The actual strategy is to make people distrust Obama rather than talk about the issues .
That ’s a good way to go for them , actually ; if they campaigned on issues they ’d get slaughtered .
Here ’s a good juxtaposition of the two approaches as seen through two hypothetical , in - character stump speeches :
Democrats
The reason you ’re suffering right now is because of failed policies like , a , b , and c. I want to change those in the following ways : x , y , and z .
This will make America more successful than repeating the failed policies we ’ve had .
Here are twelve areas where our policies are better for 99 % of Americans in the country .
Point by point I ’ve laid it out .
If you vote for me you ’ll see how effective this new approach will be .
Please give me your vote in November .
Republicans
Does n’t that guy just give you a bad feeling ?
Every time I see him up there talking about all the things he ’s going to do , with a mass of cheering fans around him , I think , “ Wow , something about this just ai n’t right … ” I ask you not to trust elaborate , well - articulated plans from people with no record of service ; anyone can say anything .
Trust your gut .
Trust the kind of people who have served this country like I have , who love its traditional values , and do n’t want to see it fall into the hands of some slick - talking lawyer with a questionable past and questionable goals .
When election day comes , you know what to do .

How to Appeal to a Mouthbreather
To win an election with non-thinkers you essentially have to flash images in front of them to get them riled up .
Take the decision away from them and hand it to their biases , fears , and prejudices .
9/11
Twin Towers
White family hugging a white baby
McCain saluting the American flag ( highlighting his war injury )
Terror camp
Bin Laden
Barrack smiling next to an attractive blonde who is also smiling
A mushroom cloud
A weeping mother seeing off a soldier
McCain in the POW camp
Palin taking her kids to a hockey game
McCain and Palin sitting together in church
Then ask them who they want to vote for :
Some possibly Muslim guy who ’s nothing but a good public speaker ( was n’t Lucifer charismatic too ? ) , or a war hero who loves babies ?
This is a win for Republicans .
The only way to counter this is to directly attack the strategy and the liars themselves .
If Obama ’s campaign continues to try and play the purity game they ’re going to lose in November .
It ’s that simple . :

Parents in their 70s are still helping their children financially
The costs of bringing up a child do not end when they enter adulthood - parents end up spending an average of £ 21,540 on adult children , a survey suggests .
The poll of 1,184 people with children aged 18 and older found 94 % helped them pay for education , housing and cars .
And 55 % admitted to helping their grown - up children with general living costs , according to the YouGov poll .
The survey , carried out for insurers LV , revealed parents gave an average £ 5,602 towards children 's first homes .
Lifetime commitment LV spokesman Nigel Snell said : " Our study shows that parents can no longer expect their children to pay their own way once they have flown the nest .
" More than ever it 's true to say that having children means signing up to a lifetime financial commitment . "
Of those surveyed , 62 % said they helped their adult children because " they need the assistance " , while 17 % said their child had asked them for financial help .
Spending on adult children Average contribution to wedding : £ 3,111 Average contribution to university fees : £ 2,245 per year 42 % of respondents gave children more than £ 1,000 for a first car 64 % contributed more than £ 1,000 towards their children 's savings

However , only 29 % said they had received financial help from their own parents after leaving school .
The poll also found nearly a quarter of parents in their 40s still have children aged over 25 living with them .
Property ladder Nearly half of the over - 70s who responded were still helping their children .
BBC research previously showed one in seven parents with adult children had remortgaged or taken out a loan to help them get on the property ladder .
Other studies have suggested parents contribute between £ 18,000 and £ 24,000 towards homes .
Meanwhile , last month it was revealed an estimated one in 10 students had nominated parents as " agents " to help them secure a university place .

Editor ’s note : Lew Rockwell writes on the LRC Blog about this .
He calls it “ National Socialism ” and says the “ Federal Reserve is printing up $ 80 billion for AIG in return for 80 % ownership .
In other words , the people pay , as usual , to save the power elite ’s bacon . ”
Acting to avert a possible financial crisis worldwide , the U.S. Federal Reserve Board reversed course Tuesday and agreed to an $ 85 billion bailout that would give the U.S. government an ownership stake in the troubled insurance giant American International Group .
The decision , announced by the Fed only two weeks after the Treasury Department took over the quasi - government mortgage finance companies Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , is the most radical intervention in private business in the central bank ’s history .
With time running out after AIG failed to get a bank loan to avoid bankruptcy , Treasury Secterary Henry Paulson Jr. and the Fed chairman , Ben Bernanke convened a meeting with House and Senate leaders on Capitol Hill at about 6:30 p.m. Tuesday to explain the rescue plan .
They emerged just after 7:30 p.m. with Paulson and Bernanke looking grim but top lawmakers generally expressing support for the plan .
But the bailout is likely to prove controversial , because it effectively puts taxpayer money at risk while protecting bad investments made by AIG and other institutions does business with .
What frightened Fed and Treasury officials was not simply the prospect of another giant corporate bankruptcy , but AIG ’s its role as an enormous provider of financial insurance , which effectively requires it cover losses suffered by other institutions in the instance of defaults of securities that they have purchased .
That means AIG is potentially on the hook for securities that were once considered safe .

Composite image by POLITICO Palin hit hard on the Sunday shows
Palin-mania continued to dominate the conversation on the Sunday morning talk shows , as Democrats slammed Republican vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin for distorting her record in ads and on the campaign trail .
The attacks came in the midst of a difficult weekend for John McCain , the Arizona senator and GOP presidential nominee .
After a week of putting Democratic rival Barack Obama on the defensive , McCain ’s supporters found themselves defending the veracity of claims made by the campaign about the new addition to the ticket .

Several scathing media reports accused the McCain campaign of routinely stretching the truth , particularly when it comes to Palin ’s record .
On Saturday , the Obama camp issued a long memo to reporters detailing the how Republicans have “ distorted , distracted , and outright lied to the American people . ”
Sensing a favorable turn in the news cycle , Democrats hit hard on the Sunday morning shows .
“ She does n’t know anything , and she is not ready to be vice president , ” Rep. Debbie Wasserman Schultz ( D - Fla . ) said on CBS ’s " Face The Nation . "
“ Quite honestly , the interview I saw and that Americans saw on Thursday and Friday was similar to when I did n’t read a book in high school and had to read the Cliff ’s Notes and phone in my report , ” Wasserman - Schultz said of Palin ’s interview with ABC ’s Charlie Gibson last week .
“ She ’s Cliff - noted her performance so far . ”
Other surrogates focused on what New Mexico Gov. Bill Richardson called “ a series of distortions ” on CNN ’s " Late Edition with Wolf Blitzer . "
“ Here ’s the issue with Gov. Palin .
She ’s a governor . …
That ’s good executive experience .
She ’s telegenic .
She ’s smart .
But there are just a lot of distortions about her record that are coming out , ” he said .
Richardson , a one - time candidate for president , attacked Palin for attempting to bolster her foreign policy credentials by claiming she traveled to Iraq in 2007 .
Her visit was actually a brief stop at a border crossing between Iraq and Kuwait .
On CBS , Texas Republican Sen. Kay Bailey Hutchinson defended Palin by pointing out that the last two presidents were governors who entered the White House lacked significant foreign policy experience .
“ So I do n’t think the fact that she has n’t been to the Middle East yet is a factor , ” said Hutchinson .
“ She has shaken up Alaska politics , and she has instincts about reform and ethics that ’s very , very strong . ”
On " Fox News Sunday , " former Alaska Gov. Tony Knowles , a Democrat supporting Obama , and Alaska Lt. Gov. Sean Parnell , a Republican , debated the number of earmarks Palin has requested as governor .
In a Friday interview on ABC's " The View , " McCain said Palin had requested no earmarks .
His campaign later backed away from the claim .
Palin , in fact , requested $ 453 million worth of earmarks as governor .
In her previous position as mayor of Wasilla , she hired a lobbyist to procure $ 27 million for the Anchorage exurb .
“ If you sit through her Cabinet meeting , she ’s driving down the number of earmarks that Alaska is requesting , ” said Parnell .
“ The prior administration asked for 63 earmarks .
It ’s down to 31 this year .
We ’re driving those numbers down and working to bring reform to Alaska .
This is not something you can just turn the switch on overnight and change . ”
Both ABC ’s " This Week with George Stephanopoulos " and CBS ’s " Face the Nation " hosted female supporters of the candidates who fought over Palin ’s record on equal pay for women , abortion rights and early childhood education .
“ Women have been voting on our side of the ticket because they pay attention to the policies that matter , ” Sen. Claire McCaskill ( D - Mo. ) , a longtime Obama backer , said on " Face the Nation . "
“ I ’ll make a prediction that the women of American will vote for Barack Obama by a healthy margin . ”
Carly Fiorina , former CEO of Hewlett - Packard and a McCain supporter , responded that women consider a wider array of issues when casting their vote .
“ This is what the Democratic Party has done for years .
It has tried to hold women hostage by frightening them on issues such as reproductive rights , ” said Fiorina .
Republicans certainly got in a few digs of their own , decrying Obama ’s lack of executive experience and record of voting with in line with his party .
“ I think what we have n't done adequately in this campaign , meaning Republicans , is maybe some of the emphasis on some of these other issues , it should be on the fact that Senator Obama is the most left - wing candidate the Democratic Party has ever had , the most liberal member of the Senate , ” said former New York City Mayor Rudy Giuliani , who ran against McCain in the primaries and now supports him .
Giuliani continued the criticism of Obama 's record as a community organizer he first made during the Republican National Convention , saying , " Sure , community organizers do good work , and some do n't do very good work , just like everybody else .
The question is what kind of work did Barack Obama do , and how effective was it long term ?
A lot of those housing projects failed . "
But for all their criticism , Democrats recognized that Palin poses some real challenges for their party .
Even Sen. Charles Schumer , an often - outspoken New York Democrat , told NBC " Meet the Press " guest host Tom Brokaw that the McCain campaign had done a “ good job of sort of turning around the battleship at the convention . ”
But the campaign ’s new tactics , he added , lower the level of debate in the election .
“ Look , Barack Obama , to his credit , would like the campaign to just be on the big issues , ” said Schumer .
“ But under Karl Rove 's leadership , McCain is doing what Karl Rove does : small bore , nasty , diversionary . ”
On " Fox News Sunday , " Rove , the former Bush adviser , had a response to Democrats slamming his campaign strategy .
“ I demand a royalty every time they mention my name , ” said Rove .
“ Maybe 25 cents per mention , a buck per mention . ”
Rove , though , made some news of his own when he conceded that McCain , in his attack ads , had " gone one step too far , and [ is ] sort of attributing to Obama things that are , you know , beyond the 100 percent truth test . ”

Nope , the MSM has learned nothing from the subprime debacle , stimulus - palooza , and the foreclosure frenzy .
They are still printing sob stories to elicit sympathy for borrowers who do n’t deserve it .
Check this out from the San Francisco Chronicle .
Cue the world ’s smallest violin :
Foreclosed family ’s last goodbye to home Joann Gardner sat forlornly on her living room floor , waiting for the final step in her home ’s foreclosure process .
The lender ’s representative was due any moment to give her “ cash for keys , ” a transaction in which she would deliver her family home vacant in exchange for an incentive payment .
“ I ’m glad it ’s done , ” Gardner said wearily .
“ I just want to sit down and have some Hennessy . ”
Only days earlier , the house had been jammed with boxes and bags holding the worldly goods her family had accumulated during 54 years in the cramped Oakland bungalow .
Now it was entirely empty , the possessions in storage or donated to the Salvation Army .
Gardner ’s elderly parents , both suffering from dementia and other ailments , had moved a week earlier to a local board - and - care home whose cost would be covered by their Social Security and pension checks .
Gardner , who has been her parents ’ full - time care provider for the past 18 months , planned to move in with her boyfriend in Vallejo and look for a job , perhaps something at Costco .
Buried into the article , after all the gnashing of teeth , we find out the nitty - gritty :
Joann ’s parents , Johnnie Gardner , 87 , and Estelle , 88 , bought the two - bedroom in the Sobrante Park neighborhood in 1954 for $ 11,500 .
His salary as an electrician at the Oakland naval shipyard allowed them to make the payments .
But in recent years , Joann and her brother refinanced it several times for increasingly larger amounts .
The final refinance at the end of 2006 left the family owing $ 454,000 .
The monthly payments of $ 3,362 exceeded the household income of $ 3,144 .
What happened to the money from all the refinances ?
Gardner can’t quite say .
Some went to paying off credit cards ; some was eaten up in huge loan fees .
What is clear is that the family has not made a mortgage payment since December 2006 .
What the… ?!?!?!?!
The money was n’t going to her parents ’ health - care expenses .
She did n’t have a job .
“ Some ” went to credit card bills .
“ Some ” was “ eaten up ” by loan fees .
And the rest ?
She ca n’t even cite some other catastrophic cost– or stupid decision like the Extreme Makeover family made — to explain how $ 454,000 was pissed away .
And I ’m supposed to feel my heartstrings tugged ?
All together now : Boo-freaking - hoo .
When Google App Engine was announced , I was pretty excited to be able to run any code at all on Google ’s servers .
I was also intrigued by the promise of having scalable Web apps without having to worry about the infrastructure .
So I went out and built a sample application to learn how to use App Engine .
I even learned some Python , which was great .
Even being able to successfully build the application , I gave up on App Engine .
One reason is that there is too much data lock - in .
It is a vault where you put your data in , but it ’s very difficult to get it all out if you want or need to .
But the most serious issue for me were the frequent messages on the user group about applications being offline for hours because of a few Web requests that App Engine deemed excessive .
Well , for me the only thing that is attractive about App Engine is the promise of reliability and scalability .
But in practice you ca n’t depend on it .
Aral Balkan , one of the biggest App Engine enthusiasts and a great blogger , wrote an article that sums it all in a masterful way , and where he explains why App Engine is only 25 % ready for prime time .
For example :

Not a promising start to an interview but this is hardly a standard interviewee – a flint - eyed gangster sporting a crew - cut and a boiler suit .
His two colleagues glower from behind oversized sunglasses and thick layers of suspicion .
Rippling tattoos snake out of the rolled - up sleeves of Goon No 1 . " Kieusero , " [ fuck off ] he growls before slamming down the shutter of his office garage .
A well - earned reputation for unpredictability and violence keeps journalists away from the Japanese mafia , or yakuza , but a vicious turf battle between two rival gangs in Kyushu , southern Japan , has made them reluctant media fodder .
The two - year war has caused six deaths and two dozen shootings and bombings .
Now , in an act of collective courage that has electrified the fight against organised crime in Japan but divided this city , local people are taking the gangsters to court .
" The yakuza use weapons you might see in the Iraq war : grenades , bombs and guns that can shoot people 500 m away , " says Osamu Kabashima , the lawyer who is representing the 1,500 plaintiffs .
" My clients have had enough .
They want to live in peace , and they 're putting their lives on the line to achieve it for the sake of their children and grandchildren . "

In the most notorious episode in the war , a gangster hopped up on amphetamines walked into a hospital and pumped two bullets into an innocent man mistaken for a rival .
In another , outside here , the head office of the 1,000 - member Dojin - kai gang , in a busy shopping area , a machine - gun ambush sprayed bullets everywhere .
The attacks snapped the patience of locals , who plan to drive them out using a civil law that allows them to challenge businesses that " infringe on their right to live peacefully " .
Win or lose , the legal fight will go down in history , says Japan 's media .
" This is the first time that citizens are trying to expel the head office of a designated gangster organisation , " heralded the liberal Asahi newspaper , which praised the plaintiffs and called on the government to " drive the yakuza into extinction " .
That is unlikely .
Japan 's National Police Agency estimates the country has 86,000 gangsters , many times the strength of the US mafia at its peak .
A single group , the Yamaguchi - gumi , is the General Motors of organised crime , with nearly 40,000 members across Japan and a high - walled compound in one of the wealthiest parts of Kobe City .
Magazines , comics and movies glamorise the yakuza , who operate in plain sight in a way unthinkable to Western observers .
Dojin - kai 's headquarters is public and known to any Kurume taxi driver .
Signs on the doors of the six - storey building politely explain that the organisation has temporarily moved and provides its new address on the other side of the train station .
The new HQ , immediately identifiable by its business nameplate , is a two - storey compound in one of Kurume 's better neighbourhoods .
After a tense conversation , we 're allowed to talk to the acting boss , who shows us into a conference room dominated by portraits of chairman Yoshikazu Matsuo , murdered last year , and his replacement Tetsuji Kobayashi , who is in jail .
" You ca n't publish my name , " says the man , a 35 - year - old who chain smokes through the interview .
" We have always had a strong relationship with local people so this is a bad situation for us , " he explains .
" It is obvious that they are being manipulated by the cops , who want to crush us . "
The police , who declined to go on the record , deny this , as does Mr Kabashima .
" No ordinary person wants to live beside these gangs , " he says .
" There is a school close to the site of the machine - gun attack .
What if the bullets had hit children ? "
Mr Kabashima and his family have lived in fear since his name was published in the media last year , but he says his foes are " not stupid enough " to attack him .
The yakuza have long occupied an ambiguous position in Japan .
Like their Italian cousins , they have deep if murky historical links with the country 's ruling party , the Liberal Democrats .
A reputation for keeping disputes among themselves , not harming " non-combatants " , protected them from the ire of citizens and the attentions of the police .
That ambiguity was meant to have ended in 1992 when the government introduced tough anti-mob legislation , punishment for yakuza excesses during the booming 1980s when they moved into property and other legitimate businesses .

But the state still has n't made membership of a criminal organisation illegal or given the police the anti-mob tools long considered crucial in other countries : wiretapping , plea bargaining and witness protection , says Joshua Adelstein , author of a new book on the yakuza .
" As the yakuza continue to evolve and get into more sophisticated crimes , the police have had a tough time keeping up . "
A new police White Paper warns that the yakuza have moved into securities trading and infected hundreds of Japan 's listed companies .
Experts say the Yamaguchi - gumi , in particular , has resources to rival Japan 's larger corporations .
The lack of legal tools to fight the yakuza is painfully obvious in Kyushu , where the law only allows the plaintiffs to challenge hoods within a 500 m radius of their homes .
" It 's not easy to kick them out of town , " laments one .
" We 're demanding that they stop using the building as a place of gathering .
They own the building , it 's their property and we can't make them give it up . "
Even if they move , the mob will pop up somewhere else in Kurume , admits a senior official at the city office , which is backing the plaintiffs .
" The Japanese have learned to live with the yakuza , " said the official , who also asked to remain nameless .
The Dojin - kai are believed to operate protection rackets , transport firms , sex businesses and loan - sharking across the city .
If unchallenged , the mob invests huge untaxed profits in real estate , eventually taking over whole blocks of cities like this .
" We have to hope that if they relocate , the residents of the new area will challenge them again , " says the official .
" The yakuza are strong on a one - to - one basis but they are extremely weak in the face of collective action . "
Kurume 's problems began in 1986 - 87 when a feud between the Dojin-kai and a local affiliate of the Yamaguchi - gumi claimed nine lives and injured 16 people .
Local people organised a protest march on the gang headquarters .
The latest chapter began in May 2006 when the long - time Dojin - kai boss Seijiro Matsuo announced his resignation , sparking a war of succession with a splinter group , Kyushu Seido - kai .
Not everyone is rooting for the plaintiffs .
" We 're not against the people going to court but if they win , the yakuza might relocate close to us , " frets Yuichiro Okamura , who owns a small restaurant beside Kurume station .
The owner of a vegetable shop next to the Dojin - kai building said the plaintiffs should let sleeping dogs lie .
" The yakuza have never done anything to me .
But the people in that building have much better manners than some of the youngsters around here . "
As the legal battle takes off , the gangs appear to be winding down their war .
Seido - kai recently announced the resignation of its chairman and the end of hostilities with Dojin - kai in a statement sent to the local police .
But the plaintiffs still live in fear of intimidation or worse , and the authorities have given them beepers linked to local police stations .
" Unless we take action against them , the group will keep growing stronger , " said one .
" We do n't want them in this town . "
People living close to the Dojin - kai building are pessimistic that anything will change without government intervention .
" When the gangs moved here we protested to the city and they did nothing , " recalls a woman .
" The government did n't even come to see us .
At least the gangsters visited door - to - door to introduce themselves , " she said , explaining how they brought with them pink and white rice cakes , a traditional symbol of good luck and happiness .
" It was nothing to be happy about , " she adds .
Mr. McCain , on Monday you repeated your delusional notion that the fundamentals of the economy are strong .
Now , the federal government is working on a deal to save that economy from collapsing .
You have admitted that the economy is not your forte , so you could have used a running mate with some financial chops .
( Remember Mitt Romney ? )
But no .
Who did you pick ?
SnowJob SquareGlasses whose financial credentials include running Wasilla into debt , listing ( but not selling ) a plane on EBay and flip - flopping on a bridge to wherever .
In fact , when it comes to real issues in general , she may prove to be a liability .
In what respect , you may ask ?
It turns out that the Republican enthusiasm for Sarah Palin is just as superficial as she is .
They were so eager for someone to cheer for ( because they really do n’t like you ) that they dove face first into the Palin mirage .
But , on the issues , even they worry about her .

Keith delivered a scathing , impassioned Special Comment tonight , calling out John McCain and Sarah Palin 's dangerous , out - of - control hate rallies and their responsibility for stoking them .
Disgraceful ?
Obviously , Senator , you have n't heard your own speeches , and Governor Palin's , and what people shout during them .
And you have n't heard your state GOP Chair in Virginia , Jeffrey Frederick , giving talking points to 30 of your field - operatives heading out to canvass voters in Gainesville , Virginia ...
With a reporter present , telling them to try to forge a connection between Barack Obama and Osama Bin Laden - to emphasize bombings and terrorism .
And you have n't heard those volunteers , your volunteers Senator McCain , shout back " and he wo n't salute the flag " and " we do n't even know where Senator Obama was really born . "
Senator McCain -- these people are speaking for you !
Transcripts below the fold
And Number One : The John McCain Phony Umbrage Threat Level is Back To Red.
McCain supporters shout hateful , violent threats and incitements , at McCain events -- if you missed it , it happened before a Palin speech in Pennsylvania today -- and as usual , she said nothing to stop the fire .
And this is where the satire ends and the Special Comment begins .
Because this is not even remotely funny .
1:25 PM Eastern Time , today , in Scranton , Pennsylvania .
During the warm - up act by a Red Meat Congressional Candidate aptly named Chris Hackett , Hackett mentions Obama and a Palin audience member shouts " Kill Him . "
And Governor Palin , as usual , does nothing about it says nothing to these thugs and psychos .
She may not have heard this one .
It is impossible to believe that by now she has not heard about the other ones .
Her silence is deafening .
Just as , Senator McCain , you have done nothing when violence has been asserted .
Correction .
You have done one thing .
Asked why in real time you do not repudiate this hatefulness you act as if you are the victim .
Speaking today to our NBC Station in Washington .
McCain : " Sure and I repudiated it as I have on several occasions .
Unfortunately , Congressman John Lewis is an American hero who I admire who made the worst , most unacceptable statement a couple days ago that I have ever heard .
He accused me and Sarah Palin of being involved in segregation , George Wallace and even made reference to a church bombing where children were killed .
Senator Obama has not repudiated that statement .
Senator Obama should do so immediately .
Its the most outrageous thing that I have heard since in politics … it is disgraceful . "
Disgraceful ?
Obviously , Senator , you have n't heard your own speeches , and Governor Palin's , and what people shout during them .
And you have n't heard your state GOP Chair in Virginia , Jeffrey Frederick , giving talking points to 30 of your field - operatives heading out to canvass voters in Gainesville , Virginia .
With a reporter present ... telling them to try to forge a connection between Barack Obama and Osama Bin Laden to emphasize bombings and terrorism .
And you have n't heard those volunteers , your volunteers Senator McCain , shout back " and he wo n't salute the flag " and " we do n't even know where Senator Obama was really born . "
Senator McCain -- these ... people ... are ... speaking ... for ... you !
And how dare you try to claim Congressman Lewis was linking you to Governor George Wallace 's segregation .
He was linking you , aptly , to Governor George Wallace 's lynch - mob mentality .
" As public figures with the power to influence and persuade , " said Congressman Lewis , " Sen. McCain and Gov. Palin are playing with fire , and if they are not careful , that fire will consume us all . "
Senator McCain , your supporters , at your events , are calling Obama a terrorist and traitor and are calling for him to be killed .
And yet you keep bringing back these same rabid Right Wing nuts to deliberately stir these crowds into frenzies .
And then you take offense when somebody who remembers the violence in our political past , calls you on it .
You , sir , are responsible for a phalanx of individuals who are shouting fire in a crowded theatre .
There are some things to respect and honor about you , Senator McCain .
But on this , you 're not only a fraud , Senator but you are tacitly inciting lunatics to violence .
If you want to again grand - stand and suspend your campaign here 's your big chance .
Suspend your campaign now , until you , or somebody else , gets some control over it and it ceases to be a clear and present danger to the peace of this nation .

Does Race Matter In '08 ?
The View From York , Pa .
All Things Considered , · Most voters say they wo n't decide between Barack Obama and John McCain on the basis of race .
But , in a question that is more subtle than the standard questions in a poll , can a decision be based on the racial experience of the voter ?
Of the 13 voters interviewed by Morning Edition and All Things Considered , many said this election had them thinking about race in new ways .
" I do n't know if I can see another old white man as president , " says Cal Weary .
He 's a black high school drama teacher who voted for President Bush in the past two elections .
He knows that his declaration might sound harsh .
" And that sounds very racist for me to say it that way , but it is about appearances , and it is about this country , everywhere else being looked as being the biggest lie , " Weary says .
" You tell everyone in the world that we have the greatest opportunities here , you tell them anyone can start from shining shoes and be in charge of a Fortune 500 company , but then you say to the rest of the world , you say , ' You can have everything , but you can't live in the big White House . ' "
The discussion was difficult for some , who folded their arms , sighed nervously and — at times — were confrontational .
" I do n't think there is a problem with a black man , " says Don Gettys , a retired police officer , who is white .
" I personally do n't think Obama is the right one .
He does n't have the experience . "
Margie Orr , a black receptionist , takes exception to Gettys ' view of Obama 's experience .
" My thing is , though , what would make you think Palin would be — OK — we know John McCain has medical problems , God forbid that this man is elected , and this white female , so what you 're saying is , though , the United States would rather see — as long as they 're white — they do n't care if she 's even a female , but as long as it's a white person ... "
" No , I do n't think that 's the case , " Gettys responds .
" She has more executive experience than he does .
He was a community organizer .
Nobody 's ever told me what a community organizer is . "
Says Orr : " Then maybe that 's something then that you need to investigate . "
Experiences With Race
But in order to understand how — or if — race affects voting decisions , it helps to learn more about these voters ' experiences with race .
" I can't recall any privilege that I got because I was white , " Gettys says .
" I mean , I went to city schools .
But I do n't know of anything that I got because I was white that the black kids could n't have gotten the same thing . "
Margie
Orr recalls that hers was the first black family to move to their suburb .
That was in 1963 .
" We were n't wanted there , of course , and the whites did everything they could to intimidate us to get us to move , " Orr says .
" But my parents were staunch - hearted people .
We were n't going to budge .
So , of course , we stayed there .
We endured it all : the break - ins , the house being messed up , the whole nine yards , being called niggers . "
Orr dabs at her eyes when questioning why diversity has to be enforced .
" I mean , my parents taught me to love everybody .
So I 'm saying , ' But you have to be taught to love me ? ' " she says .
" That 's hard to understand . "
Leah Moreland , a widow and former factory worker , says she grew up on a farm and was very sheltered .
" I really was totally unaware of prejudice , " Moreland says .
Moreland says she lived at the end of West 6 Market Street bus line .
" There was a black man who would ride the bus and come out to the end of the line with his shotgun on the bus that would go groundhog hunting , " Moreland says .
" Dad would go out and say ' How many orders do you have , ' because the people in the black community here in York ate groundhog .
In fact , my mother cooked groundhog .
And he would go out and hunt , but there was no prejudice in my home . "
Race And Decision - Making
The hosts asked the voters who they planned to back in November , and how their racial experience or identity factored into that decision .
Orr , who still carries the scars of integration , says she plans to vote for Obama .
She says her vote is based on pride , but you get a sense of something else :
" I'm a Democrat , and I 'm going to vote for Obama , and one of the reasons is because he is black , " Orr says .
" I think he is qualified and come on , let 's face facts .
This man is going to be wiretapped up to his eyeballs .
Come on people .
You really think he is going to be put in office , and they are not going to keep an eye on him ?
Be for real .
" They are going to watch this man like white on rice .
He 's not going to be his own person per se .
He is going to be screened to the max .
...
The white system ... that 's who ' they ' are , OK ? "
Jeff Lobach , a white attorney , says he is surprised by the intolerance he sees in York today .
" White people are almost invariably shocked when they hear some of the things that African - Americans have to put up with , " Lobach says .
" It cuts across economic groups , too .
African - American professionals in this town are treated differently .
These are highly paid folks who are part of the ' haves ' right now .
We have had incidents where white lawyers wo n't shake the hand of a black lawyer . "
But he also says he senses that change is in the air .
Racial attitudes are shifting , including his own .
" I think if Sen . Obama is elected , it 's not going to be because he 's African - American , " Lobach says .
" I think we can all agree on that .
If he 's defeated , I hope it's not because he's an African - American , I think we all agree about that , too . "
But Lobach still has a solid allegiance to his party : " I am an enthusiastic supporter of McCain right now , because I think this is his moment . "
Leah Moreland , the woman who said she grew up sheltered from prejudice , plans to vote for McCain .
Party loyalty is also part of her decision .
But her cultural compass also comes into play .
She says her gut tells her not to trust Obama .
" I look at Obama , and I have a question in my mind , " she says .
" Years ago , was he taken into the Muslim faith ?
And my concern is the only way you are no longer a Muslim is if you are dead , killed .
So in my mind , he 's still alive . "
Although Barack Obama has said repeatedly he is not a Muslim and has never been a Muslim , Moreland is still unconvinced .
" There is something about him I do n't trust , " she says .
" I do n't care how good a speaker he is , I just can't trust him . "
Where They Fall
At the end of the evening , a tally was taken of the support for the candidates .
Of the seven white voters and six voters of color , the majority of white voters are supporting McCain .
All of the people of color are supporting Obama .
What does that say ?
Coincidence ?
Or is something else at work ?
" I only heard one person even say or even think the reason they were voting that was because of race , " says property manager Charlotte Bergdoll , the sole undecided voter .
She said she did n't see a connection between race and political choice , and in that assessment she was n't alone .
But after the voters spent more time debating that divide — again , all the voters of color behind Obama , and almost all the white voters behind John McCain — most came to a reluctant conclusion .
Does race matter on a subconscious level ?
There was a series of exasperated utterances of " Yes . "
And that raises one last question : Just how much are people aware of their biases or fears ?
Cal Weary — black drama teacher , former Bush backer , current Obama supporter — says deep divisions on race might always be an obstacle .
" When someone asks the question like , ' Is America ready for a black president ? '
They 're saying , ' Has American forgotten what it 's done to black people ? ' and ' Have the black people forgotten what has been done to them ? ' "
Weary says .
" Is he going to be able to go in there and be respected ?
Because they 're still making comments like : ' Oh , but he 's so well - spoken , ' and ' Oh my goodness , he 's different than the rest . ' "
" [ It 's ] the same kind of thing I grew up with , " Weary notes .
" And I understand why they 're asking the question .
If you ask me if America is ready for it , I do n't think they are .
But when are we ever ready for anything that is a radical change ? "

1939 C. Cotterman and L. Snyder , in Journal of the American Statistical Association , 1939 , 34 , 511 - 23 Reported in : Anne Anastasi , Differential Psychology , 3rd edition , 1958 Reported in Gene Expression .
5.25 " Cotterman and Snyder studied the ability to taste phenyl - thiocarbamide among 800 families .
Most people find this chemical tastes intensely bitter , but some cannot taste it at all .
The ability to taste is inherited as a simple Mendelian dominant .
Non-tasters are homozygous for the recessive non-taster allele .
Two non -taster parents therefore should not have any taster children .
Yet out of 223 children born to such couples , 5 ( 2.24 % of the total ) were tasters " . " ....
The full incidence would be higher , because even with cuckoldry not all of the offspring of non-taster women would be tasters ....
The value of p in the study population can estimated from the fact that 86 of the 800 families ( 10.75 % ) contained two non-taster parents .
Since the proportion of non-tasters in the population is q-sq. , the proportion of couples in which both partners are non-tasters should be q - to - the - 4 .
This gives a value of about .573 for q and .427 for p.
The full incidence of cuckoldry implied by these data is therefore 2.24%/.427 = 5.25 % . "

It has been shown that 30 to 40 % of these men who deny paternity are falsely accused .
In the majority of cases heard in the courts , however , the accused man admits paternity and accepts the burden of support imposed by the court .
Using the A - B - O blood typing system it was found that 18 % of the men who had voluntarily admitted paternity , were not the actual fathers of the children .
" Blood - grouping tests in 67 cases of uncontested paternity indicate that in 6 cases , or 9 % , the men admitting paternity were not the fathers of the children they accepted .
Since only 50 % of wrongfully accused men can be excluded by present methods of blood testing , it follows that not 6 but actually 12 men in this small series who admitted paternity were probably not the fathers of the children in question " .

30 Philipp :
We blood - tested some patients in a town in south - east England , and found that 30 % of the husbands could not have been the fathers of their children ....
Killbrandon : Mr Philipp , surely the figure of 30 % must be a minimum ?
What you established was that 30 % could not be the children of their mother 's husband , not that 70 % of them were ?
Philipp : Yes , it is a minimum .
We were screening some female patients by testing their husbands for their blood groups , because we were interested in antibody formation in correlation with the ABO groups as well as the rhesus groups .
From our results we suddenly realised that 30 % of the children could not have been fathered by the men whose blood group we analysed .
Stallworthy :
What was the extent of that group ?
Philipp :
Not large - between 200 and 300 women - but large enough to give a great shock .

As the apparent fathers were questioned while visiting their wives immediately after the birth , most of them obviously thought they were the father ....

An extremely rare female frog has been spotted for the first time in 20 years .
The tiny tree frog , Isthmohyla rivularis , was seen in Costa Rica 's Monteverde Cloud Forest Preserve .
This species was thought to have become extinct two decades ago , but last year a University of Manchester researcher caught a glimpse of a male .
However , the discovery of the female and more males suggests this species is breeding and has been able to survive where many other frogs have not .
Andrew Gray , a herpetologist from Manchester Museum at the University of Manchester , said : " This has been the highlight of the whole of my career .
The only time you ever come across a female is by chance
Andrew Gray
" Now that we know that both sexes exist in the wild , we should intensify efforts to understand their ecology and further their conservation . "
The BBC has been following the team from the University of Manchester and Chester Zoo that is working on amphibian conservation programmes
The BBC video of the frog is the first - known footage of this species .
The 2.5 cm - long female , which was released after the discovery , was brown with metallic green speckles and was packed full of eggs .
A difficult task Finding female frogs is extremely difficult ; males make a distinctive call but females are silent for most of the time .
And tracking down this particular species in a great expanse of rainforest was even more difficult - the team had few clues about where the frogs might be , and the search could only take place at night .
The team trekked deep into the forest to a spot close to where the male Isthmohyla rivularis was spotted last year .
The researchers first discovered another male from its soft insect - like call .
The conservationists then trained their torches on the undergrowth , and eventually Luis Obando , head of park maintenance at Monteverde 's Tropical Science Center , found the tiny female , which was sitting on a leaf .
Mr Gray told the BBC : " It is hard to describe just how unlikely it was to have discovered a female of this particular species .
" The only time you ever come across a female is by chance - and it is only once in a blue moon that they come down to lay their eggs .
You really have to be in the right place at the right time .
" You could come out here every night for a year and not see a thing .
" I really think that this time we have had luck on our side . "

The discovery of both sexes of this species has given the researchers hope that this population may be surviving against the odds .
Mr Gray explained : " Last year , when we saw the male , we had no idea whether this was one of the last few remaining male specimens of this species .
" But now we have found the female , there is hope that the species may recover .
" It still seems that these critically endangered creatures are on the very brink of extinction - and although we have been intensively searching the streams all through the night , it appears that the density of the population is precarious . "
The researchers swabbed the frogs before they were released to see if they are carrying the chytrid fungus - a disease thought to have killed of many other species in this area .
They also used a spectrometer to look at the properties of the frogs ' skin to try to find out why this species has survived where others have not .
" It is imperative for the future conservation of Costa Rican amphibians that collaborative efforts harness the skills of biologists , researchers , educators and committed individuals , if we are to save these rare species , " Mr Gray added .

What are these ?
But to a lesser extent , this discussion has been boiling under the surface of HIV prevention and activist activities for some time .
Reading the responses around the North Carolina case both on Bilerico and on several listserves I am a member of was , quite frankly disgusting .
In a less public story , an HIV positive man here in Michigan has been charged with violating our HIV disclosure law , a felony , and exposing two women to HIV .
Over the last week or so , there has been an overwhelming amount of discussion about HIV disclosure laws and the criminalization of HIV - positive statuses in the United States .
The discussions came about in part because of a story in Q - Notes of North Carolina about a D.J. in local club who had plead guilty to exposing partners to HIV .
It was a misdemeanor crime in North Carolina .
The following comment from Wolfgang E.B. here on Bilerico adequately shows the amount of fear mongering and outright stigma associated with HIV non-disclosure :
I agree with you , Lucrece .
Knowingly spreading a deadly contagion is , at best , negligent homicide ; at worst , first degree murder .
I have the deepest sympathy for anyone who is HIV positive , no matter how they got it , but it comes with a responsibility to protect the safety of others .
I do hope this law applies to * all * serious communicable diseases though , not just HIV .
I 've never heard anything but AIDS mentioned when it 's brought up .
I am HIV - positive .
I was infected in March of 2007 by a partner who was infected but afraid to disclose because he had been rejected by friends and family when he was diagnosed .
We practiced safer sex , however , I was infected anyway .
Now , under Michigan law , I could charge this person with a felony , sending him to prison for up to four years and thus exposing him exceptionally high rates of Hepatitis B and C ( links to PDF ) as well as HIV , or I could take a compassionate perspective and understand the social and political realities this partner was suffering under .
What he did was negligent , there is no question about it .
However , did it rise to the level of criminal activity ?
Hardly .
And that is the exact issue with HIV disclosure laws and their failure in America .
It is time to address the real issues of HIV infection , exposure , and non-disclosure .
( To be clear , do not construe this post to be an advocating for not disclosing HIV status to partners .
I am not a fool enough to believe that we live in a perfect world where HIV - positive persons are afforded respect and dignity and that in some cases disclosure could seriously put persons with HIV at risk for violence , discrimination , and more . )
The History of HIV Disclosure Criminal Laws
Criminalization of HIV transmission was mandated in 1990 with the passage of the Ryan White CARE Act .
In the Act , states were required to certify that they had laws to criminalize the transmission of HIV .
All states had reached that necessary certification by 2000 , and thus the rider was not reauthorized .
However , the law has left a hodge - podge of legal liabilities which vary from state to state and in some instances from action to action .
In other words , an action in Michigan may be a felony , but in another state , like California , it might not even be criminal .
In Michigan , the law is particularly appalling , in that it demands disclosure of HIV - positive status prior to any " penetration ... however slight . "
The law follows :
333.5210 Sexual penetration as felony ; definition .
Sec. 5210 . ( 1 ) A person who knows that he or she has or has been diagnosed as having acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome related complex , or who knows that he or she is HIV infected , and who engages in sexual penetration with another person without having first informed the other person that he or she has acquired immunodeficiency syndrome or acquired immunodeficiency syndrome related complex or is HIV infected , is guilty of a felony .
( 2 ) As used in this section , " sexual penetration " means sexual intercourse , cunnilingus , fellatio , anal intercourse , or any other intrusion , however slight , of any part of a person 's body or of any object into the genital or anal openings of another person 's body , but emission of semen is not required .
Evidently in Michigan , if you and I decide to have sex using toys , and I do n't disclose I 'm HIV - positive , I have committed a felony .
To be fair , this law was written in 1987 , at the height of the HIV pandemic 's most brutal assault on humans in the U.S. and because of the lackluster behavior of Ronald Reagan 's Health and Human Services Department , the U.S. did not know as much about HIV and its transmission as we do now .
But why has this law not been amended to reflect a more current understanding of the biology and epidemiology of the virus ?
And what makes matters worse in Michigan is that the Michigan Supreme Court has ruled the law is constitutional in People v. Jensen :
Considering the ease of transmitting AIDS and HIV through sexual penetration [ * 464 ] and the absence of any " cure , " the state 's interest in protecting the public health , safety , and general welfare of its citizenry becomes extremely significant .
Although the statute may significantly infringe on defendant 's individual interests in remaining silent , the state 's interest to compel her to disclose her HIV status before engaging in sexual penetration is undeniably overwhelming .
Interestingly , Hepatitis C , which has a .6 % prevalence in Michigan residents , and is just as dangerous , if not more so , an infection as HIV -- is not subject to disclosure by HCV - positive persons before sexual activity .
Should n't that state also hold HCV to a similar criminal level , under " the state 's overriding , legitimate and compelling interest in preserving the life of its citizens , " as the Court ruled in Jensen ?
Laws are Counter to HIV Prevention Messages
The fact of the matter is that most of these laws ( 23 states have some form of criminal law on the issue of HIV transmission .
The laws are explicit in mentioning HIV ) , do not mention prevention efforts in sexual contact .
In fact , only three of the 23 state laws mention condoms , and only two of these imply some form of protection involved .
Most of the laws make no determination of harm mitigation taken by the HIV - positive person , and present HIV disclosure as paramount , over other actions .
But the reality is far more complicated .
First of all , thinking back on our toys and sex question , there is not a single case of toys transmitting the virus .
Yet this completely safe activity is a criminal act in Michigan if the HIV - positive person does not first disclose his or her status .
But let 's look a little more closely at risk probabilities based on behavior .
To address this issue , I am going to quote extensively from from The Journal of Law , Medicine & Ethics , Summer 2004 , " Toward Rational Criminal HIV Exposure Laws " by Carol L. Galletly , and Steven D. Pinkerton .
Unprotected anal intercourse is the riskiest sexual activity .
The probability of HIV being transmitted from an HIV - infected man to his uninfected partner through a single act of unprotected anal intercourse is approximately 1 in 50 if the infected man is the insertive partner and 1 in 2000 if he is the receptive partner .
The risks associated with unprotected vaginal intercourse are relatively small as well : approximately 1 in 1000 for male - to - female transmission and 1 in 2000 for female - to - male transmission .
Less is known about the probability of HIV transmission through oral sex .
Although there have been a small number of cases in which HIV reportedly was transmitted through cunnilingus , analingus , or being the insertive partner in fellatio , the risk associated with these activities is generally ( though not universally ) considered to be negligible .
In contrast , while the risk to the receptive ( " giving " ) partner in fellatio is less than the risk associated with anal or vaginal intercourse , it is not negligible .
One study estimated the per-act risk to the partner performing fellatio to be 1 in 2500 .
Co-factors that can increase the likelihood that HIV would be transmitted by these activities include gum disease , infection of the mouth or throat by a sexually transmitted infection ( STI ) , or other lesions in the oral cavity .
When used correctly and consistently , latex condoms reduce the likelihood of HIV transmission by as much as 90 % or more .
13 Stated another way , condoms reduce the probability of HIV transmission by about a factor of 10 .
For example , the probability of an infected man transmitting the virus to his partner during a single act of condom - protected anal intercourse is 1 in 500 if the infected man is the insertive partner and 1 in 20,000 if he is the receptive partner .
These transmission estimates assume that the partners engage in the specified sexual activity only once .
Multiple sex acts increase the probability of transmission in an approximately linear fashion .
For example , engaging in the same activity twice approximately doubles the risk of transmission .
It is important to note that there is considerable uncertainty surrounding the transmission probabilities cited above .
These difficult - to - estimate probabilities represent averages over groups of people and neglect potential interpersonal and intrapersonal variability in infectiousness and susceptibility to HIV infection .
A number of factors play a role in whether a person will become HIV infected after exposure to the virus , including the strength of the exposed person 's immune system , the infected person 's stage of HIV disease and , in particular , the quantity of virus in his or her genital fluids , and whether or not the infected person is receiving effective antiretroviral treatment , which decreases viral load .
The presence of transmission - facilitating factors in either partner , such as genital or anal lesions or other disrupted tissue , or infection with a sexually - transmitted pathogen other than HIV also plays a role in determining whether a person who is HIV - exposed will become HIV - infected .
These uncertainties preclude pinpointing the exact risk associated with a particular sexual activity .
Nevertheless , it is clear that a hierarchy of risks exists and , moreover , that these risks are generally small .
One way to depict these generalized estimates of risk is to categorize sexual activities according to one of three levels of risk ( e.g. , lowest risk , medium risk , and highest risk . )
Sexual activities that pose the lowest risk of HIV transmission include masturbation of a partner and receiving cunnilingus or fellatio .
Sexual activities that occupy the mid-range of risk for HIV transmission include insertive anal and vaginal intercourse , and giving fellatio .
Sexual activities that pose the highest risk of HIV transmission include receptive anal and vaginal intercourse .
So what messages do these laws send ?
First , they ignore the protective potential of condoms .
from Gallety and Pinkerton again :
Finally , sensible and meaningful HIV exposure law is based on conscious choices about actual risk and criminal intention .
Efforts to reduce the risk of HIV transmission through condom use or through the practice of less risky sexual activities impact of these central factors .
Both condom use and the practice of less risky behaviors such as mutual masturbation dramatically reduce the likelihood of HIV transmission and provide substantial evidence that an individual is not deliberately attempting to infect a partner .
The lack of consideration given to risk reduction measures in the majority of criminal HIV exposure statutes is a striking omission .[...] condom use or the practice of alternative sexual behaviors reduces risk sufficiently to be considered a mitigating factor or a defense to criminal prosecution for exposure , omitting discussion of condom use entirely runs counter to prevailing public health messages which stress practicing safer sex with all partners until they are sure of their own and their partners ' serostatus .
To whatever extent possible , HIV exposure laws and public health recommendations should avoid sending mixed messages to HIV - infected persons ( and to persons at risk of HIV infection ) regarding what is or is not risky , and what is or is not prosecutable behavior .
In another study by Professor Carol Galletly and Professor Steven Pinkerton from the Center for AIDS Intervention Research , at the Medical College of Wisconsin 's Department of Psychiatry and Behavioral Medicine found :
Public health interventions aimed at preventing HIV transmission emerged as formidable , though not infallible , forces with which to contain the US epidemic .
Unfortunately , one of the nation 's most broad - reaching , and some might argue , potentially most powerful tools with which to disseminate and reinforce this public health response , the criminal law , promulgated a message of a different kind .
The two researchers conclude " existing HIV serostatus disclosure laws not only fail to complement public health prevention efforts to promote condom use , they appear to undermine them . "
Moreover , the disclosure - based norm endorsed by these laws encourages at - risk persons to rely on prospective sex partners to disclose their HIV status , if positive , and to assume that there is minimal risk absent positive serostatus disclosure .
Serostatus disclosure laws thus may foster a false sense of security among HIV - negative persons who may choose to forgo condom use unless notified of their partners ' HIV - positive status .
Stigmatization
The same authors write , " By suggesting that criminal laws are needed to protect an ' innocent ' public from HIV infection , HIV disclosure laws may perpetuate the stereotype of the wanton or desperate HIV - positive person who is a threat to society , thereby contributing to continued HIV - related stigma . "
The fact remains that people , HIV - positive or not , require intimacy .
When faced with the unbearable to decision to disclose an HIV - positive status or to be able to have intimacy ( whether it is kissing ( a potential felony for an HIV - positive person in Idaho , or all out sex ) -- most people will fall on the side of intimacy .
This is a basic reality of Maslow 's Hierrarchy of Needs and to expect anything less is unfair to the basic humanity of persons with HIV .
The community 's responsibility
These laws place the responsibility for HIV prevention not on everyone having sex , but on the person who is HIV - positive .
But what the hell happened to personal responsibility ?
If Person A engages in sex with Person B and gets HIV or any other infection , who is responsible for that infection ?
Both partners are equally culpable .
Let 's say in our scenario Person A knew he was infected with HIV but failed to disclose .
And let 's further presume that Person B assumed Person A was HIV negative and was less than cautious sexually ( like I was ) .
Person B is just as responsible as Person A .
Why ?
He has a personal responsibility to protect himself from potential deadly contagions .
And ultimately that is the greatest concern I have about the HIV disclosure laws , that they allow one party to abdicate his or her responsibility for his or her own safety to another person , then hold the other person criminally responsible .
So where do we go from here ?
First of all , we have to take the words of Matt Foreman , the former executive director of The National Gay and Lesbian Task Force , seriously .
During the Creating Change Conference here in Detroit this year , Matt said " We can not deny [ HIV ] is a gay disease .
We have to own up to it . "
We , as the LBGT community , have to own up to how this disease is still impacting our community in the US in a manner which is out of whack with HIV infection rates in other communities .
And we have to admit that we have abandoned our brothers of color and offered a hand up to confront the epidemic which is eating away at them when they are young ( 13 - 24 ) .
We have to tell the older men that the HIV epidemic is not over and that we cannot loosen the grip on safer sex practices we held at one time .
Second , we must move ourselves back into a discussion of personal responsibility .
This discussion must not condemn or judge , but it must be open and honest .
The fact is that many gay and bisexual men have found that bareback sex is pleasurable to them .
Rather than tell them there is something wrong with them for fetishizing it , we need to stop and address the reality of barebacking by addressing the harm reductions HIV negative men can take .
We must also allow for , and accept the fact , that HIV - positive men are sexual beings still .
Finally we need to have a bit of a reality check .
Twenty - five percent of persons infected with HIV in the US do not even know they have the virus .
We must revert back to the prevention message of the 90s. of using a condom with every sexual act , consistently and correctly and that each participant has an obligation to act in a manner which protects themselves from infection not only from HIV , but from other STI 's as well .
That means to a point that no matter how hot the trick on Saturday night is , and no matter how much you want to believe him when he says he is HIV negative , it means you put a condom on him anyway .
And you wear one to .
There is no excuse not to do so .
That hot trick might think he is negative , but in reality he might be infected and not know .
He might also be infected and know and so lonely and in need of intimacy , that he can't tell you he is positive for fear of rejection .
It means it is time to walk away from criminalizing HIV - positive sero- statuses , and back into the operation that anyone could be infected with HIV and the only way you can prevent becoming infected is to take responsibility for yourself and protect yourself .
McCain jumped in and did the manly - man thing , saving his damsel in distress from having to answer a real question from a real reporter like all the other candidates in this race do on a regular basis .
I ’m sorry , strike that .
McCain has n’t had a press conference in over a month , so he ’s not answering any questions either ( which kind of makes you wonder what ’s wrong with the 72 year old candidate who has 4 bouts of serious melanoma ) .
CNN ’s Campbell Brown said last night that McCain ’s behavior , in treating Palin like some weak defenseless thing just because she ’s a woman , is sexist .
Enthusiastic supporter injures Cindy McCain's hand
Republican John McCain 's wife has been treated for a " minor sprain " after someone at a campaign event in Michigan shook her hand firmly .
A campaign spokeswoman says Cindy McCain left the West Bloomfield , Mich. , campaign event Wednesday for X - rays at a local hospital after an enthusiastic supporter squeezed too much .
McCain 's wife has had previous surgeries for carpal tunnel syndrome and the handshake exacerbated the condition .
Spokeswoman Jill Hazelbaker says Mrs. McCain will campaign as planned on Thursday .

Feral cat populations are increasing dramatically worldwide as climate change causes warm breeding seasons to stretch into winter months .
Australia , the world ’s Petri dish for the impacts of global warming , is reporting a rapid increase ; in Melbourne alone the count of stray cats has increased to over 500,000 , and the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals is becoming concerned .
“ Warmer weather is improving breeding conditions , extending breeding seasons and reducing the natural attrition rate , resulting in thousands more kittens being born into lives of disease , neglect and starvation , ” said spokesperson Andrew Foran .
Shelters across the United States have found a similar problem .
For example , the Philadelphia Animal Welfare Society took in 672 kittens in February 2007 , but in February this year the facility received 1,008 .
The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency backs up these numbers on their website , saying that small mammals are breeding earlier due to warmer temperatures .
However , experts are conflicted on the issue .
Christine Petersen , an assistant professor at Iowa State University ’s College of Veterinary Medicine , said that warming should not affect feline breeding because their cycles are based on light , not heat .
Julie Levy , a veterinary professor at the University of Florida , said that the population numbers do n’t lie .
She said that cats , like other mammals , may be reaching puberty sooner in the warmer temperatures , thus increasing the number of fertile cats in the population and spurring the growth .
But she still did n’t discount the idea that individual cats may be breeding more often or earlier as well .
“ Domestic cats evolved from African ancestors , ” she said .
“ Although they have adapted to climates throughout the world , it is possible that global warming is mimicking their ancient origins and helping them reach their full reproductive potential . ”

Again I have a friend – a rock - ribbed Republican who would not vote for a Democrat to win a bet , but who refuses to vote for McCain .
Why ?
“ Because he ’s a lousy pilot . ”
( My friend was a career Navy Pilot , who flew everything the Navy had to offer . )
“ The only thing he has going for him is five years as a POW , as he reminds us every five minutes .
He ’d never have been a POW if he had n’t been a lousy pilot .
And if , after all the training he got , he could n’t even fly an aircraft , how can I expect him to be able to manage the Nation ?
Look .
He ’s smart enough to have been in the top ten at the Academy instead of the bottom five .
He was too interested in partying to study , and he should never have been accepted for flight training .
He obviously paid little attention to that , either ; he has always done just enough to get by – and in Wartime , that ’s not enough , nor is it enough to run the most important country in the world ! ”
“ So who are you going to vote for ? ”
“ Probably nobody .
I ca n’t vote for Nader , and Barr is n’t all that great .
I WISH the party had nominated Paul – I could support him in a heartbeat ! ”
Interesting .
He did n’t even mention McC ’s somewhat checkered career or doubtful associates ; he opposes him strictly on the grounds of ability – possibly something we all should do .

Dear Karen , I saw it with my own eyes :
The Bush and GOP machine stole the 2000 election and the presidency in Florida ( not to mention Ohio in 2004 ) and the results have been catastrophic for our nation and the world .
Do n't take my word for it - read the dissent of Supreme Court Justices Stevens , Breyer and Ginsberg in the absurd legal decision of Bush v. Gore : " Although we may never know with complete certainty the identity of the winner of this year 's Presidential election , the identity of the loser is perfectly clear .
It is the Nation 's confidence in the judge as an impartial guardian of the rule of law . "
Back in 2000 , in Florida , I witnessed the votes of World War II veterans thrown away and GOP thugs bully the Miami Dade elections office into stopping a recount .
I swore to myself that never again would the votes of Americans be thrown away and replaced by the votes of appointed judges .
Following the 2000 election , I spent 7 years fighting to remove the DIEBOLD electronic machines from Florida and to install a voter verified paper trail which we accomplished last year .
I have bad news :
They are trying again to silence our votes .
Most people associate the 2000 election with paper " chads " and the Supreme Court 's tragic decision .
Yet the voter suppression in 2000 went way beyond not counting votes – from illegal roadblocks near minority precincts to the complete purging of legitimate voters from the rolls through what is called " voter caging " – the practice of using databases to improperly delete voters .
Now , we are seeing signs of voter caging again in both Michigan and Florida .
In Michigan , the state is using a list of foreclosures to purge voters ( many of which are still legitimate voters in their districts ) .
In Florida , my home state , the Republican led Supervisor of Elections is aggressively applying a new law designed to limit voter fraud by summarily deleting voters who might have – as part of a clerical error – a different driver 's license or social security number than was put in the database .
If legitimate , legal voters are denied access to the voting booth – we risk a repeat of 2000 , in multiple states .
We must remain vigilant , not just in defense of our economy , but in defense of our rights as Americans .
I am working with my colleagues in Congress to call attention to this matter , but I encourage you to contact your state elections supervisor and demand that they allow every person who claims to be a legitimate voter to submit a provisional ballot .
There is a system in every state to deal with provisional ballots – to verify their legitimacy after the fact .
Voter caging is a threat to our ( already challenged ) democratic principals .
Please join me and pass this email along to spread the word .
If you have not already signed up at www.wexlerforcongress.com, and would like to be on this list , please sign up today .

" Vulva " is a funny word .
Vulva . Vulva . Vulllllllllvaaaaaaaa .
See you Monday !
( Vulva )
One of the most amazing things about the stir caused by the recently leaked HHS proposal is how little , make that no , effort has been made to investigate whether the claim by the anti-abortion establishment about the mode of action of hormonal birth control is even true .
A subsequent draft of the regulations without the redefinition of abortion has been released , but the underlying question — can contraception prevent implantation ? — still stands .
Now , of course , for pro-choice people , this is a moot point .
Even if hormonal birth control could prevent a fertilized egg from implanting in the womb , that ’s not abortion because pregnancy does n’t begin until implantation .
To enter into this discussion is to first set aside the medical and legal definition of pregnancy and indulge the extremists .
That ’s why this discussion never really happens .
But what would we find if we did indulge them ?
According to the Code of Federal Regulations , The American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the National Institutes of Health , pregnancy begins when a fertilized egg implants in the womb .
Until it affixes to the woman ’s womb a fertilized egg can not receive nutrients from the woman ’s body , which is essential for it to grow .
Implantation is also the only way in which a pregnancy can be determined , there is no test that can tell when an egg has been fertilized — there is no way of knowing whether or not this has happened .
Implantation is what sets in motion all the signs that pregnancy has begun .
On this one point , science , medicine and the law agree : implantation is the moment at which pregnancy starts .
The only dissenting group is the pro-life movement , which dismisses this definition .
It , instead , would like pregnancy to start at the unknowable moment the sperm fertilizes an egg .
Once sperm meets egg , any effort to prevent the egg from implanting in the womb is considered an abortion by the pro-life movement .
This is one of the arguments they offer up as justification for the campaigns to keep women from using birth control .
Their claim is that most birth control methods prevent fertilized eggs from implanting in the womb , which to them , though not to science , is an abortion .
But even that is not true .
There is no evidence that birth control methods actually do what pro-life groups claim .
Sex .
Abortion .
Parenthood .
Power .
The latest news , delivered straight to your inbox .

Prompted , in part , by the growing efforts of anti-abortion groups to define birth control as abortion , the American Journal of Obstetrics and Gynecology in 1999 reviewed the available research on “ the mechanism of action ” of the contraceptive methods that so dismay pro-lifers .
The authors take up the pro-life concerns directly writing , “ Recently , some special interest groups have claimed , without providing any scientific rationale , that some methods of contraception may have an abortifacient effect . ”
After reviewing the available literature , the authors conclude that hormonal contraceptive methods ( oral contraceptives , the patch , the ring , the shot ) cause a number of changes in a woman ’s body which prevent
pregnancy .
Primarily , what they do is simply prevent ovulation .
In other words , take the pill and in almost all instances a woman wo n’t release an egg .
No egg , no chance of pregnancy .
The secondary way these contraceptives function , the authors report , is by preventing fertilization .
So , on the very slim chance that a woman using a hormonal method does produce an egg another mechanism of action kicks in .
Hormonal contraceptives also thicken the mucus lining of women ’s reproductive organs which hamper the ability of the sperm to even get to the egg .
And if a rogue sperm reaches the egg , hormonal contraceptives prevent it from penetrating the egg .
Specifically , they stop the shell encasing the egg from disintegrating so a sperm ca n’t actually do the deed of fertilization .
This is what is known about how hormonal birth control works .
What gets pro-lifers so worked up is that they insist on believing that a fertilized egg can be stopped from implanting in the womb .
First off , hormonal contraceptives stop fertilization .
What if , through some extraordinary , unknown , and seemingly unknowable process , an egg got fertilized ?
The researchers
consider the question and report , “ No direct evidence exists showing that implantation is prevented by progestin - only methods ” and “ The evidence does not support the theory that the usual mechanism of action of IUDs is destruction of fertilized ova in the uterus , ” say the authors .
After reviewing all the research available on the modes of action of all contraceptives in question the authors summarize their report by explaining that “ Even though the precise mechanism of action of modern contraceptive is not yet fully known , scientific evidence suggests the main mechanisms of action for each method .
Inhibition of ovulation and effects on the cervical mucus are the primary mechanisms of the contraceptive action of hormonal methods .
Evidence indicates that the primary mechanism of action of IUDs is the prevention of fertilization . ”
“ All of these methods , directly or indirectly , have effects on the endometrium [ the lining of the uterus ] that might prevent implantation of a fertilized ovum , ” the researchers acknowledge .
But as they quickly point out , “ So far , no scientific evidence has been published supporting this possibility . ”
There ’s just no evidence that any birth control method prevents a fertilized egg from attaching to the womb , even though that ’s the basis for the pro-life claims .
What ’s most striking about all this , is that , really , it should be a relief to pro-lifers .
Birth control does n’t have any effect on the egg once fertilized .
The primary and secondary ways in which these methods work should be completely acceptable by the pro-life movement .
In fact , though , they ’ve taken just the opposite stance .
Their argument usually sounds like this :
We ca n’t really know for sure that in some cases , however rare , a
fertilized egg is n’t kept from fulfilling its
God decreed destiny of implanting in the womb .
And the dutiful scientist , limited by the research facts , must acknowledge that though there is no evidence to suggest that such a thing happens , it ’s impossible to rule it out .
So there !
Says the pro-lifer .
It ca n’t be ruled out .
You ca n’t prove a negative .
It ’s a little bit like deriding gravity as a hypothesis .
Yes , the last ten times you dropped that spoon , it crashed down on the table .
But what about the eleventh time ?
Or the eleven hundredth ?
Or the eleven millionth ?
There is also know way of knowing how breast feeding works as a means of birth control , which it does in the exact way hormonal methods menitioned above do , or whether fertilized eggs to breast feeding women are prevented from implanting .
Applying the same exact standard here , pro-lifers would even be against the birth control method God designed .
They propagate “ education ” campaigns , with great vehemence and assuredness , about the “ abortifacient ” method of birth control — all this , because while there is no evidence to show these methods actually prevent implantation of a fertilized egg , there is also no evidence to show they do not .
“ Insufficient evidence exists on whether cellular or biological changes in the endometrium could actually prevent implantation , ” say the authors .
However , their point is that it does n’t matter .
“ The possibility of fertilization during combined oral contraceptive use is very small .
Hence , endometrial changes are unlikely to play an important role , if any , in the observed contraceptive effectiveness of combined oral contraceptives . ”
Thus pro-life campaigns against birth control are based not on scientific evidence , but rather on wishful thinking .
Indeed , on a slim hypothetical chance , the pro-life movement has successfully opposed legislation that would have provided millions of women access to effective birth control methods .
If the science is n’t on your side , then , the pro-life side seems to believe , ignore it .
Even some pro-life physicians , sparked by the recurring actions by the pro-life movement as a whole against birth control , stepped in to offer their medical views on the concerns their fellow pro-lifers raise .
In 1998 , twenty - two pro-life Ob / Gyns published an analysis entitled “ Birth Control Pills : Contraceptive or Abortifacients ? ” and four of these pro-life physicians followed up with a more detailed paper on hormonal
contraceptives in general .
The physicians open their statement boldly warning , “ Currently the claim that hormonal contraceptives [ birth control pills , implants ( norplant ) , injectables ( depoprovera ) ] include an abortifacient mechanism of action is being widely disseminated in the pro-life community .
This theory is emerging with the assumed status of “ scientific fact , ” and is causing significant confusion among both
lay and medical pro-life people .
With this confusion in the ranks comes a significant weakening of both our credibility with the general public and our effectiveness against the tide of elective abortion . ”
The authors explain that any effects on the uterine lining that the pro-life movement uses to support the claim that fertilized eggs are being prevented from implanting would be insignificant and has no role in the ability for a fertilized egg to implant .
Fertilized eggs are able to implant in much more hostile conditions than those resulting from the mode of action from the pill .
They report “ The presumption that implantation of a blastocyst is thwarted by “ hostile endometrium ” is contradicted by the “ pill pregnancies ” we as physicians see .
Pill company literature estimates 3 to 5 pregnancies per l00 women per year for pill users .
Many of these women take the “ pill ” an additional month or two before finding out they are pregnant .
These pregnancies generally progress with no more difficulty than non-pill pregnancies .
To our knowledge , there are no studies showing that the spontaneous abortion rate in these cases is any greater than in pregnancies with a “ friendly endometrium . ”
The pro-life physicians conclude that there is no evidence to support that the contraceptive methods in question act in the ways that would be unacceptable to the pro-life individual who
believes life begins at fertilization .
They state it as plainly as they can , “ the ‘ hormonal contraception is abortifacient ’ theory is not established scientific fact .
It is speculation , and the discussion presented here suggests it is error ” and continue “ if a family , weighing all the factors affecting their own circumstances , decides to use this modality , we are confident that they are not using an abortifacient . ”
Yet , their campaigns against birth control continue today with more intensity than even before this intervention from the most expert on the pro-life side .
Of course , arguing over inconvenient biological truths is , in many ways , besides the point when it comes to pro-life disenchantment with birth control .
Do n’t be
misled .
This fracas is not caused by a simple scientific misunderstanding .
Otherwise , they ’d rush to support birth control methods that do n’t ’ cause abortions , ’ even in their implausible view .
Like the diaphragm , condom , cervical cap , and spermicides .
But the pro-life forces are n’t on record anywhere in favor of methods that keep sperm and egg apart .
It appears impossible to find a single instance in which a pro-life group has anything good to say about any birth control method except natural family planning — a technique most notable for its high failure rate .
Remember , even the lowly condom disturbs them .
Although electronics are great , they are not immune to imperfections .
Just like we can injure ourselves and grow old , computers can do the same .
But is the problem something you can fix by taking it to a computer repair service or is it such a problem that it ’s better to just replace it ?
Deciding when it ’s time for a new laptop or a new computer is always one met with a flurry of emotions .
So , we ’re gonna help aid that decision of yours by telling you some signs that it ’s time for a new computer .
Repair or Replace ?
Before we jump into the signs , let ’s see if you need to repair your computer or you need to replace it .
First off , are you just now experiencing problems with your computer ?
If this issue is new and you have n’t had many before , then you ’re likely fine .
You ’ll just need to take your laptop to a computer repair service and they can help you fix it .
Signs You Need a New Computer
Now , if you ’re experiencing a consistent problem or problems , then you may be looking down a path that leads to a replacement .
But what are the signs ?
1. Booting Time
If you have a good , healthy computer then it should n’t take you very long to boot up or shut down your computer .
It should really only take about 6 - 10 seconds .
If it takes any longer than that , then it may time to replace .
This is likely caused by low memory space .
To increase memory space , you ’ll need to upgrade your RAM , but your computer can only support so much RAM .
If you need an excessive amount of RAM for your computer to function , you ’re going to be better off replacing it .
In addition to insufficient RAM upgrades , if any other upgrades to the system cost more than it would to purchase a new computer , then it ’s just not worth it .
This same mindset goes for repairs to your computer .
If you ’ve busted the screen or there ’s water damage that costs a fortune to repair , check to make sure if it ’s cheaper to repair or replace .
If you bought a warranty with your current computer , see if it ’s still active .
This will allow you to get your current computer fixed for free or for a greatly reduced cost which is great if you do n’t have the money to drop on a new computer or you ’re trying to save .
This is quite common in phones more than it is with computers .
If you ’ve had a device for so long , whether it be a phone or a computer , there comes a point in time where it can no longer support the newest software update .
When this happens , it ’s strictly because of old age .
While this may not seem like a problem at first , it will grow to be one .
You wo n’t get all of the benefits from the future software updates and it ’s just a warning sign that your computer is going to start rolling downhill .
So if this happens , a new computer is a must .
4. Too Slow
Taking forever to boot up or shut down is one thing , but when it takes ages to simply load a webpage or an application , that ’s another story .
It ’s time to get a new computer if it takes forever to open an application like Google Chrome or even a notes app .
It ’s even worse if it ’s accompanied by the spinning wheel of death .
Reasons for this slowness can be a lot of different things .
From something as simple as too many programs and applications running to bigger issues like malware and viruses .
Before you take it to a shop or you replace it , try to clean out your hard drive .
If this does n’t work and your computer is still running slow , applications are n’t opening , and you ca n’t have more than one application open at a time , then you need to buy a new laptop .
5. Constant Crashing
If a slow computer was bad , it ’s even worse if it constantly crashes .
You could be trying to open an application and while it ’s on its fifth minute of loading , the computer shuts down and restarts .
Sometimes it may even crash out of nowhere .
Many of the reasons for the constant crashing are similar to those of the slow computer .
You can always take it to a shop , but it ’s in your best interest to replace it .
6. Loud Fans and Hot Keys
Does your computer make a loud whirring noise when you run it ?
And with that noise does your computer get extremely hot to the touch ?
All computers have fans inside them that cool them down so they do n’t get too hot .
Over time , it ’s common that the fans inside get packed with dust , making to more difficult for them to properly ventilate the system .
If you get it cleaned or you clean it yourself and the problem still persists , then it ’s likely another issue with the fan .
You can of course still try to get it repaired , but it ’s likely that the cost to do so may be around the same price to replace it .
It ’s Time for a New Computer
When it ’s time for a new computer you should rejoice !
Having the newest and most up - to - date technology is a great opportunity and will enable you to perform your tasks the best that you can .

Prince Charles converts his beloved Aston Martin to a green machine ... run on English wine
It is certainly a vintage vehicle .
And now Prince Charles 's beloved Aston Martin DB6 is running on vintage too .
A nice little white from a vineyard in Wiltshire , to be precise .
As part of cutting his carbon footprint , the prince has converted the 38 - year - old classic car - a 21st birthday present from the Queen - to run on 100 per cent bioethanol fuel distilled from surplus British wine .
Drink and drive : Prince Charles has converted his 38 - year - old Aston Martin to run on bio-ethanol made from English wine
Aides said this was partly due to the pattern of Royal trips set by the Foreign Office .
He has now doubled the target to a 25 per cent fall in emissions by 2018 .
Converting the Aston Martin played a small but symbolic role .
The Prince 's chief aide Sir Michael Peat said : ' Charles only travelled two or three hundred miles a year in the Aston but he wanted it to be environmentally friendly .
It just happened that our bioethanol supplier makes the fuel from surplus English wine . '
The car - which is kept at Highgrove and clocks up just 300 miles a year - averages ten miles a gallon , the equivalent of 4.5 bottles of wine for every mile .
At £ 1.10 a litre , the bioethanol is only slightly cheaper than conventional petrol , but is estimated to produce 85 per cent less carbon dioxide .
The grapes used for Charles 's fuel have already been fermented into wine on an English vineyard near Swindon , Wiltshire .
Its owners bottle all they can , but cannot produce more than their EU quota .
Rather than destroy the excess , the vineyard now sells it to the Gloucestershire biofuels supplier Green Fuels , where it is distilled .
The green prince has also introduced a raft of environmentally - friendly measures at his homes , such as reed bed sewage systems and wood - chip boilers at Highgrove and Birkhall , his Scottish residence .
He even tries to have his cows fed on grass rather than grain - to cut their flatulence and minimise their emission of the greenhouse gas methane .
It just been a few days since Electronic Arts ’ Mythic Entertainment had sent word that half a million gamers had registered for their fantasy massively multiplayer online role playing game , Warhammer Online : Age of Reckoning .
Now Mythic has announces that number has risen to 750,000 .
Mark Jacobs is the co-founder and general manager of Mythic Entertainment .
He stated , “ Thanks to our players , the war between the Realms continues to escalate at an incredible pace .
The battlefields are alive with three quarters of a million players fighting for the forces of Order and Destruction in truly epic and unparalleled Realm vs. Realm battles ! ”
Just like last time , these players have registered from territories such as North America , Europe and the Oceanic regions .
Warhammer Online : Age of Reckoning is available for PC and comes with a price tag of $ 49.99 ( approx . Rs. 2420 ) .
The game is based on the well - liked Games Workshop tabletop war game .
Colorado city official cancels Al - Jazeera barbecue Associated Press
Published : Saturday August 23 , 2008
Print This Email This
The city manager of Golden , Colo. , has decided to withdraw his invitation to let the Al - Jazeera news network broadcast from a barbecue in his backyard on the final night of the Democratic National Convention .
City manager Mike Bestor has apologized for any divisiveness he caused in the city of about 18,000 , about 15 miles west of Denver .
Bestor made his decision after a City Council meeting Thursday at which residents complained the event with the English - language service of the Middle East news network would be disrespectful to veterans and active U.S. soldiers .
Al - Jazeera is based in Qatar and is funded by the royal family of the Persian Gulf nation .
The network says its English service reaches at least 100 million households worldwide .
Warren Buffett praised Goldman Sachs Berkshire Hathaway , the company owned by US investment guru Warren Buffett , has bought $ 5 bn ( £ 2.7bn ) worth of Goldman Sachs shares .
Mr Buffett , the world 's most famous investor , said Goldman was an " exceptional institution " .
Hit by the crisis that has engulfed other major US financial institutions , it was forced to change its status from an investment bank this week .
Goldman Sachs said the deal would bolster its finances .
Berkshire Hathaway is buying $ 5bn of preferred stock bearing a 10 % annual interest rate .
This is very expensive money for Goldman , not least because if it wants to buy Buffett out , it has to pay a 10 % premium
Robert Peston , BBC business editor
Read Robert 's thoughts in full
It could increase its holding of Goldman shares as , under the terms of the deal , it has the option of buying $ 5bn of common stock for $ 115 per share at any time in the next five years .
In addition , Goldman Sachs said it was raising at least $ 2.5 bn in common equity in a public offering .
Goldman said it was pleased that Warren Buffett had made such a significant investment .
" We view it as a strong validation of our client franchise and future prospects , " said chairman and chief executive Lloyd C Blankfein .
" This investment will further bolster our strong capitalisation and liquidity position . "
But BBC business editor Robert Peston rejected the notion that Warren Buffett 's move was a vote of confidence in the US investment banking system .
" He 's demanded and is receiving a lovely 10 % dividend , which means he views Goldman as a high - risk investment , " Mr Peston said .
" This is very expensive money for Goldman , not least because if it wants to buy Buffett out , it has to pay a 10 % premium . "

“ Some differences ” remain on the table , Mr. Frank said , but nothing in his choice of words or demeanor suggested that he viewed those differences as unbridgeable .
The discussions continue to be based on “ the core ” of the plan offered by the administration through Treasury Secretary Henry M. Paulson Jr. , Mr. Frank said .
The hopeful report from the Democrats came after President Bush appealed for urgent action , and lawmakers in both parties said they would continue to press for a swift deal .
But all were wrestling with realities imposed by presidential politics and the Congressional elections , which have led some legislators to see little political benefit in voting for the bailout .
Both parties were still trying to digest the ramifications of a remarkable uprising led by House Republicans , who said on Thursday that they could not support the administration ’s plan .
The Republicans have challenged the Democrats , who hold a majority in Congress , to approve the package on their own .
But Democrats say they need the White House to persuade reluctant Republicans in Mr. Bush ’s party to go along .
After Thursday ’s high political drama at the White House , Republicans sought to contain the disarray that led House members and Senator John McCain , the party ’s presidential nominee , to essentially scuttle the administration ’s $ 700 billion bailout plan .
While some Republican senators said they were close to a deal , others insisted it was not so .
Before flying to Mississippi for the first presidential debate , Mr. McCain met on Friday morning at the Capitol with the minority leader , Senator Mitch McConnell , and with House Republican leaders , who then installed Mr. Blunt of Missouri to replace Spencer Bachus of Alabama as their lead negotiator .

Videogame definition of " mature " :
Shits , tits and gibs .
What is adult ?
According to ratings boards and hand - wringing politicians , the only qualifications necessary are a bucket of blood , a stream of foul profanity and a parade of naughty lady parts .
Ironically , the very things that are included to win over immature teenage boys .
Read more : Marvel Ultimate Alliance 3 review : “ A charming co-op juggernaut ”
The following games , however , define adult in a different way .
They tackle challenging themes , explore intellectual ideas and deal with complex characters in complicated relationships .
They add shades of grey to an otherwise black - and - white form of entertainment .
Should little kids play Mass Effect ?
No , but not because they might catch a glimpse ofalien assor learn how to digitally stimulate their “ se ” xbox , as the media would have you believe .
The sci - fi epic simply was n’t designed for children and , as such , deals with many issues that children would n’t understand .
Racism is addressed , as Shepard navigates a minefield of prejudice , intolerance and segregation between the game ’s diverse species .
Foreign policy is debated , too , with humanity ’s brash and aggressive military actions earning both admiration and resentment across the universe .
Parallels can even be drawn between the current economic crisis and Mass Effect ’s main twist , both of which result from our choosing the path of willful ignorance and least resistance .
Morality , diplomacy , obedience , deception , death , love , and yes , sex – the list continues .
Like the best episodes of Star Trek , Mass Effect is about far , far more than spaceships and laser guns .
Rockstar ’s sandbox sagas are famous for being big .
The cities are big .
The missions are big .
The casts of characters are big .
Until recently , however , the ideas were not .
GTA IV changed everything .
While Tommy Vercetti and Carl Johnson showcased the “ American dream , ” working from hoodlums to kingpins , Niko Bellic discovered that life in the West is often no better , no easier and no more ethical than war in the East .
While his predecessors reveled in money , drugs and prostitutes , he found that material gains often require moral sacrifices .
And while Vice City and San Andreas boiled down to basic revenge tales , GTA IV exposed how the pursuit of payback was slowly eating away at Niko ’s soul .
Who knew the immigrant , so fresh off the boat , would come to understand our culture more insightfully than any protagonist before ?
Some of the most mature games are n't even rated “ Mature . "
Braid is legally appropriate for anyone over the age of 10 , as the fairytale visuals , soothing music and bouncing pint - sized hero give the impression of an old - school Nintendo platformer .
The subtext of this seemingly innocent quest , on the other hand , requires a bit of life experience to appreciate .
Just ask Soulja Boy .
In a kids ’ game , for instance , the ability to time travel might nab an extra life orbop an extra enemy .
In Braid , reversing the clock solves a series of mind - melting puzzles and , at the same time , symbolizes the haunting power of regret .
If the protagonist could try everything over again - correct his past mistakes - would the Princess return ?
Would she ever have left ?
If he could slow down the world , or lead two lives at once , would that somehow help reclaim her ?
We all wish we could erase our errors , or go back and try a different path in life , with the simple press of a button .
Braid capitalizes on this universal longing and , without spoiling the end , also preys on it .
The iPhone is a revolutionary handset .
But it is also the key to a virtual gold mine – the iTunes App Store , where independent developers can become multimillionaires in just a year .
Since its launch in July , the App Store has grown to become an indie developer 's dream come true .
Steve Demeter , developer of the vastly popular $ 5 iPhone game Trism , announced he made $ 250,000 in profit in just two months .
His team ?
Himself , mainly , with a little bit of help from a friend and a contracted designer ( whom he paid $ 500 ) .
If his profits continue at this rate , Demeter will earn nearly $ 2 million by July 2009 .
" I
really did n't think about the money , " Demeter said in a phone interview with Wired.com .
" I got an e-mail from a lady who 's like , a 50 - year - old woman who says , ' I do not play games , but I love Trism . '
That 's what I did it for . "
What 's more , Demeter initially released Trism as a free native application in the Jailbreak community – meaning it was a game that users could play only if they hacked their iPhones .
The prospects of making money were uncertain , but Demeter had a vision :
He knew iPhone apps would get big once Apple released a software developer kit to allow third - party apps on the handset , and he wanted to get in on the platform early .
Though Demeter 's success was fortuitous , he said he expects other applications to see similar numbers .
He said the factors that made Trism stand out were unique gameplay ( Trism is essentially a version of Bejeweled using the iPhone 's accelerometer ) , high replay value and an online leaderboard that creates community .
He said applications with great content will sell themselves , and that 's ultimately what other developers need to focus on , too .
In a sense , the App Store , despite its corporate ties , has created an open market where developers can strike it rich with minimal resources – even out of a garage – so long as they possess the talent and the time .
Bart Decrem , CEO of Tapulous , would agree .
His company 's free application Tap Tap Revenge , a music - rhythm game that utilizes the iPhone 's touch screen and accelerometer , hit a milestone of 1,000,000 downloads just two weeks after its launch .
As of this writing there are 1.75
million users who have downloaded Tap Tap Revenge , according to Decrem , and the company expects that number to grow to 2,000,000 by next week .
As for profits , Tapulous just recently began inserting advertisements in the game , and the company also has plans to release a premium version that will cost money .
Decrem was mum to disclose profit numbers , but Demeter estimates that any top iPhone app is making its company roughly $ 5,000 to $ 10,000 a day .
Decrem 's recipe for success with Tap Tap is similar to Trism's : Paying attention to detail ; keeping the app engaging and alive with various forms of gameplay ; and relying on those two factors to spread popularity with an old - fashioned marketing method – word of mouth .
Similar to * Trism , Tap
Tap Revenge * was also an app that initially emerged in the Jailbreak community , and it spawned a loyal following there before breaking out into the broader market with the launch of the App Store .
Decrem , whose initial team was only four people including himself , said he views the
App Store as an exciting new landscape , as opposed to today 's overcrowded world of dot -coms .
" I think it 's a very interesting space , and it 's very reminiscent of the early days of the web in terms of the amount of green fields and opportunity , " Decrem said in a phone interview .
" You really do n't need a huge amount of capital .
You need attention to detail and product , and that 's going to keep increasing . "
Not all App Store success stories started out with the iPhone in mind .
Design by a Knife CEO Austin Sarner 's story is a bit different from Demeter 's and Decrem's .
Sarner built his reputation as a coder who had developed popular Mac applications in the past : App
Zapper and Disco .
He did n't even think about developing an iPhone app until much later in the game , he says .
Good thing he did : Sarner 's $ 3 application , Pennies , a budgeting tool , was the 12th most popular in the App Store at one point .
Sarner echoes the idea that great content – not marketing – is what drives App Store success .
" You can come up with a generic idea , but implement it properly and you really are going to stand out , " Sarner said in a phone interview .
" Basically everybody 's on the same level once they submit an iPhone app .
Unlike traditional marketing , there 's no ad campaign : A user just sees what he sees in the iPhone store , and the applications kind of have to sell themselves to some extent . "
All three of these developers – big fish in a small pond , if you will – have plans for future iPhone applications as well .
" I
have a sense of a bigger picture , " Demeter said .
" The community that has spread within * Trism – * the amount of people that use forum accounts and create a sense of community – I want to keep making great games , games people want to play . "
Updated : 11 a.m. , Sept. 23 : Demeter provided documentation to Wired.com confirming his earnings .

夏休みの思い出作りはお金をかければ作れるわけではない。子供たちが普段体験していない遊びを教えて一緒に楽しむという方法もある――ということで始まった、ビジネスパーソンのための「子供と遊ぼう」講座。準備も整えた今回は、紙飛行機を作って遊んでみよう。
紙飛行機のちょっとしたコツ
紙飛行機を折ること自体は、新聞紙とチラシのどっちでもできる。だが、紙飛行機が地面に落ちると衝撃で紙が曲がってしまうので、少し固めのチラシを選ぶといい。
また、力いっぱい投げてもだめだ。むやみやたら投げてもうまく飛んでくれない。紙飛行機を上手に飛ばすには多少コツが必要なのである。筆者が子供の頃に身に付けた飛ばし方の5のコツを紹介しよう。
力いっぱい投げない。 機体を前に押し出すような感覚で投げる。 水平よりも少し目線を上にして、その方向に投げる 機体の重心より少し前部分を持って投げる。 決して人に向かって投げない 。
ひ と口に紙飛行機といっても、いろんな飛行機を作れるし、同じ飛行機でも飛ばし方によって距離や滞空時間が違ってくる。子供と一緒にいろいろ試してみてほしい。
飛行機を折るための共通の折り方 基本的にはチラシを二つ折りにし、真ん中が分かるように折れ線を付ける。その線に向かって両角を折り曲げて、縦長の五角形を作るイメージだ。
見開きの新聞紙を二つ折りにして
いったん開いて折れ線に向かって折り曲げる。この五角形が基本パターンだ

An old - fashioned Lancashire corner shop and ice cream parlour has been discovered untouched for 40 years .
Council officers went to the boarded - up premises on Burnley Road , Accrington , after fears about its safety .
But when they got inside they discovered original cigarette adverts , magazines , ice cream spoons and sweet jars as they were left when owners moved out an estimated 40 years ago .
A council spokesman said : " It was like walking back in time - a treasure trove .
It should be kept as a living museum .
" The old white - tiled ice cream area is near perfect but there are problems with safety at the rear of the property . "
A culture of neglect and , at some age levels , outright social ostracism , is derailing a generation of students , especially girls , deemed the very best in mathematics , according to a new study .
In a report published today ( Oct. 10 ) in the Notices of the American Mathematical Society , a comprehensive analysis of decades of data on students identified as having profound ability in math describes a culturally constricted pipeline that puts American leadership in the mathematical sciences and related fields at risk .
According to the report , many girls with extremely high aptitude for math exist , but they are rarely identified in the U.S. because they veer from a career trajectory in the mathematical sciences due to the low respect American culture places on math , systemic flaws in the U.S. public school education system , and a lack of role models .
" The U.S. culture that is discouraging girls is also discouraging boys , " says Janet Mertz , a University of Wisconsin - Madison professor of oncology and the senior author of the study .
" The situation is becoming urgent .
The data show that a majority of the top young mathematicians in this country were not born here . "
Joseph A. Gallian , a co-author of the report , a professor of mathematics at the University of Minnesota , Duluth , and current president of the Mathematical Association of America , says , " Just as there is concern about the U.S. relying on foreign countries for our oil and manufactured goods , we should also be concerned about relying on others to fill our needs for mathematicians , engineers and scientists . "
Mertz and Gallian conducted the analysis with Jonathan Kane , a professor of mathematics and computer science at the University of Wisconsin - Whitewater involved with math competitions , and Titu Andreescu , a professor of mathematics education at the University of Texas at Dallas .
Andreescu is a former leader of the U.S. International Mathematical Olympiad team and director of AwesomeMath , a summer program for mathematically gifted children .
The new study draws on decades of data from extremely difficult mathematics competitions aimed at the most elite student math performers , including the collegiate William Lowell Putnam Mathematics Competition and the pre-collegiate International and U.S.A. Mathematical Olympiads .
Mining the data , Mertz and her colleagues found :
Contrary to the myth that females lack the intrinsic aptitude needed to excel in mathematics at the highest level , an idea proffered most famously by former Harvard University President Lawrence Summers , many girls exist with truly exceptional talent for mathematics .
Girls as well as boys with such talent are frequently identified and nurtured in some countries where this ability is highly valued ; in the U.S. , such talent is routinely overlooked or ignored , with many American boys and girls feeling they are actively discouraged from excelling in math .
American children of immigrants from countries where math talent is highly valued — notably Eastern Europeans and Asians — are much more likely to be identified as possessing extraordinary mathematical ability .
The pipeline for nurturing top math talent in the U.S. is badly broken beginning at the middle school level .
Eighty percent of female and 60 percent of male faculty hired in recent years by the very top U.S. research university mathematics departments were born in other countries .
" We show , " the group reports , " that many girls exist who possess extremely high aptitude for mathematical problem solving .
The frequency with which they are identified is due , at least in part , to a variety of socio-cultural , educational or other environmental factors that differ significantly among countries and ethnic groups and can change over time . "
When raised in some environments , girls were found to be 11 - 24 percent of the children identified as having profound mathematical ability ; when raised in others , girls , including U.S. - born white ones , were 30 - fold or more underrepresented .
Andreescu believes that , " Innate math aptitude is probably fairly evenly distributed throughout the world , regardless of race or gender .
The huge differences observed in achievement levels are most likely due to socio-cultural attributes specific to each country . "
" We are wasting this valuable resource , " says Mertz .
" Girls can excel in math at the very highest level .
There are some truly phenomenal women mathematicians out there . "
In elementary school , girls do as well as or better in math than boys .
In middle school , Mertz and her colleagues suggest , girls with an inclination for math begin to lose interest and fall behind , mostly due to peer pressure and societal expectations .
Throughout middle and high school , social stigma and lack of appropriately challenging educational opportunities for the mathematically precocious becomes a hard reality in most American schools .
Consequently , gifted girls , even more so than boys , often camouflage their mathematical talent to fit in well with their peers .
In the future " flat world , " the U.S. may no longer be able to depend upon hiring foreign workers to fill its jobs in the mathematical sciences and related fields .
The report suggests that the economic well - being of the U.S. is at risk , and that it is crucial that steps be taken now to correct this problem .
A good start , say Mertz and her colleagues , would include implementing the recommendations of the National Mathematics Advisory Panel and fully funding the America COMPETES , " 10,000 Teachers , 10 Million Minds " and Sowing the Seeds through Science and Engineering Research Acts already passed by the U.S. Congress .

As a car accelerates up and down a hill then slows to follow a hairpin turn , the airflow around it cannot keep up and detaches from the vehicle .
This aerodynamic separation creates additional drag that slows the car and forces the engine to work harder .
The same phenomenon affects airplanes , boats , submarines , and even your golf ball .
Now , in work that could lead to ways of controlling the effect with potential impacts on fuel efficiency and more , MIT scientists and colleagues have reported new mathematical and experimental work for predicting where that aerodynamic separation will occur .
The research solves " a century - old problem in the field of fluid mechanics , " or the study of how fluids -- which for scientists include gases and liquids -- move , said George Haller , a visiting professor in the Department of Mechanical Engineering .
Haller 's group developed the new theory , while Thomas Peacock , the Atlantic Richfield Career Development Associate Professor in the same department , led the experimental effort .
Papers on the experiments and theory are being published in the Sept. 25 issue of the Journal of Fluid Mechanics and in the September issue of Physics of Fluids , respectively .
Fluid flows affect everything in our world , from blood flow to geophysical convection .
As a result , engineers constantly seek ways of controlling separation in those flows to reduce losses and increase efficiency .
One recent accomplishment : the sleek , full - body swimsuits used at the Beijing Olympics .
Controlling fluid flows lies at the heart of a wide range of scientific problems , including improving the performance of vehicles , Peacock said .
For example , picture air flowing around , over and past an object .
" Instead of flowing smoothly past the object , the air tends to dramatically part from the surface , or separate , " said Peacock .
Like the wake behind a boat , the water does n't automatically reconfigure into a single stream .
Rather , the region is quite turbulent .
" And that adversely affects the lift [ or vertical forces ] and drag [ or horizontal forces ] of the object . "
In 1904 , Ludwig Prandtl derived the exact mathematical conditions for flow separation to occur .
But his work had two major restrictions : first , it applied only to steady flows , such as those around a car moving at a constant low speed .
Second , it only applied to idealized two - dimensional flows .
" Most engineering systems , however , are unsteady .
Conditions are constantly changing , " Haller said .
" For example , cars accelerate and decelerate , as do planes during maneuvers , takeoff and landing .
Furthermore , fluids of technological interest really flow in our three - dimensional world , " he added .
As a result , ever since 1904 there have been intense efforts to extend Prandtl 's results to real - life problems , i.e. , to unsteady three - dimensional flows .
A century later , Haller led a group that did just that .
In 2004 Haller published his first paper in the Journal of Fluid Mechanics explaining the mathematics behind unsteady separation in two dimensions .
This month , his team reports completing the theory by extending it to three dimensions .
Haller 's coauthors are Amit Surana , now at United Technologies ; MIT student Oliver Grunberg ; and Gustaaf Jacobs , now on the faculty at San Diego State University .
Equally important , this month Peacock and colleagues report important experimental work .
Said Peacock , " while we fully trust George 's new mathematical results , the engineering community is usually skeptical until they also see experimental results . "
Haller added , " while giving a beautiful validation of the 2D theory , Tom 's work also gives strong experimental backing to our new 3D theory . "
Coauthors on the experimental work are Haller , Jacobs , Matthew Weldon , now at Penn State ; and Moneer Helu , now at the University of California at Berkeley .
The research was initially supported by an internal source , the MIT Ferry Fund .
Currently the work is supported by the Air Force Office of Scientific Research and the National Science Foundation .
The researchers said it 's too soon to quantify the level of improvement in performanceÂ of cars and planes that might stem from the work , noting that more work must be done before it can be applied to commercial technologies .
" This is the tip of the iceberg , but we 've shown that this theory works , " Peacock said .

Intel and Dreamworks SKG made a joint announcement yesterday naming Intel as the movie studio's premier solution provider going forward .
This new deal replaces a previous ( and expired ) three - year contract AMD signed with Dreamworks back in 2005 .
It 's unclear what impact the loss of Dreamworks SKG 's patronage will have on AMD 's bottom line , but such arrangements are potent PR for any company attempting to prove ( or maintain ) that it 's products are a match for the competition .
Unfortunately for AMD , current Phenom / Barcelona products simply are n't up to the task .
Back in 2005 , the AMD / Dreamworks contract was hailed as both a triumph for the company and as further proof that the then - fledgling x86 - 64 technology push delivered real benefits .
Fast forward to the present - day , however , and the two companies have flip - flopped .
Now , AMD is the manufacturer struggling to deliver a competitive product , while Intel is capable of delivering quad - core Yorkfield processors today , Nehalem at the end of the year , and Larrabee in the not - too - distant future .
Dreamworks cited both Larrabee and Nehalem in particular when discussing its decision to move to Intel - based production platforms , as well as a need for more powerful CPU 's in general that the movie studio feels will be best accomplished with Intel processors .
This is not to say that Dreamworks and AMD have completely called it quits .
Dreamworks owns a number of rendering farms ( with up to 5,000 cores in a farm ) , and the company obviously wo n't simply shovel all its AMD hardware out the door when the first shipments of HP - built Intel systems roll up .
Depending on the type of systems Dreamworks previously deployed , AMD might actually still see a fair bit of business from the company ; Socket F ( 1207 ) systems that initially shipped with 90nm dual - core Opterons should be capable of using Barcelona or Shanghai processors .
Dreamworks has not announced any AMD - centric upgrade plans , but a solid Shanghai debut in six months could make this option particularly compelling .
Software optimizations play critical role
Dreamworks ' decision to switch CPU vendors is not entirely driven by Intel 's roadmap .
According to the president of production at Dreamworks Animations , John Batter , Intel is also assisting the studio with animation software development .
" Our animation tools are all proprietary here , " Batter said .
" Intel is rearchitecting our software tools ... to take advantage of multicore and make our renderer highly scalable as well as making our character animation tools highly scalable . "
That 's the sort of offer AMD would have a hard time competing against , no matter how strong the company 's product line was , and it highlights a key disparity between the two CPU manufacturers .
Intel is often capable of offering incentives ( financial or otherwise ) , that AMD can't match , even when the company is firing on all cylinders .
In this case , the battle is particularly important .
Going forward , Intel will deploy an advanced , next - generation set of vector instructions the company is calling AVX ( Advanced Vector Extensions ) .
AMD , meanwhile , intends to deploy its own vector - extension SIMD , under the moniker of SSE5 .
Both are meant for HPC and high - end graphics computation , but the two SIMD instruction sets will not be compatible with each other .
AMD must think it has a chance to push its own SSE5 into the market , but Dreamworks ' decision to go Intel ( and accept their assistance in software optimization ) could lock AMD out of that contract long - term , or at least make reacquiring it substantially more difficult .
If Intel and AVX deliver a performance level that AMD can't match without the use of SSE5 , and all of Dreamworks ' animation tools are optimized for AVX , well , why rearchitect for an entirely different set of vector instructions when there 's no performance advantage to doing so ?
It 's a canny move for Intel , and it could signal a return to the Bad Old Days of SSE vs. 3DNow ! in years to come .
Book Review : F# for Scientists
F# for Scientists ( author , publisher , Amazon ) is a new book by British author Dr. Jon D. Harrop , who is the principal at Flying Frog Consultancy and a key player in the small - but - growing F# universe .
I just finished reading it .
First , a little about my background : I ’ve got very little practical exposure to functional programming .
I ’ve been working with imperative languages ( C++ , VB , C# ) almost exclusively in my 15 - year programming career .
And no , I do n’t consider Func < T , T > to be good experience working in a functional paradigm .
I picked up the book because I wanted to learn something new , yet I wanted to avoid the horrid syntax I see in many other pure - functional languages .
F# seems like a good segue from C# – even though they are n’t born of the same mother , they both work well in the .NET universe , and the tools are familiar .
About the book .
This is an extremely clear and well - written text .
Sections are ( mostly ) brief , and explanations are well thought out .
Each chapter builds upon the previous work , and one is never cast adrift without landmarks .
These are all hallmarks of a smart author , and excellent editor , or both .
Dr. Harrop obviously brings a lot of expertise to the table .
I gather he ’s had a long history with OCaml , from which F# took most of its inspiration .
In addition to programming expertise , he ’s obviously comfortable with scientific applications and a good chunk of the book is specifically focused on these applications ( hence the title ! ) .
This was useful – it helped to have concrete problems to solve as I worked through the unfamiliar F# syntax .
I ’m sort of a math - head so the domain is naturally interesting .
What did n’t work for me ?
Well , in the first place , I would have liked more background , or perhaps a series of different perspectives , on the advantages of functional programming .
Recursion is easy in F#. I get that .
I would have appreciated a more thorough analysis of the topic , but perhaps that was too far afield from the main theme of the book .
Second , the brevity of the sections worked wonders for clarity , but perhaps worked against comprehension .
One of the neat things about functional programming is the subtle elegance of the constructs – it ’s not a hit - you - over - the - head , write - programs - when - you ’re - hungover type of language .
Some of the more slippery concepts deserved a more thorough airing .
Pipelining , for one .
Composition of functions .
More theory on maps and folds .
Anonymous functions .
Accumulators .
Overall ?
Very glad to have purchased the book , and I ’ll refer back to it often for the clear examples .
However , I need to supplement my education with a separate book that fills in the theoretical / perspective gaps I ’ve mentioned .
The Mathematical Study of Mollusk Shells
1. Terminal growth and unchanging form
" But the shell retains its unchanging form in spite of itsassymetrical growth ; it grows at one end only ... .
And this remarkable property of increasing by terminal growth , but nevertheless retaining unchanged the form of the entire figure , is characteristic of the equiangular spiral , and of no other mathematical curve . "
- Sir D'Arcy Wentworth Thompson , On Growth and Form
1942 edition , Cambridge University Press , p. 758 .
D'Arcy Thompson is referring to a phenomenon which everyone has observed but not everyone has pondered .
The shell of a small snail is identical to the shell of a larger one of the same species , except for its size .
One is an exact scale model of the other .
But a snail does not enlarge its shell by uniform expansion .
It adds onto it only at the open end ( " terminal growth " ) .
And it does so in such a way that the new shell is an exact scale - up of the old ( " unchanging form " ) .
The combination of constraints has a mathematical consequence .
Almost all mollusk shells , in all their rich variety of form , must follow the general plan of an equiangular ( or , " logarithmic " ) spiral , or of one of its three - dimensional cousins .
The exceptions include both living and fossil species of Vermicularia and fossil ammonites of the genus Didymoceras .
In this column we will see where the equiangular spirals come into the picture , and how they can be used to generate the underlying geometry of almost every mollusk shell .

AFTER a lecture to the Marine Memorial Association last week , a reporter thrust a mike toward me and asked if I thought I should be tried for war crimes for my columns in The Post supporting our military .
The reporter – who avoided revealing what outlet he was with – thought he was being wonderfully clever , but what fascinated me about the silly encounter ( it was in San Francisco , after all ) was how unintentionally revealing it was about the shameless hypocrisy of the left .
Think about it :
For expressing my views to readers like you on these pages , hardcore leftists believe I should be put on trial as a war criminal .
It tells you all you need to know about the extreme left ’s view of the First Amendment :
Free speech is great , as long as it ’s their free speech ( or extreme pornography ) .
But dissenting views must be censored .
The more effective the opponent , the more important it is to shut him down .
The extreme left loves to pretend it stands for freedom .
It never has and never will .
From the Reign of Terror in Paris onward , its core agenda has been the tyranny of egomaniacal intellectuals .
The hard left hates an open debate – especially these days , when it ’s out of new ideas .
The left pretends that campuses should enjoy freedom of speech , yet activist students shout down , harass and even attack speakers whose views they dislike .
That ’s brownshirt behavior , folks – as surely as show trials are Stalinist .
Hardcore leftists never welcome a freewheeling debate – they ’d rather force their beliefs on the rest of us .
It ’s an article of faith for the left that folks like you and me are too stupid to know what ’s good for us ( we ’re so dumb , some of us even believe in God ) .
For many years , the left ’s tactic was to pretend to care about average citizens .
In the last century , the motto was the “ dictatorship of the proletariat ” ( still a dictatorship , of course ) .
Then , when American workers showed no interest in the Sovietization of Michigan , outraged leftists retreated into the Dictatorship of the Intellectuals .
Now we have the would - be dictatorship of the pseudo - intellectuals .
The stunning hypocrisy of the march - in - step left was brought home to me again on Sunday while I waited in a green room for a C - Span spot .
The show preceding mine featured a young woman , Mahvish Rukhsana Khan , who ’s published a book about the poor , innocent , kitten - loving prisoners at Guantanamo .
Her interview climaxed with the claim that Guantanamo is the equivalent of the Holocaust .
I guarantee you that no one from MoveOn or DailyKos questioned that outrageous comparison .
( Nor did the patsy interviewer challenge it . )
The Holocaust ’s victims were 6 million innocents .
The handful of prisoners at Guantanamo are accused terrorists .
Guantanamo has no gas chambers ; prisoners are n’t forced into slave labor .
They are n’t tortured or starved or shot .
And their trials are open to members of the press .
The truly outrageous aspect of such comparisons is that the American left , with its Stalin - redux willingness to rearrange history , neglects to mention that , outside of Japan , all of the 20th century ’s great totalitarian regimes had roots on the political left .
It was n’t just Lenin and Stalin whose propaganda machine prefigured MoveOn .
Nazi is an acronym for “ National Socialist . ” Read Mein Kampf .
It is n’t a tribute to free - market capitalism , folks .
Mussolini was a populist .
Mao was a leftist , as was Pol Pot .
The last century ’s worst censors and book burners all emerged from leftist ideologies .
At the moment , the American left evokes our Communists in 1939 , who contorted themselves to justify the Molotov - Ribbentrop Pact between Stalin and Hitler .
As this column recently pointed out , Support Our Troops , Bring Them Home !
disappeared from the political scene the instant Obama called for sending those troops to Afghanistan and Pakistan , instead of back to Fort Hood .
For the hardcore left , the party line always trumps conscience .
MoveOn is n’t new – it ’s just Pravda with poor punctuation .
The more I think about that proposed war - crimes trial , the more excited I get .
If we could just delay it until President Obama invades Pakistan , he and I could share the prisoners ’ docket together .
Of course , the charges he ’d face would be far worse , given that Saddam Hussein was a genocidal dictator and Pakistan ’s a democracy .
But the left is right :
We ca n’t let war crimes go unpunished .

A classified FBI intelligence memorandum gives police detailed instructions on how to target and monitor lawful political demonstrations under the rubric of fighting terrorism .
And the Joint Terrorism Task Force was involved in infiltrating , tracking and disrupting every - day Americans who disagree with the current administration ’s policies .
While the ACLU calls such tactics “ a return to the days of J. Edgar Hoover ’s spying tactics ” , that is not an accurate description .
While Hoover ’s FBI had its “ enemies list ” , and carried out numerous dirty tricks including Cointelpro , the current governmental actions are a lot worse .
For example , according to a law school professor , the Military Commissions Act of 2006 has the following consequences :
“ Anyone who donates money to a charity that turns up on Bush ’s list of ‘ terrorist ’ organizations , or who speaks out against the government ’s policies could be declared an ‘ unlawful enemy combatant ’ and imprisoned indefinitely .
That includes American citizens . ”
( Article continues below )
According to the New York Times :
“ A dangerously broad definition of “ illegal enemy combatant ” in the bill could subject legal residents of the United States , as well as foreign citizens living in their own countries , to summary arrest and indefinite detention with no hope of appeal .
The president could give the power to apply this label to anyone he wanted . ”
And according to a Yale law professor , “ The [ torture ] legislation ….authorizes the president to seize American citizens as enemy combatants , even if they have never left the United States .
And once thrown into military prison , they cannot expect a trial by their peers or any other of the normal protections of the Bill of Rights . ”
After they disappear into the black hole of enemy combatant status , they may , of course , also be tortured .
See also this FBI memo showing that peace protesters are being labeled as “ terrorists ” ( and see this ) .
Is that why mass arrest facilities were set up for the Democratic National Convention , and signs on the walls of the warehouse read “ Warning !
Electric stun devices used in this facility ” ( and see this ) ?
Remember , the Department of Homeland Security – instead of protecting vulnerable targets from alleged terror threats – has instead randomly made up lists which include kangaroo centers , petting zoos and ice cream parlors as high - priority terrorist threats .
The fact that they are now targeting reporters , children , little old ladies and skinny vegetarians is just more proof that the “ war on terror ” has nothing to do with terror , and everything to do with grabbing power and stifling dissent .

What does the rest of the world know that we do n't ?
The United States Dollar is dead .
While we are being jerked around by the mainstream media here at home , the rest of the world has already drawn the final conclusion for us , and what they are saying about us is n't pretty .
We are in the middle of a crisis much larger than most Americans could imagine , a portion of America can't even handle it , for that matter .
The Bailout is an awful idea , and the majority of Americans realize that .
There is even a provision that would grant Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson dictatorial powers , and that is obviously insane , but here we are debating it .
It 's like asking a dead man whether he wants to be buried or cremated ; it 's a non issue and Congress is just playing a game to distract the American people .
We need to move ahead , and we should begin with taking our country back from the tyrants .
Hank Paulson has already taken control of the US banking system ; journalist and expert economist Max Keiser compares Paulson to the 9/11 hijackers , calling him a financial terrorist .
Keiser has been making his rounds on international broadcasts , including France 24 and Press TV where he compares the collapse of the US banking system to WTC 7 - " a controlled demolition . "
Our news is being filtered and the rest of the world is ready to write us off .
China has asked domestic banks to stop lending to U.S. financial institutions to prevent losses .
America has relied on borrowing money from foreign lenders , and China was one of the largest .
We have put ourselves in debt to China , and now they have cut us off .
Meanwhile , the President of the United States is trying to scare the American people , threatening : support the Bailout or face more bank failures and a stock market crash ; 401Ks will evaporate ; home prices will plummet and foreclosures will rise .
Sadly we face all of these things plus much worse , with or without the bailout , and our president is deceiving us and he 's being aided by the media .
During his speech on Wednesday , Bush claimed to have been informed by , " The government 's top economic experts " and they are warning us , " without immediate action ... America could slip into a financial panic and a distressing scenario would unfold . "
These experts are the same ones that led us to this economic crisis .
Many have been predicting this collapse for years .
Let 's listen to some other economists .
Yesterday Senator Shelby , ranking Republican on the U.S. Senate Committee on Banking , Housing and Urban Affairs , met with the President and brought with him a 5 page list of the nation 's leading economists , who do not agree with the Bailout Proposal and have offered alternatives .
The answer , for men , would seem to be castration .
Better than drink : it takes away both performance and desire .
Plato , in The Republic , has Sophocles say that the end of sexual yearning is like escaping from a vicious tyrant , usually quoted as " being unchained from a lunatic " .
Visions of the madman vary ; I always picture him naked , wild - haired and bearded , a bit like Terry Jones in Monty Python , capering and scampering into the distance across a rain - swept Clapham Common .
The writer Guy Kennaway , in his memoir Sunbathing Naked , writes : " The chain broke , and I was the madman . "
Better have them off .
A couple of half - bricks , a moment 's exquisite agony and then peace descends .
Because when it comes to desire , we only have two choices now , here in the West at the beginning of the third millennium AD : we 're madmen , or we 're history .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
And if we 're madmen , we 're one of two sorts : buffoons or psychotics .
Men 's desire , emotional or sexual , must either mimic women's or be classed as deviant , probably deliberately so .
No self - control .
Evil instincts .
Clumsy .
Emotionally inarticulate .
Weak .
Predatory .
A perve .
Let 's take my own case .
I truly believe that the peak of nubility for a woman is around the age of 12 or 13 .
I believe that a pubescent boy can only be honoured , and learn from , the erotic attentions of an older man .
I believe that it is the natural duty of a woman to serve the sexual needs of her man , and that she must never refuse ; if she does , out she goes .
As for her own feelings ...
I believe that a normal woman is little troubled by sexual feelings of any kind ; her desires focus upon looking after her man and caring for his children and otherwise just keeping quiet .
I can't see what the fuss over prostitutes is all about .
I believe that a man is quite entitled to keep a mistress providing that he chooses a social inferior within his financial means and , when he tires of her , helps her find a husband of her own class .
I believe that black women are libidinous and immoral .
I believe that one of the duties of my female staff is to accommodate my sexual urges whenever required .
And I believe that a grown man who allows himself to be buggered is as much of a criminal pervert as one who performs cunnilingus .
And I know nobody who disagrees .
Or , at least , I would have believed all these things had I been born into different societies at different times in history .
The existence of sexual and erotic desire is a given ; but what it points itself towards seems almost entirely cultural .
It 's a mystery , to be honest .
Our Renaissance forebears thought nothing of taking a 12 - year - old wife , and it did n't occur to their neighbours to dob them in , beat them , bang them up , chip the sods , deport them , make them sign the sex offenders ' register and plaster their faces all over the tabloids ( " Leering Gary " , though the " leer " was the rictus common to all terrified anthropoids ) .
The gentlemen of classical Athens valourised pederasty .
Rich men had ceramic jugs , cups and punchbowls decorated , at vast expense , with picture of middle - aged men and beardless ( the beardlessness was crucial ) " beautiful boys " ; Plato ( again ) named homosexuality as the highest desire in one episode of the Symposium , yet would have been repelled by the civil partnerships ( with adopted children ) that we now applaud ( despite the fact that just over 40 years ago , the same men would have been put in prison ) .
And those same classical Athenians , as their symposium drew to a close , would have called for the euphemistically named " flute - girls " , or tottered off to an expensive hetaira , or perhaps humped the slavey in the peristyle .
Romans in their bath - houses bathed promiscuously , and more , and our very word " fornication " comes from the fornices – the arches – of the amphitheatre where low - rent prostitutes plied their trades ; the Victorian gentleman - artists who painted them so lovingly also had an eye for a tart , a shop - girl or a pubescent , not to mention the cult of " passionate friendship " with the inevitable mental images of entangled bushy beards and twanging sock - suspenders .
Slave - owning Americans extolled the compliancy and enthusiasm of their female property ( and , in a curious reversal , contemporary American pornography has a minor obsession with depicting white men watching their wives being transported to bliss by the superior powers and sensual vigour of black men : Google " cuckold " and see for yourself ) .
On it goes ... and the curious thing is that , to our imagination now , so much of it seems horrid .
Yet it can't have seemed horrid to them ( though there must have been the odd Athenian gentleman who had to grit his teeth to get through the awful pederasty business , and the odd one whose heart sank as the bloody flute - girls appeared just when he wanted to go home to bed ) or they would n't have done it , let alone made it into the normal , the done thing .
You have to conclude that while our sexual and erotic ( they 're different , of course ) urges are instinctive , their manifestations are as much a matter of time , place and custom as what we eat or how we dress .
If everyone else is doing it , one would be a fool to do otherwise .
And any sexual behaviour , for men at least , with our relatively easy route to orgasm , is going to be reinforced by pretty powerful rewards .
Yet now we are not guilty until proven innocent , but guilty .
Academic tutors are given little lectures on how they must n't ever let their eyes drop below their students ' collarbones , while the 20 - year - old woman who faces her , let 's say , 30 - year - old tutor in a short skirt , plunging neckline , and no underwear ( it has happened , and not infrequently ) is an innocent victim who will yell the place down if his glance flickers .
A friend of mine , at the top of his profession , had to resign because after a couple of drinks over the eight , he flattered a junior colleague on her appearance ( " leching " ) .
Not only are our desires wrong , they are also risible .
To start at the bottom of the moral chain , in a trade which knows precisely what people want , a porn film of a woman masturbating is considered both erotic and inherently beautiful ; a man wanking is risible and vile , conjuring images of the unsprung sofa , the scattered pizza cartons , the solitary sock for afterwards .
Almost every woman knows what it is to be desired , in a way that hardly any men ever do .
I remember talking to the actress Kathleen Turner about this ; on a good day , she said , she knew she could have nine out of 10 men in the room .
I pointed out that there are only a few men who could say that , on a good day , they could have one out 10 women .
And , of course , most of them are gay , and do n't want to have any .
The rest of us are just ... baggage .
Young men now seem to have reached a sort of affable affectionate ease with women that escaped earlier generations .
They share beds happily and chastely .
They are best friends .
They talk about their feelings .
But lust and libido and passion seem strangely absent .
They 're dreadfully held - in - check , and prey to the body dysmorphias that for so long in the Age of the Image have victimised women .
They go to the gym endlessly ; they buy magazines devoted to the abdominal muscles ; they gel and tan and sack - back - and - crack , vogue and pose , fret and pump iron , eat cabbage leaves and nibble on dry biscuits ... but unlike women , who hope that this horror will end with them being desired , the young men just hope , I suspect , to be forgiven .
If they can make themselves nice enough , in a parody of manual - labour masculinity plus beauty - salon pubescence ( body hair a no - no ) , it might not be so terrible that , at the end of it all , they are still men .
But how do you get to be a man now ?
Not by submitting to the embraces of an old dude round the back of the Temple of Hephaistos , for sure , nor by going off and tupping the nubile ancilla .
You get to be a man ( if you get to be one at all ) by acquiring the " virtues " of fidelity , emotional articulacy , sexual discrimination and social co-operating .
In other words , you get to be a man by imitating a woman , except with a six - pack .
But no body hair .
You do this because , first , the social roles for the " manly " man have faded with our manufacturing economy .
It does n't require courage or physical strength to poke at a computer screen , which is what most work ( and much flirtation ) now consists of .
Aggression and decisiveness count for nothing in a call centre ( or at least , not decisiveness ) .
And you do this , secondly , because masculinity is evil and the phallus – once a symbol of fertility , fun and good fortune – has become a lethal , corrupt and infecting agent of violence .
The phallus ravages children .
The phallus injects HIV .
The phallus , if uncalled for , destroys lives , and never mind how .
It injects children who must be borne and nurtured by lone , unsupported women .
And – Sophocles 's vicious tyrant – it drags its possessors ( or its slaves ) about the place , heartlessly .
Gray Joliffe 's Wicked Willy cartoons about sum it up ; except , unlike Joliffe 's affable , happy little chap , the real thing is vicious and unheeding .
A madman .
Any man , then , is a sort of zombie with a loaded revolver .
Lock up your wives , your daughters , your sons .
Lock up the dog .
There may be a man about .
Yet the idea of a man as an imitation woman ignores some fundamental truths .
First , that , like any culture , we get the sexuality we deserve .
Second , and more importantly , women and men are fulfilling , above all , their evolutionary destiny .
Social Darwinism is a horror , but you can say , for sure , that if you 're going to evolve an intelligent , sexually reproducing species , the first damn thing you have to evolve is sex .
EQ , compassion , quadratic equations and sushi come later ; or , if you fail to evolve sex , they do n't come at all .
The bit of us that has sex is n't the bit of us that thinks , and behind every bishop raving about homosexuality is not only a bishop who has n't noticed that Jesus says damn - all about sex ( and when he does mention it , it 's to go against Mosaic law ) , nor only a bishop who has too much time on his hands , but a bishop who is both culturally and biologically ill - informed .
The odd thing is where this has all come from .
I do n't know a single woman ( except , fleetingly , a couple who were seriously deranged ) who hate men or want us to be like them .
Most women seem to quite like men , and resent as much as we do the prevailing culture of contempt and suspicion .
They do n't want articles asking " Are Women Really Bored By Men ( Yes Of Course ! ! ! ) " .
They do n't like the portrayal of men in the media either as violent , raping , child - abusing , monosyllabic incompetents just waiting to whip out their wangers and wreck someone 's lives .
Nor is it simply a matter of intolerance .
I do n't want you to tolerate me , or anything about me .
That 's not in your gift ; to say you are prepared to tolerate me is simply arrogant .
Intolerance ?
No ; though W H Auden , in arguably the most beautiful love - poem of the last hundred years , " Lullaby " ( ostensibly a hymn to gay promiscuous sex ) speaks to all our erotic hearts when he writes of
... lovers as they lie upon
Her tolerant enchanted slopes
In their ordinary swoon
But that 's a different tolerance : a tolerance closer to the original meaning of the word : a bearing of the burden of our common humanity .
Who 's doing this ?
Who 's responsible ?
I do n't know , but I do n't like it and neither do you and it 's not true .
We are n't hateful nor are we vile ; I do n't even think we 're particularly ugly , though I would n't fancy one myself .
Men and women are really quite like each other .
The thing is , we 're also utterly different .
It 's the culture 's task to negotiate that paradox , and right now I do n't think it 's doing a very good job .
Zeeman splitting of spectral lines from a strongly - magnetized sunspot .
Next April , for a grand total of 8 minutes , NASA astronomers are going to glimpse a secret layer of the sun .
Researchers call it " the transition region . "
It is a place in the sun 's atmosphere , about 5000 km above the stellar surface , where magnetic fields overwhelm the pressure of matter and seize control of the sun 's gases .
It 's where solar flares explode , where coronal mass ejections begin their journey to Earth , where the solar wind is mysteriously accelerated to a million mph .
It is , in short , the birthplace of space weather .
Researchers hope it is about to yield its secrets .
" Early next year , we 're going to launch an experimental telescope that can measure vector magnetic fields in the transition region , " explains Jonathan Cirtain of the Marshall Space Flight Center ( MSFC ) .
Previous studies have measured these fields above and below the transition region — but never inside it .
" We hope to be the first . "
The name of the telescope is SUMI , short for Solar Ultraviolet Magnetograph Investigation .
It was developed by astronomers and engineers at the MSFC and is currently scheduled for launch from White Sands , New Mexico , in April 2009 .
SUMI works by means of " Zeeman splitting . "
Dutch physicist Pieter Zeeman discovered the effect in the 19th century .
When a glass tube filled with incandescent gas is dipped into a magnetic field , spectral lines emitted by the gas get split into two slightly different colors — the stronger the field , the bigger the splitting .
The same thing happens on the sun .
Here , for instance , are some spectral lines from gaseous iron being split by the magnetic field of a sunspot ( see image above ) .
By measuring the gap , astronomers estimate the strength of the sunspot 's magnetic field .
Furthermore , by measuring the polarization of the split line , astronomers can figure out the direction of the magnetic field .
Strength + direction = everything you ever wanted to know about a magnetic field !
This trick has been applied to thousands of sunspots on the solar surface , but never to the transition region just a short distance above .
Why not ?
" Just bad luck , really , " says Cirtain .
" Gas in the transition region does n't produce many strong spectral lines that we can see at visible wavelengths . "
It does , however , produce lines at UV wavelengths invisible from Earth 's surface .
" That 's why we have to leave Earth . "
SUMI will blast off inside the nose cone of a Black Brant rocket on a sub-orbital flight that takes it to an altitude of 300 km .
" We 'll be above more than 99.99 % of Earth 's atmosphere , " says Cirtain .
About 68 seconds into the flight , payload doors will open , affording SUMI a crystal - clear view of the UV sun .
" From that moment , we 've only got 8 minutes to work with .
We 'll target an active region and start taking data . "
SUMI 's " vector magnetograph " is tuned to study a pair of spectral lines : one from triply - ionized carbon ( CIV ) at 155 nanometers and a second from singly - ionized magnesium ( MgII ) at 280 nanometers .
" There 's nothing special about those ions , " notes Cirtain .
" They just happen to produce the best and brightest lines at temperatures and densities typical of the transition region . "
Cirtain anticipates how it will feel to have his precious instrument hurtling 300 km above Earth at 5,000 mph : " Eight minutes of terror . "
He 'll start breathing again when the payload doors close and SUMI begins its descent back to Earth .
Cirtain ticks off the stages : " Reentry into the atmosphere .
Open parachutes .
Landing back at White Sands . Recovery . "
The short flight probably wo n't lead to immediate breakthroughs .
" But it will demonstrate the SUMI concept and show us if it 's going to work . "
A successful flight would lead to more flights and eventually to a SUMI - style magnetograph permanently installed on a space telescope .
" That 's the dream , " he says .
Transition region , prepare to yield ...

PERTH ( Reuters ) - Australia could experience more severe droughts and they could become more frequent in the future because of climate change , a government - commissioned report said on Sunday .
Droughts could hit the country twice as often as now , cover an area twice as big and be more severe in key agricultural production areas , the Bureau of Meteorology and Australia ’s top science organization , the CSIRO , said in a joint report .
The study also found that temperatures currently defined as “ exceptional ” were likely to occur , on average , once in every two years in many key agricultural production areas within the next 20 to 30 years , while spells of low rainfall would almost double in frequency from current figures .
Australia , suffering its worst drought in 100 years , has seen its wheat exports tumble in the past two years .
The Pacific nation is normally the second - largest wheat exporter in the world , but the harvest has been decimated to just 13 million tonnes last year because of drought .
The report , commissioned by the left - leaning Labor Party government as part of a review of national drought policy , said about 50 percent of the rainfall decrease in south - western Australia since the 1950s was likely due to emissions of greenhouse gases .
It added current policies defining areas eligible for government drought assistance were out - of - date and more areas needed to be included for drought support .
“ We ’ve already seen farmers walking off the land and rural communities struggling to stay afloat in the face of widespread stress and depression , ” Minister for Agriculture , Fisheries and Forestry Tony Burke said in a statement .
“ Yet this report suggests this rare event could occur much more often due to climate change .
We need to act now to ensure we are better prepared for climate change in the future . ”

Uses Contractors to Probe Iraq Contractors Letting contractors probe other contractors ' alleged Iraq abuses may be illegal .
Oct. 3 , 2008  --
In an apparent violation of federal regulations , the State Department has outsourced to private contractors the responsibility to investigate possible crimes committed by security contractors in Iraq .
Earlier this year , the State Department 's Bureau of Diplomatic Security hired the private firm U.S. Investigations Services ( USIS ) to fill positions in the newly created Force Investigation Unit ( FIU ) that investigates potential misuses of force against civilians by U.S. security contractors .
The contract investigators have been in Iraq since this summer .
The FIU was created in the wake of last year 's deadly shooting in Baghdad 's Nisoor Square , when 17 Iraqi civilians allegedly were killed by security personnel employed by Blackwater Worldwide who were guarding a State Department convoy .
The case sparked widespread outrage and prompted calls for greater oversight of security contractors in Iraq .
According to a contract obtained by ABC News , the company was hired to supplement Diplomatic Security personnel .
However , the eight USIS contractors hired for the team represent the majority of the full - time team , an apparent violation of federal regulations that prohibit such work by contractors .
According to Federal Acquisition Regulation part 7.5 , it is not permissible to hire contractors for jobs " considered to be inherently governmental functions " including " the direct conduct of criminal investigations . "
The State Department did not respond to a list of questions submitted seeking comment , including the status of the contract and whether such a contract might possibly be illegal .
" We received a contract [ and ] we 've staffed it , " USIS spokesman Michael John said .
" Since it 's a contract with the Department of State , we serve at the Department of State 's request .
" If it 's determined that we can't hold a contract , we obviously wo n't be doing work on that contract , " he added .
After the Nisoor Square shooting , much of the forensic evidence was cleaned up before an investigation could take place , making it difficult to build a case against any individuals who might have been accused of wrongdoing .
A State Department review of the incident recommended the creation of a " Go Team " to prevent future investigations from being compromised by preserving evidence and interviewing witnesses quickly after an incident occurs .
The team also would conduct preliminary investigations into weapons discharges and the provision of condolence payments to victims ' families .
The move to staff the FIU " Go Team " with contractors appears to contradict statements made earlier this year by the top State Department official who headed the review .
Asked by reporters if the teams would be staffed by contractors , Ambassador Patrick Kennedy replied , " No , no , the [ FIU ] Go Teams are composed of State Department employees . "
The hiring of investigative contractors has raised concerns in Congress .
In a recent letter to Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice , obtained by ABC News , Sen. Russell Feingold , D - Wis. , called the move to hire contractors for the FIU " highly troubling " because it called into question " the department 's commitment to improving oversight of its contractors . "
He urged cancellation of the contract and manning the FIU solely with government personnel .
" Anything less will further exacerbate tensions within Iraq and the region caused by our perceived failure to hold U.S. contractors accountable for misuse of force against civilians , " Feingold added .
Feingold 's letter also raises concerns about the admissibility in court of evidence not gathered by law enforcement personnel .
" The presence of contractors in the Force Investigation Unit could jeopardize this responsibility and undermine the perceived impartiality of the investigation unit , " the letter says .
Feingold 's office says it has not yet received a response from the State Department .
After the shooting in Nisoor Square , the State Department implemented a number of changes in convoy operating procedures , including the placement of cameras in all convoy vehicles to document potential incidents and a requirement that all department convoys in Iraq must be accompanied by a Diplomatic Security agent .
Feingold also calls into question the need to hire the contractors in the first place , pointing out that the State Department has received funding to hire an additional 100 Diplomatic Security personnel to meet the increased demand for agents in Iraq .
Peter Singer , an expert on private security contractors at the Brookings Institution , agreed with the federal regulation prohibiting contractors from conducting criminal investigations .
" The key question is not whether can a contractor do it , but rather should a contractor do it , " Singer said .
" There are some things that you outsource because it makes sense and it might yield better efficiency .
But there are other functions that are inherently governmental , which you just can't outsource .
" From the perspective of governmental regulations now , overseeing investigations of a criminal law nature is an in - house job , " he added .
" Even more , from the perspective of common sense , it 's a no -brainer .
You do n't have those outside the government as an investigating authority over potential crimes , particularly those in a war zone . "
Despite numerous allegations of misconduct by some of the 20,000 contractors in Iraq , to date , none have been prosecuted .

The U.S. Congress may inadvertently lay the foundations for war against Iran when it reconvenes in Washington this month .
Two essentially identical nonbinding resolutions call upon President Bush to " immediately and dramatically increase the economic , political and diplomatic pressure on Iran to verifiably suspend its nuclear enrichment activities . "
The House resolution has more than 200 cosponsors , including Minnesota Reps .
Michele Bachmann , John Kline and Jim Ramstad .
The Senate resolution has more than 30 cosponsors , including both Minnesota senators , Norm Coleman and Amy Klobuchar .
The methods for increased pressure differ slightly in the two resolutions .
The House resolution calls for " stringent inspection requirements " of all goods entering or leaving Iran .
The Senate resolution does not call for the inspection of all goods but joins the House resolution in calling for an embargo of refined petroleum products to Iran , which lacks the refining capacity to meet its need for gasoline .
Achieving either goal would require a naval blockade -- a de facto act of war on the part of the United States , though paradoxically both resolutions explicitly exclude authorization for military action .
Other provisions call for an economic embargo of banking operations , with the House resolution adding a prohibition of international movement on the part of Iranian officials .
Both resolutions have begun to cause alarm throughout the United States , and have caused several representatives to withdraw their cosponsorships .
Rep. Robert Wexler , D - Fla. , summed up the concerns in an article for the Huffington Post : " It is clear that despite carefully worded language in H. Con.
Res. 362 that ' nothing in this resolution should be construed as an authorization of the use of force against Iran ' that many Americans across the country continue to express real concerns that sections of this resolution will be interpreted by President Bush as ' a green light ' to use force against Iran . "
I really thought we ’d put this conspiracy theory to rest over the summer , but it has arisen like a zombie yet again to suck the credibility out of the conservative blogosphere .
I have had at least 40 e-mails begging me to watch this video featuring Phillip Berg , a PUMA suing Barack Obama and the Democratic Party to prove Obama ’s citizenship — even though Obama has already produced a certification of live birth from Hawaii that would get him a passport any day of the week :
Last week , we got tons of e-mail purporting to claim that Berg had won in court and Obama had three days to produce proof of citizenship .
It turned out that someone had posted an exemplar of the order , produced by the plaintiff in case the judge granted their motion .
In other words , it meant nothing , and neither does this .
Barack Obama was born in Hawaii on August 4 , 1961 , making him a natural - born citizen of the United States .
Hawaii ’s certification of live birth proves this , as Allahpundit and I have both noted this summer .
Fact Check also verified it , although the video does its best to undermine that by noting the connection to the Annenberg Foundation .
By the way , Berg and the video manage to mangle this , too , by claiming Obama sat on the board of the Annenberg Foundation itself and distributed their funding .
He ran the Chicago Annenberg Challenge , one of the foundation ’s beneficiaries .
( The St. Petersburg Times also verified the certification independently . )
Would n’t it be nice if we had a contemporaneous corroboration of Obama ’s Hawaii birth ?
As it happens , we do — provided by another PUMA who wanted to find ways to disqualify Obama .
Lori Starfelt found this in the archives of the Honolulu Advertiser in a print copy from August 1961 :
Unless people want to start claiming that the conspiracy to have Barack Obama infiltrate the political system started at the moment of his birth , that ’s pretty conclusive evidence that Obama was born in the US and is a natural - born citizen .
I already know some of the rebuttals that will fly through the comments , so let me address them here :
A court is hearing this case , so it must be serious —
Any fool with a lawyer and a couple of hundred dollars can file a lawsuit .
That ’s one of the reasons why tort reform is so badly needed .
Frivolous lawsuits cost consumers billions of dollars .
Conservatives used to make that argument , at least until Phillip Berg filed this lawsuit .
Why is n’t Obama answering the lawsuit ? —
Maybe because it ’s ridiculous , and Berg has no standing to file it anyway .
Why not produce the birth certificate ?
— Obama has … twice now , once on his website and once to Fact Check .
Well , then , why did n’t he produce it sooner , smart guy ? —
Sooner than what ?
This came up at the end of the primaries , and the Obama campaign produced it within a couple of weeks .
So far , that has n’t done much to quell the conspiracy theories .
Why not produce the original birth certificate ? —
Most people , I ’d wager , do n’t have their own original birth certificate .
If you applied to get your records , in most states you ’d get what Obama has – a certification of live birth spit out from a computer system .
I doubt Hawaii has the original record any longer , either .
The certification proves citizenship well enough to get a passport .
Let ’s stop chasing absurd conspiracy theories that make it more difficult to win the real arguments in this election .
Stick to Obama ’s absurd theories on national security , his radical political allies , and his disastrous economic policies that will make these past few weeks seem like a breeze .
He ’s the wrong man for the job , but still an American .
Update :
To answer another question ( reasonably asked in the comments ) , Barack Obama ’s Indonesian stepfather could not have revoked Obama ’s birthright as an American citizen , no matter what he told the school Obama attended .
Screw Loose Change has dealt with Phillip Berg before .
It turns out that Berg thinks Bush and Cheney either created 9/11 or let it happen deliberately .
Conspiracy theory nuts do n’t usually stop at one paranoid fantasy , and this demonstrates it .
It turns out he has quite a history of lawsuits and publicity stunts , and this was written at the beginning of 2007 .

The cat ’s finally out of the bag , and Google Chrome is actually in our hands .
So is it impressive enough to be worth converting ?
I ’ll be honest : I was n’t expecting to fall in love with this thing .
I ’m quite pleased with my Firefox setup and have no burning desire to leave it behind .
After two years of development , though , Google ’s built a surprisingly strong overall offering .
The first beta , officially released Tuesday afternoon , incorporates some interesting and appealing features — but it ’s also lacking in some areas that are hard to let go .
The Good
The positives of Chrome are a’plenty .
The program ’s multiprocess design is probably its biggest selling point .
While Firefox 3 improved performance , anyone who has numerous tabs / windows open at once knows how easily one crappy site can still take it down .
Chrome , on the other hand , operates every tab and window in its own unique environment , taking much of the risk away .
Navigated to a slow - running site ?
No problem .
Just close that tab and the rest of your browsing is n’t bothered .
It even runs Java , Flash , and other add - ons in their own environments as well , so some sloppy code wo n’t slow down even the rest of that one page .
The bare - bones design , fitting with Google ’s typical clean interface approach , is rather refreshing .
There ’s really no wasted screen real estate in this thing .
Its file - style tabs are far more intuitive than the standard in - window look , and they ’re way more useful , too .
One of my favorite features is being able to drag tabs in and out of windows at any whim .
I constantly have to cut-and - paste URLs into different windows to accomplish this currently .
Other noteworthy options :
The “ Omnibox ” search / navigation bar , which lets you type in either a URL or a search term without thinking twice ( and even lets you customize your default search choice — it ’s not a Google - only tool ) ; the dynamic home page that shows your most visited sites , search engines , and bookmarks ; and the IE - esque “ Incognito ” feature that lets you activate no-history - browsing .
There ’s also an interesting “ application mode , ” in which you can set a direct desktop shortcut for a Web - based application and have it open as an application rather than as a browser window .
This could come in handy for things like a WordPress log - in or webmail log - in , where you do n’t want to accidentally navigate away from it during the day .
The Bad
The strongest con for me right now is the lack of add - ons .
I rely on several Firefox extensions , and Chrome just does n’t support them yet .
It will eventually , at least in theory — but that does n’t do me any good right now .
The beta nature of the browser is also a serious concern .
Spend some time surfing around and you ’ll see some shifty stuff as far as errors and funky formatting .
Some of this may also be a result of the differing standards .
Google ’s engineers made a point to talk about the compatibility of Chrome ’s WebKit foundation — basically , they say , if a site works with Safari ( which also uses WebKit ) , it ’ll work with Chrome .
That may be , but Safari only accounts for about 6 percent of the browser market .
Most sites are n’t designed with it in mind … so that does n’t do me much good either .
There ’s also the notion of privacy .
One wonders how much sharing Google plans on doing with its various advertising interests .
Do I want them knowing every move I make during the day ?
The Verdict
The speed and performance of Chrome are powerful draws and make me want to move in right now .
Firefox , even in its third release , does n’t often perform to my expectations , and it drives me crazy while I ’m trying to work .
At the same time , though , I ’m not ready to give up my add - on power .
I ’ll keep Chrome on my system and will experiment with it over time , but for now , I ’m holding out on a full switch until a more complete release — complete with the add - ons I need , too — is ready .
As for overall success , it ’s hard to imagine Chrome being able to dethrone IE .
For better or for worse , Microsoft ’s browser accounts for the overwhelming majority of the market — around 70 to 75 percent , depending on whom you ask .
Being that many of those users are on it simply because it ’s the Windows default and they do n’t know or care to change it explains a lot .
Logic would tell you that most people who might try Chrome are more likely to be Firefox users — people who also tend to be the more technologically inclined and curious sort .
So if anything , Chrome may steal some of Mozilla ’s fire — but it seems unlikely it ’ll have a significant impact on IE ’s dominance , unless Google ’s able to eventually secure some type of Windows distribution deal .
Oh , and Mac and Linux users : Google ’s guys insisted your versions are on the way soon .
At today ’s media event , they said they ’ve been working on all three platforms concurrently .
With Windows finished first , they said they wanted to get it out to the public as soon as possible to start getting feedback .
So stay tuned for your turn .
Words fail :
Reading the transcript does n't help :
COURIC : Why is n’t it better , Governor Palin , to spend $ 700 billion helping middle - class families who are struggling with health care , housing , gas and groceries ?
Allow them to spend more , and put more money into the economy , instead of helping these big financial institutions that played a role in creating this mess ?
PALIN : That ’s why I say I , like every American I ’m speaking with , we 're ill about this position that we have been put in .
Where it is the taxpayers looking to bail out .
But ultimately , what the bailout does is help those who are concerned about the health care reform that is needed to help shore up our economy .
Um , helping , oh , it ’s got to be about job creation , too .
Shoring up our economy , and putting it back on the right track .
So health care reform and reducing taxes and reining in spending has got to accompany tax reductions , and tax relief for Americans , and trade we have got to see trade as opportunity , not as , uh , competitive , um , scary thing , but one in five jobs created in the trade sector today .
We ’ve got to look at that as more opportunity .
All of those things under the umbrella of job creation .
EA has some exciting new IP in the works for both consoles and the PC .
At E3 this year , both Dead Space and Mirror 's Edge had the show talking .
At EA 's press conference , we were able to watch a new trailer for Dead Space , called " Lullaby . "
The trailer was pretty dark , and we were warned to close our eyes if we were under the age of 17 .
We then got an e-mail saying that the game trailer was n't going to be shown in the US .
" This is called the Lullaby Trailer , and is banned here in the US ( well not banned , but was n't approved ) by the ESRB because well , it 's pretty gory .
EU was allowed to have it and Gametrailers posted it up , " EA told us .
Go give it a watch , it 's a pretty brutal trailer .
Was it really so bad the ESRB had to put a stop to it ?
The ratings group did n't have any problems with the James Wan- directed " Loved Ones " trailer , which is also up on Gametrailers , and that was n't exactly bloodless .
James
Wan , for those who are n't horror fans , is the writer and director behind the torture - porn Saw films .
Dead Space looks great , and I 'll actually be flying out to San Francisco in early August in order to take a closer look .
For now , enjoy the trailers , and marvel at the idea of bloody teasers being unapproved .
If Ben E. was given three words to describe his job , he ’d use bureaucracy , bureaucracy , and after filling out Form 811B - AW ( Request to Use More Than Three Words Form ) , serious fricken bureaucracy .
But alas , when one works for The State , things like serious fricken bureaucracy , vast documentation , and threats of being hired are simply par for the course .
When he first started as an Application Reports Developer for The State , Ben was n’t at all cynical .
While he was certainly aware of the bureaucracy at large government offices , the office he would be working at had all of twenty people .
And since they ’re quite a distance from The State ’s capitol , he naïvely concluded , people would naturally work as a team instead of teaming - up to avoid work .
One of Ben ’s first tasks was to configure his workstation to be able to print to the wide - format printer .
Though Ben was perfectly capable of following the printer installation wizard , he needed a password to connect to the printer .
“ Just ask Michael , ” Ben ’s boss advised , “ he sets all that stuff up . ”
Michael worked in a cubicle on the other side of the room .
It was a good twenty to twenty - five feet from Ben ’s desk .
“ Sorry , ” Michael said in response to Ben ’s request for some printer help , “ you ’ll have to run that through Jessica first . ”
Jessica was the lead network technician , and her cubicle was directly next to Michael’s .
“ You ’re going to have to call support , ” she told Ben , “ just dial out 774-6216 . ”
A Printer Problem
Ben did n’t mind the runaround .
After all , he assumed , a printer setup is a pretty rare occurrence in a small office , and it probably has to go through central networking or something .
He walked back to his desk and dialed the number for support .
“ The number you dialed is incorrect , ” the recording read , “ please hang up and try again . ”
Figuring he needed an outside line , Ben tried 9-774-6216 , only to be greeted by the same message .
Ben walked back to Jessica ’s desk to see what he was doing wrong .
“ Uhhh , ” she said in a condescending tone , “ just pick up your phone and press 7 , 7 , 4 , 6 , 2 , 1 , 6 .
That ’s the support line . ”
Ben walked back to his desk and reasoned that he must have pressed one of the wrong buttons on the phone keypad .
He tried it again , slowly .
7 . 7 . 4 . 6 . 2 . 1 . 6 .
“ The number you dialed is incorrect .
Please hang up and try again . ”
Ben walked back to Jessica ’s desk and asked if he needed to dial 9 or something first .
“ Well yeah , ” she scoffed , “ of course you have to dial 8 first ! ”
He walked back to his desk , dialed 8-774-6216 , and was once again greeted by the message .
Not wanting to appear desperate , Ben waited a little while before returning to Jessica .
“ Okay , watch me , ” she exasperated , clearly annoyed at his persistence .
Jessica picked up her phone and pressed 8 , 1 , 7 , 7 , 4 , 6 , 2 , 1 , 6 . “ There , see ? ”
Fortunately , 81-774-6216 did the trick .
After returning to his desk and dialing the number , Ben finally got a hold of support and explained his printer problem .
“ We can certainly help you with that , ” the support rep responded , “ an onsite network technician will contact you within twenty - four hours .
Please note your ticket number : 6840012203 . ”
Later that day , Ben ran into Jessica in the break room .
Since she was one of the two onsite network technicians , he asked her when they ’d be able to get to that ticket .
“ Like I told you on the phone , ” Jessica responded in a much nicer tone than before , “ someone will contact you . ”
It took a few moments for Ben to process the first part of her response .
When did I talk to her on the phone ?
Is she thinking of someone el — and then it dawned on him .
There was a reason that the support rep ’s voice sounded so familiar : she was Jessica , and 774-6216 was Jessica ’s number .
A Printer Solution
The following morning , Ben ’s phone rang .
It was Michael , checking to see if Ben had a few minutes to setup the printer .
Ben stood up in his low - walled cubicle to get a direct line - of - sight to Michael and invited him on over .
Expected him to hang - up , stand - up , and walk twenty feet over , Michael instead responded , “ Actually , I ’ll just remote in and do it real quick . ”
Ten minutes later , Ben watched as Michael remote - controlled his computer from across the room .
Halfway through the printer installation , an error dialog popped - up :
There was an error copying file ml882 print.hlp : file not found .
[ Ignore ] [ Retry ]
Michael clicked Retry , only to have the same exact message pop-up again .
He clicked Retry again , and got the same message .
After three more attempts , he clicked Start , Shutdown , and then Restart .
When the computer came back up , Michael resumed control and found himself stuck at the same point in the installation .
Clicking Retry – even clicking it five times – resulted in the same File Not Found error .
Rebooting two more times did n’t help much , either .
As Ben shifted his glaze from his computer screen to Michael controlling his screen , he watched the frustrated Michael pick up his phone and , presumably , explain the problem to the person on the other line .
Moments later , Jessica walked over from her cubicle and commandeered Michael ’s workstation .
Jessica , now controlling Ben ’s workstation through Michael ’s , clicked Retry .
She , too , was greeted with a file not found message .
After clicking Retry twice more , she hesitantly moved the mouse over the Ignore button and then clicked it .
Ten seconds later , the printer installation completed successfully .
NEW YORK ( CNN ) -- Pakistan 's new president called GOP vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin " gorgeous " when the two met in New York on Wednesday .
Vice presidential candidate Sarah Palin meets Pakistani President Asif Ali Zardari in New York on Wednesday .
Palin has been in New York meeting international leaders in town this week for United Nations meetings .
On entering a room filled with several Pakistani officials Wednesday , Palin was immediately greeted by Sherry Rehman , the country 's information minister .
" And how does one keep looking that good when one is that busy ? "
Rehman asked Palin , drawing friendly laughter from the room .
" Oh , thank you , " Palin said .
Pakistan 's new president , Asif Ali Zardari , entered the room seconds later .
Palin rose to shake his hand , saying she was " honored " to meet him .
Zardari then called her " gorgeous " and said : " Now I know why the whole of America is crazy about you . "
" You are so nice , " Palin said , smiling .
" Thank you . "
A handler from Zardari 's entourage then told the two politicians to keep shaking hands for the cameras .
" If he 's insisting , I might hug , " Zardari said .
Palin smiled politely in response .
The Alaska governor did not answer questions from reporters at her first two appearances on Wednesday , when she joined running mate Sen .
John McCain in meetings with Georgian President Mikhail Saakashvili and Ukrainian president Viktor Yushchenko and then traveled downtown to meet with Iraqi President Jalal Talabani .
But she did offer brief remarks to a reporter at the Zardari meeting who asked about her day .
" It 's going great , " Palin said .
" These meetings are very informative and helpful , and a lot of good people sharing appreciation for America . "

Monday , Iran 's state - controlled media announced the test firing of a weapon that it claims is capable of sinking ships nearly 200 miles away .
It was followed by a warning from the commander of the Islamic Revolutionary Guards Corps ( IRGC ) that the forces could respond to any attack by closing the Strait of Hormuz , an oil transit point .
If implemented , oil prices would likely skyrocket , as a huge amount of the world 's oil passes through the Strait of Hormuz , a narrow passage along Iran 's southern coast .
IRGC chief Brigadier General Mohammad
Ali claimed that the new weapon runs on an indigenously developed that no other nation has experimented with before .
He did not disclose the date and venue of the testing .
" None of the enemy 's vessels or warships operating in a radius of more than 300 kilometers from Iran 's borders will be safe from this weapon , and without a doubt , they will be sunk deep into the region 's waters , " Ja'fari was quoted as saying .
Iranian leaders ' frequent threats of attacks and claims of developing long - range weapons are viewed as the oil - producing nation 's tactic to create geo-political tension , which in turn will help in speeding up the upward trend of oil prices .
A similar threat by Ja'fari on June 28 ignited a steep rise in the price of crude to a record high .

A hush filled the packed chambers of the Nebraska Supreme Court as attorney Robert Bartle played a chilling 50 - second tape recording of the emergency call that lured Omaha police officer Larry Minard to his 1970 ambush - bombing death .
A man 's deep gritty voice could be heard making a report about a woman screaming at a vacant house .
The Omaha World - Herald described the killer 's voice as " deep and drawling . "
Attorney Bartle told the justices , " That is n't the voice of a 15 - year old .
That is not the voice of Duane Peak . "
Duane Peak was a teenager who confessed to planting the bomb and making the deadly phone call .
Peak also implicated Black Panther leaders Ed Poindexter and Mondo we Langa ( formerly David Rice ) in exchange for his own lenient treatment and became the state 's murderous star witness against the two Panthers .
However , if Peak did not make the call as he claimed , the case against Poindexter and Langa unravels leaving an unidentified killer on the loose .
The scratchy tape , never heard by the jury that convicted the Panther leaders , has a long , troubling history and was kept under wraps by order of J. Edgar Hoover , then - director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation .
Hoover had declared a secret war against the Black Panther Party and other domestic political groups code - named Operation COINTELPRO .
The " no holds barred " tactics of COINTELPRO directed at the Panthers had a lethal ferocity with false arrests and convictions as one of the techniques .
Hoover 's agents had already targeted Poindexter and Langa when the August bombing claimed Minard 's life .
The FBI arrived at the crime scene soon after the blast and helped direct the investigation .
The Omaha Special - Agent - in - Charge worked directly with Asst. Chief of Police Glen W. Gates who led the murder investigation .
While uniformed officers began a massive sweep of Omaha 's Near - Northside neighborhood arresting dozens of people and technicians sifted through blast debris looking for clues , Gates met with the FBI and agreed to send the tape recording of the killer 's voice to the FBI crime laboratory in Washington , D.C. to identify the caller .
The Omaha World - Herald headline told the public " Voiceprint in Bombing to FBI Lab " .
A police spokesman told the paper the tape would be a " good investigative tool " .
But the tape was sent to the FBI lab with unusual instructions to not issue a formal report and instead orally inform the Omaha FBI office of the results of analysis .
The COINTELPRO hidden agenda was not to catch the actual killers of Minard but instead make a case against Poindexter and Langa .
When Ivan Willard Conrad , director of the crime lab , got the memo requesting a secret report on the tape he spoke with Hoover by phone two days after the bombing .
Before Minard 's body was buried , Hoover gave the command to withhold an official report thus limiting the search for the policeman 's killer .
Conrad scrawled on his copy of the COINTELPRO memo , " Dir advised telephonically & said OK to do " followed by his initials and date .
Conrad followed Hoover 's orders and issued no formal findings on the identity of the unknown caller .
However , the Omaha Special - Agent - in - Charge sent another COINTELPRO memo to Hoover two months later in October .
" Assistant COP GLENN GATES , Omaha PD , advised that he feels any use of this call might be prejudicial to the police murder trial against two accomplices of PEAK and , therefore , has advised that he wishes no use of this tape until after the murder trials of PEAK and the two accomplices have been completed . "
The hearing was in the austere chambers of the state high court located in the Nebraska Capitol and was filled with supporters of Poindexter and Langa , many wearing T - shirts indentifying the ' Omaha Two ' as political prisoners .
Questions from the bench focused on the custody of the tape and who was to blame for withholding the recording from the jury .
Assistant Attorney General James
Smith argued everyone knew there was a tape and failure of the defense attorneys to introduce the tape at trial was a tactical decision by lawyers for the two Panthers .
Bartle 's argument is that the prosecution should have provided the tape to defense attorneys as a part of discovery .
Regardless of who was at fault for the jury not getting to hear the killer 's voice Bartle said , " The whole point to Poindexter is that he was still deprived of the use of the tape . "
Smith countered that Frank Morrison , a former - Nebraska governor and Poindexter 's court - appointed lawyer , made a tactical decision and Poindexter had to live with it .
However , not long before his death Morrison gave a deposition in 2003 about his role in the case and he admitted making mistakes that led to an unfair trial .
Morrison 's strongest statement about the matter came earlier in 1997 in the form of a public letter .
" As a citizen and former prosecutor , and Governor of this state , I abhor , detest and condemn the cowardly , cruel , and unjustified murder of officer Minard .
My heart aches for his family .
The guilty parties should pay the penalty .
The self - confessed murderer was turned loose after a slap on the wrist . "
" I now believe and always have believed that the true role of law enforcement is truth .
Real justice can only be built on truth .
I hope the Congress and other policy makers will reestablish this policy .
I feel both I and the system failed Ed Poindexter . "

I started out like I mentioned wanting a SOLID handheld .
So I decided to try a technique not used much .
For plastic if you use normal epoxy and Bondo spot putty , it can and usually will crack .
So I used ABS Cement to fuse the parts like the screen , controller , etc to the case .
Then I used Plastic Bumper Epoxy Hard filler to fill major gaps and fuse it together even more .
: Then I use Plastic Bumper Flexible Filler as the " spot putty " to finish it off smoothe and crack free for life .
Please note in the following pics I decided to abandon the white piece and add the controller later .
The process is pretty easy .
You cut the parts for as close a fit as possible .
Then put a spot or three of hot glue to hold the part in place .
Tape the backside of the case for large gap areas .
The I use a cue tip , dip it in the Abs cement and drip it in between the two parts .
It adheres pretty quick .
I let it dry in front of a fan for an hour then do it again to fill in missing gaps .
Let it dry about 2 - 3 hours , flip it over and remove the tape and then using the cue tips drip in the Abs Cement REALLY thick on the backside .
Now let it dry for a couple of days .
After a couple of days sand down the Abs plastic on the front side with 36 - 40 grit sandpaper until it is smooth and level , do n't worry about low spots .
Now it 's time to move on to the hard filler .
Mix it and apply it liberally in the areas you need to fill and mold .
It dries in 15 minutes and you can sand it down .
Use 36 - 40 grit paper and sand it down real good and as smooth as you can get it .

SHANGHAI  One of China ’s biggest dairy producers received consumer complaints about its baby milk formula as early as December 2007  much earlier than previously thought and 10 months before the producer ordered a nationwide recall because of concerns that the formula had been adulterated with a toxic industrial chemical , state media said Tuesday .
The disclosure , in a government report publicized by the official Xinhua News Agency , is the latest indication that the producer , Sanlu Group , had repeatedly tried to hide information about its contaminated dairy supplies from the public .
Powdered milk formula in China tainted by melamine , a chemical compound , has already sickened more than 53,000 infants and killed three children nationwide , according to the Health Ministry , leading to recalls of Chinese - made dairy products in China and other parts of Asia , devastating this nation ’s huge dairy industry and casting a renewed pall over the quality of Chinese food production .
Officials at the Sanlu Group , which is based in northern China ’s Hebei Province , could not be reached for comment on Tuesday .
The government report did not include details about the nature or number of consumer complaints but put the timing of when they began at least six months earlier than first reported .
These old street fighters remained loyal to Hitler , taking orders from no one else .
Dr Hermann found invitations and seating plans for the November 9 Town Hall rally that showed 39 of these old comrades sat at adjacent tables to Hitler .
They included Hitler 's chief adjutant Julius Schaub and chauffeur Emil Maurice .
These were the same 39 men who later hit the streets and destroyed the Ohel Jacob synagogue that night , fanning the flames of an incendiary situation – on direct orders , Dr Hermann concludes , of Hitler himself .
Looks like even the most wealthy and powerful of us are affected by the economic crisis .
Eli was in Chicago this week for vacation and made a point to visit as many “ Dark Knight ” filming locations as possible .
He TXT ’d me “ do a comic about Batman playing music in the subway for change . ”
This is close enough .
I ’d like to see Hobo Bruce Wayne fighting over a half a pizza crust with Boxcar Pete .
Bruce is probably a better fighter , but Pete is n’t afraid to kill .
I wonder what other “ services ” Bruce Wayne could offer his clients .
“ A Hot Harvey Dent , ” “ A Reverse Riddler , ” “ A Penguin Flipper ( It ’s like The Shocker ) . ”
I ’m sure the list goes on and on .
Got any other items for the “ menu ? ”
When Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain visit Florida on Friday they 'll find a split electorate in a state that 's been eager to play a decisive role since primaries ended in June .
Obama has been playing catch - up with a vengeance after refusing to campaign here during the primaries because of a Democratic Party dispute over its January contest date .
He has spent $ 5 million on TV ads in Florida , more than in any other state , and dispatched 200 staffers there .
McCain is not airing any TV ads in Florida and has 40 staffers .
After trailing McCain in May polls by as much as 10 points , Obama has squeaked by his Republican rival .
A Quinnipiac University poll released Thursday shows Obama up 46 % to 44 % , within the margin of error .
Friday , Obama holds a town hall on economic issues in St. Petersburg and McCain holds a fundraising concert in Panama City .
Both will speak at the National Urban League annual convention in Orlando over the weekend .
For McCain , Florida is the state that handed him the nomination when he knocked out Rudy Giuliani and Mitt Romney in the Jan. 29 Republican primary .
He 's backed by the state 's popular Gov. Charlie Crist , and he has emphasized he lived in Jacksonville after his 1973 release from a North Vietnamese POW camp .
Both candidates are advertising on radio to Hispanic voters , where polls show Obama with a big lead .
Jewish voters , traditionally Democratic , also favor Obama but not currently by as large a margin as they did John Kerry in 2004 .
As a result , Jewish voters are " definitely " a target audience for McCain , says Florida GOP chairman Jim Greer .
To that end , McCain 's campaign has frequently deployed Sen.
Joseph Lieberman of Connecticut , who will campaign in the state next week .
" He 's not only a leader , he 's a Jewish leader and they follow what he has to say , " Greer says .
Still , McCain is not on TV to counter Obama 's barrage — and the Democrat is running as many ads in North Florida and the heavily Republican panhandle as in the southern part of the state that usually favors Democrats , points out Ken Goldstein of the University of Wisconsin Advertising Project , which tracks political ad spending .
Obama 's big spending is " a tell that they think ( the state ) really is in play , " Goldstein says .
Thursday 's poll shows a narrower margin for Obama than Quinnipiac 's poll a month ago , which had Obama up 47 % - 43 % .
McCain 's embrace of offshore oil drilling could be winning favor with Florida voters who recently switched themselves , says Peter Brown , assistant director of the Quinnipiac Polling Institute .
Offshore drilling has long been unpopular in the state , and as a result , with politicians campaigning there .
But in June , McCain said he agreed with giving states the power to allow the drilling , and has since been hammering Obama on his opposition .
" When McCain switched on drilling , a lot of people said , ' There goes Florida , ' " Brown says .
But Quinnipiac 's poll shows 60 % of Florida voters now favor offshore drilling , and 10 % of them have changed their mind from opposing it .
McCain has also gained support among independents : he leads 47 % - 41 % compared with 47%- 37 % for Obama a month ago .
" To know why , just fill up your gas tank , " Brown says .
Independent voters are fickle , and " voters are willing to embrace almost anything they think will lower gas prices , " says Steve Schale , Obama 's Florida campaign director , who says drilling would not bring prices down .

There are times when something magnificent happens to you , and you can feel it altering not just your day but your whole life .
As in :
This is the start of the better , happier days .
And you realize how lucky you are to have found this path , and you wo n't ever forget it .
But with the addition of time you 've lost the magic .
You do n't know how , or even when .
You can't make anything mean what it did , and taking responsibility does n't solve the problem .
You feel sick , and stupid , and sad , and you sometimes wish you 'd never discovered the special secret .
I have n't flown in ...
God , almost a month .
There was only the one time .
I ended up touching down on a fire escape just to see if I could , and I got so overcome by gravity that I had to sit down shaking .
Total Air Time : maybe 8 , 10 minutes ?
I could n't say , shit 's different up there .
Then I clambered to the street and searched for the subway .
At home , face to the pillow , I had bizarre adrenaline fantasies ( back in high school , but with a cock ring -- I can't eat that soup , it 's the wrong color -- I know every word ever invented , and I 'm working on more ) and levitation seemed like just one more the next day .
I did n't tell anyone .
I bought all the newspapers , which I never do .
Jack shit .
The Post ( which no one with a brain believes anyway ) mentioned a resurgence of those dangerous vandals who ride the roofs of train cars .
One suspect allegedly " leaped into the air just like Spider - Man . "
Uh - huh , thank you , that 's flattering but idiotic .
And that 's it .
Nothing to show for it .
So I went into work .
Because I need the fuckin money .
-------
So here I am at Bryant Park .
Midtown Manhattan .
Exactly one city block worth of green grass , with square skycrapers on all four sides .
It 's dusk , and I face west , toward the pink I can glimpse in the cracks between buildings .
I hop the rope and stride to the exact center of the lawn .
I do n't know why this is blocked off .
But it 's where I need to be .
I kneel , dirt on the cargo pants , and lay my hands on the earth .
Close my eyes .
Please , brain .
Please remember how to do this .
I am afraid but I know I can .
Cell phone rings and yuppie chatter .
Sirens .
It 's no use .
I can't even remember what to be concentrating on .
I stand up and turn around , gazing through the windows of the storehouse of knowledge .
There 's got to be something in there that can help me .
Or maybe not .
Maybe I 'm in uncharted territory here .
The security guard uses the word " Sir ! " the same way I usually do , as a synonym for idiot .
There 's just one , he 's old and fat , and he has n't crossed the rope yet .
I still have about a minute .
And now my mind is racing .
There 's this whole planet .
This whole huge big round rock .
And I 've only seen the very top of one little corner .
As a child I wanted to be an astronaut , of course .
I used to assume the earth was simply too large to fit in my imagination , because I 'd never seen the whole thing from the outside .
But now I realize I 've never seen the limits of my imagination either .
All of those thousands of miles of text in front of me could already be in my head , for all I know , on an invisible spool .
( " Sir !
Get off the lawn ! " )
It 's impossible not to feel the energy rising around me .
Funneled .
There 's this whole planet ( so so big , but I 've got it ) , and there 's me seeing it from the outside at last .
But I must also be on it .
Well , how do I know ?
I mean , if one speck out of six billion were to suddenly float away , what difference would it make ?
You could n't even tell .
The funny part was , the guy could have brought me down by the ankle if he'd just kept running , but when he saw my feet flip out from under me as I wafted up on my back , he stopped dead .
Yeah , that 's goin ' in your report , fucker .
There 's no mistaking this one .
Now I 'm maybe fifty feet up .
Staying that low .
Slowly drifting toward the sunset before the stars come out , over traffic now .
Beep beep .
Maybe I should head a little further up .
I do n't want to cause an accident .
This is tough for me , because my fear of heights is not being assuaged in the slightest .
But maybe I do n't have to be in denial about the hard dangerous ground .
Looking down is okay as long as I 'm seeing everything that 's there .
-------
Below me , the myriad stories make a maze of cause and effect .
That little girl with the popsicle .
That athletic dude with the sniffing dogs .
All those chugging cars that are just way longer than they need to be ; no wonder there 's so much traffic here .
Uh-oh .
The percentage of folks looking up at me is perhaps a smidge too high .
And they are shouting things .
That wo n't help me .
Quick :
The lava eats the lichen .
The glacier chills the beverage .
Last night 's drizzle is my sweat dripping off my nose onto that red and yellow hot dog cart umbrella and hey where 's the why the FUCK AM I FALLING god no help what 's
( close eyes )
The sun is its true size and I 'm just an electron .
The sun .
The sun .
Its gravity will hold me up .
I feel the forces of heat and wind support me and I rise again .
I need to go up , up now .
And out over the river .
I 'm keeping my eyes closed .
I do n't want to know how close the pavement was .
It 's almost dark anyway .
-------
So here I am , floating , not on the water but above it .
How high , it 's hard to say .
There 's really no reference points out here between Hoboken and Manhattan .
The indigo blanket has finally fully dropped .
But anyway , I 'd guesstimate three hundred feet , three fifty
Now I will test this ability , like I would a car , or a stereo system .
Unfortunately , it 's more like a parachute in practice : I wo n't get a second chance if it fails .
I just want to come down .
See , there 's a certain altitude beyond which it does n't matter what you land on .
Pillows or Jell - O , your own bones are still rock hard , and the sudden stop grinds your organs into paste .
So the water is n't really helping me out .
I just came out here to be alone with my world .
It 's maps I 'm focusing on .
The exact curves and bumps on the coastlines of Florida , Spain , Australia .
It 's working , but I 'm going to have to study when I get home .
Okay , lowering self , now .
Slowly .
Good .
I spread my arms , like flying people are apparently supposed to do , and spiral like a maple seed .
The tickling air makes me chuckle for a second .
Do n't forget Chile and Belize .
I 'm zooming in on real sandy beaches , not atlas lines .
I can't tell which reality I 'm smelling .
No wait , I can .
Drop like a missile .
I do it .
I 'm aiming for only half the speed of gravity .
Your stomach knows that dreaded lurch and I have n't reached it yet .
But this is n't exactly relaxing .
Shit , was that a damn bug ?
Do n't be distracted .
Madagascar .
Norway .
Pangaea .
Slow , slow , slowwwwwwwwww .
Do n't hope .
Happenize it .
That was so fast .
I did n't even have time to think about death .
So now I 'm standing , hovering , right above the river .
If you saw me from a passing boat you 'd think I was standing on the waves .
I find that staying still this close to the earth requires tremendous exertion .
I 'm gritting my teeth , shaking a bit .
But I do n't need maps anymore , the blinking skyline is doing it for me .
I put my right foot forward .
Aw , come on .
Of course it does n't actually catch on anything .
Stupid .
I would just be moving two unrelated muscles simultaneously .
That will take practice and I 'm not willing to waste time on it now when it 's just for show .
So technically I can't walk out here .
But .
You still have to admit it 's cooler than converting dihydrogen monoxide into ethanol .

LOCAL authorities across the UK were yesterday stunned to discover that Iceland is nothing more than a volcano surrounded by two million haddock .
As the volcano 's banks refused to pay out , councils said they were convinced Iceland was a small , landlocked country next to Belgium with a long history of expert financial management .
But after 15 minutes on the internet they confirmed it was nothing more than a slab of stinking lava populated by a handful of wilfully eccentric musicians and half a dozen heavily bearded trawler captains .
Julian Cook , director of finance at the Local Government Association , said : " I meant Luxembourg – shit !
" I suppose the haddock - shaped piece of lava with every new account was probably a clue . "
Mr Cook is now demanding £ 1bn of taxpayers ' money in compensation for losing £ 1bn of taxpayers ' money .
He added : " When the taxpayer is exposed in this way it is only right that central government should step in with its own funds , wherever they come from . "
But the Treasury has so far refused , criticising the councils for investing huge amounts of public money in badly run banks .

In early February 2007 , Stephanie Lenz 's 13 - month - old son started dancing .
Pushing a walker across her kitchen floor , Holden Lenz started moving to the distinctive beat of a song by Prince , " Let 's Go Crazy . "
He had heard the song before .
The beat had obviously stuck .
So when Holden heard the song again , he did what any sensible 13 - month - old would do -- he accepted Prince 's invitation and went " crazy " to the beat .
Holden 's mom grabbed her camcorder and , for 29 seconds , captured the priceless image of Holden dancing , with the ...
The economy has hit everyone hard .
Well , everyone who has n't lost track of how many houses they own , anyhow .
It 's particularly hard on freelancers .
I 'm on a bunch of writers ' lists ; one woman lamented that , as a full - time writer , she 's paying out $ 17,000 per year on health insurance .
Not health care , mind you , just insurance .
She 's done the math and the alternative would be much worse .
For every author raking in the mad cash like Stephen King or Stephenie Meyer , there are 1,000 more novelists praying that the 4 - months - late royalty check or story payment will arrive and the electricity wo n't get turned off .
So , the vast majority of us have day jobs .
I'm in the particularly weird situation that my day job , although it has excellent health insurance , does n't pay for a frugal adult lifestyle .
One of my coworkers lamented he has n't been able to find a second job , and the bills keep piling up .
He 's smart , educated , very pleasant , conscientious , dedicated , married , his wife works , and his kids have left the nest .
He always brown - bags his lunch , and he has a 10 - year - old car .
He 's been at the university for probably twenty years now , and has hit the magical age where he 's experiencing age discrimination in any job he applies for .
A guy like him should n't be in this position .
I directed him to the tutoring service ( thanks , Lometa ! ) that I 've had as my third job for the past year .
It does n't pay that well , but it does pay , and at least I have the sense that I 'm helping someone .
So between my full - time job during the week and my 10 - hours - if - I - can - get - 'em tutoring job on the weekend , I write .
I need to write at least three pages a day to comfortably meet my next novel deadline , and I also pick up nonfiction freelance ( thanks , smartalix ! ) when I can .
Gary writes his ass off and also stays up late reading manuscripts and writing critiques .
So with 6 different jobs between the two of us , our heads are above water , but just .
Things are going well , until they suddenly are n't .
So I work as much as I can .
Which is why y'all probably wo n't be seeing much but sporadic daylogs from me .
Sorry .
For those that are interested , Spellbent will be out in probably the fall of 2009 .
I 'll let y'all know , even though a few of you have made it clear that you see such announcements as some kind of unseemly bragging .
Sorry , but it 's my life .
WASHINGTON , Aug. 23 ( UPI ) -- A U.S. military study blames guard lapses and lenient policies for prisoner suicides at Guantanamo Bay , Cuba .
Documents from a Naval Criminal Investigative Service probe suggest that three simultaneous suicides June 10 , 2006 , were the result of " lapses in guard protocol and of lenient policies toward compliant detainees , " The Washington Post reported Saturday after obtaining results from a Freedom of Information Act request .

Ali Abdullah Ahmed Naser al - Sullami , 26 , of South Yemen , along with Saudi Arabians Yasser Talal al - Zahrani , 22 , and Mana Shaman Allabard al - Tabi , 32 , planned their hangings carefully say the documents .
Investigators found that guards became lax on some rules , rewarding more compliant detainees with extra T - shirts , blankets and towels .
Detainees were then allowed to hang the items to dry .
Eventually they were sometimes used to obscure their cells while sleeping .
Sullami's attorney , David Engelhardt , blamed conditions at Guantanamo and U.S. policies for the suicides .
" It 's simply astounding that it took the government over two years to conclude a so - called investigation of three men who died in a small cage under the government 's exclusive control , " he said .
" The investigation itself is what needs to be investigated , along with the people who 've perpetrated the disgraceful , extra-constitutional detentions . "
It could n't happen to a nicer bunch of people .
The collapse of Starbucks , I mean .
This week the Seattle - based coffee kahuna announced it is closing 600 of its 6,800 US stores and laying off more than 12,000 employees , or " partners " in the company 's New Age -y jargon .
The bad news is the culmination of a long , downward spiral .
During the past year , the stock has dropped nearly 50 percent , as the allure of high beverage prices and Italianate jargon - what does " venti " mean , anyway ?
- fades away , along with Americans ' discretionary income .
Starbucks had a unique selling proposition : Let 's charge $ 3 and up for an above - average coffee drink .
It was n't a blindingly original idea ; Alfred Peet , mining the European café tradition in Berkeley , inspired the original Starbucks founders in Seattle and George Howell 's Coffee Connection in Boston .
But huckster - visionary - entrepreneur Howard Schultz took the Starbucks concept and wallpapered the land with the buxom green mermaid logo and espresso- slinging baristas .
Schultz was the Ray Kroc of coffee ( Kroc was the fellow who bought the Golden Arches from the original McDonald brothers ) but acted more like Deepak Chopra .
While behaving like a Gilded Age robber baron - just for a lark , Google the words " Starbucks " and " labor unions " or " fair trade " - Schultz positioned Starbucks as a countercultural concern .
The company hyped its sofa - stuffed lounges as a new , American " third place , " an alternative to work and home .
I 'm always amazed at the high - class hobos who clutter up Starbucks , the MacBook " novelists , " and the Bluetooth - enabled " consultants , " nursing their lattes and milking the Internet .
The Dunkin ' Donuts outlets in my neighborhood offer a glaring contrast .
I hit Dunkin ' a few mornings each week after exercising .
It 's the only time of day when I interact with men and women who actually work for a living .
What went wrong at Starbucks ?
To invoke the venerable business cliche , they did n't stick to their knitting .
Their core business was overcharging consumers for coffee , and a very lucrative business it was .
Then they started selling dreamy CDs , and the company even helped produce a movie , " Akilah and the Bee , " that bombed at the box office .
Schultz bought a basketball team and started hanging out with Mick Jagger and Paul McCartney , the usual recipe for business disaster .
Starbucks also made it their business to save the world .
The world needs saving , I can't argue with that .
But I wonder if Starbucks is best qualified to perform the rescue .
To be fair , the company tries harder than many others to provide decent health benefits for its employees , and I suppose they are welcome to sell " Ethos " water and educate rural teachers in China .
But if they do n't figure out a way to move more java , they 'll lose the opportunity to feel wonderful about themselves .
You can't do good if you are n't doing well .
What now ?
Starbucks is throwing a couple of Hail Mary passes .
They 've just introduced a new , brewed coffee called Pike Place , which tastes OK , and , like their other regular brews , costs the same as Dunkin 's coffee .
( " Swill , " as Schultz rather ungraciously calls it in the current issue of Portfolio magazine . )
Taking a page from Jamba Juice , Starbucks plans to start offering " healthy , " protein - boosted smoothies and a new frozen drink , which Schultz is calling " a game changer in the coffee space . "
It 's hard to change a game that 's already over , but there 's no harm in trying .
Free plug
I spotted this line in Portfolio 's Starbucks article : " By now , many of the coffee snobs have gone elsewhere . "
So true !

We have many great anti-tumor drugs that can do a fantastic job destroying the molecular insides of tumor cells .
There is , however , a major catch : tumors have a nasty habit of become drug resistant .
Such is the case with the breast cancer chemotherapeutic agent docetaxel .
This drug can be effective at stopping breast cancer , but unfortunately many tumors are docetaxel - resistant .
50 % of breast cancer patients receiving their initial course of chemotherapy are resistant to docetaxel , and it gets worse for patients who have already had chemotherapy - 70 - 80 % of patients who have already received chemotherapy do n't respond to this drug .
Administering docetaxel to resistant patients obviously wastes time that could be spent on other treatments .
It also causes needless suffering of side effects .
But is there some way to predict in advance who is going to be resistant ?
Or better yet , is there something we can do to eliminate docetaxel resistance altogether ?
A Japanese group from the Japanese National Cancer Research Institute set out to tackle this problem , and their encouraging results have been reported in Nature Medicine .
These researchers discovered a gene that makes breast cancer cells resistant to docetaxel , and they used that knowledge to knock out the source of docetaxel resistance .
Although this study was largely confined to petri dishes and mice , cancer researchers can now use this result to identify patients who wo n't respond to docetaxel , and they are ready to test this new therapy target in real human cancers .
Finding the Culprit Gene
What makes cancer cells drug resistant ?
We have an amazing arsenal of chemicals that attack all sorts of molecular processes inside cancer cells , and yet many tumors manage to evade the onslaught .
They do this using a fantastic toxic waste disposal system made of up membrane pumps known as P - glycoproteins .
P - glycoproteins sit embedded in the outer membrane of our cells and send toxic molecules packing back out into intercellular space .
Oncologists have tried , with limited success , to reduce chemotherapy resistance by knocking out these pumps with more drugs , but the cell is able to stay ahead of the game by making more and more P - glycoprotein .
The Japanese researchers came to this problem hoping to find new drug - resistance genes that could be treatment targets .
They started off by comparing breast cancer tissue samples from drug - resistant and non-resistant tumors , and they observed that drug - resistant breast cancer tumors express high levels of a gene called RPN2 .
Thus , RPN2 may have something to do with making breast cancers docetaxel resistant , but what do we do with this knowledge ?
To dig deeper , the scientists moved from human tumor samples to petri dishes .
Cells cultured in a petri dish offer a virtually unlimited supply of material for experiments aimed at unraveling the molecular details of cancer .
The Japanese researchers used some widely available breast cancer cell lines - petri-dish cells obtained by taking tumor samples and coaxing them to proliferate indefinitely in the lab .
Once such cell lines are established , they can be shared around the world , and researchers can treat these cells with drugs , break them up and analyze their genes , or even inject them into mice and study their tumor - forming properties .
Now that the scientists had identified RPN2 as a possible source of drug resistance , they knocked out RPN2 in their petri dish cells and looked at what happened .
They took a line of docetaxel - resistant breast cancer cells and treated it with a gene - knockdown agent called siRNA .
An siRNA is a little snippet of nucleic acid that is able eliminate the RNA template necessary for making a particular protein .
In this case , RPN2 siRNA eliminated any RPN2 template floating around , thus preventing any Rpn2 protein from being made .
And as the researchers had hoped , once RPN2 was knocked down , the petri dish cells were now sensitive to docetaxel .
Knocking out RPN2 somehow let docetaxel get around the toxic waste disposal system .
How Does It Work ?
This result is exciting , but how does it work ?
The function of RPN2 offered the researchers a clue : RPN2 puts sugars on proteins .
P - glycoprotein is one protein that is heavily decorated by sugars .
These sugars play two major roles : they are involved in quality control , and they help make sure P - glycoprotein ends up in the right place in the cell , on the outer membrane .
If the sugars on P - glycoprotein are n't right , then P - glycoprotein does n't make it out to the membrane , and it also gets scrapped by the quality control process of the protein manufacturing system .
When the scientists knocked out RPN2 , they found that P - glycoprotein was n't making it to the membrane .
And this is n't just true in a petri dish .
The researchers also checked P - glycoprotein in their tumor tissue samples .
Tumor cells that were docetaxel resistant , which had high levels of RPN2 , also had a lot of P - glycoprotein in the membrane .
Tumor cells that were sensitive to docetaxel had low levels of RPN2 , and P - glycoprotein was not found in the membrane .
This correlation is explained by the results found in the petri dish cell lines - knock out RPN2 , and you prevent P - glycoprotein from doing its job as a membrane - embedded toxic waste pump .
Curing Mice with Breast Cancer
The Japanese group took this one step further .
They injected their cancer cell lines into mice , where those cells went on to form tumors .
In essence , they gave these mice breast cancer .
Mice that were treated with RPN2 siRNA ( knocking down RPN2 gene expression ) and docetaxel did much better than mice that were treated with just docetaxel .
Knocking out RPN2 in live mice produced the same effect observed in a petri dish .
What about Curing Humans ?
The Japanese group has laid the groundwork for moving this treatment into humans .
They have extensively tested their ideas in the lab , so what about the clinic ?
An immediate benefit is better prediction of docetaxel resistance - physicians can now know do a better job predicting which of their patients will benefit from docetaxel , and which should be spared the suffering caused by an ineffective drug .
But getting the siRNA treatment to work in humans is a more difficult problem ( and the subject for another column ) .
This kind of treatment is known as gene therapy .
After a rocky start , gene therapy is making some slow strides forward .
The advantage is that gene therapy can hit molecular targets that are tough to get at with drugs .
Gene therapy is also more targeted towards specific genes , while drugs are more indiscriminate in their molecular attacks .
It is possible that targeting RPN2 wo n't work better than past drugs targeting P - glycoprotein directly .
But two results of this Japanese study offer hope .
First , it seems better to hit P - glycoprotein during the protein manufacturing process , rather than stopping it later on .
The scientists , in addition to knocking down RPN2 , tried hitting one particular P - glycoprotein with an siRNA treatment ; that approach did n't work nearly as well as knocking down RPN2 .
And second , RPN2 , like most genes , has multiple roles , one of which may include regulating cell suicide proteins .
If you increase cell suicide in a tumor , your tumor shrinks .
So by hitting RPN2 , you may be hitting two birds with one stone : shutting down the toxic waste disposal system and promoting cell suicide .
Fighting cancer is a long slog with few magic bullets .
But the bullets do n't need to be magic , they just need to be more effective , and studies like this are going to steadily increase our anti-cancer arsenal .
And just maybe , as gene therapy becomes more feasible , that arsenal may some day be stocked with a little magic .
A neuron ’s perspective : A neuron receives input from an external stimulus via glutamate , providing current information about the external world ( layer one ) .
The neuron uses prior information ( layer two ) to predict the conductance of layer one .
The difference between layer two ’s expected output of layer one and the actual output of layer one is the membrane voltage , which signals prediction error , and helps the neuron learn about the world .

If you want to understand and predict the behavior of your young daughter , explains neurobiologist Christopher Fiorillo , you might observe how she reacts to various environmental factors .
Then , using a statistical analysis , you might try to determine a relationship between her behavior and these external factors .
However , an easier and quicker way might be simply to try to understand what the child herself knows about her world .
Although young children have similar basic goals , they behave differently from one another because they have different information about the world .
This idea , known to psychologists as the theory of mind , is the basis for a new theory of brain function proposed by Fiorillo , a researcher at Stanford University .
His model attempts to provide an understanding of the nervous system by looking at the world from a neuron ’s perspective .
This “ first - person ” approach differs from the conventional “ third - person ” approach to understanding the nervous system , which is based on observing inputs and outputs and trying to figure out the relationship between the two .
“ The problem [ with the conventional approach ] is that the relationship between inputs and outputs is very complicated , even for a single neuron , ” Fiorillo told PhysOrg.com .
“ By contrast , I have tried to figure out what a neuron knows about the world .
This is possible because we already know a great deal about the biophysical properties of neurons .
I think that if we can figure out what information a neuron has , then we will be able to make better sense of its inputs and outputs .
I think that this approach to information will prove to be very useful , regardless of the success of the rest of the theory . ”
Learning neurons
Fiorillo ’s theory attempts to explain the computational function of the nervous system .
Although much progress has been made in understanding the mechanics of the nervous system , there is still no general theory of its computational function .
In other words , scientists do n’t understand how a system made up of simple , tiny neurons can compute information as a complex , intelligent , and holistic system .
In the absence of a computational theory , scientists and engineers have been limited in their ability to design artificial systems that mimic the intelligence of biological systems .
In Fiorillo ’s model , each of the billions of neurons in the nervous system shares the same basic computational function .
Also , a neuron ’s function mirrors the function of the system as a whole .
After all , Fiorillo explains , the entire system originally developed from a single cell .
However , even though neurons may use the same general computation method , they still have differences , since the information that a neuron has is the result of the particular statistical pattern of inputs to which it has been exposed .
Since different neurons develop in different environments , each neuron acquires its own unique set of information .
In the model , the nervous system is united by a common computational “ goal ” of promoting the future of an individual ’s genetic information by selecting the most advantageous behaviors , or outputs .
To do this , a neuron compares an external stimulus to its own internal prior information sources .
The neuron produces an output signal when the stimulus intensity exceeds its expectation ( i.e. when there is a difference between what the neuron expects and what it actually senses ) .
This output signal is called a “ prediction error ” and it is used to teach the neuron and its target neurons what ’s new about the world .
By maximizing its prediction errors , the neuron learns things that can ultimately help it achieve its biological goals .
Neuron - to - neuron signaling
The physical way this works , Fiorillo explains , is that a neuron ’s membrane voltage depends on the flow of current though its ion channels .
A neuron has multiple groups of ion channels , with each group attending to information from a particular region of space or period of the past .
Some groups of ion channels focus on providing current “ sensory ” information ( such as glutamate - regulated ion channels at synapses ) , whereas others focus on prior information ( such as voltage - regulated potassium channels ) .
The difference between the neuron ’s current and prior information determines its membrane voltage , which is the output signal that the neuron sends to the next neuron , and so on down the chain of neurons .
Because the stimulus of each neuron is selected under the influence of reward feedback , the further a neuron is from the system ’s sensory input , the more informative its stimulus is about the abstract notion of reward and the less informative its stimulus is about the concrete sensory world .
As the “ last ” neuron in the circuit , a motor neuron has the most information and the least uncertainty about reward , so it ’s appropriate that the motor neuron determines the system ’s output .
As Fiorillo explained , the anatomy of the nervous system supports this proposal .
For example , scientists know that taste is usually a better predictor of future reward than light intensity .
Appropriately , there are fewer neurons lying between the gustatory cells in the tongue and motor neurons , than there are between photoreceptor cells in the eye and motor neurons .
“ A great deal of past work has focused on how neurons form synaptic connections with one another , ” Fiorillo said .
“ However , a neuron has many inputs that are not synaptic but are instead mediated by non-synaptic ion channels .
The computational function of these channels has not been well understood , and these channels are often completely absent in the neurons of artificial neural networks .
“ I propose that the function of these ion channels in the temporal domain is analogous to the function of synapses in the spatial domain .
A synapse , like the neuron from which it originates , is dedicated to a particular region of space .
A neuron has many potential synapses , and by choosing its synapses it can choose which regions of space are the most interesting .
Similarly , a neuron has many different non-synaptic ion channels ( particularly potassium channels ) encoded in its genome , and it chooses to express only a small number .
These channels are known to differ from one another in their kinetic properties ( how rapidly they change in response to changes in voltage ) .
Thus , different channels remember different periods of the past .
What I propose is that a neuron selects which of these channels to express in fundamentally the same way that it selects its synaptic inputs .
I propose that a neuron selects those channels , or those memories of the past , that are the best predictors of its current synaptic input .
These channels would therefore allow a neuron to make predictions through time . ”
Neurological applications
Although the model is simple and provides an elegant explanation for the complexity of the nervous system , there are still questions regarding its accuracy .
For instance , the model could hold true for some neurons but not others , and it may only account for a portion of neuronal variation .
It may be possible to test the model by determining how well it predicts the synaptic connectivity of neurons that have developed in an environment with a known statistical structure .
But because of our general ignorance of the statistical structure of the world , it may be difficult to easily confirm or reject the model overall .
Whether or not the model is accurate for biological systems , however , it might still prove useful as a computational framework for designing artificial neural networks .
Because the system learns for itself , without the need for “ built - in ” information , it could lead to intelligent systems that can learn from their environments .
“ Perhaps the most exciting aspect of understanding the computational function of the nervous system would be that , at least in principle , it would allow us to build an artificial system that exhibits the same sort of intelligence as biological systems , ” Fiorillo said .
“ However , it is important to recognize that even small nervous systems contain an enormous amount of information , and building a comparable artificial system would not be easy even if we understood all the computational principles .
I think that it would be best to start with relatively small systems .
I think the nervous system of an insect has far more information and is far more intelligent than any artificial system that we have today . ”
He added that a computational understanding of the nervous system could also be helpful in treating disorders of the nervous system .
“ Many neurological and psychiatric conditions are thought to result from inappropriate connectivity between neurons , ” he said .
“ If this computational theory is correct , then it could allow us to determine what a neuron 's connectivity should be in order for the system to function properly .
It also suggests how we might be able to change a neuron 's connectivity by altering the activity of its inputs and outputs . ”

The final night drew the largest audience so far for the Democrats ( 24.5 % of all American homes ) , eclipsing the audience reach the three previous evenings .
Also , from TV Week , note the Lieberman review :
The second day of the Republican National Convention ended with NBC ’s prime - time special winning a competition of small audiences .
According to preliminary national data from Nielsen Media Research , the three broadcast networks combined racked up a viewership of less than 11 million viewers , compared with the 14.8 million viewers who watched the networks ’ coverage on the comparable night of the GOP gathering in 2004 .
That 's also down from the 12.48 million who watched Senator Hillary Clinton ’s call for unity among Democrats last week at that party 's convention in Denver .
Two factors are worth noting : Hurricane Gustav 's assault on Louisiana had essentially set back the Republicans ’ attempts to get momentum by a day .
Also , Democrat - turned - Independent Sen. Joe Lieberman ’s speech , which closed the GOP show in St. Paul , Minn .
Tuesday night , was not expected to be a stem - winder — and it lived up to expectations .

The folks at Gekkomat have taken us into a future that not only improves exponentially on the plunger device , but may also bring a series of spectacular and comedic deaths into the world .

The device was supposedly inspired by the gecko , whose climbing ability the company wanted to duplicate " as naturally as possible . "
By " naturally " , they mean with four huge vacuum pads , a computer and a big tank of compressed air .
This gecko is only able to adhere to this tree by means of a hidden air tank and a computer .
The Gekkomat is an awesome concept , no doubt , but the makers themselves have difficulty explaining its usefulness .
The website suggests it could be used as a lifesaving device , or just for any old time when you need to scale a big wall .
They stop short of saying " to steal stuff or look at naked women . "

The Gekkomat can hold up to a ton of weight ( like if you want to steal a grand piano from a penthouse apartment , we guess ) , but is probably only meant for quick smash and grab jobs .
Why ?
The tank only holds enough air for about 30 minutes of climbing .
Built - in sensors let you know when errors have occured and , says Gekkomat , " alternatives to solve the situation are offered by the computer . "
The Connecticut Supreme Court just released its decision in the case of Kerrigan v. Commissioner of Public Health .
By a 4 - 3 decision , the Court ruled that same - sex couples have the right to marry :
We conclude that , in light of the history of pernicious discrimination faced by gay men and lesbians , and because the institution of marriage carries with it a status and significance that the newly created classification of civil unions does not embody , the segregation of heterosexual and homosexual couples into separate institutions constitutes a cognizable harm .
Just got this via email from State Rep. Mike Lawlor , who is the long - serving House Chair of the Connecticut Legislature ’s Judiciary Committee .
He applauded the decision and provided some key historical background , noting the Connecticut legislature will pass marriage equality :
The State of Connecticut has a bipartisan history of supporting equality for all citizens , gay and straight .
In 2005 , our state legislature passed civil unions , which granted full state marriage rights to same - sex couples , but only under a different name .
That law passed with overwhelming bipartisan support and was signed into law by Republican Governor M. Jodi Rell .
Connecticut became the first state in the nation to grant full marriage rights to same - sex couples without a court order to do so .
In 2007 , the legislature ’s Judiciary Committee successfully passed a bill to change the name of “ civil unions ” to “ marriage . ”
That bill came out of the committee on a bipartisan , 27 - 15 vote .
In fact , 25 % of all the members of the legislature sit on that committee .
All of Connecticut ’s political leaders , Democrat and Republican , have supported equal rights for gays and lesbians .
All of our members of Congress support this as well .
For example , Chris Shays , our state ’s only Republican congressman , has spoken numerous times about his support for full same - sex marriage rights and has said that if he was a member of the state legislature he would vote in its favor .
For nine years , Connecticut ’s legislature and courts have been moving along the same path towards full equality for gays and lesbians .
It is almost certain that the 2009 session of the legislature will vote to support marriage equality .
The Supreme Court said our constitution requires it .
The legislature will do it because it is the right thing to do .
In Connecticut , this has been a bipartisan effort from the start and I ’m sure the next legislature will overwhelmingly endorse today ’s ruling .
UPDATE : Connecticut ’s Republican Governor , Jodi Rell , wo n’t fight the ruling :
The dominant media storyline about the Iraq war holds that the decisions about how to conduct it pitted ignorant civilians -- especially the president and secretary of defense -- against the uniformed military , whose wise and sober advice was cavalierly ignored .
The Bush administration 's cardinal sin was interference in predominantly military affairs , starting with overruling the military on the size of the force that invaded Iraq in March 2003 .
But it 's not just the media that peddles this story .
As Bob Woodward illustrates ...
The New Jersey Board of Public Utilities is expected to vote next week on a $ 19 million plan to generate 350 megawatts of electricity with nearly 300 new wind turbines to be installed at various offshore locations .
One part of Gov. Jon S. Corzine ’s Energy Master Plan for the state , the wind turbine plan could make New Jersey the first state in the U.S. to get energy from offshore wind ( though that distinction could still go to Delaware , which OK’d a similar plan this summer ) , according to an article in NorthJersey.com .
Once installed , the offshore turbines could provide enough energy for half the homes in North Jersey , the article stated .
The primary goal of New Jersey ’s Energy Master Plan is to “ reduce projected energy use by 20 percent by 2020 and meet 20 percent of the state ’s electricity needs with Class 1 renewable energy sources by 2020 , ” according to the state ’s Website .
Five companies are vying for the chance to build the offshore wind farms : Environmental Technologies LLC , Fishermen ’s Energy of New Jersey LLC , Garden State Offshore Energy , Occidental Development and Equities LLC and Bluewater Wind .
Stay tuned here for an outcome of the utilities board decision .
Meanwhile , to learn more about the proposed offshore installments , see the State of New Jersey ’s Website for its Energy Master Plan , NorthJersey.com and New Jersey ’s Clean Energy Program .

Jewish Republicans try to read Palin tea leaves
Based on anecdotal evidence in a community I 've covered for years , Sarah Palin 's nomination has generated a bit of backlash among Jewish voters .
Where John McCain was making inroads for his place in the secular , hawkish wing of the GOP , and where there were doubts about Obama , there 's now concern and viral e-mails about Palin .
Some , on little evidence , paint her as a Buchanan acolyte ; others accurately point out that she , unlike McCain , hails from the evangelical Christian wing of her party , which would like to see more overt displays of Christianity in the public square .
( There 's a minority of observant Jews who would also prefer this , but this — and vehement anti-abortion stance — lose you a lot more Jewish votes than it wins . )
In any case , at the heart of this — as of so much about her — is the almost complete absence of evidence of her views on this issue .
Aside from signing an boilerplate Israel - Alaska friendship resolution , Palin does n't have a paper trail on Middle East politics , and she has n't been to Israel .
Her Alaska Jewish allies I spoke to had no recollection of discussing the issue with her in detail .
Meanwhile , two Jewish Obama fundraisers have told me since the Palin pick that they 've seen Jewish donors moving to Obama .
More evidence that this is a problem :
The Republican Jewish Coalition today blasted out the best evidence it had that Palin is a friend of Israel .
That would be the small Israeli flag jutting out from behind her drapes in the screen grab above from a video interview on another topic .
" I think it speaks volumes that she keeps an Israeli flag on the wall of her office , " the group 's executive director , Matt Brooks , explained in an e-mail to Politico .
" It clearly shows what 's in her heart .
For those who had questions about her views or whether these issues were on her ' radar screen ' they will be very comforted by this fact . "
Brooks has a point , surely ; a Palestinian flag would have told a different story .
But tiny Israeli flags are hardly unusual in the offices of American politicians , including those ( known as Democrats ) that the RJC regularly criticizes .
And the fact that this tiny image is the best the official voice of Republican Jewry has to defend Palin is a mark that McCain may have just helped solve Obama 's Jewish problem .
Paws for thought :
Pet dog fitted with £ 10,000 bionic leg
A beloved pet bulldog has been fitted with a £ 10,000 bionic leg , which will help advance prosthetic techniques used to help bombing victims .
Coal , an eight - and - a - half year old hound had his left paw amputated because of cancer last year .
He faced being put down because his other legs would be too weak to carry him .
Coal is back on his feet again after he underwent revolutionary false limb surgery pioneered on victims of the 7/7 London bombings
But his determined owner Reg Walker , shelled out thousands of pounds to fit him with a sophisticated bionic leg , which was designed to be compatible with Coal 's own tissue .
The titanium alloy used mimics animal hide , allowing the skin and the bone from above to seal the metal implant below without it being rejected by the body .
It is only the second time such an operation had been performed on an animal , using a technique performed on a survivor of the London 7/7 bombings .
Man 's best friend : Reg Walker ( l ) was determined to give Coal a second chance with a bionic limb ( r )
Vet Noel Fitzpatrick told the Enfield Independent : ' This is unique in that its the world 's only implant into which skin and bone grow .
It is the holy grail of research .
' If you have an accident and your bone sticks out through your shin , skin will try to grow round it .
People have been trying for this for years and years - because with this we get an umbrella of skin attached to the metal . '
Mr Walker , who is a music industry security guard was thrilled with the results .
He said : ' When I found out about Coal I was gutted .
He goes everywhere with me - he goes on tour , he 's the only dog to have allowed into Live 8 and the only dog that has ever been backstage at the Royal Albert Hall .
' Now he has an absolutely normal quality of life , which he would n't have had before . '
In his weekly radio address on Saturday , President Bush said Congress was ignoring the American public ’s wishes by not expanding offshore drilling on the outer continental shelf .
“ If members of Congress do not support the American people at the gas pump , then they should not expect the American people to support them at the ballot box , ” Bush warned .
President Bush said before members of Congress begin their heavy campaigning , they should n’t leave Washington without addressing high gas prices .
“ At the very least , ” the President suggested , “ Congress should take action on three common sense energy solutions that enjoy bipartisan support . ”
Those are :
Open the way for environmentally responsible oil exploration on the outer continental shelf .
Expand access to oil shale .
Extend renewable power tax credits .
Make credits long term and expand them to cover all forms of low - emission power generation – including nuclear .
It appears as though Democrats have indeed moved a little on the offshore drilling issue , mostly so they can get through a broader energy policy that would include extensions of the federal tax credits for renewable energy .
I ’m less certain , however , how well either oil - shale or nuclear will fare .
There is a good chance that there will be some broad - based energy legislation brought to the floor of the House in the next week or two .
According an article in Saturday ’s Washington Post :
“ The proposal would allow oil and gas drilling in federal waters off the Atlantic Coast from Virginia to Georgia and off Florida in the eastern Gulf of Mexico with a 50 - mile protected buffer from shore according to the aide .
States would be allowed to “ opt in ” to drilling in federal waters off their coasts if they choose to do so with a portion of the royalties going to the states . ”

McCain ’s policy on Russia gets slightly less coherent ( yes , that ’s possible )
In March , in his first major address on foreign policy , John McCain stated his intention to kick Russia out of the G - 8 .
In rather belligerent tones , reminiscent of the Cold War , McCain blasted Russia and suggested the country is no longer a democracy .
The policy always seemed like a very bad idea , and the foreign policy establishment could n’t imagine what on earth McCain was talking about .
What ’s more , it was n’t just an unscripted response at a town - hall meeting ; this was McCain reading from a prepared text in a high - profile speech .
In June , the McCain campaign said the senator no longer believes what he said .
A McCain adviser told McClatchy that the candidate ’s policy on Russia and the G - 8 as “ a holdover from an earlier period , ” adding , “ It does n’t reflect where he is right now . ”
Yesterday , on “ This Week , ” George Stephanopoulos , to his credit , asked where McCain is on the subject today .
STEPHANOPOULOS : Let me ask you about your position to exclude Russia from the G - 8 .
How are you going to get that done ?
Every other G - 8 nation is against it .
MCCAIN : Well , you have to take positions whether other nations agree or not , because you have to do what ’s best for America … .
In the last week or so , look at Russia ’s actions .
They cut back on their oil supplies to the Czechs , because the Czechs made an agreement with us .
They have now thrown out the — or forced out — BP out of Russia .
And by the way , I — a lot of us thought that might happen .
They continue to put enormous pressures on Georgia in many ways .
They ’re putting pressure on Ukraine .
They are blocking action in the United Nations Security Council on Iran .
And so …
STEPHANOPOULOS : But how is kicking out of the G - 8 going to make that better ?
We need them … to help secure nuclear weapons .
We need them to help contain Iran .
To kick them out is going to make it harder , is n’t it ?
MCCAIN : We need to improve their behavior .
Asked specifically how McCain , as a practical matter , could exclude Russia from the G8 when every other country in the G8 is against the idea , McCain started spouting obvious nonsense .
MCCAIN : I will stand up for what I think is the best for the United States of America and the world , the way that Ronald Reagan went to Berlin and said , “ Tear down this wall . ”
And they said , “ Oh , he ’s a cowboy .
He ’s going to make relations worse .
He should n’t say that . ”
And yet , we wanted the Wall down .
We want better Russian behavior internationally .
And we have every right to expect it .
None of this makes any sense at all .
McCain sounds like a college freshman , trying to b.s. his way through Foreign Policy 101 — and he ’s failing .
This is n’t especially complicated .
McCain was asked how , exactly , he ’d kick Russia out of the G8 .
He pointed to Reagan ’s “ Tear down this wall ” speech .
What does the latter have to do with the prior ?
Nothing .
It ’s policy gibberish .
Given how the G8 works — through consensus — Russia would have to approve its own removal .
A senior Bush administration official recently conceded , “ It ’s not even a theoretical discussion .
It ’s an impossible discussion . ”
The official described McCain ’s idea as “ just a dumb thing . ”
But practicality aside , there ’s the more important issue of what makes McCain think this is a good policy .
Aside from that , many wonder whether McCain ’s suggestion would be wise policy .
They fear that if McCain is elected and follows through on an attempt to toss Russia from the group , it could anger and isolate Russia , which has been increasingly assertive on the world stage , autocratic within its borders and is the second - largest producer of the hydrocarbons that feed the world ’s energy needs .
“ In Europe , there ’s very little support … for a policy like that , ” said Stephen Larrabee , an expert on Europe and Russia at the RAND think tank .
“ It ’s too late in the game to try and oust Russia . ”
The proposal also seemed at odds with the theme of McCain ’s speech , which promised a less unilateral approach to world affairs than the Bush White House has pursued .
That could reflect tension between two Republican foreign - policy camps vying for influence in McCain ’s campaign : the pragmatic realists and the hard - line neo- conservatives — with the neo-cons ascendant for now in Russia policy .
“ There are a lot of important issues that we need Russia ’s support on … .
What ’s to be gained by tossing Russia out ?
We feel more self - righteous about ourselves ? ” said Andrew Kuchins , the director of the Russia and Eurasia program at the Center for International and Strategic Studies , a center - right think tank .
Fareed Zakaria also explained recently why McCain seems to have Russian policy backwards .
What McCain has announced is momentous — that the United States should adopt a policy of active exclusion and hostility toward two major global powers .
It would reverse a decades - old bipartisan American policy of integrating these two countries into the global order , a policy that began under Richard Nixon ( with Beijing ) and continued under Ronald Reagan ( with Moscow ) .
It is a policy that would alienate many countries in Europe and Asia who would see it as an attempt by Washington to begin a new cold war . [ … ]
The single most important security problem that the United States faces is securing loose nuclear materials .
A terrorist group can pose an existential threat to the global order only by getting hold of such material .
We also have an interest in stopping proliferation , particularly by rogue regimes like Iran and North Korea .
To achieve both of these core objectives — which would make American safe and the world more secure — we need Russian cooperation .
How fulsome is that likely to be if we gratuitously initiate hostilities with Moscow ?
Dissing dictators might make for a stirring speech , but ordinary Americans will have to live with the complications after the applause dies down .
Let ’s all say it together : McCain has no idea what he ’s talking about .
Embedded video from CNN Video
I just finished watching the debate and agree , Obama had a good evening .
What I liked was CNN ’s meter at the bottom of the screen as the candidates spoke .
Every time McCain went nasty or grumpy ( and he did it a lot ) the numbers plummeted for Democrats , Republicans and more importantly Independents .
Looks like everyone knows the real John McCain .
Fed 's Fisher Says FOMC Cannot Risk Credibility , Must Act if Inflation Continues
The Federal Reserve must be prepared to take action and curb inflation if slowing growth does n't moderate prices as expected , said the most hawkish member of the FOMC on Tuesday .
Dallas Fed President ( voter ) , who has dissented from keeping interest rates on hold at the last two FOMC meetings , said the Fed will put its credibility at risk if it fails to combat inflation .
He said the Fed has fulfilled its mandate to promote growth by cutting rates rapidly and taking efforts to stabilize credit markets ; and though GDP is expected slow to a " snail 's pace " in the second half of 2008 , rising inflation cannot be ignored .
" [ W ]e have to be keenly aware of the consequences of our actions for inflation .
We have a dual mandate - the operative words modifying growth are ' sustainable ' and ' noninflationary ' - and we are duty bound to deliver upon it , " he said in Aspen , Colorado .
Fisher said the FOMC will not " gamble " away the Fed 's credibility to bolster economic growth .
" [ U ] ntil we have a clear sense of what will prevail , monetary policy makers must remain poised to act if slowing growth fails to contain inflationary pressures , " he said .
Unless inflation moderates soon , the U.S. risks reinforcing the spreading of inflationary impulses and expectations , he said .
" Should this happen and the Fed were to fail to address it , we would run the risk of losing the public 's confidence in our ability to constrain inflation . "
In a question and answer session after his speech , Fisher said that he was not surprised by the U.S. dollar 's recovery .
He added it was too soon to tell about the impact of the U.S. dollar on inflation .
Fisher noted that the current interest rates are very low and the Fed is working to " get things right " .
Fisher warned that it is very dangerous to let prices get out of control , adding that the Fed 's liquidity programs are a temporary way to deal with the " frozen " credit markets .
Fisher said that the loan programs would unwind when necessary .
Fisher commented on interest rate policy , stating that any rate hike will not slow the recovery of credit markets .
Fisher added that Fed may have to raise rates sooner than most expect .
Fisher said the Fed 's actions have unblocked the markets and reduced risk , adding that the Fed should push recovery without high inflation .

If you 've been following along , you are probably already aware the Pinax team has decided to make some radical changes to their directory structure based on input from users .
I took the time to update my own Pinax project — let me show you what 's changed .
First , here 's the new directory structure , straight from the README file :
projects / complete_project / a complete sample project and templates basic_project / a more basic starter project ( still to come ) apps / external_apps / external re-usable apps via svn:externals local_apps / re-usable apps that are n't yet externalized core_apps / non re-usable apps specific to sample project libs / external_libs / external libraries docs / documentation ( in progress ) fixtures / test fixtures ( in progress )
As you can see , the application directories have been put into their own structure and a directory for libraries was added .
Basically , the space is less flat now .
The projects directory contains sample projects .
The manage .py executable in these project directories are designed to automatically include the previously mentioned library and application directories in the appropriate paths .
I 've already made the changes to my project to include the new directory structure .
What I 've done is removed the top level externals ( core_apps , external_apps , external_libs , local_apps ) and replaced the with two new externals : apps and libs .
Once that was done , I edited my manage .py to accommodate the new directories .
Here 's a unified diff to give you an idea .

Never in history have so many people had so much information , so many tools at their disposal , so many ways of making good ideas come to life .
Yet at the same time , so many people , of all walks of life , could use so much help , in both little ways and big .
In the midst of this , new studies are reinforcing the simple wisdom that beyond a certain very basic level of material wealth , the only thing that increases individual happiness over time is helping other people .

可逆データ圧縮としてはgzipやlha , pngなどダントツで使われているLZ法（Lemple Ziv法）ですが、他のデータ圧縮法（BWT法、PPM法、CM法）に比べ圧縮率が低いということで研究の対象としてはあまり注目をあびていませんでした。ところが次の論文で真面目にやれば圧縮率は非常に高くなる可能性があり、BWT法とかそれを超える可能性があることが示されています。。
" On the bit - complexity of Lempel - Ziv compression " , SODA 2009 , P. Ferragina , et. al. [ pdf ]
まず、LZ法についておさらいですが、基本的にはデータを前から順番に見ていったときに、既に出現した文字列がもう一度出現（マッチング）したら、その文字列を前回出現した（相対）位置と長さのペア(pos , len ) で置き換えることで圧縮する方法です。データには大抵繰り返しが多く出現するので、保存サイズを減らすことができます。例えば、abracadabraという文字列はabr(
3,1 )
c( 2,1) d( 7,4 ) となります。(3,1)は3文字前から1文字コピーするという意味で、初めて出現する文字をそのまま書いています。
これは厳密に はLZSS法といわれるもので他にもたくさん変種がありますが基本的にはこのアイディアに基づいています。
この入力文字列を以前出現した文字に置き換えていく作業は部分文字列に分解するようにみえるので、lz-factorizationと最近では呼んだりします。先ほどのは abr a c a d abraとなります（圧縮以外にもパターンマイニングなどいろいろな利用用途があることが分かっている）
現在のlz法の殆どの実装では、以前出現したかどうかを調べる部分を近似的に行っています。近似的というのは、一つは長い文字列は見つけようとはするが、必ずしも最長一致を見つけていないということ、もう一つは同じ一致長のマッチングの中でも一番近い最右のものを見つけていないことです。近いマッチングを見つけることができれば一致情報を表すのに小さい数字を使えばよく、必要な符号長を減らすことができます。
現在のlz法の実装は大抵、数文字使ったハッシュを利用してマッチングの候補を見つけ、そこから伸ばしていくか、今まで見た文脈を適当に間引いてtrieを作って探索しているかです。まじめに最長＆最右一致を探そうとすると、単純な実装では計算量は爆発します。
さらに、マッチングを探す場合に過去の文脈全てを見ると計算量＋作業領域量が大きくなるので決められた範囲内だけ（たとえば現在の位置から６４ＫＢだけからとか）からしかマッチングを調べないようになってます。
上記の論文でまず示したのは、上の三つの近似を取っ払って真面目に最長＆最右一致を全過去の文脈から探すと圧縮率は非常に高くなる、たとえばbwt法の最高の符号法の一つとほぼ同じところまで圧縮率が向上することです。lz法はbwt法やppm法と違って復元が(1)めちゃくちゃ速い
( 2)必要なメモリ量は文脈の分だけ
( 3)前から順番に復元できる（stream復元 , ppmもできるが）という三つの特徴を持ってるため、圧縮率がほぼ同じところにいけば、実用的にはかなり美味しくなります。
上記の論文ではさらに最適なparsingを求めることが現実的な計算量で求められることを示しています。例えば、上のparsingはgreedyな戦略、つまり毎回最長一致を探して置き換えていきますが、数文字スキップしたらもっと長いマッチングがあって全体は小さくできるかもしれません。この全体のサイズを小さくするようなparsingを求める問題は、重み付きDAGの最小重みパスを求める問題に帰着できるのは知られていますが、このDAGをほぼ線形もしくはO(nlogn)time , spaceで求められることを示しています。この最適なparsingを使うことで先ほどの最長＆最右一致よりも更に数％圧縮率を向上させることができます（詳しい数値は論文を参照してください）
で、少なくとも最長、最右一致が効率的に求められるだけでも嬉しいのですが、これだけでもかなり手ごわい問題です。メモリさえ許せばsuffix
treeなどを構築してマッチングを求めれば最長、最右一致はほぼ線形時間で求まりますが、全履歴、少なくとも100MB分ぐらいはみたいということでメモリ量がかなりシビアです。
この問題はまさに私が先日発表した手法で解けそうなのですが、いくつかまだ壁があるところで、時間を見つけてはちまちまやってます。

OXFORD , Mississippi ( CNN ) --
A national poll of people who watched the first presidential debate suggests that Barack Obama came out on top , but there was overwhelming agreement that both Obama and John McCain would be able to handle the job of president if elected .
The CNN / Opinion Research Corp. survey is not a measurement of the views of all Americans , since only people who watched the debate were questioned and the audience included more Democrats than Republicans .
Fifty - one percent of those polled thought Obama did the better job in Friday night 's debate , while 38 percent said John McCain did better .
Men were nearly evenly split between the two candidates , with 46 percent giving the win to McCain and 43 percent to Obama .
But women voters tended to give Obama higher marks , with 59 percent calling him the night 's winner , while just 31 percent said McCain won .
" It can be reasonably concluded , especially after accounting for the slight Democratic bias in the survey , that we witnessed a tie in Mississippi tonight , " CNN Senior Political Researcher Alan Silverleib said .
" But given the direction of the campaign over the last couple of weeks , a tie translates to a win for Obama . "
Watch entire debate : Part 1 » | Part 2 » | Part 3 »
McCain apparently failed to get the " game changer " he needed to reverse his deficit in the polls , Silverleib said .
Grade the candidates ' performances in the debate
Both candidates appeared to exceed expectations .
McCain did better than expected in the minds of 60 percent , while 57 percent said Obama did a better job in the debate than they expected .
Twenty percent said both candidates did worse than expected .
iReport.com : Who do you think won the debate ?
More than two - thirds of debate watchers agreed that both McCain and Obama would be able to handle the job of president if elected .
National security has been an issue where McCain has held an advantage , but his edge over Obama -- 49 percent to 45 percent -- on the question of which candidate would best handle terrorism is within the poll 's 4.5 percent margin of error .
Watch candidates discuss likelihood of another 9/11 »
The economy , which has been Obama 's terrain this cycle , dominated the first half of the debate .
Debate watchers gave him a 21 percentage point edge -- 58 to 37 percent -- on the question of which candidate would do a better job handling the economy .
By a similar margin , those polled said Obama would be better able to deal with the current financial crisis facing the nation .
Watch McCain , Obama discuss the economy »
The real impact of the debate may not be apparent right away .
" The real test will come in a few days when we see whether support for Obama or McCain changes in polls involving all voters , not just debate watchers , " said CNN Polling Director Keating Holland .
" In post - debate polls after the first faceoff in 2004 , John Kerry got virtually the same numbers as Obama did tonight .
Polls released a few days later showed Kerry gaining five points in the horse race . "
Good post - debate poll numbers do n't always spell success in the horse race , he said .
" Kerry also won the third debate in 2004 with the same numbers that Obama got in tonight 's poll , but his support dropped five points after that event , " Holland said .
Poll interviews were conducted with 524 adult Americans who watched the debate and were conducted by telephone on September 26 .
All interviews were done after the end of the debate .
The margin of error for the survey is plus or minus 4.5 percentage points .
The results may be favoring Obama simply because more Democrats than Republicans tuned in to the debate .
Of the debate - watchers questioned in this poll , 41 percent of the respondents identified themselves as Democrats , 27 percent as Republicans and 30 percent as independents .
The best estimate of the number of Democrats in the voting age population as a whole indicates that the sample is roughly 5 to 7 percentage points more Democratic than the population as a whole .

What was true and what was false from the first debate
The embassy attack in Kabul killed more than 50 people Pakistan 's government has denied that its spy service , the ISI , was involved in last month 's deadly bombing of the Indian embassy in Kabul .
Government spokeswoman Sherry Rehman was responding to media reports that Taleban sympathisers within the ISI had helped in the deadly attack .
She also said there would be no purge of the ISI .
This appeared to directly contradict an earlier statement which she made to the AP news agency .
Ms Rehman had been quoted as saying : " Years of backing an anti-Soviet jihad has left its mark .
It was in the past during the Soviet jihad that a few pro-Taleban elements had found their way in , and with the change in policy have been firmly been rooted out
Sherry Rehman ,
government spokeswoman
Spies challenge government " There are probably still individuals within the ISI who are ideologically sympathetic to the Taleban and act on their own in ways that are not in convergence with the policies and interests of the government of Pakistan .
" We need to identify these people and weed them out . "
However , Ms Rehman later said that she had been quoted out of context by the news agency .
Speaking shortly afterwards to the BBC Urdu service , she said : " There is no question of any purge in the ISI .
" The government has already stated that there are no links or evidence of ISI involvement in the Kabul bombing .
It was in the past during the Soviet jihad that a few pro-Taleban elements had found their way in , and with the change in policy have been firmly been rooted out . "
The BBC contacted Pakistan 's army spokesman Maj Gen Athar Abbas but he would not respond to Ms Rehman 's comments .
US allegations Other Pakistani officials roundly rejected any ISI involvement in the Kabul blast .
" It 's rubbish .
We totally deny it , " foreign ministry spokesman Mohammad Sadiq told AFP .
The embassy attack was the bloodiest in Kabul since 2001
When asked about the allegations as he attended a South Asian summit in Sri Lanka , Foreign Minister Shah Mehmood Qureshi also said it was " rubbish " .
The BBC's M Ilyas Khan in Karachi says that on several occasions in recent weeks Pakistan 's civilian government has embarrassed itself by issuing important orders and statements that it has had to retract within hours .
Last Saturday night it said the ISI would be brought under the control of the interior ministry .
But the decision was revoked within hours , apparently following intervention from the army .
More than 50 people were killed in the embassy blast in Kabul , including two senior Indian diplomats .
It was the bloodiest explosion in the Afghan capital since the Taleban were driven from power in 2001 .
US officials had claimed that spies in the ISI had helped plan the suicide attack .
The allegations - reportedly based on intercepted communications - were made in briefings to the New York Times and the Washington Post .
The New York Times reported that a senior CIA official had visited Pakistan last month to confront Islamabad over links between the ISI and Islamic extremists .

Thoughts on Banking By Arnold Kling
This post returns to the deep topic of banking theory .
I am very unhappy with the state of banking theory in economics .
People make very strong empirical claims about what they call the risk - taking process based on shallow thinking about that process .
I think that Mencius Moldbug is giving the wrong answer , but at least he is asking the right question , which is more than I can say for , well , just about the entire economics profession .
1 .
No information asymmetries
If you assume away information asymmetries , then I think you have two choices .
You can read and absorb the thinking of Fischer Black ; or you can build an ad hoc model that is fundamentally erroneous .
Essentially everything in the economics journals and in textbooks is in the latter category .
Let us return to a world where investment projects are fruit trees , which take time to mature and which involve risk .
The risk , which might be thought of as a disease that harms trees , does not strike every tree identically .
There is also an asset ( fruit ? ) that can be stored risk - free instantaneously .
An efficient portfolio of tree investments will have optimal risk - return characteristics for every investor , regardless of risk tolerance .
That is the Capital Asset Pricing Model , which says that the most efficient way to dial risk up or down is to change your weighting of the riskless asset and the efficient portfolio in your personal portfolio .
If you are particularly risk averse , you hold less of the market portfolio and more of the riskless asset .
Personal time horizons do not matter .
The fact that I might want to save for retirement five years from now means nothing .
The issue is my risk tolerance .
If I can tolerate lots of risk , I put a lot of my savings into the market portfolio .
If not , then I use the riskless asset .
Also , I can start out with a lot in the market portfolio , but if the market goes down I can re-allocate in favor of the riskless asset .
That way , I can limit my risk dynamically over time .
Banking is a simple service .
The bank keeps track of everyone ’s accounts .
Customers who have accumulated more wealth than they have spent have positive balances .
Customers who have spent more than they have accumulated have negative balances .
I do n’t think of the people with negative balances as over - stretched consumers ( although they could be ) .
I think of them as tree - planters .
Every instant , the bank calculates an interest rate on all of its accounts .
Interest is paid in fruit .
Customers who have positive balances receive interest .
Customers who have negative balances pay interest .
The bank gets a service fee from its customers to cover the cost of keeping the accounts straight .
The bank itself takes no risk .
It is just an accounting firm .
Let me elaborate on the last point .
Suppose that I am a fruit - tree planter with a negative balance .
My fruit tree , which does not yet bear fruit , nonetheless has a market value that exceeds my negative balance .
As time passes , suppose that the prospects for my fruit tree worsen .
The instant that the market value of my fruit tree threatens to drop below the value needed to cover my negative balance , the bank forecloses on my fruit tree .
I am forced to sell my fruit tree in time to ensure that the bank never loses money .
In fact , my wealth is not going to be concentrated in one fruit tree .
I am going to have shares in the market portfolio of fruit trees .
When the market portfolio falls in value , the bank will force me to liquidate my shares .
People who still have positive balances will not have to liquidate their portfolios .
Think of the economy as having two intermediaries .
One is a mutual fund that assembles the market portfolio of shares in fruit trees .
The other is a bank that handles people ’s accounts .
Customers take money out of the bank when they buy consumer goods or when they increase their investment in the market portfolio .
Customers put money into the bank when they earn wages or when they liquidate shares in the market portfolio .
The economy is subject to real business cycles .
As the saying goes , stuff happens .
The fruit trees suffer a lot from disease .
Everybody is poorer , with the biggest risk - takers suffering the most .
The bank does not fail .
But the value of shares in the mutual fund drops .
Fischer Black ’s model ends here .
If you ask why people do n’t all hold the same market portfolio , the answer is “ I do n’t know ' ”
If you ask why real - world banks operate in ways that allow them to fail , the answer is “ I do n’t know . ”
If you ask why people write long - term debt contracts , the answer is “ I do n’t know . ”
Fischer Black would argue that all of these observed deviations from his model are second - order phenomena .
To a first approximation , you can think of the economy as following a real - business - cycle model .
In the late 1990 ’s , rational investors thought that we needed to increase fiber capacity on the Internet by a factor of 1000 within three years .
It turned out they were “ way off , ” in the sense that it took several more years for Internet traffic to grow to the level that it was assumed to require in 2001 .
The result of that , and other risks that were rational ex ante , was a real business cycle slump from 2000 - 2002 .
Similarly , today we may suffer a loss of wealth because people made some calculations about the return on housing investment that , ex post , turned out poorly .
Stuff happens .
Nothing you can do about it .
Fischer Black ’s model can be defended as an “ as if ” story .
Yes , the real world differs in many ways .
But perhaps these are not important , and you can treat the real world as if it were following Black ’s model .
Instead , what economists tend to do is bring in arbitrary forms of financial intermediation ad hoc .
Nobody asks why banks are structured so that they can fail .
We just start with the assumption that they are so structured , and go from there .
Black might say that bank failures are the particular way that real business cycles manifest themselves in our economy .
They are second - order phenomena .
The first - order phenomena are the unavoidable risks that come from taking reasonable bets that work out badly due to chance .
2. Information Asymmetries
An alternative approach , which is quite difficult , is to try to start with information asymmetries .
Some people know more than other people about some things .
The pattern of financial intermediation is determined by these information asymmetries .
Recall that in Fischer Black ’s world , there is no reason for unstable banks to emerge .
The banks that should emerge should be banks that do not fail .
It is amazing , when you think about it , that just about every economist has an opinion about how to prevent bank failures , and yet not one of those opinions is based on a theory of why banks that can fail emerge in the first place .
They just start with the assumption that we have banks structured as they are , not as Fischer Black would predict them to be .
By thinking about information asymmetries , I hope to explain the mergence of the phenomenon of banks that can fail .
Only then can one make justifiable recommendations about what would be a safer banking system .
In fact , my guess is that our financial system is as complex as it is mostly because information has become increasingly specialized .
To anticipate conclusions before doing any analysis , my intuition is that the financial system cannot be “ fixed ” from the center for the same reason that the system is so complex in the first place .
Information is too diffuse to be managed centrally .
Trying to plan the financial system is as futile as Russia ’s attempts to plan agriculture and manufacturing under Communism .
But again , that is my intuition rushing ahead of the analysis .
My guess is that in our fruit tree economy , we will gradually add more and more financial intermediaries , each specializing in different types of information .
The information pattern will in turn determine the pattern of securities that is traded .
For example , suppose that we start with an entrepreneur who knows more than most people about growing fruit trees in a particular location .
That entrepreneur will want to plant fruit trees in that location .
The entrepreneur needs funds .
The entrepreneur could sell shares in his business , but nobody else knows what the shares are worth .
To save on information costs , the entrepreneur chooses to borrow funds and pay interest .
The lenders do not have to know exactly what the fruit trees are worth .
All they need to know is that they are worth more than enough to pay back the debt .
They are presumably worth more because the entrepreneur put in a lot of his own funds , as well as time , in addition to the borrowed money .
Over time , lenders start to compete with one another .
A lender realizes that by identifying low - risk fruit - tree entrepreneurs , it can lend at a slightly lower interest rate than competitors are offering but make a more reliable profit .
So the lender develops some capability for analyzing fruit tree businesses , although the lender will never know as much as the individual entrepreneur .
As the lender develops information about specific entrepreneurs , the relationship between that lender and those entrepreneurs starts to matter .
If the entrepreneur has to switch lenders , the entrepreneur will face a higher interest rate , because a new lender will know less about the entrepreneur ’s business .
In other words , it is costly for the entrepreneur to continuously search for a new lender .
Instead , the entrepreneur will prefer a long - term contract with a lender who understands the entrepreneur ’s business .
With a long - term contract , the lender and the entrepreneur share in the benefits of the lender ’s familiarity with the entrepreneur .
The lender ’s sources of funds do not necessarily want to engage in a long - term contract .
The lender would prefer to be supplied with long - term debt , but savers may prefer to keep short - term deposits with the lender .
Thus , the lender acts like a real - world bank , not a Fischer Black bank .
If the particular fruit tree projects turn out badly , the lender may fail .
Moreover , if customers believe that the fruit tree projects that this bank is backing are not going to do well , then customers may start a run on this bank .
A genuine fruit tree failure is a solvency crisis .
A rumored fruit tree failure is a liquidity crisis .
Given the information asymmetries , either type of crisis is possible .
Deposit insurance can greatly reduce the risk of a liquidity crisis , but it cannot prevent a solvency crisis .
Government - run deposit insurance acts like an asset on the bank ’s books that can be trusted by depositors .
There are other possible assets .
Private insurance could be one such asset .
Reserves could be another asset .
Highly - marketable loans ( loans where the bank ’s inside information is not terribly costly for other banks to verify ) could be another asset that would reassure depositors , because such liquid assets can be tapped in order to stem a bank run .
As we are learning today , there are many types of financial intermediaries that are important .
Some of them , such as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , suffered the equivalent of bank runs .
In addition , some of them may be insolvent .
It is probably not practical for government to insure the liabilities of all of these intermediaries .
On the other hand , government officials fear the consequences of not insuring their liabilities .
The rules of the financial system used to be : certain bank liabilities are insured ( deposits up to $ 100 K ) ; other corporate liabilities typically uninsured ; some liabilities unclear ( Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae ; large deposits or debt issued by banks ) .
Under the new rules , a larger set of liabilities is insured .
I think that one consequence of that will be to reduce the competitive viability of intermediaries that issue uninsured liabilities .
All of a sudden , you find yourself playing in a game against competitors who have a tremendous potential advantage , playing by new and unknown rules .
Until things get sorted out , any intermediary that wants to survive , which includes every corporation in America , has to be searching for an angle to get under the government - insured tent .
Once again , I am rushing ahead to real - world analysis , when the real world is much more complicated than my simple model .
I think that the key to making sensible policy recommendations is understanding how the complex financial system emerged .
Only then will one be able to make sensible guesses about the consequences of policy actions .
Right now , as Lawrence H. White puts it , the popular belief is as follows :
1 : Banking and financial markets are inherently unstable .
2 : Government intervention into banking and financial markets can only stabilize ( never destabilize ) .
This is what people want to believe .
My guess is that economists who cater to that belief will have credibility .
Those who doubt that belief will not .
Just as those who describe the current crisis is a villains / victims / heroes story have credibility .
Someone like myself , who looks at securitization as a phenomenon that emerged from arbitrary capital requirements , is not going to be heard .
There is no market for my beliefs ( readers of this blog excepted , of course ) .
The US Defense Advanced Researh Projects Agency - aka DARPA aka The Guys Who Run Area 51 and Have a Pact with the Aliens to Abduct the Entire Human Race in 2012 - has turned its eyes to coal for airplane fuel .
There 's only one problem : coal - to - liquid fuel technologies are too expensive and produce too much pollution .
Until now .
DARPA is now aiming for a $ 1.5 billion plant that will make 100,000 barrels of fuel per day , while producing zero CO2 emissions and using only 0.5 kilograms of water per kilogram of coal converted - I 'm clueless about this , but it seems like an awful lot of water to me , specially compared to the alternative of not flying the airplanes so much .
The cost for each gallon of JP - 8 jet fuel would be $ 3 .
Together with extensive tests on alternative synthetic fuel mixes , the US military wants to make its air machinery as green and cost - effective as possible , since petroleum - based fuels are becoming too expensive .
Coal reserves in the US , however , can fix this .

If you have a no guarantor loan , they will contact you to see why the payment has n’t been made .
If you foresee a problem with making a payment , you should always contact your direct lender at your earliest convenience .
This shows them your intentions are good , and you do want to make your payments .
Contacting the lender will often allow you to avoid this situation , as you can resolve any issues together .
It also demonstrates that you ’re being honest , responsible , and have a genuine desire to pay .
Some people will want a no guarantor loan because they ’re afraid a loan company will contact a guarantor if they miss a payment .
Most lenders will usually only contact a guarantor as a last resort .
They will nearly always try to contact you first , so if you do n’t ignore them , they should n’t need to contact the guarantor .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) --
As the White House and Congress hammer out the details of a rescue plan for embattled financial institutions , Americans worry that it may reward bad behavior but they also fear that doing nothing may hurt the economy , according to a poll released Tuesday .
In a CNN / Opinion Research poll , 79 % of 1,020 respondents said they were worried that the economy could get worse if the government takes no action .
However , 77 % also said they believed that a government bail - out would benefit those responsible for the economic downturn in the first place .
The poll was taken on Sept. 19 - 21 and had a margin of error of plus or minus 3 percentage points .
The Bush administration , under the guidance of Treasury Secretary Henry Paulson , has proposed that the federal government buy up approximately $ 700 billion in problematic assets from financial institutions in order to give them the liquidity they need to stay afloat .
Democratic lawmakers have pushed for a number of additions to the bill , including additional oversight , protections for homeowners and caps on executive compensation .
According to the CNN poll , fully half of respondents said there is too little regulation of the stock market and financial institutions .
The two presidential candidates , Democrat Barack Obama and Republican John McCain have also said there needs to be more government oversight of the bailout plan .
Through it all , Americans remain optimistic .
While a great majority said they believed the economy was struggling , according to the poll , more than two - thirds said they thought the economy would be in good shape a year from now .
You 're John McCain , who put yourself up for sale from the first moment you were elected to Congress .
You were sent there to represent Arizona , but you had larger plans and they included only yourself .
Inside , in the place where a man keeps the trophies of his life , you can reflect on the days you were held as a prisoner of war .
Those were hard times , and you behaved with honor .
But you are not the first war hero to turn venal and selfish .
Something inside you changed once those klieg lights hit your eyes as you walked off the airplane .
Those lights transformed you into a celebrity .
You began to look out only for No. 1 .
Info John McCain
Before becoming the center of attention , you were regarded as an arrogant Navy brat who finished at the bottom of your Annapolis class .
They laughed when you tried to throw your weight around .
All you had was arrogance and a quick temper .
Your sudden status as a war hero got you a coveted assignment as the Navy 's liaison to the U.S. Senate .
You met Senator John Tower of Texas .
You became his student .
Tower was a notorious boozer and wencher .
He spent his most creative hours in a Washington , D.C. , watering hole called the Monocle , where he regularly chased after women 30 years younger than himself .
Tower was your mentor .
He taught you that the road to success and gold in Washington was paved for members of Congress by lobbyists for the political action committees .
Tower advised you to take up residence in Tempe , so you could run for the seat in Congress then about to be vacated by John Rhodes .
Moving to Arizona was a financial bonanza for you , too .
It made it possible for you to marry again .
This time you married an heiress .
Your new wife 's father was Jim Hensley , who owned a beer - distributing company that had a monopoly on peddling Budweiser .
This single act of matrimony transformed you overnight into one of the many millionaire members of Congress .
It changed you forever .
Millionaires think differently about money than people mired in middle incomes .
Millionaires think about preserving their advantage for themselves and their class .
You suddenly became concerned about whether poor people had a work ethic .
You worried if they were willing to pull themselves up by their own bootstraps .
You 're John McCain , who wonders why men carrying signs saying they will work for food are n't energetic enough to marry a beer baron 's daughter .
There are things about yourself that remain imponderable , things that even you can't answer .
How could you stand up to your captors in Vietnam and yet cave in at once when Charlie Keating smothered you in a blizzard of campaign money ?
You have now served in Congress as a faithful lackey of political action committees for ten years -- four in the House of Representatives and six in the United States Senate .
You look down your nose at Claire Sargent , who is running against you as a Democrat .
To you she is laughable , because she does n't even try to raise contributions from PACs .
You do n't realize she has more class and sensitivity in her little finger than you could put together in your entire stock portfolio .
In a radio debate the other day with Sargent and Evan Mecham , you treated them both with contempt .
You made it clear that you do n't think they matter .
Over and over , you said , " The people do n't care " when they tried to make your connection to Keating an issue .
You made it clear that the only issue you cared about was getting back to Washington for another six years .
To you the disgrace of your role in the savings - and - loan matter is forgotten .
You are the only one who has forgotten .
You are the only one who keeps trying to duck it by heading back to Vietnam , where you were once a hero .
" The people want to forget , " you say .
But even you do n't believe it .
You hope desperately to make it back to the Senate on a wave of expensive television advertising paid for by your political action committees .
You raised $ 1.9 million , a sum that makes voters roll their eyes in wonderment .
If your political advertising reflected where it came from , you would be forced to run footage of yourself dining with defense contractors .
You would walk on beaches with Keating and lobbyists for the big pharmaceutical companies .
You would ride horseback with medical lobbyists .
You would walk through developments with the real estate flacks .
There would be one grand shot of you and your family at poolside in Keating 's place in the Bahamas , or disembarking from a free ride on Keating 's jet airplane .
Sometimes , when alone , you must think it strange that after ten years in Congress , the biggest part of your television campaign must still be devoted to those old film clips of you coming back from Vietnam the first time .
You 're John McCain , the hero who sold out .
During the past few days I 've been repeatedly asked the same question :
Is there anything that users of IE , Chrome and other browsers ( who cannot use NoScript ) can do to protect themselves from clickjacking ?
If you read my previous post about it , you already know that currently the only way to protect yourself is disabling JavaScript , plugins / ActiveX and IFRAMEs .
NoScript is the most elegant and usable solution to do it for browsers based on Mozilla technology ( like Firefox ) , because it gives you a quick one - click way to enable the missing technologies on sites you trust and remembers your choices in a whitelist , becoming almost unnoticeable after some " training " about your surfing habits .
Unfortunately , this is not as easy , bearable or even feasible if you use a browser not supported by NoScript ( other than Linx or Elinks ) .
Let 's see what you can do with IE , Safari , Chrome and Opera :
Internet Explorer Open Internet Options |Security , select the " Internet " zone and set the " Security level for this zone " control to " High " .
Bad news : there 's no apparent way to disable IFRAMEs in IE : you can just disable " Launching programs and files in IFRAME " , which is definitely not enough to prevent clickjacking .
Furthermore , while Microsoft's " Internet Zones " can allow individual sites for scripting or active content , their usability is extremely poor if compared to NoScript , requiring several clicks and typing to build a whitelist .
So , to recap : MSIE can't be secured 100 % against clickjacking , and the protection you can get comes with a big usability cost .
Safari Apple 's browser has a central place to disable active content in its Preferences |Security tab .
Bad news here are two : there 's no mean to enable features selectively ( per site ) , and IFRAMEs cannot be disabled in any apparent way ( Mac users , please let me know if I 'm missing something 1 ) .
Therefore Safari can't be secured 100 % against clickjacking , and the protection you can get comes with an enormous usability cost .
Chrome
If you 're a Chrome user , you 're really out of luck : the only apparent way to disable active content is starting the browser with the following command line : chrome.exe - disable - javascript - disable - java - disable - plugins
Of course , you cannot enable back any of these features until you restart your browser with different command line arguments .
Even worse , there 's no " - disable - iframe " option .
So Chrome can't be secured 100 % against clickjacking , and the protection you can get comes with the worst usability cost .
Opera Opera has the best built - in security user interface among browsers , very similar to NoScript 's concepts : you can set restrictive defaults if you want , and relax some restrictions on selected sites you trust , using Site Preferences and Quick Preferences .
It 's just slightly less usable than NoScript , and it can be configured to prevent clickjacking : you need to disable everything you can see in Preferences| Advanced |Content , then enter opera : config in your address bar , click the " Extensions " handle and uncheck the " IFrames " line .
Final note : current NoScript development versions ( 1.8.1.7 and above ) provide protection against IFRAME - based clickjacking even without disabling IFRAMEs .
This is a further usability / security advantage over any other solution , and it 's being tested by Sirdarckcat ( a pioneer of malicious CSS overlays ) with a final stable released planned for the end of this week .
Therefore , if you can choose , your best usability + security choice is still Firefox + NoScript .

The demonstrations , on a steamy first day of the Republican National Convention , began with block after block of marchers -- far fewer than the 50,000 some had predicted -- chanting and peacefully waving signs on downtown St. Paul 's narrow streets .
As the day wore on , the carnival atmosphere turned ugly .
Before most of the demonstrators had finished their march , a few hundred protesters splintered off and became confrontational and sometimes violent .
Some smashed windows at Macy 's and a downtown bank building .
Others challenged police by blocking roads .
Late Monday , authorities said 130 of the 284 people arrested may face felony charges .
Dozens were pepper - sprayed and tear - gassed .
One police officer was punched in the back , and another suffered from heat exhaustion .
St. Paul emergency rooms reported nine minor injuries and several heat - related cases .
Hundreds of police officers , sweltering in heavy riot gear , swept in to block streets and protect delegate buses .
About 3 p.m. , St. Paul police requested help from 150 National Guard troops .
St. Paul Mayor Chris Coleman said officers showed restraint as a small number of law - breaking demonstrators marred an otherwise peaceful day of free speech .
" Their efforts were nothing short of heroic , " Coleman said .
" They did not fail .
They did not take the bait . "
But observers from the National Lawyers Guild took issue with police action .
" We think it 's unconscionable .
We think it 's out of control , " said Gina Berglund , an attorney and legal observer coordinator for the guild 's Minnesota chapter .
" The response by the police was completely out of proportion with what they were faced with . "
St. Paul Police Chief John Harrington said the troublemakers came from a half - dozen loosely organized groups totaling up to 180 people , a small fraction of Monday 's turnout .
Some delegates attacked Members of the Connecticut and Alabama delegations reported being attacked at one point by protesters .
Connecticut delegate Rob Simmons told KMSP - TV that protesters tried to rip the credentials off delegates ' necks and sprayed them with a toxic substance that burned their eyes .
One 80 - year - old delegate was treated for injuries , and several others had to rinse their eyes and clothing .
Also , retired Alabama Supreme Court Judge Terry Butts said about 100 protesters approached a delegation bus and one threw a brick through a window .
Butts said the bus driver suffered cuts .
A cross-section of dissent Protesters had come from across the state and the country for what was expected to be the week 's largest demonstration .
They marched after a noon rally at the State Capitol , snaking down a route that circled in front of the Xcel Energy Center as delegates arrived for a session cut short by Hurricane Gustav .
Cu Nyugen , a Vietnamese native who lives in Minneapolis , brought his 12 - year - old daughter , Mai , on the eve of her first day of sixth grade .
" It 's important for the younger generation to see and learn about different points of view , " Nyugen said .
Marie Williams , 77 , of Minneapolis , carried a " Dissent Is Patriotic " placard .
" I started coming to protests with Paul Wellstone , " she said .
Some were disappointed by the turnout , wondering if the 90 - degree heat , aggressive police and President Bush 's cancellation thinned the crowd .
" I 'm disappointed -- this is far too few people , " said Lennie Major , a teacher from Mounds View .
" We needed 10 times this many to make an impact ; this will only be a blip . "
Escalating violence Harrington said the first illegal salvo happened about 11 a.m. , when a Dumpster was shoved into an occupied squad car on W. 7th Street .
" I 'm not sure how anyone can say that 's protest , " Harrington said .
The peaceful mood started to change after 1:30 p.m. , when several groups broke off and began resisting police .
The biggest showdown occurred about 5:30 p.m. , when police in riot gear cornered about 80 protesters near the Mississippi River below the Minnesota Science Museum .
Daniel Streltz , a freelance photographer , said the protesters sat down when police ordered them to disperse .
By early evening , police had arrested most of them .
About 3 p.m. , about 250 people locked arms to block delegate buses near Robert Street and Kellogg Boulevard .
They were in a standoff with 100 police officers , and authorities warned them to disperse .
Minutes later , when the group refused to move , officers tossed in a dozen tear - gas canisters , prompting the crowd to retreat .
Some demonstrators then attempted to line the street with obstacles .
Witnesses said police also used concussion grenades and smoke bombs .
" Most of [ the demonstrators ] were pretty good , " said CarolLee Folsom , a bystander who used to work for the Ramsey County Sheriff 's Office .
" But you do n't know what any of these people are going to do .
And they warned them , so anybody that wanted to get out could have gotten out . "
Demonstrator Andrew Sigmundik , 18 , disagreed , saying that the police went overboard and that he witnessed " one guy in a wheelchair getting Maced and some other people getting hit by police batons .
" Nobody was trying to cause destruction or violence , " he said .
" The idea was to just block the streets .
We were just trying to disrupt the delegation , and I think we succeeded . "
At about 2 p.m. , protesters dropped bent nails into the intersection at 6th and Wacouta Streets .
A group of more than 200 tossed garbage cans and newspaper kiosks into the road .
A few marchers broke off and threw objects , shattering three windows in a bank building at 4th and Minnesota Streets .
Others continued up 6th , pursued by more than a dozen slow - moving police cars .
A few officers walked in front of the cars , clearing the barriers the marchers had thrown in the street .
By the time they reached 6th and Cedar , many of the marchers began to disperse .
Some smashed three windows at Macy's .
One person jumped up and down a few times on the roof of a parked police car before breaking its windows .
Rally attendee calls to ' kill '
Obama RAW STORY
Published : Tuesday October 14 , 2008
Print This Email This Incendiary slams on Senator Obama at McCain / Palin events continue , as evidenced in Scranton , Pennsylvania Tuesday .
As the Times - Tribune reported , after the " Straight Talk Express " deposited Alaska Gov. Palin at the Riverfront Sports Complex to speak to a crowd of about 4,500 , one audience member shouted " Kill him ! " amid audience booing as GOP congressional candidate Chris Hackett mentioned Obama .
Other epithets hurled against Obama at such events include " treason , " " Arab " and " traitor . "
Senator McCain himself has addressed the incitements , fueled in part by campaign ads accusing Senator Obama of having terrorist ties , by calling Obama a " decent family man " whom one need not fear in the White House .
LONDON , England ( CNN ) --
Work stations with a built - in treadmill and portable meeting rooms are just some of the developments that may become commonplace in the offices of the future .
Offices of the future may include more informal team areas , like this one designed by Perkins +
Will .

Workplace technology has changed dramatically in recent years and the offices we work in are finally set to catch up .
The advent of laptops , wi-fi and BlackBerries means that high - tech workers are no longer tethered to their desks , and the office of the future will be designed to let workers roam .
Dutch designer Michiel van der Kley has come up with Globus , a stylish spherical " podule " that looks like a piece of art , but is actually a mobile work station .
Open it up , take a seat , switch on your laptop and you 're good to go .
If you need to see a colleague you can take your laptop with you and talk shop at a ScooterDesk , an ultra - mobile mini work station by Belgian design firm Utilia .
See what the offices of tomorrow will look like »
Another Belgian company , Living Tomorrow , predicts that as we become increasingly able to work from home , workplaces will spend more time unoccupied .
It says flexibility will be the key to filling unused space , which means that as well as mobile work stations , we 'll be seeing mobile meeting rooms .
The Center for Building Performance and Diagnostics ( CBPD ) at Carnegie Mellon University in Pittsburgh has built the Robert L. Preger Intelligent Workplace -- a functioning workplace that is also a ' living laboratory ' for researching office design .
In an effort to increase energy efficiency , much of the heat in the Intelligent Workplace comes from solar thermal energy and recaptured heat from generators .
Daylight sensors and occupancy sensors mean lighting is n't used when it 's not needed , but workers are also given a huge amount of control over their own environment , regulating air temperature and flow , and lighting levels and direction , from their own work station .
The point of all this , says the CBPD , is to show you can improve quality of life in the workplace while reducing greenhouse gas emissions .
As businesses are coming to realize that the best ideas are often generated in casual conversation , designers such as Perkins and Will are incorporating informal team areas into office environments , to encourage chance encounters and impromptu meetings .
Obesity has become a hot topic as we lead increasingly sedentary lives .
One solution , envisaged by Dr James Levine of the Mayo Clinic in Minneapolis , is for us to burn more calories at work .
With that in mind , his team has developed a treadmill desk that lets you walk while you work , and it has already been tested in real workplaces .
So you 'll soon be able to work off that lunch - time blowout while you work on your big presentation .

The private company Space X will try once again to get a Falcon 1 rocket into orbit .
This fourth launch attempt could be as early as September 28 !
They just had a " static firing " a test of the engines with the rocket strapped down .
Everything looked pretty good , but they detected a minor fault in the second stage liquid oxygen supply .
They 'll be replacing a component in that system just to be safe .
The static firing engine test for the Falcon 1 .
How do we know ?
Well , the economy outside the financial sector is healthier than it seems .
One important indicator is the profitability of non-financial capital , what economists call the marginal product of capital .
It ’s a measure of how much profit that each dollar of capital invested in the economy is producing during , say , a year .
Some investments earn more than others , of course , but the marginal product of capital is a composite of all of them  a macroeconomic version of the price - to - earnings ratio followed in the financial markets .
When the profit per dollar of capital invested in the economy is higher than average , future rates of economic growth also tend to be above average .
The same cannot be said about rates of return on the S.& P. 500 , or any another measurement that commands attention on Wall Street .
Since World War II , the marginal product of capital , after taxes , has averaged 7 percent to 8 percent per year .
( In other words , each dollar of capital invested in the economy earns , on average , 7 cents to 8 cents annually . )
And what happened during 2007 and the first half of 2008 , when the financial markets were already spooked by oil price spikes and housing price crashes ?
The marginal product was more than 10 percent per year , far above the historical average .
The third - quarter earnings reports from some companies already suggest that America ’s non-financial companies are still making plenty of money .
The marginal product has accurately reflected hard economic times in the past .
From 1930 to 1933 , for instance , the marginal product of capital averaged 0.5 percentage points per year less than the postwar average .
The profit per dollar of capital was also below average in the year before the 1982 recession and the year before the 2001 recession .
Sure , the financial industry has taken a hit , and so have cities like New York that depend on that industry .
But the financial system is more resilient today than it has been in the past , because it ’s a much easier industry for companies to enter than it was in the 1930s .
When banks failed during the Great Depression , there were not so many foreign investors that were cash - rich ( or these days , oil - rich ) and appreciative of how some of the bank assets , personnel and brand names in the United States could be used to earn profits in the future .
And do n’t worry about foreign ownership : Americans would benefit if foreigners brought money into our economy to enable banks to continue to lend .
And if it takes a while for banks and lenders to get up and running again , what ’s the big deal ?
Saving and investment are themselves not essential to the economy in the short term .
Businesses could postpone their investments for a few quarters with a fairly small effect on Americans ’ living standards .
How harmful would it be to wait nine more months for a new car or an addition to your house ?
We can largely make up for this delay by extra investment when the banking sector reorganizes itself .
Americans waited years during World War II to begin private - sector investment projects ( when wartime production displaced private investment ) , and quickly brought the capital stock ( housing and big - ticket consumer items ) back to normal levels when the war ended .
So , if you are not employed by the financial industry ( 94 percent of you are not ) , do n’t worry .
The current unemployment rate of 6.1 percent is not alarming , and we should reconsider whether it is worth it to spend $ 700 billion to bring it down to 5.9 percent .
US Tax Payer to Bail Out Bankers From Default - The Mother of All Rip- offs
Low interest credit and “ financial innovation ” are a deadly - combo .
They 've knocked the banking system for a loop , clogged the credit markets with billions of dollars of subprime sludge , and left the real estate market sprawling on the canvas .
Still --- even though $ 2 trillion of capitalization has been wiped - out from falling home prices ; and even though the financial system is in a terminal state of paralysis --- no one has been held accountable .
In fact , not one trader , mortgage lender , rating 's - agency official , fund manager , or investment banker has been indicted or charged with criminal wrongdoing .
NOT ONE - The system operates without rules or guard rails .
It 's the Wild West !
The system is so thoroughly marinated in corruption , that every trace of regulatory - oversight has been removed .
The SEC is little more than a public relations sham loaded with business - friendly sycophants who try to sustain the publics confidence while kow - towing to their corporate paymasters .
It 's a complete hoax .
Last week , the Chairman of the SEC , Christopher Cox , gave a speech at the Ronald Reagan Building .
He said : " We 've already launched an initiative in this area to investigate possible fraud or breaches of fiduciary duty involving collateralized debt obligations .
Among the issues confronting us this year will be determining whether bank holding companies and securities firms made proper disclosure in their filings and public statements of what they knew about their CDO portfolios and their valuations .
We 'll determine whether brokers carefully followed suitability requirements when they sold complex debt - related derivatives that shortly afterward went bad .
And in this area , as elsewhere , we 'll be investigating whether unscrupulous insiders used non-public information to bail out of these securities or to sell them short , in violation of the securities laws . ”
Huh ?
So , after 6 years of sitting on the sidelines watching the fat - cat investment banks and hedge funds sell dodgy securities , ( comprised of mortgages from unemployed thrift - store workers with bad credit )
Cox has finally decided to “ to investigate possible fraud or breaches of fiduciary duty . ”
What a joke .
Trillions of dollars have been lost , the financial system is reeling , and the nation is headed into recession .
We want scalps --- not excuses !
Did Cox know that the CDOs , the MBSs , the ABCP and the rest of the alphabet soup of “ structured investments ” were unalloyed garbage ?
Yes , of course , he did .
Everyone knew .
But they were making so much money selling snake oil to credulous investors they could n't help themselves .
They went ape .
Two week 's ago TV investment guru , Jim Cramer , even admitted that he and his business buddies used to call the investors who bought these sketchy “ debt pools ” “ morons ” and Bozos ” .
That says it all , does n't it ?
Does
Cox expect us to believe that he and his Keystone Cops at the SEC did n't know what was going on ?
Bullshoes !
Here 's a video clip from the Daily Show with Jon Stewart with CNN 's personal finance editor , Gerri Willis .
Willis explains in simple terms how the subprime fiasco evolved .
She acknowledges that the loans were made to “ people who really could n't afford to pay them off ” and that when “ Wall Street saw how successful they were , they decided to sell them as investments all around the world ” .
Good thinking , eh ?
She even admits that the sellers knew that the investments were rotten but duped their customers by saying “ Trust us ” .
Unfortunately , the naive investors found out later that “ they were sold swampland in Texas ” .

This is a great summary of a how millions of investors were ripped off in broad daylight by crafty junk - bond salesmen while the SEC looked the other way .
It may turn out to be the biggest heist of the century .
Trillions of dollars were raked in on complex investments that ( apparently ) everyone in the industry knew were worthless .
This is fraud on an industrial - scale .
And that 's just the beginning .
The same gaggle of investment sharpies who cooked up the subprime swindle are putting the final touches on a plan to off - load hundreds of billions of dollars of mortgage - backed slop onto the American taxpayer .
If they succeed , the country 's biggest GSE 's --- Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac --- will be crushed by the expanded debt - load and probably go belly - up within the year .
Do n't believe me ?
Bush 's new “ Stimulus Package will allow Fannie and Freddie to raise their loan limits from $ 417,000 to $ 729,750 .
The idea is to keep interest rates as low as possible on new mortgages in order to revive the moribund California and New York housing markets .
Jumbo loans — mortgages that are over $ 417 , 000 — - are nearly impossible to get now that the market for mortgage - backed securities ( MBS ) has dried up and the banks have tightened up their lending standards .
Sales in California have dropped 40 % or more for the last 4 months .
Price declines are in double digits .
It is a housing Depression .
Still , there 's no guarantee that the plan will work .
After all , Fannie Mae requires a substantial down payment as well as documentation of earnings and a good credit record .
The whole lending environment has changed dramatically in the last year .
It 's gotten a lot tougher and the pool of potential loan applicants has shrunk considerably .
Besides , how many people are going to plunk down $ 700,000 for a home in a falling market ?
That same MacMansion might dip to $ 625,000 by the end of the year .
No one wants to take a bath like that .
More importantly , why should taxpayers have to guarantee a $ 700,000 loan just so some brandy - swindling tycoon can get a better deal on his mortgage ?
That 's nuts .
Here 's how Sean Olender sums it up in an article in the SF Gate : “ Thanks to Congress , junk bond investors will be able to pawn off their bad debt to Fannie and Freddie , instead of suing the big investment houses for ripping them off .
This shift will certainly doom Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac , so do n't be surprised if we , the taxpayers , have to bail out poor Fannie and Freddie - to the tune of more than $ 1 trillion ....
Why more than $ 1 trillion ?
If Goldman Sachs is correct in its recent projections that home prices in California are going to drop 35 to 40 percent , the state 's losses alone would top $ 2 trillion , because California has a disproportionate number of jumbo loans . ” ( ” Stimulus Plan a Scam to Benefit the Rich ” , Sean Olender )
Olender 's right .
It 'll cost at least a trillion bucks ; and for what ?
To lend a hand to the bond - hucksters who misrepresented themselves so they could pay off their vineyard in Provence ?
No way .
This is all backwards .
It was the investment bankers who created this mess with their mortgage - laundering ” operation .
They 're the one 's who should be cleaning it up .
They do n't need a bail out ; they need to go to jail .
Besides , as Olender points out , Fannie is already in financial trouble and does n't need more debt .
“ Contrary to popular myth , ” says Olender , “ Fannie holds a lot of subprime debt , option ARM debt and other dodgy securities .
Fannie and Freddie owned or guaranteed almost 45 % of all mortgages in America last year .
BusinessWeek noted in 2007 that Fannie and Freddie have " moved more prominently into low - documentation loans , which require little or no proof of the borrower 's income . "
Presently , Fannie has nearly $ 3 trillion mortgages guaranteed , but only $ 34 billion in capital reserves .
If housing prices slide even 10 % ; Fannie 's is under - water and will probably have to file for bankruptcy .
So , why take the chance ?
This week , CNNMoney.com reported : " The increased share of housing debt taken on by Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae during the housing slump has put the two government sponsored enterprises at risk . ”
By “ buying up mortages on the secondary market that the banks are walking away from ” Fannie and Freddie “ are reducing risks in the market , but concentrating mortgage risks on themselves .
These risks are beginning to take their toll , " said James Lockhart , director of the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight ( OFHEO )
He spoke Thursday at a Senate Banking committee on regulatory reform .
Get the picture ?
If Fannie and Freddie take a swan dive the effects will be felt through the entire financial system for years to come .
Naturally , the National Association of Realtors ( NAR ) are jazzed about increasing the conforming loan limits to $ 729,000 .
They 're even predicting that it will boost sales by 300,000 homes .
But that 's just more realator - hype .
Look : the way we got into this mess was by " artificially stimulating " the market with low interest credit from the Fed .
We 're not going to get out of it by using the same strategy .
The government needs to stop meddling in the markets and let home prices return to the mean .
Then the buyers will reappear .
The stimulus will only prolong an already - painful contraction .
Of course , Congress has already rubber - stamped the “ stimulus travesty ” and rushed off to the Senate where it will get a slight face - lift before it 's plopped on Bush 's desk .
Next week , there 'll be a signing ceremony in the Rose Garden , where Bush will be surrounded by a small army of smiling bankers , nodding approvingly and patting themselves on the back for sticking it to the American taxpayer one more time .
What a triumph .
THE BANKER'S MASTERPLAN : " Dump the mortgage - backed junk on Uncle Sam "
Everyone should be aware of the massive fraud that is about to be perpetrated on the nation to save a few shifty bankers from default .
The basic contours of the plan was laid out in an op -ed in the New York Times last week by Howard P. Milstein , chairman of New York Private Bank and Trust .
Milstein made his pitch for a bailout in an article titled “ Give The Banks Some Credit ” .
Milstein says : “ The health of the American — and indeed the global — economy depends on having a financial system that is able to extend credit to businesses and consumers .
The losses that have been incurred as a result of the excesses in subprime mortgage lending will take years to work their way through the worldwide financial system , as dozens of banks act to replenish their lost capital ...
Until the banks rebuild their capital , they will not have the wherewithal to lend money and support economic growth .
If banks of all sizes could regain their capital immediately and easily , it would be a tremendous benefit to the American economy . "
Milstein continues : " The federal government could make this happen by entering into an arrangement with American banks that hold subprime mortgages , in which homeowners typically pay a low interest rate for two or three years then face much higher payments .
Here 's how it would work :
The government would guarantee the principal of the mortgages for 15 years .
And in exchange the banks would agree to leave their “ teaser ” interest rates on those loans in effect for the entire 15 years .
This would instantly give the lending banks new capital . ”
Wait a minute .
If “ the government guarantees the principal of the mortgages ” then there 's no risk for the banks .
If that 's the case then why should they be paid anything , even the “ teaser rates ” .
Investment is risk and risk is investment --- Get used to it .
What Comrade Milstein is requesting is “ nationalizing ” the banking system to protect his indolent friends from loss or default .
This could have been written by Chairman Mao .
Milstein continues : “ As these mortgages would be guaranteed by the Treasury , they would suddenly be assessed , on bank balance sheets , at their original value — and a significant amount of the banks ' lost capital would be restored .
Plus , the banks would receive , from most of the homeowners with subprime mortgages , up to 15 years of teaser - rate payments . ”
Unbelievable !
So the bank takes NO risk on the investment but --- at the same time --- is allowed to add the full value of the mortgage to its capital reserves ?
And , Milstein does n't even want to reduce the value of the mortgage to current housing prices .
He thinks it should be recorded at its " original value " so it can beef up the bank 's dwindling capital .
What kind of rubbish is that ?
Real estate prices have plummeted in the last year and ( and so have subprime " structured investments " ) the banks assets should reflect those losses .
Tough luck , Milstein .
Your buddies cooked up this scam .
Now take your lumps like a man .
Milstein continues : “ By solving the bank capital crisis immediately , this strategy would ensure that fewer families would lose their homes ” ... blah , blah , blah .
It would “ be good for our economy . ”
Blah , blah , blah .
Then Milstein adds this tidbit : " Under this arrangement , American banks would have an incentive to buy back the subprime debt now being held by foreign banks and other financial institutions .
American banks could buy the securities at a discount to face value ( reflecting the continued low teaser rates ) and then , thanks to the government guarantee , hold them as capital assessed at their full value .
That , in turn , would allow the other financial institutions to reinvest in other sectors of our economy . ”
Ah-ha !
So the foreign banks and investors are finally waking up to the fact that they were ripped - off and they want their money back .
It 's about time .
They were defrauded and they deserve restitution .
The first article about the impending tidal wave of subprime litigation appeared earlier in the week on FOX Business.com " Lawsuits Begin to Spill Out of Subprime Mess " http://www.foxbusiness.com/article/lawsuits-begin-spill-subprime-mess_460851_55.html
The subprime boondoggle will play out in courts for years to come .
But , back to Milstein .
What does he want ?
He wants to buy back the subprime debt that was sold to gullible foreign banks " at a discount " but then record it on the banks ' balance sheets at full value .
Whoa .
Now , there 's a neat trick .
In other words , he wants to pay a nickel for the " debt " , but then record it as a dollar to meet his capital requirements .
Is this really how bankers think ?
Oh --- and by the way --- he also wants the American taxpayer to guarantee the debt in case the nickel loses some of its value .
Nice touch , eh? Milstein adheres to the old adage , " Privatize the profits , socialize the losses . "
Finally , Milstein adds that his only interest is his “ concern for the health of the global financial system . ”
Can you feel the love ?
The tragedy of the stimulus charade is that some variation of Milstein 's proposal is sure to be enacted .
Otherwise it would n't have shown up in the NY Times .
The Times frequently uses the op - ed page to put up trial balloons for changes in policy .
It 's the same here .
The banking establishment and the administration have finally settled on a ' bail out plan ' and " We the People " are going to foot the bill .
Congress is already on board and Bush is just a swipe - of - the - pen away from another trillion dollar giveaway to big business .
The banks and money - lenders always get their pound of flesh while the rest of us get screwed .
Some things never change .
Expect Fannie and Freddie to collapse within the year .

Why does n’t Bush go back to Texas and hang himself .
Over 90 % of Americans and over half the world population would have a huge celebration party , and not a tear would be shed .
He is no president of mine , he is no leader , he is nothing but a pathetic little asswipe , and a poor excuse for a man and human being .
Nancy Pelosi is another part of the problem .
She 's a traitor to the people of this country and sleeps in the same bed with the Bush Crime Cartel .
Why do you suppose impeachment is off the table …
The whole kit and caboodle needs to be hung by the neck until dead while being broadcast live on public television throughout America and the free world

28 Feb 08 , 14:45 Wealth Unsurpment to Top 1 %
Finally someone realizes the scheme to usurp wealth from everyday citizens to the top 1 % of the country .
So basically in layman 's terms ; the banks made some bad business decisions and when they screw up we the tax payer bails them out .
Ok now realize that the dollar is backed by nothing but American dominance of oil markets .
( petrodollar )
So these banks get to borrow money at extremely low rates and then inflate the currency 10 times over through fractional reserve banking .
So we have in this country banking institutions that can create money by only having to hold 10 % of reserves on all the money they loan out and still they make bad investments and lose money ?
Seriously are you joking me ?
If i could create 10 times the amount of money I borrow and still mismanage my investments I would think that something is wrong with me and I should not be in the position of such monetary power .
lets look at this from an everyday perspective , I am 26 and have a pretty average credit score , 3 years ago I could have gotten one of these adjustable rate loans and i received plenty of offers .
Fast foreward to today , the only people that qualify for loans are in the top tiers of credit scores which correlate with individual wealth .
So now that property is cheaper and loans are harder t obtain and are at lower interest rates the only people that can buy this property which in economists stock speak are " on sale " I have no chance in hell .
but the rich buy up more of the country while it is on sale while the rest of us struggle to pay for gas and food .
Nice job fed , keep cheerleading for your stock holders who are comprised of many foreign investors so while the rich are taking the country from the poor , the fed is wholesaling the whole economy and currency to it 's true allegiance it 's primary stock holders as in any other corporation .
Banking Reform or welfare state ... you choose .

There Would Have To Be A Revolution ...
Reverse The Genocide And Put The Rich 6 Feet In The Dirt
Nine Iraqi civilians were killed Wednesday in two armed clashes involving U.S. soldiers , local authorities reported .
The military said U.S. soldiers were fired upon first in both incidents .
In the capital , three people were killed in a fiery crash after gunfire erupted as their vehicle passed U.S. soldiers with a convoy stopped near the Baghdad international airport to recover a stalled vehicle .
Officials at Yarmouk Hospital identified the dead as a manager and two female employees from a bank at the airport .
Iraqi police also reported that two bodyguards were injured .
A statement from the U.S. military characterized the three as criminals who opened fire on the military convoy about 9 a.m .
The statement said that the assault left bullet holes in the U.S. vehicles and that a weapon was recovered from the wreckage .

The conflicting information in the two reports could not be immediately reconciled .
In east Baghdad , a roadside bomb killed one American soldier Wednesday , the U.S. military announced today .
At least 4,110 U.S. service members have died since the war began in 2003 , according to icasualties.org .
Earlier Wednesday outside Tikrit , about 80 miles north of Baghdad , six people were killed and three injured in and near a farmhouse that was destroyed in a U.S. airstrike , police said .
A U.S. ground patrol called in the strike after coming under fire .
Police said the farmer , Affar Ahmed Zidan , heard the patrol outside about 2:30 a.m. and fired three warning shots in the air , thinking the soldiers were thieves .

Zidan then phoned police for help while hiding under a tree , saying he feared the Americans would bomb him , police said .
A neighbor , Tariq Azzawi , said Zidan was killed beside the tree and his wife and three children were killed in the house .
The hospital raised the toll to six .
A statement from the U.S. military said the patrol was fired upon and surveillance teams observed an armed man moving into a nearby group of buildings .
The airstrike was ordered when he refused to come out .
The man was killed and four women were slightly injured , but a thorough search did not reveal any other deaths , the statement said .

Civilian deaths at the hands of the U.S. military and private security contractors are a nagging cause of resentment with the Iraqi public and have become a sticking point in negotiations on an agreement to allow U.S. - led forces to remain in Iraq after the United Nations mandate expires at the end of the year .
The Iraqi government is seeking legal jurisdiction in all cases involving injury or death to Iraqis .
U.S. negotiators are willing to allow private security contractors to come under Iraqi law , but not the military .
Elsewhere in Iraq on Wednesday , a Mosul City Council member and his driver were fatally shot in an ambush .
A car bomb went off near an ice cream shop in east Baghdad , killing three and injuring seven , police said .
And two people were killed and four people were injured in Karbala when a bomb detonated in a microbus .
In Washington , Iraqi President Jalal Talabani met with President Bush in the White House .

Talabani ’s office released a statement saying he praised Bush as “ a great friend of the Iraqi people ” and pledged to work toward a security agreement between the two countries .

As the pace of medical innovation slows to a crawl , how do drug companies stay in profit ?
By ‘ discovering ’ new illnesses to fit existing products .
But , says Ben Goldacre , in the second extract from his new book , for many problems the cure will never be found in a pill .

Monday September 1 2008
When you ’ve been working with bullshit for as long as I have , you start to spot recurring themes : quacks and the pharmaceutical industry use the exact same tricks to sell their pills , everybody loves a “ science bit ” – even if it ’s wrong – and when people introduce pseudoscience into any explanation , it ’s usually because there ’s something else they ’re trying desperately not to talk about .
But my favourite is this : alternative therapists , the media , and the drug industry all conspire to sell us reductionist , bio-medical explanations for problems that might more sensibly and constructively be thought of as social , political , or personal .
And this medicalisation of everyday life is n’t done to us ; in fact , we eat it up .
In 2007 the British Medical Journal published a large , well - conducted , randomised controlled trial , performed at lots of different locations , run by publicly funded scientists , that delivered a strikingly positive result : it showed that one treatment could significantly improve children ’s antisocial behaviour .
The treatment was entirely safe , and the study was even accompanied by a very compelling cost - effectiveness analysis .
Did this story get reported as front - page news in the Daily Mail , natural home of miracle cures ( and sinister hidden scares ) ?
Was it followed up on the health pages , with an accompanying photo feature , describing one child ’s miraculous recovery , and an interview with an attractive happy mother with whom we could all identify ?
No .
This story was unanimously ignored by the entire British news media , despite their preoccupation with antisocial behaviour , school performance and miracle cures , for one very simple reason : the research was not about a pill .
It was about a cheap , practical parenting programme .
Meanwhile , for over five years now , newspapers and television stations have tried to persuade us , with “ science ” , that fish - oil pills have been proven to improve children ’s school performance , IQ , behaviour , attention , and more .
As I have documented with almost farcical repetitiveness in this paper , these
so - called “ fish - oil trials ” were so badly designed that they amounted to little more than a sham .
In the case of the biggest , “ the Durham trial ” , the county council has refused even to release the results , which I have every reason to believe were unflattering .
I ’m not desperately interested in whether fish - oil capsules improve children ’s IQ , and I say this for a number of reasons .
Firstly , I ’m not a consumer journalist , or a lifestyle guru , and I am not in the business of handing out “ readers ’ health advice ” .
Also , if you think about it rationally , any beneficial effects of fish oil on school performance will probably not be all that dramatic .
We do not have an epidemic of thick vegetarians , and humans have shown themselves to be as versatile as their diets are diverse , from Alaska to the Sinai desert .
But I would n’t start with molecules , or pills , as a solution to these kinds of problems .
The capsules Durham are promoting cost 80 p per child per day , while it spends only 65 p per child per day on school meals , so you might start there .
Or you might restrict junk - food advertising to children , as the government has recently done .
You might look at education and awareness about food and diet , as Jamie Oliver recently did very well , without recourse to dodgy pseudoscience or miracle pills .
But you might also step away from obsessing over food just for once and look at parenting skills , teacher recruitment and retention , orsocial exclusion , or classroom size , or social inequality and the widening income gap .
Or parenting programmes , as we said right at the beginning .
In fact , Durham ’s GCSE results , where the “ trial ” was performed , improved far more in the year before the fish - oil pills were introduced , after a huge input of extra funding and , more importantly , extra effort from local teachers and the community .
But the media do n’t report stories like that : because “ pill solves complex social problem ” , even if it ’s not true , is a much better angle .
The fish - oil story is by no means unique : repeatedly , in a bid to sell pills , people sell a wider explanatory framework , and as George Orwell first noted , the true genius in advertising is to sell you the solution and the problem .
Pharmaceutical companies with serotonergic antidepressant drugs to sell have worked hard , in their direct - to - consumer advertisements and their lobbying , to push the “ serotonin hypothesis ” for depression – the idea that low serotonin causes low mood – even though the scientific evidence for this theory is growing thinner every year .
Meanwhile the nutrition supplements industry promotes dietary deficiencies as their treatable cause for low mood .
But this fish - oil story is also a classic example of a phenomenon more widely described as “ medicalisation ” , the expansion of the biomedical remit into domains where it may not be helpful or necessary .
In the past , commentators have portrayed this as something that doctors inflict on a passive and unsuspecting world , an expansion of the medical empire ; in reality , it seems that these reductionist biomedical stories can appeal to us all , because complex problems often have depressingly complex causes , and the solutions can be taxing and unsatisfactory .
In its most aggressive form , this process has been characterised as “ disease - mongering ” .
It can be seen throughout the world of quack cures – and being alive to it is like having the scales removed from your eyes – but to understand its relevance to the pharmaceutical industry , we need a quick primer in medical history .
Before 1935 doctors were basically useless .
We had insulin , morphine for pain relief – a drug with superficial charm , at least – and we could do operations fairly cleanly , although with huge doses of anaesthetics , because we had n’t yet sorted out well - targeted muscle - relaxant drugs .
Then suddenly , between the 1930s and the 1970s , science poured out an almost constant stream of miracle cures .
Everything we associate with modern medicine happened in that time : antibiotics , dialysis , transplants , intensive - care units , heart surgery , every drug you ’ve ever heard of , and more .
For people who were ill , the difference was spectacular .
If you got TB in the 1920s you died , pale and emaciated , in the style of a romantic poet .
If you got TB in the 1970s , then in all likelihood you would live to a ripe old age .
You might have to take rifampicin and isoniazid for months on end – they ’re not nice drugs , and the side - effects make your eyeballs and urine turn pink – but if all goes well you will live to see inventions unimaginable in your childhood .
Times have changed .
The pharmaceutical industry is in trouble : the golden age of medicine has creaked to a halt , the low - hanging fruit of medical research has all been harvested , and the industry is rapidly running out of new drugs .
Fifty “ novel molecular entities ” a year were registered in the 1990s , but now it ’s down to 20 , and many of those are just copies of other companies ’ products , changed only enough to justify a new patent .
So the story of “ disease mongering ” goes like this : because they cannot find new treatments for the diseases we already have , the pill companies have instead had to invent new diseases for the treatments they already have .
Recent favourites include social anxiety disorder ( a new use for SSRI antidepressant drugs ) , female sexual dysfunction ( a new use for Viagra in women ) , the widening diagnostic boundaries of “ restless leg syndrome ” , and of course “ night eating syndrome ” ( another attempt to sell SSRI medication , bordering on self - parody ) to name just a few : all problems , in a very real sense , but perhaps not necessarily the stuff of pills , and perhaps not all best viewed in reductionist biomedical terms .
In fact , you might consider that reframing intelligence , loss of libido , shyness and tiredness as medical pill problems is a crass , exploitative , and frankly disempowering act .
Selling us crude biomedical mechanisms may well enhance the placebo benefits from pills , but these stories are also seductive precisely because of what they edit out .
In the media coverage around the rebranding of Viagra as a treatment for women in the early noughties , and the invention of female sexual dysfunction , for example , it was n’t just the tablets that were being sold : it was the explanation .
Glossy magazines told stories about couples with relationship problems who went to their GP , and the GP did n’t understand their problem ( the first paragraph of any medical story in the media ) .
Then they went to the specialist , and he did n’t help either .
But then they went to a private clinic .
Here they did blood tests – hormone profiles , esoteric imaging studies of clitoral bloodflow – and then they understood .
The solution was in a pill , but that was only half the story , and the diagnosis was almost more important : she had a mechanical problem Rarely was there a mention of any other factors , that she was feeling tired from overwork , that he was exhausted from being a new father , or finding it hard to come to terms with the fact that his wife was now the milky mother of his children , and no longer the nubile sex vixen he first snogged on the floor of the student union building to the sound of Do n’t You Want Me? by the Human League in 1983 .
This is because we do n’t want to talk about these issues , any more than we want to talk about social inequality , the disintegration of local communities , the breakdown of the family , the impact of employment uncertainty , changing expectations and notions of personhood , or any of the other complex , difficult factors that play into the apparent rise of antisocial behaviour in schools .
This wishful deafness to the clamour of reality reaches its purest form in our newfound obsession with food , as if it was the most important lifestyle risk factor for ill health , as if every technical detail should be devoured and acted on , for the promise of eternal zest .
From the Daily Mail ’s ongoing project to divide all the inanimate objects in the world into ones that either cause or cure cancer , to daytime television ’s obsession with the healing power of this week ’s magic berry , there is no end to this material .
Should you believe it ?
No .
I have demonstrated time and again how these claims are flawed in their own specific cases .
But something more interesting is being ignored in the background .
The World Health Organisation ’s Commission on the Social Determinants of Health reported this week , and it contained some chilling figures .
Life expectancy in the poorest area of Glasgow – Calton – is 28 years less than in Lenzie , a middle - class area just eight miles away .
That is a lot less life , and it is n’t just because the people in Lenzie are careful to eat goji berries for extra antioxidants , and a handful of brazil nuts every day , thus ensuring they ’re not deficient in selenium , as per nutritionists ’ advice .
People die at different rates because of a complex nexus of interlocking social and political issues including work life , employment status , social stability , family support , housing , smoking , drugs , and possibly diet , although the evidence on that , frankly , is pretty thin , and you certainly would n’t start there .
But we do , because it ’s such a delicious fantasy , because it ’s commodifiable and pushed by expert PR agencies , and in some respects this is one of the most destructive features of the whole nutritionist project , graphically exemplified by figures such as Dr Gillian McKeith PhD .
Food has become a distraction from the real causes of ill health , and also , in some respects , a manifesto of rightwing individualism .
You are what you eat , and people die young because they deserve it .
You hear it from people as they walk past the local council estate and point at a mother feeding her child crisps : “ Well , when you look at what they feed them , ” they say , “ it ’s got to be diet , has n’t it ? ”
They choose death , through ignorance and laziness , but you choose life , fresh fish , olive oil , and that ’s why you ’re healthy .
You ’re going to see 80 .
You deserve it .
Not like them .
Genuine public - health interventions to address the social and lifestyle causes of disease are far less lucrative , and far less of a spectacle , than anything a lifestyle magazine editor or television commissioner would dare to touch .
What prime - time TV show looks at food deserts created by giant supermarket chains , the very companies with which the stellar media nutritionists so often have their lucrative commercial contracts ?
What glossy magazine focuses on how social inequality drives health inequality ?
Where ’s the human interest in prohibiting the promotion of bad foods , facilitating access to healthier foods by means of taxation , or maintaining a clear labelling system ?
There is no glamour in “ enabling environments ” that naturally promote exercise , or urban planning measures that prioritise cyclists , pedestrians and public transport over the car .
There are no votes , it seems , in reducing the ever - increasing inequality between senior executive and shop - floor pay .
When do you ever hear about elegant ideas like “ walking school buses ” ?
Somewhere near you , a softly spoken public - health official has probably tried to interest your local paper in a story on them ; presumably the latest urgent food - fad news left no space .
We love this stuff .
It is n’t done to us , we invite it , and we buy it , because we want to live in a simple universe of rules with justice , easy answers and predictable consequences .
We want pills to solve complex social problems like school performance .
We want berries to stop us from dying and to delineate the difference between us and the lumpen peasants around us .
We want nice simple stories that make sense of the world .nd if you make us think about anything else more complicated , we will open our mouths , let out a bubble or two , and float off – bored and entirely unphased – to huddle at the other end of our shiny little fishbowl eating goji berries .

From ABC :
Alaska Gov. Sarah Palin fought to protest atrocities in Sudan by dropping assets tied to the country ’s brutal regime from the state ’s multi-billion - dollar investment fund , she claimed during Thursday ’s vice presidential debate .
Not quite , according to a review of the public record and according to the recollections of a legislator and others who pushed a measure to divest Alaskan holdings in Sudan - linked investments .
“ The [ Palin ] administration killed our bill , ” said Alaska state representative Les Gara , D - Anchorage .
Gara and state Rep. Bob Lynn , R - Anchorage , co-sponsored a resolution early this year to force the Alaska Permanent Fund a $ 40 billion investment fund , a portion of whose dividends are distributed annually to state residents to divest millions of dollars in holdings tied to the Sudanese government .
In Thursday ’s debate , Palin said she had advocated the state divest from Sudan .
“ When I and others in the legislature found out that we had some millions of dollars [ of Permanent Fund investments ] in Sudan , we called for divestment through legislation of those dollars , ” Palin said .
But a search of news clips and transcripts from the time do not turn up an instance in which Palin mentioned the Sudanese crisis or concerns about Alaska ’s investments tied to the ruling regime .
Moreover , Palin ’s administration openly opposed the bill , and stated its opposition in a public hearing on the measure .
“ The legislation is well - intended , and the desire to make a difference is noble , but mixing moral and political agendas at the expense of our citizens ’ financial security is not a good combination , ” testified Brian Andrews , Palin ’s deputy treasury commissioner , before a hearing on the Gara - Lynn Sudan divestment bill in February .
Minutes from the meeting are posted online by the legislature .
Gara says the lack of support from Palin ’s administration helped kill the measure .
“ I walked out of that hearing livid , ” Gara recalled of the February meeting .
Because of the Palin administration ’s opposition to the bill , “ We could not get a vote in that committee , ” he explained .
At no point did Palin come out in support of the effort , Gara said .
Rat Meat Rises in Popularity as Inflation Hits Locals
Rats …
To many rats are a disgusting creature that we cannot wait to have killed or removed .
However in Cambodia , no rat is left to waste … especially not when inflation has increased the cost of meat almost double in the last year .
Many Cambodians already believed rat meat to be a great source of protein and a tasty little snack when gathered together drinking , but the popularity of the meat really began to increase when beef hit around $ 10 a pound .
At around $ 2.50 a pound , rat meat favorites like the garlic - flavored field rat have quickly replaced the standard beef dishes .
“ Not only are our poor eating it , but there is also demand from Vietnamese living on the border with us . ” said an agricultural official from Koh Thom .
Not only have the locals saved money by eating more rat meat , they have also been able to earn more money by catching rats and making them table - ready .

Sarah 's a hit with the ladies -- white ladies , anyway .
Monday 's Washington Post - ABC
News poll , which showed a newly deadlocked presidential race , registered a 20 - point bump for the McCain ticket among white women since the previous poll , taken before Sarah Palin was loosed on the world .
Among these women , Barack Obama 's eight - point lead has turned into a 12 - point deficit .
No wonder Republicans have been criticizing identity politics all these years .
It works .
And nobody is benefiting from it more than the selfsame GOP .
The Republicans come charging out of their convention bolstered by a hopped - up base , the empathetic support of working - class ( chiefly married ) white women and the mantle , however ludicrous , of change .
There 's not much Obama can do about energized GOP faithful , but there are any number of things he can do to erode voters ' infatuation with Palin , and all manner of things he needs to do yesterday to debunk the Republicans ' claim to the banner of change .
Anyone familiar with polling knows that when voters start liking a candidate , they start giving that candidate higher marks than they previously had on a wide range of issues , even though the candidate 's record and positions on those issues may not have changed at all .
This , along with the symbolism of Palin 's selection , helps explain why voters ' estimation of McCain 's economic policies has risen : Obama 's lead on the question of who can better handle the economy has abruptly shrunk to just five percentage points , and that change has been driven by white women .
Before the conventions , they preferred Obama on the economy by 12 points ; now , they prefer McCain by 10 .
( Other national polls show a similar narrowing of Obama 's advantage on the economy . )
If Obama and his strategists can't reclaim the economic issue after eight years of Republicans presiding over the first recorded recovery in American history that failed to boost family incomes , and now over a slowdown that has its roots in the GOP 's mania for deregulation , they ought to find another line of work .
They need to ask John McCain at every turn :
What Bush economic policies do you repudiate ?
Where have you broken with Bush on the economy ?
After all , McCain is now merrily calling for tax cuts at every campaign stop .
That 's his economic revitalization program .
Not coincidentally , that 's also been George W. Bush 's economic revitalization program for eight years :
Cut taxes chiefly on the rich and their investments will enrich us all .
We all know how well that 's worked .
Obama should have several distinct advantages here .
First , his proposed tax cuts , unlike McCain 's ( which chiefly renew Bush 's giveaway to the wealthiest Americans ) , are directed heavily toward working - and middle - class Americans , including most of the white women who are flirting with the Republicans .
And while McCain attacks Obama 's proposed tax hikes on the rich as job - killers , Obama 's increases are modeled closely on those that Bill Clinton signed into law in 1993 .
Republicans made the same argument then : that Clinton 's tax hikes would cost jobs .
Problem is , the U.S. economy grew by 22 million jobs during Clinton 's presidency .
It has grown by just 5 million during Bush 's presidency , and that number is falling every month as the slowdown deepens .
Since McCain is advocating the same tax policies that Bush enacted , why would anyone expect a different result ?
Second , Obama 's economic policies are keyed , as McCain 's are not , to creating American jobs in a global economy .
The problem with across - the - board tax cuts for corporations and the rich is that with each passing year there 's a higher likelihood that those cuts will be invested by their recipients in jobs in China and India .
Obama , by contrast , proposes eliminating tax cuts for companies that take jobs abroad and establishing tax cuts for companies that create jobs at home .
Obama is also committed to spending $ 150 billion during his term in office for a green - jobs - alternative - energy program that would create millions of non -offshorable jobs .
McCain makes rhetorical bows to helping alternative energy industries , but he 's made no commitment of public dollars to back up his speechifying .
Add his lack of commitment to green jobs to his faith in traditional trickle - down economics , and it becomes clear that McCain has no vision whatever for how to create American jobs in the 21st - century economy .
There are a few other points of economic differentiation between the candidates .
Obama offers plausible plans to make college and health insurance more affordable ; McCain does n't .
Obama opposed a number of proposed trade accords ; McCain supported every trade treaty of the past three decades .
McCain , candidate of economic change ?
Even if Sarah Palin brings a working - mom pedigree to the ticket by schlepping her kids around with her while on state business ( and collecting per diems for it , too ) , all that McCain - Palin promises is four more years of economic dysfunction and decline .

Many of the female saints of the early church behaved in ways that in a different setting would have brought an accusation of witchcraft .
Many had relationships with birds and beasts identical to those that witches were thought to have .
The seventh - century saint Melangell , for example , sheltered a hare beneath her skirts as she knelt praying in a wood and when the following hounds caught up they fell back whining ; later , witches would be thought to inhabit the bodies of hares .

Moreover , Demos is ill equipped to ­explain why it is that the most frightful witch hunts of the 16th and 17th centuries occurred in Protestant Europe , where the authority of the papacy had been rejected and minority sects and millennial cults were springing up everywhere .
He disposes of the most diligent witch hunters in Europe in a few brief synoptic paragraphs that add little to our understanding of why 9 million — or was it 50,000 ? — people were tried as witches between 1550 and 1700 .
It is still a sin for a Catholic to consult a witch or a necromancer , but under Catholicism there was no systematic attempt to drive such practitioners out of the community .
Even on the eve of a great witch hunt the merry wives of Shakespeare ’s Windsor occasionally availed themselves of the services of the Witch of Brentford , who had nothing worse to fear than being beaten out of the house by an angry husband .
In much of the Western world witches and witchcraft are as much a part of the regular business of life as they were in premodern times .
In rural Italy to this day a woman who suspects her husband of infidelity will consult a strega , who will give her a fascino , a charm to stop him from straying .
In 2003 the charismatic life coach Carole Caplin was described as having “ cast a spell ” over the better educated wife of the British prime minister .
In hanging Caplan ’s “ magic crystals ” round her neck Cherie Blair was probably a victim of false science rather than guilty of superstition , but in its early days experimental science too was heresy .
Women ’s magazines now run page after page of advertisements for fortunetellers and other charlatans , who exploit with impunity the gullibility of their readership .
Demos ’s account of the travels of the “ Malleus Maleficarum , ” the “ Hammer of Witches , ” compiled by Heinrich Kramer and Jakob Sprenger and first published in Latin in Strasbourg in 1487 , with many more Latin editions in 40 years , is marred by his own faith in text as authority .
Early printings are a strange selection of texts partly because of the vicissitudes of financing book production ; “ Malleus Maleficarum ” is a pretty good example of a book that every institution had to own , rather than a book everyone wanted to read .
Demos might have been inspired to reconsider if he had known a little more about the “ eccentric Catholic intellectual ” Montague Summers , who revived it in 1928 .
In the last portion of “ The Enemy Within ” Demos includes a series of brief essays on American witch hunts — the various anti-Masonry scares , the persecution of the Bavarian Illuminati , the anarchists following the Haymarket riot , the different Red scares and McCarthyism , and the child sex - abuse panic .
The discussion of all of these is brief and superficial .
Demos keeps asking himself whether these episodes could be correctly described as witch hunts , which of course they can .
The real question is whether what happened in Salem in 1692 is an aspect of the same process .
No witch - finder general orchestrated the events in New England .
Demos includes an overview of contemporary interpretations of “ what happened at Salem ” under 20 headings , an ideal format for undergraduate course notes but hardly suitable for a book .
It was not that long ago that black people in the Deep South could be beaten or killed for seeking the right to vote , talking back to the wrong white man or failing to give way on the sidewalk .
People of color who violated these and other proscriptions could be designated “ uppity niggers ” and subjected to acts of violence and intimidation that were meant to dissuade others from following their examples .
The term “ uppity ” was applied to affluent black people , who sometimes paid a horrific price for owning nicer homes , cars or more successful businesses than whites .
Race - based wealth envy was a common trigger for burnings , lynchings and cataclysmic episodes of violence like the Tulsa race riot of 1921 , in which a white mob nearly eradicated the prosperous black community of Greenwood .
Forms of eloquence and assertiveness that were viewed as laudable among whites were seen as positively mutinous when practiced by people of color .
As such , black men and women who looked white people squarely in the eye — and argued with them about things that mattered — were declared a threat to the racial order and persecuted whenever possible .
This obsession with black subservience was based in nostalgia for slavery .
No sane person would openly express such a sentiment today .
But the discomfort with certain forms of black assertiveness is too deeply rooted in the national psyche — and the national language — to just disappear .
It has been a persistent theme in the public discourse since Barack Obama became a plausible candidate for the presidency .

Mr Ocampo said he could not ignore the alleged war crimes in Darfur The International Criminal Court 's ( ICC ) chief prosecutor has told the BBC he will continue to push for Sudan 's leader to be charged with war crimes .
Luis Moreno Ocampo said there was strong evidence that President Omar al - Bashir was behind attacks on civilians in Darfur province .
The Sudanese government has rejected the allegations , saying the ICC 's case threatens peace efforts in Darfur .
A number of countries want the UN to block the attempt to indict Mr Bashir .
" We found evidence that al - Bashir himself was controlling the attacks on these people who normally live in Darfur , " Mr Ocampo told the BBC's Arabic Service .
He said local people had been raped and killed by both the Sudanese army and Janjaweed pro-government militias .
Mr Ocampo said the attacks were continuing and that he could not ignore the alleged crimes .
He is to put his case before a ICC judges next week .
In July , he asked the judges to issue an arrest warrant for Mr Bashir .
African indictments Opponents of the investigation argue that it is hindering efforts to establish peace in Darfur .
Mr Bashir has denied the allegations against him The African Union and the Arab League have said the investigation should be dropped .
African Union Chairman Jean
Ping told the BBC it was unfair that all those indicted by the ICC so far were African .
" We are not against international justice , " he said .
" It seems that Africa has become a laboratory to test the new international law . "
But some Western countries , such as the US and the UK , say Mr Bashir 's government has backed militias accused of committing widespread atrocities in Darfur .
Up to 300,000 people have been killed and more than two million have been forced from their homes in Darfur since a rebellion began in 2003 .
The International Criminal Court is expected to rule on how to proceed before the end of this year .
It can refuse to prosecute the case if it believes that doing so would be a threat to peace and security .
The African Union has already asked the UN Security Council to put a block on the case .

So you ’ve got yourself an Amazon addiction , shopping for everything from books to mobile phones to toiletries and myriad other odds and ends .
Or maybe you want to shop the retailer , but are no fan of sending credit card information across the Web for phishers to scavenge .
Or maybe you do n’t have plastic on hand .
In any case , you prefer to make your trades IOU - style .
Now you may .
Amazon today has introduced to its many millions of annual customers the option to receive an invoice for goods received to be paid post - shipment .
The megasite has signed a deal with Bill Me Later to reach the check - writing demographic , a group undoubtedly decreasing in size but still adamant in its preference for a more tangible transaction , so to speak .
The public ’s trust in e-commerce may have grown quite a bit in the last decade or so , but holdouts evidently exist .
This is n’t the first we ’ve heard of ties made between Amazon and Bill Me Later .
Late last year , the retailer was reported as having invested in the alternative payment system .
But for many shoppers the news today of the arrival of Bill Me Later as a payment choice on the storefront has likely come not a moment too soon .
Bill Me Later , founded in 2000 , has come to serve consumer needs on some 900 + sites big and small .
It ’s presumably safe to say many expected Amazon to make such a move years ago .
US troops have killed six members of the Iraqi security forces during a patrol on the river Tigris just north of Baghdad , Iraqi police say .
The Americans have given no casualty figures , but have spoken of their regret at the mistake .
The Iraqis say the incident occurred when Iraqi forces fired warning shots into the air as a US boat was passing close to a checkpoint near Tarmiya .
US forces were conducting operations against suspected al - Qaeda militants .
The shootings happened early on Wednesday morning at a joint Iraqi army and police checkpoint .
" The Iraqis fired in the air , but a few minutes later , a helicopter shot at them and killed six of them and wounded 10 others , " an Iraqi security official said AFP news agency .
The US military confirmed the incident took place and that coalition aircraft were involved .
" It is always regrettable when incidents of mistaken fire occur on the battlefield , a review of the circumstances is under way , " the US military said in a statement .
These killings come at a very sensitive time for relations between the US and Iraqi authorities , says the BBC's Mike Sergeant in Baghdad .
Difficult negotiations are continuing to try to secure an agreement on how long US forces should remain in the country , and on what basis they should operate , our correspondent adds .
( Adds details on companies accused of wrongdoing , paragraph 6 )
WASHINGTON , Sept 18 ( Reuters ) - U.S. Interior Secretary Dirk Kempthorne told Congress on Thursday he was “ dismayed ” about the “ inexcusable ” behavior of some department employees who had sex , used drugs and took gifts from workers at regulated oil and gas companies .
Kempthorne testified at a House Natural Resources Committee hearing on the findings by the Interior Department ’s inspector general about “ a culture of substance abuse and promiscuity ” at the department ’s Minerals Management Service ( MMS ) , whose employees handled billions of dollars in oil and natural gas supplies that were turned over by companies as in - kind royalty payments for drilling on federal lands .
“ The abuse of the public trust in this instance is tragic , ” Kempthorne testified .
“ I am outraged that the public ’s trust , an important and necessary part of public service , has been abused . ”
In his findings , Interior Department Inspector General Earl Devaney said about a dozen MMS workers in the royalty - in - kind program took cocaine and marijuana and had “ illicit sexual encounters . ”
Government workers also got drunk at social events with employees of oil companies doing business with the agency and MMS workers had “ brief sexual relationships ” with industry contacts , the inspector general said .
The oil companies named in the report were Chevron CVX.N , Shell Oil RDSa.L and Gary Williams Energy Corp .
Hess Corp HES.N was accused of providing gifts to MMS employees .
While all the companies provided documents , Devaney said Chevron slowed the investigation by hiring counsel for its employees , who then did not make themselves available to be interviewed by the inspector general ’s investigators .
Democratic Rep. Nick Rahall , who heads the House committee , asked whether “ the cronyism between MMS employees and the oil and gas companies ” cost the government lost royalty revenue .
Devaney said “ there probably were some losses ” in royalty money that should have been paid by the companies , but he has no idea how much .
“ Those contract files were in terrible shape ” and could not be audited , he said .
However , Devaney said if the records had been in order there may have been criminal prosecution of some energy company workers .
Devaney said he did not uncover any evidence that energy company workers were directed by their managers to provide gifts to MMS employees .
“ I do n’t think it went too high , ” he said .
Devaney said he was disappointed that the Justice Department decided against prosecuting some MMS employees for their wrongdoing .
“ I would like to see a more aggressive approach , ” he said .
Kempthorne said the MMS has accepted four recommendations the inspector general made to clean up the agency , including enhancing the ethics program for employees and boosting oversight of the agency ’s Denver office where the royalty - in - kind program is run .

While you could say a lot of things about Sarah Palin 's screed of an acceptance speech , it would suffice to simply note that it 's pretty damn rich for John McCain to dispatch a secessionist to criticize any American 's patriotism .
To use Palin 's formulation : when the delegates have retreated to their Hummer dealerships and gated communities , and when the hockey mom platitudes have faded back to Wasilla , Sarah Palin is still a petty , corrupt , pork - barelling , flip - flopping secessionist terrified of anyone inclined to peel back the veneer on her shady recent past .
A Pair Of Dice Which Never Roll 7
by Simon Tatham
Introduction
Some friends of mine play the board game Settlers Of Catan .
In this game , each player rolls two ordinary dice on their turn , and the number which comes up determines what resources people get for the turn .
When a seven is rolled , something special happens : no resources are generated , and instead a robber moves on the board .
After playing this game for a while , my friends felt that although the game would get a bit dull without any sevens , they were rather unhelpful in the initial phase of the game : when everybody is trying to collect lots of resources to get started with , rolling a seven slows everyone down .
So we adopted a " house rule " which said that during the first two full rounds , if anyone rolled a seven , they should immediately re-roll until they got something else .
After a couple of rounds , once the game had got going , sevens became a permitted dice roll again .
Although I approve of the aim ( to make the game get started more quickly ) , I did n't much like the mechanism ; re-rolling a pair of dice until you get a result you like seemed ugly .
So I set out to design a special pair of dice which would produce the numbers 2 to 12 with the same relative probabilities as the ordinary 2d6 , but which never rolled 7 .
This sounds pretty unlikely , but it 's just about possible .
In this page I explain how it 's done .
Construction
An ordinary pair of dice can roll any number from 2 to 12 , but not all with the same probability .
The easiest way to see this is to label the individual dice to distinguish them ( I 'm going to call them R and C , for " row " and " column " ) , and draw a table showing the possible outcomes :
So out of the 36 possible combinations that can come up , only one results in a 2 ( both dice have to show 1 ) , only one results in a 12 ( it requires two sixes ) , but a seven can come up in six different ways and is therefore six times more probable .
The idea I hit on was to reorganise this grid .
With six entries reading 7 , I thought it might be an interesting experiment to put them all in the same column :
That leaves a 5 - by - 6 square .
Interestingly , we have to place 5 instances of the number 6 in the remaining space , and also 5 instances of the number 8 .
I thought those would fit nicely across two rows of this 5 - by - 6 rectangle :
This leaves a rectangle four spaces high , and it just happens that I have four 9s and four 5s to place , so let 's place those in two of the columns :
And so it goes on .
In two rows of the remaining 3 - by - 4 space we place the three 4s and the three 10s ; in two columns of the remaining 3 - by - 2 we place the two 3s and the two 11s ; and in the two remaining single spaces we place the single 2 and the single 12 .
This reorganised grid contains the same set of numbers as the grid we originally started with , and each number appears exactly as many times in the new grid as in the original one .
So if you roll two ( distinguishable ) ordinary dice , and look up the results in this table ( for example , if die R rolled 3 and die C rolled 5 , you 'd look up the overall result in row 3 column 5 and find it was 4 ) , then you will find that this technique gives you exactly the same distribution of numbers which you 'd expect from ordinary dice .
Of course , having to use a look - up table every time you roll your dice is a bit silly .
Better to re-label the dice to make the table unnecessary .
And it turns out this is fairly easy :
The entire first column of the table is full of 7s .
So it makes sense to label that face of the C die " 7 " , since if it comes up then the answer is 7 no matter what the other die does .
The first two faces of the R die should be labelled " 6 " and " 8 " , since that will be the result if one of those faces comes up ( unless the C die shows 7 ) .
Similarly , the next two faces of the C die should be labelled 5 and 9 , and so on .
The last face of the C die we leave blank .
If that face comes up , then the result is whatever is shown on the R die .
So after we relabel the dice , the outcome grid now looks like this :
Now all we need is a way to remember which numbers take priority over which other numbers .
The rule is : 7 beats 6 and 8 , which in turn beat 5 and 9 , which beat 4 and 10 , which beat 3 and 11 , which beat 2 and 12 , and everything beats the blank .
So we add dots to the faces : six dots on the 7 , five on the 6 and the 8 , four on the 5 and the 9 , three on the 4 and the 10 , two on the 3 and the 11 , one on the 2 and the 12 , and nothing on the blank face .
So our dice now look like this :
And the procedure is : roll both dice , and choose whichever of the two uppermost faces shows more dots .
( No draw is possible , since any two faces with the same number of dots appear on the same die . )
So , after all this work , I 've constructed an alternative way of labelling a pair of cubical dice , which gives exactly the same probability distribution as the normal approach of adding up the two numbers rolled .
How has this helped me to construct dice which do n't roll sevens ?
The answer is that 7 is now a property of one of the dice , rather than a property of the combination of the two .
All I have to do to convert these dice into a non -7 - rolling pair is to remove the 7 face from the C die , turning it into a five - sided die with faces 3 , 5 , 9 , 11 and blank .
This modified pair of dice has the following outcome table :
So it will roll everything other than 7 with the correct relative probabilities , but it can never roll a 7 itself , because there is n't a 7 face anywhere to be seen .
Bingo !
Actually making a d5 would be difficult .
Instead , I bought a standard d10 ( two five - sided pyramids back to back ) , and painted pairs of faces the same .
Extension
The above construction fulfilled my original goal .
I acquired some blank dice and labelled them in the way I 've described ( I could n't find a blank d10 so I had to paint out the numbers on an ordinary one ) , and when I 'd finished , I had two " odd " dice ( one cubical , with a 7 , and one shaped like a d10 , without a 7 ) and one " even " die .
Roll the two cubical dice , and you get an ordinary 2d6 distribution ; roll the even die with the strangely shaped odd die , and you get the same thing but with no 7s .
However , there was one remaining problem .
Settlers of Catan has an extension , called " Cities and Knights " .
In this game , one of the dice is red , and that die has a special function : the total of the two dice still determines the resource generation for the turn , but the single number shown on the red die has an additional effect of deciding who gets special cards .
My dice do n't provide this extra information .
And you can't just roll an ordinary die alongside my two , because that gives rise to combinations which would have been impossible with ordinary dice ( there 's no way the red die can show 6 if both dice total 4 , for example ) .
So it appears that my dice can't be used for Cities and Knights without changing the nature of the game .
Or can they ?
They can certainly work in principle .
All you need to do is to annotate each entry in the outcome grid with an additional number indicating the value on the red die .
Going back to the ordinary 2d6 , the annotated grid looks like this ( let 's have R be the red die ) :
This grid is n't terribly easy to read , but it at least shows which red numbers can go with which total numbers :
If the total is 2 , the red number must be 1 .
If the total is 3 , the red number can be 1 or 2 .
If the total is 4 , the red number can be 1 , 2 or 3 .
If the total is 5 , the red number can be 1 , 2 , 3 or 4 .
If the total is 6 , the red number can be 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 or 5 .
If the total is 7 , the red number can be 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 or 6 .
If the total is 8 , the red number can be 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 or 6 .
If the total is 9 , the red number can be 3 , 4 , 5 or 6 .
If the total is 10 , the red number can be 4 , 5 or 6 .
If the total is 11 , the red number can be 5 or 6 .
If the total is 12 , the red number must be 6 .
So what we could do is to take the outcome grid for my modified dice , and arbitrarily put these annotations in some order :
This works on paper : it generates both the total and the red number , with the same distribution as the original 2d6 , and removing the 7 face on the C die still does the right thing .
But it 's ugly , because there 's no particular structure to the arrangement of the red numbers in the grid , so we 're back to needing a lookup table .
It would be much nicer if we could find some way to arrange the red numbers which made it possible to figure out what was going on without a lookup table .
After some experimentation , I discovered that it all looks much nicer if you sort the faces of the dice into numerical order , counting " blank " as zero .
This makes the totals grid look a lot less obvious :
But it produces an astonishingly simple way to arrange the red numbers .
In this grid I 'm going to show only the red numbers , to make it clearer just how simple this is :
I have honestly no idea whatsoever why this is so beautifully symmetric .
My dice are n't symmetric ; I 've removed all the symmetry between the dice in the course of making my strange mechanism work .
Yet , for no obvious underlying reason , this completely regular arrangement of red numbers just works , producing the right set of possibilities for every possible total .
This was totally unexpected to me , and I still do n't really understand it .
But there it is .
So , given this arrangement , it 's not too hard to find some extra labels to put on the faces of my dice .
The simplest thing is to write red numbers on the faces of the even die , so that 2 , 4 , 6 , 8 , 10 and 12 are annotated with the numbers 1 , 2 , 3 , 4 , 5 and 6 respectively .
Then we annotate the odd die as follows :
The blank face remains completely blank , indicating that the red number on the even die is the correct red number .
The 3 face is labelled " +1 " : you add 1 to the red number shown on the even die ( 6 is considered to " wrap round " and go back to 1 . )
The 5 face is labelled " + 2 " : you add 2 to the red number on the even die ( 5 wraps round to 1 , 6 wraps round to 2 ) .
The 11 face is labelled " - 1 " : you subtract 1 ( and 1 wraps round to 6 ) .
The 9 face is labelled " - 2 " : you subtract 2 ( 1 goes to 5 , 2 goes to 6 ) .
On this basis , the 7 face could be labelled " + 3 " or " - 3 " , but since the only actual requirement is that every possible red number should be able to come up when the total is 7 , the simplest thing is just not to annotate the 7 face at all .
This breaks the beautiful symmetry of the table , but it 's easier when actually rolling the dice .
So our completed dice now look like this :
Now the procedure is : roll both dice .
To find the total , choose whichever of the two uppermost faces shows more dots .
To find the red number , take the red number shown on the even ( R ) die , and modify it by the amount shown on the odd ( C ) die if any .
If an addition takes you above 6 , subtract 6 from the result ; if a subtraction takes you below 1 , add 6 .
And , once again , removing the 7 face from the odd die produces a pair of dice which never roll 7 , and this time they generate both totals and red numbers , so these could be used for Cities and Knights .
Evaluation
The mechanism I 've described above works nicely on paper , but unfortunately it has a practical disadvantage , which is that it 's unusually sensitive to imperfections in the dice .
The normal procedure of rolling 2d6 and adding the values together has the effect of spreading out the overall effect of an imperfection .
Suppose you roll two normal dice , for example , and one of them is a bit more likely to roll a 3 than it should be .
The effect on the overall distribution of the sum of both dice is that 4 , 5 , 6 , 7 , 8 and 9 are all more likely than they should be , but by one sixth as much , because the random value from the other die distributes the error over a wide range .
So the normal procedure is naturally quite tolerant of faults ( or even deliberate weighting ) in the dice .
Not so with the mechanism I describe above .
If the even die rolls 8 25 % more often than 6 , then 8 will come up 25 % more often than 6 in the overall result ; the whole of the error in one die is propagated to the overall result .
And because Settlers treats every distinct roll of the dice as qualitatively different rather than just a bit more or less of a continuously varying quantity , minor imperfections in the dice have a severe and noticeable impact on the game play .
In actual fact , since starting to play Settlers with my dice , we have been constantly annoyed by apparently unfair behaviour of the dice over the course of entire games ; we have n't gone as far as doing actual statistical tests of my dice 's accuracy , but it certainly seems possible that the phenomenon I describe here is to blame .
A really obvious alternative approach would have been to roll a d6 ( labelled 1 - 6 as usual ) and a d5 ( also labelled 1 - 5 in the obvious way ) , add the results , and then add one if it was 7 or more .
( This generates the Cities and Knights red numbers trivially , as well : simply let the d6 be the red one . )
I initially discarded this approach because it felt inelegant ; I wanted my dice to roll ( say ) a 9 by producing something which was obviously a 9 , rather than producing something that looked like an 8 and requiring you to remember to convert it into a 9 .
( In particular , one manifestation of this elegance property is that with my mechanism the procedure for calculating the outcome is the same whichever of the two odd dice you 're currently using . )
Unfortunately , this inelegant approach might well have been more practical in terms of tolerating flawed dice .
A reader familiar with the range of dice available in roleplaying and gaming shops might also have noticed that a 5 ×6 outcome grid contains 30 possibilities in total , and that you can actually buy 30 - sided dice , so taking a d30 and labelling it 2 , 3 , 3 , 4 , 4 , 4 , 5 , 5 , 5 , 5 , 6 , 6 , 6 , 6 , 6 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 8 , 9 , 9 , 9 , 9 , 10 , 10 , 10 , 11 , 11 , 12 would have been a simpler solution still .
This might have been a bit fault - intolerant at the extreme ends of the range ( with only one 2 face and only one 12 face , having a noticeable imbalance between them would be easy ) , but it would probably work acceptably in the middle of the range ( which is where Settlers players seem to like to spend most of their time if they can arrange it ) because with five separate 8 faces a significant imbalance would be harder to arrange .
However , the real practical problem with this approach is that it 's quite hard to find a d30 large enough to paint replacement labels on !

I ’ve written before about how important spotting trends and taking action can be to growing your brand .
But once your brand has grown from zero to hero on the back of a trend , what do you do now ?
The thing about trends is that once they take off , only one of two things can happen after that .
They either a ) evolve into something else or b ) die out all together .
The trick is finding a way to evolve the brand to extend its relevance to consumers beyond the trend that pushed it to the top .
The shoe companies Crocs and Heely ’s are two examples of brands that took off on trends but have n’t since been able to extend much relevance to their lines .
Despite crude attempts by both brands to inject new life into their products with line extensions such as Crocs high heels and Heely ’s without wheels .
It seems the only direction for both brands down , where the trends that took them to the top will be laid to rest .
TOMS
Shoes is a company that is in a clear search for ways to extend their current relevance beyond the trend brought them success .
I ’m a fan of TOMS Shoes and have even talked about them here a few times before .
Their path to success stems from their promise to the world which states ,
For every pair of shoes you purchase , TOMS will give a pair of shoes to a child in need .
This philanthropic attitude , along with the unique design of their shoes sparked a trend that put their shoes on the feet of celebs such as Scarlett Johansson , Brittany Snow , Brittany Murphy , Tobey Maguire and Lindsay Lohan , and had them featured on Oprah and in magazines like GQ and Vogue .
TOMS in some ways have become Livestrong bracelet of 2008 !
But I think TOMS realizes that favor from the PR gods can only get you so far .
If they want to retain the relevance they have with consumers they must evolve , or just like the Livestrong bracelets they will become a passing fad .
In the last few months TOMS has introduced some new products and tweaks to old products , all in an effort to extend their product offerings into the future .
TOMS Boot Wraps are their newest additions and make quite a fashion statement .
TOMS shirts , hats and canvas bags are nothing new to the line , but the collection seems to keep growing .
One of the challenges for the brand will be to grow their offerings without watering down their founding promise with unrelated products .

Can TOMS
Shoes extend their brand beyond a trend ?
And what should they do to maintain their relevance with their fans ?

Way back in 1999 Martin Fowler published Refactoring — Improving the Design of Existing Code .
Fowler ’s book introduced the world to refactoring as an independent practice , and provides dozens of detailed mechanical recipes , each of which describes the steps needed to change one ( usually small ) aspect of a program ’s design without breaking anything or changing any behavior .
To be skilled in refactoring is to be skilled not only in safely and gradually changing code ’s design , but also in first recognizing where code needs improvement — recognition of code smells .
This is where William Wake ’s brilliant Refactoring Workbook ( 2003 ) comes in .
Bill ’s book focuses on Java code smells : Each chapter consists of descriptions of a few major code smells , followed by a number of exercises to work through ( the challenges vary ; some ask you to analyze code , others to assess a situation , still others to revise code ) .
But what if you ’re not a Java developer ?
Good news : Early next year Jay Fields , Shane Harvie and Martin Fowler are publishing Refactoring , Ruby Edition .
It ’s available now as a Safari Rough Cut .
And as if that were n’t enough good news , Bill Wake and I are writing the Ruby Refactoring Workbook .
Compared with Bill ’s original Java Refactoring Workbook our Ruby edition will have a similar overall structure , but is otherwise a substantial re-write .
We have retained the core code smells ( and added a few more ) and re-worked them to apply to Ruby ’s more dynamic environment .
We have replaced all of the code samples , and replaced or revised all of the exercises .
We have also re-written much of the introductory material , mostly to reflect the rise in importance of test - driven development during the last five years .
In short , we ’re trying to create a stand - alone Ruby refactoring workbook for the modern developer , and not simply a Java book with Ruby code samples .
As things stand right now we have three chapters left to write , and a deadline to get the first draft to our publisher next month .
I hope to start releasing draft text into the wild for comment fairly soon , so watch this space if you ’d like to be involved !

Concerns about DMCA takedown abuse and fair use are n't limited to Lawrence Lessig , the EFF , and Free Press — John McCain and Sarah Palin are going all mavericky on the issue as well .
Yesterday , their campaign sent a letter to YouTube complaining about rightsholders ( especially news organizations ) that filed illegitimate DMCA takedown notices and managed to have important campaign clips pulled at crucial times .
The letter is yet more evidence of why human judgment — not just automated filtering or scanning — is crucial in such cases .
The letter opens by talking about how important YouTube has been for the campaign 's efforts to get out copies of commercials , speeches , etc. , but notes that the site 's usefulness is being curtailed by " overreaching copyright claims . "
Many of these claims have involved " fewer than ten seconds of footage from news broadcasts in campaign ads or videos , as a basis for commentary on the issues presented in the news reports . "
If that sounds to you like a classic " fair use " of such material , you 're not alone .
The McCain / Palin campaign calls these " paradigmatic examples of fair use " and even runs through the four factors that govern fair use exceptions .
But " despite the complete lack of merit " to the claims , the videos were pulled as per YouTube 's policy .
The campaign can file a counternotice , of course , and YouTube will eventually put the videos back up ( at this point , if a rightsholder still believes the takedown request was valid , he or she can sue the creator of the video ) .
But this process does n't move at either " Internet speed " or " campaign speed , " and having crucial attack videos down for days at a time is apparently hurting the campaign .
So the campaign proposes that YouTube get proactive in these cases and do manual review .
Should YouTube screeners conclude that the use is fair , the takedown notice should simply be ignored .
As the campaign points out , YouTube only has to act on " infringing " material ; if it does n't infringe , there 's no need to pull it .
It 's not always clear , of course , whether something is infringement and , given what 's at stake for YouTube 's ability to remain a " safe harbor , " we 're skeptical that the company will adopt the proposal .
Because human screening of these complaints requires both people - hours and some significant training in fair use and copyright , it 's likely to be expensive .
To address that issue , the McCain campaign suggests that human screening apply only to political campaigns .
It 's refreshing to see mainstream politicians ( or at least their operatives and lawyers ) speaking up for fair use and showing an understanding of the problems caused by overly - aggressive systems for flagging possible violations .
Perhaps when those at the highest levels of government — not just the mothers of dancing toddlers — understand the problems here , a better copyright balance can be struck .

Electricity first transmitted commercially from Niagara Falls
The Niagara Falls are a natural illustration of pure power .
And tucked within them is their man-made companions , gargantuan electrical power production facilities ( the largest in the world ) , that harness the prodigious elemental forces .
But five years before start - up of the first large - scale power project at the falls , the method of production and distribution of the power was still undecided .
The huge project was to include transmission to Buffalo .
Electricity - - a novel technology at the time - - was only one suggestion .
The other methods under consideration were pneumatic , hydraulic , and good old - fashioned mechanical ( compressed - air or water mains or steel cables on posts and pulleys the 22 - mile distance from Niagara Falls to Buffalo ) .
The new technology won out in the end .
On this day in1895 the Niagara Falls Power Company began generating alternating current ( AC ) from three 5000 - horsepower generators .
The next year electricity was successfully transmitted to Buffalo .
The Niagara Falls project ushered in the second phase of the Industrial Revolution and shaped and determined the way power would be produced and delivered from then on .
The first use of Niagara Falls Power Company electricity was by the Pittsburgh Reduction Company ( later to be renamed Aluminum Company of America ) , which used an electrolytic process invented by James M. Hall .
The company was founded in Pittsburgh in 1886 but transferred operations to Niagara Falls during this period because of the prospect of cheap and reliable electrical power .
The second electrochemical industry in Niagara Falls also transferred from the Pittsburgh area .
The Carborundum Company produced the extremely hard silicon carbide compound using a process invented by Edward G. Acheson .
Founded in Monongahela , Pennsylvania , in 1891 , in that year the company used 135 horsepower of electricity to produce 45 tons of product .
Its contract of 1894 with the Niagara Falls Power Company was for 1000 horsepower , with which it increased its output twenty - fold .
Within a decade , the Carborundum Company was using 5000 horsepower of electricity .

Cro-Magnon man skeleton discovered in France
On this date , an almost perfectly preserved Cro-Magnon male skeleton , about 34,000 years old , was discovered by Swiss - German antiquities dealer and historian Otto Hauser .
He was a member of a party hunting for fossils in the Combe - Capelle rockshelter , France .
The Cro-Magnons are the earliest known European examples of Homo sapiens , living between 35,000 and 10,000 years ago , whose skeletons were first discovered in March , 1868 .
They were anatomically identical to tall and muscular modern humans , but slightly more robust on average .
Finely crafted stone and bone tools , shell and ivory jewelry , and polychrome paintings found on cave walls all testify to the cultural advancement of Cro-Magnon man .

First televised Major League baseball game
Broadcast on station W2XBS , the station that was to become WNBC - TV , announcer Red Barber called the game between the Cincinnati Reds and the Brooklyn Dodgers at Ebbets Field in Brooklyn , New York .
At the time , television was still in its infancy .
Regular programming did not yet exist , and very few people owned television sets -- there were only about 400 in the New York area .
Not until 1946 did regular network broadcasting catch on in the United States , and only in the mid-1950s did television sets become more common in the American household .
By today 's standards , the video coverage was somewhat crude .
There were only two stationary camera angles :
The first was placed down the third base line to pick up infield throws to first , and the second was placed high above home plate to get an extensive view of the field .
It was also difficult to capture fast - moving plays : Swinging bats looked like paper fans , and the ball was all but invisible during pitches and hits .
Nevertheless , the experiment was a success , driving interest in the development of television technology , particularly for sporting events .
Though baseball owners were initially concerned that televising baseball would sap actual attendance , they soon warmed to the idea , and the possibilities for revenue generation that came with increased exposure of the game , including the sale of rights to air certain teams or games and television advertising .

Soviet Union announces successful test of ICBM
In 1953 , the USSR initiated , under the direction of the Ukrainian reactive propulsion engineer Sergey Korolyov , a program to develop an intercontinental ballistic missile ( ICBM ) .
Korolyov had constructed the R - 1 , a copy of the German V2 based on some captured materials , but later developed his own distinct design .
This rocket , the R - 7 , was successfully tested in August 1957 .
In the United States , the development of ballistic missile systems was slowed in 1956 - 1957 , when the Eisenhower administration made large cuts in defense spending in an effort to balance the budget .
However , on October 4 , 1957 , the Soviet Union used an ICBM to launch Sputnik , the first man-made satellite .
Sputnik 's impact was immediate and dramatic .
The US missile program was given renewed impetus , restrictions were lifted , previous program priorities were reinstated , and funding was vastly increased .

Investigators issue final report on the Space Shuttle Columbia disaster
The Space Shuttle Columbia disaster occurred on February 1 , 2003 , when the Space Shuttle Columbia disintegrated over Texas during re-entry into the Earth 's atmosphere .
All seven crew members were lost .
The loss of Columbia was a result of damage sustained during launch when a piece of foam insulation the size of a small briefcase broke off the Space Shuttle external tank ( the main propellant tank ) under the aerodynamic forces of launch .
The debris struck the leading edge of the left wing , damaging the Shuttle 's thermal protection system ( TPS ) .
While Columbia was still in orbit , some engineers suspected damage , but NASA managers limited the investigation on the grounds that little could be done even if problems were found .
On August 26 , the Columbia Accident Investigation Board , or CAIB , issued its report on the accident .
The report confirmed the immediate cause of the accident was a breach in the leading edge of the left wing , caused by insulating foam shed during launch .
However , the report also delved deeply into the underlying organizational and cultural issues that led to the accident .
The report was highly critical of NASA 's decision - making and risk - assessment processes .
It concluded the organizational structure and processes were sufficiently flawed that compromise of safety was expected no matter who was in the key decision - making positions .
An example was the position of Shuttle Program Manager , where one individual was responsible for achieving safe , timely launches and acceptable costs , which are often conflicting goals .
The CAIB report found that NASA had accepted deviations from design criteria as normal when they happened on several flights and did not lead to fatal consequences .
One of those was the conflict between a design specification stating the thermal protection system was not designed to withstand significant impact damage and the common occurrence of impact damage to it during flight .
The board made recommendations for significant changes in processes and culture .
Following the loss of Columbia , the space shuttle program was suspended .
Less than a year after the accident , President Bush announced the Vision for Space Exploration , calling for the retirement of the space shuttle fleet following the completion of the International Space Station and the development of the Crew Exploration Vehicle .
NASA planned to return the space shuttle to service around September 2004 .
That date was pushed back to July 2005 .
On July 26 , 2005 , Space Shuttle Discovery cleared the tower , marking NASA 's return to space .
Overall the flight was highly successful , but a similar piece of foam from a different portion of the tank was shed , although the debris did not strike the Orbiter .
Due to this , NASA once again grounded the shuttles until the problem was solved .
After delaying their re-entry by two days due to adverse weather conditions , the shuttle safely returned to Earth on August 9 , 2005 .
The second " Return to Flight " mission , launched on July 4 , 2006 , after two previous launches were scrubbed because of lingering thunderstorms and high winds .
The launch took place despite objections from its chief engineer and safety head .
A five - inch crack in the foam insulation of the external tank gave cause for concern ; however , the Mission Management Team gave the go for launch .
Space Shuttle Discovery touched down successfully on July 17 , 2006 .
On August 13 , 2006 , NASA announced during this last launch of the Discovery , more foam had shed than they expected .
While this did not delay the launch for the next mission , originally set to lift off on August 27 , the weather and other technical glitches did , with a lightning strike , Hurricane Ernesto and a faulty fuel tank sensor combining to delay the launch until September 9 .
On September 19 , landing was delayed an extra day to examine Atlantis after objects were found floating near the shuttle in the same orbit .
When no damage was detected , Atlantis landed successfully on September 21 .

BIRTHS
1873
Lee De Forest ( Born Aug 26 , 1873 ; died Jun 30 , 1961 )
Lee de Forest is most known for his contributions and improvements to the basic invention of all radio and television : the vacuum tube .
Earlier Thomas Edison 's electric lamp had been modified by the Englishman , Ambrose Fleming , who added a second element , called a plate , and called it the Fleming Valve .
By 1906 de Forest had modified Fleming 's Valve by adding a grid to control and amplify signals , and called his device the Audion .
The Audion was used as a detector of radio signals , an amplifier of audio and an oscillator for transmitting .
The first use of the Audion was as a detector of radio waves .
A detector converts radio frequency , RF , into audio frequency , AF , that can be heard using headphones or amplified for a loudspeaker .
Moving to California in 1910 , he worked for Federal Telegraph Company at Palo Alto .
While there , de Forest finally made his Audion tube perform as an amplifier and sold it to the telephone company as an amplifier of transcontinental wired phone calls .
For this innovation he received $ 50,000 .
By 1916 , he had perfected his Audion for its most important task , that of an oscillator for the radiotelephone transmitter .
By late 1916 de Forest had begun a series of experimental broadcasts in New York City .
According to de Forest , " The radio telephone equipment consists of two large Oscillion tubes , used as generators of the high frequency current . "
Lee de Forest lived in Hollywood and also worked on a variety of non-radio technical devices , most notable his Phonofilm process , a way to make the movies talk by adding a synchronized optical soundtrack to the film .
For that 1920 invention , the first sound - on - film process , he received in 1959 an honorary Oscar from the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences .

Albert Bruce Sabin ( Born Aug 26 , 1906 ; died Mar 3 , 1993 )
Sabin was a Polish - American physician and microbiologist best known for developing the first oral polio vaccine in 1955 .
Sabin developed a live - virus vaccine that was first tested in 1954 .
By that time , however , the killed - virus vaccine developed by Jonas Edward Salk ( 1914 - 1995 ) , had already been developed and tested and was commercially available in 1955 .
The Salk vaccine , which is injected , proved effective in sharply reducing the number of poliomyelitis cases in the US .
Sabin , however , persisted in his efforts to develop a vaccine based on a living virus .
He postulated that live , attenuated virus , administered orally , would provide immunity over a longer period of time than killed , injected virus .
By 1957 he had isolated strains of each of the three types of polio virus .
These strains were not strong enough to produce the disease itself but were capable of stimulating the production of antibodies .
He then proceeded to conduct preliminary experiments in the oral administration of these attenuated strains .
The vaccine was developed by him and his colleagues at the University of Cincinnati .
Co-operative studies were then conducted with scientists from Mexico , The Netherlands , and the Soviet Union , and finally , in extensive field trials on children , the effectiveness of the new vaccine was conclusively demonstrated .
In 1958 and 1959 the vaccine was tested in millions of people in the Soviet Union between and proved successful .
The Sabin oral polio vaccine , commonly administered on a lump of sugar , was approved for use in the United States in 1960 and became the main defence against polio throughout the world .
People vaccinated with Sabin 's vaccine only infected others with a much weakened version of the disease and this conferred immunity to the unvaccinated population too .
It was licensed in 1961 and became the vaccine of choice in most parts of the world .

DEATHS
1950
Ranson Eli Olds ( Born Jun 3 , 1864 ; Died Aug 26 , 1950 )
Ransom Eli Olds was a pioneer of the American automobile industry , for whom both the Oldsmobile and Reo brands were named .
He claimed to have built his first steam car as early as 1894 , and his first gasoline powered car in 1896
He founded the Olds Motor Vehicle Company in Lansing , Michigan , on August 21 , 1897 .
The company was bought by a copper and lumber magnate named Samuel L. Smith in 1899 and renamed Olds Motor Works .
The new company was relocated from Lansing to Detroit .
Smith became President while Olds became vice president and general manager .
In 1901 Olds designed the Curved Dash Oldsmobile which sold for $ 650.00 .
It was this car , rather than Henry Ford 's Model T , that was the first mass - produced , low - priced American motor vehicle .
Although the factory was destroyed by fire that year , the company still sold over 600 models of the Curved Dash .
Olds created the assembly line in 1901 , although most credit Henry Ford , whose contribution was to refine the process and perfect the standardization of components .
This new approach to putting together automobiles enabled him to more than quadruple his factory ’s output , from 425 cars in 1901 to 2,500 in 1902 .
In 1904 sales were up to 5000 units .
As Smith 's son , Frederick , came into the business , he and Olds clashed frequently until Fred Smith removed Olds from the position of vice president and general manager in 1904 and Olds left his company .
He went on to form the R.E. Olds Motor Car Company .
Its name was quickly changed to Reo Motor Company to avoid a lawsuit from the Olds Motor Works .
The name REO came from the initials of his name as an acronym .
Olds served as president ( until 1925 ) and later chairman of REO .
It was REO Motor Company that manufactured one of the first ancestors of the pickup truck , a motor truck called the REO Speed Wagon ( insert appropriate power - ballad joke here ) .
The Olds Motor Works was bought by General Motors in 1908 .
The Oldsmobile brand , after a production run of 107 years , was discontinued by General Motors in 2004 .

Charles A. Lindbergh ( Born Feb 4 , 1902 ; Died Aug 26 , 1974 )
Lindbergh , Charles Augustus ( 1902 - 1974 ) , an American aviator , made the first solo nonstop flight across the Atlantic Ocean on May 20 - 21 , 1927 .
Other pilots had crossed the Atlantic before him .
But Lindbergh was the first person to do it alone nonstop .
In 1924 , Lindbergh enlisted in the United States Army so that he could be trained as an Army Air Service Reserve pilot .
In 1925 , he graduated from the Army 's flight - training school at Brooks and Kelly fields , near San Antonio , as the best pilot in his class .
After Lindbergh completed his Army training , the Robertson Aircraft Corporation of St. Louis hired him to fly the mail between St. Louis and Chicago .
He gained a reputation as a cautious and capable pilot .
On May 20 , Lindbergh took off in the Spirit of St. Louis from Roosevelt Field , near New York City , at 7:52 am , carrying sandwiches and water .
He decided against carrying a parachute and radio in favor of more gasoline .
He landed at Le Bourget Field , near Paris , on May 21 at 10:21 pm , Paris time ( 5:21 pm New York time ) .
Thousands of cheering people had gathered to meet him .
He had flown more than 3,600 miles ( 5,790 kilometers ) in 33 1/2 hours .
In 1941 , he joined the America First Committee , an organization that opposed voluntary American entry into World War II .
Lindbergh became a leading spokesman for the committee .
He criticized President Franklin D. Roosevelt 's foreign policies .
He also charged that British , Jewish , and pro-Roosevelt groups were leading America into war .
Lindbergh resigned his commission in the Army Air Corps after Roosevelt publicly denounced him .
Some Americans accused Lindbergh of being a Nazi sympathizer because he refused to return the medal he had accepted .
After the Japanese attacked Pearl Harbor on Dec. 7 , 1941 , Lindbergh stopped his noninvolvement activity .
He tried to reenlist , but his request was refused .
He then served as a technical adviser and test pilot for the Ford Motor Company and United Aircraft Corporation ( now United Technologies Corporation ) .
In April 1944 , Lindbergh went to the Pacific war area as an adviser to the United States Army and Navy .
Although he was a civilian , he flew about 50 combat missions .
Lindbergh also developed cruise control techniques that increased the capabilities of American fighter planes .
Lindbergh died of cancer on Aug. 26 , 1974 , in his home on the Hawaiian island of Maui .
After his death , he was buried on the beautiful grounds of the Palapala Ho'omau Church .
“ The life of an aviator seemed to me ideal .
It involved skill .
It brought adventure .
It made use of the latest developments of science .
Mechanical engineers were fettered to factories and drafting boards while pilots have the freedom of wind with the expanse of sky .
There were times in an aeroplane when it seemed I had escaped mortality to look down on earth like a God . ”
– Charles A. Lindbergh , 1927

And the answer to today ’s quiz ?
The event which took place on this day in 1883 , and produced the most violent explosion known in human history : The Eruption of Krakatoa .
Krakatoa has erupted repeatedly throughout recorded history .
However its most well known eruption culminated in a series of massive explosions on August 26 - 27 , 1883 : the most violent volcanic event in modern times .
With a Volcanic Explosivity Index of 6 , it was equivalent to 200 megatons of TNT - about 13,000 times the yield of the Little Boy bomb ( 13 to 16 KT ) that devastated Hiroshima , Japan .
The 1883 eruption ejected more than 25 cubic kilometers of rock , ash , and pumice , and generated the loudest sound historically reported .
The cataclysmic explosion was distinctly heard as far away as Perth in Australia ( approximately 1,930 miles away ) , and the island of Rodrigues near Mauritius ( approximately 3,000 miles away ) .
Near Krakatoa , according to official records , 165 villages and towns were destroyed and 132 seriously damaged .
At least 36,417 ( official toll ) people died , and many thousands were injured by the eruption ; mostly from the tsunamis that followed the explosion .
In the year following the eruption , average global temperatures fell by as much as 1.2 degrees Celsius .
Weather patterns continued to be chaotic for years , and temperatures did not return to normal until 1888 .
The eruption injected an unusually large amount of sulfur dioxide ( SO2 ) gas high into the stratosphere which was subsequently transported by high - level winds all over the planet .
This led to a global increase in sulfurous acid ( H2SO3 ) concentration in high - level cirrus clouds .
The resulting increase in cloud reflectivity would reflect more incoming light from the sun than usual , and cool the entire planet until the suspended sulfur fell to the ground as acid precipitation .
The eruption darkened the sky for days afterwards , and produced spectacular sunsets throughout the world for many months .
British artist William Ashcroft made thousands of color sketches of the red sunsets half - way around the world from Krakatoa in the years after the eruption .
In 2004 , researchers proposed the idea that the blood - red sky shown in Edvard Munch 's famous 1893 painting " The Scream " is also an accurate depiction of the sky over Norway after the eruption .
Munch said : " suddenly the sky turned blood red ... I stood there shaking with fear and felt an endless scream passing through nature . "

I ’m not sure how many of you read the article I wrote this morning about the Pentagon ’s “ troop cut freeze ” in Iraq .
I ’m not just mentioning it here because I ’m hoping to get my readership up ( though if that ’s a side effect , I sure wo n’t complain ) , rather I write this because of an article on the exact same topic that CNN.com put up around the same time .
While my story is based on the reports already out there publicly , CNN sites all sorts of “ sources ” .
Both articles say much the same thing , but what strikes me is the dramatically different tone .
On 9/11/07 , General Petraeus predicted the troop level would be down to 130,000 by this summer .
In April of this year , the AP said the pause would leave over 100,000 troops in Iraq by the time President Bush leaves office .
The reality is that 146,000 troops are still there , and the Pentagon is urging the President to keep them there until he is out of office .
Then , and only then , they suggest that 7,500 troops could be pulled out of Iraq , and most of them would end up in Afghanistan .
These are the facts as I presented then this morning .
Here is what CNN said :
The top U.S. general in Iraq is recommending nearly 8,000 troop cuts in Iraq because of the improving situation there , a source close to the process has told CNN .
Nowhere is it mentioned that what they ’re actually proposing is a several - month - long further delay of already planned troop cuts .
And what is the deal with “ because of the improving situation there ” featuring so prominently in the opening paragraph ?
What sense does that make ?
The situation has improved so much that a year later we still can’t reduce troops to the pre-surge level the General in charge predicted a year ago when he said the surge had accomplished all its goals ?
Can someone explain that to me ?
NEW YORK ( Reuters ) - A security hole in Adobe Systems Inc ADBE .

The problem exposes online video content to the rampant piracy that plagued the music industry during the Napster era and is undermining efforts by retailers , movie studios and television networks to cash in on a huge Web audience .
“ It ’s a fundamental flaw in the Adobe design .
This was designed stupidly , ” said Bruce Schneier , a security expert who is also the chief security technology officer at British Telecom .
The flaw rests in Adobe ’s Flash video servers that are connected to the company ’s players installed in nearly all of the world ’s Web - connected computers .
The software does n’t encrypt online content , but only orders sent to a video player such as start and stop play .
To boost download speeds , Adobe dropped a stringent security feature that protects the connection between the Adobe software and its players .
“ Adobe is committed to the security of all of our products , from our players to our server software .
Adobe invests a considerable amount of ongoing effort to help protect users from potential vulnerabilities , ” it said in a statement .
Adobe said it issued a security bulletin earlier this month about how best to protect online content and called on its customers to couple its software security with a feature that verifies the validity of its video player .
An Amazon spokesman said content on the company ’s Video On Demand service , which offers as many as 40,000 movies and TV shows on its
Web site , cannot be pirated using video stream catching software .
However , in tests by Reuters , at least one program to record online video , the Replay Media Catcher from Applian Technologies , recorded movies from Amazon and other sites that use Adobe ’s encryption technology together with its video player verification .
“ Adobe ’s ( stream ) is not really encrypted , ” said Applian CEO Bill Dettering .
“ One of the downfalls with how they have architected the software is that people can capture the streams .
I fully expect them to do something more robust in the near future . ”
HOW IT WORKS
The free demo version of Replay Media Catcher allows anyone to watch 75 percent of anything recorded and 100 percent of YouTube videos .
For $ 39 , a user can watch everything recorded .
One Web site -- www.tvadfree.com -- explains step - by - step how to use the video stream catching software .
Amazon.com ’s Adobe - powered Video On Demand service allows viewers to watch the first two minutes of a movie or TV show for free .
It charges up to $ 3.99 to rent a movie for 24 hours and up to $ 14.99 to download a movie permanently .
Amazon starts to stream the entire movie during the free preview -- even though it pauses the video on the Web browser after the first two minutes -- so that users can start watching the rest of the video right away once they pay .
“ It ’s the traditional trade - off , convenience on the one hand and security on the other , ” said Ray Valdes , analyst at research group Gartner .
However , even if a user does n’t pay , the stream still sends the movie to the video catching software , but not the browser .
Amazon ’s Video On Demand is the Web retailer ’s answer to declining sales of packaged movies and TV shows and the growth in demand for digital content that can be viewed and stored on the Internet .
Unlike Amazon , videos from Hulu.com , NBC.com and CBS.com are already free although the TV programs are interrupted by commercials .
However , the stream catching software separates the commercials and the program into two separate folders , so people can keep the programs without the advertising .
Hulu.com , a video Web site owned by News Corp 's NWSa .
N
Fox network and General Electric 's GE.N NBC Universal , was the big networks ' answer to YouTube , the popular video - sharing Web site where many users began uploading TV shows and other content owned by media companies .
The networks scrambled to post videos on their own sites in a bid to capture another stream of advertising revenue from a growing audience , but they have struggled with how best to show commercials which fund the programing when played on the Web .
YouTube , which started the online video boom before being bought by Google Inc GOOG.
O for $ 1.65 billion in November 2006 , has also struggled to cash in on its popularity even though its user base continues to mushroom .
DESTROYING BUSINESS MODELS
One possible solution would be to protect the video with a digital rights management ( DRM ) system .
A Seattle - based company called Widevine Technologies has a DRM system that can encrypt online videos using Flash .
“ The fundamental problem here is that Adobe ’s lack of technology is not allowing the business models to be preserved , ” said Widevine Chief Executive Brian Baker .
The lack of content protection , according to Baker , threatens all the business models used today to fund video on the Web .
Apple Inc AAPL.O , which sells movies and television shows at its online iTunes store , uses its own DRM technology called FairPlay , but it only works for video bought on iTunes .
Forrester analyst James McQuivey said he does n’t believe the video stream catching technology will entirely derail the advertising - supported business model used by the networks for online video .
“ It ’s too complicated for most users , ” said McQuivey , noting that file - sharing services like BitTorrent already exist but only a small percentage of people use them .
“ People want something easy to find and easy to use . ”

Rice admits officials approved ‘ harsh interrogation techniques ’
therawstory
David Edwards and Muriel Kane
Secretary of State Condoleezza
Rice recently became the first Bush administration official to admit that high - level discussions of the use of torture had taken place in 2002 and 2003 .
According to a written statement provided to the Senate Armed Services Committee earlier this month and released on Wednesday by committee chairman Sen. Carl Levin ( D - MI ) , officials were told that waterboarding and other “ harsh interrogation measures ” routinely used in a survival training program for US soldiers would not cause “ significant ” harm if used on prisoners .
Rice ’s statement is the first acknowledgment of those meetings by any of the officials involved .
Rice did not name the other officials who were present , but reports last spring based on anonymous sources mentioned Vice President Dick Cheney , then - Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , then - Secretary of State Colin Powell , and then - Attorney General John Ashcroft .
MSNBC ’s Rachel Maddow called the release of Rice ’s statement “ a soul of the nation story , ” noting that torture violates the Geneva Conventions and is a criminal act under the US War Crimes Act of 1996 .
She emphasized that “ we just ca n’t get this issue behind us , ” even with the Bush administration on its way out of office , because “ issues like this , like torture , still define who we are as a country .
It ’s still unfinished business . ”
Maddow was then joined by Alex Gibney , the director of the Oscar - winning documentary Taxi to the Dark Side , an examination of the US use of torture against suspected terrorists .
Gibney agreed that “ I do n’t think it ’s over at all .
…
What ’s not over is how we reckon with the past .
We ca n’t go forward and capture our kind of moral reputation if we do n’t reckon with the past and what we ’ve done . ”
“ Should policy - makers be prosecuted ? ” Maddow asked .
“ Could they be ? ”
“ They could be if politicians had the will to do so , ” Gibney replied .
“ I think , at the very least , a truth commission with subpoena power would be something valuable . …
This is not a case of a few bad apples .
This is a rotten barrel .
And the rotten barrel is the civilian administration . ”
Gibney explained that in the course of making his film , “ I had to interview a number of the guards and interrogators . …
I did n’t come into it with much sympathy for them .
I ended up having a great deal of sympathy for them .
They were scapegoats for a policy that was coming on down from on high . ”
Gibney said he has also wondered why torture keeps being used when it is known to produce unreliable information .
“ I fear that the answer is because they were always getting back the information that they wanted to hear , ” he concluded .
“ And that is what torture delivers . ”

Spore may have been a long - awaited title , but publisher EA surely did n't expect the most talked - about aspect of the game to be its DRM .
Alas , now it seems that all the protest from angry gamers over the restrictive nature of the game has reached the boiling point : following hundreds of scathing , DRM - focused reviews on the official product page , Amazon accidentally deleted customer reviews of the game sometime Friday afternoon ( they have since been restored ) .
Earlier this week , we reported on the mass of negative customer reviews on Amazon 's website drawing attention to the game 's DRM .
As of Monday , there were more than 194 one - star customer reviews — roughly 87 percent of all reviews of the game were negative , most focusing on the DRM .
Over the week , that number continued to grow as more gamers picked up the title and found themselves unhappy .
When the reviews disappeared late this week , there were 2,216 reviews , of which 2,016 were one - star ratings .
Pulling customer reviews is not a terribly common act on the part of Amazon .
Aside from yanking religiously motivated rants on certain religious texts and various fake reviews by people impersonating celebrities and so forth , Amazon has typically been very liberal about allowing its users to express their honest opinions about the site 's products .
The Amazon product page for Spore shows no reviews , just left over negative tags for the game
Strangely , only the reviews on the main Spore retail release have disappeared .
Negative , DRM - related reviews for other editions of the game , such as the " Galactic Edition , " remain posted .
But the main product remains conspicuously bare of customer opinion , with the only traces of protest left being the remaining tags associated with the product by customers which include the likes of " drm , " " limited activations , " and " securom . "
As for the DRM , Spore gives players only three activations over the lifetime of the product .
With each reinstall , the user forever uses up that install : installs are not refunded should the game be uninstalled .
After the three installs are consumed , the only option for a legitimate consumer is to call EA and go through an interrogation of sorts , including questions such as why the limit was reached and where the game was purchased , in order to attain an extra installation .
For the sake of testing , we submitted a new review with a one - star rating that mentions DRM in the body text .
Amazon customer reviews can take up to 48 hours to be posted , with customers encouraged to contact the site 's help staff with questions as to why a given review did not get published .
If there 's a lesson learned from Stardock , which has enjoyed strong success with sales numbers surpassing 500,000 from its recent , DRM - free PC game Sins of a Solar Empire , it 's that gamers do not want DRM .
The long - standing argument holds : DRM only punishes legitimate consumers who want to pay for the software they own .
And even with all this DRM , Spore still hit the web illegally immediately .
EA , and all publishers , should be paying attention .
Gamers have spoken , and DRM on games is futile — whether the criticisms are whitewashed or not .
Update
An Amazon spokesperson says that the reviews disappeared due to a " glitch " in the system .
" The team is working to resolve this issue now and have all the reviews back up on the site , " the spokesperson told Ars .
" Amazon does n't censor or edit customer reviews based [ on their content ] and we'd only remove a review if it fell outside our guidelines . "
The thousands of negative reviews are slowly coming back online .
As of 4:25 pm CDT , all 2,216 reviews were back online , and the average rating is one star .
Reader Melissa sent in word that though the old reviews have been reposted , Amazon may be more aggressively monitoring Spore - related reviews .
Her review was blocked , and upon contacting customer service she was told that her review of the game was removed because it " did not describe [ her ] experiences with the product . "
According to Melissa , her review dealt with " the fact that Securom does not uninstall when you uninstall Spore , and there appears to be problems with Securom interfering with other software and sometimes hardware . "
The nationalization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac shows that the U.S. is " more communist than China right now " but its brand of socialism is meant only for the rich , investor Jim Rogers , CEO of Rogers Holdings , told CNBC Europe on Monday .
" America is more communist than China is right now .
You can see that this is welfare of the rich , it is socialism for the rich … it 's just bailing out financial institutions , " Rogers said .
Stock markets jumped after the U.S. government 's decision to launch what could be its biggest federal bailout ever , in a bid to support the housing market and ward off more global financial market turbulence .
But Rogers said in the long term the move spelled trouble .
" This is madness , this is insanity , they have more than doubled the American national debt in one weekend for a bunch of crooks and incompetents .
I 'm not quite sure why I or anybody else should be paying for this , " Rogers told " Squawk Box Europe . "
European stocks soared on Monday , led by banks .
UBS was up 11 percent , BNP Paribas up 8 percent , Credit Agricole up 11.1 percent and HBOS up 13.8 percent .
" You certainly gonna see a huge jump in any financial institutions which owned a lot of Fannie or Freddie … because they do n't have to worry about going bankrupt all of a sudden , " Rogers said .

MUSIC NEWS - Ang Lee , the Oscar - winning director of Brokeback Mountain , will film a comedy about the landmark music festival , Woodstock for Focus Featuress .
Taking Woodstock is based on a book by Elliot Tiber , who granted the original permit for the historic 1969 event , which became the official " gathering " of the hippie movement .
t and stars Emile Hirsh ( Into the Wild ) , Eugene Levy ( Splash , Waiting for Guffman ) and Liev Schrieber .
Filming is taking place in upstate New York , home of the first Woodstock , with plans on releasing the film prior to the 40th anniversary of Woodstock in 2009 .
Ang Lee , whose credits include The Ice Storm and Hulk , met Mr Tiber at a promotional stop for the book in San Francisco and the film progressed from there .
But , Lee 's spokesman refused to elaborate on any details of the plot .
" I 'm not in a position to discuss details of the film , " said David Lee .
Half a million fans attended the historic music festival which featured The Who , Santana , Janis Joplin , Ravi Shankar , The Band , Alvin Lee , Jimi Hendrix , Joe Cocker among others at the 1969 concert .
The festival was also the subject of a successful documentary film in 1970 .

Researchers at McGill University and the affiliated Lady Davis Research Institute of the Jewish General Hospital - along with colleagues at the University of Ottawa and the Ottawa Health Research Institute ( OHRI ) - report a significant breakthrough in the use of viruses to target and destroy cancer cells , a field known as oncolytic virotherapy .
Their results were published in the September early edition of the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences ( PNAS ) .
The research team , led by Dr. John Hiscott of McGill 's Faculty of Medicine and the Lady Davis Institute , along with Dr. John C. Bell and colleagues at the University of Ottawa and OHRI , have discovered that a family of compounds called histone deacetylase inhibitors ( HDIs ) may be the missing link that turns oncolytic viruses into a potent new weapon against cancer .
Their research program is supported by the Canadian Oncolytic Virus Consortium , which is funded by the National Cancer Institute of Canada ( NCIC ) and the Terry Fox Foundation .
" One of the greatest challenges in cancer therapy is to target and kill cancer cells that are resistant to conventional therapy , " said Dr. Hiscott .
" The strategy that we developed is to use a harmless , non-human virus that specifically enters , replicates and kills cancer cells , but not normal cells . "
However , Dr. Hiscott explained , many primary cancers have proven resistant to a pure virotherapy approach .
" One way to overcome this obstacle is to treat the tumor with other molecules that augment the ability of these viruses to target and kill the cancer cells . "
Dr. Nanh Nguyen and Dr. Hesham Abdelbary , senior researchers and lead authors in the Hiscott and Bell labs , focused on HDIs , which inhibit specific enzymes involved in modulating the structure of chromosomes in cancer cells .
They tested the combination HDI / virotherapy approach in cell culture experiments in the lab , in animal models of cancer , and also in human tissues from breast , prostate and colon cancer immediately after excision from patients .
" Treatment with these compounds dramatically increases the susceptibility of these cancers to killing by the oncolytic virus , " Dr. Hiscott said .
" The combination dramatically and unexpectedly stimulates the ability of the viruses to target and kill cancer cells . "
The researchers utilize a tiny , bullet - shaped insect rhabdovirus known as VSV , chosen specifically for its inability to infect normal human cells .
" VSV has been studied by virologists for several decades , and its replication is well understood at the molecular level , " Dr. Hiscott said .
" It is not a human pathogen , so most individuals do not have antibodies directed against it , which means there is a window of opportunity to successfully treat patients before they mount an immune response . "
Dr. Hiscott and his colleagues are enthusiastic that this new approach may lead to the rapid implementation of new experimental therapies for breast , prostate , colon and other primary cancers that are currently resistant to virotherapy .
" Virotherapy is potentially valuable by adding a new biotherapeutic approach to cancer treatment , " he said .
" Because human trials with similar viruses and with HDIs have already been approved , there is the possibility that the results of these studies might be applied rapidly .
We might see human trials within a year or two .
These experiments are vital to determine if this ' viral bullet ' is actually a ' magic bullet ' that hits the intended target . "

John McCain and Sarah Palin appeared on CBS Evening News Monday night to rebut claims that Palin agrees with Obama 's policy of launching unilateral strikes within Pakistan if there is actionable intelligence that high - value targets are in the area .
According to McCain / Palin , it's " gotcha journalism " when a politician gives their opinion on any given issue .

Couric :
Is that something you should n't say out loud , Sen. McCain ?
John McCain : Of course not .
But , look , I understand this day and age of " gotcha " journalism .
Is that a pizza place ?
In a conversation with someone who you did n't hear … the question very well , you do n't know the context of the conversation , grab a phrase .
Gov. Palin and I agree that you do n't announce that you 're going to attack another country …
[...]
Couric :
What did you learn from that experience ?
Palin :
That this is all about " gotcha " journalism .
A lot of it is .
But that 's okay , too .
How is it possibly a controversial proposition that the United States ought to act , unilaterally if necessary , when the target includes those who are responsible for killing Americans ?
In bizarro Republican world it 's OK to sing a little ditty about bombing a country that never attacked us , but it 's not OK to take out people who actually did .
This truly is silly season .
Jon Perr notes that McCain did in 2002 what he 's now condemning Obama for doing .
When you present yourself on the web , you have 15 seconds to make an impression , so aspiring champions of the web 2.0 industry have converged on a good recipe for success :
Make your site visually appealing , Do something different and do it very , very well , Call users to action and give them an immediate , rewarding experience .
We need the same urgency , immediacy and elegance as part of the free software desktop experience , and that ’s is an area where Canonical will , I hope , make a significant contribution .
We are hiring designers , user experience champions and interaction design visionaries and challenging them to lead not only Canonical ’s distinctive projects but also to participate in GNOME , KDE and other upstream efforts to improve FLOSS usability .
Fortunately , we wo n’t be working in a vacuum .
This is an idea that is already being widely explored .
It ’s great to see that communities like GNOME and KDE have embraced user experience as a powerful driver of evolution in their platforms .
Partly because of the web -2.0 phenomenon and the iPhone , there ’s a widely held desire to see FLOSS leap forward in usability and design .
We want to participate and help drive that forward .
There ’s also recognition for the scale of the challenge that faces us .
When I laid out the goal of “ delivering a user experience that can compete with Apple in two years ” at OSCON , I had many questions afterwards about how on earth we could achieve that .
“ Everyone scratches their own itch , how can you possibly make the UI consistent ? ” was a common theme .
And it ’s true – the free software desktop is often patchy and inconsistent .
But I see the lack of consistency as both a weakness ( GNOME , OpenOffice and Firefox all have different UI toolkits , and it ’s very difficult to make them seamless ) and as a strength – people are free to innovate , and the results are world - leading .
Our challenge is to get the best of both of those worlds .
I do n’t have answers to all of those questions .
I do , however , have a deep belief in the power of the free software process to solve seemingly intractable problems , especially in the long tail .
If we articulate a comprehensive design ethic , a next - generation HIG , we can harness the wisdom of crowds to find corner cases and inconsistencies across a much broader portfolio of applications than one person or company could do alone .
That ’s why it ’s so important to me that Canonical ’s design and user experience team also participate in upstream projects across the board .
In Ubuntu we have in general considered upstream to be “ our ROCK ” , by which we mean that we want upstream to be happy with the way we express their ideas and their work .
More than happy – we want upstream to be delighted !
We focus most of our effort on integration .
Our competitors turn that into “ Canonical does n’t contribute ” but it ’s more accurate to say we measure our contribution in the effectiveness with which we get the latest stable work of upstream , with security maintenance , to the widest possible audience for testing and love .
To my mind , that ’s a huge contribution .
Increasingly , though , Canonical is in a position to drive real change in the software that is part of Ubuntu .
If we just showed up with pictures and prototypes and asked people to shape their projects differently , I ca n’t imagine that being well received !
So we are also hiring a team who will work on X , OpenGL , Gtk , Qt , GNOME and KDE , with a view to doing some of the heavy lifting required to turn those desktop experience ideas into reality .
Those teams will publish their Bzr branches in Launchpad and of course submit their work upstream , and participate in upstream sprints and events .
Some of the folks we have hired into those positions are familiar contributors in the FLOSS world , others will be developers with relevant technical expertise from other industries .
One strong meme we want to preserve is the idea that Ubuntu , the platform team , is still primarily focused on integration and distribution .
We will keep that team and the upstream work distinct to minimise the conflict of interest inherent in choosing the patches and the changes and the applications that actually ship each six months as part of an Ubuntu release .
Of course , there ’s a risk to participation , because you can’t easily participate without expressing opinions , visions , desires , goals , and those can clash with other participants .
It ’s hard to drive change , even when people agree that change is needed .
I hope we can find ways to explore and experiment with new ideas without blocking on consensus across diverse and distributed teams .
We have to play to our strengths , which include the ability to diverge for experimental purposes to see what really works before we commit everyone to a course of action .
It will be a challenge , but I think it ’s achievable .
All of this has me tapdancing to work in the mornings , because we ’re sketching out really interesting ideas for user interaction in Launchpad and in the desktop .
The team has come together very nicely , and I ’m thoroughly enjoying the processes , brainstorming and prototyping .
I ca n’t wait to see those ideas landing in production !

Somewhat belatedly I came across an interesting paper by W Tecumseh Fitch the other day ( Actually I came across Beau Siever ’s discussion of Daniel Dennett ’s discussion of the paper . ) in which he boldly tackles the thorny subject of original intentionality , claiming it ’s all based on what he calls nano - intentionality .
Fitch declares himself a defender of intrinsic intentionality .
Intentionality , as you may know , is aboutness , meaningfulness : things like books and films are said to have derived intentionality : they are about things because the people who made them and the people who read or watch them interpret them as being about something , conferring meaning on them .
But some things , our own thoughts , for example , are not about things because of what anyone else thinks , they just are intrinsically about things .
How they manage this has always been a mystery .
Dennett , in fact , denies that there is any such thing as intrinsic intentionality – how can anything just inherently be about something ?
It ’s this view that Fitch wants to challenge ; strangely , Dennett says it ’s all a misunderstanding and he agrees with Fitch .
How can this be ?
Well , Dennett would be right to reject intrinsic intentionality if it meant that we just say things are magically about things and that ’s the end of the story ; but really when people speak of intrinsic intentionality it is usually a kind of promissory note : they mean , here in people ’s minds is where meaning originates ; we do n’t know how yet , but meanings in minds are different to meanings in books .
Fitch means to say ; this is where meaning originates , and I think I can tell you how .
I think Dennett is comfortable with theories of intentionality which provide a decent naturalistic interpretation – and if that ’s what we ’re doing , he does n’t really care too much whether we ’re calling it intrinsic , or original , or whatever .
Fitch ’s view still seems at odds with Dennett ’s in many ways ; he rejects the idea that computers could have intrinsic intentionality , and in general his ideas would seem to fit well with those of Searle , Dennett ’s arch - enemy .
Searle says that consciousness arises from certain kinds of biological material as a result of some properties of that material which we do n’t understand ( yet – Searle is sure that further scientific research will enable us to understand them ) .
Nanointentionality would seem to fit into that view quite well .
So what is it ?
Fitch says that biological organisms exhibit a responsiveness to their environment which no machine can emulate .
When we ’re cut , we heal up : our flesh extemporises , forming functional but ad hoc patterns of tissue that patch up the gap .
Amoebas and smaller single - celled organisms respond to their surroundings , not just in a pre-organised way , but flexibly , managing to respond and adapt even to new circumstances .
This kind of responsiveness to the environment , in his view , is the elementary precursor to true intentionality : the responses are not , in detail at least , writtn into the organism , and they are , at a basic level , goal - directed .
Having , as he believes , obtained this narrow foothold , Fitch seeks to build on it .
Cells working together can build up an information processing system which inherits from them the spark of aboutness while adding to it new capacities .
When they reach the level where options can be modelled and accepted or rejected , full - blown consciousness and true intrinsic intentionality dawn .
There ’s something a little surprising about this ;
Fitch is relying for most of the work on the kind of functional organisation he otherwise rejects .
At least half of the powers of intentionality seem to come , not from the initial spark , but the way the neurons process information – the sort of thing you might think was perfectly amenable to computation ( I see Dennett nodding happily ) .
It prompts another thought , too : Fitch denies that mere silicon can have the kind of open - ended responsiveness of an amoeba .
If we swap cells for transistors , that may be right ; but what if the computer moves down a notch and simulates the parts ( perhaps even the molecules ) of the amoeba ?
Since Fitch is committed to naturalism , it seems hard to exclude computers from having the properties of living things so absolutely as he wishes .
There is also a problem down there with the nano - intentionality , too .
Fitch sees the responsiveness of the eukaryotic organisms ( he ’s prepared to exclude the prokaryotes ) as having a directedness which prefigures proper intentionality .
But I doubt it .
This directedness is a real and interesting quality , resembling what Grice called natural meaning : those spots mean measles ; that spade means a hole to be dug .
This is a good place to be looking for the roots of intentionality ; indeed , my own view would have them somewhere in this area .
The snag is that natural meaning has a tendency to separate out into two parts ; the fitness of a thing for a result , and derived intentionality .
The first of these has nothing of intentionality in it , properly understood ; a spade may be specially fit for digging , but a large snowbank is especially fit for avalanches ; large black clouds are fit for rain ; there ’s no real meaning at work .
The element of derived intentionality lies in the eye of the beholder ; the spade is about digging because that ’s the way it was designed , and that ’s the way I mean to use it .
This is intentionality , but resoundingly not the intrinsic kind we ’re after .
So , if we look at Fitch ’s amoeba , we can analyse its responsiveness .
In part it ’s simply a fitness to go on surviving no different in principle from the cloud ’s fitness to rain ; in part it ’s a purposefulness which we and FItch ca n’t help reading into it .
Take away these two elements , and the foothold on which Fitch stands disappears , I think .

BELLEVILLE , Mich .  Senator John McCain has spent the week trying to tell people that he feels their economic pain .
So it was more than a little unhelpful when one of his top economic advisers was quoted Thursday as saying that the United States was only in a “ mental recession ” and that it had become a “ nation of whiners . ”
The adviser , former Senator Phil Gramm , Republican of Texas , sought to clarify his remarks Thursday by saying he had been referring only to some of the nation ’s leaders .
But it was too late to keep from complicating things for Mr. McCain , who has been trying to strike a more empathetic tone after sometimes struggling to maintain a balance between displays of optimism about the nation ’s future and demonstrating an understanding of Americans ’ economic hardships .
Senator Barack Obama , noting that Mr. McCain had previously said an expansion of offshore oil drilling might have a “ psychological ” benefit for the country , seized on Mr. Gramm ’s remarks , made in an interview with The Washington Times .

Last week , I had the good fortune of coming across a column written by Kip Layton Jr. , a school administrator in the tiny , remote village of Eek , Alaska .
It was n't fortunate simply by virtue of the entertainment I derive from being able to mention a place called Eek .
Layton 's column provided a valuable insight into what our kids have missed out on by virtue of their ties to the Internet .
Obviously , access to computers in general and the Internet in particular is a godsend , and the sooner such access is universal , the better .
But I was intrigued by Layton 's article , in which he wrote about what happened recently when his school lost its Internet connection .
Suddenly , an ecology class being broadcast to his rural school went off the air , students felt unable to write their papers , and teachers were in a quandary without their Smart Boards ( computerized interactive whiteboards ) .
Layton lamented the cloud of helplessness that settled over the school and harked back to " a time when learning and communication had a more meaningful , personal touch . "
The episode reminded me of a column I wrote several years back , titled " The Lost Art of Handwriting . "
That column was picked up by a number of IDG publications around the world , and I can't think of anything I 've written that drew a more global response from readers who identified with my experience .
Here 's a lightly edited excerpt , offered as a toast to Layton 's piece :
I have a 19 - year - old son who is absolutely brilliant .
He finished high school with a 4.0 grade - point average , scored a 1500 on the SAT , and was accepted for admission to the U.S. Naval Academy .
Yet this brilliant young man has the handwriting of a 4 - year - old .
It 's humiliating .
And why is this the case ?
Because he grew up in front of a keyboard .
Virtually everything he ever did involving the written word was typed .
If there 's anything good to say about his handwriting at all , it 's that it 's not quite as horrible as the " handwriting " of my 14 - year - old son , who has even less experience away from a computer and whose scrawl looks like he was holding the pen between his toes .
With frostbite .
You no doubt have seen the same thing .
People over 35 generally have lovely handwriting .
The 25 - to - 35 age group has decent handwriting .
And the under - 25 crowd is a legibility laughingstock .
It 's all because of computers .
And it 's kind of a shame .
I had lost sight of just how much of a shame it really is until just these past six weeks since my son has been at the Naval Academy .
He has n't had access to a computer all this time , so the only way to correspond with him has been by post .
I clearly could have written the letters on my computer and printed them out , but I did n't .
I suppose the reason is that I can remember as a kid getting letters from my mom and dad and noticing their different styles of handwriting and appreciating that unique personal expression .
I wanted my son to see that same expressiveness and individuality and personality in my correspondence with him , so I 've been writing my letters to him longhand .
Six weeks ago , I probably would have said I do n't have time to write letters longhand .
Turns out I do .
My son will be getting his computer in a couple of weeks , and our correspondence will no doubt shift to e-mail and IM -- the convenience and timeliness are just too compelling .
And I probably wo n't get around to writing letters longhand anymore .
It would be silly , I suppose , because the letters would be so dated .
Too bad .
Do n't get me wrong .
I 'm grateful that we have e-mail and IM , I really am .
And it 's a terrific thing that the kids in Eek have access to the Internet .
But I have a feeling that , given the chance , those kids would enjoy learning about what Layton called " those little white cards in that mysterious chest in the library " as much as I loved writing those letters .

Levi is struggling to revive US sales US clothing maker Levi Strauss has seen profits dive as a result of weak consumer spending and costly new software which disrupted supplies .
The company , famous worldwide for its jeans , said second quarter net profits were down 98 % on last year to $ 1 m .
The group blamed the weak economy and costs related to rolling out new business software that caused shipping delays and dented US sales .
It also said European and Asian consumers had been hit by rising costs .
We 're getting no help from the economy in any of our markets around the world
John Anderson , Levi Strauss chief executive Levi said the results ended two years of healthy profit gains .
The company is struggling to boost sales in the face of falling consumer spending in major global markets , including the US , and it said the rest of the year would be challenging .
Consumer gloom Levi's problems were not confined to the US .
Consumers had cut back on spending as prices for food and fuel increased in European and Asian markets too , the company said .
" We 're getting no help from the economy in any of our markets around the world , " said chief executive John Anderson .
Others factors that dragged profits down was Levi 's retail expansion and poor sales at its casual trouser business Dockers .
The firm owns and operates 48 US stores and is looking for new locations .
Global sales fell 8 % to $ 936 m in the quarter and US sales dropped 19 % .
Analysts said the next quarter would be key as the company traditionally does well when children go back to school .

What are these ?
On Tuesday , September 16 , 2008 , the UC San Diego Center for the Future of Surgery performed the nation ’s first gastrectomy , a partial removal of the stomach , through the vagina .
This new “ natural orifice ” technique may be an attractive alternative for the 200,000 U.S. patients who undergo surgery for the treatment of obesity each year .
“ More than 15 million people in the United States suffer from severe obesity , ” said Santiago Horgan , M.D. , director of the UC San Diego Center for the Future of Surgery and Center for the Treatment of Obesity .
“ The Center for the Future of Surgery at UC San Diego is developing and testing innovative techniques that will offer patients globally more and better treatment options . ”
The sleeve gastrectomy is a weight loss surgery in which 80 percent of the stomach is removed , leaving a slender moon - shaped stomach .
The procedure works by dramatically reducing the size of the stomach so that the patient feels full after eating less , takes in fewer calories , and loses weight .
This is the first time the minimally invasive procedure has been performed in the U.S. through one of the body ’s natural openings .
The patient , Maria Soto , 29 , of Escondido , California , is 5 feet tall and weighed 253 pounds before surgery .
As a six year - old child , Soto suffered from polio which caused permanent disability in her leg , and ongoing back pain , preventing her from exercising regularly .
“ I chose this surgery because I needed to lose weight and wanted a procedure that offered less pain and fast healing .
Years ago , I had my gallbladder removed and the procedure resulted in two post operative hernias .
I did n’t want to risk that again , ” said Soto .
“ I liked this option because there were only two small incisions and a short hospital stay . ”
The 75 - minute procedure at UC San Diego Medical Center was performed with two millimeter - sized incisions versus the five incisions required by a traditional laparoscopic procedure .
One incision was placed in the belly button through which a camera was placed to safely view the abdomen .
The second incision was placed just below the sternum to insert an instrument to retract the liver .
The gastrectomy , or partial stomach removal , was then performed by entering the vagina and making a small incision behind the uterus through which the abdomen and stomach could be accessed with surgical tools .
The stomach was reduced in size using conventional surgical staplers .
The excess stomach was then pulled down through the abdomen and out of the vagina .
The process of performing surgery through a natural opening is known as Natural Orifice Translumenal Endoscopic Surgery or NOTES .
“ This is another milestone for Dr. Horgan and his team at the UC San Diego Center for the Future of Surgery .
Our goal is to continually improve and expand surgery options using emerging technology so that patients experience less pain and better outcomes , ” said Mark A. Talamini , M.D. , professor and chair of surgery at UC San Diego Medical Center and president of The Society of American Gastrointestinal and Endoscopic Surgeons .
The UC San Diego Center for the Future of Surgery has performed 30 natural orifice clinical trial surgeries .
Surgeons at UC San Diego Medical Center were the first in the United States to remove an appendix through the mouth and an appendix through the vagina .
These minimally invasive techniques hold promise for future gastrointestinal and esophageal surgeries including treatments such as tumor removal for cancer .
Members of the surgery team included Santiago Horgan , M.D. , Garth Jacobsen , M.D. , Lauren Fischer , M.D. , Brian Wong , M.D. and James Nguyen , M.D .
A small number of California jails have begun to offer pay to stay programs .
These programs allow inmates in for minor crimes to " upgrade " to a private or public jail with better facilities .
Evidently the fees are profitable to the jails .
Take a look at how Santa Ana county advertises it ’s hotel jail .
The Santa Ana Jail is pleased to host a full range of alternatives to
traditional incarceration .
Our offerings include weekends in jail ,
non -linear jail sentences , and a variety of work release options .
Our
philosophy is designed to allow our clients (! , AT ) to serve their obligations
to the court in a manner that respects them as human beings and permits
them to continue to provide for themselves and their families ….
Programs that include 2 - day or 3 - day weekends with minimal impact on
the client ’s professional life .
Work on Saturday and Sunday ?
No
problem …
the client ’s professional life .
Work on Saturday and Sunday ?
No problem …
Programs that permit jail sentences to be served in multiple parts .
Perfect for clients that live out of the area or clients with frequent
business travel .
Perfect for clients that live out of the area or clients with frequent business travel .
Programs that permit the client to leave jail for work everyday .
We
have helped everyone from 9 to 5 business people to oil - rig workers , so
no work schedule is out of the question .
The Santa Ana Jail is the
most modern and comfortable facility in the region .
Our housing areas
are a world away from cement and steel bars … .
Most clients can be approved immediately , over the phone .
We can also provide same - day acceptance letters for the court .
I have mixed feelings about these programs .
On the one hand , someone has to pay for the jails and who better than the inmates ?
And note that to make an inmate - pays program effective you have to give them an incentive to pay .
But on the other hand the profit - maximizing strategy for a monopolist with different quality levels of service is pretty scary in this context .
A profit maximizer will reduce the quality level of the lowest class service – perhaps even spending money (! ) to make the quality level lower – in order to push people to pay for the higher quality .
( For more on the theory , see Hal Varian ’s elegant explanation . )
On the other hand ( I know , I know , three hands )
California ’s prison system is already so overcrowded , violent and dysfunctional that one federal judge referred to medical care in the CA system as " outright depravity , " thus we may already be close to the lowest quality level .
See this classic MR post for an expert ’s take on the incentives of private and public prisons .

So being an opensource enthusiast and a lover of beer , it just made sense to revive this site and build a great opensource community around the world of brewing .
Originally this site was run by Flying Dog Brewery .
Original Open Source recipe .
As far as malt we have decided to go with Wyerman malt .
We incorporate this malt in some of our other beers and we have had medal winning success .
As far as verities , we are going to keep things on the simpler side .
For the base malt we will be using Munich Type 1 this will constitute 75 % of out total grist bill .
The remaining 25 % will be as follows : 9 % Munich Type 2 , 2 % Cara Munich , and 2 % Cara Amber , and 2 % Melanoidin .
As discussed earlier we have decided to use American grown hops in our Dopplebock .
We have decided on Warrior for our bittering addition and domestic Mt. Hood for our late additions .
Our wort boil will be two hours and our Warrior addition will be 30 minutes into the boil , with a flavor addition at 30 and 15 minutes before end of boil .
We will omit any aroma additions as we are looking to focus on malt aroma .
As far as our yeast selection we have decided to go with Wyeast 2206 Bavarian Lager , which we found to have performed well in our test fermentations .
We experienced a good strong fermentation using this yeast , producing a clean well attenuated lager during our test fermentations .
Although we are not capable of decoction mashing , we are able to steam heat our mash mixer .
Using a suggestion by one of our brewers we will mash this brew in at 140 F then heat it to our 155 F conversion temperature .
Our primary fermentation temperature will be 52 F and will be lagered at 34 F in our cellar for 8 weeks .
Also based on one of our brewer ’s suggestions , we will do something a little different for packaging .
We will give our Collaborator Doppelbock a light filtration then bottle condition in our signature Wild Dog Champagne bottles .
Bottle conditioning may not be a traditional technique for a lager like this , but everything about this project is about being unique .
To simplify the scaling down of our production recipe , percentages will be given in addition to our 50 bbl brew recipe ( two mashes to fill kettle ) to allow brewers of any size system to adapt their recipe .

We feel certain that this will be a unique expression of the style and that the results of our collective project will be quite enjoyable .
Whether you really have a life , you 're in too many leagues already or you just do n't want to join a certain person 's Fantasy Football League because they are a dork , you need to have the Pandora 's Box of heavy rationale ammunition ready to go when " that moment " arises .
Manny Stiles is here to help !
Maybe you 're too nice , maybe you do n't want to hurt their ' feelings ' , maybe you 're too cool to be associated with the dorks , maybe it 's your boss , maybe you just do n't know the person well enough to share their fantasies ... the time will come when you have to turn down an invite to join a FFL .
When ' Fantasy > Reality ' it always =
Dorks
It 's true for television , it 's true for dungeons , it 's true for dragons and it's true for sports ; especially Football .
Let 's face it ; a little interactive fun can be had with any form of entertainment nowadays .
But is it necessary ?
Everything is " reality " based these days .
You can go to online poker tables , you can watch a peep show online , and you can even slap Grand Theft Auto into your game console and kill more people than Hitler .
They have TV shows based on every form of employment - Verminators , Sunset Tan , what 's next , Toll Booth Operators ?
They even have a series dedicated to the annual Madden tournament .
Are we SO starved for entertainment ?
To think that Caveman spent his days peering at his god , the sun reaching across the dome of sky while foraging and hunting and only took clubbing an unsuspecting female and dragging her back to the cave as his only form of entertainment ...
Modern Man , my ass !
Personally , my brand of fantasy sports stars myself , my wife and a moderate flock of her slutty , bi-sexual friends ...
After all , sex is the " sport for all seasons " .
I say if you 're going to have fantasies , the least you can do is make them count !
But I digress from the sleaziest common denominator for a moment .
Why FFL is a cancer to your NFL fanhood
It happens EVERY year .
Even dedicated fans end up in situations they could avoid by living in " reality " in lieu of chasing fantasy .
One ( or more ) of their FFL studs is scheduled to face their favorite team .
It 's a no-win proposition .
There 's no way you can root for your team to win AND have the opposition do well .
Not with a clear conscience !
EVERY point you are rooting for against your favorite team is one more drop of your blood on the contract that sells your fanship soul to the Devil .
Get your 30 pieces of silver and order your eggs ' Benedict ' from now on , traitor ...
If a stud FFL player shreds your team , that will have longer lasting effects than just that week .
Do n't kid yourself .
REAL football is a game of momentum .
If your stud RB exposes your favorite team 's weakness do n't come crying to me the next week when another team exploits the same weakness !
After all , you got kharma lurking around every week of the schedule .
When you have a favorite team , THAT is all that should matter to you .
Do n't sway your allegiances with pretend football .
And since it is your favorite team , that means you 're likely to have several of those players on your roster as well .
That means your stud FFL RB is shredding your defense , or keeping you QB off the field or shutting down your WRs , etc .
You 're screwed even more if your " stud " FFL player is also a division rival - if so , are you stupid or what ?
Just remember , EVERY NFL game your favorite team plays could have lasting effects and impact in the playoffs - a.k.a.
When FFL does n't matter anymore !
Do YOU want to be the person that remembers how your Fantasy RB won week 5 for you when your team is one win out of the playoffs ?
If a butterfly ’s wings can cause damage , imagine what batting your eyelashes at your favorite team 's opponents does ...
The Reasons
" I 'm tired of winning . "
This is really a downright lie disguised as a reason .
No one ever gets TIRED of winning .
But it can get boring beating the crap out of imitation brand football fans .
Truth is , there are more fantasy football players than knowledgeable football fans .
What 's the fun in beating people who can even say T.J. Houshmandzadeh 's name right , let alone people who do n't know what city / conference / division / country the Bengals play in ?
Backfire Potential : The 1908 Chicago Cubs said the SAME thing .
" I 'm tired of losing . "
Maybe true , maybe a cop out , but always easy to sell .
No one wants to congregate with a sourpuss loser .
The more you whine about how you always lose , the more likely people around you will fall into your cone of loserdom .
Backfire Actuality : The 2008 Chicago Cubs will say the SAME thing .
" I do n't like the scoring system of your league "
Follow it up with " Head to head sucks compared to total overall points . " or vice versa and then a " besides , QBs count for more than team depth in your setup " or ask " How many TEs can you start ? "
If they answer one , say you like three .
If they say two , tell them you hate Tight Ends completely .
You get the idea .
Backfire Likelihood :
The dork will do anything to get you into their league - including changing the scoring format .
" I 'm very lazy / too stupid to get the rosters set in time . "
Works great if you can also rattle off a few instances where you forgot to sit your QB on his bye week or when you forgot to put him back in after the bye week .
Ask why kickers and defenses are necessary .
Explain how you party like crazy EVERY Saturday night and do n't get up ( or go to bed ) until the early games start ( This works great if you live in the Pacific time zone where games start at 10 am ) .
Also add in that you do n't have computer access during the week ( " Work blocks Fantasy websites ! " ) to set your rosters up ahead of time !
Backfire Conceivability : Relatively low .
Nothing trumps truly aggressive laziness .
A sit-in , picket signs and a megaphone add that special touch to your passionate apathy .
" I 'm an absentee owner .
I never make trades and I do n't adjust my rosters for bye weeks . "
True or not , make it seem like not only will you forget to set your lineups , you WILL remind everyone every Tuesday morning of that fact .
Insist that you will be smug if you win and twice as smug when you lose .
Fuel for the Backfire : Manny Stiles asks you to join his annual do - nothing autodraft league .
" I 'm in too many leagues already . "
This works in any situation , but beware that if you 're going to have to interact with the person throughout the FFL season , you better be prepared to handle the onslaught .
They 're going to want to talk to you about FFL .
If you really are in too many leagues , then it 's no biggie .
If you are n't in any leagues and did n't want to join theirs SPECIFICALLY because they are a dork , you better be ready to explain the status of your other leagues .
Backfire Inherence : No brainer -
If the dork asks you how your teams are say you do n't want to talk about your teams because they are all in last place .
Mope , mumble incoherently , kick the air and saunter away .
" Fantasy Sports are my addiction and I 'm ready to overcome it ! "
Explain how more than half your paycheck last year went to fantasy magazines , 1-900 hotlines and online projections .
Explain how you met ___( football player 's name here ) ___ and told him how he would have won week 11 for you if he would have had three more yards and go into detail then how he beat the shit out of you .
Explain how you were fired from your last job because you were managing 14 leagues instead of doing the work they were paying you to do .
Add in that " on the positive side " , too many FFLs helped you overcome your black tar heroin " issue " and your veins have never looked better .
Of course that was before the crack ... but now you 're " only " huffing ether and drinking homemade absinthe .
Backfire Chances : None .
No one wants a crackhead OR an ether binger in their FFL .
If they inquire about the homemade absinthe , just say it 's merely " wormwood mixed in rubbing alcohol " and if they want to try some they gotta get their own absinthe spoon first !
( Trust me , this works ! )
The Excuses
" I get screwed in the draft every year ! "
True or not , even though it is , this is the best and worst part of FFL .
It 's like Christmas morning and you know you 're unwrapping so many presents - you just hope they 're not all itchy sweaters and unmatched argyle socks .
No matter what you do , you 're gonna get a sock or two ...
Maybe you get screwed by your draft slot , maybe you get screwed by bad luck , maybe you get screwed by your very own ineptitude ... stop drafting players who have retired , are severely injured or are recently deceased !
Draft day is one of THE only two true redeeming factors of fantasy sports ( the other is winning ) .
It 's not only where you create your dominance or get screwed into a roster of sweaters and socks , it 's also when - if done in person - you get to party .
Either you get too drunk , you get somebody else too drunk or everyone gets too drunk .
Then the pain sets in ...
Inevitably , right off the bat 2 - 3 owners have already lost their season .
Bad picks , dumb picks , ' tricked into ' picks .
Another 2 - 5 owners are scrambling for trades as you 're building a scale model Lombardi trophy out of aluminum foil .
Once the draft is over and all the socks and sweaters are handed out , you 're stuck with the post - draft depression .
This is the roster you must create magic with ...
Sure , winning will ease the dullitude but the funnest , most promising part of the whole season is behind you ... and you get to sit and wait to hear who on your roster gets injured first .
Backfire Predeterminations :
The dork lets you have the first pick and it's not a serpentine draft .
Then you need to fully commit to freeking out over the tremendous pressure of the number one pick .
Scream " It destroys people !
I can't handle it " , and then yell " No , No , Nooooooo ! " over and over while tearing your clothing and pulling out hair from various locations on your body .
" Sorry , my computer crashed .
It must be all that porn ! "
Easy , timely and will usually clear the room of any questioning .
How it could backfire :
If they are REALLY into porn and suffer no shame from asking you about your porn .
Life Changes
" I have a new girlfriend / boyfriend , etc . "
Or really freek them out and say you have a new girlfriend AND a new boyfriend !
This requires a decent amount of self - confidence and security in your true sexuality to pull off properly .
Or severe narcissism .
Then they wo n't ask you to join their fantasy basketball team , either !
Backfire Implications :
The dork is so smitten by your open sexuality and coolness that they want to join your dirty love harem .
Easy way out -
Look them up and down really slowly and say " I might be half - gay , but I could never be THAT gay " ...
( The half - gay part is the part that loves you some you ) .
" getting married " , " new baby " , " new house " , " new job "
These are things that say " No thanks , dork .
I 'm an emephing adult . " without the subtleties .
You know , these are the things that are supposed matter more than games of fantasy anyway .
Backfire Guarantee : Your new spouse / child / house / job destroys your life and then you look back years later and wish you'd have just played more fantasy sports while you had the chance ...
" I 'll join your FFL if you join my new church .
Do you like the taste of goat 's blood ? "
Have this next line ready - " Our religious practices are protected by the Constitution , so we get to eat the unborn goat fetuses without prosecution OR persecution !
Try to avoid this one with overt Raiders fans .
Serious Backfire Alarm :
You might end up auguring national sporting events if you try this on the wrong person .
Downright Lies
" I have n't kept up with the NFL in years ! "
You know this one 's a lie .
But you gotta sell it .
Mention that Marshall Faulk is due for another good season .
Spin a yarn about how weird it will be to see Daunte Culpepper throwing to Randy Moss on the Raiders .
Once you get a few of these gems out , keep 'em coming !
" I ca n't believe Drew Bledsoe 's durability " , " Mike Ditka saved the Saints " , " Terrell Davis is the MAN ! "
Backfire Quotient :
The dork has n't kept up either and agrees with your insights .
You 're on your own here !
" I do n't have time to design a cool team logo this year . "
You have enough fake football team names to last three lifetimes and more than enough logos to start three new leagues on your own .
Hell , half of the fake team logos you 've designed have already been printed into T - shirts and your sewing wizard mother - in - law has already pumped out home and away , a third alternate ( purple leopard fur with sequins for the numbers ) and even retro jerseys in your size with your fantasy team 's logo ( Stone Crunk Ultrapimps , for instance ) on it - from each of the last 4 years !!!
You have window decals of your past fantasy teams still on your car .
And your new personally fitted helmet should arrive in the mail any day to add the homemade decals you 've had sitting around for the past two months .
OK , maybe this one 's just me !
" I do n't want to jinx my favorite players this year . "
Madden , Chunky Soup and Jessica Simpson have NOTHING on you !
Every year you draft guys from your favorite team (s ) and WHAMMO !
They are either hurt , maimed , rendered suddenly ineffective , stop taking steroids , shot at while at a strip club , " accidentally " OD on sleeping pills , arrested for running a dog fighting ring , bit by a snake , injure their sternum while getting the Heimlich maneuver after choking on Chunky soup , or are suspended for dropping their whizzinator during the drug test .
No matter what the situation , it will happen to YOUR players .
Backfire Possibilities 1 : I know a guy who was a human jinx to his FFL so one year he wanted to spare his favorite team by purposely picking players from division rivals to jinx them .
Not only did he win the league utilizing his rival 's players but his favorite team ( who was considered a Super Bowl contender in the pre-season ) lost their QB in week 4 , went 5 - 11 and their coach quit midseason ( knowing he was getting fired ) while a division rival went to the Super Bowl unexpectedly .
Backfire Possibilities 2 : This is CODE RED worst case scenario ... YOU start to date Jessica Simpson .
" It was my Dad 's dying wish that I never play fantasy sports ever again "
Your Dad wanted you to get out of lots of things .
Backfire Inevitability : If your Dad is still alive , this might kill him .
Besides you 're a sick , twisted individual and therefore we 'd make great friends !
" My significant other will withhold fornication / copulation / sodomy / hot dinners if I join another league . "
Meanwhile , you go join another fantasy league with your significant other 's friends instead of the dork 's league .
Backfire Potential :
If significant other hears about this , they just might hold it to you , then you have to go out and cheat on them to get even ... that can get messy and expensive .
The Truths
" I 'm focusing on rooting for my real team this year and dedicating myself fully .
No misdirected allegiances and no traitorship THIS season ! "
This really is the best excuse .
What FFL person is going to question you once you explain that you 're a REAL football fan with no time for ' games ' ?
Most FFLers are in Fantasy leagues to make the NFL a more interesting experience , but they 'll never get the feeling of being a TRUE fan .
In their face !
" I have better things to do "
Of course you do .
We all do .
Backfire Warning 1 : No you do n't .
Backfire Warning 2 : If you use this line on a boss ( or the like ) , they WILL find you some " better things " to do right away .
" I 'm not jinxing , reverse jinxing , double - blind jinxing or Triple Sideways Lindy Dogdare Pinky Swear jinxing my team this year . "
Not a bad way to go , it 's noble and pure ; especially if you 're a Cowboys , Jaguars , Titans , Chargers , Seahawks , Jets , Buccaneers , Redskins , Eagles , Broncos , Vikings , Texans , Bengals , Ravens , Bills , Cardinals , Browns , Saints , Panthers , or Packers fan .
If you 're a Patriots fan , you 're screwed because I am DEFINITELY jinxing them again this year anyway ...
Backfire Supposition :
If your favorite team is the Falcons , Bears , Rams , Lions , 49ers , Chiefs , Raiders or Dolphins , you 're not fooling anyone ; not even yourself .
" I 'd rather bet on the games than take your cash "
In for - money FFLs , this is a no-brainer .
You 're obviously the gambling type in which a few hundred bucks from some computer geek FFL players would n't raise a single goose bump or you 're such a crappy gambler that you 're out of cash and waiting for a possible payoff three months down the road is a slow death .
A half - decent gambler can earn more winnings at the sportsbook / bookie in the 1:00 games in one weekend alone than a FFL player can winning three leagues at once !
People who need to add cash to make fantasy games more relevant are the worst gamblers there are .
Adding a monetary stake to fantasy based games is lame .
Not only are they crappy sports fans , but they make crappy gamblers too .
Why not just put Madden in the Playstation , play CPU vs. CPU and bet on the outcome ?
Backfire Affirmation :
You can lose more in one Sunday than can make all year ; especially if you 're REALLY stupid .
" Is n't it bad enough that I already ______ ( fill in the blank ) ______ more than you ? "
This is the catch all .
Not only does it rid you of the effort of managing a FFL team with someone you 'd rather not deal with , it also rids you of a person you 'd rather not deal with !
Point out their most glaring weakness and explain why it 's oddly enough your God - given talent .
It not only switches the focus from FFL to their self - perceived inadequacies , but it also forces them to hate you .
Two birds with one stone if you ask me .
Works great in the job setting .
Backfire Expectation :
The meaner you are to someone , the more likely they will have something spectacular happen in their life .
You do n't know how many people I degraded that later won lotteries and / or huge lawsuit payouts .
Upside - they are still dorks .
Downside - they can afford to hire a hitman .
" I'm on ArmchairGM.com so much that it's an unfair advantage "
Self explanatory .
You know your shit and can pretend to know the rest by stealing / " editing " everyone else 's ideas here !
Backfire Deja Vous ( Yes , Vous ) :
You 're reading articles posted from the wrong authors ( read : people who are in a FFL WITH you ) that are only written to undermine YOU .
Q . What will you miss most by not being in a FFL ?
A. Pretending .
That 's about it ...
If you have a chat function in your league , you might miss out on some quality smack talk but that 's it ( or you could save it for AGM ) !
No fake trophies .
No pretend championship rings .
No " league records " to break ...
Q. What will you Gain by Not being in a FFL ?
A. Actually watching and enjoying REAL football .
One string attached , no crossed wires and no spiteful allegiances .
Living in Fantasy = Individuals gain meaningless yards in a blowout loss and you reap the points .
BUT you end up watching the Dolphins lose to the Bills 54 - 13 JUST to see if your backup tight end does well .
Even though you did n't play him this week , you are scouting him to see if you should get another tight end instead .
This rots your brain .
Living in Reality = the star guy who would have been on your FFL team does crappy but makes a crucial downfield block on the winning score and your favorite team wins .
You glow at the fact that his block meant more than any of his 19 yards receiving did .
BUT you do n't care what happens in the Sunday Night game because instead of watching it to see how the kicker you would have had on three of your seven FFL rosters does , you 're going to go get laid instead .
The Tao of Stiles
If you 're good friends with someone , you will have fun no matter if you 're in a FFL together or not .
Good friends always understand .

Login : Password : Remember Me Register The Molecular Virology of Lexotan32 : Metamorphism Illustrated
Thursday , August 16 2007 16:58.00 CDT
Author : orr # Views : 59177 Printer Friendly ...
Introduction
This paper is a direct descendent of my previous one regarding the metamorphic engine of the W32 .
Evol virus .
I advise you to take a look at it before reading this one , or at least be acquainted with the subject of metamorphism .
The focus of this paper is the special engine of the Lexotan 32 virus .
The virus was released in 29A#6 Virus Magazine in 2002 , the Annus Mirabilis of metamorphic viruses .
The virus was created by the prolific VX coder , Vecna , and was one of the last complex creations of this kind .
I could further elaborate on the genealogy of this virus , but I think it is sufficient to say that this virus is a culmination of many of the techniques developed throughout the author 's career .
To be honest , I never thought that this paper would be written , as the virus was released with its original source code , thus no real point in reverse engineering it .
I 've been glancing at it from time to time , but I never went too deep .
Eventually , I decided that the only way to understand what 's going on was to compile it – and that 's when I first began to realize the beauty :
This is the header of the compiled binary , which may look pretty straightforward for many people , but those who are used to looking at binaries will know the difference .
Usually , the section names and purposes ( highlighted ) are chosen by the compiler / assembler , and tend to be very generic , but this program was something else .
At that moment I knew this is going to be interesting .
Concept
Perhaps one of the most difficult aspects in the design of a viral metamorphic engine is the issue of Re-Generation .
The viral code processed by such engine is subject to obfuscation which includes insertion of random junk instructions as well as replacement of one instruction with an equivalent set of instructions .
Unless monitored , the code will simply grow beyond proportion within a certain amount of generations ( as in the W32 .
Evol virus ) .
Several viruses solved this problem in creative ways ;
The TMC virus ( DOS ) used tables that stored the entire virus binary commands and their lengths , while the MetaPHOR virus used a de-permutation module and instruction shrinking module in order to achieve the goal of extracting “ clean ” , un - obfuscated virus copy .
Lexotan32 solves this problem in a very elegant way .
A special table , Genotype ( G ) , is attached to the metamorphed code ( M ) .
The engine will use the entries of this table in order to extract the clean virus copy ( P ) .
The pseudo - algorithm is as follows : P = BuildBodyFromGenotype(M , G ) M' = MixBody ( P ) G' = BuildGenotypeFromBody (M ')
Now , imagine the following metamorphed code :
Scary , eh ?
The above code is so obfuscated , that even a human reader will find it hard to understand ; how will a machine be able to clean it ?
Re-Generation
It is quite evident that the rebuilding mechanism is inspired from nature .
The real life Genotype is the genetic information encoded in our genes .
The Genotype structure determines specific visual characteristics of a resulting Phenotype , which is , in our case , the metamorphed body .
One Genotype may result in several different looking Phenotypes , just as in the virus .
The Genotype , in the viral sense , is a list consisting of signed WORD values .
Each member of the list is a relative pointer to the next instruction in the buffer .
The first item on the list ( 0x3D ) is in fact the pointer to the first instruction ; by adding the second item to the first ( 0x3D+0x FFC6 = 0x3 ) , we get the pointer to the second instruction - and so on .
Additionally , the Genotype may contain two possible flag values :
- 2 ( 0xFFFE ) - FREE4GARBLE directive .
directive . - 1 ( 0xFFFF ) - End of Genotype list .
The FREE4GARBLE directive , along with the next list item , notifies the engine on which registers are currently used , and will be translated into a XOR ESP , VALUE in the output buffer .
The engine will later use this information in order to add intelligent garbage instructions .
Mutation
After getting to the correct location , the engine will get the length of the instruction and store it in the output buffer .
During this phase , the engine will perform instruction transformations based on a random factor .
The engine is able to perform the following :
Original Transformed ADD reg , imm SUB reg , -( imm ) MOV reg , reg / imm PUSH reg /imm
POP reg SUB reg , reg XOR reg , reg TEST reg , reg OR reg , reg LODSx MOV ACUM , [ esi ]
ADD esi , SIZE STOSx MOV ACUM , [ esi ]
ADD edi , SIZE CMD reg , imm8 CMD reg , imm32 DEC reg SUB reg , 1 INC reg ADD reg , 1 * CMD = ADD / ADC / SUB / SBB/XOR / CMP * x = { B , W , D} , ACUM = {AL , AX , EAX} Although some of the transformations above result in growth of code , all of them are reversible , meaning that the engine is able to randomly obfuscate ( expand ) or optimize ( shrink ) the code .
The above example illustrates both the extraction of the plain code and instruction transformations :
Original Transformed PUSH EBP
POP ESP MOV EBP , ESP SUB EAX , 0FFFFEDCCh ADD EAX , 1234h
Permutation
After generating a clean copy from the Genotype , the engine will permutate the code in a rather unusual way .
On the first phase it will create a pool of NOPs ( 0x90 ) , and will copy one or more instructions from the plain code into random locations inside that pool .
In order to retain the logical code flow , all the instruction blocks will be linked with jumps .
During this phase , the engine will add garbage instructions based on the FREE4GARBLE directive .
On the second phase , all the byte sequences will be collected into one buffer by removing the NOPs in between them .
At this point , while running the code in a debugger , I was n't looking at opcodes - I was staring at small genes floating inside a Primeval Soup , perfectly reordering themselves in a chaotic manner , forming life .
Garbage
Another interesting thing is t he issue of garbage generation .
The main idea is blending legitimate instructions with purely random instructions , without altering the code - flow .
Many poly - viruses used commands that were not likely to change the code flow ( for example CLC / CMC / NOP , or ADD EAX,0 and the likes ) but those are now very easily detected by heuristics .
Another method was nesting garbage instructions inside PUSH - POP combinations , allowing the code - flow to remain unaltered , but that resulted in detectors that scanned the stack for magic values .
The garbage engine of Lexotan is able to generate instructions that are very common in legitimate code .
As witnessed , after the initial regeneration process , the engine will extract XOR ESP , VALUE instructions based on the FREE4GARBLE directive .
The value is a flag notifying the engine about possible use of registers and flags .
For example : XOR ESP , 100001 b ( 21 h )
Is the equivalent of : FREE4GARBLE _EAX+_EBP
The engine will replace these instructions with random instructions that do n't use the specified registers , allowing garbage to be run without altering the original code flow .
The XOR ESP instructions throughout the metamorphed code will eventually be replaced with garbage LEA instructions .
Among the instructions the engine may generate are : - MOV reg1 , reg2 - MOV reg , imm - LEA reg , [ r+disp ] - CMD reg , imm ; ADD / ADC / SUB / SBB/XOR / CMP
- INC reg - DEC reg
The registers and immediate values can be of any size ( 8/16/32 bit ) .
Eventually , the resulting code will look this :
Relocations
After all the transformations were applied , most ( if not all ) locations of the original instructions are changed , forcing the engine to fix all the branch instructions ( JMP / CALL ) that link parts of the code together .
The engine copies instructions from an input buffer to an output buffer , and during the transformation process it keeps track of Old vs .
New locations in the form of a two - DWORD table ( eip_table ) .
Another table ( jmp_table ) , keeping information about branch instructions is constructed .
The first member will hold the Branch Destination in the Old Buffer while the second member will hold the Relative Location in New Buffer .
Both values are DWORDS .
Additionally , there 's another BYTE that indicates the size ( either 1 which means a short jmp , or 0 that means near jmp ) .
In order to simplify , let 's try fixing a simple case :
As you can see , the code became smaller by 3 bytes .
Notice that the JNE in the output buffer no longer leads to the RET instruction .
For the above example , the following tables will be constructed :
So , as you can probably deduct , the new relative value to be patched is 01 ( instead of 04 ) , which will fix the jmp instruction correctly .
New Genotype
After the initial Genotype is extracted ( in the regeneration process ) , the engine saves relative locations of instructions in a table called userlist in the same manner and structure of the Genotype .
The userlist functions as an interim Genotype and its values are fixed during the phases of permutation using the same lookup method seen above , as offsets change very dynamically .
After all the transformations are over , the engine will use the userlist in order to generate a new Genotype , for use with the new metamorphed code .
All the XOR ESP instructions will be converted to the format of the Genotype 's FREE4GARBLE directive .
In the next generation , the new Genotype will be used to clean the body from all the garbage and permutation , and will undergo instruction mutations again , thus resulting in an ever - changing base code .
Appendix A : Code as Art
I would n't be able to go about finishing this paper without a little of what my friends and family call ‘ digging ' .
These are some of the thoughts that floated through my mind while studying the virus code .
As this is not the product of a deep philosophical investigation , the definitions I provide are probably not complete and should be taken into account according to their context .
A Language is made of specific Words which are made of specific alphabet .
As such , many compositions can be made in order to form a defined word , and eventually a Sentence .
is made of specific which are made of specific alphabet .
As such , many compositions can be made in order to form a defined word , and eventually a .
A Computer Language generally consists of Instructions , composed of a defined set of commands , whose purpose is to define an Action .
When speaking about definitions and operations , Natural Languages and Computer Languages share a similarity : both can be formalized .
The simplest example can be found in Newton 's Second Law :
Language Implementation English The Force on a particle is proportional
to the Time rate of change in the product
of its Mass and Velocity .
Assembly mov eax , mass mul eax , velocity div eax , time mov force , eax C Force = mass * velocity / time ; F = m * v / t ; Math
In the above example we go from the lowest to the highest levels of abstraction .
Now , we should carefully examine this table :
The English sentence provides instructions on how to calculate the force of a moving body using verbs and nouns while the Assembly code uses word - like commands and variables .
Both sentences have one thing in common that the others do n't :
The English sentence uses Conjunctions ( and other descriptive words ) and the Assembly code uses Registers .
In the C and Math representations , however , we can see that although meaningful names can be used , the commands ( first given in English form ) have now become operators , and the Modus Operandi was now replaced with a formula .
In the world of Software , the purpose of High - Level languages is to formalize blocks of instructions into more abstract and unavoidably generic constructs .
Due to its low - level nature , the Assembly language ( like English ) provides the coder with many more nuances to achieve the desired action , semantically , while the C language provides a more abstract and flexible form .
This is , of course , without insulting the fantastic C language .
When coding High - Level statements such as IF , FOR and WHILE you can sometimes feel like you are speaking directly to the compiler , but in the realm of bit-manipulation and optimization , the Assembly coder is the artist .
Now , as witnessed , it is possible to turn the English sentence into a set of commands .
You can also transform that sentence into a poem , and skilled writers can probably create a hybrid of the two forms .
What defines one variation as more artistic than the other ?
The answer lies in the manifestation of the concept .
Code is not about telling a story , it 's about instructing the computer on how to perform certain actions .
It 's not what you are doing ; it 's HOW you do it .
The source code of Lexotan32 itself is a very customized Assembly source .
It is filled with macros and custom - directives and was written in a way that forces a custom pre-processor to be run prior to compilation .
At first it might alienate the reader , but as you go deeper you can come across very amusing macros such as ‘ coin ' whose purpose is to return a random number between 0 and 1 .
The author could have done that in different ways , but instead he chose to flip a virtual coin in order to determine some of the next actions .
Another example can be seen in the disassembler module , where the complexity and diversity of the Intel instruction set is broken down into a simple yet dominant macro .
The author of Lexotan32 was dealing with problems already encountered before , yet implemented them all in very original ways– Regeneration ( Genotype ) , Permutation ( NOP Pool ) and Garbage ( FREE4GARBLE ) , all wrapped up in a custom PE file – all of those are examples of colorful coding .
The source code was Assembly poetry , the concept was inspired and carefully crafted , the execution was filled with imagination and vision and the binary output was simply fantastic , every time anew .
Code can be Art .
Q.E.D .
Appendix B : The Genealogy of Lexotan32
Since we are dealing with art , we must also take a look at the ideas that preceded and contributed to the final creation .
It is also quite interesting to note the development of certain concepts as well as their sometimes embryonic implementation .
Although this subject diverges from the scope of this paper , I decided to include a very brief history of the development of this virus through other viruses created by Vecna .
1. Miss Lexotan 6mg
The first Lexotan virus was actually a DOS metamorphic virus written in 1998 which was followed by several variants .
The metamorphism model that was first introduced is similar to the one that can be found in the PLY virus .
Every instruction was to be padded with NOPs , so that all instructions could have a fixed length of 5 bytes .
90 nop 90 nop 90 nop 90 nop 1E push ds 90 nop 5B pop bx 90 nop 90 nop 90 nop B8 F0 FF mov ax , 0FFF0h 90 nop 90 nop
This way , the engine does n't have to worry for relocations .
The main virus body would be encrypted ( early Genotype ) , and the engine would unpack it using a small built - in length - disassembler , and would again randomly pad the instructions with NOPs on the next generation .
In the next major variant ( 0.3 ) , NOP padding was replaced by the unique garbage engine :
BA 06 FB mov dx , 0FB06h B9 75 02 mov cx , 275h 1E push ds 5B pop bx BE 4A A7 mov si , 0A74Ah BF 05 95 mov di , 9505h B8 F0 FF mov ax , 0FFF0h
In version 0.6 and forth , the metamorphic engine was able to support instruction mutations , similar to the ones found on the 32 bit version .
2. RegSwap
The same year , Vecna released one of the first metamorphic viruses for the Windows 95 platform , RegSwap .
In this virus , all the instructions remained the same , but with different register usage on every generation .
In order to achieve that , Vecna introduced the idea of using tables with relative distances and information regarding register indexes .
The table would travel with the virus , the same way the modern Genotype was used .
3. Ramones
In 2001 , Vecna released the W95 .
Ramones worm , which utilized an early version of the same permutation and garbling engine seen in Lexotan32 ( the MixBody module ) .
This engine ( that was also published in XINE # 5 ) was almost identical to its final version found in Lexotan32 .
A visual diagram describing the evolution of Lexotan :
Ending
As I said in the beginning , the source - code of this virus is in fact available for everyone to examine , and the fact is that it holds many other interesting features such as the infection mechanism , the mixing of variables , compression , encryption and many other unique implementations .
Unfortunately , those subjects had to be left out of this paper , but I advise the curios reader to examine them more closely .
What I did was just compiling and running the code .
The rest was just like watching a movie through Hex dumps .
Vecna -
Thanks .

John Harwood on CNBC : McCain will own any market sell - off today .
Dow dropped 130 points in first two minutes of trading …
" Waving the bloody shirt " was the phrase once used to describe the standard demagogic tactic of the late 19th century , when memories of the Civil War were still vivid and loyalists of both parties could be moved to " vote as they shot . "
As the years passed and the memories faded , the shirt got gorier , the waving more frantic .
In 1896 the Democrats chose William Jennings Bryan as their leader , a man who was born in 1860 and had thus missed the Civil War , but who seemed to threaten the consensus politics of the time .
In response , ...
If you want to gauge just how integral Sarah Palin has become to John McCain ’s hopes of winning the presidency , consider this :
On Tuesday , when the Republican nominee went before the cameras to address what , at that moment , looked like financial Armageddon , he repeatedly referred to how much better off people would be under “ a McCain - Palin administration . ”
No major party candidate in living memory has campaigned under such a formulation , but McCain has his reasons .
In electoral terms , Palin is McCain ’s meal ticket .
She is consistently drawing larger crowds than he does , though his numbers also have increased since the Alaska governor ’s selection .
And what can anyone call those knots of lipstick - waving women at her rallies except “ Palinites ” ?
Perhaps more important , the vice presidential nominee is outstripping McCain in media coverage .
Last week , according to the nonpartisan Pew Research Center ’s weekly analysis of campaign journalism , Palin figured in 53 % of all stories concerning the presidential race .
McCain was mentioned in 49 % .
By way of comparison , Barack Obama came up in 61 % of all the campaign coverage last week , while his running mate , Joe Biden , was mentioned just 5 % of the time , despite a packed calendar of public appearances .
In an election cycle studded with the unexpected , Palin is a phenomenon whose outsized impact seems to rest on three factors .
Advertisement
The first is the culture of celebrity ’s increasing penetration of our politics .
Celebrity long has been the dominant force in much of our popular culture , but , up to now , it has touched our politics only glancingly .
It should be noted that Obama also benefited from this trend early in his race against Hillary Rodham Clinton for the Democratic nomination .
Celebrities can be distinguished from candidates in a couple of ways .
Candidates have a record to examine and a program to propose .
Celebrities have a story to tell .
In fact , a good story is the essence of celebrity .
Whatever your politics , both Obama and Palin have dynamite life stories -- different , but each compelling in its own way .
It ’s the infatuation with her life story that leads people inclined to admire her not to care when Palin repeatedly lies about her involvement with the so - called bridge to nowhere in her stump speeches .
Nobody cares whether what she says about it is true , because it fits so neatly into her “ story ” -- moose whacker , “ hockey mom , ” PTA president - turned - governor , the common - sense reformer .
( Anybody remember a movie called “ Dave ” ? )
When the McCain campaign introduced Palin , it chose as the theme music the score from the 1993 film “ Rudy , ” a biographical movie about an undersized football player named Daniel “ Rudy ” Ruettiger who surmounted 27 rejections of his application to Notre Dame and actually made it onto the field as a player for the Fighting Irish .
Somebody somewhere is calculating your subliminal susceptibility .
Advertisement
The second pillar of Palin ’s appeal is her claim to represent and to speak for a Main Street America that resides somewhere “ out there ” in the small towns and the rural hinterlands .
Demographically , of course , the majority of American voters now live in precincts deemed suburban .
In fact , Palin ’s Wasilla is considered by the census as a suburb of greater Anchorage , right down to the strip malls and big - box stores .
In any event , the suburbs are where most Americans have lived and cast their votes since the general election of 1992 , when the traditional urban - rural divide exited our politics .
Still , the notion of a simpler , more innocent small - town and farmstead America retains a powerful emotional appeal , particularly when it comes to economic issues .
At a time when so many Americans , their lives disrupted and distorted by the convolutions of the financial markets , are watching the little guys ’ homes go into foreclosure while the Wall Street smart guys walk away with millions from the carnage they ’ve created , there ’s a great deal of angry nostalgia to be tapped .
Finally , there ’s the fact that the religious right was spoiling to get into this election and was frustrated when McCain -- whom many of the movement ’s leaders dislike and distrust -- sewed up the nomination .
They ’d virtually resigned themselves to sitting this one out until the Arizona senator reassured them on a key issue by striking this language from the party platform :
“ We invite all persons of good will , whether across the political aisle or within our party , to work together to reduce the incidence of abortion . ”
Advertisement
Palin ’s selection closed the deal .
Never before has the evangelical right had one so clearly its own on a national ticket .
George W. Bush talks the talk , but Palin , especially when it comes to style , walks the walk .
If you want to calculate the cumulative effect of these three factors , consider this : Since Palin was chosen , the number of McCain supporters who tell pollsters they are “ enthusiastic ” about the ticket has risen from 24 % to 48 % .

( NewsTarget ) Mushrooms have been used for thousands of years by traditional eastern healers but only recently by western healers in advanced medicine .
Mushrooms are often classified as a vegetable or an herb , but they are actually fungi .
Mushrooms provide our bodies with the nutrients , proteins , minerals , and vitamins it needs to generate energy and repair cells .
They are one of the most remarkable elements for a healthy immune system .
They have been used to cure or improve eyesight , hearing , circulation , impotency , stop migraine headaches , tumors , influenza , and even cancer .
Mushrooms are low in carbohydrates , calories , and sodium and are cholesterol and fat free .
High in fiber and protein , mushrooms are also rich in B vitamins to help maintain a healthy metabolism .
Mushrooms are an excellent source of potassium , a mineral that helps lower elevated blood pressure and reduces the risk of stroke .
One medium portabella mushroom has even more potassium than a banana or a glass of orange juice .
Mushrooms are a rich source of riboflavin , niacin , and selenium .
Selenium is an antioxidant that works with vitamin E to protect cells from the damaging effects of free radicals .
Male health professionals who consumed twice the recommended daily intake of selenium cut their risk of prostate cancer by 65 percent .
Regular ingestion of mushrooms over long periods of time has been proven to decrease the amount of cancerous cells in the body .
They not only fight and reduce cancerous cells and tumors , but they help prevent more of those cells from forming in the body .
Types of Mushrooms and their Therapeutic Value : Oyster mushrooms are used to strengthen veins and relax tendons .
" Tendon - easing powder " is an effective treatment for numbed limbs as well as tendon and blood vessel discomfort .
Dried Oyster Mushrooms are high in iron which makes them a good blood builder .
Portabellas contain a wide variety of B complex vitamins .
They are also a great source of riboflavin , Pantothenic acid , niacin and a good source of thiamine , vitamin B6 , folate , selenium , lysine , protein , zinc , copper , manganese , and iron .
Morels contain protein , vitamin D and B , riboflavin , niacin , and thiamine that help the body maintain a healthy metabolism .
They also have copper , selenium , and potassium .
They are low in carbohydrates , very low in calories and are fat free , not to mention , they contain very little sodium .
Maitake may best be known for its cancer - fighting properties .
The evidence confirming maitake 's therapeutic value is impressive .
Laboratory studies have shown that maitake extract can block the growth of cancer tumors and boost the immune function of mice with cancer .
Maitake mushroom was found effective against leukemia and stomach and bone cancers .
In addition , many doctors in Japan use maitake mushroom to lower blood pressure and blood lipids .
This mushroom has also been reported to aid digestion by regulating the stomach and intestines , and helps eliminate food stagnation .
Just like Morels , Porcini mushrooms contain copper , selenium , potassium , and protein .
Research has shown that Shiitake lowers cholesterol .
Shiitake also appears to be effective against some of the more serious viruses we face today : HIV and hepatitis B and appears to be a formidable cancer fighter .
Reishi mushroom is particularly beneficial for individuals with asthma and other respiratory complaints .
Reishi is good for respiratory strength and for coughing .
At least one population study confirms this claim .
When more the 2000 Chinese with chronic bronchitis took reishi syrup during the 1970s , within two weeks , 60 to 90 % felt better and reported an improved appetite , according to the article Medicinal Mushrooms by Christopher Hobbs , published in , Jan / Feb 97 .
Several scientists addressed the health benefits of mushrooms in a session in July 2008 at the Institute of Food Technologists Annual Meeting and Food Expo in New Orleans .
Mushrooms are low in calories , cholesterol and sodium , and they provide plenty of fiber and flavor when cooked .
But the big news is that they are high in antioxidants , selenium , riboflavin and other healthful substances that protect the immune system and fight cancer .
Mushrooms contain high amounts of beta - glucans , compounds that occur in the bran of cereal grains and in yeast .
These substances help to keep immune cells in a state of vigilance , guarding against disease , said Lana Zivanovic , Ph.D. , with the University of Tennessee 's Department of Food Science and Technology .
Mushrooms also contain cancer - fighting substances , said Shiuan Chen , Ph.D. , director of surgical research at the Beckman Research Institute in Duarte , Calif .
Chen 's lab experiments show that mushrooms ' cells contain mechanisms that suppress breast and prostate cancer cells .
He is following up his lab work with clinical trials funded by the Mushroom Council .
Results should be out in a year , he said .
Research is showing that mushrooms contain ergothioneine , an antioxidant that contributes to immune support and protection of the eyes , skin , liver , kidneys and bone marrow .
Scientists have unearthed other mushroom benefits including robust amounts of selenium , vitamin D and potassium .
" White button mushrooms have more protein , potassium , copper and selenium than oyster or shiitake mushrooms " , said Robert Beelman , Ph.D. , at Pennsylvania State University 's Department of Food Science .
Whether mushrooms will be consumed more as foods or in supplements and extractions is yet to be seen .
" But a rich opportunity exists in the marketplace " , said Zivanovic .

If you think that the final mission to service the Hubble Space Telescope is going to be boring , you have n't seen this video yet .
Not only the astronauts will be risking their lives as usual at 366 miles above the Earth , but the sheer amount and the difficulty of the tasks - from repairing components to replacing them to installing new gadgets - makes the mission an almost - impossible one , with soundtrack to match .
I never imagined this was going to be such an ambitious and daunting work .
Advertisement
First , there 's the pressure the astronauts are going to be facing .
In addition to the stress of the spacewalks and the manual work in a weightless environment , they know this is not only the final mission , but also a single shot to service the mighty telescope .
If some of the tasks are not completed , there 's no way to return back another time and fix whatever is broken .
The mission crew knows that Hubble is a vital instrument to science - one that keeps expanding our knowledge of the Universe , helping to answer the most crucial question Humanity has ever faced : where the hell do we come from ?- and that the astronauts are men and women of science .
And they are going to be the ones responsible for giving science this amazing tool for ten more years .
Then there 's the time constrain : just eleven days .
As John Grunsfeld - one of the mission astronauts with Andrew Feustel , Gregory Johnson , Megan McCarthur , Michael Good , Scott Altman , and Michael Massimino - puts it : " We got a lot of things we want to repair in Hubble and upgrade in Hubble , and not a lot of time to do it . "
During that short time , this is all the things they have to do :
Advertisement
Repairs
• Repair two failed instruments in space , which is the first time such a task is going to be attempted .
This will be a test to see if Nasa can do this kind of tasks in future missions to the Moon and Mars .
The repairs will require removing 110 ( yes , a hundred and ten ) little screws .
While this seems easy , not only it will take a lot of time in zero gravity , but the screws , like any other floating debris , may become a big problem for the security of the astronauts up there .
G/O Media may get a commission LG 75 - Inch 8K TV Buy for $ 2150 from BuyDig Use the promo code ASL250
• The first instrument to be repaired is the Advanced Camera for Surveys ( ACS ) .
It was installed in 2002 , and then died after being the most used instrument in Hubble for years .
• Then they have to fix the Space Telescope Imagine Spectrograph ( STIS ) .
This is a black hole hunter which also did the first detection and chemical analysis of a planet orbiting another star .
Advertisement
New instruments
• They will install the fanciest , most advanced spectrograph in space : the Cosmic Origin Spectrograph .
Advertisement
• In addition to the COS , they are also going to install the Wide Field Camera 3 .
This new camera is ten times better than the current instrument , and will let us see into the past of the Universe deeper and farther than ever before .
Spacecraft service
• In addition to the pure science aspect of the mission , Nasa also wants to upgrade and fix the spacecraft itself , starting with the gyroscopes , which will be upgraded .
•
They also are going to install a refurbished fine guidance sensor .
Advertisement
• The batteries are going to be replaced for the first time since Hubble went into space .
• A new outer blanket layer , this time a solid shield , will be put on top of the current blanket .
• Thermal insulation will be replaced on several bays of the telescope .
Advertisement
• A new capture instrument will be installed to recover the Hubble at the end of its life .
Seems like a lot to me , but maybe is the Jerry Bruckheimerish soundtrack that makes it all more exciting .
The really exciting part however , if the mission is completely successful , is that Hubble will be better than ever , ready for action for the next ten years .
What does this really mean ?
Awesome eye candy for the next decade .
And maybe showing to us that the origin of the Big Bang is really a huge bowl full of Froot Loops that went horribly wrong during one of God 's breakfast .

The heart of the modern state is the central bank .
By heart I mean the very thing that makes it work , and without which the modern state would quickly wither and die .
It is the thing that makes the money .
As such , it purports to be our stabilizer , our source of employment , the fuel behind the economic growth that brings us technology .
In truth , it does none of these things .
What it does do effectively is prop up the leviathan state and all its pomps .
You would never know this from the textbook , of course .
The subject is rarely mentioned in political science .
Historians treat the establishment of the Fed as an event far less important than the creation of the Department of Labor .
It is interesting how rarely its existence is ever questioned , much less condemned .
Instead , the head of the central bank is fawned over and courted by all sides of the political spectrum .
He enjoys a level of immunity from criticism that no one else in politics has .
Again , this is proof of the extent to which we do not believe in authentic freedom , since it is the central bank that is the true source of the decline of our freedom .
Why do we have such a hard time imagining a world without a central bank ?
In the United States , the central bank was a 20th - century invention .
No central bank of the current sort existed anywhere in the world before the 19th century .
Somehow we got along just fine because the monetary system was self - managing .
It was rooted in real commodities that provided the stable link to real economic activity .
Banks were treated as regular enterprises that had profits and losses , and could succeed and fail .
What guaranteed their stability , even with the evil of fractional reserves , was the competitive system .
All that came to an end , gradually , with the advent of the central bank .
Money lost its connection to anything real beyond the linen paper on which it is printed .
Banks became protected from failure .
Most important , the central bank started to guarantee government debt .
With what did it guarantee that debt ?
More linen paper , stuff which can be printed up without limit .
With this innovation , the fiscal restraint on the state came to an end .
All the talk about congressional authorization of spending and the constitutional restraint on the state became white noise or a tissue of lies .
The people got out of the habit of asking : “ How precisely do you expect to pay for this ? ”
We all just assume that there is some magic money machine out there that will achieve our every dream .
The lack of criticism of the Fed tells you all you need to know .
It is the one sacrosanct institution because it is the most necessary institution to modern statecraft .
Without it , we would n’t fund both welfare and warfare .
We would n’t dream of a world empire and debate policy the way we debate art , as merely a matter of preference .
There would be strict , physical limits on what the state could and could not do .
Most all our debates about politics would come to an end .
The point of the legislature and the executive would be to administer and oversee the state that exists , not dream up ever more far - flung excuses for attempting the impossible .
No politician would plausibly claim the capacity to “ lead us into the future ” because their power to do much at all would be so limited .
Instead of Bush , Clinton , Reagan , Johnson , Truman , and FDR , our president would be more like Cleveland , Harrison , Arthur , Garfield , and Hayes .
You say that you do n’t know anything about those guys ?
That ’s the point .
Deny the dictator the capacity to make all the money he needs at a whim , and his status shrinks dramatically .
The central bank is sacrosanct because its absence would force all sides to give up their fantasies of power .
The right would have to give up its crazed belief that it can do “ heroic ” things by seizing control of the state , things such as defend or overthrow any government in the world , or things such as make everyone in the country obey their own view of what constitutes the virtuous life .
The left would have to surrender their vision of a state that uses coercion to achieve perfect equality , fairness , and distributive justice throughout the world .
Without a central bank , the political section of the bookstore would have to be reclassified as science fiction .
This is why you hardly ever hear a fundamental question on the right of the Fed to exist .
This is why the political culture frowns on anyone who attacks the heart of the state .
This is why it is so “ unrespectable ” to mention the case against the Fed , and why serious critics are treated to a kind of shunning , and why , if you want to go places in Washington , you must never entertain the idea that the central bank ought to be abolished .
Indeed , you should fte and publish the head of the Fed .
There is a great intellectual cost associated with the central bank .
People today imagine that not having one would be the equivalent of anarchy .
It would be as if we had a state that nationalized the shoe industry and after a time no one could even imagine how private enterprise could make shoes .
Anyone who would suggest that the state dispense with the role would be treated like a crazy person .
But how crazy is it ?
The central bank has failed in its overt mission for nearly 100 years .
It has destroyed our money , funded unjust wars , given rise to a ghastly bureaucratic state , and pumped up more credit bubbles than we can count .
And yet we are supposed to chalk up all of this to miscues and mistakes along the way , and then believe the head of the Fed when he promises to do better next time .
What ’s more , the Fed has never actually accepted real responsibility for any of its misdeeds .
Just who is crazy here ?
If we really believed in authentic science — not the pseudo - science of public policy — we could conclude that this failed central bank has got to go .
Its creation is not a footnote , but a main step in making possible all modern tyranny .
Its abolition is a key to freedom itself .

MOSCOW  Russia will loan Venezuela $ 1 billion for arms purchases and military development , a Kremlin spokesman said Friday , the second day of a visit here by President Hugo Chávez aimed at tightening a relationship that has caused increasing discomfort in the West .
Mr. Chávez , who is on his second visit to Russia in two months , met with Prime Minister Vladimir V. Putin on Thursday , and on Friday traveled to the southern city of Orenburg near the border with Kazakhstan to meet with President Dmitri A. Medvedev .
A Kremlin statement released Thursday night said Mr. Putin and Mr. Chávez had spoken on enhancing economic cooperation and trade in commercial goods as well as military technologies .
The $ 1 billion loan will help finance programs related to military - technical cooperation , the statement said .
The Kremlin spokesman , who spoke anonymously under normal diplomatic ground rules , would not elaborate on the details of the deal .
Pedestrians were shaving precious seconds off their crossing time at Toronto 's first scramble intersection Thursday .
The busy juncture at Yonge and Dundas Streets now gives priority to pedestrians , allowing them to crisscross in any direction , even diagonally , once traffic lights turn red for cars .
Traffic flows normally for two cycles , before stopping in all directions .
Walkers have 31 seconds to cross any which they please .
" It 's awesome , " one pedestrian told CTV Toronto .
" I 'm gonna do this the rest of the day in fact , " another said .
As city councilor Kyle Rae ambled through the intersection , he told CTV Toronto that " it 's a refocusing of priorities to pedestrians . "
It 's a move to improve pedestrian safety , he said .
" Yonge and Dundas is one of the busiest intersections in the city of Toronto , " Rae , whose ward includes the intersection , said in a statement .
" But with the introduction of an exclusive right - of - way for pedestrians , everyone can feel more confident of making it through the intersection safely . "
In general , twice as many pedestrians than cars move through the intersection at any given time .
New York , San Francisco , Miami , Tokyo and Auckland have employed pedestrian right - of - way systems for years .
They are also known as scramble phases or scramble corners , as well as the " Barnes Dance , " so named for Henry Barnes , the American traffic engineer who is credited with first developing the system .
The city will employ traffic assistants on site to help pedestrians acclimatize to the new system .
There are plans to adjust the timing of lights so pedestrians have enough time to cross , and enhance the signals that assist the visually impaired .
The $ 60,000 pilot project is just the beginning , officials say .
If Torontonians take to the stop - light scramble , it may be added to other busy intersections such as Yonge and Bloor Streets , Bay and Bloor Streets and Bay and Dundas Streets .
The new feet - first approach to crossing the street is part of the city 's plan to develop a long - term sustainable transportation strategy for Toronto .
With a report from CTV Toronto's Matet Nebres
SAN FRANCISCO ( MarketWatch ) -- Christopher Cox , chairman of the Securities and Exchange Commission , proposed limits on short selling of shares in Fannie Mae FNM , +0.85 % and Freddie Mac FRE , - 0.64 % on Tuesday , according to CNBC .
A spokesman for the SEC did n't immediately return a phone call seeking comment on Tuesday .
Short selling is a way to bet against securities .
Fannie and Freddie shares have slumped roughly 70 % in the past month .

It ’s awfully early for John McCain to be running such a desperate , ugly campaign against Barack Obama .
But I guess it ’s useful for Democrats to get a reminder that the Republican Party plays presidential politics by the same moral code that guided the bad - boy Oakland Raiders in their heyday : “ Just win , baby . ”
The latest bit of snarling , mean - spirited nonsense to come out of the McCain camp was the accusation , leveled by campaign manager Rick Davis , that Obama had “ played the race card . ”
He did so , apparently , by being black .
On Wednesday , at a campaign stop in Missouri , Obama had predicted that Republicans would try to “ make you scared of me .
You know , ‘ he ’s not patriotic enough , he ’s got a funny name , ’ you know , ‘he does n’t look like all those other presidents on the dollar bills . ’ ” So what does Davis do ?
He promptly tries to make voters scared of Obama by feigning outrage over the presumptive Democratic nominee ’s “ divisive , negative , shameful and wrong ” remarks .
Of course the McCain campaign is n’t really offended that the first black major - party candidate for president in American history might mention this distinction from time to time .
The idea is to slow Obama down before he runs away with this thing , and the weapon of choice is handfuls of mud .
Remember St. John the Reformer , who promised a high - minded campaign and said he would n’t question his opponent ’s patriotism ?
Clearly , he ’s been replaced by an evil twin .
The switch seems to have taken place during his opponent ’s world tour , when Obama ’s prescriptions for Iraq and Afghanistan began to look prescient — and McCain ’s began to look irrelevant .
McCain kept saying that Obama “ does n’t understand ” the war zones — even though the president of Afghanistan , the prime minister of Iraq and even U.S. military officials on the ground seemed to think Obama understood both situations quite well .
McCain then resorted to the outrageous charge that Obama “ would rather lose a war in order to win a political campaign . ”
I think that qualifies as an allegation that Obama is “ not patriotic enough , ” do n’t you ?
Since then , the McCain campaign has sharply escalated its rhetorical attacks — making blatantly false claims , for example , about a canceled visit with injured troops in Germany .
The blitz has been successful in one of its aims , which is to drive the news cycle and thus focus attention on McCain .
Much less clear is whether voters really want to elect Don Rickles as president .
The low point , so far , is McCain ’s bizarre ad that flashes images of Paris Hilton and Britney Spears before showing Obama in Berlin addressing the multitudes .
In what promises to be a major attack theme , the ad derides Obama as “ the biggest celebrity in the world ” — an attempt to turn Obama ’s popularity into some kind of fatal flaw .
In a conference call with reporters Wednesday , Davis and campaign senior adviser Steve Schmidt — a veteran of George W. Bush ’s 2004 campaign — kept returning to the word celebrity in describing Obama .
It ’s a classic attempt to take a positive and turn it into a negative , as was done with John Kerry ’s heroic service in Vietnam by the odious Swift boat campaign .
The McCain campaign ’s excursion into popular culture has been so aggressive that the Obama campaign felt obliged to promptly denounce a new song by Ludacris that criticizes both McCain and Hillary Clinton in crude terms .
Never mind that the rapper has no association with Obama ’s candidacy , and never mind that McCain is probably not intimately familiar with the Ludacris oeuvre .
All this gnashing and flailing would be laughable if it were n’t so purposeful .
The aim is to cast an aura of doubt around Obama — to portray him as handsome and popular but insubstantial , as a “ celebrity ” who ’s not really up to the job .
Oh , and not that we would ever mention such a thing , but did you notice that Obama had the audacity to mention that he ’s African - American ?
The Obama campaign has been quick to respond with new television ads accusing McCain of practicing the “ old politics . ”
Kerry ’s unhappy experience showed that this kind of define - your - opponent blitzkrieg , however ridiculous the attacks may be , has to be answered immediately — and in kind .
Negative campaigning is not a pretty thing , and it should be beneath John McCain to stoop so low .
But Democrats would be foolish to forget that sometimes it works .

Yup , that 's right , after a long wait , the latest xmonad has been released .
If you 're looking for packages , skip to the bottom .
There probably is no real reason why it took so long to be released .
Up until 0.7 , xmonad was facing roughly a 1 - 2 month release cycle with alot of rapid and rabid development in between .
The fundamental changes to xmonad 0.8 since 0.7 are minor , and fall chiefly in the refinement category .
It seems that development to xmonad has become relatively stable .
One of the reasons to push the release was that there was so little development on the core parts to begin with .
So the decision was made , and the release went by really smoothly .
This does not mean that xmonad is starting to die out .
There are two things that make xmonad radically different than many other window managers .
First of all , xmonad is based on some fundamental mathematical principles and data structures common to the functional programming world .
The original goal to produce a functional window manager ( no pun intended , although feel free to interpret one in ; ) ) has essentially taken a year to develop from start to finish .
It also uses some highly testable development methods including unit tests exposed to QuickCheck , the haskell unit tester , that greatly increase stability .
Stable , if slow , development of xmonad implies that after a year of public usage , all the boiler plate code around the window manager has been refined and tested by a large number of users into some elegant minimal code , and by minimal , i mean 1045 significant lines of code style minimal .
The second important component is the contrib library , which is really quite essential to development .
It is another ~9000 SLOC with a number of components to make using xmonad far easier and more flexible .
In the true functional style , they are just a bunch of user submitted functions that different users have found useful for others too .
For example , it includes fancy advanced layouts , layout combinators , alternate syntaxes for window management and key commands , random tools for outputting important information to dzen , or other tools , and for interacting with other parts of the system .
Not a single line of code is actually run unless the user uses it .
The config file itself is actually just a haskell program cleverly disguised as a config file .
In this latest release , there is an add - on in contrib that will even convert other config file formats into a haskell file , compile it , and run it , all in the background .
The only components that are included in the run time are the ones being used .
Of course , as a user , you never need to work with compiling your own xmonad window manager ; part of that 1000 lines of code is the boilerplate to automatically look for your ~/.xmonad / xmonad.hs , compile it , and load it up , without much trouble .
You can even make changes , reload your WM , and that same boilerplate will just pass your session on to the newest version .
I 've built some packages , which are available at my personal repo at :
If you are already using my packages and repo , you should automatically get updates through yum .
These packages are currently for Fedora 9 , i386 only , but if anyone submits some builds for other archs / platforms , i'll be glad to stick them in the repo .
On a side note , I 'm having some trouble signing my packages .
Anyone know how to make sure rpmsign is using the right gpg key to sign packages ?
PALIN ’S UNIQUE SPIN ON THE BAILOUT ….
When Sarah Palin sat down with ABC ’s Charlie Gibson a couple of weeks ago , it was a fairly dominant story .
Palin ’s interview yesterday with CBS ’s Katie Couric is drawing significantly less attention , obviously because it ’s facing tougher competition from other news developments .
And the McCain campaign has to be thrilled , because the truth is , Palin is getting worse at answering questions , not better .
This one has to be seen to be believed .
The question was provocative , but hardly unexpected given recent events .
Couric asked Palin , “ Why is n’t it better , Governor Palin , to spend $ 700 billion helping middle - class families who are struggling with health care , housing , gas and groceries ?
Allow them to spend more , and put more money into the economy , instead of helping these big financial institutions that played a role in creating this mess ? ”
Palin , in a rambling and largely incoherent response , responded , “ That ’s why I say I , like every American I ’m speaking with , were ill about this position that we have been put in .
Where it is the taxpayers looking to bail out .
But ultimately , what the bailout does is help those who are concerned about the health care reform that is needed to help shore up our economy .
Um , helping , oh , it ’s got to be about job creation , too .
Shoring up our economy , and getting it back on the right track .
So health care reform and reducing taxes and reining in spending has got to accompany tax reductions , and tax relief for Americans , and trade — we have got to see trade as opportunity , not as , uh , competitive , um , scary thing , but one in five jobs created in the trade sector today .
We ’ve got to look at that as more opportunity .
All of those things under the umbrella of job creation . ”
I ’m sorry , what ?
Did she even hear the question ?
Worse , if you watch the clip , you might notice that Palin was intermittently referring to notes .
In other words , this is the kind of response she offers on a question about the Wall Street bailout with help .
I just want to reiterate a point from last week .
First - time candidates for national office often struggle to get over the learning curve .
Governors and senators will visit a coffee shop in Iowa City eight months before the caucuses , get confused about a policy detail , but improve as the campaign rolls on .
They take their time , go through extensive briefings , and learn to get good .
By the time the conventions are done , these candidates are supposed to be on the top of their game .
Palin , however , is in a situation where failure is almost impossible to avoid .
She ’s never expressed any knowledge of national or international issues , she ’s never expressed any interest in national or international issues , and she ’s making humiliating mistakes under the glare of the national spotlight , with just six weeks until Election Day .
With some time in government , Palin might become a less embarrassing candidate .
But at this point , it ’s almost unfair for McCain to set her up for this kind of fiasco .
ソーシャルニュースサイトとして急速に成長を遂げたDiggだが、最近では問題が目立ってきた。Diggのみならず、他のいわゆるWeb 2.0なコミュニティサイトにも共通する問題かもしれない。
あるサイトにどれくらいトラフィックがあるのか知りたいとき、まず名が挙がるサービスはAlexaだろう。しかし、Alexaはデータ取得のやり方に問題があって、正直ほとんどあてにはならない。これは、すでにその筋の間ではコンセンサスになっていると思う(たとえばTechCrunchの記事)。ちなみに本家SlashdotのボスCmdrTacoもAlexaのいい加減さにキレていた。今年に入って少しは手法を改善したらしいが、それはそれで副作用が出ているようである。やはり、サイトごとに直接JavaScriptを埋め込んで集計するようなタイプのサービスでないと、まともな結果は出ないのだろう。
そう言った意味で私がこのところ参考にしているのは、埋め込み集計型でそこそこ多くのサイトから協力を得ているQuantcastだが、このサービスでソーシャルニュースサイトの雄Diggのデータを見るとなかなかおもしろい。DiggはQuantcastに協力し、サイトにJavaScriptを埋め込んでいるのでそれなりにちゃんとした結果が出ているはずなのだが、それを見るとトラフィック( Monthly People ) が、特にアメリカ国内では明らかに横ばい、頭打ちになってきているのだ(Diggの場合、アメリカ国内からのアクセスが約7割を占める)。このところDiggは技術系のネタだけではなく政治やスポーツなど他の分野も大いにカバーするようになっていた(ReadWriteWebの記事に出ているグラフを見るとある意味衝撃的である)ので、増えたのかと思ったらそうでもないらしい。
私自身が気づいていたのはここまでだったが、GigaOMのOm Malikはもう少し突っ込んだことを書いている。彼が注目したのはQuantcastのデータのTraffic Frequencyだ。これを見ると、わずか1%のユーザ( Addicts )が、なんとサイト全体のPVの33%、3割以上を叩き出しているということが分かる。また、最近Diggの運営側は100人以上のユーザを出入り禁止にし、数日後にはさらに58人が同様の運命をたどったのだが、その理由は「スクリプトの使用による規約違反」だそうだ。これは、自動的に投票するスクリプトを使って記事の順位を不正に上げ下げしていたということだろう(Diggでは、ユーザによる投票の結果次第で記事が目立つトップページに出たり、出なかったりする)。この200人弱が、先ほど出てきた「1%のユーザ」の、少なくとも一部は構成していたのではないかと私は思う。こうした傾向は今に始まったことではなく、すでに2006年の時点で、トップページに出る記事のうち過半数の56%は100人の特定ユーザから投稿されていること、さらにそのうち25%はわずか20人のユーザから投稿されていることが指摘されていた( SEOmozの記事 ) 。
これらの事実から言えそうなことは2点ある。まず一つは、Diggのネット上でのプレゼンスというのは、もともとだいぶ水増しされていたのではないか、ということだ。見た目上のPVの数%にしか現実にはリーチしていない(しかもそれはbotかもしれない)となれば、ビジネスモデルとして広告モデルを考えているところには致命傷となろう。Googleが最後の最後で買収に尻込みしたのも、チームの性格が合わないだのなんだのではなく、実はこのへんの事情に気づいたのが原因になっていたのではないかと想像する。
それよりも重要だと思われるのは、Diggのコンテンツが、一般的なイメージと異なり、実際にはごく少数のユーザによって半ば恣意的にコントロールされていたのではないか、ということだ。Diggは2004年の登場以来、記事の投稿から評価まですべてユーザに委ねられた真に「民主的な」メディアを自任し、それゆえにWeb 2.0の旗手としてもてはやされてきた。それだけに、これは重大な問題なのではないかと思う。
実のところ私は、メディアが民主的であればあるほど、ある種の情報操作に脆弱なのではないかと考えている。「群衆の叡智」と言ったところで、実情はごく少数の意見がストレートに大きく投影された影絵のようなものでしかない可能性があるわけだ。むしろ、なまじ「『みんなの意見』は案外正しい」などと素直に思い込んでいると、誰かの仕込みに容易にひっかかってしまいそうである。こうした陥穽を、どこまで技術的な工夫で避けられるかが、今後ソーシャルニュースサイトを設計運営する上で大きな課題となると考えられる。
A priest has resigned from his parish after being caught viewing web porn in his computer at work .
While I 'm sure God does n't give a damn about porn - no matter how close it is to heaven - or the weaknesses of this priest , the church 's IT staff and the archbishop were n't so amused when they discovered that his porn surfing antics had infected all the computers in the parish network .
The parish padre , from the town of Strängnas , Sweden - my favorite country in the world - admitted his actions , saying that it was true he spent " a lot of time at work viewing pornographic websites " and he wished his lust would have remained between himself and God instead of infecting the computers with this " lethal computer virus " .
Well , Mr. Svenssonjohanssoncommandersson , seriously , do n't flagellate yourself over a computer virus .
This kind of things happens to the best , although archbishop Anders Wejryd is not so understanding as we are :
Priests are people too , but I have no understanding at all for someone sitting and surfing for porn on the parish computers .

Well , archbishop , better watching porn than touching little kids like some of your colleagues elsewhere in the world , that 's for sure .
Apparently , however , some definitive action was needed with the Strängnas priest after another pastor in my beloved Göteborg " came under scrutiny for moistening post - it notes with his penis and sticking them up in an office . "
Inexplicably , this one was allowed to keep his job .
And yes , we need video of that .
[ The Register ]
Fox News tough guy Sean Hannity assured us this week he would press Sarah Palin for real answers -- no going easy on the woman who could be the next vice president of the United States .
“ No topic , ” Hannity intoned , “ is off limits . ”
A couple of nights earlier , Fox ’s hard - talking lawyer , Greta Van Susteren , promised to take us to unknown places in her exclusive interview with Alaska ’s so - called First Dude , Todd Palin .
“ You will see this , ” Greta declared , “ nowhere else ! ”
No , you wo n’t .
And mercifully so .
Because Hannity and Van Susteren produced three nights of infotainment so frothy , slanted and off - point that they challenged even their cable network ’s low standards .
Fox boss man Roger Ailes would desperately like to have his stepchild accepted into the family of respected news sources .
And the reporters who deliver many of Fox ’s reports have been known to battle their employer ’s partisan biases .
But given a chance to
address real issues , and possibly even make news in two encounters with America ’s most intriguing couple , Fox instead condescended to
both Palins , with Van Susteren ’s cringe - worthy paean to Arctic beauty and Todd Palin ’s machismo , and Hannity ’s weak - kneed idolization of Alaska ’s governor .
First , let ’s look at the two sessions on “ Hannity & Colmes , ” where the host had the responsibility of interviewing a politician who aspires to help lead the nation and who is likely to subject herself to few unscripted moments between now and election day .
Sinking to the occasion , Hannity lobbed softball questions , led his pliant subject to safe responses and not so subtly sprinkled his queries with barbs aimed at Barack Obama .
He left the questions many Americans have about Palin ’s record to the end , then signaled that the “ so - called controversies ” were n’t worthy of serious consideration .
At one point Hannity rhapsodized about Alaska ’s low taxes and actually added : “ I have to move to Alaska . ”
I had n’t felt so queasy since the women of ABC ’s “ The View ” wriggled in their seats and giggled gleefully as Obama visited last spring .
Barbara Walters praised the young prince for his “ passion , charisma and call for change , ” not to mention his “ very sexy ” looks .
But at least “ The View ” ladies allowed Elisabeth Hasselbeck to pepper Obama with questions about his controversial former pastor , the Rev. Jeremiah A. Wright Jr .
And that was daytime TV .
Newsman Hannity would countenance no such unpleasantness this week during his precious hour .
He smiled dreamily at Palin and said he wished he had more time .
And the Republican governor -- hair down , smiling , relaxed -- clearly knew she was playing on her home court .
The Fox commentator wasted no time in priming the partisan pump -- suggesting that Obama ’s recent statements on the economy were for “ political gain ” and that his call for higher taxes on the rich amounted to “ class warfare . ”
If Fox had intended a probing interview , it would n’t have assigned one of its most contentious mouthpieces .
Would n’t Brit Hume have asked Palin to clarify , for example , her inane assertion that the ability to see Russia from her state ’s far western shore somehow helped her understand that country ?
How about pressing the governor when ( like Obama ) she ducked a straightforward question about whether insurance giant AIG should receive a government bailout ?
Where was Hannity ’s incredulity when Palin lapsed into amnesia , again , when asked about her initial support of the “ bridge to nowhere ” ?
If I had been thinking clearly , I would have known this interview would have nothing to do with journalism and everything to do with buttressing the Fox brand .
Much as John McCain secured his conservative “ base ” by choosing Sarah Barracuda in the first place , Fox played to its most loyal fans by leaving uncontested the view of Palin as a charming and accomplished everywoman .
Van Susteren made that strategy even more apparent during her embarrassing interview with Palin ’s husband , in which she seemed to morph into a cheerleader .
Go Wasilla High Warriors !
Go Todd !
Todd , do n’t you know , helped build his own home !
Flies his own float plane !
Fishes for sockeye !
Drives his snow machine 112 miles an hour !
Palin somehow maintained his composure and dignity in the face of this frenetic new fan .
At one point , perhaps trying to gently guide his interviewer toward a substantive question , he noted that he had worked to improve Alaska ’s vocational training programs .
But Van Susteren , determined to treat her subject as Klondike Jack , ignored that segue into actual public policy .
She sighed about the spectacular view from Todd ’s doorstep lake .
“ They love you here !
They love you here ! ”
Van Susteren fairly squealed , as the First Dude smiled sheepishly .
“ So that must be fun for you ! ”
Never mind asking Palin about his role in “ Troopergate , ” the investigation into whether his wife tried to use her high office to have her ex-brother - in - law , a state trooper , fired .
Never mind asking Palin whether his First Dudeliness , who appears to have involved himself deeply in some Alaska policy matters , might play a similar role on , say , national security issues , if his wife is sent to Washington .
Going to a final station break , it seemed as if Van Susteren was not promoting her next segment , but announcing a Palin skit on “ Saturday Night Live . ”
“ Coming up , ” Van Susteren trumpeted , " . . . you will hear why the Palins ’ freezer is sometimes packed with moose and caribou !
“ How does it taste ?
Todd will tell you ! ”

These days , if you miss even one payment on your credit card , you could be receiving a call from your bank instead of a letter .
That is because more and more people are now defaulting on their credit card debt .
A recent article in the Wall Street Journal stated that 4.5 percent of bank credit card accounts are now delinquent .
Banks are so anxious to see balances paid down that some are offering payment incentives .
Citibank has been contacting some of its credit card holders and offering to match a percentage of the payments made over the minimum amount due if the cardholder agrees to pay off a percentage of their balances quickly .
There is a cap on the match ( $ 550 ) and the cardholder usually has to agree to at least temporarily stop using their card .
Another bank has realized that cardholders are using caller ID and answering machines to avoid collection calls so they are mailing phone and gift cards to late payers to get them to call back .
The trick is that the gift cards are not activated until the account holder contacts the lender .
The point is that if you are struggling with credit card debt , you should contact the bank as soon as you can .
Companies are definitely trying harder to work deals that will work for you .
Some will offer temporarily lower payments until you catch up on your debt .
At the end of the day , the credit card companies want the debt paid off just as quickly as you do .
Consumer product companies love finding a memorable corporate mascot who can get the buying public to open their wallets .
A great mascot builds brand equity for decades , while a bad one can be an embarrassing smear on a company 's history .
Both types often meet the same fate , though , when it comes time for forced retirement .
Here are a few of our favorites , some still mourned , some still mocked .
The Frito Bandito
As a general rule , if your product is delicious enough to inspire men to commit larceny , it 's probably worth buying .
This logic pervades ad character lore from the bumbling Trix Rabbit to McDonald 's beloved Grimace , who was originally a shake - stealing kleptomaniac before becoming an inarticulate gumdrop .
The Frito Bandito fit into this mold , but he one - upped the others by having a serious pedigree .
Introduced in 1967 , the Frito Bandito sprang from the pen of Tex Avery and received his voice from Mel Blanc ; this team is much more famous for teaming up to create such characters as Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck .
Unfortunately , the Bandito was a bit more offensive than anything from those beloved cartoons .
The character pretty much embodied every negative stereotype he could find .
The Bandito was heavily armed .
He wore a garishly oversized sombrero .
He spoke in an accent that made Speedy Gonzales ' sound reasonable .
He stole and conned his way into delectable corn chips .
He led around a burro .
Early versions of the character even had a gold front tooth and unkempt hair .
The National Mexican - American Anti-Defamation Committee was not amused by this astoundingly racist creation and convinced the chipmaker to clean up the character 's image , including whiting over the gold tooth .
According to a piece in Slate , the Bandito permanently holstered his guns after the RFK assassination , but even that could n't save him .
The Bandito eventually found himself in retirement following a 1971 House subcommittee hearing on ethnic defamation in broadcast media .
Golly
The Golliwogg or Golliwog is a fictional children 's book character created by Florence Kate Upton in the late 19th century ; she described the character as a " horrid sight , the blackest gnome . " 
The character was an obvious offshoot of blackface minstrel iconography , which made sense since it was supposedly inspired by a minstrel doll Upton owned as a child .
To the modern viewer , such a character looks like the product of the worst sort of racist tradition .
When British jam manufacturer John Robertson saw Golly in 1910 , though , he had a rather different reaction , which probably sounded like , " That obvious racial caricature would make a fine mascot for a line of jams ! " 
Golly started appearing on Robertson 's marmalade and jam jars in that year , and the company later distributed buttons with the character 's likeness on it .
The promotion was wildly successful , and collecting Golly buttons became a popular hobby .
Eventually , though , Golly eased into retirement in 2001 .
Was this finally a victory for sensitivity ?
Hardly .
Robertson 's spokespeople told the BBC that the discontinuation had nothing to do with Golly being offensive ; he simply was no longer popular .
Characters from Roald Dahl 's books took his place on the company 's jars .
The Noid
Calling the Noid a corporate mascot is something of a misnomer .
He was really more of a spokesvillain who appeared in Domino 's Pizza ads throughout the 1980s .
While other mascots have at least relatively well - defined motives ( generally theft and / or protection of their Lucky Charms ) , the Noid was a pizza - smashing kindred spirit ( and possibly inspiration for ) Cormac McCarthy 's Anton Chigurh .
Viewers and victims could n't deconstruct or analyze the Noid 's motivations ; he was little more than a vacant and implacable destructive force who only lived to ruin pizzas .
That was the bit in its entirety : a guy in a red suit with floppy rabbit ears who wanted to damage your pizza , possibly by throwing a cartoon bomb into the box .
Only Domino 's could " avoid the Noid "  and deliver a suitable pie to your house .
The Noid was so wildly popular that he inspired two video games : a PC adventure called " Avoid the Noid "  in 1989 and 1990's NES romp " Yo! Noid . " 
CBS told the New York Times it was developing a Noid cartoon series for its 1988 Saturday - morning schedule .
Others were n't quite as keen on the little red guy .
In 1989 , Kenneth Noid walked into a Domino 's in Chamblee , Georgia , and used a .357 magnum to take two employees hostage .
He demanded $ 10,000 , a getaway car , and a copy of the 1985 novel The Widow 's Son ; he ended up getting little more than a Noid- avoiding Domino 's pie and a ride in a squad car .
Speedy Alka- Seltzer
Throughout its history , Alka - Seltzer has marketed itself as a cure for all sorts of ailments , from heartburn to aches and pains to headaches .
It has always maintained a strong marketing presence , and the brand 's most iconic character sprang into existence in 1951 when Speedy Alka - Seltzer was born .
Speedy was a a small , mischievous - looking scamp who had an Alka - Seltzer tablet for a body , a magic " effervescent "  wand , and another Alka - Seltzer for a hat .
( For those of you paying attention , yes , within the internal logic of Speedy 's world , he was basically wearing a torso for a hat . )
According to Alka - Seltzer 's website , the character reflected Bayer 's promotional theme of " Speedy Relief , "  and by 1953 Speedy was appearing in television commercials .
Speedy retired in 1964 after singing and shilling in over 200 TV spots .
While many viewers undoubtedly wished that the boy with an Alka - Seltzer tablet chest had simply effervesced into nothingness during an ill - fated attempt at taking a bath , the character resurfaced from time to time in the following decades .
The Smash Martians
If Martian robots visited Earth , what do you think they'd be interested in ?
Our ecology ?
Our technology ?
According to a 1974 ad for Cadbury 's Smash brand of instant mashed potatoes , the aliens are really only interested in using their soulless robotic voices to mock our methods of potato consumption .
Here we are , a race full of foolish earthlings who primitively peel our potatoes with knives before mashing them ourselves .
These Martians know that only school cafeterias have it right : instant mashed potatoes are the way of the truly enlightened .
If they had thumbs instead of metallic robo - pinchers , these aliens would be thumbing them at our entire planet .
Viewers loved the spots , though , and the Martians made several more appearances .
Although the Martians are n't still around , this ad was spectacularly popular in the U.K .
It won a 1999 poll conducted by the British advertising magazine Campaign to pick the top ad of the century and topped a similar BBC poll in 2006 .
They 've also enjoyed several revivals since their first retirement , including ones in 1992 and 1999 .
For all their popularity , though , the joke 's on the Martians ; everyone knows instant mashed potatoes taste like powdered drywall .
If you think about it , “ manure ” is really not that bad a word .
I mean , it ’s “ newer , ” which is good , and a “ ma ” in front of it , which is also good - “ ma - newer . ” – George Costanza ( 1990 )
In what is either another sign that the McCain camp is angling for more distance from George W. Bush or that strategists are trying to reframe the nuclear issue in a more positive light , speechwriters for Alaska Governor Sarah Palin inserted the phonetically modified neologism , “ new - clear , ” in place of the word “ nuclear , ” at the vice - presidential nominee ’s acceptance speech on Wednesday night .
I should also mention that Ms. Palin ’s speech was written by one of President George W. Bush ’s speechwriters , Matthew Scully .
Perhaps Mr. Scully was so accustomed to writing for the President – whose pronunciation of the word “ nuke - u- lar ” has become stuff of legend – that he forgot to ‘ smarten it back up ’ for a person who can pronounce such tricky words .[ social_buttons ]

In a piece about the words Gov. Palin did not say in Wednesday night ’s speech , Michael Kraskin at Indecision 2008 points out that the original text the of the speech the RNC released to the media still contained the phonetic spelling .
“ Our opponents say , again and again , that drilling will not solve all of America ’s energy problems – as if we all did n’t know that already .
But the fact that drilling wo n’t solve every problem is no excuse to do nothing at all .
Starting in January , in a McCain - Palin administration , we ’re going to lay more pipelines … build more new - clear plants … create jobs with clean coal … and move forward on solar , wind , geothermal , and other alternative sources . ”
The text of Palin ’s speech has now been cleaned - up at the GOP 2008 Convention Portal , to represent what the words in the speech actually intended , not the Bush - friendly phonetically - remastered ones .

Marijuana : Decriminalization Measure Moving in Massachusetts
2/16/06
http://stopthedrugwar.org/chronicle/423/massdecrim.shtml
A bill that would impose fines -- not jail time -- for simple marijuana possession in Massachusetts has been approved by the General Court 's Joint Mental Health and Substance Abuse Committee , the first step in a lengthy legislative process that could see the Bay State finally joining the ranks of states that have decided jailing pot-smokers is not worth it .
Simple possession is currently considered a criminal offense punishable by up to six months in jail and a $ 500 fine .
Senate Bill 1151 , sponsored by state Sen. Charles Shannon , would impose a $ 250 civil fine on adults in possession of less than an ounce of weed without the possibility of a jail sentence .
The parents or guardians of juveniles caught in possession would be notified and the citation would be delivered directly to them .
Marijuana has already been decriminalized in 11 other states .
Most of those laws were passed in the 1970s , but for Massachusetts lawmakers it is a case of better late than never .
In a 2002 study , Harvard economist Dr. Jeffrey Miron estimated that decriminalizing marijuana in the state would save taxpayers $ 24.3 million in arrest and booking costs alone .
He did not factor in revenues generated by a system of fines .
" The committee is reflecting the attitude of the majority of Bay Staters -- that personal possession of marijuana should not lead to a criminal record that will damage the rest of someone 's life , " said committee chair Rep. Ruth Balser ( D - Newton ) .
" It is the goal of the Mental Health & Substance Abuse Committee to have drug abuse seen in a treatment context , not a criminal justice context . "
" We must be realistic about the differences between various illicit substances and the dangers they present to our communities , " said Committee Chairman Senator Steven Tolman ( D - Boston ) .
" It is time the legislature had an honest debate on marijuana and our criminal justice system and I look forward to participating in that debate . "
" It is wonderful to see Massachusetts legislators taking this step toward a sensible debate on marijuana control policies , " said Whitney A. Taylor , Executive Director of the Drug Policy Forum of Massachusetts .
" We are moving away from policies based on stigma and punishment , to those based on science , efficacy and human dignity . "
While there are still legislative hurdles to overcome , the committee vote is a significant milestone , Taylor said .
" This is the first time in over a decade that a Massachusetts legislative committee has voted in favor of civil fines for marijuana possession , " she noted .
Elinor Carucci
in the evening on November 5 , 1999 , Erik Ramsey punched out of his after - school job at Arby 's and went to seewith a friend .
They were driving home on a two - lane highway in Duluth , Georgia , a suburb about twenty - five miles northeast of Atlanta , when a minivan tried to make a U - turn from the oncoming lane .
Erik 's friend was speeding , and they never saw the other vehicle 's headlights .
The collision sent the minivan 's engine flying out of its chassis .
The car Erik was in , a late - model Camaro , careened into a curb and flipped end over end before landing upside down in a grove of small pine trees .
The driver escaped with a chunk of metal embedded in his skull .
Firefighters had to use the Jaws of Life to extract Erik .
He was sixteen .
When Erik 's father , Eddie , arrived at the Gwinnett Medical Center , he found his son lying on a table in the emergency room , screaming and writhing in pain .
His first thought was simply , This is bad .
Real bad .
Erik 's leg was dangling at a right angle from his torso .
His head was perforated like a pincushion with pine straw .
His spleen had been lacerated , his diaphragm had ruptured , and his left lung had collapsed .
He was n't yet under anesthesia , so the doctor asked Eddie to help keep his son pinned to the table .
Even as he gasped for air , Erik 's six - foot , 180 - pound frame managed to rip free from his father 's grasp .
For the next three weeks , Erik lay in the intensive - care unit , awake but unresponsive .
Once his condition stabilized , a neurologist finally gave Eddie and his wife , Sandra , the diagnosis .
A blood clot had formed in a part of their son's brain stem called the pons , causing a stroke right at the juncture where his body met his mind .
Erik was suffering from an extremely rare and permanent condition known as locked - in syndrome .
" Bottom line is that he has no control over any of his muscles , " the doctor told them .
" He 'll never move and he 'll never speak . "
Otherwise , the accident had spared virtually all of Erik 's conscious and unconscious processing systems .
His memory , his reason , and his emotions were all intact .
He could see and hear and feel -- and feel pain -- but he would never again have any way of communicating .
Eddie walked into Erik 's hospital room and looked at his son .
Erik 's eyes were wide open .
He stared straight back at his father .
The only muscles over which Erik still had any voluntary command were the ones that control the up - and - down movement of his eyes .
Unlike Jean - Dominique Bauby , the locked - in author of The Diving Bell and the Butterfly , Erik could n't blink .
Even moving his eyes left and right was beyond his capability .
However , very soon after the accident , a speech therapist discovered that there remained one peephole in the otherwise impenetrable wall that kept Erik sequestered in his cell of flesh and bones .
Because he could still look up and down , he could still say yes and no .
" Up for heaven , down for hell , " the therapist told him .
" Erik , are you deaf ? "
That was the first question Eddie asked him , because until then no one was sure .
Erik looked down .
" So you must be tired of people yelling at you ? "
He looked up and opened his eyes emphatically .
That was nine years ago .
The Office of Neural Signals , Inc , . is located in a single - story yellow clapboard building in a professional park in Duluth , only a few miles from the Ramseys ' home .
Three engraved patents hang on a wall near the door , including US 7275035 B2 , " System and Method for Speech Generation from Brain Activity , " granted September 25 , 2007 , to Dr. Philip Kennedy , a pioneer in the field of brain - computer interface ( BCI ) research .
On the opposite wall there is a small poster that reads :
WHO BENEFITS ?
TODAY : ALS , Brain Stem Stroke , Other Locked - In Patients
TOMORROW : Spinal Cord Injured , Cyborgs , Enhancement of
Normal Humans
In the largest room of the dark , cluttered office , tables are stacked with computer monitors and electronics equipment , and a web of cables drapes between dislodged ceiling tiles .
In the center of the room , Erik Ramsey is sitting in his wheelchair , wearing a blue sweat suit and slippers , with a bundle of wires coming out the back of his head .
He 's staring at a wall onto which Kennedy has projected a matrix of six words : heat , hid , hat , hut , hoot , and hot .
They represent each of the major English vowel sounds .
Kennedy , tall and stately at sixty , asks Erik to think about making the sound uh - ee .
As he does , a green cursor jitters across the wall from hut to heat , and a booming vibrato pours out of the speaker : " uuuhahuuuuhaheeeeeeee . "
The sound is coming straight from Erik 's brain .
Kennedy is trying to help Erik become the first human being ever to have his thoughts translated directly into speech .
In November 2004 , Kennedy 's team put Erik into an fMRI scanner and showed him images of animals .
While the scanner monitored Erik 's brain activity , Kennedy asked him to say the name of each animal in his head : " This is a lion .
This is an elephant . "
The fMRI produced a map guiding them to the precise area of Erik 's brain that was activated when he tried to speak , a region of the premotor cortex that controls movement of the mouth , lips , tongue , and jaw .
A few weeks later , neurosurgeons working with Kennedy opened Erik 's skull and threaded a tiny glass cone containing three long , hair - thin Teflon - coated gold wires into exactly that part of his brain .
Within a few months , Kennedy had Erik producing short words like dada and mama , but the model he was using to interpret the brain signals was too simple ever to decipher real speech .
When Kennedy further analyzed the signals , he discovered that he could detect thirty - two of thirty - nine English phonemes , or basic sound units , in the electrode 's output .
In 2006 , Frank Guenther , a computational neuroscientist at Boston University , joined the project .
An expert in the brain 's speech systems , Guenther helped Kennedy develop a computer decoder that could turn those patterns into a prosthetic voice .
Elinor Carucci
" Now , Erik , we 're going to play another sound for you , " says Kennedy .
He 's sitting next to Erik , a hand on his forearm .
" This time I want you to think about the sound uh - ih . "
The computer produces the noise that Erik is supposed to make , then there 's a quick beep .
Erik is now in control of the voice coming out of the speaker .
He 's sitting perfectly still , but the green cursor leaps from hut to hoot to hat to hit as he tries to steady the vibrating sound with his thoughts .
The speaker beeps again .
" All right Erik , you almost got it that time , " says Kennedy , whose subtle Irish accent hints at his Limerick childhood .
" Let 's try it again . "
When Erik thinks about puckering his mouth into an o or stretching his lips into an e , a unique pattern of neurons fires -- even though his body does n't respond .
It 's like flicking switches that connect to a burned - out bulb .
The electrode implant picks up the noisy firing signals of about fifty different neurons , amplifies them , and transmits them across Erik 's skull to two small receivers glued to shaved spots on the crown of his head .
Those receivers then feed the signal into a computer , which uses a sophisticated algorithm to compare the pattern of neural firings to a library of patterns Kennedy recorded earlier .
It takes about fifty milliseconds for the computer to figure out what Erik is trying to say and translate those thoughts into sound .
This is the hardest work Erik does all week , and after three hours he 's fading .
Despite the dissolved Provigil capsule that he ingested through his feeding tube at the beginning of the session , his eyes are starting to close .
Kennedy promises him that if he can do one more round of testing , he 'll play the Headbangers Ball CD , one of Erik 's favorites .
This seems to reenergize him .
He tries uh - ih again , and this time guides the cursor precisely from hut to hit .
The deep Southern drawl that fills the room is actually a digitized sampling of Eddie 's voice .
( Kennedy and Guenther figured it was as close as they'd be able to get to Erik 's own . )
Nobody would ever mistake these simple vowel sounds for language , but they 're just the first steps .
This fall , a new decoder that Guenther is developing will allow Erik to form consonants as well .
The goal : full sentences within five years .
Locked - In Syndrome was only identified as a medical condition in the sixties .
It can develop in two ways : either gradually , as the result of a degenerative disease like ALS , or suddenly , as the result of a stroke or trauma .
No American organization keeps statistics about how many people are locked - in , but there are probably no more than several thousand patients each year in the United States who survive the kind of brain - stem stroke that crippled Erik .
Almost 90 percent of them die within four months , though a few manage to hang on for years , even decades .
Hard as it is to call Erik lucky , he was fortunate that the doctors recognized his condition so quickly .
There are stories of people being locked - in for years before anyone notices the fully conscious person hiding inside the paralyzed body .
In 1966 , a thirty - two - year - old woman named Julia Tavalaro became locked - in after a brain hemorrhage and was sent to Goldwater Memorial Hospital on Roosevelt Island , New York , where the staff took to calling her " the vegetable . "
It was n't until six years later that a family member noticed Tavalaro trying to smile after she heard a dirty joke .
She was immediately taught to communicate with eye blinks and became a poet and author .
She died in 2003 at the age of sixty - eight , having never spoken for thirty - seven years .
After Erik 's accident , he stayed in the hospital for more than a month .
At first he had so many visitors that they could n't all crowd into his hospital room at once .
Eddie remembers one girl in particular with dyed - blue hair who cried and cried when she visited Erik , then never came back .
In the hospital , the doctors advised Eddie and Sandra that there was no way the family would be able to provide Erik with the 24/7 care he needed at home .
They all suggested that the best thing they could do would be to put him in a good nursing home and visit often .
That Thanksgiving , November 25 , 1999 , was the first without Erik .
In fact , it was pretty much the first time in the three weeks since the accident that Eddie had been home for any longer than to shower or pick up fresh clothes .
It was rainy that day , " dreary and miserable , " Eddie recalls , and when he looked across the table at Erik 's empty chair and down at his plate of instant mashed potatoes , he finally crumpled under the weight of everything he'd been trying to carry .
" I just could n't handle it anymore , and I hated that I was n't strong for my family , " he says .
" Somehow , and I can't explain it , I gained strength from that event and that day .
I realized I had to take control of what would be the future for our household . "
The family decided that even if it meant reorienting their entire lives around Erik 's care , they were n't going to stick him in some nursing home .
While Erik was still in rehab , friends of the family pitched in to remodel the Ramseys ' twelve - hundred - square - foot split - level house to accommodate Erik 's wheelchair .
They ripped out the flooring of the den , which was to become Erik 's bedroom , and replaced it with linoleum tiles , knowing there 'd be lots of mopping .
They put a futon in the den for Erik 's younger brother , Matthew , now a Kia mechanic , to sleep on .
Someone would always have to be there in case anything were to happen in the middle of the night .
In time , the family settled into a schedule .
Erik is fed four times a day through a feeding tube that empties directly into his stomach .
Almost every meal for the last nine years has consisted of two cans of a soupy brown liquid called Compleat whose main ingredients are ground vegetables and chicken stock .
Twice a week , he is given a rectal - suppository laxative to clean his bowels .
He urinates through a catheter into a bag that has to be emptied every five to six hours .
Twice a day , a vibrating black vest is wrapped around his chest to help clear lung congestion .
Every hour , his muscles have to be stretched to prevent uncomfortable cramps , and twice a day he is put through an hour of range - of - motion exercises to keep his muscles from atrophying .
Because Erik 's tear ducts no longer function , someone has to remember to put saline drops in his eyes every ninety minutes , lest they begin to feel like sandpaper .
And because he has no way of expressing pain or discomfort , all this care must be administered as gingerly as if he were a newborn .
When Erik 's fingernails have to be trimmed , Eddie uses his teeth .
When Kennedy began putting brain implants into lab animals in the mid-eighties , many of his colleagues were skeptical .
" When I was starting out , it was very hard to persuade people that this would work , " he says , sitting behind a desk in his small office at Neural Signals .
" In the beginning , we could n't get any funding . "
Nothing about the underlying technology Kennedy was using was new -- neuroscientists had been wiretapping the brain since the fifties -- but what he was proposing seemed just a little too simple to work .
Nobody believed you could get enough useful data out of a single electrode to control even the simplest computer program , much less a prosthetic voice .
" I presented at a major neuroscience conference , and nobody could see it except the students , " he says .
For all the advances that have been made in brain science in recent decades , scientists are still relatively clueless about what transpires in the neural circuitry of the human cortex , the wrinkled and remarkably homogeneous outer layer of the brain that allows us to plan for the future , do long division , write poetry , and -- in Erik 's case -- speak through a computer .
One of Kennedy 's early insights was that you do n't necessarily have to understand all the intricacies of the brain in order to communicate with it .
Even though Kennedy has no way of knowing specifically which fifty neurons are being recorded by Erik 's implant , he knows he's in the right region of the brain .
All the implant has to do is gather enough signals ; the pattern - recognition software takes care of the rest .
In 1986 , while running a lab at Georgia Tech 's Biomedical Engineering Center , Kennedy implanted his first rat , followed by a monkey six years later .
Four years after that , in 1996 , he became the first scientist to receive FDA approval to implant a BCI in a locked - in human .
The subject , an ALS patient named Marjorie , died just seventy - six days after receiving her implant , but in that short period she learned to control a simple binary switch with her brain .
It was enough for her to say yes and no , and sufficient proof of concept for Kennedy to move ahead with a second locked - in ALS patient named Johnnie Ray , who used his implant to control a mouse cursor and spell out short words .
At one point Kennedy asked him what it felt like to operate a computer with his brain .
He typed out , " NOTHING . "
After Johnnie Ray , the press began to notice Kennedy 's work , and so did other scientists .
In 2004 , a company called Cyberkinetics , led by the Brown University neuroscientist John Donoghue , received the second ( and only other ) FDA approval to implant BCIs in human subjects .
Donoghue 's first patient , a twenty - four - year - old quadriplegic named Matthew Nagle , became so adept at steering a computer with his thoughts that he was able to draw circles on the screen and even play Pong .
Miguel Nicolelis , at Duke , and John Chapin , at the State University of New York Downstate Medical Center , have trained monkeys to use an implant that controls a robotic arm .
Just to show they could , they transmitted a monkey 's brain signals over the Internet to a robotic arm six hundred miles away .
In December 1999 , shortly after the discovery that Erik could still communicate with his eyes , Eddie printed up a chart with the letters of the alphabet on it , divided into five rows and six columns .
The family would read through the chart until Erik indicated he'd found the letter he was looking for , by pushing his eyes upward .
For the first time since the accident , he could express himself , however haltingly .
One of the first questions he asked his mother was , " Why is it taking so long ? "
Erik was n't a particularly loquacious or introspective guy before the accident , and though it 's impossible to imagine that his condition has n't given him an entirely new perspective on life , he never made much of an attempt to express it with the letter chart .
Most of the words he spelled out with his eyeballs were for the sake of naming movies he wanted to watch -- Erik may be the world 's single most prolific Netflix renter , averaging six to eight films a day -- or CDs he wanted to listen to .
Listening to music and watching movies are practically the only leisure pursuits he can enjoy on the same plane as the rest of us , although optical - nerve damage from the accident means he has to watch on a seventy - two - inch television .
Still , he 's often forced to sit through shows he'd rather skip .
One evening , as he was sitting next to his mother watching 60 Minutes , he grabbed her attention with a guttural grunt , a sound he can make only with enormous effort .
She brought over the letter board and he took several minutes to spell out a question : " Why do you watch such crappy shows ? "
Elinor Carucci
" That was classic Erik , " says Sandra , a cheery woman of Philippine descent .
She and I are sitting with Erik late one evening in May in the sunken den of their home .
She 's wearing a black pantsuit and a pink jacket with a cross pinned to her lapel .
She pulls out a box of pictures from before the accident .
There 's Erik in front of Stone Mountain , a husky kid with an oversized T - shirt down to his knees .
There he is shoving his little brother .
There he is drinking a Coke at the 1996 Olympics .
" Erik was very mild - mannered , " she says , then catches herself .
" He is very mild - mannered . "
He 's sitting next to us , but we talk about him as if he were n't .
Erik loves heavy metal , especially Slipknot and Ozzy Osbourne , and he used to love moshing .
He skateboarded wherever he could , especially in places where skateboarding was prohibited .
He 'd often sneak out at night and come back early the next morning .
His family called him the pied piper because of the way his younger cousins followed him around everywhere .
He used to tell people he wanted to be an animator when he grew up .
He drew everywhere and on everything .
In the first years after the accident , Sandra used to think everything might turn out all right if Erik could only get back the use of his drawing hand .
Erik seems absorbed in the film he 's watching ( Sydney White , the Amanda Bynes movie about a group of misfit coeds pledging a sorority ) , so Sandra and I move into the small kitchen overlooking the den , where we talk about him in hushed tones .
" I think that he finally accepted that he has no control , " Sandra tells me .
" We used to ask him if it was okay if we watch this or that on the television and he would actually say no .
He does n't anymore .
We used to ask if we could sleep in his bed and he would say no .
Now he does n't mind . "
She peers over the banister to check on Erik .
" We may have denial problems , " she says , almost whispering now .
" If it were me , how would I feel ?
Would I feel it's a useless life , that I 'd rather be dead ?
I 've always been afraid to ask him that .
I 'm scared to hear the truth about what he feels .
Maybe I 'm scared to hear that he wants to leave . "
I ask Sandra if she 's hopeful .
" Honestly , I do n't see it , " she says .
" But I do cling .
I cling to the hope that he could be one of the exceptions -- that as young as he is now , he might be able to make it to when this new research becomes successful .
My main concern is what will happen when we get old .
If we keep him healthy , he 'll probably live as long as you and me .
He could stay like this another forty years . "
Every so often , Erik drops a hint that his old self is still hiding inside his crippled body .
When a pretty girl walks by , he 'll look up at his father to see if he noticed .
" I think he has a thing for Hispanic chicks , " Eddie tells me one day as we sit at a picnic table in his backyard , amid the overgrown weeds he has n't had time to tend , next to an outline of the deck he has n't had time to build .
Eddie works the 5:00 A.M. to 1:00 P.M. shift at the Athens post office , an hour away .
When he gets home from work , he takes Erik on a daily walk around the local track .
He knows his son loves to watch the girls jog .
When the opportunity presents itself , Eddie will push Erik behind a woman with big breasts or an enormous butt .
It never fails to make him laugh .
Laughing and crying , it turns out , are two things he can still do -- although his dry tear ducts produce no drops .
They 're involuntary reactions , like jerking a finger off a hot surface , that originate in more primitive parts of the nervous system that the accident left untouched .
When Erik laughs , there 's no mistaking it .
His body spasms and he emits a high - pitched shriek that sounds as if he 's just been stabbed in the kidneys .
For a while Erik had a Hispanic nurse who spoke barely a word of English .
He would use the letter chart to send her in search of preposterously titled films .
When she 'd come back and tell him she could n't find the movie he was looking for , he 'd laugh uproariously .
During those first years after the accident , Erik could spell out sentences as fast as his human translators could keep up .
But in 2004 , he was struck with a bout of pneumonia that sent him back to the hospital for three weeks .
When he got out , it was clear to everyone who knew him that he'd changed .
He had become slower and even more withdrawn than before .
And for some reason , he was no longer able to work the letter board .
He 'd spell out gobbledygook , or refuse to use it at all .
" I do n't know what part of him we lost then , " his former special - education teacher , Vicki Conway , says .
" What he was spelling no longer made any sense .
But then again , he could have been bullshitting me .
My sense , though , is he would have wanted to communicate if he could . "
After the pneumonia , it became a whole lot harder to read Erik 's eyes .
The movements were more subtle .
You often had to ask him a question twice to figure out whether he was saying yes or no .
Eventually , his parents stopped bothering with the letter chart and put it away .
Since then , Erik has n't communicated a single word .
Elinor Carucci
It 's a challenge to interview someone who can hear everything but can answer only yes or no .
There are questions I want to ask Erik but that I 'm afraid might be cruel .
Do you feel your life is worth living ?
Do you ever contemplate suicide ?
If there were more to his responses than the motion of his eyeballs , I might be able to guess what he 's feeling .
I might not ask certain questions , or I might press harder .
But even the most mundane questions are difficult to ask , because they 've got to be phrased in a way that they can be answered with a binary response .
My questions all have to begin with do ; I wish they could begin with how .
" Do you think about your life before the accident often ? " I ask him .
He looks down .
" That 's a no , " says Eddie , translating the barely perceptible motions of Erik 's eyes .
" Do you remember the moment when you realized that you could no longer move or speak ? "
He looks down again .
" Do you think about the future ? "
His eyes open wide .
" Do you feel you 've come to peace with what happened ? "
He looks up .
" But you do n't like it , do you ? " Eddie adds .
He looks down .
" If I were in your situation , I 'd be pissed , too , " says Eddie .
Yes , Erik believes in God , but no , he does n't pray .
Yes , he feels that his days , on average , are getting better .
Yes , he believes that he 'll someday be able to express himself through the implant .
Yes , he 's constantly in pain .
No , the rest of us can't imagine what it 's like .
Yes , he lies with his eyes often .
No , he no longer spends much time thinking about what he could do if he could move .
No , even in his dreams , he does n't move .
Yes , he does have in mind the first thing he 'll say when he can finally speak again .
Yes , he occasionally feels the need to scream .
Yes , his friends let him down .
Most of Erik 's high school pals dropped out of his life pretty quickly after the accident .
" It was n't that they did n't care , " says Mike Wood , the only friend who still visits with any regularity .
" It was just too tough . "
Especially for Erik 's buddy Chris , the boy who was driving the Camaro .
He used to come by from time to time , and then only on Erik 's birthdays .
Eventually he disappeared altogether .
Erik 's days are unimaginably lonely .
Sometimes , for long stretches he will seem to disappear into another dimension .
He sits there with his eyes open , his mind churning , but he 's completely unresponsive to the world around him .
Eddie says he often comes downstairs in the middle of the night to find Erik lying awake , staring at the ceiling .
Erik told his mother once , back when he could still use the letter chart , that he transports himself to a different world .
But he never spelled out what that world is like .
There 's one question I dread asking -- the question that hangs over everything : Would Erik rather be dead ?
Nobody has ever asked him , so nobody knows .
I try to find the most delicate way to bring it up .
" Do you ever wish you had n't survived the car crash ? "
I can't tell which way his eyes move .
Eddie is silent .
He scratches his leg .
I ask again .
I look to Eddie .
I look back at Erik .
Eddie shakes his head .
" He 's saying , ' No . ' "
On the wall near Kennedy 's engraved patents there is another small poster that reads TOTAL BCI MARKET : 6,301,163,435 BRAINS IN THE WORLD .
In other words , everyone .
Cochlear implants , the first commercially successful brain - computer interfaces , have already allowed 100,000 deaf people to hear .
Soon the blind will be able to see through cameras that transmit images straight to the visual cortex , and the paralyzed will control robotic limbs as if they were their own .
All this is already being done with lab animals .
But healing the sick is just the beginning of the BCI revolution that Kennedy and others in his field envision .
Imagine , Kennedy suggests , a " personal digital assistant in the brain . "
Or a digital surrogate memory that remembers everything .
Or the entire contents of Google a single thought away .
Or , more likely , some other application that would be impossible to anticipate today .
But what does seem unstoppable is the expanding overlap between our minds and our machines .
Once you start pondering what it would mean to merge brains and computers -- to truly integrate our physical minds with our artificial ones -- it can provoke some queasy thoughts about the location of the soul , the nature of consciousness , and what it means to be human .
All of a sudden , what we think of as the mind starts to sound like something far more distributed , and far hazier than it 's comfortable to contemplate .
We tend to think of the self , our ineffable essence , as a starkly delimited entity .
Even if modern cognitive neuroscience has rejected René Descartes 's old idea of a homuncular soul that resides in the pineal gland and controls the human body , the fact is that most of us still believe there is a distinct " me " somewhere up there driving the bus .
At the very least , most people would assume that their self could not possibly extend beyond the boundary of their body into a computer .
But why should that necessarily be the case ?
Is it even the case today ?
" Human beings are already natural - born cyborgs , " says Andy Clark , a philosopher at the University of Edinburgh who writes about the metaphysical problems posed by BCIs .
For as long as we 've been humans , we 've been intermingling our minds with technology .
In fact , it 's one of the most essentially human things we do .
What are pen and paper if not cognitive prostheses ?
What was the invention of algebra if not a " mindware upgrade ? "
And what are books if not external repositories for the contents of our brains ?
I 'm typing this on a laptop , which is doing all sorts of thinking so that my own brain does n't have to , and whose hard drive contains a trove of documents that are , in a very real way , an extension of my own memory .
I 've already got a brain - computer interface : my eyes and my fingers .
Yes , it 's primitive , and yes , it 's noninvasive , but it's on the same evolutionary continuum as Kennedy 's electrode implants .
We 're all , as Clark puts it , " cyborgs without surgery , symbionts without sutures . "
With Erik , though , it 's quite a bit harder to pin down where the man ends and the machine begins .
Consider how much fuzzier that line will become if BCIs can someday control not just prosthetic voices but entire prosthetic bodies -- another one of the unsettling scenarios Kennedy foresees .
" I imagine it 's possible that someday you 'll have simply an isolated brain on a support system , functioning better than any human brain out there now , " Kennedy tells me with a nervous chuckle .
" It 's kind of scary , but it 's what 's going to happen . "
We 'll see .
But you do n't have to be a reactionary , a fundamentalist , or a Luddite to wonder whether plugging minds into computers is ultimately such a terrific idea .
Even Kennedy himself is ambivalent about where his research may someday lead .
I ask him whether he'd ever want to have one of the brave new BCIs he 's describing installed in his own head .
" I 'm not sure I would , " he says .
" And I 'm not sure I should be allowed to . "
Not surprisingly , the military has taken a keen interest in all of this .
While Kennedy gets his funding from the NIH , some of his peers in the BCI field are bankrolled by DARPA , the Defense Department 's advanced - research wing , which hopes today 's work with monkeys and quadriplegics will pay off in the future with fighter jets that respond instantaneously to pilots ' thoughts and robotic marines safely controlled by brains on the other side of the world .
" If cloning is controversial today , the field of BCI will be just as controversial tomorrow , " Kennedy predicts .
Probably even more so .
Today , bioethicists work up sweats over such hot - potato topics as genetic engineering and " cognitive steroids , " but these kinds of enhancements are just tweaking the dials compared with what it would mean to fully marry computers and brains .
A smarter , taller , stronger , disease - resistant person who lives to 150 is still , in the end , just a person .
But if we could give someone a perfect memory , the processing power of a supercomputer , and a mind that taps directly into the entire collective knowledge of humanity , well , that 's when we 'd need to expand our vocabulary .
What Kennedy is ultimately talking about is a final escape from the biology of being human .
" It 's around here somewhere , " says Eddie , searching the bookcase next to Erik 's bed .
The folded , laminated piece of paper he 's looking for , about the size of a tabloid newspaper , turns up under a stack of towels .
" He has n't used this thing in , what , four years ? " I ask .
" Not much . "
" Do you think he might be interested in trying it again ? "
" We could always ask . "
He carries the board over to Erik and shows it to him .
" Do you want to try to dictate ?
Do you remember how ? "
Erik looks up .
Back when he was using the chart all the time , he had it memorized , but that was so long ago that Eddie figures he better hold it in front of Erik 's face .
He settles into a chair next to him and glances at his wife , who has come over to hold Erik 's hand .
This could be the first time since 2004 that Erik communicates anything more than a yes or a no , but Eddie and Sandra seem surprisingly blasé about the exercise .
After a few false starts , Eddie coaxes the first letter out of Erik .
It 's the first letter on the fifth line .
" Are you sure it 's an a , Erik ? "
He looks up and coughs violently .
Eddie has to put down the chart to squirt some water into Erik 's throat and then suck out the phlegm with a dentist 's vacuum hose .
Eddie keeps running through the board .
The next letter is m .
Then a .
Then n .
For some reason , Erik starts laughing .
" It 's that funny and you 've only spelled four letters ? " asks Eddie .
" This must be something really funny . "
Next is a d .
Eddie repeats the letters to himself : " A - M - A - N - D . "
" Amanda ? "
His voice rises .
" Is that what you 're trying to say ?
Amanda ? "
He chuckles and slaps his knee .
" You 're spelling the name of a girl ? "
It does seem an improbably romantic first word to have been incubating all these years .
Eddie gets excited and yells into the kitchen to Erik 's brother .
" Matt , who 's Amanda ?
Was that one of the Playboy bunnies in that big picture he had ? "
" I do n't know , " says Matt .
Eddie asks him to get Mike Wood on the phone .
Matt has him on speed dial .
" Ask him if he knows any Amandas . "
Matt comes back into the den .
" Mike says he does n't know any Amandas . "
Eddie asks Erik again .
" Who 's Amanda ?
Is that the name of the blue - haired girl who visited you in the hospital ? "
Erik 's eyes do n't move .
The doorbell rings .
Eddie folds up the letter board .
The pizza is here .
Later that week , I e-mail Eddie to ask him what he makes of Erik 's attempt to spell .
We had gone back after dinner and tried again , but we never got anything more than an f out of him .
In the rush of trying to get everything into my notebook , I had n't really processed what he might have been trying to say .
But reviewing my notes now , I 'm haunted by the possibility that we 'd cut him off too soon .
What if he'd been trying to say , " A man d . . . " ?
( The letter chart does n't have a space bar . )
Eddie writes back to say we should try the letter chart again .
He also suggests that the next time we try to get Erik to spell , it might go faster if there 's a pretty young woman at Erik 's arm helping him .
What he does n't suggest , but what we both know might very well be the case , is that a - m - a - n-d might not mean anything at all .
When I return to Duluth three weeks later , in late May , we load Erik into the Ramseys ' specially outfitted van and drive him over to the Neural Signals office , where Deanna Felice , a rising senior at Georgia Tech who works in Kennedy 's
lab , has offered to help .
She 's wearing a blue dress and a pearl necklace .
She keeps one hand on Erik 's the entire time .
Kennedy lowers himself to eye level with Erik .
" This is your big chance to say whatever you want to -- how many people read Esquire ? "
" I do n't know , many millions . "
I figure the exaggeration wo n't hurt anybody .
" To millions of people , Erik ! "
Deanna puts the chart in front of his face .
" Is the first letter on line one , Erik ? "
Each letter takes about a minute to work out , and Erik 's eye movements are now so subtle that Eddie has to be called in to interpret them .
T . . . O . . . F . . . M .
" Did we miss a letter in there ? " I ask .
" Is there supposed to be an e in between the f and the m ? " suggests Eddie .
He looks up .
N . . .
I . . .
T .
" Is that all correct ? " Yes .
" Do you want to stop ? " No .
N . . . T . . .
A . . . L .
" Erik , do you remember how to spell ? "
Yes .
Kennedy writes the letters on a dry - erase board and props it up in front of Erik 's wheelchair .
ZZ
Top is playing in the background .
" Erik , to me as a bystander , this does n't make sense , " says Eddie .
" We 've got to get it to the point where it makes sense .
Is there supposed to be a w between the t and the o ? "
Yes .
" Is everything else right ? "
Yes .
" I can't even begin to fathom how frustrating this must be , " I tell Erik .
Not for the first time , I have the uncomfortable inkling that we 're trying to read a Ouija board and that this whole exercise is a charade for my benefit .
Despite the occasional blinked - out memoir , the inner lives of locked - in patients remain , basically , a mystery .
Few have lived as long as Erik ; fewer still have had the capacity to describe their experience .
And so nobody can say just how much of Erik is still in there .
Nine years is a very long time for a mind to be in total isolation .
It 's possible that his brain has done what his body cannot : slowly shut itself down .
A . . . G . . .
O . . . C . . .
O . . . K .
" Do you still have more to say ? "
Yes .
Y . . . T . . .
A . . . X . . . U .
" Erik , are you getting tired ? "
Yes .
Kennedy points at the whiteboard and goes letter by letter asking him if each is correct , and then where the spaces should go .
When he 's done rearranging , the board reads : " TWO FEM N ITNA LA GO COKYT AXU . "
We all stare at it , trying to decipher the hieroglyphs , Erik 's first sentence in years .
Dr. Kennedy shakes his head .
Eddie leaves the room to take a walk .
Who knows why Erik lost the ability to spell .
It 's just one of the many mysteries of his condition .
But even while his linguistic abilities have backslid in one domain , they 've been making substantial progress in another .
It 's been six weeks since I first watched Erik do his speech exercises in Dr. Kennedy 's lab , and in that short time he 's become much more adept at making the computer obey his commands .
Back in early April , he was having trouble producing a single vowel sound consistently .
Now he 's stringing together chains of two , even three vowels at a time , and he 's making far fewer errors .
Kennedy asks a research aide to reconfigure the software so Erik can roam around the " vowel space " with total freedom .
" Try uh - ah , " Kennedy says .
The cursor jumps around the screen from hut to hat , and the deep computer voice echoes the trembling sound that Erik 's brain is trying to produce .
Next he tries uh - oh and then uh - oo , and makes them both perfectly .
Kennedy puts his face right in front of Erik's .
" You can really do it when you want to , " he says ecstatically .
" This time I want you to go from oe to oo and then up to ee . "
The hard ee sound is the vowel Erik has been having the most trouble with .
To make it , he has to think about spreading the edges of his lips and stretching his cheeks .
The part of the premotor cortex that controls the cheeks is right next to the region that controls the lips , tongue , and jaw , where Erik 's implant sits , but Kennedy suspects the cheek neurons may still be too far away for the implant to catch their firing signals .
Nevertheless , when Erik practices tying together an oe - oo - ee nine times in a row , he nails it on six , only failing on the other three tests because of a cough or a spasm .
It 's hardly speech , but Kennedy and Guenther are now on the verge of introducing their new computational model designed to allow Erik to produce consonants as well , and eventually real , meaningful sentences .
But even with just vowels , there is a lot he should soon be able to say .
In the 1950s , a Swedish linguist named Gunnar Fant demonstrated that you can string together the sorts of vowellike sounds that Erik can already make to form slurred but comprehensible speech .
Kennedy pulls up a program on his computer screen to show me .
It 's the same vowel map Erik has been navigating with his mind , only Kennedy can now control it with his mouse .
As he loops his cursor around the screen , a sound comes out of the speaker : " Ow - uuuuuuh - oo .
Ai-uuuuuh - oo . "
He makes it again , and this time I hear it : " How are you ?
I love you . "
And again :
" How are you ?
I love you . "
" How are you ?
I love you . "
" How are you ?
I love you . "
Dr. Kennedy turns to Erik , who has been watching us the whole time .
" I 'd like him to be able to say that to his father . "
Erik 's body shivers in one of his regular , and painful , muscle spasms , and then sinks back into his wheelchair .
The session is over , but Eddie has n't yet returned from his walk .
Kennedy plays some Ozzy Osbourne , and the two of us sit in the corner making small talk about the Atlanta traffic .
There 's nothing for Erik to do but stare at the wall and listen and wait .

Removing Oil from Renewable Tech
September 8th , 2008 by Michelle Bennett
Renewable energy is expanding quickly these days .
But it ’s still a fact that these technologies rely on petroleum and petroleum products for transportation and production .
Now that is starting to change .
A solar panel producer called BioSolar has replaced a vital component of their silicon panels with a cheaper petroleum - free alternative .
Silicon panels require a protective backsheet to keep out moisture and protect the panel .
Usually this backsheet is made from plastic , and practically all traditional plastics are petroleum - based .
BioSolar ’s backsheet is made from cotton rags and castor beans .
They turn the cotton rags into a film of cellulose and blend in nylon made from the beans .
The resulting cover lasts just as long or longer than the plastic blacksheet , and they keep out the moisture too .
BioSolar also avoids genetically - modified crops .
The best part about it is the cost : up to 50 % less than traditional plastic backsheets .
As the price of petroleum and petroleum - products rise , this alternative starts to look more lucrative than altruistic .
Despite removing the plastic from panels , this is not a complete divorce from fossil fuels .
Producing the parts for solar and wind energy still take energy , and the finished product must still be transported to consumers .
The majority of that energy is still sourced from fossil fuels .
Obviously the larger your bits and pieces , the more energy this requires .
Biosolar has proven that petroleum products are not necessary to produce renewable energy .
As renewable technology and biofuels expand into the market , it will become increasingly cheaper and easier to make renewable energy more renewable .

Are you searching for quick ways to improve your concentration and performance ?
Do you need to stay alert and focused ?
How about improving your level of performance without caffeine and sugar ?
To stay alert and smart , your brain needs glucose .
But grabbing a sugary snack to improve your mental energy will not work in the long run .
It 's true that eating something that contains sugar will improve your mental performance because of the quick spike of glucose .
Eating a candy bar makes us feel great for a short time .
But this wo n't be effective in the long run .
Why ?
Because after the quick glucose spike , your glucose level will then drop dramatically and when this happens your brain will lose its ability to concentrate on anything .
Often we even lose our will power and common sense and may grab another candy bar to create a defeating cycle .
The key to long term stability is to avoid sugar .
When you choose natural snacks instead , your body is able to utilize a slowly released supply of glucose .
This will not set us up for that roller coaster of highs and lows .
Some easy keys for success :*
Start your day by eating a fiber - rich breakfast like oatmeal .
This will deliver glucose over a longer period of time without the energy spike previously mentioned . *
By eating this morning meal that is high in fiber you will be more alert during the day .
This has also been connected with more energy and less fatigue throughout the day . *
You may also have fewer memory problems , fall asleep faster and suffer less depression .
Instead of energy drinks that typically contain 8 teaspoons of sugar try an herbal - mineral tonic instead .
A good tonic will invigorate and refresh you physically and mentally .
This is accomplished by revitalizing a number of the body 's systems .
Energy supplements that contain both herbs and minerals will give a boost .
Look for supplements that contain potassium , magnesium , calcium , iron , and an energizing assortment of herbs .
Pay special attention to ingredients and look for a formula that does not contain sugar .
Herbal tonics are effective for increasing stamina , reaction speed , concentration and mental alertness .
Particularly effective are formulas that contain both minerals and small amounts of herbs that are beneficial to the brain .
This includes :* Ginkgo Biloba ( improves memory ) * Ginseng ( performance optimizer ) Other Natural Pick - me-ups :*
Some fats and cholesterol will aid in improving concentration and focus .
Eating fish oils and the essential fatty acids in nuts and avocados is beneficial for concentration .
This is especially true for children and people with attention deficit problems .
Cholesterol is important because it is needed for the brain to function properly .
Cholesterol improves mental function in areas such as visual coordination , memory , attention and concentration .
It has also been suggested that as someone 's cholesterol level rises , their ability to learn , pay attention and remember rises as well .
Be sure to keep your " good " cholesterol level high by eating lots of nuts and avocados . *
Bananas are a great pick - me - up because they are high in potassium .
Potassium is a mineral your body needs to convert sugar in your blood into energy . *
Peppermint not only freshens your breath , it freshens your brain .
The smell of peppermint has been shown to lower fatigue , increase alertness , and decrease frustration .
Peppermint oil increases alertness by stimulating the trigeminal nerve ( this is the same nerve that is activated by smelling salts ) .
Try taking a long whiff of peppermint oil the next time you need a boost .
Peppermint tea is also effective .*
Sometimes a boost is as simple as a drink of water .
Dehydration is a significant factor in fatigue .
A recent study found that even a 2 % dip in one 's hydration level ( this would be the point where you would start to feel a bit thirsty ) contributes to a decrease in short - term memory and even the ability to add and subtract .*
Another effective thing to try is bright light - especially in the morning .
Recent research suggests that bright light exposure early in the day can increase energy for the remainder of the day .
This may be because light stimulates neurotransmitters in the brain and this in turn improves mood and motivation . *
Exercise begets more energy .
If time is a problem , even a mini - work out can be effective .

Fehlerberichte - wie Sie Softwarefehler melden sollten
von Simon Tatham , Berufsprogrammierer und Programmierer freier Software
[ English | Português | 简体中文 | Česky | Dansk | Deutsch | Español | Français | Magyar | Italiano | 日本語 | Nederlands | Polski | Русский | 繁體中文 ]
Einleitung
Jeder , der Software für die Allgemeinheit geschrieben hat , wird wahrscheinlich schon einmal einen schlechten Fehlerbericht erhalten haben .
Nichts sagende Berichte ( " Es geht nicht ! " ) , Berichte , die keinen Sinn ergeben , Berichte , die einem nicht genug Informationen geben , Berichte , die einem falsche Informationen geben .
Berichte von Problemen , die sich schließlich als Fehlbedienung durch den Benutzer herausstellen , oder bei denen das Problem bei einem anderen Programm liegt oder die auf Netzwerkfehler zurückzuführen sind .
Es gibt einen Grund , warum die Arbeit für eine Anwenderhotline als Horror angesehen wird und dieser Grund sind schlechte Fehlerberichte .
Andererseits sind nicht alle Fehlerberichte unangenehm .
Wenn ich nicht gerade meinen Lebensunterhalt verdiene , so entwickle und pflege ich freie Software und manchmal erhalte ich wunderbar klare , hilfreiche , informative Fehlerberichte .
In dieser Anleitung werde ich versuchen , Ihnen klarzumachen , was einen guten Fehlerbericht ausmacht .
Meine Idealvorstellung wäre es , dass jeder diese Anleitung liest , bevor er irgendwem irgendwelche Fehlerberichte schickt .
Auf alle Fälle hätte ich es gerne , dass Leute , die mir Fehlerberichte senden , das hier lesen .
Kurz gefasst ist das Ziel eines Fehlerberichts , es dem Programmierer zu ermöglichen , zu sehen , wie das Programm Fehler macht .
Entweder können
Sie es ihm persönlich zeigen oder ihm sorgfältige und genaue Informationen geben , wie er es dazu bringt , den Fehler zu machen .
Wenn er das schafft , so wird er versuchen weitere Informationen zu sammeln , bis er die Ursache kennt .
Wenn er das nicht schafft , so muss er sie bitten die Informationen für ihn zu sammeln .
Versuchen
Sie genau auseinander zu halten , was die tatsächlichen Vorkommnisse waren ( Ich war am Rechner und dies und das passierte .  ) und was Ihre Interpretationen und Spekulationen sind ( Ich denke es könnte an Folgendem liegen ... ) .
Wenn
Sie es nicht wünschen , so brauchen Sie Ihre Spekulationen nicht mitzuteilen , aber bitte beschreiben Sie alle tatsächlichen Vorkommnisse .
Wenn Sie einen Fehler melden , dann weil Sie ihn repariert haben wollen .
Es macht keinen Sinn , den Programmierer zu verfluchen oder absichtlich möglichst wenig hilfreich zu sein :
Es mag der Fehler des Programmierers sein , dass Sie ein Problem haben und Sie ärgern sich möglicherweise vollkommen zu Recht über ihn , aber der Fehler wird schneller behoben werden , indem Sie ihm dadurch helfen , dass Sie ihm alle Informationen geben , die er braucht .
Übrigens :
Wenn es sich um freie Software handelt , haben Sie sie diese aufgrund der Nettigkeit des Autors bekommen .
Wenn zu viele Leute sich ihm gegenüber ungehobelt aufführen , lässt diese Nettigkeit vielleicht nach .
 Es geht nicht . 
Gehen
Sie davon aus , dass der Programmierer kein Volltrottel ist : Wenn das Programm überhaupt nicht funktionieren würde , so wäre es ihm aufgefallen .
Da das nicht der Fall ist , wird es bei ihm wohl gehen .
Also tun Sie etwas anders oder die Arbeitsumgebung bei Ihnen ist anders .
Er braucht Information ; diese Information zur Verfügung zu stellen ist der Zweck eines Fehlerberichts .
Mehr Information ist immer besser als weniger .
Von vielen Programmen , insbesondere von freien , gibt es eine veröffentlichte Liste der bekannten Fehler .
Wenn
Sie solch eine Liste finden können , so sollten Sie sie lesen um festzustellen ob der von Ihnen gefundenen Fehler darauf schon vorkommt .
Wenn er schon bekannt ist , so ist er es wahrscheinlich nicht wert , dass Sie ihn wieder berichten , .
Wenn
Sie aber meinen , Sie haben mehr Informationen als in der Fehlerliste schon vorhanden , wäre es vielleicht günstig , den Programmierer trotzdem zu benachrichtigen .
Er kann den Fehler möglicherweise eher beheben , wenn Sie ihm Informationen geben , die er noch nicht hatte .
Diese Anleitung beschreibt einige Richtlinien .
Keine von ihnen ist eine eiserne Regel .
Verschiedene Programmierer haben verschiedene Vorlieben wie man Fehler berichten soll .
Wenn das Programm seine eigenen Richtlinien hierfür mitbringt , so lesen
Sie sie diese und wenn sie dem widersprechen , was hier steht , richten Sie sich nach den Richtlinien die Sie mit dem Programms erhielten !
Wenn Sie keinen Fehler berichten sondern nur um Hilfe zur Programmbedienung bitten , sollten Sie sagen , wo Sie schon überall nach einer Antwort gesucht haben .
( Ich habe Kapitel 4 durchgelesen und den Abschnitt 5.2 , konnte aber nichts finden , was darauf hindeutet ob das möglich ist oder nicht .)
Dadurch erfahren die Programmierer , wo die Anwender die Antwort auf ihre Fragen erwarten und sie können die Dokumentation besser gestalten .
 Zeigen Sie es mir . 
Eine der besten Methoden einen Fehler zu berichten ist , ihn dem Programmierer zu zeigen .
Zitieren Sie ihn zu Ihrem Rechner , starten Sie das Programm und zeigen Sie , was schief ging .
Lassen Sie ihn den Start ihres Rechners beobachten , wie Sie das Programm bedienen , was Sie genau tun und wie das Programm darauf reagiert .
Programmierer kennen ihre Software wie ihre Westentaschen .
Sie wissen , welche Teile am vertrauenswürdigsten sind und welche am wahrscheinlichsten aussetzen .
Sie wissen intuitiv , wonach sie Ausschau zu halten haben .
Schon lange vor dem Zeitpunkt , zu dem das Programm offensichtlichen Unfug macht , ist ihnen vielleicht ein subtiler Fehler aufgefallen , der einen wertvollen Hinweis liefert .
Sie können alles , was der Rechner während des Testlaufs macht , beobachten und diese wichtigen Details selbst herausfinden .
Vielleicht reicht das aber noch nicht .
Möglicherweise wollen sie mehr Informationen und bitten Sie , ihnen das Ganze noch einmal vorzuführen .
Oder Sie wollen von Ihnen , dass
Sie ihnen dabei zusehen und Anleitung geben , so dass sie selbst den Fehler erzeugen können , so oft sie das wollen .
Vielleicht versuchen sie den genauen Ablauf einige Mal zu ändern , um zu sehen , ob das Problem nur ein einem speziellen Fall von vielen ähnlichen auftritt .
Wenn Sie Pech haben , belegen sie vielleicht ihren Computer einige Stunden mit Beschlag , um mit Hilfe spezieller Entwicklerwerkzeuge dem Problem richtig zu Leibe zu rücken .
Aber das Wichtigste ist , dass die Programmierer es sehen , wenn der Computer Unsinn macht .
Sobald sie das Problem sehen , können sie von diesem Anhaltspunkt aus meist daran arbeiten es zu beheben .
 Zeigen Sie mir , wie ich es mir selbst zeigen kann . 
Wir haben das Zeitalter des Internets und der weltweiten Kommunikation .
Heutzutage kann ich meine Software mit einem Knopfdruck nach Russland schicken und der Empfänger kann mir genauso leicht seine Kommentare senden .
Wenn er aber ein Problem mit meinem Programm hat kann ich mich nicht vor seinen Rechner stellen , während der Fehler passiert .
 Zeigen
Sie es mir ist eine gute Devise , wenn das geht , aber oft geht es nicht .
Wenn sie einen Fehlerbericht für einen Programmierer verfassen , der nicht anwesend sein kann , so versuchen Sie es ihm zu ermöglichen , den Fehler nachzuvollziehen .
Ihr Ziel ist , dass der Programmierer seine Kopie des Programms laufen lässt , die selben Dinge macht , wie Sie und es bei ihm auf die selbe Weise schief geht .
Wenn er das Problem vor seinen eigenen Augen sieht , kann er sich dessen annehmen .
Teilen
Sie alles , was sie tun , ganz exakt mit .
Wenn es ein Programm mit einer graphischen Benutzeroberfläche ist , teilen Sie mit , welche Knöpfe Sie gedrückt haben und in welcher Reihenfolge .
Wenn Sie einen Befehl eingegeben haben , sagen Sie , was Sie genau getippt haben .
Wenn möglich erstellen
Sie ein genaues Skript aller Dinge , die Sie getan haben und wie der Computer darauf reagierte .
Geben Sie den Programmierern alle Informationen , die Sie haben .
Wenn das Programm aus einer Datei liest , müssen Sie wahrscheinlich eine Kopie der Datei zur Verfügung stellen .
Wenn das Programm in einem Netzwerk auf einen anderen Computer zugreift so können
Sie zumindest sagen , welche Art von Computer das ist und  falls Sie es wissen  welche Programme darauf laufen .
 Bei mir geht's .
Wo ist das Problem ? 
Wenn Sie den Programmierern eine lange Liste Ihrer Eingaben und der Ausgaben des Rechners geben , aber bei deren Computer alles funktioniert , so haben Sie noch nicht genug Informationen zur Verfügung gestellt .
Vielleicht tritt das Problem nicht bei jedem Rechner auf .
Deren System und das Ihre unterscheiden sich vielleicht teilweise .
Möglicherweise haben
Sie die Funktionsweise des Programms missverstanden und sie sehen alle dieselbe Anzeige , nur sind Sie der Auffassung , dass sie falsch ist und die Programmierer wissen , dass es stimmt .
Beschreiben
Sie also auch genau , was geschah .
Sagen Sie ihnen , was Sie sehen .
Sagen
Sie ihnen , warum Sie das , was Sie sehen für falsch halten , besser noch beschreiben Sie genau , was sie eigentlich zu sehen erwarteten .
Wenn sie einfach sagen und das hat nicht funktioniert , haben Sie eine wichtige Information ausgelassen .
Wenn Fehlermeldungen erscheinen , so sagen Sie den Programmierern genau und detailliert , welche das waren .
Diese Meldungen sind wichtig !
Zu diesem Zeitpunkt versuchen die Programmierer noch gar nicht den Fehler zu beheben , sondern nur herauszufinden , was der Fehler eigentlich ist .
Sie müssen erfahren , was falsch lief und diese Meldungen sind der beste Versuch des Rechners , Ihnen das mitzuteilen .
Schreiben Sie die Fehler auf , wenn
Sie sich sonst nicht daran erinnern können , aber es macht keinen Sinn einen Fehler zu berichten , wenn Sie nicht sagen können , wie die Fehlermeldung lautete .
Insbesondere , wenn die Fehlermeldung eine Nummer ausgibt , geben Sie diese Nummer an den Programmierer weiter .
Nur dass
Sie in ihr keinen Sinn erkennen können , heißt nicht , dass sie keinen Sinn macht .
Nummern enthalten alle Arten wichtiger Informationen die ein Programmierer verstehen kann , und es ist wahrscheinlich , dass sie wichtige Hinweise enthalten .
Fehlermeldungen haben Nummern , weil der Computer zu verwirrt ist , den Fehler in Worten zu berichten , aber er versucht das Beste zu tun , um Ihnen irgendwie diese Information zu vermitteln .
Zu diesem Zeitpunkt ist Programmieren im Wesentlichen Detektivarbeit .
Die Programmierer wissen nicht , was passierte und sie kommen nicht nahe genug an das Problem heran , um es selbst zu beobachten , also suchen Sie nach Hinweisen , die sie auf die richtige Spuren führen können .
Fehlermeldungen , unverständliche Aneinanderreihungen von Nummern und auch unerwartetes Stocken des Programms sind alles Fingerabdrücke am Tatort des Verbrechens .
Bewahren
Sie sie auf !
Wenn Sie Unix verwenden , hat das Programm möglicherweise einen Core Dump erzeugt .
Core Dumps sind eine besonders nützliche Quelle von Hinweisen , also werfen Sie sie nicht weg .
Andererseits mögen es die meisten Programmierer nicht , wenn sie ohne Vorwarnung riesige Core Dateien geschickt bekommen , also fragen Sie bitte , bevor Sie sie jemandem zusenden .
Außerdem sollten
Sie wissen , dass die Core Datei eine komplette Aufzeichnung des Stands des Programms enthält :
Alle möglichen  Geheimnisse befinden sich in der Core Datei ( möglicherweise hat das Programm gerade eine persönliche Nachricht transportiert oder vertrauliche Daten bearbeitet ) .
 Dann habe ich noch versucht 
Es gibt eine Menge Dinge , die Sie tun können , wenn eine Fehler oder eigentümliches Verhalten auftritt .
Etliche dieser Dinge verschlimmern das Problem .
Eine Schulfreundin löschte versehentlich all ihre Word Dokumente und bevor sie einen Experten rief , versuchte sie Word neu zu installieren und dann führte sie Defrag aus .
Nichts davon war hilfreich dabei , ihre Dateien wiederzubeleben und sie sortierte damit ihre Festplatte so um , dass kein Undelete Programm auf der Welt mehr in der Lage gewesen wäre irgendetwas zu retten .
Hätte sie nichts getan , so hätte sie eine Chance gehabt .
Anwender reagieren wie eine in die Ecke gedrängte Manguste .
Mit dem Rücken zur Wand und dem sicheren
Tod ins Auge blickend greift sie wie wildgeworden an , weil etwas zu tun besser sein muss , als nichts zu tun .
Das ist keine gute angepasste Reaktion auf die Art von Problemen , die Computer verursachen .
Anstatt wie eine Manguste sollten Sie sich wie eine Antilope verhalten .
Wenn eine Antilope etwas Unerwartetem , Furchteinflößendem gegenübersteht , so rührt sie sich nicht vom Fleck .
Sie bleibt vollkommen unbeweglich und versucht keine Aufmerksamkeit auf sich zu ziehen , während sie nachdenkt , was zu tun wohl das Beste sei .
( Wenn Antilopen telefonische Produktunterstützung hätten , würden sie zu diesem Zeitpunkt telefonieren . )
Dann , sobald sie sich entschieden hat , was das Sicherste ist , tut sie es .
Wenn etwas schief läuft , hören
Sie sofort auf irgendetwas zu tun .
Fassen
Sie überhaupt keine Taste mehr an .
Schauen Sie sich die Bildschirmausgabe an , suchen Sie nach allem , was außergewöhnlich aussieht und merken Sie es sich oder schreiben Sie es auf .
Dann können
Sie möglicherweise vorsichtig dazu übergehen ,  OK  oder  Abbrechen zu drücken , was immer Ihnen am Sichersten erscheint .
Versuchen Sie , dieses Verhalten in Fleisch und Blut übergehen zu lassen  wenn der Computer etwas Unerwartetes tut , rühren Sie sich nicht .
Wenn
Sie es schaffen , sich aus der misslichen Lage zu befreien , sei es durch Schließen des Programms oder durch Neustart Ihres Computers , wäre es eine gute Sache zu versuchen , den Fehler nochmals auftreten zu lassen .
Programmierer mögen Probleme die sie öfter als einmal erzeugen können .
Glückliche Programmierer beheben Fehler schneller und effektiver .
 Vermutlich ist die Polarisierung der Tachyonenmodulation falsch 
Es ist nicht so , dass nur Nicht - Programmierer schlechte Fehlerberichte schreiben .
Einige der fürchterlichsten Fehlerberichte die ich je gesehen habe kamen von Programmierern und noch dazu von guten Programmierern .
Ich hatte einen Kollegen , der häufig Fehler in seinem Code fand und sie zu reparieren versuchte .
Wenn er auf einen
Fehler stieß , den er nicht beheben konnte , rief er mich zu Hilfe .
 Was funktioniert nicht ?  , fragte ich .
Er antwortete indem er mir seine augenblickliche Meinung schilderte , was das Problem verursacht habe .
Das funktionierte wunderbar , wenn seine augenblickliche Meinung richtig war .
Er hatte dann schon die halbe Arbeit getan und wir waren in der Lage es gemeinsam zu Ende zu bringen .
Es war effizient und nützlich .
Aber oft lag er auch falsch .
Wir versuchten dann einige Zeit herauszufinden , warum ein bestimmter Teil des Programms falsche Daten erzeugte , nur um schließlich zu erkennen , dass er das gar nicht tat .
Wir hatten eine halbe Stunde einwandfrei funktionierenden Code untersucht und das wirkliche Problem lag ganz wo anders .
Ich bin mir sicher , bei einem
Arzt würde er das nicht tun .
 Herr Doktor , ich denke ich habe Parkinson .
Die Leute wissen , dass man sich einem
Arzt gegenüber nicht so verhält .
Man beschreibt die Symptome , die tatsächlichen Beschwerden , das Unwohlsein und die Probleme , die Schmerzen und Ausschläge und das Fieber und überlässt dem Arzt die Diagnose , was dies verursacht .
Andernfalls hält Sie der Arzt für einen Hypochonder oder einem Spinner und das nicht zu Unrecht .
Genauso verhält es sich mit Programmierern .
Es mag manchmal hilfreich sein , wenn Sie Ihre eigene Diagnose anführen , aber listen Sie immer auch die Symptome auf .
Die Diagnose ist etwas Zusätzliches und keine Alternative zum Angeben der Symptome .
Auch das Senden einer Änderung für den Code um das Problem zu beheben ist eine nützliche Zusatzangabe aber kein angemessener Ersatz für eine Fehlerbeschreibung .
Wenn die Programmierer um Zusatzinformationen bitten , so erfinden Sie diese nicht einfach !
Einmal berichtete mir jemand einen Fehler und ich bat ihn ein Kommando auszuprobieren , von dem ich wusste , dass es nicht funktionieren würde .
Ich wollte wissen , welche von zwei möglichen Fehlermeldungen er erhalten würde .
Dieses Wissen konnte mir einen wichtigen Hinweis geben .
Aber er versuchte es nicht , sondern schrieb mir nur zurück ,  Nein , das wird nicht gehen . 
Ich brauchte etliche Zeit , bis ich ihn überzeugt hatte , es wirklich auszuprobieren .
Es ist wunderbar , wenn Sie Ihre Intelligenz dazu benutzen wollen , dem Programmierer zu helfen .
Auch wenn Ihre Schlüsse falsch sind , sollte der Programmierer dankbar sein , dass Sie wenigstens versucht haben , sein Leben zu erleichtern .
Aber berichten
Sie auch die Symptome , sonst könnte es passieren , dass Sie es stattdessen erschweren .
 Ist ja lustig .
Gerade eben hats noch nicht funktioniert 
Sie brauchen nur sporadisch auftretender Fehler zu sagen und schon bekommt jeder Programmierer ein langes Gesicht .
Die Fehler , die durch eine einfache Folge von Handlungen hervorgerufen werden können , sind leicht .
Der Programmierer kann die Handlungen unter gut kontrollierten Bedingungen wiederholen und im Detail beobachten , was geschieht .
Zu viele Probleme sind aber nicht von dieser Art : Es gibt Programme , die einmal in der Woche ausfallen oder alle heiligen Zeiten oder nie , wenn man sie in Anwesenheit eines Programmierers verwendet , aber immer wenn ein Abgabetermin näher rückt .
Die meisten sporadisch auftretenden Fehler treten nicht wirklich zufällig auf .
Meistens gibt es irgendwo ein verborgenes System .
Manche treten auf , wenn dem Rechner der Speicher ausgeht , manche wenn ein anderes Programm im falschen Augenblick eine wichtige Datei verändert und manche nur in der ersten halben Stunde jeder vollen Stunde .
( So etwas ist mir tatsächlich begegnet . )
Wenn Sie den Fehler auftreten lassen können , der Programmierer aber nicht , so kann es darin liegen , dass ihre Rechner verschieden sind und diese Verschiedenheit das Problem verursacht .
Ich hatte einmal ein Programm , dessen Fenster sich sich zu einem Fleck in der linken oberen Bildschirmecke zusammenzog , sich dort festbiss und einem auf die Nerven ging .
Aber das tat es nur bei einer Bildschirmauflösung von 800x600 ; auf meinem 1024x768 Monitor funktionierte es problemlos .
Die Programmierer werden alles wissen wollen , was Sie über das Problem herausfinden konnten .
Versuchen
Sie es etwa auch auf einem anderen Computer .
Versuchen
Sie es zwei- oder dreimal , um zu erfahren , wie oft es fehlschlägt .
Wenn es schief geht , wenn
Sie ernsthaft arbeiten , aber nicht , wenn Sie versuchen das Problem zu zeigen , könnte es sein , dass lange Laufzeit oder die Bearbeitung großer Dateien die Ursache ist .
Versuchen
Sie sich an so viel Details , dessen was Sie taten , als es fehlschlug , wie nur möglich zu erinnern und wenn
Sie meinen , darin eine Regelmäßigkeit zu erkennen , so sagen Sie es bitte .
Alles was sie sagen können , kann von Nutzen sein .
Selbst wenn es nur eine ungefähre Ahnung ist ( wie etwa es scheint eher abzustürzen , wenn Emacs läuft ) .
Es ist vielleicht kein direkter Hinweis auf das Problem , aber es könnte dem Programmierer helfen es nachzuvollziehen .
Vor allem werden die Programmierer sicher wissen wollen , ob sie es mit einem Fehler zu tun haben , der nur sporadisch oder nur auf bestimmten Computern auftritt .
Sie werden viele Details über Ihren Computer wissen wollen , um herauszufinden , worin er sich von ihrem unterscheidet .
Welche Details gewünscht werden , wird stark vom verwendeten Programm abhängen , aber auf jeden Fall sollten Sie die Versionsnummer angeben. , sowohl die Versionsnummer des Programms , als auch die Versionsnummer des Betriebssystems und wahrscheinlich die Versionsnummern von allen anderen Programmen , die mit dem Problem zu tun haben .
 Dann bin ich in die Diskette reingegangen . . .
Sich klar auszudrücken ist das Wichtigste bei einem Fehlerbericht .
Wenn die Programmierer nicht wissen , was sie meinen , hätten Sie genauso gut gar nichts sagen können .
Ich bekomme Fehlerberichte von überall her in der Welt .
Viele Berichterstatter haben nicht Englisch als Muttersprache und von diesen entschuldigen sich viele für ihr schlechtes Englisch .
Im Großen und Ganzen sind die Fehlerberichte mit den Entschuldigungen für schlechtes Englisch ziemlich klar und nützlich .
Die meisten schwammigen Fehlerberichte kommen von Englischsprachigen , die annehmen , dass ich sie schon verstehen werde , auch wenn sie keinerlei Anstrengung unternehmen , klar und genau zu schreiben .
Seien Sie genau .
Wenn man etwas auf zwei verscheiden verschiedene Arten machen kann , dann sagen Sie , wie Sie es gemacht haben .
 Ich habe es geöffnet kann heißen  Ich habe auf Öffnen geklickt oder  Ich habe STRG - O gedrückt .
Sagen Sie , was Sie taten .
Manchmals ist es wichtig .
Seien Sie geschwätzig .
Führen
Sie lieber zu viel , als zu wenig Informationen an .
Wenn Sie zu viel sagen , kann der Programmierer einiges unberücksichtigt lassen .
Wenn
Sie zu wenig sagen , muss er auf Sie zukommen und Sie ausfragen .
Einmal erhielt ich einen Fehlerbericht , bestehend aus einem einzigen Satz .
Jedes mal , wenn ich zurückfragte , bekam ich als Antwort einen weiteren einzigen Satz .
Ich brauchte mehrere Wochen , um so viel Information zu sammeln , dass es mir weiterhalf , da die Information nur satzweise eintröpfelte .
Seien Sie vorsichtig mit Pronomen .
Benutzen Sie nicht
Worte wie es oder das Fenster , wenn es nicht klar ist , was gemeint ist .
Betrachten Sie folgendes Beispiel :  Ich startete die FooApp Anwendung .
Sie brachte in einem Fenster eine Warnung .
Ich versuchte sie zu schließen und sie stürzte ab . 
Es ist nicht klar , was der Anwender zu schließen versuchte .
Versuchte er die Warnung zu schließen oder die ganze FooApp Anwendung ?
Das macht einen Unterschied .
Stattdessen könnte man schreiben  Ich startete die FooApp Anwendung , welche eine Warnung in einem Fenster brachte .
Ich versuchte die Warnung zu schließen und die FooApp Anwendung stürzte ab . 
Das ist länger und enthält Wiederholungen aber auch klarer und nicht so leicht misszuverstehen .
Lesen Sie , was Sie schreiben .
Lesen
Sie sich den Bericht selbst vor und beurteilen Sie , ob es für Sie klar ist .
Wenn Sie eine Liste von Handlungen erstellt haben , die das Fehlverhalten heraufbeschwören , so gehen Sie sie einmal selbst durch , um herauszufinden , ob Sie nicht einen Schritt vergessen haben .
Zusammenfassung
Das Hauptziel eines Fehlerberichts ist , es , den Programmierern , den Fehler mit den eigenen Augen sehen zu lassen .
Wenn sie nicht da sind und das nicht geht , so sollten Sie genaue Anweisungen geben , wie sie den Fehler hervorrufen können .
Falls das nicht klappt und die Programmierer den Fehler nicht nachvollziehen können , ist das zweite Ziel , genau zu beschreiben , was schief ging Beschreiben Sie jedes Detail .
Beschreiben Sie , was Sie sahen und auch , was Sie zu sehen erwarteten .
Schreiben Sie die Fehlermeldungen auf , insbesondere dann , wenn sie Nummern enthalten .
Wenn Ihr Computer etwas Unerwartetes tut , tun Sie nichts .
Tun
Sie überhaupt nichts , bis Sie ruhig sind und tun Sie nichts , was Sie für gefährlich halten .
Versuchen
Sie ruhig , das Problem selbst zu diagnostizieren , wenn Sie das für möglich halten , aber Sie sollten trotzdem auch immer die Symptome des Ausfalls berichten .
Geben Sie weitere Informationen heraus , wenn die Programmierer danach fragen .
Wenn sie sie nicht brauchen würden , würden sie nicht fragen .
Sie führen sich nicht absichtlich komisch auf .
Halten Sie Versionsnummern bereit , weil sie wahrscheinlich gebraucht werden .
Schreiben Sie klar .
Sagen Sie , was Sie meinen und stellen Sie sicher , dass es nicht falsch verstanden werden kann .
Und vor allem , seien Sie genau .
Programmierer mögen Genauigkeit .
Warnhinweis : Ich habe nie eine Manguste oder eine Antilope beobachtet .
Meine zoologischen Ausführungen sind möglicherweise nicht korrekt .

In light of today ’s massive bailout of our country ’s crumbling financial system , it might behoove us to take a moment to look on the bright side .
In that spirit , please take heart in this list of things that have not gone wrong under the leadership of George W. Bush .
There has n’t been a plague of truly Biblical proportions such as blood , frogs , locusts , incurable boils , etc. ( unless one counts the Jonas Brothers ) .
Most of the Baldwin brothers are no longer actively involved in making motion pictures .
America is not under A solid majority of major American cities are not underwater .
An enterprising young man can still make his fortune — selling defective equipment to the US military .
You can still get a decent cup of coffee for under $ 4.00 .
The dead have not returned to life to feast on the flesh of the living ( Note to self : double check on this !! )
US inflation rate is still lower than Zimbabwe’s .
California has not literally “ fallen into the ocean ” ( though it has burnt to a crisp a few times ) .
Vampirism is on the decline .
The Starland Vocal Band has not released a new studio album since 1980 ’s Christmas at Home .
( Note : This accomplishment is mitigated by the tragic 2007 release of Captain & Tennille ’s album The Secret of Christmas . )
A post -apocalyptic Road Warrior culture is not yet entirely dominant on America ’s rural highways .
Our country ’s human rights record is still the envy of China , Colombia , Sri Lanka , and Syria .
Americans are no longer employed overworked .
America ’s energy trading , financial services , forestry and mining industries are no longer bound up by onerous , outdated regulations and reams of government red tape .
Godzilla has been dormant since 1998 .
Canada is still our Special Little Buddy to the North .
Thanks , Canada !
We 've posted about reverse graffiti before , where street art is created by cleaning the dirt and grime from walls .
Here 's another excellent example , this time by Brazilian artist Alexandre Orion made a wall of skulls using only cleaning towels .
The cops even came and could n't do anything about it !
All is well until The Man came and hosed everything down .

An atheist bid to counter religious advertising , backed by the evolutionary theorist and anti-religion firebrand Richard Dawkins , has hit its £ 11,000 fundraising target .
The money will pay for the UK 's first " atheist bus campaign " , which see will the slogan " THERE'S PROBABLY NO GOD .
NOW STOP WORRYING AND ENJOY YOUR LIFE " carried by London buses .
The idea was proposed by the writer Adriane Sherine in June .
She charged that Bible quote advertising running at the time might frighten vulnerable people into believing .
The fundraising campaign , organised by the British Humanist Association , was aiming to raise £ 5,500 from small public donations via the website Justgiving .com .
Dawkins pledged to match that figure and at time of writing the total stands at £ 11,342 .
The organisers say the aim of the advertising campaign will be to " brighten people 's days on the way to work , help raise awareness of atheism in the UK , and hopefully encourage more people to come out as atheists .
We can also counter the religious adverts which are currently running on London buses , and help people think for themselves . "
Publicity for the controversial Christianity primer
The Alpha Course is currently running on the side of buses in the capital .
The atheists ' rearguard action is scheduled to begin in January . ®

Now , a few days after my release from jail in the wake of my trip to Gaza , I'm posting a few notes to sum things up .
First , the mission of the Free Gaza Movement to break the Israeli siegeproved a success beyond all expectations .
Our reaching Gaza and leavinghas created a free and regular channel between Gaza and the outside world .
It has done so because it has forced the Israeli government to make aclear policy declaration : that it is not occupying Gaza and therefore willnot prevent the free movement of Palestinians in and out ( at least bysea ) .
( Israel 's security concerns can easily be accommodated byinstituting a technical system of checks similar to those of other ports . )
Any attempt on the part of Israel to backtrack on this - by preventingships in the future from entering or leaving Gaza with goods andpassengers , including Palestinians - may be immediately interpreted as anassertion of control , and therefore of Occupation , opening Israel toaccountability for war crimes before international law , something Israeltries to avoid at all costs .
Gone is the obfuscation that has allowed Israel to maintain its control of the Occupied Territories withoutassuming any responsibility : from now on , Israel is either an Occupying Power accountable for its actions and policies , or Palestinians have everyright to enjoy their human right of traveling freely in and out of theircountry .
Israel can no longer have it both ways .
Not only did our twolittle boats force the Israel military and government to give way , then , they also changed fundamentally the status of Israel 's control of Gaza .
When we finally arrived in Gaza after a day and a half sail , the welcomewe received from 40,000 joyous Gazans was overwhelming and moving .
Peoplesought me out in particular , eager it seemed to speak Hebrew with anIsraeli after years of closure .
The message I received by people of allfactions during my three days there was the same :
How do we ( " we " in thesense of all of us living in their country , not just Palestinians orIsraelis ) get out of this mess ?
Where are WE going ?
The discourse was noteven political : what is the solution ; one - state , two - state , etc etc .
Itwas just common sense and straightforward , based on the assumption that wewill all continue living in the same country and this stupid conflict , with its walls and siege and violence , is bad for everybody .
Don'tIsraelis see that ?
people would ask me .
( The answer , unfortunately , is " no . "
To be honest , we Israeli Jews are theproblem .
The Palestinian years ago accepted our existence in the countryas a people and are willing to accept ANY solution -- two states , onestate , no state , whatever .
It is us who want exclusivity over the " Land ofIsrael " who cannot conceive of a single country , who cannot accept thenational presence of Palestinians ( we talk about " Arabs " in our country ) , and who have eliminated by our settlements even the possibility of thetwo - state solution in which we take 80 % of the land .
So it 's sad , trulysad , that our " enemies " want peace and co-existence ( and tell me that inHEBREW ) and we do n't .
Yeah , we Israeli Jews want " peace , " but in themeantime what we have -- almost no attacks , a feeling of security , a" disappeared " Palestinian people , a booming economy , tourism andever - improving international status -- seems just fine .
If " peace " meansgiving up settlements , land and control , why do it ?
What 's wrong with thestatus quo ?
If it 's not broken , do n't fix it . )
When in Gaza I also managed to see old friends , especially Eyad al - Sarrajof the Gaza Community Mental Health Program and Raji Sourani , Director ofthe Palestinian Center for Human Rights , whom I visited in his office .
Ialso received honorary Palestinian citizenship , including a passport , which was very meaningful to me as an Israeli Jew .
When I was in Gaza everyone in Israel -- including the media whointerviewed me -- warned me to be careful , to watch out for my life .
Are n't you scared ?
they asked .
Well , the only time I felt genuine andpalpable fear during the entire journey was when I got back to Israel .
Iwent from Gaza through the Erez checkpoint because I wanted to make thepoint that the siege is not only by sea .
On the Israeli side I wasimmediately arrested , charged with violating a military order prohibiting Israelis from being in Gaza and jailed at the Shikma prison in Ashkelon .
In my cell that night , someone recognized from the news .
All night I wasphysically threatened by right - wing Israelis -- and I was sure I would n ' tmake it till the morning .
Ironically , there were three Palestinians in mycell who kind of protected me , so the danger was from Israelis , notPalestinians , in Gaza as well as in Israel .
( One Palestinian from Hebronwas in jail for being illegally in Israel ; I was in jail for beingillegally in Palestine . )
As it stands , I 'm out on bail .
The state willprobably press charges in the next few weeks , and I could be jailed fortwo or so months .
I now am a Palestinian in every sense of the word : OnMonday I received my Palestinian citizenship , on Tuesday I was already inan Israeli jail .
Though the operation was a complete success , the siege will only begenuinely broken if we keep up the movement in and out of Gaza .
The boatsare scheduled to return in 2 - 4 weeks and I am now working on getting aboat - load of Israelis .
My only frustration with what was undoubtedly a successful operation waswith the fact that Israelis just do n't get it - and do n't want to get it .
The implications of our being the strong party and the fact that the Palestinians are the ones truly seeking peace are too threatening to theirhegemony and self - perceived innocence .
What I encountered in perhaps adozen interviews - and what I read about myself and our trip written by " journalists " who never even attempted to speak to me or the others - wasa collective image of Gaza , the Palestinians and our interminableconflict which could only be described as fantasy .
Rather than inquireabout my experiences , motives or views , my interviewers , especially on themainstream radio , spent their time forcing upon me their slogans anduniformed prejudices , as if giving me a space to explain myself deal adeath blow to their tightly - held conceptions .
Ben Dror Yemini of the popular Ma'ariv newspaper called us a " sataniccult . "
Another suggested that a prominent contributor to the Free GazaMovement was a Palestinian - American who had been questioned by the FBI , asif that had to do with anything ( the innuendo being we were supported , perhaps even manipulated or worse , by " terrorists " ) .
Others were moreexplicit :
Was n't it true that we were giving Hamas a PR victory ?
Why was Isiding with Palestinian fishermen - gun smugglers against my own countrywhich sought only to protect its citizens ?
Some simply yelled at me , likean interviewer on Arutz 99 .
And when all else failed , my interlocutorscould always fall back on good old cynicism :
Peace is impossible .
Jews and Arabs are different species .
You can't trust " them . "
Or bald assertions : They just want to destroy us .
Then there 's the paternalism :
Well , I guessit 's good to have a few idealists like you around ... Nowhere in the many interviews was there a genuine curiosity about what Iwas doing or what life was like in Gaza .
No one interested in a differentperspective , especially if it challenged their cherished slogans .
No onegoing beyond the old , tired slogans .
Plenty of reference , though , toterrorism , Qassam missiles and Palestinian snubbing our valiant efforts tomake peace ; none whatsoever to occupation , house demolitions , siege , landexpropriation or settlement expansion , not to mention the killing , imprisoning and impoverishment of their civilian population .
As if we hadnothing to do with the conflict , as if we were just living our normal , innocent lives and bad people decided to throw Qassam rockets .
Above all , no sense of our responsibility , or any willingness to acceptresponsibility for the ongoing violence and conflict .
Instead just athoughtless , automatic appeal to an image of Gaza and " Arabs " ( we don'tgenerally use the term " Palestinians " ) that is diametrically opposed towhat I 've seen and experienced , a slavish repeating of mindless ( andwrong ) slogans which serve only to eliminate any possibility of trulygrasping the situation .
In short , a fantasy Gaza as perceived from withina bubble carefully constructed so as to deflect any uncomfortable reality .
The greatest insight this trip has given me is understanding why Israelisdo n't " get it : " a media comprised by people who should know better but whopossess little critical ability and feel more comfortable inside a boxcreated by self - serving politicians than in trying to do something farmore creative : understanding what in the hell is going on here .
Still , I formulated clearly my messages to my fellow Israelis , and thatconstitutes the main content of my interviews and talks :
(1) Despite what our political leaders say , there is a politicalsolution to the conflict and there are partners for peace .
If anything , weof the peace movement must not allow the powers - that - be to mystify theconflict , to present it as a " clash of civilizations . "
The Israeli-Palestinian conflict is political and as such it has a politicalsolution ;( 2 ) The Palestinians are not our enemies .
In fact , I urge my fellowIsraeli Jews to disassociate from the dead - end politics of our failedpolitical leaders by declaring , in concert with Israeli and Palestinianpeace - makers :
We refuse to be enemies .
And (3 ) As the infinitely stronger party in the conflict and the onlyOccupying Power , we Israelis must accept responsibility for our failed andoppressive policies .
Only we can end the conflict .
Let me end by expressing my appreciation to the organizers of thisinitiative - Paul Larudee and Greta Berlin from the US , Hilary Smith and Bella from the UK , Vaggelis Pissias , a Greek member of the team whoprovided crucial material and political input , and Jamal al - Khoudri , anindependent member of the PLC from Gaza and head of the Popular Committee Against the Siege and others - plus the wonderful group of participants onthe boats and the great communication team that stayed ashore .
Specialappreciation goes to ICAHD 's own Angela Godfrey - Goldstein who played acrucial role in Cyprus and Jerusalem in getting the word out .
Not toforget our hosts in Gaza ( whose names are on the Free Gaza website ) and the tens of thousands of Gazans who welcomed us and shared their liveswith us .
May our peoples finally find the peace and justice they deservein our common land .----- Jeff Halper is the Director of the Israeli Committee Against HouseDemolitions ( ICAHD ) .

Savvas Othon , technical director at Rentokil , said : " The short turnaround times for planes and other forms of transport means they are sometimes not inspected as thoroughly as they used to be .
What should happen is a good vacuum around the back of seats and in the creases of seats .
Any small gap is ideal for a bedbug , which can go for quite some time without a meal . "
The implication being that McCain ’s campaign manager , Rick Davis , was being paid money in order to keep him happy until McCain became president , and then Fannie and Freddie could call in favors .
I ’m sorry , but , if true , this story is corrupt as hell .
It goes far beyond lobbying .
We are talking about potentially buying someone off .
And buying them off in order to buy John McCain :
But neither the Times story — nor the McCain campaign — revealed that Davis ’s lobbying firm , Davis Manafort , based in Washington , D.C. , continued to receive $ 15,000 a month from Freddie Mac until last month — long after the Homeownership Alliance had been terminated .
The two sources , who requested anonymity discussing sensitive information , told NEWSWEEK that Davis himself approached Freddie Mac in 2006 and asked for a new consulting arrangement that would allow his firm to continue to be paid .
The arrangement was approved by Hollis McLoughlin , Freddie Mac ’s senior vice president for external relations , because “ he [ Davis ] was John McCain ’s campaign manager and it was felt you could n’t say no , ” said one of the sources .
[ McLoughlin did not return phone calls ] .
When asked about his own campaign manager ’s associations with the mortgage giants , McCain , in an interview with CNBC Sunday night , said that Davis “ has had nothing to do ” with the Homeownship Alliance since it disbanded and “ I ’ll be glad to have his record examined by anybody who wants to look at it . ”
( The Homeownership Alliance was set up and funded by both Freddie Mac and Fannie Mae to promote the goal of home ownership and counter efforts to impose tighter regulations on the two federally sponsored entities . )
Davis , in a conference call arranged by the McCain campaign on Monday , said “ it ’s been over three years since there ’s been any activity in this area and since I had any contact with those folks . ”
[ NOTE FROM JOHN : 3 years would be October 2005 – this article says that ’s a lie . ]
Davis also said he “ had a severed leave of absence ” from his lobbying and consulting firm , and “ I ’ve taken no compensation from my firm for 18 months . ”
( A campaign spokesman said that Davis receives no partnership distribution under his arrangement ) .
It is not unusual for major corporations to enter into consulting retainers so that individuals could be available if needed .
And the two sources stressed that Davis at no time made any threats or demands on Freddie Mac .
But the sources indicated that Freddie Mac seldom called on Davis or the firm .
On one occasion , Davis was asked to attend a meeting of the firm ’s political action committee during the 2006 campaign in order to give the Republican Party ’s perspective on the upcoming elections .
In addition , Davis did meet with McLoughlin for breakfast on “ one or two ” occasions .
Other than that , one source said , Davis “ does n’t do anything ” for Freddie Mac .
The firm “ does n’t even talk to him . ”
In addition , Freddie Mac has had no contact with Davis Manafort other than receiving monthly invoices from the firm and paying them .
But the money could be perceived as helping Freddie Mac ensure a good relationship with one of McCain ’s top aides in the event that he became president .
Shares in the troubled bank HBOS are up and down like a manic - depressive .
It is tempting to assume that the brokers doing the buying and selling are every bit as febrile .
Indeed , a study of 26 successful New York brokers from 2000 does suggest they are distinctly flaky .
They had high levels of depersonalisation ( feeling detached from one 's surroundings ) and a staggering two - thirds were depressed .
There were similarly high levels of anxiety and sleeplessness .
The more they earned , the more likely they were to have these problems .
Twice daily , they consumed both alcohol and an illegal substance ( mostly cocaine ) .
For relaxation , they chose solitary pursuits : jogging , masturbation and fishing were common .
But for all their Affluenza - driven compulsions and misery , it would be wrong to characterise brokers ' turbulent share - dealing as evidence of mental instability .
In fact , it is a wholly rational response to the way they are incentivised .
In the deregulated shambles of our financial services industry , their bosses motivate them with extremely short - term rewards .
If the only way to succeed in the system is to slap a bet on HBOS shares falling , then it is rational to do so .
Even if it is true that HBOS is not as close to insolvency as was the case with Northern Rock , it is still rational for brokers to make these bets once the predatory herd have got an institution in their sights - the more people believe that it is going down , the more they bet on it happening , the more likely it is to happen .
Much more interesting , psychopathologically , is how the brainboxes in charge of the system allowed it to get like this .
You could not accuse the likes of Keith Joseph , Nigel Lawson and Gordon Brown of being thick .
Yet we have many financial institutions that exist through lending borrowed money , rather than their own .
How could they allow a system in which many of the financial institutions were living on the never - never ?
Even at the individual level , we have been coerced into spending more than we earn .
Whatever happened to Thatcher 's pious homilies about householders having to balance their books ?
If the current stock market rollercoaster symbolises lunacy , it resides in those who set up and monitor the system , not the individual money - chasing traders wanting a larger second home .
In what seems like a battle of ants in a case full of lions , Practical Technology has learned that Xandros has bought Linspire .
“ In an announcement that was sent out today , June 30 , to Linspire stockholders , CEO Larry Kettler wrote that the stockholders had decided to sell all of Linspire ’s assets .
This deal specifically includes Linspire , Freespire , and the company ’s distribution agnostic CNR ( Click ‘ N Run ) desktop installation platform . ”
Not everyone is very happy with this one , though .
Kevin Carmony , the former CEO of Linspire , is quite direct about the news on his blog .
In classic Michael Robertson [ Linspire ’s founder and chief owner ] form , he has once again completely disregarded the 100 some - odd shareholders of Linspire by pulling off this deal without a shareholder meeting .
Most states require shareholder approval of any merger or reorganization of a corporation , or the sale or transfer of all or substantially all of the corporation ’s assets .
Even if a company only has 1 minority shareholder , there should be a shareholder meeting and the acquisition explained to all shareholders .
What do Linspire shareholders get in place of a shareholder meeting ?
This completely worthless notice in the mail .
This will end up being a completely insignificant event for Linspire shareholders , and the end for Linspire customers .
I predict this was done to : 1 ) help Robertson drain the company of its cash and resources .
When I left Linspire , we had a very profitable year and the company had millions in the bank .
I predict Robertson has moved this money to himself , family , and his other companies , leaving Linspire ’s minority shareholders with nothing .
2 ) help Robertson save face by issuing a â€ œLinspire Acquired by Xandros ! â€ press release , instead of living with the public humiliation that Linspire failed under his leadership .
Such a press release will of course be meaningless , unless the acquisition was substantial .
As a shareholder , I will eventually find out .
3 ) Give Xandros ( also seemingly on life support ) a press release , and perhaps some way for them to spin this to investors to raise money .
To me , I ’m not really sure if I really even care – in fact , I ’d be surprised to see many of you care at all .
Xandros and Linspire seem to have added little to the Linux desktop world in the end , and while both of them had a few strong points , they were in the end eclipsed by Ubuntu , Fedora , and OpenSUSE .
While Xandros may have made some good press by coming pre-installed on Asus ’ EeePC , it did n’t give them a truly massive boost in revenue stream .
“ The company is not making money hand over fist it has been realizing â€œa very nice revenue stream from its Asus systems ” . ”
All I have to say : feel free to wow me .
プエラリアジェルはどのくらいで効果が実感できる
プエラリアと言えば、やはりサプリメントのイメージが強いですが、皆さんはどんなタイプの製品をお求めですか。
最近は美容への効果からプエラリアのユニークな製品が多く登場しています。
サプリメント以外の方法で美容を模索している人には、是非注目していただきたいのです。
では一体サプリメント以外にどんな製品に注目が集まっているのでしょうか。
今多くのモデルやグラビアアイドルの間で、「バストアップに効果がある」とされ人気があるのは、「ジェル」の製品です。
つまり、飲むのではなく塗るタイプの製品で、コスメとしてプエラリアが注目されています。
ではどのように使えば効果的なのでしょうか。
プエラリアは飲むことで効果が高まるイメージがありますが、塗って肌から浸透させることも出来ます。
バストアップに効果的なマッサージをしながら、塗り込むことで女性ホルモンの刺激がバストに直接伝わります。
マッサージをしながらバストを大きくすることが出来るので、日々のケアに加えてみてはいかがでしょうか。
もしもマッサージを行う場合は、湯上りなど血行が良い状態のときがおススメです。
血行が良いとバストを大きくする作用のあるリンパの流れも促進されます。
しかし、ジェルを使用される場合には注意も必要です。
併用上の注意点はサプリメントとの併用です。
もしもあなたがすでにプエラリアのサプリメントを使用している場合には、ジェルとの併用を行い更なる効果を得ようと考えているかもしれません。
しかし、併用は女性ホルモンを刺激する成分の摂り過ぎになる可能性があります。
そこで、模試も併用する際にはサプリメントの摂取量を減らすなどの工夫を行いましょう。
成分をたくさん摂取すれば効果が高まるものではありません。
寧ろ健康を乱す可能性は否定できないのです。
女性ホルモンを多量に摂取し刺激になると、不正出血などの恐れがあります。
適量の表示は１製品ごとに掲載されているので、この限度を併用で超えないように配慮し使いましょう。
IT IS difficult being a short - seller .
Most shareholders and managers agree that you are an important part of an efficient stockmarket — until you dump shares in their company .
Then things can turn nasty .
“ We appreciate that , asshole , ” barked Enron 's chief executive , on a public conference call , to a suspected short - seller who had complained about the lack of a published balance sheet .
Sometimes bears need even thicker skins .
In 1995 Malaysia 's finance ministry reportedly proposed caning as a punishment for abusive shorting .
Since markets turned sour last year , plenty of financial firms , from Bear Stearns and Lehman Brothers in America , to Babcock & Brown and Macquarie Group in Australia , have seen increased shorting .
A few have grumbled about unfair speculation .
In February MBIA , an embattled bond insurer , complained to a congressional committee that “ self - interested parties have gone to substantial effort to undermine the market confidence that is critical to MBIA 's business ” .
Yet the regulatory response was muted until Britain 's Financial Services Authority ( FSA ) , a City watchdog , abruptly announced new disclosure rules for anyone short - selling the stock of companies in the delicate process of issuing shares to raise capital .
If market abuse does not stop with this new regime , due to come into force from June 20th , the FSA will take further steps .
Since it intervened , British banks raising emergency capital have seen their shares rise .
A reaction against short - selling often follows big stockmarket declines .
Congress held hearings in the United States after the crashes of 1929 and 1987 , some Asian governments imposed restrictions after the regional crisis in the late 1990s , and America 's Securities and Exchange Commission ( SEC ) , the FSA and other national regulators investigated allegations of abuse after September 11th , 2001 .
However , since the 1970s the best - known official studies in the West have shown that short - selling is broadly a force for good , aiding price discovery and preventing shares from becoming overvalued .
That conclusion is supported by academic research .
After examining the run-up to the crash of 1929 , Owen Lamont of Yale University and DKR Fusion , a hedge fund , found that the more investors wished to short - sell a stock , the more overvalued it proved to be .
In another study of American firms since the late 1970s , Mr Owen found that companies that attack short - sellers , with belligerent statements or harsher tactics , are likely to go on to underperform the wider market .
In reality , short - selling is far from being financial black magic .
It is a difficult strategy to pull off , because in the long run stockmarkets tend to rise .
It is also a minority activity : only 4.3 % of shares on the New York Stock Exchange had been sold short at the end of May ( see chart ) .
Data for London are less transparent , but the best proxy is the level of shares being lent ( to bet on a share price falling , short - sellers often borrow stock and then sell it ) .
According to Data Explorers , a research firm , only 4.5 % of the FTSE 100 index 's value is out on loan .
Many short sales are innocuous attempts to hedge other positions .
Unlike going long , actively betting against a share price involves red tape and runs the risk of unlimited losses ( since a share price can , in theory , rise for ever , whereas it cannot fall below zero ) .
The best bears , says Jim Chanos , of Kynikos Associates , the world 's biggest short fund , are not bullies but “ financial detectives ” , scrutinising companies .
The short - seller that infuriated MBIA 's management , William Ackman of Pershing Square Capital Management , was certainly vocal , but nobody doubted that he had done his homework .
If short - selling is generally beneficial , does it face hurdles ?
America introduced the “ uptick rule ” in 1938 , aiming to act as a “ circuit - breaker ” by forcing short - sellers to execute above the price level of the last reported market trade .
It has recently scrapped this rule , which short - sellers argue was largely symbolic , and it remains in place at only a few of the world 's big stock exchanges .
Both the SEC and Australian regulators are examining “ naked short ” positions , in which a fund sells shares it has not yet got in its hands , gambling that it can borrow some before the trade is settled .
Still , regulators ' concerns about naked shorting mainly reflect the risk to settlement , rather than to the integrity of large companies ' share prices .
Finally , almost all countries ( although not Britain ) require aggregate short positions in individual stocks to be disclosed .
None of these restrictions impose a really onerous burden on short - sellers .
Compared with them , the FSA 's intervention is heavy handed .
Forcing funds to disclose short positions if they exceed 0.25 % of the capital of a company in a rights issue is far more stringent than the obligations long positions face — and probably bureaucratic too .
But it is the FSA 's threat to “ take further measures ” if need be by , say , limiting stock lending during rights issues , that has really spooked short - sellers .
The regulator says that “ market abuse ” may have driven the share prices of banks near or below the offer price for new shares , putting pressure on the underwriters of the rights issues to buy the new stock .
Yet market abuse , which the FSA has defined as including insider trading , spreading false information , or deliberately distorting share prices , is usually pursued by prosecuting offenders , not restricting types of activity .
And although short - selling was certainly taking place in London , the FSA has yet to show that the level of activity was great enough to dominate trading and thus distort the banks ' share prices .
Data Explorers estimates that the stock on loan for HBOS , a big British bank , has been fairly constant at about 7 % of its market value since it announced its rights issue .
All of which suggests that the FSA wanted to ensure banks can successfully raise capital .
That is a worthy objective — assuming those banks are solvent — but it may have been better done by other means .
The banks could have issued new shares at a bigger discount without , at least in theory , damaging their shareholders .
And the underwriters could have stepped up to the plate .
The FSA says its measures are temporary , and promises to conduct a review with the Treasury .
But the episode has a familiar ring .
Once again short - sellers have found that their business is permitted and even lauded by regulators — until prices fall and the blame game begins .
How about Bug in their Website ?!

The press release reads : " After a new major version of Spring is released , community maintenance updates will be issued for three months to address initial stability issues .
Subsequent maintenance releases will be available to SpringSource Enterprise customers . "
I think this is disgraceful .
This is an open source product , built , improved and used by the community .
It is distributed under the Apache license , version 2.0 , which reads " 2. Grant of Copyright License .
Subject to the terms and conditions of this License , each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual , worldwide , non-exclusive , no -charge , royalty - free , irrevocable copyright license to reproduce , prepare Derivative Works of , publicly display , publicly perform , sublicense , and distribute the Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form . "
It also states : " 4 . Redistribution .
You may reproduce and distribute copies of the Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium , with or without modifications , and in Source or Object form , ... "
So , I dont see how they can make this work , both legally and practically .
Their updated sources will be available in public source repositories and it seems unlikely that they can prevent anyone from legally publishing any of those " commercial patches " to the community .
However , the license also states " You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and may provide additional or different license terms and conditions for use , reproduction , or distribution of Your modifications , or for any such Derivative Works as a whole , provided Your use , reproduction , and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with the conditions stated in this License . "
I guess a patch could be considered a derivative work , even though that is stretching the term a little .
Not sure how the jurisprudence on this is .
It is certainly stretching the spirit of the license beyond breaking point .
But it is clear that all those who are betting their applications and companies on Spring and therefore it 's open source nature , have now gotten a head 's up that this may be a mistake .
The greedy boys have come to town !

You 're right ...
If EJB had n't sucked mightily , there would have been no Spring .
Now that EJB sucks less mightily , does that remove the case for Spring ?
Not so much .
I would agree with you if you said " does that remove the case for IOC containers ? " .
If you use Spring as an IOC container , you can achieve the same with another , eventually adding some AOP code ( e.g. transaction management when the new IOC container does not support this ) .
If you are using the large amount of ( imho useless ) classes Spring provides , then you have fallen in what Rod hoped : a nice vendor lock - in that now he wants you to pay .

in response to Vitaliy Semochkin Sounds like they 're encouraging everyone to try Seam .
For what reason ?
Seam is about EJB and JSF - both technologies are useless .
This is an example of a real troll !.
Go and do your homework and check what is EJB3 and specially 3.1 .
As the other commenter said without EJB Spring did n't born .
I read somewhere that Rod Johnson it is giving advice to the EJB expert group for the next release .
Spring 2.5 got the annotations to be compatible with EJB and even Rod encourage to use the compatible annotations .
EJB and appserver got profiles that is also another thing Rod is agree and happy the expert group got right , even there is an article that Rod Johnson said JEE 6 is in the right direction .
Sorry I dont have the links at hand but you can google them and find it easy .
Regards .

in response to Skandar De Anaya Sounds like they 're encouraging everyone to try Seam .
For what reason ?
Seam is about EJB and JSF - both technologies are useless .
As the other commenter said without EJB Spring did n't born .
Yeap , without EJB the book J2EE without EJB would n't appear ;-)
I read somewhere that Rod Johnson it is giving advice to the EJB expert group for the next release .
Maybe he wants to create STANDARD BASED framework that WORKS ?
Or maybe he wants a stamp ( STANDARD BASED ) on it's own project to get more money ( why should I or you care ) ?
Spring 2.5 got the annotations to be compatible with EJB and even Rod encourage to use the compatible annotations .
Compatible for DI .
Have you ever tried Spring for real ?
I 've never heard that someone from Spring team encouraging to use either EJB or JSF .
Both EJB and JSF are an perfect example of overengineering .
With complex life cycle and lots of technology evangelists dancing around to sell it .

Or maybe he wants to be part of the next Standard as you said why we should care but I care that EJB3.1 it will be smooth to work with and it is a JCP standard neutral of implementers .
Compatible for DI .

Yes I mean compatible for the DI and I only use right now the Spring DI .
I didnt mean to encourage to use EJB or JSF I mean just the annotations as JSR - 250 and EJB 3 annotations JSR - 220 as : @ Resource @PostConstruct @ PreDestroy

in response to Skandar De Anaya Conclusion , IMHO I was happy to work with Spring DI but this is it ,
It also happened to me at when Redhat 9 was a desktop OS and Redhat changed the game and went with subscriptions and maybe this is the way for open source projects to make business but for my projects and my customers we are small to medium business this is not a good move and even I do n't trust anymore what it will be next with SpringSource but if really I have to use Spring I will pay for the Enterprise subscription if not I will go to the standard with EJB3.1 when is available and as I said the code is decoupled , it 's not a big deal to move from one DI container to other or back again to Spring .
SpringSource wants to do their business good choice is their choice and with the open source model and Good luck , maybe in the future I will be a " Enterprise Spring " subscriber of Spring Source or maybe not .
Best Regards .

The world is n't black / white .
From first hand experience , many users of open source projects are free loaders , who never contribute a line of code .
I can understand why spring and redhat do what they do , even if I do n't necessarily agree with the approach .
those who have never contributed code to a project and then complain the access to the software is getting expensive should suck it up and pay for a subscription .
Many OSS developer do it out of love of coding , and want to do it for a living .
I 'm not one of those , but they should have the freedom to do that .
Plus , the code is there .
If you need a patch urgently , then patch it yourself or pay for it .
for those who contribute to a project and do n't like paying for a subscription , it sucks a bit .
There 's all kinds of open source .

There are many ways to contribute : by committing code , testing and reporting bugs , writing documentation , providing help in forums , writing plugins etc .
The fact that a person does not directly code the software does n't mean he / she does n't help the project and can be considered as a member in the community .
If the only people who contribute code would have a moral legitimation to get the software for free , then open source would be meaningless - it would be like writing a proprietary code inside your own company which is to be used only for your products .
That 's what the " open " in open source is all about .
I do agree that customers who want enterprise - level support should pay for it , but withholding code which exists ( and possibly was written by a member of the community ) from the community is not the right thing to do in my opinion .

What the maintenance policy will mean to you :
For the open source community :
If you are happy to track the latest major release of Spring ( e.g. 3.0 , 3.1 or 4.0 ) , all fixes go into the next major release .
You get all the latest features and up - to - date fixes -- what you would expect from any healthy open source project .
For enterprise production users :
If you are an enterprise customer that cannot or will not regularly upgrade to the latest release -- that is , your use of open source differs from normal open source culture of following the latest release -- you can subscribe to our SpringSource Enterprise products .
By doing this you help to ensure that innovation continues to be available to the community .
Given that such customers have little tolerance for risk , running open source in the core of their applications without support makes no sense anyway .
As the number of versions of Spring used in production grows , it is impossible for us to provide free maintenance for multiple releases and perform backports of issues .
Doing so would unfairly subsidize conservative customers who want to remain on a previous version , at the cost of the open source community .
SpringSource contributes a huge and growing amount of open source to the community .
Check out the around one hundred releases this year across the many open source projects we are involved in .
Providing a clear maintenance policy will ensure that we can continue to do so .

This is a good point , and understandable .
It 's something I 've seen with at least one client already ( who ironically went to a third - party -- not SpringSource -- for support with Spring ) .

in response to Rod Johnson Rod , I do n't have a problem with you not supporting older releases for free .
I prefer to use the latest and greatest .
What I do have a problem with is charging for access to the minor releases ( or the bug fixes therein ) that occur 3 months after the major release .
As someone pointed our earlier on this thread , 2.5 was released on 2007 - 11 - 19 so presumably under this new policy releases 2.5.3 onwards would not be freely available .
IMHO this is not what Spring has been about for all of these years .
A key attribute of an open - source product is the willingness and ability of the project 's committers to quickly make fixes freely available .
It 's disappointing that the corporate desire for profit has led to this switch to this pseudo open - source model .

It seems to me that the policy wording does not match what Rod said .
The policy says : " After a new major version of Spring is released , community maintenance updates will be issued for three months to address initial stability issues .
Subsequent maintenance releases will be available to SpringSource Enterprise customers . "
I believe that to match Rod 's clarification it should say the following instead : " After a new major version of Spring is released , community maintenance updates to the previous version will be issued for three months .
Subsequent maintenance releases to all versions except the current release will be available to SpringSource Enterprise customers . "

Rod Johnson , Spring Founder & CEO , SpringSource Rod , I personally would like the following to be clarified instead : - How will SpringSource manage the inclusion of commercial - license fixes into the publicly available one , without affecting the license , right to redistribute , etc. - How will Spring users be reassured that no license changes will occur , such to require licenses to be purchased in order to use Spring within their own applications ; -
If and how the license is preventing the community from forking the Spring framework project .

Thanks for the clarification Rod , As I wrote earlier I completely agree with the logic that commercial costumers who refuse to upgrade to the newest major releases should n't cause SpringSource to consume resources to provide support for them for free at the expanse of writing the next major release .
However I think there is a better way to implement this .
If three months after a major release a new bug is found but the next major release is not finished , the community will be stuck with a knows bug and a fix which is available only to paying costumers .
Instead I suggest this alternative policy : minor releases will be available to the community exactly until the next major release , be it a week or a year .
This way no one will be in danger of being left with no fix to a bug at any time and everyone stays happy .

This is not a clarification if you not at the same time provide a policy for major releases .
This could mean that a non-enterprise customer finds a serious bug after the initial 3 months , reports it , you fix it and supply it to your enterprise customers , and the guy that discovered it has to wait for months to get a new version , unless he is willing to track svn and backport and compile himself .

So if I understand the debate correctly , the best way to defuse the argument would be to distribute the head point releases to everyone , and to restrict previous version point releases to enterprise subscribers for the agreed three years .
So we can all look forward to 3.0.x , but only subscribers will be able to look forward to 2.5.9 or 1.3.8 ( or is that branch outside the maintenance scope ? ) .
I 'm also a bit confused about bugs fixes not being publicly available - is there more than one repository ?
One public and one SpringSource internal ?

So it means for example SS Release Spring Framework 2.6 , SS will bug fix until 3 month pass then they will put the code in the source tree open for anybody to pickup and continue the bug fixing and washing their clothes ?.
Hmm sounds ok but why no better we fork the code and make Summer or Autumn ID container and without a Consulting " proprietary / OSS " behind it .
As someone said Spring DI container is not rocket science perhaps we could use already Guice or soon EJB3.1 .
I suggest , people lets move on , I was a supported and fan of Spring until today , The people that continue to drink the kool - aid good luck but all your contributions will be for SS gain .

Since this question gets to one of the core issues , I thought it worth going into more detail .
There 's a lot of overreaction on this thread .
This policy does not hurt the open source community .
By open source community , I mean those folk who are happy to follow source repository activity , compile open source code and perhaps contribute .
Obviously no one who does n't do the first two activities can do the third in any useful way .
SpringSource continues to expose our open source code , which costs us millions of dollars annually to develop .
This policy does affect users who think that open source is a way for them to get extended maintenance of high quality enterprise software for free , without them lifting a finger .
These are typically companies who can't or wo n't upgrade to the current version of Spring - - in contrast to the typical open source culture of following the latest and greatest release .
These folk will still get the latest versions of Spring -- and furthermore , typically are enterprises of a scale and risk profile that they are happy to pay for rock solid support .
From their point of view , the availability of 3 year support from SpringSource is a good thing , and a strong argument in favor of using Spring , rather than a problem .
Frankly , anyone who refuses to compile an open source project under any circumstances does n't really believe in open source : they believe in other people working for them for free .
We 're proud of the huge contribution we make to open source -- not merely in Spring projects , but in Tomcat , Apache HTTPD and many other projects .
Anyone who really cares about open source should be willing to read and compile code , or pay for those who create open source to do it for them .
Folks who are n't willing to do this can complain , but I have little sympathy for them .

I do n't know about you , but most of us expects the " latest and greatest release " to be a official jar with a specific version , not a snapshot from what the current trunk might look like at the time the bugfix is merged into it .
How can the " open source culture " get this release if no new releases will be made after the initial 3 months ?
All I ask for is to always make the latest release from the current major version of Spring available as official jar from SpringSource .

This move just seems so incredibly counterproductive in every way .
You 're putting giant unknowns in the path of 90 % of the people who , while not paying you anything , are the actual reason anyone would consider paying for a Spring license , or renewing their subscription some years from now .
Money is n't a problem .

in response to Rod Johnson Rod I think I 'm one of many people who use Spring for nothing but simple DI .
The value increase of Spring over the last few years was not by Spring itself but by other frameworks who supported Spring by allowing a Spring based configuration ( ActiveMQ , Mule , Camel etc . )
The only newish feature of Spring itself that made a difference to me was Namespaces .
And this only because it made the above nicer to configure .
I 've choosen Spring because I did NOT want an enterprise product but a lightweight alternative to configure my apps .
A few questions therfore :
Do you believe it 's reasonable to have to pay a subscription for a simple DI container ?
Should I rather than use the latest and greatest version and risk unfixed issues try to stay with the boldest and oldest version which still had all the fixes put into it 's branch ?
How much of your profit will be shared with these frameworks like Camel and co that made me choose Spring over and over again rather than alternative DI containers ?
Where do you think your , by now , ubiquitous DI container exceeds other ubiquitous libraries such as the Apache commons ones ?
Or should I have to take out for every software product going forward at least 20 - 30 different support contracts ?
I understand that you want to make money , and hey - feel free to take any value adding features added to your DI container and make people pay for them .
But the value of core - spring , the DI - container , does not lie with the huge amount of complex code in it , but by us , the community , having made it the DI container of our choice .

Ingo , Spring has not been the first IOC containter and certainly wo n't be the last ( Guice , the Tapestry 5 IOC container , the old Picocontainer to name a few ) .
Should I rather than use the latest and greatest version and risk unfixed issues try to stay with the boldest and oldest version which still had all the fixes put into it 's branch ?
I personally would go for the old , stable one .
It is risk management .

I definitely agree with you , Ingo .
The only helpful feature I found in Spring was the transactional demarcation , but that 's something I can re-write myself for another container .
I totally agree that , as other people said , they are trying to monetize over adoption rather than over additional features .
But again ( I said this in another post ) that 's where the development community glaringly failed : also where the new risks lay :
1 ) The community took a framework , blessed it to the highest skies , and used it as a standard , not as a framework .
The trick here is that Spring promotes IOC and loose coupling , but using Spring as a whole means getting stick to its classes ( especially with DAO , Web Services , WebFlow , and transaction demarcation ) .
As a result Spring became pervasive where it should have freed the developers from dependencies .
It 's a bit ( not quite ) like Microsoft .
2 ) Licensing - I think that changing licensing on the run is dodgy to say the least .
Either a product is free , either it is not .
If Springsource changes mind , it can stop the project and build a new one under a different license .
The community , needless to say , may be forking from the old one .
I am sure there are people who know Spring as well as the SpringSource guys do .
3 ) This case stacks up to the list of precedents with open - source - licensed suddenly become ( semi - ) commercial .
There are many other frameworks that are good candidates - ZKK , Guice , GWT , Echo , and theoretically many others .
A community that accepts this only harms the open source adoption within the enterprise field : open source often enters being free - good - quality software , especially in the small businesses market .
Suddenly their cost estimates fail because they must cater for * mandatory * support contracts .
Are we really sure we want this ?
I am going to keep far from Spring from now on , even if they would make up their minds again over this highly debatable license .
That has become a risk , especially where budgets are tight .

Is this not the disconnect which is causing all the grief ?
It is not the openness of the code it is the price ( free ) that the vast majority of customers , sorry community , are buying ( not commercially that is ) into .
The last time I was at a TTS conference in Las Vegas we got to hear from SS ( then Interface21 ) , Alfresco , and others on how OSS significantly reduced development costs ( more like testing if you ask me ) and improved the quality of the design and code and yet Rod has just told us all that is costs " millions " , yes " millions " to develop and maintain the code base with no one outside SS is in anyway contributing .
Someone is clearly telling tales here .
Commercial OSS is only free whilst a vendor is gaining market share .
This is no different than supermarkets offering goods below cost just to entice customers into the shop and to kill off the competition .
The one big difference is that it is illegal in most countries .

The last time I was at a TTS conference in Las Vegas we got to hear from SS ( then Interface21 ) , Alfresco , and others on how OSS significantly reduced development costs ( more like testing if you ask me ) and improved the quality of the design and code and yet Rod has just told us all that is costs " millions " , yes " millions " to develop and maintain the code base with no one outside SS is in anyway contributing .
Someone is clearly telling tales here .
Commercial OSS is only free whilst a vendor is gaining market share .
This is no different than supermarkets offering goods below cost just to entice customers into the shop and to kill off the competition .
The one big difference is that it is illegal in most countries .
http://www.competitionbureau.gc.ca/epic/site/cb-bc.nsf/en/01729e.html " .... while the Act encourages vigorous price competition , it also ensures that marketplace transactions are conducted on the basis of fair , competitive rivalry rather than through anti-competitive behaviour .
Unreasonably low pricing is one example of such behaviour .
It means involvement in a policy of selling below cost in order to deter entry into a market , or to force competitors out of a market .
While consumers may benefit from the resulting low prices for a brief period , they can be harmed in the long - run if the low pricing leads to diminished competition and , ultimately , higher prices or reduced levels of service , product quality or innovation . "
It is even worse for the consumer when there is no standard i.e. more than implementation of a runtime or API .

in response to William Louth I like the Spring Framework .
I was ambivalent for a long time , even though its strengths were clear , because I thought ( and continue to think ) their stance towards Java EE is political rather than real , and I was n't sure that configuration in XML ( the Spring way , back in 1.0 , 2.0 ) was really that much better than configuration in XML ( the J2EE way . )
Sure , it was a lot easier to declare dependencies on instances in Spring compared to J2EE , but then again , J2EE 's dependencies were always intended to be " heavier " than Spring 's , and that seemed obvious : when your opponent is trying to solve problem A , saying " but they do n't solve problem B , which we do " seems ... underhanded .
But ... with Spring 2.5 , the gates opened .
Namespaces and annotations - particularly annotations - made everything all right .
I finally swallowed the ... whichever pill it is that made me believe ( sorry , I did n't like The Matrix ) , and dove in .
Spring 's now a standard library for my projects .
The reason the license change bothers me so much is not the specific change .
It bothers me because Spring has done a good job embedding itself in successful projects , and now they 've shown that they 're willing to change the license .
Customers who buy our application server are going to be using Spring , because we leverage the heck out of it .
Now they 're forced ( for all intents and purposes ) to buy a Spring license , too .
Chances are , they already do this , but that was their choice .
How do we know Spring 's not going to change their license again to something actually onerous , and not just annoying like this one is ?
Answer : we do n't .
Just like a man who 's had an affair can never be trusted the same way again , Spring 's jilting us - even in a minor way - and we can never trust them like we did .
Thanks , SpringSource .
I 've appreciated everything you 've done , even from afar - and yes , I know , you 've held my " not - a - fanboi " stance against me - but now I feel like I was right for listening to my gut feelings .
I 'm checking out Guice .
If the transaction management stuff is easy enough , we can switch it in as an alternative to Spring .
( Also posted on my blog ... )
I 'm all for SpringSource or anyone else making money .
I do n't even mind this , not too much , but it 's .. weird .
It reminds me of Red Hat .
They used to have a free version , then monetized , and now they have the redheaded stepchild , Fedora , and the " real version , " Red Hat .
People who used Red Hat before the commercial version got screwed ... and started using Debian ( and now , Ubuntu , or in my case , Solaris ) or bought the subscription .
This is not that big of a deal , except psychologically , and it's a huge warning for companies that leverage Spring .
Like mine .
Let 's be clear here : .

in response to William Louth Hi Joseph ,
You and your company would not be so peeved if you had given risk management much more than lip service .
Hint : open standard versus open source code ?
I suspect there would have been more external contributions than there is currently .
Errrr .... what ?
My company is n't peeved at all .
That was me speaking as myself .
I do not think Spring is a " bad bet " in any way .
My company 's integration of Spring is merely a part of our product line , not a core aspect ; you can get every benefit of the product without touching Spring .

in response to Joseph Ottinger Sorry for many comments but this is disappointed but I suggest for the people that just use the DI container your code is decoupled so move to another framework right now as OpenEJB or Guice or even Tapestry 5 DI , I 'm agree with some comments do n't fork spring , it could get a big mess with many forks .
Anyway for people that really need all the features of Spring Stack prepare your wallet , it is not disclosed even the price of the license , it could be $ 3000 US every year per developer ?
for medium to small business just for the DI it does n't make sense to pay , For medium company that use the stack it some expensive .
I think this license it 's just for fortune 500 that already got the Spring kool - aid .
This is my 2c and I 'm still really pissed , I think I 'll still pissed for weeks for this geez .

This days everything is " Enterprise " hype .
But what about small to medium business ?.
We will be forgotten in the dust just for the 3 months bug fixing because cant afford for a license for the " Enterprise " maintenance ? ,
It will be discounts of something like that for small and medium business ?.
It will be affordable the license fee for Spring framework maintenance ?.

This policy does affect users who think that open source is a way for them to get extended maintenance of high quality enterprise software for free , without them lifting a finger .
These are typically companies who can't or wo n't upgrade to the current version of Spring - - in contrast to the typical open source culture of following the latest and greatest release .
These folk will still get the latest versions of Spring -- and furthermore , typically are enterprises of a scale and risk profile that they are happy to pay for rock solid support .
From their point of view , the availability of 3 year support from SpringSource is a good thing , and a strong argument in favor of using Spring , rather than a problem .
Frankly , anyone who refuses to compile an open source project under any circumstances does n't really believe in open source : they believe in other people working for them for free .
while I agree with you on your point that companies who use the Spring framework in their productive environment should be able to pay for professional support , I still have a problem with abruptly changing terms in the middle of the game .
In many projects I have worked on , an evaluation of the technology to use was based on various aspects and licensing costs being one of these aspects .
In those cases were Spring was chosen to be base technology , I will now have to tell our customers that things have changed and that they will have to buy commercial support if they want to receive critical updates in a timely manner .
They will not be happy about that .
For upcoming projects , I do not have a problem with the new Spring maintenance scheme as I can inform the customer what to expect and then they can make their decision on that basis .
What I really dislike are the reactions of those customers who I recommended Spring to and who will now be unsatisfied with my advice .

There 's a lot of overreaction on this thread .
Rod , I do n't know if it 's overreaction , but it is certainly a strong reaction .
SpringSource 's announcement clarifies the relationship that the Company wishes to have with its Enterprise users and it does it in a reassuring way .
The statement does not say enough about what relationship the Company wants to have with its " Community " users : those who have enjoyed the product for free .
I have not made any contributions to the success of SpringSource ( other than one JIRA report ) - but I 've bought the books , I 've been to the Conferences , I 've banged my head against the wall to get the stuff to work and I 've married my career to it .
What kind of a relationship does SpringSource want to have with people like me in the future ?
As someone suggested , this would make an excellent subject for your next blog , as there are a number of voices in this thread who think that from now on the " Community " does n't matter any more in your business model .
I 'm inclined to disagree - I would say that if the " Community " disappears , so will the Spring Framework .

Even though Rod would really give the finger ( for example in a short youtube video ) to all of us who have voiced our worries and opinions , there would not be many short term negative impacts on spring framework - not in terms of innovations , adoption or revenue .
Well maybe in revenue if many of us would bite the bullet and buy subscriptions .
However longer term changes are more important as well as what the relationship with developers and spring framework on psychological level will be from now on .
Going from open source java development posterboy to Larry Ellison can happen over night , and though it can be labeled as over reaction - such is human psyche and any CEO and marketer should know that .
No matter what the message actually was or what the intention was , how it is interpreted matters .
As many of us have made commitments to spring framework in our skillsets , in our projects for our employers and in jobmarkets through the wide adoption of spring as de facto stack , there is really no way for spring framework disappear quickly even if they did something as silly as started to require developer subscriptions valued at $ 49 / developer / year or mandate that developers name their firstborns as Rod , no matter what the sex of the baby was .
But no questions asked about the value of spring framework .
It simply is a great framework - a whole stack - for application development and for a while me and many others were already asking whether we need not so good standards that come out of JCP when we have the benevolent de facto spring stack with constant streams of innovation .
Who would have thought that Spring source would answer that question so quickly .
So all and all this might be just a healthy announcement for all of us to take what spring gives with a grain of salt .
After all what Rod giveth , Rod can taketh away .

Blogging about this topic is a very good suggestion .
We care very much about the Spring community , and these changes are not intended to hurt it .
I would definitely class as " overreaction " much of the wild speculation on this thread , including references to license changes and many posters apparently not reading my or Mark 's comments .
Perhaps a blog would help to establish a more productive conversation .
We do always try to listen to feedback from the community -- which does n't include anti-Spring zealots who have lost the technical arguments over the years , are always clutching at straws to support their position and do n't care in the least for the Spring community .
Equally , the community should listen to our position , consider the enormous contribution we have made and will continue to make to open source and understand that enterprise customers being further incented to pay towards production usage is in everyone 's interests .

in response to Rod Johnson really thank you .
But these two assertions : [...]
Frankly , anyone who refuses to compile an open source project under any circumstances does n't really believe in open source : they believe in other people working for them for free .
and [...]
Anyone who really cares about open source should be willing to read and compile code , or pay for those who create open source to do it for them .
Folks who are n't willing to do this can complain , but I have little sympathy for them .
... are , imho , dramatically wrong , and , sincerely , I feel quite affected by them .
I can not say " insulted " , that would be too much , but frankly I do n't feel fine reading things like these .
I believe in open source .
Period .
I have founded myself three open source java projects in the last four years ( of which I abandoned the first one , and I am about to publish the third ) ; I have invested lots and lots and lots of my sleep and spare hours in creating open source code for free , while working for a non -os software company during the day .
So I always thought that I could say I belonged to the open source community in any of its definitions .
Yet , I never compiled the Spring Framework , and I will probably never do .
So I am confused ... maybe I do n't belong to the open source community as you define it , do I ?
Do you refer to the open source community or instead to the Spring contributors community ?.
Are they the same for you ?
If I do n't compile Spring ... do you really think that what I believe in is people working for me ?
I will read your code - as I have done many times - , but I will not compile it to create my own version in case you release a bug fix I need .
In that case , I will simply avoid using your bugged feature somehow , and go on .
Do n't you feel sympathy for me because of that ?
Well , I 'm sorry .
I never intended to make you feel unhappy about me .
In fact , I certainly feel sympathy for you , as you created and contributed some incredible , milestone software to the java industry .
Even if you are n't willing to compile my open source code .
And why wo n't I compile and create my own bugfixing release of Spring ?
Just because , and you certainly know this , releases are much more than a " . jar " file in a maven repo .
They are also a reference .
A version .
Versioning is a basic tool in software development management , which allows us to be able to know that we are using exactly the same version of this or that among our set of open source dependencies .
If we now have to compile ourselves Spring whenever a new bug is fixed ... how many unofficial versions of Spring will there appear ?
Thousands .
And not for adding specialized features here and there , as it would be normal with standard open source , no ...
Just for adding official bug fixes .
Oh , well ... bye bye , version control .
Welcome chaos .
You certainly know this .
And you certainly know , also , that creating packages for minor releases once you have the code in your repository is not real " effort " .
Come on , people 's effort creates the bug - fixing code , people 's effort creates documentation for each major release ... but it 's scripts that create the release packages most of the times .
Once you already have that code in your source repository , real effort has already been invested .
So I find your releases mean effort for us argument quite weak .
This said , I understand this is only a marketing move by SpringSource .
You make things a little more " tasty " for your corporate , spring - licensing customers ( most of which will probably not even understand the difference ) ... at the cost of making things more uncomfortable for the real people who made Spring be where it is : those who use it without ever remotely considering about compiling it .
The simple users .
Of which your named open source community , believe me , are only an incredibly tiny subset .
And many of those users , Rod , are now angry .
Not because this really affects them , as it probably does n't even if they think it does .
They are angry because you changed the rules of the game in the middle of it .
And that creates frustration and an important lack of confidence .
If you do this ... which will be your next steps ?
Maybe reducing that three months to one ?
Maybe discarding freely available releases and making everyone go to the source repository ?... not good , not safe enough .
Many of the people who made Spring so popular simply because they used it ( yeah , you know , they liked others working for them ) are now considering switching to other safer alternatives .
Or do you really believe that Spring is so popular because of your bunch of licensing customers or the hundreds ( maybe some thousands ) of patch contributors ?
ROFL .
You need much more people to get where you are .
You need enormous amounts of plain users .
But do n't get me wrong ... can you do this ?
Of course , it is YOUR product .
Will it make me stop using Spring ?
no way ( or at least not until you change the game again , which I am afraid you will ) .
Will you lose user base ...
I am sorry to say " Yes. A lot " .
How to change this and avoid the " SpringSource - has - propietarized - Spring " hype that is about to start and probably make your product lots of harm ?
imho , easy : Just apply that " three - month - only " condition to minor releases in old major releases .
This is , if you are in 4.0 , release freely all 4.0.x versions until you release 4.1 .
Once you have 4.1 released , release 4.0.x's freely just for a period ( or even do n't do it at all ) and make people pay for any further 4.0.x bugfixing releases .
At least this way you will offer a " way out " to your users : move forward , just switch to the new version .
If they do n't want to ... well ... anyone would think it is fair to pay for that .
No one will question your open - sourcedness in that scenario .
In brief , in my country we say " you should n't bite the hand that feeds you " , and I truly believe you have just done it .
But hey , I am not a marketing strategist ... they probably know better .
About marketing , I mean .
Or maybe I just did n't understand a thing about what is being discussed here ... which , of course , can be .
English is not my native language and well ...
In that case , I humbly apologise .
Regards , Daniel Fernández Jasypt project leader Rod , I have been , and still am , a very happy user ( and evangelist ) of Spring , for which Ithank you .

Just because , and you certainly know this , releases are much more than a " . jar " file in a maven repo .
They are also a .
A version .
Versioning is a basic tool in software development management , which allows us to be able to know that we are using exactly the same version of this or that among our set of open source dependencies ..
And not for adding specialized features here and there , as it would be normal with standard open source , no ...
Just for adding .
Oh , well ... bye bye , version control .
Welcome chaos .
You certainly know this .
And you certainly know , also , that creating packages for minor releases once you have the code in your repository is not real " effort " .
Come on , people 's effort creates the bug - fixing code , people 's effort creates documentation for each major release ... but it 's scripts that create the release packages most of the times .
Once you already have that code in your source repository , real effort has already been invested .
So I find yourargument quite weak .
This said , I understand this is only a marketing move by SpringSource .
You make things a little more " tasty " for your corporate , spring - licensing customers ( most of which will probably not even understand the difference ) ...
Of which your named , believe me , are only an incredibly tiny subset .
And many of those users , Rod , are now angry .
Not because this really affects them , as it probably does n't even if they think it does ..
And that creates frustration and an important lack of confidence .
If you do this ... not good , not safe enough .
Many of the people who made Spring so popular simply because theyit ( yeah , you know , they liked others working for them ) are now considering switching to otheralternatives .
Or do you really believe that Spring is so popular because of your bunch of licensing customers or the hundreds ( maybe some thousands ) of patch contributors ?
ROFL .
You need much more people to get where you are .
You need enormous amounts of .
But do n't get me wrong ... can you do this ?
Of course , it is YOUR product .
Will it make me stop using Spring ?
no way ( or at least not until you change the game again , which I am afraid you will ) .
Will you lose user base ...
I am sorry to say " Yes . A lot " .imho , easy : Just apply that " three - month - only " condition to minor releases inmajor releases .
This is , if you are in 4.0 , release freely all 4.0.x versions until you release 4.1 .
Once you have 4.1 released , release 4.0.x's freely just for a period ( or even do n't do it at all ) and make people pay for any further 4.0.x bugfixing releases .
At least this way you will offer a " way out " to your users : move forward , just switch to the new version .
If they do n't want to ... well ... anyone would think it is fair to pay for that .
No one will question your open - sourcedness in that scenario .
In brief , in my country we say , and I truly believe you have just done it .
But hey , I am not a marketing strategist ... they probably know better .
About marketing , I mean .
Or maybe I just did n't understand a thing about what is being discussed here ... which , of course , can be .
English is not my native language and well ...
In that case , I humbly apologise .

This is real evil , I would call to this company $ pringo , it only care to make a cash cow and not care their developers or community .
Why pay for a hype or subscription that actually their community are calling them the SS elite ? , this is hilarious .
Do n't suffer my friend developer , there is choices as in real life , we have lot of choices to choose from , Go on and move on and do n't stay in something that does n't have any value and even their workers wearing a tie are the disgrace of this move .

in response to Steve Mayhew I realise that enterprises based on Open Source models have to make their money somehow , but it always makes me a little sad when I see announcements like this .
The community helps build the product and then they get priced out of some of the benefits ?
It seems a shame that potentially useful fixes wo n't make it back to the community after that initial 3 months .

in response to Alessandro Santini I cannot believe Spring would go this route .
I 've been a firm Spring supporter in my company and with my clients .
It 's an excellent platform but this just makes me very sad .
Mark Brewer brought up an interesting point though .
If fixes are in the public source , what 's the difference between me building a new version ( or grabbing a nightly build ) versus what an Enterprise customer would get ?
Right now I monitor and watch all incoming commits to Spring , partly for my own edification , and also to see progress here : http://fisheye1.atlassian.com/viewrep/springframework /
Will the Enterprise customers still get the same code from this repo ?
I noticed Spring 3.0 is not being actively worked on in any public repository .
It seems the Spring 3.0 development has been very secretive and less transparent than any other version previously .
No JIRA issues for 3.0M1 have been resolved and no code committed on the public repo .
I just hope I can still be a champion for Spring both internally at my company and with clients after this change .

Nothing , and that is what the more competent ( mentally agile ? ) customers will start doing / continue to do .
Other companies had exactly the same experience .
The result : customers pressure the vendor into support contracts for the publicly available , non-enterprisey software .
And you know what ?
That 's actually smarter than most probably realize because it reduces lock - in and increases the value proposition of the entire ecosystem surrounding the project .
What SS needs to understand is that branches of the same product without really distinguihing features or without compelling added value are not only not sustainable from a maintenance point - of - view , they send a confusing message and eat resources for little or even negative return .
The main customers of infrastructure software are the developers and the computer .
Make them happy and the rest follows .

The focus of development is about to shift to 3.0 and there will be code to see soon .
Remember 2.0M1 , and the amount of code that only appeared in CVS just before the release ? -- because that 's when it got written .

Thank you for the clarifications both on the new support model and on the 3.0 development .
You and your team have always provided high quality releases and as someone who will always be leveraging the latest and greatest , if not milestone releases , I 'm happy to know things should n't change .
I 'm very excited about the 3.0 release which was one reason I asked the question about 3.0 and the repository .
I have n't heard much news about it lately and I know you guys are working hard on it so I was curious what the status was :) .
Are there plans to blog about some of the new exciting features ? :P

The hype is over and in a few weeks everybody will start pointing at how bad and bloated Spring was .
Such is the life of software engineers following trends .
The only ones who will complain are 1 ) The people who do n't like Spring anyway .
" Hype " is a term coined by people who think they are smarter than everyone else .
As if everyone else is n't intelligent enough to understand if they need something like Spring or not .
In other words , they wo n't be missed .
2 ) People who do n't seem to get the gist of the policy .
How many here just drop major releases the day they are released without testing them .
If you upgrade , test it .
If you find a problem , within 3 months , there 's a good possiblity that it will get fixed .
If that version does n't get fixed , wait until the next version .
How big of a difference will there be between say 2.5 and 2.6 ?
Probably not much .
This does n't seem like a big deal to me .

Then you wait for the next version .

Perhaps , I 'm different ( or lucky ) , but I only upgrade to releases , as opposed to nightly builds .
Also , I tend to let that new release bake just in case something comes up .
All they are doing is answering the question " What do I get for paid subscriptions ? "
Answer : Something better than what the free guys get .
More timely fixes .
You 'll get them sooner than the free guys ( who will get them in version 2.5.1 , instead of 2.5 and 93 days .
And that 's unreasonable ?

Yes it 's seems to be unreasonable , as You describe it .
Note that in most cases our code relies on external libraries using spring .
The best examples are CXF and struts2 .
Even if I get " better " release , CXF guys do n't .
I do n't develop my applications based exclusively upon Spring , I depend on 3rd party libraries whose depends on Spring also .
How is new policy is gonna work in this case - even if I 'm Enterprise Customer ?
I 've never , since Spring 2.0 found bug in Spring myself .
But CXF guys did , a few , and those bugs were fixed well after 3 months after major release .
This move , hurts me also .
Not only I pay for support , but this seems hurt my business in terms of free of choice ( CXF ) .
Not to mention that I expect that I will get , having paid SS , something more than I get now .
" Something more " means - I cannot imagine that I could get new release , with limited rights ( eg. I expect I 'll be able to freely redistribute it , as I can now ) or , even worse , without source code ...

Well , do n't use it then .
The problem seems very edge case and seems to be a huffing point more for people who had pre-existing bias against Spring than the emergence of a real problem .
Spring has released 5 or 6 versions since 2.0 with fairly regular frequency so even in the situation you describe , a fixed would have been made available fairly quickly .
If I 'm using 1.2.4 , how long is Spring supposed to provide bugfixes ?
For infinity ?
This is the one dark side of open source .
People think everything should be free always .
And then berate someone that at someone point , something has to foot the bill .
Look at the Linux guys when attacking AMD ( ATI ) or Nvidia .
And the worst thing they 've done is to say , " Unless you pay , you 'll get the bugfix a little later than sooner .
And even then , the fix is still FREE ! "
Who else does that ?!?!?
When was the last time you offered your customer free fixes ?
Or told you boss , " I 'll fix it this weekend .
Do n't pay me for it . "
Personally , I like eating .
Boo -hoo .
I 've seen far worse policies than what Spring is doing and they 've had years to really consider how to stick it to the community .
I suspect that you wo n't find many orgs up in arms about this change .
Spring , Hibernate , GWT , all this stuff is great and you did n't PAY for it .
Back in the day , 2000 , we paid more than $ 100 k for Weblogic 5.1 and tens of thousands for Oracle to get comparable features and service .
Wake me when a real problem arises .

What about licensing of maintenance releases ?
Go to top ]
Posted by : Mrinal Kanti
Posted on : September 19 2008 10:44 EDT
in response to Steve Mayhew Does that mean that the maintenance patches would be released under a proprietary license other than Apache 2 ?
If it is a proprietary license then it may impose restrictions for ISVs who distribute Spring as a part of their product .
Will there be a different licensing model for those ISVs ?
Say for example , I have a product released under Apache 2 and I distribute Spring as a part of my product .
Depending upon the SpringSource maintenance license I may not be able to provide free support ( under Apache 2 license ) for my product if changes to my product involve the fixes of Spring .
Can someone explain the implications in details ?

in response to Steve Mayhew Let 's say Spring 3.0 GA is out , and we get 3.0.x releases for three months .
After three months and a day let 's say Spring 3.0.5 is out - will it be unavailable for the community ?
Will we have to wait for Spring 3.1 or Spring 4 after that ?
Or does it simply mean that after no more than three months 3.1 will be out and we will get 3.1.x releases , but only commercial customers will get 3.0.x releases ?
If the former is true , than it 's turning the back to the community , meaning a non-paying customer may get stuck with a bugged release of Spring , even though a fixed release exists for paying customers .
If the latter is true then I do n't think it 's such a bad thing , as maintaining old releases consumes resources which would otherwise be used to advance Spring and add new features , and therefore it actually hurts the community .
If customers insist on staying with 3.0.1 instead of upgrading to 3.1 for example , they should pay the price for the extra work that SpringSource does to allow it .
I think a SpringSource representative should clear this up .

That 's what it sounds like to me .
Basically , they 're keeping two trees -- the internal tree , and the external , public tree .
For 3 months , they 'll keep the two in sync .
After that , they only have the internal tree which is distributed to their commercial clients .
In theory it would have to be distributed under a closed license to their clients , otherwise the clients may well release the changes ( though , more than likely not ) .
Basically , what they 're doing by this is saying that the community is n't doing anything for them any more .
Because it would be a bit mad for someone to contribute a change that they 're not going to get back , is n't it ?
So , all of the development ( and copyrights ) remain in house and they control distribution from here on out .

in response to Gabriel Axel Yes , the community will receive any set of fixes ( i.e. 3.0.1 , 3.0.2 , etc. ) that are made during the first three months after a major release .
From that point forward , until a new major release ( which means a change in the number on either side of the first decimial point - 3.1 or 4.0 would both apply ) , only SpringSource Enterprise customers will receive further maintenance releases .
However , the code for fixes will be in the public open source tree .
As Gabriel points out , Enterprise customers will have the added benefit of 3 years of support for any major version that they are running .

I would assume you are trying to reduce operating costs with this move and only committing to the additional effort when it is paid for by subscriptions .
What is the organizational effort in having both minor & major release streams for the community and customers ?
Is the effort so great that it consumes a significant amount of the company 's revenue which apparently has doubled this year .

The U.S. House of Representatives is considering a resolution ( HR 362 ) that calls on the Bush administration to take strong action against Iran , including a naval blockade of its ports .
A similar resolution is being considered by the Senate ( SR 580 ) .
The two resolutions are supposedly non-binding .
They also mention explicitly that they are not granting the Bush administration any authorization to stage military attacks on Iran .
Their language , however , is warlike .
In particular , a naval blockade of Iran ’s ports is certainly tantamount to a declaration of war .
One would expect that , on a matter as crucial as dealing with an important and influential Islamic nation such as Iran , especially after all the lies and exaggerations that were sold to the public in order to justify the invasion of Iraq , the resolutions that are being considered would speak the truth about Iran .
That is not the case , though .
Both resolutions are replete with factual errors , exaggerations , half - truths , and even outright lies .
Below , actual sentences from the two resolutions are in italics ; my analysis follows in normal text .
The Senate Resolution
" For nearly 20 years Iran had a covert nuclear program , until the program was revealed by an opposition group in Iran in 2002 . "
Outright lie : Iran did not have any covert nuclear program for nearly 20 years .
What it did have was a small nuclear research program that was safeguarded by the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) .
What Iran did not declare to the IAEA for many years was the construction of the Natanz facility for uranium enrichment , which was not illegal .
The subsidiary arrangements part of Iran ’s Safeguards Agreement with the IAEA stipulates that Iran was obligated to inform the agency of the existence of any nuclear facility only 180 days prior to introducing any nuclear materials into the facility .
In February 2003 Iran did just that , then introduced nuclear materials into that facility in summer of 2003 .
Interestingly , the resolution does not name the “ opposition group , ” because it would be embarrassing to mention that the group is the Mujahedin-e Khalq ( MEK ) , a group despised by the Iranian people and listed by the State Department as a terrorist organization .
The MEK has been in exile since 1981 .
It spied on Iran during its war with Iraq and helped Saddam Hussein ’s regime to ruthlessly suppress the uprisings by the Kurds and Shi’ites after the Persian Gulf War of 1990 - 91 .
" The International Atomic Energy Agency has confirmed that the government of Iran has engaged in such covert activities as the illicit importation of uranium hexafluoride , the construction of a uranium enrichment facility , experimentation with plutonium , the importation of centrifuge technology and the construction of centrifuges , and the importation of the design to convert highly enriched uranium gas into a metal and to shape it into the core of a nuclear weapon , as well as significant additional covert nuclear activities . "
Lies and exaggerations :
The uranium hexafluoride was imported from China , which , like Iran , is an NPT member state .
China was supposed to report the transaction , but it did not for many years .
The matter has now been completely clarified , and the material is safeguarded by the IAEA .
As explained above , construction of the uranium enrichment facility was not an illicit activity , because Iran had no legal obligation to declare it .
Indeed , the IAEA has never ever called the construction “ illicit ” or “ illegal . ”
Iran has never done any experiment with plutonium , except when the shah was in power .
What the Islamic Republic did do was experiment with polonium - 210 , not plutonium .
In its February 2008 report to the Board of Governors ( BoG ) of the IAEA , the agency declared its satisfaction with the resolution of the issue .
Manufacturing or importing centrifuges does not violate the Safeguards Agreement .
In fact , centrifuges are not even covered by the Safeguards Agreement , because they are also used for many non-nuclear purposes .
Only when the centrifuges are to be used for nuclear experimentation is Iran legally obligated to report to the IAEA the intention for the tests 90 days before carrying them out .
The IAEA has been fully informed by Iran , in due time , of all such activities .
As for the document for converting uranium fluoride to uranium metal , Iran had claimed that the A.Q.
Khan network gave the document to Iran , without Iran asking for it .
In its May 2008 report , the IAEA confirmed Iran ’s contention by reporting that the government of Pakistan had confirmed the existence of an identical document there .
From a practical point of view , since Iran has had for many years , with full knowledge of the IAEA , a uranium conversion facility in Isfahan , it does not make sense for it to pursue such a process .
The documents for designing a nuclear warhead are the subject of negotiations between Iran and the IAEA .
Iran claims that the documents are not authentic , and it has demanded to see their original copies , which the IAEA cannot provide .
There is considerable doubt about their authenticity .
Most importantly , in a February 2008 report to the IAEA , Mohamed ElBaradei , the director general , declared that , “ We have managed to clarify all the remaining outstanding issues , including the most important issue , which is the scope and nature of Iran ’s enrichment program . ”
" The government of Iran continues to expand the number of centrifuges at its enrichment facility and to enrich uranium in defiance of 3 binding United Nations Security Council resolutions demanding that Iran suspend its uranium enrichment activities . "
Incomplete story : Sending Iran ’s nuclear dossier to the UN Security Council had no legal basis , because the IAEA has never found Iran in violation of the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty ( NPT ) or in breaches of its Safeguards Agreement that could “ further a military purpose , ” the precise language of the agreement .
The reason for sending Iran ’s nuclear dossier to the UN Security Council was its rejection of the demand by the BoG of the IAEA to suspend its enrichment activity .
The IAEA and its BoG have , however , no legal authority to make such a demand .
Therefore , there was absolutely no legal basis for sending Iran ’s dossier to the UN Security Council .
The UN Security Council could not issue its resolutions against Iran under Chapter VII of the UN Charter , which is exclusively for the cases that pose a threat to the peace or international security , unless it first identifies , as the UN Charter demands , the threat .
However , the UN Security Council refused to identify the threat .
Instead , it merely referred to the resolution of the BoG of the IAEA which , as discussed above , had no legal basis .
In addition , Iran has stated repeatedly that , if the nuclear dossier is sent back to the IAEA , it will be willing to negotiate a temporary suspension of its enrichment program .
In fact , Iran did suspend , on a voluntary basis , its enrichment activities from October 2003 to February 2006 .
" The government of Iran has announced its intention to begin the installation of 6,000 advanced centrifuges , which , when operational , will dramatically reduce the time that it will take Iran to enrich uranium . "
Misrepresentation :
In compliance with its Safeguards obligations , Iran has declared to the IAEA its intentions for installing more centrifuges .
There is also nothing illegal about adding more centrifuges , so long as it is declared to the IAEA .
Moreover , the manufacturing and installation of the 6,000 advanced centrifuges will take years , not the short time that the resolution seems to imply .
" The 2007 National Intelligence Estimate reports that the government of Iran was secretly working on the design and manufacture of a nuclear warhead until at least 2003 and that Iran could have enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon as early as late 2009 . "
Exaggerations :
The NIE never presented any hard evidence that Iran was actually involved in the design of a nuclear warhead before 2003 .
Even if Iran was working on the problem before 2003 , it was only at the design stage , as Iran had no highly enriched uranium to manufacture a nuclear warhead .
In fact , it will not have highly enriched uranium any time soon , if ever .
As for manufacturing a bomb , there must first be an intention , but the IAEA has certified time and again that there is no evidence for such a goal .
At the same time , 2009 is a worst - case scenario pushed by Israel .
Most estimates , including the NIE ’s , are from 2010 - 2015 .
But , most importantly , Iran cannot use its present facility to produce highly enriched uranium , unless it leaves the NPT and expels the IAEA inspectors .
Iran has said repeatedly that it has no intention of leaving the NPT .
" Allowing the government of Iran to obtain a nuclear weapons capability would pose a grave threat to international peace and security . "
False :
As long as Iran ’s enrichment facilities are safeguarded by the IAEA , their potential for making a nuclear weapon is latent and under tight control .
In addition , Iran has indicated its willingness to sign the Additional Protocol , which will grant the IAEA much more intrusive power for inspection .
In fact , Iran voluntarily carried out the provisions of the Additional Protocol from October 2003 to August 2005 .
Finally , in 2005 Iran ’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei issued a fatwa forbidding production of nuclear weapons .
" If it were allowed to obtain a nuclear weapons capability , the government of Iran could share its nuclear technology , raising the frightening prospect that terrorist groups and rogue regimes might possess nuclear weapons capabilities . "
False : Iran has been accused of supporting Hezbollah and Hamas , but it has never been accused of sharing conventional weapons technology with them .
So why would Iran share nuclear technology with any group or nation ?
In addition , any nuclear material manufactured in any nation has a “ genetic ” signature .
If it is used anywhere , experts can identify its origin .
Iranian leaders are fully aware that if they provide nuclear materials to any terrorist group , their origin can be identified , leading to massive retaliation by the international community .
" Allowing the government of Iran to obtain a nuclear weapons capability would severely undermine the global nuclear non-proliferation regime that , for more than 4 decades , has contained the spread of nuclear weapons . "
False :
The non-proliferation regime has already been greatly weakened not by Iran , but by three U.S. allies and friends : Israel , Pakistan , and India , none of which is an NPT member state .
Even if there were a military dimension to Iran ’s nuclear program , it would be due to the nuclear arsenals of Israel and Pakistan and the presence of the U.S. forces in the Middle East .
In addition , if the U.S. transfers its nuclear technology to India , it would be violating its own NPT and non-proliferation obligations .
" It is likely that one or more Arab states would respond to Iran obtaining a nuclear weapons capability by following Iran ’s example , and several Arab states have already announced their intentions to pursue ‘ peaceful nuclear ’ programs . "
Half - truth : Three Arab states that may seek peaceful nuclear programs are U.S. allies .
One is Egypt , with which the U.S. has close military , intelligence , and economic relations , providing it with nearly $ 2 billion in annual aid , which is critical to Egypt ’s solvency .
Why does n’t the U.S. discourage Egypt ’s intentions ?
The second nation is Saudi Arabia , the known oil reserves of which are twice as large as Iran ’s , with a population 1/3 of Iran’s .
Why ca n’t the U.S. use the same logic with the Saudis that it has tried to use with Iran by telling them , " You have too much oil and , therefore , no need for nuclear technology for the foreseeable future . "
In addition , if this really concerns the U.S. , why has it not protested the Saudi agreement with France for obtaining nuclear technology ?
The third nation is the small island of Bahrain , where the U.S. 5th Fleet is headquartered .
Bahrain has no conceivable need for nuclear reactors .
If the U.S. is worried about the spread of nuclear technology , why has it agreed to sell the technology to Bahrain ?
In addition , if the Arab nations did not try to acquire nuclear weapons after Israel developed them in the 1960s , why would they want to do so in reaction to the peaceful nuclear program of Iran , a Muslim nation ?
" Allowing the government of Iran to obtain a nuclear weapons capability would directly threaten Europe and ultimately the United States because Iran already has missiles than can reach parts of Europe and is seeking to develop intercontinental ballistic missiles . "
Outright lies : Iran has no program for intercontinental missiles .
In fact , the Arms Control Association stated in October 2007 that Iran could not develop an intercontinental missile by 2015 , even if it wanted to .
Iran ’s present missiles cannot reach any part of Europe except Turkey , its neighbor .
Iran ’s missiles are purely defensive , because such missiles are offensive weapons only if the nation that owns them has the ability to project power far beyond its borders .
Iran does not have such ability , nor is there any evidence that it aspires to have it .
In addition , Europe is Iran ’s most significant commercial partner .
Why would Iran attack its commercial partners ?
" The government of Iran has repeatedly called for the elimination of our ally , Israel . "
False : Aside from some inconsequential and often deliberately mistranslated rhetoric , Iran has never had any plan to attack Israel .
It actually purchased weapons from Israel during its war with Iraq , and Iranian oil is reaching Israel indirectly .
Iranian leaders are also fully aware that any attack on Israel will bring a massive counterattack by both Israel and the U.S.
In fact , many Iranian leaders have stated repeatedly that it is up to the Israelis and Palestinians to resolve their own conflict .
" The government of Iran has advocated that the United States withdraw its presence from the Middle East . "
Misrepresentation : Iran is not the only nation that has called on the U.S. to withdraw its forces from the Middle East .
Many nations consider the presence of the U.S. forces to be the greatest source of instability in the Middle East .
Moreover , why is Iran ’s advocacy an “ offense ” ?
" The United States , the Russian Federation , the People ’s Republic of China , France , the United Kingdom , and Germany have offered to negotiate a significant package of economic , diplomatic , and security incentives if Iran complies with the Security Council ’s demand to suspend uranium enrichment .
" The government of Iran has consistently refused such offers . "
Half - truth : Iran has stated repeatedly that it is willing to negotiate its entire nuclear program without any preconditions and that a suspension of its uranium enrichment program should be an outcome of the negotiations , rather than a precondition .
Iran did freeze its enrichment activities from October 2003 to February 2006 , but because Europe did not reward Iran for the suspension , as it had promised to , Iran stopped the suspension .
Iranian Foreign Minister Manouchehr Mottaki just announced that Iran will soon start negotiating with the 5+1 group .
The House Resolution
Many paragraphs in the House Resolution are similar to those in the Senate version and therefore require no further response .
I analyze only those statements that seem to add fuel to the fire of the threat of an attack on Iran .
" Iran has used its banking system , including the Central Bank of Iran , to support its proliferation efforts and its assistance to terrorist groups , leading the Department of Treasury to designate four large Iranian banks proliferators and supporters of terrorism . "
Exaggeration : The Treasury Department has never presented any evidence that Iran uses its banking system for proliferation purposes .
In addition , the use of Iran ’s banking system to fund Hamas and Hezbollah has been greatly exaggerated at the very least .
See , in particular , the article in the Israeli newspaper Ha’aretz on June 26 , 2008 , “ Are Sanctioned Iranian Banks Actually Sponsoring Anti-Western Terror ? ” which questioned the Treasury Department ’s claims about Bank Melli of Iran .
" Iran ’s support for Hezbollah has enabled that group to wage war against the government and people of Lebanon , leading to its political domination of that country . "
Outright lies : Hezbollah and its allies among the Christian Maronites ( the March 8 Coalition ) have a large number of representatives in the Lebanese parliament .
With the mediation of our ally Qatar , Hezbollah and the Lebanese government recently resolved all of their differences .
Hezbollah enjoys strong support among a very significant portion of the population .
It is , therefore , not clear who are the “ government and people of Lebanon ” that the resolution is referring to .
" Iran ’s support for Hamas has enabled it to illegally seize control of Gaza from the Palestinian Authority , and to continuously bombard Israeli civilians with rockets and mortars . "
Outright lies :
First of all , Hamas won elections that were certified as democratic by former President Jimmy Carter .
It took control of Gaza , only because the people of Gaza supported it .
According to Fatah , the main group in the Palestinian Authority , many wealthy Saudis provide far more financial aid to Hamas than Iran ever has , but the U.S. is silent about this for the obvious reasons .
" Iran continues to provide training , weapons , and financial assistance to Shia militants inside of Iraq and antigovernment warlords in Afghanistan .
" Those Shia militant groups and Afghan warlords use Iranian training , weapons , and financing to attack American and allied forces trying to support the legitimate governments of Iraq and Afghanistan . "
Outright lies :
The U.S. has never presented any concrete evidence that Iran provides weapons to any group in Iraq or Afghanistan .
The Shi’ite groups that represent the legitimate government of Iraq are the same groups that spent years in Iran in exile .
Iran was instrumental recently in preventing Moqtada al - Sadr ’s militia from starting a full rebellion against the government of Iraq .
As for Afghanistan , Iran was instrumental in helping the U.S. to overthrow the Taliban .
Iran ’s ally , the Northern Alliance , which Iran had supported for years , was the first group to reach Kabul and overthrow the Taliban .
According to the U.S. representative James Dobbins at the conference on the Future of Afghanistan in December 2001 , Iran was instrumental in helping the National Unity Government of President Hamid Karzai to form .
After the U.S. , no nation has invested more in rebuilding Afghanistan than Iran .
Above all , both the Taliban and al - Qaeda are archenemies of Iran .
" Iran is further destabilizing the Middle East by underwriting a massive rearmament by Syria . "
Outright lie :
With mediation by our ally Turkey , Syria and Israel have been secretly negotiating a peace agreement .
Syria ’s only other enemy , the regime of Saddam Hussein , is gone .
Therefore , what is this imaginary rearmament for ?
Where is the evidence for it ?
Where is the evidence that Iran is paying for it , even if it exists ?
On the other hand , the U.S. has agreed to a massive rearmament of some Arab states and Israel by agreeing to sell them up to $ 50 billion in modern weapons , hence contributing greatly to the region ’s arms race and instability .
" Through efforts , Iran seeks to establish regional hegemony , threatens long - standing friends of the United States in the Middle East , and endangers American national security interests . "
Exaggeration : Regional hegemony will not be achieved with an Iranian army that has been designed solely to defend Iran , and an air force that belongs in museums .
It is therefore clear that practically every paragraph in the Senate and House resolutions contains factual errors , lies , exaggerations , or half - truths .
Iran can be criticized on many fronts , especially for its political and social repression and violating the basic human and civil rights of the Iranian people .
But Iran is not a threat to the United States or Israel .
It is not anywhere close to having nuclear weapons , even if it wants to .
Therefore , the American public must recognize these resolutions for what they really are : war plans advocated by the War Party and its allies in the pro-Israel lobbies .

LONDON , England ( CNN ) -- Climate change is happening faster than previously predicted according to a new World Wildlife Fund report .
The WWF say climate change threat has worsened in the 15 months since the IPCC last reported .
Bringing together some of the most recent scientific reports and data , " Climate change : faster , stronger , sooner " reveals that global warming is accelerating more rapidly than the predictions made in the IPCC 's Fourth Assessment Report published in 2007 .
One of the most concerning aspects of recent data is evidence that , in some places , the Arctic Ocean is losing sea ice 30 years ahead of current IPCC predictions .
Summer sea ice is now forecasted to completely disappear in the summer months sometime between 2013 and 2040 -- something which has n't happened for over a million years .
The report 's author , geoscientist Dr Tina Tin told CNN : " Arctic sea ice is melting much faster than everybody had been expecting .
Why ?
Well , maybe it's because the positive feedback mechanisms have kicked in much quicker than we have been able to quantify . "
Positive feedback mechanisms amplify changes occurring in the climate .
In the case of the Arctic region there is a sort of vicious circle of warming occurring .
White ice sheets perform an important function in moderating global temperature by reflecting heat from the sun back into space .
But they have begun to melt as the earth has warmed .
The result is more dark sea water which absorbs heat , which in turn warms the earth more and encourages further melting .
Globally , sea levels are now expected to rise more than double the IPCC 's most recent forecast of 0.59 meters before the end of the century .
This will put millions of people in coastal regions at risk .
World food production is also feeling the heat as yields of wheat , maize and barley had dwindled in recent months .
In Europe , ecosystems in the North and Baltic Sea are believed to be experiencing their warmest temperatures since records began .
And the Mediterranean is likely to experience an increased frequency of droughts .
The WWF report also highlights a 2007 study conducted by the British Antarctic Survey .
" Widespread acceleration of tidewater glaciers on the Antarctic Peninsula " concluded that floating tide - water glaciers on the peninsula are losing ice faster and making a greater contribution to global sea level rise than was previously thought .
Earlier this month , the WWF highlighted the impact that global warming is likely to have on Antarctic penguin colonies .
According to Dr Tin , more Antarctic data is due to be published next year when the Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research publish their findings .
Scheduled for release in spring 2009 the " Antarctic Climate Change and the Environment " is expected to reveal more evidence of damaging climate effects on the continent .
While Dr Tin says that it is true that parts of the Antarctic are not warming or perhaps even cooling , the Western Antarctic Peninsula has experienced some of the most rapid increases in warming .
" Over the past 50 years , it has warmed more than four times faster than the average rate of Earth 's overall warming , " Dr Tin said .
But Dr
Tin remains unsure whether this most recent climate data represents the beginning of a tipping point .
" We think there are possibly tipping points ahead and some scientists , in terms of the Arctic sea ice , think we have probably gone past the tipping point .
But it 's very difficult to get a strong handle on , " she said .
Nevertheless , she describes her report as a " sobering overview " which " comes at a critical time during the political negotiations of the European Union 's climate and energy package " .
Newly elected Vice Chair of the IPCC and climate scientist , Jean - Pascal van Ypersele endorsed the WWF publication .
" It is clear that climate change is already having a greater impact than most scientists had anticipated , so it 's vital that international mitigation and adaptation responses become swifter and more ambitious , " van Ypersele said .

« UFC 90 card line - up | Home | Your ‘ horrible media timing ’ winner of this year ( involving the Orlando Sentinel and Seth Petruzelli ) »
By Zach Arnold | October 20 , 2008
The company is reportedly out of the MMA business .
Update : ESPN , on their channel newsticker , announced the news of Elite XC shutting down .
The crawler also says that EXC promoters are ‘ still under investigation ’ by the Florida Boxing Commission .
Reports : Sherdog | MMA Mania | Bloody Elbow | Sports Illustrated
Remember , Jeremy Lappen was only saying days ago how ‘ excited ’ he was for Elite XC ’s future .
If you believe Dave Meltzer ’s report , then the Elite XC ‘ stand - up scandal ’ involving Seth Petruzelli and Kimbo Slice supposedly stopped CBS in its tracks from purchasing Elite XC .
To review the history of the ‘ stand - up scandal , ’ just click here and read all the stories .
Meltzer was adamant in a radio interview that both CBS and Showtime were thrilled with the third Elite XC show , but once the Petruzelli scandal hit , the corporation did n’t want to be involved in the stand - up scandal and all of the ‘ fixed fight ’ media coverage .
As for CBS ’s future in MMA , Meltzer claims CBS will do one of two things :
1 ) Wash their hands of MMA
2 ) Go with Affliction
He claims that Affliction ’s payroll is so high that they would need PPV and need 175,000 - 200,000 buys to break even with CBS , but CBS is n’t going to pay that kind of money for a show with Fedor headlining .
Adam Swift adds more credence to Meltzer ’s report with this follow - up :
Multiple sources told MMAPayout.com in the week leading up to the 10/4 event that the deal was all but complete with the paper work already drafted .
There were even preliminary conversations regarding the return of Gary Shaw to the equation .
The deal ultimately collapsed under the weight of Standgate and possibly CBS ’s financial condition .
Gary Shaw , the same person who told the LA Times that he did n’t find anything ethically wrong in encouraging fighters to stand - up during fights .
Company assets
In regards to questions about who gets the first rights to purchase or obtain Elite XC ’s assets , the answer is …
Showtime Networks Inc..
Quick reaction
This does n’t surprise me , although I am happy to hear that CBS was not interested in bailing out Elite XC .
Much in the same line that Fuji TV pulled the plug on PRIDE , CBS pulled the plug on Elite XC .
As I asked in a previous post on this site , why would Viacom or any CBS shareholders go to bat for a scandal - tainted company ?
There was no value in them doing so , given how much PR damage they could suffer from it .
It goes back to the question I asked in regards to how CBS would react to pressure from shareholders or from outside interests once the stand - up scandal grew legs — and the response became very clear , as we can now see .
You can have shady people involved in an MMA promotion , but if that promotion ca n’t do business in a self - contained manner and has to rely on a corporate sugar - daddy that wants control , then that MMA promotion has no margin for error at all .
On a personal note , I find intriguing that ( once again ) several MMA web sites got caught with their pants down when it came to trying to avoid covering a scandal in the fight business .
We know a ton of MMA web sites that refused to cover the PRIDE yakuza scandal , which led to the demise of that organization , and a few big MMA web sites that ignored the stand - up scandal only to watch Elite XC close its doors .

GOP Rep. John B. Shadegg is among many Republicans fighting for their political lives .
GOP ditches recruits to save incumbents
Darren White and Erik Paulsen were prized Republican recruits , House candidates poised to be the new face of the GOP on Capitol Hill .
But as the two head into the homestretch of their campaigns , GOP operatives say they ’ll probably have to win — or lose — on their own .
The money national Republicans earmarked for White in New Mexico and for Paulsen in Minnesota will likely go instead to protect GOP incumbents who once looked like locks for reelection .

GOP Reps .
John B. Shadegg of Arizona , Lee Terry of Nebraska , Henry Brown Jr. of South Carolina and Dan Lungren of California are all fighting for their political lives , a reversal of fortunes that has caught even the most astute campaign observers by surprise .
It ’s an omen and an echo .
Just a few weeks before voters went to the polls in 2006 , veteran Republicans Gil Gutknecht in Minnesota , Jim Leach in Iowa and Jim Ryun in Kansas suddenly found themselves in tough reelection fights .
By the time the party saw what was happening , it was already too late .
Unknown challengers booted the lawmakers from office in a landslide election that gave Democrats control of both the House and the Senate .
If 2008 looks like 2006 , a new wave of veteran Republicans will be out on the streets , and the colleagues they leave behind could find themselves with the smallest minority since the post - Watergate era .
“ If you ’re a Republican in a less - than - outstanding district , you want to have taken a poll in the last two weeks no matter who you ’re running against , ” said David Wasserman , an analyst on House races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report .
“ The DCCC has made advertising decisions that have forced Republicans ’ hands , ” he continued , mentioning Terry ’s seat in Nebraska and one held by conservative Rep. Mark Souder in Indiana .
“ Republicans , in turn , need to spend in these districts .
And $ 500,000 to the [ National Republican Congressional Committee ] is a whole lot more meaningful than $ 500,000 to the [ Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee ] . ”
Despite some early suggestions that John McCain would help a few Republicans in marginal districts , the presidential election is playing to the Democrats ’ favor in races across the country .
Barack Obama ’s current momentum is strong enough that even some Republicans in red states , such as Nebraska , have tied themselves to the Democrats this fall .
In Nebraska , where Obama hired a state director to help him turn out the vote in and around Omaha , Terry just sent voters a piece of mail with a testimonial from a woman who plans to split her vote between the Republican congressman and the Democratic presidential contender — a sure sign that the GOP brand is lagging along with the economy and McCain ’s own prospects for the White House .
“ Even if you ’re an incumbent Republican member of Congress , you still need to run against Congress , ” said GOP pollster Rob Autry of Public Opinion Strategies .
“ This is not an environment where the warm - and - fuzzy positives work .
People are upset , they want to know you get it , they want to know you ’re frustrated like them . ”
In a Washington Post / ABC News poll released Monday , 90 percent of Americans said the country is headed in the wrong direction .
Only 8 percent said the country is on the right track .
In California , Republican operatives have noticed some troubling trends .
Two years ago , Lungren — who is completing his seventh term in Congress — beat physician and Vietnam War veteran Bill Durston by 21 points .
But the economy has taken its toll , and Lungren ’s district has one of the highest foreclosure rates in the country .
In a newly released Democratic poll , Lungren leads Durston by just 3 percentage points .
Former GOP consultant Allan Hoffenblum said Rep. Dana Rohrabacher and other California Republicans , including Reps. David Dreier and Brian Bilbray , are also at risk .
“ The Republican base is not sufficient by itself to elect a Republican in those [ California ] districts ; they still need the independent vote , ” Hoffenblum said .
“ In the past decade , they have been reliably voting Republican for president and for Congress . …
There are a lot of angry and scared voters out there .
This is not your traditional environment . ”
In South Carolina , Brown is facing Democrat Linda Ketner , the free - spending heiress to the Food Lion fortune .
So far , Ketner has outspent Brown , and even Republican operatives acknowledge the race is competitive in the coastal district in which President Bush garnered 61 percent of the vote in 2004 .
“ With her buying a lot of TV ads , it raises the specter that she can run a competitive race , ” said Jay Ragley , executive director of the state ’s Republican Party .
Bob Lord , a 51 - year - old tax attorney who is challenging Shadegg in Arizona , is something of an accidental candidate .
Lord tried to recruit area Democrats to challenge Shadegg in 2006 .
When he could n’t get anyone to do it , he decided to take on Shadegg himself .
Polling now shows the race in a dead heat , despite the suburban Phoenix district ’s traditional Republican advantage .
Down the stretch , national Republicans would like to see their troubled incumbents do what most vulnerable lawmakers do in a tight spot :
Go negative .
But to do that , they need to have money and they need to start soon , so they have enough time to define relatively unknown opponents before those opponents make the attacks irrelevant .
Congressional Republicans have struggled to regroup from their crushing loss in 2006 , as fundraising lagged and a record - tying number of GOP lawmakers decided to call the 110th Congress their last .
Those signs of decline led political prognosticators on both sides of the aisle to believe House Republicans would suffer a net loss on Election Day , somewhere in the neighborhood of 12 to 18 seats .
Those projections now hover somewhere between 20 and 35 seats .
Republicans got a break in Florida on Monday after ABC News reported that freshman Democratic Rep. Tim Mahoney had paid off a former staffer to cover up their affair .
The party may also see gains if Monday ’s dramatic market surge becomes more than a one - day story .
Otherwise , the landscape remains pretty bleak .
Democrats have maintained a sizable fundraising advantage since taking control of the House .
At the end of August , House Democrats had nearly $ 54 million in cash , according to the Federal Election Commission .
By contrast , Republicans had only $ 14.3 million to spend down the stretch .
As of Sunday , the DCCC had spent money in 47 congressional districts .
Of those , 34 are seats held by Republicans .
In contrast , the NRCC has spent money in 13 districts — 10 of which it is trying to defend .
As of this past weekend , Democrats have spent nearly $ 24.7 million , while Republicans have spent less than $ 2 million .
“ We ’ve paid a price for that , ” retiring Virginia Rep .
Tom Davis , a past NRCC chairman , told a group of reporters at the National Press Club on Friday .
“ In some of those districts , the mold has hardened . ”
The DCCC recently reserved $ 435,000 in Terry ’s Nebraska district , and operatives expect the NRCC will soon feel the need to respond in kind .
Republicans , however , have decided to cut back on advertising in races such as Paulsen ’s and White ’s , where the party once thought it could pick up seats .
Party operatives are now waiting to see if the conservative group Freedom ’s Watch will continue to spend money in districts where the NRCC itself is scaling back its own ad buys .
The group is spending money to support Republican Rep. Jon C. Porter in Nevada , even though the NRCC pulled its money there , and has reserved time in Alabama and North Carolina as the GOP ’s official campaign arm redirects its funding elsewhere .
As of Sunday , the group had spent nearly $ 2.4 million this cycle on House races , but the newly founded progressive group Patriot Majority , along with its regional offshoots , has spent almost $ 3.7 million in support of Democrats .

Politics
ALLENTOWN , Pa.  Though Senator John McCain has promised to not raise taxes , his campaign acknowledged Wednesday that the health plan he outlined this week would have the effect of increasing tax payments for some workers , primarily those with high incomes and expensive health plans .
The campaign cannot yet project how many taxpayers might see their taxes go up , said Douglas Holtz - Eakin , Mr. McCain ’s top domestic policy adviser .
But Mr. Holtz - Eakin said in an interview that for some , Mr. McCain ’s health care tax credits would not be large enough to compensate for his proposal to eliminate the tax breaks afforded to workers with employer - provided health benefits .
On stops in Florida and Pennsylvania this week , Mr. McCain , the presumptive Republican presidential nominee , has emphasized a free - market approach that he said would lower health care costs and make insurance affordable .
To do so he is proposing a major tax change that he hopes will make the insurance marketplace more competitive and less expensive in part by encouraging more people to buy health insurance on their own instead of receiving it from their employers .
NEW YORK ( Fortune ) -- Leverage , the menace that helped bring down some of the biggest names on Wall Street , is now threatening the health of big banks across the Atlantic .
The credit crunch that led to the failure or forced sale of seven big U.S. financial firms last month is now wreaking its havoc on Europe .
Four major financial institutions have been rescued in just the past week , and financial shares are in free fall as investors fret that more banks will need help .
The problems in Europe are worth watching because additional bank failures threaten to further undermine investor confidence at a time when the global economy is slowing , stocks are plummeting , and short - term credit markets are locked up .
Economists fear that with the global financial system under severe stress , the economy is especially vulnerable to a shock that could deepen what 's shaping up as a serious recession .
" The events of the past month have clearly increased the risk that the adjustment to the Anglo - Saxon household balance sheet is sharp and painful rather than prolonged and manageable , " wrote Merrill Lynch economist Alex Patelis .
" In a scenario of a violent U.S. consumption downturn , no economy globally would be spared , and a global recession ... would be unavoidable . "
The problems in Europe show that the ills that brought down the likes of Lehman Brothers - heavy borrowing to support lending on now depreciating real estate assets - are now being felt in the rest of the world .
Even the institutions that avoided the worst excesses of the subprime mortgage mess - such as Barclays ( BCS ) , which recently took over some Lehman operations in the United States , and Deutsche Bank ( DB ) - have asset - to - equity ratios well in excess of the ones carried by commercial banks in the United States .
That means firms from ING ( ING ) of the Netherlands to UBS ( UBS ) in Switzerland have that much less of an equity cushion to absorb any losses on loans that go sour as the recession takes root .
The fear that shareholders in those banks may be wiped out or seriously diluted in the next wave of rescues sent shares of big banks plunging Monday , with ING dropping 14 % , UBS sliding 9 % , and Deutsche Bank dropping 6 % .
" Some of the major European banks have leverage ratios ( often over 30 , in some cases close to 50 ) that must , under current market conditions , be considered a disaster in waiting , " Daniel Gros and Stefano Micossi of the Centre for European Policy Studies wrote last month .
Wall Street parallels
Indeed , the big European banks ' leverage ratios - reflecting the amount of debt they carry for each dollar of equity held by their shareowners - rival those of the big U.S. investment banks .
The U.S. investment banks ran aground because they borrowed heavily in short - term debt markets to buy assets that the market lost appetite for as real estate prices stopped rising .
When the collapse of the subprime mortgage market in the U.S. caused bond investors to stop offering those cheap , short - term loans , the investment banks were forced to sell assets to bring in new capital and to seek more stable funding via the deposits attracted by commercial banks .
When 2008 started , there were five independent Wall Street firms : Goldman Sachs ( GS , Fortune 500 ) , Morgan Stanley ( MS , Fortune 500 ) , Merrill Lynch ( MER , Fortune 500 ) , Lehman Brothers , and Bear Stearns .
Now , with the failure of Bear and Lehman , Merrill 's agreement to sell itself to Bank of America ( BAC , Fortune 500 ) , and the decision by Goldman and Morgan to become commercial banks , there are none .
The European banks have big deposit bases , so the funding pressures they face wo n't be as acute as the ones that swept down Wall Street last month .
Still , it 's worth noting that the wave of selling that has slammed stock and bond markets since the demise of Lehman has spurred governments in the United States and Europe to take unusual measures to stem the flow of capital .
Authorities , fearing bank runs like the ones that brought down California 's IndyMac and Seattle 's Washington Mutual , have raised deposit insurance limits .
Germany and Ireland have guaranteed the safety of bank deposits , and the bailout signed last week by President Bush boosts the FDIC limit to $ 250,000 from $ 100,000 .
But it 's not yet clear whether the deposit limits will do much to keep depositors from fleeing banks - or whether the result will be to strengthen weaker banks at the expense of the stronger ones .
The heavy use of leverage is n't the only link between Europe and Wall Street .
Many European banks used deals with American firms such as insurer AIG - itself the recipient of an $ 85 billion emergency loan from the Fed last month - to reduce their regulatory capital requirements , Gros and Micossi note .
AIG said in its second - quarter report with regulators that $ 307 billion worth of its $ 441 billion credit default swap portfolio was written for the purpose of providing regulatory capital relief to European banks .
By agreeing to guarantee loans on the banks ' books , AIG allowed the banks to carry less capital against the loans - freeing the banks to lend that money elsewhere .
AIG was a leading player in this business , but by no means was it the only one .
" The primary benefit of the credit default swap is its power as a new source of risk distribution , " according to a note on the J.P. Morgan Treasury Services Web site .
" It frees up regulatory capital , which facilitates additional business . "
Now that the banks can see the value of their assets tumbling and capital is getting harder to raise , it 's clear that the additional business was facilitated at substantial cost .

Ni'lin is scene of frequent violent clashes between troops and protesters
Three weeks ago , Israeli soldiers burst into Awwad Sror 's small family home in the Palestinian West Bank town of Nilin .
Mr Sror 's family say that when he intervened as troops arrested his younger brother , Aqal , he was shot from close range with at least three rubber - coated steel bullets .
One hit him in the chest , another smashed his jaw , while a third entered his right eye socket and fractured his skull .
Mr Sror , a married father of three , is lucky to be alive .
But he has lost the sight in his right eye .
Israel has investigated the incident and has concluded that the soldier who fired the shots acted properly when Mr Sror tried to stop his brother being taken away .
The family argues it was an excessive use of force .
' Foul '
In and around Nilin there are regular , sometimes violent , protests against the continued building of Israel 's West Bank barrier which snakes around a new Jewish settlement on the other side of the small valley .
Our correspondent says Skunk is the worst thing he has ever smelled Acutely aware of accusations that it is using disproportionate force in political hot - spots like Nilin , Israel is deploying a new , non-lethal but highly effective and highly - offensive weapon .
It 's called Skunk .
Imagine the worst , most foul thing you have ever smelled .
An overpowering mix of rotting meat , old socks that have n't been washed for weeks - topped off with the pungent waft of an open sewer .
Imagine being covered in the stuff as it is liberally sprayed from a water cannon .
Then imagine not being able to get rid of the stench for at least three days , no matter how often you try to scrub yourself clean .
The beauty of Skunk - if beauty is the right word - is that it is said to be completely organic .
' Secret ' ingredients
No illegal chemicals , no proscribed substances - just a thoroughly disgusting mix of yeast , baking powder and a few other " secret " ingredients .
It 's totally harmless , you can even drink it
Superintendent David Ben Harosh
The Israeli police force has high hopes of turning Skunk into a commercial venture and selling it to law - enforcement agencies overseas .
Superintendent David Ben Harosh treats
Skunk as something of a pet project .
The way he hugged the litre bottle of dirty , green liquid close to his chest as we talked was odd - most people would surely keep it at arm 's length .
" It 's totally harmless , you can even drink it , " boasted Superintendent Harosh - as though encouraging me to swallow a mouthful .
Reporters will sometimes go the " extra mile " to add authenticity to their story , but not this time .
No way .
For human rights groups , the jury is still out on Skunk .
They object to the arbitrary way in which innocent bystanders can be soaked with the stuff - having to suffer for days afterwards .
Then again , protestors and villagers are still being killed and seriously injured in the West Bank by more conventional weapons .
As unpleasant and as disgusting as it is , being sprayed with Skunk may ultimately be preferable to being hit by a rubber - coated bullet or choking and vomiting under the effects of tear - gas or pepper - spray .

What are these ?
This past weekend , I let my vagina cook dinner .
It cleaned my apartment and even took the dog for a walk .
On Sunday , it was a little tired , so my vagina just relaxed on the couch , read a good book and watched a few movies on TV .
Later this week , I ’ll probably have it pay my bills , do some laundry and maybe even catch up on some emails to friends .
I figured , hey , if John McCain ’s right and my vagina can vote , what else could this amazing orifice do for me ?
The selection of Alaska ’s Gov. Sarah Palin as McCain ’s running mate is blatant tokenism , that much is obvious .
To offer up Palin as consolation for Hillary Clinton completely belittles women ’s intelligence .
Those who supported Clinton ’s historic campaign did so not simply because she was a woman , but because she was smart and experienced — she ’s a former First Lady and second term senator .
Palin was the mayor of a town that ’s smaller than my neighborhood and has spent less than two years as the governor of Alaska , which itself has a population smaller than Austin’s .
Additionally , Clinton supported the interests of women voters .
Palin is an anti-choice , anti-environmentalist who believes creationism should be taught in science classrooms and promotes consumer - driven health insurance .
So what if she ’s a self - proclaimed hockey mom ?
She fundamentally opposes everything Clinton supported and most Americans do n’t give a crap about hockey anyway .
Alas , choosing Palin was still a clever move on McCain ’s part .
We ’ve all heard of the disaffected Clinton supporters who so desperately wanted to see a woman president in their lifetimes that they are now threatening to vote for McCain as retribution for the Democratic party ’s treatment of Clinton .
Personally , I think their numbers are inflated by the news media and those who are serious about voting for McCain would have done so if Clinton had never been in the running to begin with .
All the same , he ’s likely to secure the few illogical women whose only investment in the election is seeing a woman take the highest office —
McCain ’s 72 years old , which puts Palin one rough influenza season away from the presidency — plus , he ’s guaranteed the support of the evangelical right who are salivating over the demonstrably anti-choice candidate .
The selection puts most women in rather tenuous position , though .
Increased numbers of women in politics , any women for either party , is a positive move toward greater equality in our government .
But it is nearly impossible to feel any inkling of support for a woman whose views are so incredibly divergent from my own .
Her personal politics do nothing to strengthen and support women ’s interests and her lack of experience makes motherhood her most strongly noted accomplishment .
She has five children , one with Down syndrome ; you can read about it everywhere .
I do n’t appreciate the reaction to her having a child with Down syndrome either .
It ’s been touted like some kind of heroic act : she learned that he would be born with Down syndrome , but she chose to keep him anyway .
It ’s obnoxious that Palin and McCain have co-opted for their benefit the very language that they wish to deny all other women .
Palin did n’t choose to keep her child because she does n’t believe women have that choice .
Just as her pregnant 17 - year - old daughter did n’t choose to go forward with gestation either .
It ’s disingenuous and offensive to revere Palin and her family for their choices , while also lauding them for their anti-choice , “ family values ” politics .
While I certainly disagree with nearly all of Palin ’s politics and I do n’t think an inexperienced governor caught up in a family scandal is a positive representation of women in government , I do n’t want to see her become the target of sexism for the remainder of the campaign .
That ’s why I find the assertions that her daughter ’s pregnancy should be withheld from campaign discourse and that Joe Biden will need to “ be a gentleman ” during the vice presidential debate so troubling .
If Palin were a man whose 17 - year - old daughter got pregnant , no one would be saying that we should n’t bring personal hardships into the political discourse .
Yes it ’s too bad that this young girl has been pulled into the spotlight during what can only be a frightening and difficult period , but that ’s the price of her mother ’s political success and Bristol Palin ’s pregnancy can do much to inform us of what Sarah Palin would do support all of America ’s young mothers , what she thinks about comprehensive sex education and how this personal experience will affect her politics .
Sure Bristol Palin has the help of a supportive family , but what about all the teenage mothers who do not ?
In light of her daughter ’s pregnancy , what would Sarah Palin like to do for other young mothers ?
I think it ’s an important question and the answer should n’t be kept private .
As for the issue of the Palin versus Biden debate , the notion that Biden will need to be less aggressive is one the most sexist sentiments I ’ve ever heard .
If women are going to be major players in American politics , then they need to be treated as equals .
If Palin is n’t prepared to be president should something happen to McCain , then that ’s something voters should know .
She should n’t be able to skate by simply because she ’s a woman .
That does nothing to promote equality and does a huge disservice to all women politicians .
She ’s certainly not so fragile that she can’t handle some hard - hitting criticism .
I hope that Biden will force her to answer for her lack of experience as well as her anti-women and anti-environment politics .
I hope he ’ll be just as aggressive as he would be with any male candidate .
That ’s really what women need .
Because here ’s the thing about breaking through glass ceilings : if you really want to shatter glass , you have to be willing to bleed .
Is there anything duller than a Man Utd / Liverpool / Chelsea / Arsenal " fan " – who invariably has been to one , maybe two live games at best – telling you how much they care about " their " team .
Yawn .
These people would have always bought FIFA over Pro Evolution Soccer .
Generalisation ?
Sure , but you get the point .
PES was always the game for real fans of real teams , not just the Sky / 100 k - a- week / Prem only mainstream .
But things might , just might , have changed .
This year 's FIFA is a bit of a revelation .
Ok , I 've only had code for a couple of days but so far so good .
Off the pitch there are host of new features that show promise .
I signed up to the Live Season service - one league is free - which supposedly adds real life current form data into the game .
It 's too early to really tell if it makes a difference but Spurs and Newcastle both lost the games I played so maybe there is something to it .
General online play is pretty much lag free too – a joy compared to the laggy mess of PES online .
The new 10 vs 10 online * sounds * fantastic but I 've yet to find enough players to test it .
This should n't be a problem from today so fingers crossed .
But FIFA has never had a problem with matters off field .
It 's the on pitch stuff that needed fixing .
The good news then is that FIFA '09 is the closest one yet to replicating the fluid action seen in PES .
It 's not quite there yet – the players still do n't feel * quite * as responsive as they do in PES – but the difference is far less marked than before .
And when it comes to heading FIFA wins out , with players having much more control on where they place their header .
I scored a fantastic glancing header last night against Portsmouth .
Ok , it may have been a consolation for the Southampton but it felt like a winner .
The game looks the part too – with players pointing where they want the pass and the bigger players running in the style of their real - life counterparts .
Up close though the players still look like freakish zombies .
And get out of the top leagues and likenesses go out the window .
Yes , I 'm sure most punters wo n't care that Adam Lallana looks nothing like he does in real life but when you have the correct kit , team and player names it does annoy .
Maybe this will be sorted by FIFA 2019 ?
But do n't go thinking your PES / FIFA decision is a no-brainer .
After a relatively disappointing – but still highly playable – couple of PES releases , 2009 is threatening to be a return to form .
From what I 've played – the demo is out now – the game feels slightly slower than last year , which has to be a good thing .
Defending seems easier and more effective now , which comes as a relief after the goalfest that was 2008 .
Final PES code should be out soon – the game is released in a fortnight – so judgement will have to wait .
But it 's going to be a tough call .
FIFA or PES then – which team are you supporting this year ?
LOS ANGELES , Aug. 22 ( UPI ) --
A federal court in California ruled Friday that authorities may not conduct strip - searches without reasonable suspicion the subjects are carrying contraband .
A three - judge panel of the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals ruled in a lawsuit challenging the practice of San Francisco city and county authorities of strip - searching inmates as a means of deterring drugs and weapons traffic in jails , the Los Angeles Times reported .
The panel found the practice is a violation of constitutional prohibition on unreasonable search and seizure .

The ruling also cleared the way for lawsuits against San Francisco County Sheriff Michael Hennessey , the newspaper said .
" The intrusiveness of a body - cavity search cannot be overstated , " Judge Sidney R. Thomas wrote .
" To justify such a dehumanizing and humiliating invasion of privacy , there must be some reasonable relationship between the criteria used to identify the specific individuals eligible for a strip - search and the interest in preventing the introduction of contraband . "
The decision upheld a 2005 lower court ruling that found the plaintiffs in the case were considered a separate class of arrestees from suspects whose criminal records constituted probable cause they might be carrying contraband .

Schoolboy Felix Kramer 's new term lasted less than an hour yesterday - when he was sent home for having a one - inch ginger fringe .
Felix Kramer , 15 , had the end of his brown hair bleached by the sun over summer .
Teachers admitted he had not dyed it in breach of school rules but booted him out anyway until he gets it trimmed .
The GCSE pupil said : " I was five minutes late for assembly when a senior teacher took me aside and said I had to go home .
" I did n't even have time to see my friends .
" I was shocked as my hair goes like this every year , but they said it was n't acceptable .
" My dad was quite angry about it and said I should get the school to pay for my haircut . "
His father Ian furiously phoned up Isleworth and Syon School in West London , but teachers refused to budge .
The graphic designer , 58 , fumed : " They accepted he had n't dyed his hair but said he could n't come back until it was sorted out .
" They were apologetic but told me rules are rules .
I could n't believe it when they told me .
" Felix 's fringe goes blond and ginger in the sunshine and the same happens to me .
" Perhaps it would be different if he had dyed it blue or green , but it 's all natural .
" He 's not the kind of lad who would kick up a fuss but he 's worried he will be disadvantaged as this is an important exam year for him . "
However , school head Euan Ferguson defended the tough stance .
Mr Ferguson insisted : " We are very proud of the high standards we set .
" My staff and I continue to monitor these standards on a daily basis to ensure that our high expectations are met . "
Felix will return next week after getting the fringe trimmed .

There ’s quite a bit or worrying lately in Europe about the creeping Islamization that is occurring .
We are seeing the slow buildup of tensions between the values that most European hold and the barbaric ones proposed in the Qu’ran and the Hadith .
Many people , including me , are quite annoyed in the way that our governments and international bodies are not only caving in to Islamic demands , but are actually protecting their hateful doctrine .
Instead of seeing a strong secular opposition to the demands of religious extremists , they are given even more rights and more entitlements than any other European .
What most appals me is how the politicians who are supposedly representing us , instead cater to the religious extremist vocal minority , simply because it ’s a very nice chunk of a voting block .
Now that would n’t be much a problem if our republics were working as they should , as these pandering leaders could simply be voted out , but this is not really happening .
The same parties who at one point decide to pander to religion , end up simply getting re-elected , if not in the next election , at the one after that .
Why ?
Because people will still vote them up , no matter what they do .
It ’s because people do not vote with their mind and based on previous events .
They vote with tradition .
This is one the biggest failing of the bipartisan system most countries have ended up with .
You have two political parties that are neck - to - neck in each election .
This is because the largest part of the electoral body traditionally votes for the same party and most are under the impression that not voting either , is the same as voting for the opposition .
Because these parties are so close in vote - count and because the traditional members of each cannot be swayed , the only ones who can tip the scales are the undecided voters .
Politicians thus tend to focus on appeasing what looks like the largest party of undecided which might make the difference in the next election .
The vocal minorities , always look as if they have a much bigger sway and presense than reality .
Religious extremists tend to be very vocal .
And there you have it .
When politicians and political parties know that your vote is certain , no matter what they do , they will not look into your interests .
They will try to appeal to the people who ’s votes are not certain to go in either way and since they know you wo n’t dare to do anything else than keep voting for them , they will erode your freedoms , your rights and your society to appease the undecided voters .
The bipartisan system does not work .
It has shown it does not work in every country that has achieved it as the only thing that ends up happening is that power passes from one party to the other and society gets a little bit worse with each election .
In Europe , this situation becomes even worse now .
With the insertion of Muslims as a voting block , the only way to appease them is to push your society closer and closer to Sharia law as they will inadvertently vote for the party that does .
It is this why I am absolutely opposed to voting for any party that acts or has acted like that in the past .
I do not care if not voting for the lesser evil will lead the “ larger evil ” to take place .
I ’d rather vote with my conscience than be a party to the dissolution of my freedom .
If we , as Secularists do not withhold our votes from the politicians who will move us towards theocracy in their attempt to appease the very same people we oppose , then we are consigning simply to the slow death of our societies and our eventual marginalization .
And not only is it our duty not to vote for them , but we should be telling them loud and clear , before and after each election why they did not get our vote .
Perhaps then they might start listening .

A sticking point in talks has been how to verify North Korea 's disarmament The UN 's atomic watchdog says it has removed seals and surveillance cameras from part of North Korea 's main nuclear complex at Pyongyang 's request .
North Korea says the move is part of a plan to reactivate the Yongbyon plant , and that it plans to return nuclear material to the site next week .
The move comes amid a dispute over an international disarmament - for - aid deal .
A similar step in 2002 sparked a crisis which eventually resulted in Pyongyang testing a nuclear weapon in 2006 .
The removal of seals and cameras " was completed today " at the site , a spokeswoman for the International Atomic Energy Agency ( IAEA ) said .
IAEA inspectors will have no further access to the reprocessing plant , she added .
The US said North Korea 's decision to exclude UN monitors was " very disappointing " and urged Pyongyang to reconsider the move or face further isolation .
" We strongly urge the North to reconsider these steps and come back immediately into compliance with its obligations as outlined in the six - party agreements , " White House spokesman Gordon Johndroe said .
He said that Washington remained " open to further discussions " with the North on their obligations for denuclearisation .
The North has been locked in discussions for years over its nuclear ambitions with five other nations - South Korea , the US , China , Russia and Japan .
Symbolic gesture Pyongyang began dismantling the reactor , which can be used to make weapons - grade plutonium , last November .
However , on Friday it announced that it was working to reactivate it .
North Korea was expecting to be removed from the US terror list after submitting a long - delayed account of its nuclear facilities to the international talks in June , in accordance with the disarmament deal it signed in 2007 .

It also blew up the main cooling tower at Yongbyon in a symbolic gesture of its commitment to the process .
However , the US said it would not remove North Korea from its list of state sponsors of terrorism until procedures by which the North 's disarmament would be verified were established .
North and South Korea have been technically at war since their 1950 - 53 conflict ended without a peace treaty .
Fuel rods Experts say the Yongbyon plant could take up to a year to bring back into commission , so there will be no new plutonium production for a while .
However , there is plenty already available in the form of the spent fuel rods , taken from the reactor core , but only removed to a water - cooled tank on the site , says the BBC's John Sudworth in Seoul .
It is this nuclear material that will now be introduced into the separate plutonium reprocessing plant , according to the information given to the IAEA .
Some estimates suggest the fuel rods could yield about 6 kg ( 13lbs ) of plutonium within two to three months - enough for one atomic bomb to add to North Korea 's existing stockpile .

A number of former WaMu employees told ABC News that WaMu 's execs were eager to profit from the housing boom and lending frenzy and ignored risk managers ' warnings .
They allege that this behavior is responsible for the bank 's failure .
ABC News :
These former WaMu employees , 89 of them who worked throughout the company and around the country , described a bank eager to profit from a housing boom and lending frenzy that seemed to have contributed to the credit crunch and housing bust now plaguing the economy ...
In court documents , the insiders said the company 's risk managers , the " gatekeepers " who were supposed to protect the bank from taking undue risks , were ignored , marginalized and in some cases , fired .
At the same time , some of the bank 's lenders and underwriters who sold mortgages directly to home owners said they felt pressure to sell as many loans as possible and push risky but lucrative loans onto all borrowers , according to insiders who spoke to ABC News ...
Dale George , a former WaMu senior risk manager who spoke exclusively to ABC News , explained that risk managers are like the brakes on a car .
WaMu executives " took the brakes off and drove over a cliff , " he said .
“ Are you browsing Slashdot in Emacs ? ” , W- asked me after he glanced at my screen .
With Emacs ’ reputation for including everything _and_ the kitchen sink , you probably wo n’t be surprised to hear that there ’s more than one way to surf the Internet using your text editor .
With today ’s Javascript - and image - heavy websites , it can be hard to believe that anyone would use a text - based browser with limited support for many of the things we take for granted .
Still , a Web browser in your text editor can be surprisingly useful .
Here are some of the reasons why you might like it :
Browsing is faster and less distracting .
Forget flashing ads , garish colors , and large images .
When you surf the Web in Emacs , you can focus on reading , and you can use all the typical Emacs shortcuts for navigating around .
You can view images when you want to .
If you need to see something that Emacs does n’t support , you can easily open the current page in an external Web browser .

If you need to see something that Emacs does n’t support , you can easily open the current page in an external Web browser .
You can integrate it into your work .
With a little bit of Emacs Lisp , you can quickly look up information on the Web based on what you ’re currently working on .
For example , PHP mode comes with a shortcut that lets you look up the current function ’s documentation in the PHP manual .
You can look up bug report details , dictionary definitions , and Wikipedia pages with minimal typing , too .
If you use Emacspeak , you can set up the web browser to speech - synthesize more than what ’s displayed on screen .
The more you use Emacs , the more benefits you get from the integration .

You can customize everything .
You can customize your Emacs experience quickly and easily , and if you spend a lot of time on the Net , you ’ll appreciate having your own shortcuts and functions .
For example , I ’ve completely remapped my keyboard shortcuts to support tabbed browsing on a Dvorak keyboard , and I ’ve defined a few functions to make frequently - used commands much easier .
You can even use functions to process
Web pages and either summarize the information you ’re interested in or make pages more navigable .
It ’s all just Emacs Lisp .

You need less memory .
Why open up a memory - intensive graphical Web - based browser when you ’ve got Emacs open anyway ?
There ’s more than one way to browse the Web in Emacs , of course .
Browse - url is a package that makes it easy to open URLs in your preferred browser or browsers .
For example , you can use it to browse the Web in Mozilla Firefox , and ( of course ) you can use it to browse the Web within Emacs itself .
For browsing within Emacs , you can use w3m.el , an interface to the external W3 M browser , or w3 , a Web browser written entirely in Emacs Lisp .
Of the two , I prefer w3m.el , which is much faster and more featureful than w3 .
Both can display graphics , tables , and frames , and w3 supports stylesheets .
More about Emacs and browsing the Web soon !
Planned projects for this chapter of Wicked Cool Emacs :
*** Project XXX : Browse the Web *** Project XXX : Open the current webpage in an external browser *** Project XXX : Different browsers for different pages *** Project XXX : Toggle between Web and work *** Project XXX : Quick search *** Project XXX : Customize your keymap *** Project XXX : Download files *** Project XXX : Add access keys *** Project XXX : Use social bookmarking *** Project XXX : Typeahead *** Project XXX : Preview HTML *** Project XXX : Read Web pages as news

Sex triggered a life - threatening stroke in a healthy 35 - year - old Illinois woman , her doctors report .
Sex - and orgasm - triggered strokes in relatively young women and men are rare , but not unheard of .
They require a combination of factors and events not unusual in themselves , but which are highly unlikely to occur at the same time .
The 35 - year - old woman 's symptoms were typical of this unusual kind of " cryptogenic " stroke , says Jose Biller , MD , professor and chair of the neurology department at Loyola University , Chicago .
" This young woman ... while having intercourse had numbness on the left side of her face , slurred speech , and weakness in her left arm , " Biller tells WebMD .
" When she was transferred to our care six hours after onset , she was completely unable to move her left arm , her face was paralyzed , her speech was garbled , and she was in a state of panic . "
It was too late to inject the woman with the clot - busting drug tPA , which must be given within three hours of a stroke .
So Biller 's team quickly ran a catheter from an artery in the woman 's groin up into her brain to find the blood clot by angiography .
Once it was found , they had only one option : to apply tPA directly to the clot .
It was a risky decision .
" We did this with a lot of sweat , " Biller says .
The woman 's symptoms began to improve almost immediately ; within an hour she was out of the woods and within 12 hours the symptoms were almost gone .
Today she is well , with only an almost imperceptible fold in the skin under her nose and slight loss of dexterity in her left hand .

There ’s some interesting news coming out of Denver as the Democratic National Convention approaches .
Apparently , the Denver Police are being urged to look the other way and not enforce the city ’s law against marijuana possesion while the convention is taking place :
DENVER – A city drug panel has voted to urge police to refrain from arresting adults for marijuana possession during next week ’s Democratic National Convention , but the cops are n’t necessarily on board .
Lt. Ernie Martinez , the police department ’s representative on the panel , said police , bracing for potentially tens of thousands of protesters during the Aug. 25 - 28 convention , would have more pressing duties than rounding up pot smokers .
At the same time , he said , authorities would n’t ignore blatant flouting of the law .
“ If something occurs in front of us , we ’re going to act , ” he said .

Mason Tvert , a panel member and pot-legalization activist , Thursday delivered a copy of the panel ’s recommendation to Mr. Hickenlooper and police Chief Gerry Whitman , saying that “ we expect police to abide by this very logical recommendation . ”
“ If police expect the taxpayers to cover their $ 1.2 million in overtime during the DNC , it is only fair that they respect the laws adopted by those taxpayers , ” said Mr. Tvert , leader of Safer Alternatives for Enjoyable Recreation .
“ There will be plenty for police to do during the DNC aside from arresting or citing adults who are simply making the safer choice to use marijuana instead of alcohol . ”

tagged development , rails , and tips .
During the development of some web applications in the past , I found myself using various techniques again and again on different projects .
Here 's a collection of five things that I discovered over the time and that I found most useful .
# 1 -- Pimp your rails console with colors , history and tab completion
# 2 -- Using source annotations
# 3 -- Using enum attributes with ActiveRecord
# 4 -- Protect email addresses in views from being gathered by spammers
# 5 -- Avoid sending messages to nil
# 1 -- Pimp your rails console
The rails console is an incredible helper during development .
You can work with models , manually test things or just make changes to your data .
Even in production mode , it comes in handy to use the console to manually change data on a live system if absolutely required .
However , the standard console feels like a dumb terminal ; it has almost no input assistance like we know from e.g. the bash shell .
But luckily , there 's Wirble , a gem that pimps your irb console .
Simply install the wirble gem
# sudo gem install wirble
and put the following into ~/.irbrc
require ' rubygems ' require ' wirble ' Wirble .
init Wirble .
colorize
and your console feels much more comfortable .
You get * Syntax coloring of output .
It 's much easier now to distinguish the different values if you get a larger object as a result * Input history .
All commands entered can be easily browsed and used again with cursor keys and PgUp / PgDn , just like in a shell * Command completion .
Feels like a shell , but it 's a ruby console .
Auto - complete partially entered method names with Tab or see a list of possible methods with 2 * Tab .
Additionally I usually redirect the Rails debug log to the console while developing , so that I can see what database queries are done when using methods on models .
Simply drop the following into ~/.irbrc and the Rails logging will be printed to the console :
require ' logger ' if ENV . include ?
( ' RAILS_ENV ' ) && !
Object .
const_defined ?
( ' RAILS_DEFAULT_LOGGER ' )
Object .
const_set ( ' RAILS_DEFAULT_LOGGER ' , Logger . new ( STDOUT ) )
end
# 2 -- Source annotations
It 's good practice to annotate your code with a comment at places where you know that further work must be done .
Usually these annotations are placed as a comment into the source .
Over time some keywords have been well - established for this purpose .
Namely there are :
TODO -- placed where something is incomplete and more work needs to be done
-- placed where something is incomplete and more work needs to be done FIXME -- placed where it 's known that something is broken and needs to be improved
-- placed where it 's known that something is broken and needs to be improved OPTIMIZE -- placed where optimization needs to be done
Usually , if you use an editor with syntax coloring , comments containing these keywords will be extra highlighted in some way to get your attention .
Additionally , Rails has some rake tasks that search for comments with the above keywords and print lists of all occurrences , including the filename , line number and description ( remaining text after keyword ) of such an annotation .
rake notes : todo -- list all TODO comments
-- list all TODO comments rake notes : fixme -- list all FIXME comments
-- list all FIXME comments rake notes : optimize -- list all OPTIMIZE comments
-- list all OPTIMIZE comments rake notes -- list all of the above comments
# 3 -- ActiveRecord enums
ActiveRecord does not support attribute of type ENUM or SET natively .
An easy way to come around this limitation is to use an integer or a string instead .
I found it most useful to use a string columns , restrict the values by using validations and additionally symbolize the values so that they look more ruby - style .
Validation is pretty easy and values can be symbolized by defining own getter and setter methods .
Lets take a user that can be active or inactive as an example :
class User < ActiveRecord :: Base validates_inclusion_of : status , : in => [ : active , : inactive ] def status read_attribute ( : status ) .
to_sym end def status = ( value ) write_attribute ( : status , value .
to_s ) end end
To make this easier for multiple attributes and work with nil values , I published a plugin that provides a symbolize class method .
Using the activerecord_symbolize plugin , the above becomes as easy as symbolize : status .
More background info on how it works can be found in an older post in my blog .
The activerecord_symbolize github repository does n't seem to work at the moment , since there 's a problem with my github account .
I already notified the github team and hope they 'll address it soon .
# 4 -- Protect public email addresses
If you put your email address on a public web page , you can usually be sure to get tons of spam from there on , because address harvesters will sooner or later visit your page and recognize the email address .
To prevent spam harvesters from gathering your email addresses , you can try to scramble them so that a harvester wo n't recognize them but humans can still read them .
One way of doing so is included in Rails ' view helper mail_to .
mail_to can be used with various options .
: replace_at and : replace_dot will obfuscate the email address by replacing the @ character and dots by the given string .
So using : replace_at= >'( at ) ' and : replace_dot= >'( dot ) ' would output :
me(at) example ( dot ) com
Note that only the displayed address is obfuscated , so the plain address is still present in the href attribute of the link .
Therefore this method is useless in my opinion , since it only annoys visitors with obfuscated addresses and does not hinder harvesters from gathering the link .
The : encode option can be used to encode the email address using : hex or : javascript .
Using : hex will replace all letters of an email address with their hex value , so .com becomes .
%63%6f%6d
Using : javascript is probably the best mail_to can do , since it completely replaces the link with a JavaScript snippet that does not look like a link or an email address anymore .
So the generated page source does n't contain any email link , but if displayed in a browser , the JavaScript executes and shows the email address .
However , I suppose that an email address encoded this way can still be harvested easily , since it can be made visible without actually running the JavaScript .
So I recently wrote a view helper that creates a more complicated JavaScript snippet ( one that cannot easily be reversed without actually executing it ) .
# 5 -- Avoid sending messages to nil
A method usually returns an object if the operation succeeded -- or nil if not .
E.g. ActiveRecord finders return nil , if no matching record was found .
So the returned value has to be checked for nil before doing further actions on it , or you risk calling a method on a nil object ( everybody probably knows the NoMethodError :
You have a nil object when you did n't expect it ! )
So at many places , code looks like this :
user = User .
find_by_username ( ' foo ' ) user .
dosomething unless user .
nil ?
There 's a smart solution of making this look much nicer .
On ozmm , Chris wrote how he defines a method Object#try , that calls a method if it exists and returns nil otherwise .
Here 's the snippet , slightly modified so that it supports multiple parameters :
class Object def try ( method , * args ) send ( method , * args ) if respond_to ?
( method ) end end
With this , the method try can be called on every object ( including nil values , since nil is also an Object ) .
try calls the method named in the first parameter , if it exists and returns it return value or nil if the method does n't exist .
This way , the above case can be handled much easier and more readable :
User . find_by_username ( ' foo ' ) . try ( : dosomething )
You can even cascade it .
Instead of writing :
user = User .
find_by_username ( ' foo ' ) address = user .
address unless user .
nil ?
address .
dosomething unless address .
nil ?
you can now do it this way :
A network printer should not be the target of a DMCA takedown notice from US copyright holders , but researchers at the University of Washington have shown just how simple it is to " frame " any particular IP address as an infringing BitTorrent user .
The researchers used their technique to attract nearly 500 DMCA takedown notices , all of them bogus and some of them targeting nonsensical devices .
Their work shows how difficult it can be to pin down Internet " pirates . "
In a recent paper ( PDF ) , Michael Piatek , Tadayoshi Kohno , and Arvind Krishnamurthy set out to attract bad DMCA takedown notices .
In the course of doing earlier research on BitTorrent in 2007 , the researchers attracted 206 complaints by accident , even though none of their machines were transferring illegal files .
After that experiment ended , they realized that it might be an interesting experiment in itself to try to attract the notices ; if they could be hit with 200 bogus complaints , how easy would it be to " frame " someone else on the Internet ?
Another month of testing brought in 281 more complaints .

To understand what the researchers were up to , it helps to understand how content owners police their works on BitTorrent .
Trade groups like the RIAA and the MPAA generally farm this work out to specialized companies that monitor public BitTorrent trackers for infringing content .
The trackers return a list of peers on the Internet that have at least parts of the file in question .
To bust file - swappers , the companies can take two approaches , " direct " and " indirect " detection .
Direct detection involves making an actual connection to the given IP address and downloading part of the file .
It 's accurate but resource intensive .
The second , and much easier , way to find file - swappers is simply to rely on the IP addresses issued by the tracker .
Once these IP addresses are in hand , the companies turn them over to the trade group , which issues either a DMCA takedown notice or ( in the case of the RIAA ) a " pre-litigation letter " that alerts someone of a pending legal case .
The researchers were able to show that indirect detection is still widely used .
By using 13 different machines on the University of Washington campus , the researchers were able to " advertise our presence as a potential replica without uploading or downloading any file data whatsoever . "
Despite having no infringing content on their machines , the takedown notices poured in , meaning that " direct detection " could not have been used in these cases .
The huge majority of the complaints involved movies and TV shows ; only five takedown notices out of 487 complaints involved music files .
As the experiment showed , BitTorrent tracker data is not always accurate , and in fact can be deliberately planted .
Most trackers simply record the IP address of the machine making requests , but other trackers support an extension that allows BitTorrent clients to " specify a different IP address that the trackers should record in its list of peers instead . "
While designed to avoid problems with things like proxy servers , this is obviously open to abuse .
The researchers used some of these trackers to " frame " one wireless access point , three networked ( and IP - accessible ) printers , and a desktop PC that was not currently using BitTorrent at all .
Each of the machines received DMCA takedown requests .
An attempt to " frame " IP addresses with no machine attached failed to attract any complaints , however .
The researchers conclude that , because of the problems in using " indirect detection , " enforcement agencies " will soon shift to more conclusive methods of identifying users . "
But as they do so , resource requirements intensify .
Instead of making a simple HTTP request to a tracker , direct detection requires a TCP connection and a block transfer that could range into the hundreds of kilobytes .
The researchers estimate that this could mean a 10 - 100 x increase in needed bandwidth .
Their work , they say , is n't intended to " take sides " in the matter , but simply to show how more transparency is needed about the process of issuing DMCA takedowns .
" Without more transparency , " they say , " our concern is that — even if the copyright enforcers fix the problems we 've identified — there might still be many other flaws remaining and new mistakes introduced in the future . "
