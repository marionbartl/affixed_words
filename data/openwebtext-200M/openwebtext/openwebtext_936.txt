A few days ago , a British scientist named Stephen Wolfram launched one of the most ambitious projects in the history of the Internet : Wolfram Alpha , a site which aims to condense all human knowledge into some kind of a thing that you can talk to with your computer .
The site , though still in its infancy , is already being met with really boring articles and complete misunderstanding from all corners of the tech media .
To help you understand this complex new technology , we 've delved into the thing for some first impressions .
First , a simple calculation to demonstrate the powers of Wolfram Alpha : what proportion of the total gross national product of the United States is represented by box office receipts of Ernest Goes to Camp ?
A respectable 0.0001689 percent !
Now , something a little more controversial : how many times could a struggling New Orleans native watch Tyler Perry 's " Diary of a Mad Black Woman " during Hurricane Katrina ?
The answer : Not enough times !
Next , something a little more scientifical : how much Ishtar can a human being endure before his musculature begins to break down ?
Have you pruned your projects lately ?
I started thinking about this last week when I was pruning our rosebushes .
In case you ’ve never done it , pruning plants is more art than it is science .
It requires you to consider both the growth that ’s on the plant at the same time that you think about how you want the plant to grow .
Each limb , each fork , and each new bud requires examination and intuition - based decisions .
It ’s always a bittersweet process for me .
I do n’t like pruning the new growth that is already there , but I know that with a gentle trim , the plant will flourish better than if it just grew wild .
Trimming the right growth causes the to plant divert its precious life energy to the growth that will bring the best blossoms .
How similar we are in the projects and commitments we grow !
Every new project and commitment requires the time and focus that is our creative life energy , and , at a certain point , the upkeep on them is such that it ’s hard to get any one of them to blossom .
Instead of remarkable products and budding relationships , we end up with projects continually half - done , friends / family / clients half - satisfied , and experiences half - lived .
Twenty buds that never got the nourishment they needed never outshines the ten blossoms that did .
Unfortunately , we do not have the gentle gardener that comes through and delicately trims our projects and commitments so that we grow the way we could .
Instead , the sometimes harsh storms of time , money , and stress force us to pare down what we ’re trying to do , and all too often the growth that helps us flourish is the first growth to be broken by the winds – we respond and fix urgent crises and are left with so little energy for the important stuff that those things never get a chance to grow .
The month of May happens to be a great month for pruning both roses and projects .
We ’ve had a few months to see which of our New Year ’s Resolutions or ideals have made progress and which have not .
The mere possibilities of the summer are now much closer to nexus of actuality and impossibility .
It ’s time for us to choose what major things we will grow this year now , in the spring sun , before the summer sun comes and scorches the weak growth into the ground .
Take a look at your projects , someday / maybes , and dreams for this year .
Which are you going to prune so that the others can blossom ?

The last six months have been a wild ride for our economy .
We had our official financial meltdown at the beginning of October .
The first bailout came and went .
Insurance and banking giants continued to fall .
U.S automakers teetered on the edge of failure propped up only by the government .
Millions of jobs have been lost since the start of the year .
A second bailout ( er , stimulus , I mean ) was approved .
Bailed out companies have continued to post dismal results .
And all throughout , economists , financial gurus , and conspiracy theorists alike have been prognosticating such calamities as the collapse of the U.S. dollar , the Second Great Depression , food shortages , and civil instability .
Journalists both fringe and mainstream are becoming more comfortable with revolutionary language .
And yet , with so many storm clouds on the horizon , why does it seem like we have just stalled , like we ’re just sitting on the precipice looking at the view below ?
True , real life change does not happen at the pace of a TV disaster miniseries ( gosh , I miss those ) .
But for all the bad stuff that has happened and the harrowing stuff that ’s being foretold , it feels like we ’re in limbo .
Please note , I am in no way happy about our nation plunging into an economic hellhole .
I like peace and plenty .
But I ’ve done enough homework to know , and I ’ve listened to enough credible voices to know , that we are not going to get a free pass on this one .
I would like to believe that we dodged the bullet and it ’s time to rebuild .
But that belief would in no way be built on logic or reason .
It ’s time to pay the piper and our credit cards are maxed out .
In my opinion , that leaves only one explanation for the current state of limbo in which we find ourselves .
This is the calm before the storm , the deep breath before going over the falls .
So , ask yourself : what do you do when you ’re about to go over the falls ?
Do you make sure your seatbelt is on tight ?
Do you get ready to scream your head off and wait to hit the bottom ?
Do you bail out and swim for shore ?
Do you just enjoy the view , the cool mist of the falls ?
Do you just close your eyes and hope you ’re still alive at the bottom ?
I like to think that I and my neighbors would get out and start swimming the other direction .
By the looks of things , however , most people are looking around , enjoying the view , hoping against hope that someone will turn the boat around .
Yet others are taking a deep breath , preparing to scream their lungs raw .
Which one are you ?
Have a Buck ?
Buy a House !
Desperate sellers in Detroit and beyond unload homes for the cost of Citi share .
March 8 , 2009 -- A dollar does n't buy much these days .
But in Detroit , it can buy you a house .
Real estate agent Ian Mason , who specializes in selling foreclosed properties , showed us a two - bedroom , 800 - square - foot home that his agency recently sold for a single dollar .
" It was n't much of a negotiation , " said Mason , who works for Bearing Group .
" The seller was ambitiously looking to get rid of it . "
That 's because the seller , a bank , was losing thousands each month in maintenance costs and taxes just to hold onto the foreclosed home , which is badly in need of new paint , carpeting , and bathroom fixtures -- but otherwise appears structurally sound and free of mold .
For the price of a can of soda , Mason says it 's a bargain .
" I think you can make this house clean , safe and functional for $ 500 to $ 1,000 , " said Mason .
There are more than 40,000 vacant properties in Detroit , which has been hit hard by the foreclosure crisis , and the median home price is a stunningly low $ 7,000 .
In many neighborhoods , homes that were fetching $ 75,000 just three years ago are now selling for ten cents on the dollar or less .
" Some of the homes are very nice .
Some of them are falling over , " said Mason .
It 's not just Detroit .
This weekend , hundreds of foreclosed houses were being unloaded at fire sale prices at giant auctions in New England and New York .
For the banks that are in possession of these properties , time is money .
In Detroit , home prices have plunged more than 20 percent , but sales volume is up 37 percent in the past 12 months .
Many of the buyers are real estate investors like Bret Russell .
The Michigan native has purchased and renovated more than 120 Detroit - area properties , converting them into rental homes .
He works closely with Mason to find the best houses at the lowest prices .
" I see very little risk in the market currently , " said Russell .
" You 're buying a home for $ 10,000 .
If it goes down to $ 8,000 , your rents are very strong , so from a cash - flow standpoint , you 're on steady footing . "
Mason says some residents may not be thrilled about a home next door selling for close to nothing , but he says in the long run it 's the best thing for Detroit 's struggling housing market and economy .
" A neighborhood gets a person or a family inside a vacant house , " said Mason .
" You have kids playing on the block again .
You have people using the stores ... and they bring life back to the neighborhoods . "
" You can only have power over people so long as you do n’t take everything away from them .
But when you ’ve robbed a man of everything he ’s no longer in your power — he ’s free again . "
~ Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn
Collaboration in a negative connotation is an active or passive surrender to an overarching regime which removes freedom and liberty and replaces it with an ordered command mechanism to modify or influence your behavior .
One can consider the British Loyalists in the American colonies to be collaborators and their fates on occasion were quite ghastly .
This can happen as a result of foreign occupation or a replacement of statist forces over time through elections , coups and administrative fiat in an increasingly tyrannical government .
The state is a remora that needs a host to survive and convincing the host that the relationship is beneficial to both parties is the key to the remora ’s survival .
If Obamunism provides one salutary service to the nation , it is a televised demonstration project on how gangster government ( is that redundant ? ) thrives in an environment where the rule of force trumps the rule of law .
On your own counsel , is your acceptance and compliance voluntary or a submission to staying one step ahead of the jailer ?
When the Germans rolled into France in June 1940 , the French Third Republic toppled to be replaced by État Français or the French State .
Vichy France was established after France surrendered to Germany on 22 June 1940 and Marshall Phillipe Pétain removed the administrative center of France from Paris to Vichy .
Southern France remained relatively autonomous from direct German control until 11 March 1942 when the Allies landed in North Africa in 1942 .
The Vichy government ruled over France until the Allied repatriation of the Free French under de Gaulle in June 1945 .
This government was acknowledged and legitimized by the US and Canada , among others , until 23 October 1944 .
During this entire time a guerilla war raged between the French Resistance and the maquis and the Vichy / German government in France and some of its colonial holdings .
The Vichy government was simply the latest installment to provide a stage for the adversaries to engage in real and rhetorical combat .
This civil war had its origins in the 1789 Revolution when the people who did not agree to the destruction of the Ancien Régime continued to sow division resulting in tremendous dissent and disruption throughout French history in the nineteenth century .
During WWII , the behavior and resistance of these anti-Vichy forces was used as an opportunity to expand the state and was responsible for the post - WWII socialist government after the war .
" Historians distinguish between a state collaboration followed by the regime of Vichy , and “ collaborationists , ” which usually refer to the French citizens eager to collaborate with Nazi Germany and who pushed towards a radicalization of the regime . "
The French started taking measures against undesirables such as communists , socialists , Jews , gypsies , homosexuals and other unfortunates who became subject to harassment , imprisonment and death .
The French then reactivated and reflagged various existing concentration camps for the government ’s latest victims .
Stanley Hoffman avers that " an ideologically - motivated cooperation with a Nazi Germany [ was ] seen as the only bulwark against the spread of Bolshevism in Europe " .
Of course , one can note that the opposite is happening in America today .
What is fascinating are the dynamics that animated the relatively easy slide of the republican French into a fascist dictatorship channeling the National Socialist agenda into a French variant that had its moments of viciousness that would do the Nazis proud .
This brought to the surface centuries - old conflicts that had been brewing and finally spasmed violently in resistance organizations against the Vichy regime ’s predations against urban undesirables and rural pockets of refusal , among others .
These sentiments are now starting to manifest themselves in America .
There are people for whom desperate economic times are forcing their ideological hand to reexamine support for a state that seems to work against the wealthy and self - employed , among others .
We have collectivists versus individualists ; rural versus urban ; wise users versus green fascists and an entire panoply of opposition forces starting to coalesce and bringing their fights to the surface .
So what does WWII occupied France have to do with modern America ?
I would suggest we have labored under a Vichy - style occupation since 1865 when a virulent form of government supremacism extinguished states rights in the original Federal system and then the Progressivist virus metastasized under Theodore Roosevelt and the rest is history as the republican vision of a decentralized , localized and minimal government became as anachronistic as the notion of natural rights .
We are all Vichy French in America today .
Your decision is to choose Free American or Vichy French .
Your choice is collaboration with a regime that seeks to control your every behavior and rob your children of their inheritance or to stand athwart history and say enough is enough .
Collaboration is the willful ability to hold your nose and do what you know is the wrong thing .
Collaboration is the desire to look the other way as a large coercive system robs your neighbors ’ against their will and you take advantage of the spoils .
Pushkin said " [ w ] hy should cattle have the gifts of freedom ?
Their heritage from generation to generation is the belled yoke and the lash . "
How many folks do you know ( especially collectivists ) who would voluntarily pay the taxes they do right here and right now if not compelled by the threat of violence ?
How many folks do full stops instead of rolling stops at stop signs ?
How many corporations would willingly staff the accountancy and regulatory requirements imposed on them ?
From the local to the federal level , how many Americans would enforce or comply with the millions of idiotic regulations forced on them ?
What if tens of millions of American workers simply followed Gandhi ’s teaching and crossed their arms and said no more taxes , jail me instead ?
Imagine if state governors stood up and said all the Federal Law enforcement elements within their borders had 24 hours to resign or leave the state ?
There was no foreign vector that caused this to happen as it did in WWII France yet the amount of discontent , disenfranchisement and disgust on the part of Americans matches much of what inspired the resistance organizations .
Depressingly , one of the reasons the French Resistance was such a tough nut to crack throughout the war was that before the Nazi occupation , they had been hunted as Communists by the pre-1940 French regime and had a very robust cellular organization structure .
Many Americans today increasingly look at the machinations in DC and view it as occupation behavior .
Yet why did so many Frenchmen collaborate with the Nazi and Vichy regimes ?
They did it because any other behavior demanded a moral stand or courage they did not possess .
We all have to take a measure of the degree of moral cowardice we are willing to live with .
Of course , this is the story of humanity .
How did the Bolsheviks maintain their stranglehold over tens of millions ?
How do we maintain the fascinating fiction just celebrated on Memorial Day that American foreign wars since 1898 have secured our freedom ?
Was Spain that strong a threat ?
Did WWI stop the Bolshevik victory in Russia ?
Did WWII guarantee a free and democratic Russia ?
All of these can be argued into the wee hours but one observation remains unassailable : war abroad robs and strangles freedom and liberty at home .
Case in point : the United Kingdom now is the most visible and truest testament to Orwell ’s vision in 1984 .
I think the desire to collaborate takes on many guises to include state education systems , mass media and war .
For example , I just had the misfortune of visiting the National World War I Museum at Liberty Memorial in Kansas City , MO .
It is truly a memorial to liberty to note its passing and death but the authors of the title probably did not see the irony .
I have a tremendous interest in military history but age and further research has proved to me that most wars not fought on your own soil tend to rob the invading nations of their own freedoms and liberties at home over time .
Woodrow Wilson ’s campaign slogan in 1916 was “ He Kept Us Out of War . ”
That appears to have been less than true .
Look at the fate of empires in WWI .
Millions of deaths to include one out of three French lads under thirty slaughtered during a four year stalemate and tens of millions of maimed and killed for …more war in WWII .
It was sickening to wander through the facility to witness a gallery glorifying the savaging of young lives and the enslavement of the world afterwards as the communist experiment found its footing and raced to see how many citizens could be robbed , jailed , maimed and killed while America raced to make the world safe for big government and soft socialism .
Wilson managed to strangle whatever remnant of American independence and freedom remained which Lincoln may have accidentally overlooked .
We see the ravages of Wilson ’s brownshirts in the American Protective League and the germination of the slow but accelerating crawl to define Americans by national identity instead of the localist roots of village , state and region .
This , of course , paved the way for the patriotic gore we see today of American flags emblazoned on every conceivable surface to celebrate war on the world and our own enslavement .
The next ten years in America will be pivotal and I believe the country will dissolve into independent nation states in what is now these united States .
Take the scales from your eyes and read the real history of America .
This is not a country that progresses through government but in spite of it .
The change starts at the bottom with the individual .
The three percent who will resist and work for liberty and freedom changed the prospects of liberty in America during the last half of the 18th century .
Ask yourself : what is the price of my refusal to obey ?
More importantly , how dear will the price be for your children if you simply stand by and watch ?
This is Bill Buppert .
If you are reading this , you are the Resistance .
" The strength and power of despotism consists wholly in the fear of resistance " ~ Thomas Paine
The Best of William Buppert
The big power denunciation of North Korea 's nuclear weapons test on Monday could not have been more sweeping .
Barack Obama called the Hiroshima - scale ­underground explosion a " blatant violation of international law " , and pledged to " stand up " to North ­Korea – as if it were a military giant of the Pacific – while Korea 's former imperial master Japan branded the bomb a " clear crime " , and even its long - suffering ally China declared itself " resolutely opposed " to what had taken place .
The protests were met with ­further North Korean missile tests , as UN ­security council members plotted tighter sanctions and South Korea signed up to a US programme to intercept ships suspected of carrying weapons of mass destruction .
Pyongyang had already said it would regard such a move as an act of war .
So yesterday , nearly 60 years after the conflagration that made a charnel house of the Korean peninsula , North Korea said it was no longer bound by the armistice that ended it and warned that any attempt to search or seize its vessels would be met with a " powerful military strike " .
The hope must be that rhetorical inflation on both sides proves to be largely bluster , as in previous confrontations .
Even the US does n't believe North Korea poses any threat of aggression against the south , home to nearly 30,000 American troops and covered by its nuclear umbrella .
But the idea , much canvassed in recent days , that there is something irrational in North Korea 's attempt to acquire nuclear weapons is clearly absurd .
This is , after all , a state that has been targeted for regime change by the US ever since the end of the cold war , included as one of the select group of three in George Bush 's axis of evil in 2002 , and whose Clinton administration guarantee of " no hostile intent " was explicitly withdrawn by his successor .
In April 2003 , North Korea drew the obvious conclusion from the US and British aggression against Iraq .
The war showed , it commented at the time , " that to allow disarmament through inspections does not help avert a war , but rather sparks it " .
Only " a tremendous military deterrent force " , it stated with unavoidable logic , could prevent attacks on states the world 's only superpower was determined to bring to heel .
The lesson could not be clearer .
Of Bush 's " axis " states , Iraq , which had no weapons of mass destruction , was invaded and occupied ; North Korea , which already had some nuclear capacity , was left untouched and is most unlikely to be attacked in future ; while Iran , which has yet to develop a nuclear capability , is still threatened with aggression by both the US and Israel .
Of course , the Obama administration is a different kettle of fish from its ­predecessor ; it had earlier floated renewed dialogue with North Korea and has made welcome noises about nuclear disarmament .
Whether such talk was ever going to impress the cash - strapped dynastic autocracy in Pyongyang – which had had its fill of broken US commitments and the new belligerence from its southern neighbour – seems doubtful .
In any case , having gone so far , it was surely inevitable the regime would want to rerun its half - cocked 2006 test to demonstrate its now unquestioned nuclear power status .
Yet not only has America 's heightened enthusiasm for invading other countries since the early 1990s created a powerful incentive for states in its firing line to acquire nuclear weapons for their own security .
But all the main nuclear weapons states have , by their persistent failure to move towards serious disarmament , become the single greatest driver of nuclear proliferation .
It 's not just the breathtaking hypocrisy that underpins every western pronouncement about the " threat to world peace " posed by the " illegal weapons " of the johnny - come - latelys to the nuclear club .
Or the double standards that underpin the nuclear indulgence of Israel , India and Pakistan – now increasing its stock of nuclear weapons , even as the country is rocked by civil war – while Iran and North Korea are sanctioned and embargoed for " breaking the rules " .
It 's that the obligation of the nuclear weapons states under the non-proliferation treaty – and the only justification of their privileged status – is to negotiate " complete disarmament " .
Yet far from doing any such thing , both the US and Britain are investing in a new generation of nuclear weapons .
Even the latest plans to agree new cuts in the US and Russian strategic arsenals would leave the two former superpower rivals in control of ­thousands of warheads , enough to wipe each other out , let alone the smaller fry of global conflict .
So why North Korea , no longer even a signatory to the treaty and ­therefore not bound by its rules , or any other state seeking nuclear protection , should treat them as a reason to disarm is a mystery .
Obama 's dramatic plea for a " world without nuclear weapons " in Prague last month was qualified by the warning that such a goal would " not be reached quickly – perhaps not in my lifetime " .
But a lifetime is too long if the mass proliferation of nuclear weapons is to be halted .
Earlier this month , ­Mohammed ElBaradei , the outgoing director general of the International Atomic Energy Agency , told the Guardian that without radical disarmament by the major powers , the number of nuclear weapons states would double in a few years , as " virtual weapons states " acquire the capability , but stopped just short of assembling a weapon , to " buy insurance against attack " .
This is what Iran is widely assumed to be doing , despite its denial of any interest in acquiring nuclear weapons .
And the evidence is now growing that the US administration is heading towards harsher sanctions against Tehran rather than genuine negotiation , as two former US national security council staffers , Flynt and Hillary Mann Leverett , argued in the New York Times at the weekend .
That was also the message Hillary Clinton sent to North Korea last month when she said talks with the regime were " implausible , if not impossible " .
In fact , they are desirable , if not essential .
Obama has set out a positive agenda on the nuclear test ban treaty , arms cuts and control of fissile material .
But if , instead of slapping more sanctions on Pyongyang , the US were to push for far broader negotiations aimed at achieving the long - overdue reunification of Korea , its denuclearisation and the withdrawal of all foreign troops – now that would be a historic contribution to peace .
9 mm vs. 38 Special : The Cartridges & the Guns
While reading comparisons of the pros and cons of the pocket 380 versus the snub 38 I noted a reader suggesting a comparison of the pocket nines to the popular 38 compact revolvers .
Other projects and responsibilities prevented my starting work on such an article immediately , but during the interim I decided that it might be better to compare not only the pocket nines to the pocket 38 Specials , but the service size handguns in both calibers as well .
I will do the best I can in this regard with the firearms that I have available .
I also recalled reading that some state that the 38 Special and the 9mm are equivalent in terms of " stopping power " .
We 'll take a look at some actual average velocities from both calibers from different length barrels and see what the truth actually is and how much is just hot air .
Bullet weights will be as close as possible between the two calibers for a more meaningful comparison .
Also included will be reasons for my own selections between the two and why .
These are not necessarily recommendations or even suggestions , just my own admittedly subjective observations .
The reader can decide if he or she agrees and make his or her own decisions .
I have little use for the " only - my - way - is - right " approach since I do n't have the wisdom necessary to make all decisions for all people .
What is " right " for me does n't necessarily mean that it is right for anyone else .
Let me add that after many years of trying about everything that was available , I made my own decisions .
I listened to others in many cases and others I ignored , but in the end I wound up with what works for me .
Please let me suggest that this approach be considered in your own decisions .
Often compared are 380 and 38 Special handguns as exemplified by the Bersa Thunder and Colt Agent shown above .
The merits of the revolver vs. semiautomatic are often mentioned , but sometimes the debate centers only on the ballistic capabilities of the cartridges .
I have approached the subject myself in the articles linked here for those who might have interest :
http://i5.photobucket.com/albums/y171/hipowersandhandguns/NorincoRust2.jpg
http://www.hipowersandhandguns.com/Comparisonof9x18mmMakarovetc.htm
This article 's focus is the 9x19 mm compared to the .38 Special not only in different loads and bullet weights , but from different barrel lengths for both .
Pictured are " new " vs. " old " technology cartridges .
The 9 mm shown is Winchester 's 127- gr.
+P+ Ranger , a round considered one of the best in that caliber .
The .38 Special is a Remington 158 - gr. LSWCHP +P , an example of the " old " approach .
Often referred to as either the " FBI " or " Chicago Load " , many still consider it to be one of the best .
( It is sometimes erroneously called the " Treasury Load " .
The Treasury Load incorporated a 110 - gr. JHP at high velocity . )
Also discussed will be such things as magazine / cylinder capacity , ease of reloading , as well as other advantages and disadvantages of the handgun types encountered when choosing between the revolver and the semiautomatic .
Felt recoil and practical accuracy will also be covered .
We will look at the compact nines such as the Glock 26 and compare them to the typical J - frame 1 7/8 " .38 as well as the 3 " and 4 " barrel revolvers .
Larger 9 mm pistols will also be compared with respect to actual chronographed ballistic performance as well as handling characteristics .
When comparing barrel lengths on revolvers versus automatics , we find that with the latter we must take the chamber into account .
Revolver barrels are measured from the muzzle to the face of the forcing cone .
For example , an S&W Model 638 has a listed barrel length of 1 7/8 " and the bullet actually does actually accelerate that distance .
A Colt 9 mm Commander has a listed barrel length of 4 1/4 " , but the 9x19 mm case length is right at 0.75 " .
This is because the chamber is included in the barrel length .
Therefore , the actual effective barrel length is 3.5 " in this example .
Simply deducting case length is not exact .
Some bullets engage the rifling quicker than others due to their shape , but deducting 3/ 4 " is close enough for general discussions .
. 38 Special : Like the 9 mm , this cartridge hit the ground circa 1902 .
It was intended to improve the ballistic performance of the .38 Long Colt which tossed a 150 - gr. nonexpanding lead bullet at roughly 770 ft/sec .
This had proven ineffective against Moro warriors during our conflict with them from 1898 to 1901 .
Because of this the military pressed the .45 Colt back into service .
In normal trim , the .38 Special would achieve roughly 850 ft/sec with a 158 - gr. lead bullet from a 6 " barrel .
I leave how much of an improvement this actually was to the reader .
It should also be noted that the service rifle at the time ( .30 - 40 Krag ) had some failures to " stop " the determined Moros .
I suspect that the .45 Colt did too , but can certainly see a larger diameter nonexpanding bullet at 250 - 255 - grains at roughly 900 ft/sec offering more potential as a " stopper " than the .38 Long Colt .
It was the .38 Long Colt that " failed " against the Moros , not the .38 Special .
( Frankly , I suspect that its performance would not have been significantly better with the ammunition available at that time . )
The .38 Special has a maximum length overall of 1.550 " and case length is 1.155 " .
SAAMI pressure for the standard pressure load is 17000 PSI .
The +P has a ceiling of 20000 PSI .
There are no SAAMI specifications for + P+ , but there are some +P+ rounds available in this caliber .
Bullet diameter is usually .356 to 0.358 " .
I have not researched the history of this cartridge .
Some say that it was originally offered in black powder and the switch to smokeless necessarily involved keeping pressures low because the existing guns could n't handle much more pressure safely .
Others say that it was simply because of the quality of some .38 Special revolvers .
I actually do not know the definitive answer as I do n't shoot this round in poorly made revolvers and am not a real " historian " of either handguns or ammunition .
Regardless of the real reason , the safe working pressures for this round are among the lowest and this is the reason that the physically larger .38 Special cartridges ' velocities are usually considerably lower than those of the high - pressure 9 mm round .
The .38 Special served this nation 's police from federal agents to town marshals for the biggest part of the last century .
I carried a 4 " S&W Model 10 as my first duty gun when a fledging police officer .
The caliber is still popular today , but more so in the compact snubs than the full service type revolvers that used to fill lawmen 's holsters .
It has a reputation for accuracy .
I 'm not sure how much of that is due to the fact that its recoil is mild from the service weapon and most police matches were fired with lighter loaded target wadcutters .
I do know that some of the tightest groups from any service guns I 've ever seen or shot were done with the 4 " S&W Model 10 Heavy Barrel and Model 15 Combat Masterpiece .
The popular bull barrel match guns were scary accurate in competent hands .
Seen more often today in snub nose form , the guns still possess more intrinsic mechanical accuracy than most of us can make use of , but are harder to shoot accurately .
This is due to shorter sight radius and the lighter weight of the guns themselves .
The lighter snub may be much easier to carry than its heavier counterpart , but this works against its practical accuracy .
However , these lightweight revolvers are certainly accurate enough for close - in defensive shooting in practiced hands .
It has been my observation that most folks opine that these guns are harder to shoot accurately than many of the .380 automatics and believe that this is a major reason that the .380 also remains popular .
Unless shooting the super small 9 mm pistols , felt recoil is usually not mentioned as being " bad " , but the sharp recoil of the hot - loaded Airweight ( or lighter ) snub often is .
The J - frame Model 638 is smaller and lighter than the all - steel K - frame 3 " Model 64 .
Weighing less and with usually smaller stocks felt recoil is greater than with the heavier / larger revolver even if the same ammunition or load is being used .
One is easier to hide , has shorter sight radius , and has greater felt recoil .
The other is slightly harder to conceal , larger , weighs more , but is almost always easier for most people to shoot well .
Its felt recoil is not usually objectionable even though it will normally produce higher velocities than the 1 7/8 " J - frame .
At one time , the full - size .38 Special revolver was routinely seen in police holsters either by choice or regulation and not surprisingly , in more than a few dresser drawers for home defense .
Some were snubs , but I 'll bet many more were 4 " versions just like those toted by US police .
Today I 'll wager that the 3 " K - frames and lightweight J - frame versions are the more popular .
The S&W Model 10 Heavy Barrel was once very commonly used by police officers .
Most were seen in square butt configuration .
My first duty revolver was just such a gun .
The Model 10 pictured was made more recently and with the round butt frame .
The duty size .38 revolver is not as popular as in decades past .
For those interested , here are some thoughts on that topic :
http://www.hipowersandhandguns.com/Humble%2038%20Special.htm
As is true with most things , there are both strong and weak points to the more compact .38 snubs versus the larger revolvers in that caliber .
Where the J - frame or its equivalent is easier to conceal , it can be harder to shoot accurately and felt recoil is greater .
The service style revolvers are easier to shoot accurately , have less felt recoil and greater velocity when the same ammo is used in it or the snub .
The snub nose may have equivalent potential accuracy , but its practical accuracy can be less if not used in skilled hands .
The same arguments hold true for the 9 mm semiautomatics , but it does seem that there are fewer complaints concerning felt recoil with the smaller nines than with the lightweight .38 Special snub nose revolvers .
Let 's take a look at some average velocities from the .38 Special guns .
Figures listed are based on ten shots fired ten feet from the chronograph .
Where possible , the same load 's velocity is shown from different length barrels .
Not all listed loads have such commonality .
In some instances , the average velocity will be only from one revolver and barrel length .

Discontinued load ** Guardian Gold line of JHP *** Law Enforcement Restricted HydraShok load
In no case did we see a bullet over 125 grains break 1000 ft/sec .
The Corbon 110 - gr. DPX ( standard pressure load ) did by over 100 ft/sec , but this bullet has been a problem for me in some snub revolvers .
Approximately 20 % were not stable and did not strike targets at 15 yards straight on .
( It should be noted that all of the standard pressure DPX loads worked perfectly from 3 and 4 " barrels .
This load is no longer available and has been replaced with a + P version .
Perhaps this will boost velocities just enough to get perfect stabilization in the 1 7/8 " barrels . )
Without question , the speed demon of this bunch was the discontinued super - hot +P+ Corbon 115 - gr. JHP .
This load used 9 mm 115 - gr. Sierra Power Jacket Hollow Points loaded in .38 Special cases .
This stuff is hot .
Though ejection was fine in each revolver I tried it in , I personally do not use it in my J - frame .38 Specials .
I think it 's just too much and will either have excessive flame cutting , frame stretching , or crack the forcing cone .
Felt recoil is sharp and memorable from the little aluminum frame snubs , but it is not bad from the K - frame revolvers .
Generally speaking , we can expect velocities from about 850 to 950 ft/sec from most 110 and 125 - gr. loads in .38 Special depending upon barrel length and whether the load is standard pressure or +P .
( For what it 's worth , I continue to use the Remington 158 - gr. LSWCHP +P in my .38 Specials regardless of barrel length .
The reasons are pretty simple .
It has a good reputation among those who have used it in fights and I find that the fixed revolver sights are usually pretty well " on " for this load .
It is reported to have less than stellar expansion when fired into 10 % ballistic gelatin after passing through 4 layers of denim , but this " problem " goes away in the 3 and 4 " barrels .
It appears that the 800 - 840 ft / sec range it travels from my snubs is right on the ballistic edge of reliability through barriers .
At speeds closer to 900 ft/sec this load reportedly works fine in such tests .
I leave it to the reader to decide how much merit the " denim test " does or does not have . )
Note also the average speeds for the 148 - gr. wadcutter load .
Other brands chronographed very little faster .
These keg - shaped bullets are sometimes recommended for self - protection .
They do have reduced recoil to be sure , but I 'll take my chances with something a bit faster .
Now let 's take a gander at the 9 mm cartridge .
9x19 mm ( AKA 9 mm , 9 mm Luger , 9 mm Parabellum ) :
This compact , high - pressure cartridge hit the ground in 1902 and was adopted by the German navy in 1904 with the army following suit in 1904 .
Since that time , the 9 mm has been the military sidearm round for more than a few countries .
It fought on both sides during WWII in the guise of the Browning Hi Power and has seen its share of bloodletting for all of the last century and into this one .
SAAMI pressure ratings for the 9mm are 35,000 PSI for standard and 38,500 for +P .
There are no designated SAAMI specs for + P+ that I can find .
For that reason , if a person opts for +P+ ammunition I 'd go with one of the " known " ammunition makers such as Winchester , Remington , Federal , or Corbon .
Maximum cartridge LOA is 1.169 " and case length should not exceed 0.754 " .
Though its popularity in the US has grown significantly , the 9 mm has never been as popular here as in Europe .
In this country I believe it has usually played second fiddle to the .45 ACP , a strong favorite amongst defense - oriented shooters .
I also believe that in its better loads , the .45 is more potent than 9 mm , but when the latter is being used with its best loads , I 'm not convinced the difference is staggering and maybe not significant .
Because no two gunshot wounds or people are exactly alike , it is very difficult to quantify " stopping power . "
In service style pistols the 9 mm is a very easy round to shoot well .
In the more compact guns , felt recoil does increase depending upon the size and weight of the pistol .
Some opine that because of the locked breech used in 9 mm pistols , felt recoil is not as sharp as with a similarly sized .38 Special firing warm loads .
I tend to agree but understand that my most " compact " 9 mm is a Glock 26 .
Firing the polymer frame Kahr has not resulted in any unfavorable memories concerning recoil .
Just as the increasing number of states allowing for some form of licensed concealed carry of handguns by private citizens , compact 9 mm handguns are continually being produced and sold because there is a demand .
In this , the compact nine mirrors the popularity of the long popular .38 snub .
Though somewhat eclipsed by service semiautomatics in .40 S&W , .357 SIG , and the ever - popular .45 ACP , the 9 mm in a full - size gun remains quite popular .
I own several and have no intentions of selling them .
The Browning Mk III represents the traditional single - action service pistol while the Glock 26 represents the move toward more compact 9 mm pistols .
In the picture on the right we can see the same G26 compared to the traditional S&W J - frame .38 Special .
The Rohrbaugh R9 is a more compact 9 mm as are examples from KelTec , Kahr , and others .
For those interested in the Rohrbaugh R9 , an article on this gun was contributed and can be read via the link below :
http://www.hipowersandhandguns.com/R9.htm
Though it is by no means limited , there are probably more ammo selections in 9 mm than .38 Special and bulk ammunition for range use is definitely less costly in 9 mm .
In this picture we see the K - frame S&W Model 10 snub with 2 " barrel and the Model 042 with its slightly shorter 1 7/8 " tube .
The all - steel K - frame is significantly easier to shoot if recoil is a problem .
The lightweight compact J - frames are easier to conceal and carry but the cost is increased felt recoil .
My own subjective observation is that felt recoil in the steel frame Model 10 snub is very similar to that of the Glock 26 or steel - framed Kahr K9 .
I do not own any 9 mm revolvers so velocity comparisons cannot be with exactly the same barrel lengths .
I lost interest in the 9 mm revolver when I shot some and experienced difficulty in extracting cases when +P loads were used .
I am told that this does not exist in all 9 mm revolvers .
I 've shot only two and it did in both of those .
One was an S&W , the other a Ruger .
Earlier we described the difference in the way revolver and automatic barrels are measured .
When listing 9 mm velocities , I will give the pistol 's actual bbl length in inches and what I call its " effective bbl length . "
This is simply the total barrel length less 0.75 " .
It gives a more accurate understanding of the speeds attained after passing through that length of rifled barrel .
( Data from the Rohrbaugh is taken from the article linked above . )

I do not have access to all guns and all loads so comparisons will have to be approximate and not as exact as I would prefer .
Nonetheless I believe that at least some " ballpark " observations can be made .
In most cases , bullet weights between 9 mm and .38 will not be the same , but I 'll get them as close as I can .
With that in mind , let 's compare some of the loads .
First , let us take a look at the Rohrbaugh R9 compared to the J - frame snub .
The R9 has an effective barrel length of 2 1/ 4 " compared to the actual 1 7/8 " bbl of the little revolver .
With Corbon 110 - gr. DPX , the J - frame averaged 1077 ft/sec while the R9 obtains the almost identical 1072 ft/sec with Winchester 115 - gr. USA FMJ .
Using standard pressure Federal Nyclad 125 - gr. HP , the snub got 836 ft/sec .
With the standard pressure Speer 124 - gr.
Gold Dot , the Rohrbaugh averaged 1054 ft/sec , a significant increase of 218 ft/sec .
Looking at the super hot Corbon 115 - gr. .38 Special + P+ , we see the snub getting an incredible 1188 ft/sec !
The R9's owner fired no really warm loads , so I have nothing to really compare with , but this is a really stepping out for a snub .
It is an exception to the rule and a load that I 'm leery of in the J - frame revolvers .
Likewise , I do n't have anything in 9 mm in the shortest bbl length to compare to the 158 - gr. load .
Moving up to the Model 64 , recall that it has a 3 " barrel .
That 's fairly close to the 3.11 " effective barrel length of the SIG - Sauer P225 .
From the revolver 's 3 " tube , Corbon 110 - gr. DPX averaged 1118 ft/sec.
From the P225 , Federal 115 - gr. JHP got 1177 ft/sec , an increase of 59 ft/sec .
The Model 64 attained a very fast 1349 ft/sec with the Corbon 115 - gr. +P+ round compared to 1337 ft/sec when the same bullet was fired at +P ( not +P+ ) from the 3.11 " barrel of the P225 .
The difference is only 12 ft/sec ; I think we will agree that for all intents and purposes , the Corbon + P+ .38 from the Model 64 and the +P from the P225 are equivalent .
The Magtech 125 - gr. Guardian Gold JHP +P attained a more typical 927 ft/sec from the 3 " revolver compared to the 1081 ft/sec for Hornady 's factory " Custom " XTP from the P225 , a standard pressure load !
The 9 mm beat the .38 this time by 154 ft/sec and w/o going to +P. From the Glock 26 with its shorter effective bbl length of 2.71 " , the Corbon 125 - gr. + P averaged 1188 ft/sec .
This beat the 3 " Model 64 by 261 ft/sec .
Moving into +P+ , the 9 mm tossed the excellent Winchester 127 - gr.
Ranger Talon JHP at 1215 ft/sec from the P225 and 1246 ft/sec from the Glock 26 .
This amounts to the 9 mm beating the .38 by 288 and 319 ft/sec , respectively .
With the 147 - gr. +P+ Federal HydraShok load from the 3 " wheel gun , we see an average speed of 911 ft/sec .
From the near equivalent 3.11 " effective bbl length of the P225 , Remington 147 - gr.
Golden Saber attained 942 ft/sec .
This difference is only 31 ft/sec and probably meaningless .
The point is that this was a maximum effort + P+ .38 load and standard pressure 9 mm .
Going to the 4 " service length Model 10 , we see that the standard pressure Corbon 110 - gr. DPX reached 1122 ft/sec .
The Browning Mk III 9 mm Hi Power has an effective bbl length of 3.91 " and tossed the 115 - gr. Federal " Classic " JHP at 1177 ft/sec , winning by a mere 55 ft/sec .
The super hot and discontinued .38 Corbon 115 - gr. +P+ sizzled from the 4 " at 1412 ft/sec .
From the slightly shorter effective bbl length of the Hi Power , the 9 mm +P from the same company and using the same bullet averaged exactly 1 ft /sec less .
Magtech 125 - gr. Guardian Gold + P reached 960 ft/sec from the 4 " revolver bbl .
The standard pressure version of Speer 's 124 - gr.
Gold Dot hit 1109 ft/sec from the Hi Power , a gain of 149 ft/sec .
The +P version reached 1200 ft/sec besting the .38 by 240 ft/sec .
The hot Corbon 125 - gr. JHP +P screamed across the chronograph screens at 1312 ft/sec , decisively beating the .38 by 352 ft/sec .
Moving into the 147 - gr. weight common to both calibers , the 4 " Model 10 averaged 917 ft/sec with the +P+ load .
From the Browning , the 147 - gr. Golden Saber hit 1033 ft/sec .
This beat the 4 " revolver by 116 ft/sec and at standard pressures .
What we are seeing is actually greater case capacity but lower operating pressures ( .38 Special ) versus higher operating pressures but smaller case capacity ( 9 m m ) .
I have little doubt that if the ammunition makers had the financial incentive to do the research into better .38 Special bullets and more efficient powders for that cartridge 's capacity and working pressures , we would see some really nice gains in this grand old cartridge .
We are seeing at least some attempts now .
CCI / Speer recently introduced a " short barrel " line of ammunition and this includes .38 Special .
That load is +P and the bullet is a Gold Dot weighing 135 - gr.
Initial reports indicate that it moves about 860 ft/sec from a snub to about 975 ft/sec from a 4 " .
Folks testing it in 10 % ballistic gelatin are reporting that it expands even after passing through external barriers such as denim .
I have not personally tested any of this company 's newest short barrel loads , but will in the near future if at all possible .
The Gold Dot bullet design has proven to be a reliable performer and is a favorite for many shooters .
For those wanting the highest velocities for a given bullet weight , try Corbon .
I have found that most of the time , actual average velocities at least equal and generally exceed their published nominal speeds .
So what 's the bottom line ?
Is the .38 Special just as " powerful " as 9 mm ?
In my observation , the answer is " not usually . "
There are some exceptional loads that do show equivalence with the usually faster 9 mm .
In general , I think it 's safe to say that a +P .38 Special can sometimes be equivalent to a standard pressure 9 mm load in the same ( or nearly the same ) bullet weight .
Usually the 9 mm +P and +P+ will walk away from the .38 + P equivalent from the same or nearly equivalent barrel lengths .
So which is the best to carry ?
I will offer my own choices .
As mentioned early on in this report , my decisions may not necessarily be the right one for another single solitary soul , but they work for me .
In the compact defensive handgun , my first choice remains the J - frame Airweight S&W and almost always the Model 642 .
My primary reason is that in my now tame lifestyle , I find this revolver to be most conveniently carried 24/ 7 in a pocket holster .
Around the house and sometimes away , it may be my primary weapon .
When carrying another handgun , it is still present .
If you think this option might be right for you , I add this caveat :
You absolutely must practice with it if you are to be effective .
The steel frame versions are a bit easier to shoot because the extra weight absorbs a bit more of the recoil , but for me the Airweight aluminum frame revolver works better for pocket carry .
These are not as light as their titanium successors , but neither are they heavy .
More importantly , the Airweight version can be used with lead bullets .
With the even lighter titanium guns , one is restricted to jacketed ammunition only .
Their lighter weight allows lead bullets to unseat themselves in recoil .
This has never been a problem with any of my aluminum framed Airweights .

Over the course of centuries people have been fascinated by claims of ghosts , spirits , and even demons .
Some sightings have been claimed by so many people with the stories being so similar and in some cases identical that the evidence is difficult to ignore .
Open up your mind , if you will , and let ’s take a journey through the world ’s most haunted places .
Edinburgh Castle : Edinburgh , Scotland
No “ most haunted ” list is complete without Edinburgh Castle , as it ’s one of the most well known for its hauntings .
Now maintained by Historic Scotland , the castle and its grounds are open to the tourist and there have been several reports of ghostly encounters .
It ’s important to know that long ago there were prisoners kept in the dungeon of the castle .
They were sometimes tortured and left to die .
Some say that when going through the dungeons , there ’s an unsettling feeling .
This is n’t any proof of ghosts or spirits , but several unrelated guests of the castle have stated the same thing .
The Drummer – History tells us that there was a drummer who guarded the castle from attack .
Many people claim to hear the drumming , but few have seen a ghost .
However , on the rare occasion that the ghost has made his appearance , he ’s in the form of a headless boy in the traditional Scottish dress .
The Canine Graveyard – Edinburgh Castle has one of the only two canine graveyards in Scotland .
Tourists often report hearing barking coming from the graveyard , but have seen no dog .
The Whaley House : San Diego , California , USA
Now open to the public for tours , the Whaley House is said to be the most haunted houses in the United States , with several reports of different ghosts throughout different parts of the house .
Yankee Jim – James Robinson , or “ Yankee Jim ” was the inhibitor of the house before Thomas and Anna Whaley acquired the property .
In 1852 , Yankee Jim was found guilty of attempted grand larceny and was hanged .
Robinson ’s ghost was reported as early as when the Whaleys themselves still lived there , reporting heavy footsteps throughout the house .
Thomas Whaley – Many people have reported seeing Thomas Whaley in the house , normally on the upper landing of the staircase .
A former curator of the house , June Reading stated that a little girl reported a man ( believed to be Whaley ) standing in the parlor .
Anna Whaley – Several reports of the sighting of Anna Whaley have been noted .
She ’s normally seen in the garden or in one of the downstairs rooms .
The Woman in the Courtroom of the House – There ’s no telling who this woman is , but several people have reported seeing a woman lurking in the courtroom .
The Little Girl –
There have been several reports of the sighting of a little girl in the dining room .
There ’s much speculation of who this girl may be , but some say it was a playmate of the Whaley children , though this ca n’t be confirmed .
The Dog – Some say that they ’ve seen a spotted terrier - like dog running though the house .
Interestingly enough , the Wahleys owned a terrier named Dolly .
Bran Castle : Transylvania , Romania
Bran Castle was originally built in the early 13th century , but it ’s most famous for what occurred about 200 years later .
If you ’ve never heard of Bran Castle , you ’ve surely heard of Transylvania and the legends of Dracula .
Well , Bran Castle is also known as “ Dracula ’s Castle ” .
The legend is based on Prince Vlad Tepes , also known as Vlad the Impaler or Vlad Dracula ( “ Dracula ” meaning “ son of the dragon ” ) .
This prince was a defender of Christianity and was best known for impaling an army of 20,000 Ottomans .
Alcatraz : San Francisco , California , USA
Though Alcatraz Island was used for military prisoners before hand , in 1933 it was turned into a maximum security prison for the worst Federal inmates .
If you think back to the time period , it would be no surprise that many convicted mobsters were imprisoned at Alcatraz .
In 1963 , the prison was closed .
Reports in the Utility Corridor – This is the area where one night three inmates were shot several times as they were attempting to escape the prison .
Since then , there have been reports of the sounds of clanging in this corridor .
Cell 14D – D Block was where they put prisoners in solitary confinement .
There have been reports of a lot of eerie activity in cell 14D even today as visitors go through , but perhaps the most perplexing occurrence happened while Alcatraz was still a prison .
In the 1940s , an inmate in that cell was heard screaming that a creature was killing him .
The next day , guards found him strangled to death in the cell .
The Ghost of Al Capone – In Capone ’s last days , he was suffering from syphilis and spent his time at Alcatraz playing the banjo .
Today , visitors as well as employees at Alcatraz have herd the sounds of a banjo playing .
Other Reports – Countless reports of strange phenomenon such as cold spots throughout the prison , sounds of crying , screaming and moaning , and sightings of ghosts of prisoners and military personnel have occurred over the decades .
There have even been incidents reported of people smelling smoke , but no fire is found .
Borley Rectory : Essex , England
The Borley Rectory is unofficially known as the most haunted house in England .
Since the late 1920s , there have been several reports of different phenomenon that include footsteps , whispers , sound of a stage coach outside , and peculiar lights .
What ’s even more amazing is the reports of actual sightings of spirits such as the builder of the rectory , Henry Bull , a headless man , a little girl , and a nun who has been seen in the garden .
Winchester Mystery House : San Jose , California , USA
Perhaps you would n’t know who “ Winchester ” was unless you think about guns .
William Wirt Winchester was the inventor and developer of the Winchester rifle .
Some time after William ’s death , his wife Sarah moved to California and into the house now known as the Winchester house .
The house is now a national landmark and is open to the public , having countless claims and sightings of ghosts .
Some say that they ’ve seen Sarah Winchester herself lurking around the house .
Other claims and beliefs are that some people who were shot and killed by the Winchester rifle haunt the place .
Pollepel Island : Hudson River , New York , USA
Pollepel Island , often referred to as Bannerman Island , is just off the Hudson River about 5o miles north of New York City .
A castle on the island , Bannerman ’s Castle was built by Scotsman Francis Bannerman VI and was used for military surplus .
After Bannerman ’s death in 1918 , many strange occurrences happened of the island .
Two hundred pounds of powder and shells stored in the castle abruptly exploded and blew half of the remains of the castle onto New York City .
Another incident occurred when a ship , the Pollepel , exploded in a storm and crashed into the island .
Many people say that the island is inhabited by goblins that do n’t like visitors .
Is it true ?
Who knows , but the unfortunate occurrences remain a mystery .
The Queen Mary : Long Beach , California , USA
The Queen Mary is an ocean liner that sailed the North Atlantic Ocean from 1936 to 1967 .
It was then retired and permanently docked in Long Beach , California where it ’s now a museum ship .
For decades , the ship is reported to be haunted .
There have been many reports of crying in the nursery room along with other sounds and sightings .
The ship has been explored by many paranormal investigators over the years and still remains a public attraction due to its reputation .
The Bell Farm : Adams , Tennessee , USA
Though strange things still happen on this farm , it all stems from the huge and continuous haunting on the Bell family from 1917 to 1921 .
The ghost that haunted the Bell family was said to have identified herself as Kate Batts , a neighbor of the Bells who had bad business dealings with John Bell over some slaves .
At first , John Bell remained quiet about the hauntings , but soon divulged the information to a friend .
The family was tortured daily by the spirit as they were repeatedly kicked , scratched , punched , and had their hair pulled .
The violence continued until John ’s death which was said to have been done at the hands of the spirit in the house .
Rayham Hall : Norfolk , England
Rayham
Hall is the location of the famous Brown Lady spirit which was said to be caught on film .
This spirit is thought to be a resident of the house , Lady Townshend , the second wife of Lord Townshend .
Rumor had it that she was also his mistress when he was previously married .
The Tower of London : London , England
Also known as “ Her Majesty ’s Royal Palace and Fortress ” , the London Tower is a historic monument in London .
For over more than a century , there have been reports of sightings and strange sounds .
The ghost of Queen Anne Boleyn , beheaded in 1536 for treason , has been seen haunting the chapel .
Other ghosts that have been seen are Lady Jane Grey , Margaret Pole , and Henry VI .
Are these reports of ghosts and spirits true ?
The believers will be believers and the non-believers will most likely stay that way .
However , these phenomenons will always remain a mystery and will peak the curiosity of many generations to come .
A senator has chased a man through the bush in the Northern Territory after an alleged attempted sexual assault .
Police say a 21 - year - old woman was walking along a bicycle path in Katherine , 300 kilometres south of Darwin , when a man grabbed her from behind and dragged her into bushes early yesterday evening .
The woman , who was wearing headphones at the time , fought him off and flagged down a passing car that was being driven by an off - duty policewoman .
A taxi carrying three senators - Nigel Scullion from the Northern Territory , Claire Moore from Queensland and Judith Adams from Western Australia - also saw the woman and pulled over .
" Senator Scullion [ chased ] the alleged offender for some time before losing him in dense scrub , " police said in a statement .
" Senator Moore of Queensland and Senator Adams of Western Australia also stopped to render assistance . "
After police launched a public appeal , a 23 - year - old man was arrested this morning .
He is currently in custody and will be interviewed by police shortly .
Police Commander Jeanette Kerr praised the Country Liberal senator 's efforts .
" This was a quick response provided by one of our off - duty police members , coupled with the actions of Senator Scullion in an attempt to apprehend the offender . "

Earlier this year , a state - of - the art school founded by the Colombian singer and Grammy winner , Shakira , opened amid much fanfare in her hometown of Barranquilla .
Both Colombia ’s President Álavro Uribe and Bill Clinton visited the model $ 6 million school .
The children , many from poor and displaced families , attending the Barefoot Foundation School are the privileged ones .
Boasting nutritionists and psychologists on site , sports fields and well - equipped classrooms , the school is the exception , not the norm in Colombia .
The opening of the school should have prompted a much - needed debate about the lack of investment in education and the overall dire state of education in Colombia .
But it did n’t .
Talking to cabinet ministers and government officials over the years in Colombia is a clear reminder of just how low education is on the pecking order of priorities .
They all talk about development and reel off statistics about economic growth and falling crime rates in parrot fashion .
But education rarely gets a mention .
Few even bother to mention the word education in their political discourses and the issue gets cursory attention during elections .
As a former school teacher in the United Kingdom and Colombia , I am convinced that there is a clear correlation between access to good schools and reducing poverty .
But few government ministers in Colombia appear to believe that a key way to create a growing middle class and reduce the gap between rich and poor is to invest in education and make a serious commitment to provide good - quality teaching to children from low - income families .
Sergio Fajardo , ex-mayor of Medellín and presidential hopeful , appears to be in the minority .
He has a track record of taking education seriously and believes it can be the driving force behind development in general .
“ Whenever I visit a town or village , I always pop in to have a look at the school in the poorest neighborhood , ” Farjado once told me .
“ It ’s a true litmus test that shows whether development and progress is really taking place or not . ”
Other government ministers would do well to follow his example .
Education is not a vote winner in Colombia .
As the low - intensity war against the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( FARC ) continues , the buzz word here is security .
President Uribe ’s success and popularity is inextricably linked to and measured by his hard - line stance against the FARC and military defeats inflicted by the armed forces on the guerrillas .
The government has a clear and defined war plan and spends 6.5 percent of the country ’s GDP on defense .
In comparison , around 5 percent of GDP is spent on education .
Many officials would be hard - pressed to outline the government policy on education .
It ’s no surprise , then , that school drop - out rates remain high .
Worst still , only one Colombian university , Los Andes , is ranked in the world ’s top 500 universities , according to the Times Higher Education list .
The percentage of children attending state primary and secondary schools has increased only marginally from 84 percent in 2002 to 89 percent in 2007 .
In theory , primary and secondary school education is free in Colombia .
But in practice it is n’t .
Every year , hundreds of children are regularly turned away at the school gates because they do n’t have the right uniform , textbooks or pen and paper .
Take a single mother with six children who have been displaced from their home because of the violence .
She often ca n’t afford to buy these essential requisites for all her children to attend school .
Such discriminatory practices should be scrapped and schools doing this should be named and shamed .
Local government funds or loans should be made available to poor families to buy their children uniforms .
It ’s just one solution that could help more children gain access to education , and in doing so reduce poverty in Colombia .

Students at Davenant Foundation School in Loughton , Essex , UK walked out of classrooms that had been equipped with CCTV cameras and refused to attend classes for three weeks until their civil liberties were respected .
Students from the school are hashing over the issues in the comment area for the local news report , in incredibly intelligent , reasonable fashion .

It meant they missed three weeks of studies and led to the drafting of a petition signed by about 150 of their peers .
A father , whose son took part in the walk - out , said the school was wrong not to consult parents about the use of technology which " threatened our children 's civil liberties " …

Eleanor Laing , who has written to the school on behalf of concerned parents , and is due to meet the Information Commissioner to discuss the case , said : " We need to find out if the pupils are happy to be filmed but there are two valid sides to this argument , and I am trying to get to the bottom of it . "
For decades , astronomers have held that the solar system 's innermost planet , Mercury , was nothing more than a desolate world , completely dead and inhospitable to human life .
All that began to change since last October , when the MESSENGER spacecraft started beaming back images of the planet , which it took during its fly - by .
According to the photographs , there is a huge degree of volcanic activities on the surface .
Numerous weird craters have also been spotted , and astronomers have moreover identified a very strange space formation – magnetic tornadoes that rip plasma from the Sun and channel it directly into the surface of the small planet .
“ It ’s definitely not this picture of an ancient world where everything that happened to it happened billions of years ago and nothing happened since then .
We ’re seeing a very dynamic planet that has a lot going on today , ” Washington , DC - based Smithsonian Institution expert Tom Watters said .
“ Up until before Messenger ’s arrival , we were n’t even sure that volcanism existed on Mercury .
Now we ’re seeing it ’s very widespread across the surface , ” Arizona State University astronomer Brett Denevi , who is also the lead author of a study detailing the evolution of Mercury 's crust , added .
The paper appears in a recent issue of the journal Science , alongside many others dealing with the latest fly - by .
The MESSENGER ( MErcury Surface , Space ENvironment , GEochemistry and Ranging ) spacecraft flew past the innermost planet on October 6th , and sent back a number of photographs during its flight .
By combining the latest readings with data sent back by the Mariner 10 space probe , which surveyed Mercury in the 1970s , astronomers have now obtained a 90 to 95 percent complete map of the tiny planet .
These maps seem to show that about 40 percent of the body 's surface has been generated by volcanic activity , Wired reports .
Thus far , experts have believed that Mercury 's surface formed in very much the same way that the Moon 's did .
They held that , from an early magma ocean , lighter rocks emerged to the surface and then solidified in a tiny and brittle solid surface .
Over time , the heat dissipated , and the celestial body became completely solid .
However , our Moon exhibits very little signs of volcanic activity , whereas features created by volcano account for less than half of Mercury 's surface .
On the other hand , the magnetic tornadoes that were just recently discovered “ act as magnetic channels or open windows that allow solar wind plasma from the sun , very fast and very hot , to come right down those field lines and impacts the surface .
People had hypothesized that it was because of day - to - day changes in the solar wind , and how much is able to reach the surface and sputter off neutral atoms .
We may have discovered the answer to that longstanding question , why is the atmosphere so variable : Because reconnection , when it occurs , is just so intense , ” NASA Goddard Spaceflight Center scientist Jim Slavin concluded .
Another place where the two diverge is in the role that myth played for the two cultures .
In Rome , the role of Mythology seems to be primarily one of charting history and the lineage of rulers , while in Greece , Mythology is displaced from modern life by becoming collected narratives of the adventures of gods , goddesses and heroes of all shades .
It almost seems that the more I read about the two cultures , the more I start to think that the comparison between the Greeks and Romans in general can be boiled down to idealistic v.s. realistic , as if the Romans were all about logic and complex , interlocking relationships , the real and the visceral , while the focus of the Greeks was on things artistic , philosophical and cerebral , more concerned with the mind than the body , and that comes through in the differences between their mythologies .
In all , we can see that even though the Romans were able to easily incorporate the mythology of the Greeks into their own pantheon and make the works of their predecessors their own , there were some significant differences between Greek and Roman conceptions of divinity and spiritual practice .
It looks like “ India has its first porn star , ” said Tracy Clark - Flory in Salon .
The only catch ?
She ’s a cartoon .
The online comic strip featuring the sexual exploits of virtual “ horny housewife ” Savita Bhabhi— literally , sister - in - law Savita — draws 60 million viewers every month .
And neither Savita ’s “ buxom breasts nor her raging libido ” fully explain why she ’s hit such a “ cultural hot spot ” in India .
It ’s an Indian thing , said Jason Overdorf in GlobalPost .
Pornography is illegal in India , but 70 percent of Savita ’s readers reside there , and many of the scripts are based on fantasies readers send in .
Savita exploits the tensions between modernity and conservative traditionalism , between India ’s sexual “ repression and the temptation to escape it . ”
The appeal also lies in “ breaking a common taboo , ” said Akela Talamasca in Manolith , and it ’s pretty controversial in India to sleep with your brother ’s wife .
In fact , it ’s a good bet that “ the servers for this enterprise are not located on Indian soil . ”
Still , all the fuss seems a little hard to understand coming from “ the same country that gave the world the Kama Sutra . ”
May 22 , 2009 at 16:01 Tags Python , Qt
Mark Summerfield has a lot of Qt experience , having worked as a technical writer for Trolltech , and co-authored the most popular C++
Qt book , which I 've reviewed a few years ago .
This book is about the PyQt library , which is the Python binding for Qt .
It starts by introducing Python in a few chapters , and then moves on to PyQt , beginning with the basics and eventually reaching quite advanced levels .
If you 're planning to use PyQt , this book is highly recommended .
Not only does it cover the most important aspects of Qt GUI programming with Python ; it also provides numerous helpful examples that are n't just trivial toys , but really show how to achieve useful things with PyQt .
In particular , I 've found the accompanying source code of the book to be a very valuable resource - it contains full source of all the examples ( and solved exercises ) in the book , and serves as a great repository of well - written and idiomatic PyQt code to borrow snippets from .
Qt does n't only cover GUI programming .
It 's a huge and extremely well designed framework for C++ programming , that provides tools for image processing , OS interfacing , data structures , network and thread programming , and much more .
While critical for C++ , these capabilities are less important for Python programmers , who should prefer the Python standard library .
My only nit to pick is that the author seems to prefer the Qt versions of some utilities , which is n't the right approach IMHO .
After all , most PyQt users are Pythonistas looking for a robust GUI platform , not Qt gurus using Python to script their programs .
That said , some of the abilities of Qt do not exist in the standard Python library , and instead of installing them in separate packages , you might be better off with what PyQt has to offer - since the Qt code base it exposes is very robust and efficient .
The " cable - free living room " exists in the same futuristic space that holds the " paperless office " and the " coherent tax code " — and we 'll believe in all of them just as soon as we see them .
But a new consortium called the Wireless Gigabit Alliance says that it can help make the cable - free household a reality within the next few years by providing a wireless gigabit spec with enough bandwidth to transmit HD video .
The plan is like WiFi on steroids , and , just as with steroids , wireless gigabit comes with some serious drawbacks .
These ( fortunately ) do not affect the gonads or cause ' roid rage , but they do mean that you wo n't likely be using wireless gigabit to transmit through walls .
This is an in - room tech only , and therefore not a full replacement for the various WiFi specifications .
The group calls its work - in - progress " WiGig , " which is sort of catchy and has the added benefit of making more sense than " Wireless Fidelity " ever did .
WiGig will operate at 60GHz , which tells you all you need to know about its limitations .
The recently - auctioned 700MHz spectrum is superb for TV transmission because the waves pass so easily through walls .
WiFi began at 2.4GHz and then migrated to 5GHz , still good enough to fill a house .
But WiGig jumps way up the spectrum ladder , which limits it to " gigabit speeds within a typical room . "
60GHz may have its limitations , but it also has one tremendous advantage over much of the spectrum above 5GHz : it 's all wide open space .
60 GHz is widely available for unlicensed use around the world , which means that chipmakers can pump out one set of radios that works in every country without the need for permission .
Given that 's WiGig is a short - range technology , interference from neighboring WiGig devices should be less of problem than it has been for WiFi , which can be problematic in apartments or urban areas .
The WiGig spec is backed by some heavy hitters , including key chipmakers Atheros and Broadcom , along with tech companies like Intel , Microsoft , Samsung , and Dell .
The group wants to have a final spec in place by the fourth quarter of this year , after which we can all look forward to eliminating " the unsightly cables that clutter today 's homes and offices . "
Play it again , Sam
If this all sounds vaguely like the hype that fueled ultrawideband ( UWB ) tech and its years of failed promises , it should ; it 's quite similar .
WiGig appears to be the spiritual successor to the various failed UWB initiatives .
As we noted last year , 60GHz was one of the four or five approaches being pursued by tech companies as classic UWB crashed and burned .
UWB was also going to unwire our living rooms and was also going to move hi-def video .
Numerous companies operating in the space imploded before shipping many units ( and Intel got out of the UWB business ) , but core research and design work was completed that should allow 60 GHz development to proceed quickly ;
WiGig backers are hardly starting with a clean slate here .
The name has changed , and the approach is n't quite the same , but the two technologies share a similar , quixotic goal : simple high - speed connections between every device in the living room .

British Airways has announced the biggest loss since the company was privatised in 1987 .
BA reported a loss before tax of £ 401 m for the year to 31 March , after seeing its results hit by a weak pound and higher fuel costs .
The airline made a revised profit of £ 922 m in the previous year .
BA also offered staff the option of taking unpaid leave or working part - time .
Chief executive Willie Walsh said he would work for no pay in July .
Mr Walsh said : " I certainly want to make a contribution in recognition of the extremely challenging position we face .
This is no stunt .
I do not easily give up anything I have earned . "
Mr Walsh earns £ 735,000 a year .
Finance director Keith Williams , who is paid £ 440,000 , will also forgo his pay for the month of July .
Fuel pressures
Although revenues increased to almost £ 9bn , BA faced a near - £ 3 bn fuel bill .
Mr Walsh said he saw " no signs of recovery anywhere " .
It 's difficult to avoid the impression that at least part of BA 's agony , its descent in just 12 months from record profits to record losses , was of its own making
Robert Peston , BBC business editor
Read Robert 's blog See BA 's share price Fuel costs rose 44.5 % after the price of oil soared last year .
The weaker pound also contributed to rising costs as fuel is bought in US dollars .
But the airline said it expected lower fuel prices to reduce its fuel costs by about £ 400 m in the year ahead .
The results also included redundancy - related costs of £ 78 m .
BA said it had cut more than 2,500 jobs since last summer and added that it was in talks with unions about " pay and productivity changes " .
' Self - inflicted wounds ' Despite BA 's claims that it has been a victim of a downturn in global conditions , analysts say the airline is not entirely blameless for its poor results .
Tom Symonds , BBC transport correspondent
One of BA 's biggest problems is the drop in numbers by 13 % of the airline 's real earners - the business passengers .
The airline is doing all it can to keep them flying , including in recent months a Buy One Get One Free offer .
It is much harder for BA to take on the likes of easyJet and Ryanair when it comes to offering cheap economy seats .
And easyJet in particular is deliberately punting for business passengers forced to travel on a budget .
The other big problem is an old one .
BA 's fuel bills have soared by 44.5 % in the last year .
The real problem is that the world 's airlines buy their fuel in dollars , and the exchange rate against the pound is not good for BA .
Read Tom 's thoughts in full " The first half of the year really was [ a period of ] self - inflicted wounds from the Terminal 5 opening problems , " said airline consultant John Strickland .
Travel writer Simon Calder added that BA had been particularly hit by a fall in premium traffic - business class and first class passengers - which was down 13 % .
" The premium traffic which accounts for half their income has simply dried up , " he said .
" They base their business on the fact that there will be plenty of businesses wanting to fly and businesses are simply cutting back .
" British Airways has been losing £ 7 every second for the past year , which is pretty grim . "
The BBC 's business editor Robert Peston said that BA 's loss was a result of " a lamentable rise in costs " , including engineering and aircraft costs , landing fees and staff costs .
Fewer passengers
Shares in the airline were down 4.5 % to 155 pence in afternoon trading , having lost as much as 7 % earlier in the day .
However , BA said that it had seen a " significantly better " operational performance , and that it had received record customer satisfaction ratings .
The total number of passengers carried fell 4.3 % to 33.1 m .
The results also included the impact of the airline 's first full year of operations at Heathrow Terminal 5 , and BA said more than 24 million passengers had flown through Terminal 5 .
BA added that it had had to take " significant pricing actions " to stimulate non-premium sales , which were broadly unchanged on the previous year .
" Fares have been going down and will continue to be very competitive , " Mr Walsh told the BBC .
" I do n't expect to see any increase in fares in the coming year . "
Tough year ahead BA said the outlook for the airline industry was tough and it would not be paying a dividend this year .
It plans to reduce capacity by 4 % over the winter by not flying up to 16 aircraft .
BA is not the only airline suffering in the global recession , as higher fuel prices and a drop in demand for air travel have affected the whole industry .
Also on Friday , the Emirates group reported a 72 % fall in profits .
On Wednesday Air France - KLM revealed a net loss of 505 m euros ( $ 705 m ; £ 444 m ) in the three months to 31 March , compared with a 534 m euro loss in the same period a year earlier .

Ryan Lanham has been continuing his work on establishing the Core P2P Collaboration Principles , which takes a more ethical approach to P2P .
I ’ve asked him to elaborate on his point of view for our blog .
Ryan Lanham :
“ A peer - to - peer ( P2P ) project is not suitably classified under any mainstream economic system .
That ’s because the motivations behind P2P are fundamentally different than those allowed for in conventional political economic theories .
In a capitalist system , a person acts to maximize profit in a transaction .
Profit is maximized by using property and resources efficiently and by negotiating a sale with a marketplace that has demand and money .
In a socialist system , a commons may exist , but it is controlled by a central authority — typically a state / government — that compels , through a centralized decision hierarchy , participation , rules or a certain pricing structure .
A socialist system tends to emphasize equality of output to those who participate .
Of course these are oversimplifications that do not fit every case but they begin to illustrate major differences .
In contrast , P2P systems optimize growth of a commons , but they do not compel participation nor do they demand equality of use benefits or contribution values .
There is no profit motive as a primary driver .
People participate in P2P systems because they trust that their contributions will be enhanced by other participants at a level that makes their investments of time , knowledge , skill or other resources more productive — generally .
A P2P system is not a charity .
Contributions made to it are not done as a selfless gift or out of an obligation of duty .
However , participation in a P2P system entails a certain commitment to a shared framework and a belief that participants will also contribute to the general benefit rather than “ free - riding ” on the good created by others .
Such trust exists with minimal policing .
P2P systems may have a membership concept , but contribution is not compelled .
Governance , in general , is minimized .
It is unlikely that a whole economy could run by P2P mechanisms .
But that ’s not the point .
The point is that P2P systems such as free software systems , shared data systems ( e.g. Wikipedia ) and other P2P models can exist side by side with socialist or capitalist frameworks equally well .
As with any relatively leaderless organization , P2P systems are driven by the needs , interests and investments of those who participate .
For example , Wikipedia may have endless articles on science fiction characters that no conventionally edited encyclopedia would carry .
That is a richness created by the interests of users .
But it also addresses conventional topics — as demand and interests dictate .
No one is in control to a large extent .
There can be trust and contribution reputations associated with P2P contributions , but the “ spirit ” of P2P is one of sharing and commons building .
Even academic researchers may look first to their own reputation in publishing a work rather than the greater good the research gives to society .
That would not be the case in a true P2P system .
P2P is not a system of personal gain as a primary motivator .
Neither is it a model where social equality and fairness necessarily rule .
Such value accounting is outside the ethos of sharing and contribution that makes P2P systems powerful .
Two areas of P2P research are endlessly fascinating for those interested in conventional political economic systems .
First , what motivates people to lead and contribute often incredible efforts to P2P systems when such work is minimally compensated — at least in conventional terms ?
Second , what impact does the existence of P2P systems have on conventional economic systems ?
Much more work has gone into research on motivation than on the impact of P2P on other economic frameworks .
Clearly a highly productive system like Wikipedia , the Creative Commons or the Free Software Foundation must have profound economic implications , but what are they ?
It appears P2P systems allow markets or government systems to be challenged when they are inefficient , lopsided or otherwise acting poorly or unfairly .
Therefore P2P systems may create permanent efficiencies in economies no matter what their form and structure , just as a well - functioning commons of any sort proves a benefit to the community that works to maintain it . ”

Last December , Rolling Stone published a profile of a Florida man who calls himself “ Master Legend . ”
Who is Master Legend ?
A man “ hellbent on battling evil . ” RS ’s Joshua Bearman ( whose name sounds like he ’s a superhero himself ) explains :
When Master Legend bursts into a sprint , as he often does , his long , unruly hair flows behind him .
His mane is also in motion when he ’s behind the wheel of the Battle Truck , a 1986 Nissan pickup with a missing rear window and “ ML ” spray - painted on the hood .
He and the Ace head off to patrol their neighborhood on the outskirts of Orlando , scanning the street for evildoers .
“ I do n’t go looking for trouble , ” Master Legend shouts above the engine .
“ But if you want some , you ’ll get it ! ”
Then he hands me his business card , which says : Master Legend
Real Life Super Hero
“ At Your Service ”
If there was a flaw in Bearman ’s awesome piece , it was that he did n’t really grapple with the possibility that , as The Dark Knight and Watchmen taught us , the existence of real - life superheroes might lead to the emergence of real - life supervillains .
Unfortunately for us mere mortals , I have some bad news : our worst fears have become reality .
Mother Jones has learned ( via io9 ) that a supervillain going only by the initial “ E ” has put a bounty on the real identity of Shadowhare , a Cincinatti , Ohio ally of Master Legend ( that ’s him in the photo ) .
There ’s not just one villain , either — ” E ” claims to be part of a Consortium of Evil .
( Not to be confused with the Media Consortium , of which Mother Jones is a member . )
The bounty is $ 10 so far ( offered on Craigslist ) , but if we know anything about supervillains , it ’s that they have access to unlimited resources .
This is probably just the beginning .

For a while there a few days ago it sure seemed to some as though the Google Chrome development team had proven again that no matter how much bandwidth is made available , someone , somewhere , for some reason , is going to need or want more .
Instead , what really occurred was a lesson in the everyday risks that can come with free - wheeling corporate blogging .
Here 's what was posted to the Google Chrome Releases blog on Friday by program manager Mark Larsen :
" We were not able to issue a Dev channel release this week .
Our test team did a great job in qualifying two Stable updates and a Beta update this week , and we just did n't have the bandwidth to push a Dev channel release .
We 'll get an update out early next week .
Stay tuned for some exciting new features we hope to land in the Dev channel . "
Which prompted a ZDNet blogger to write :
" It sounds like there is n't going to be a dev channel release of Chrome this week - simply because they 've already updated the stable , and beta channels this week , and simply can't do any more because they ran out of bandwidth .
...
You would n't think bandwidth at Google would be an issue , but it sounds like it can be . "
An industry analyst sent me the ZDNet link yesterday , noting : " I thought this was pretty funny -- Google running out of bandwidth . "
By which time the Google - sucked - up - all - its - bandwidth report already had been picked up by this blogger and this one and this one ... and this one that appears to be informing a presumably thunderstruck Chinese audience ... and , I believe , this one , although I do n't speak the language .
One can only imagine the fallout were such a Google bandwidth crisis actually true : Service providers would be rushing out press releases touting the depletion as proof positive of the need for bandwidth caps .
A congressman might smell a headline opportunity .
Heck , Wall Street might wonder if the recession has hamstrung Google 's R&D. ... Bailout ?
But , alas , the facts once again get in the way of a great story :
Google 's Larsen updated the blog post yesterday :
[ Edit , 11 May 2009 : Change ' bandwidth ' to ' test capacity ' .
Sometimes the colloquial jargon we use at work translates imprecisely for a public audience . ]
Ah , test capacity ; colloquial " bandwidth , " not real bandwidth .
Well , it 's still kind of interesting to learn that even at Google -- $ 129 - billion - dollar market cap Google -- resources remain finite .
— John Kemp is a Reuters columnist .
The views expressed are his own —
The current contango structure in crude oil futures and most other commodity markets — with future prices significantly above the spot market — is providing a strong incentive to buy and store record quantities of raw materials , with most of the cost borne by retail investors in exchange - traded funds and institutional investors in long - only commodity indices .
This “ cash - and - carry ” strategy rewards market participants with access to storage or finance at the lowest cost .
It is providing huge profits for physical commodity merchants , investment banks , and the owners and operators of warehouses and tank farms during the downturn , and helps explain the record profitability from commodity operations reported recently by some of the largest banking and trading groups .
In the current market , the cash - and - carry strategy rewards well - connected “ insiders ” such as investment and commercial banks able to secure almost unlimited financing at zero-cost as a result of quantitative easing programmes .
DOING THE CONTANGO
In a contango market , the Futures Price = Spot Price +
Finance ( interest rate on the money borrowed to own the physical commodity ) +
Storage ( cost of hiring tanks , tankers or warehouses ) +
Insurance ( premiums for insuring the commodity against loss , sinking , damage , theft etc ) .
Click here for PDF .
More generally , the equation can be re-written to cover any market ( whether contango or backwardation , when the futures price is below spot ) so the Futures Price = Spot +
Finance + Storage + Insurance – Scarcity / Prompt / Convenience Premium .
The prompt premium is the additional price a consumer is prepared to have spare material on hand “ just in case ” rather than risk having to go out into the market and buy it at an uncertain price or even find it is unavailable .
When commodity inventories are low , the convenience / scarcity / prompt premium can become very large and dominates all the other terms in the equation , ensuring the futures price is below the spot , and the market is in backwardation .
But otherwise the term is small and the cost of finance and storage exceeds the convenience / prompt premium and the market is in contango .
In practice , we can ignore the insurance term because ( a ) it tends to be quite small and ( b ) does not change very much .
For this analysis , we will also ignore the prompt / convenience premium since markets are well supplied at present and expected to remain so for the foreseeable future , with high stocks of crude oil , aluminium and other commodities .
In this simplified world , Futures Price = Spot + Finance + Storage .
In some sense , the futures price is above spot because by buying forward the purchaser avoids the finance and storage cost .
Conversely , the spot price is at a discount because buying now and holding into the future incurs finance and storage charges .
So far , we have assumed the finance and storage costs are the same for all market players .
But in practice the cost of finance varies over time and among market participants .
On the storage side , the cost depends on whether you own tanks / vessels / warehouses ; whether you have leased them on a long - term deal ; and whether a special discount is available .
In principle , the Future Price = Spot +
Finance +
Storage relationship should hold for the marginal market participant doing the storage and reflects the marginal players financing and storage charges .
But for everyone else with lower financing and storage costs the actual cost of storage should be below the cost reflected by the contango .
For these players , it pays to buy physical commodities , put them in storage , and then hedge the long physical position with a short futures position , pay the smaller storage and finance charges on the physical and receive the larger yield from the contango .
REWARDS FOR INSIDERS
Market participants with access to cheap finance ( banks ) or cheap storage ( tank farm and warehouse owners , or those with long term deals ) can make money on the physical deals .
This is one reason many commodity firms run a physical trading house and a warehousing company in tandem together with a futures brokerage .
The point is to exploit synergies and run a balanced business that is somewhat insulated from the cycle .
The physical trading business directs metal to the warehousing company and tries to ensure they are full ( and therefore earning rental income from the metal ) .
Whether the company takes the income as rent ( accruing to the warehousing arm ) or as a cheap rent deal ( with extra contango income accruing to the physical trading desk ) is a matter for the tax accountants .
But it creates an attractive synergy .
When the economy is booming , warehouse stocks will be low , so earnings on the warehousing company are poor , but futures turnover is usually high in a bull market , so the futures brokerage and speculative book make money .
When the economy is in recession , futures turnover drops and commission earnings fall , but the warehouses will be full earning plentiful rental income .
Only a small number of metals trading companies are fully integrated ( comprising a customer - oriented broker , a physical trading business , and a warehouse ) .
But most others will have special arrangements with one or more warehousing companies .
There are similar systems in oil — with banks taking leases on tank farm space or floating vessels to play the same strategy .
BACKWARDATION RISK
So far we have assumed that the physical and financial parts of the store and hedge game mature at the same time ( ie the lease on the storage space and the futures positions mature on the same date ) .
In this trade , there are no risks .
But it may be possible to spice up the returns by accepting some risk by mismatching the two legs of the deal .
A close look at the shape of the futures curve reveals that the steepest contango is usually for the first day or month , with progressively smaller contangos thereafter .
Instead of taking a 3 - month lease on some storage space and putting on a short position 3 months forward to hedge it , some physical traders will take a 3 - month lease and put on a short position 1 month forward ( earning the biggest bit of the contango ) with the assumption they can roll the short forward by another month and then another when the correct time comes .
The risk here is the market flips into backwardation at some point before the 3 months is up .
In which case rolling short positions forward will incur a cost not generate revenue .
Either the backwardation has to be paid ( reducing total returns on the strategy ) or the metal / oil has to be delivered before the 3 months are fully up against the maturing short position , in which case the player is paying storage costs on empty tanks / warehouses .
Long - term storage plays popular with many banks and trading houses at the moment , where shorts are repeatedly rolled , are a bet that the market will not flip into backwardation , and no one will organise a squeeze , before the storage deal matures .
This seems a fairly safe bet in the current environment of cheap money and plentiful inventories .

“ The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus ” is a fantastical morality tale , set in the present day .
It tells the story of Dr Parnassus and his extraordinary ‘ Imaginarium ’ , a travelling show where members of the audience get an irresistible opportunity to choose between light and joy or darkness and gloom .
Blessed with the extraordinary gift of guiding the imaginations of others , Dr Parnassus is cursed with a dark secret .
Long ago he made a bet with the devil , Mr Nick , in which he won immortality .
Many centuries later , on meeting his one true love , Dr Parnassus made another deal with the devil , trading his immortality for youth , on condition that when his first - born reached its 16th birthday he or she would become the property of Mr Nick …

May 15 , 2009 -- More than 100,000 Americans probably have the flu -- and at least half of these cases are H1N1 swine flu , a CDC expert estimates .
The comment came from Daniel Jernigan , MD , PhD , deputy director of the CDC 's influenza division , during a news conference .
Jernigan noted that the 4,700 confirmed or probable cases of swine flu reported to CDC represent a gross underestimate .
When asked how many actual cases there were , Jernigan noted that 7 % to 10 % of the U.S. population -- up to 30 million people -- get the seasonal flu each year .
" So with the amount of activity we are seeing now , it is a little hard to know what that means in terms of making an estimate now of the total number of people with flu out in the community , " Jernigan said .
" But if I had to make an estimate , I would say ... probably upwards of maybe 100,000 . "
The CDC 's most recent data , for the week ending May 9 , shows that about half of Americans with confirmed flu had the H1N1 swine flu .
If Jernigan 's off - the - cuff estimate is correct , more than 50,000 people in the U.S. have the new flu .
At a time when flu season should be ending or over , the CDC 's flu season indicators are going up instead of down .
As of May 9 , 22 states had widespread or regional flu .
Meanwhile , Arizona 's Maricopa County -- home to Phoenix -- reported that a woman in her late 40s died from complications of the H1N1 swine flu .
She is the nation 's fourth H1N1 swine flu fatality .
The woman had an underlying lung disease , according to the Maricopa County public health department .
Despite the death , the CDC 's marker for flu severity -- deaths from pneumonia or flu -- did not increase beyond normal levels for this time of year .
This so - called " epidemic threshold " is 7.4 % of all deaths ; for the week ending May 9 , flu / pneumonia deaths were 7.2 % of all deaths .
One of the most alarming signs of a flu pandemic is a lot of severe illness in people who do n't usually suffer severe flu cases -- older children and young adults .
Most of the 173 people hospitalized in the U.S. with H1N1 swine flu have been between 5 - 24 years old .
" At this point , we 're not seeing the seriousness of illness in the United States that was initially reported in Mexico , but this certainly does not mean that the outbreak is over , " Jernigan said .
" The H1N1 virus is not going away .
We know that the outbreak is not localized but is spreading and appears to be expanding throughout the United States .
While the real long - term interest rate will not rise immediately , the committee concluded , “ such a fiscal path could force real rates notably higher at some point in the future . ”

In some ways , ballooning deficits should not matter .
Deficits are a useful way for governments to use public spending to stimulate the economy when private demand is weak .
This works as long as a country closes its deficit and pays back its borrowings after its economy starts to recover .
The trouble is that government borrowing risks crowding out private investment , driving up interest rates and potentially slowing a recovery still trying to take hold .
That is why the Federal Reserve announced an extraordinary policy this year to buy back existing long - term debt  $ 300 billion over six months  to drive down yields .
The strategy worked for a while , but now the impact of that decision appears to be wearing off as long - term interest rates tick up again .
Then there is the concern that the interest the government must pay on its debt obligations may become unsustainable or weigh on future generations .
The Congressional Budget Office expects interest payments to more than quadruple in the next decade as Washington borrows and spends , to $ 806 billion by 2019 from $ 172 billion next year .
“ You ’re just paying more and more interest and having to borrow more and more money to pay the interest , ” said Charles S. Konigsberg , chief budget counsel for the Concord Coalition , which advocates lower deficits .
“ It diverts a tremendous amount of resources , of taxpayer dollars . ”
Of course , no one is suggesting the United States will have problems paying the interest on its debt .
On Wednesday , even as it announced its huge financing needs for the latest quarter , the Treasury said financial markets could accommodate the flood of new bonds .
“ We feel confident that we can address these large borrowing needs , ” said Karthik Ramanathan , the Treasury ’s acting assistant secretary for financial markets .
One worry , however , is that there are fewer eager lenders to buy all that American debt .
Most of the world is in recession , and other nations have rising borrowing needs as well .
As other nations ’ surpluses turn to deficits , America will face competition in global financial markets for its borrowing needs .
For the moment , the United States is actually benefiting from a flight to quality into Treasuries brought on by the global financial crisis , which helped reduce rates to record lows this winter .
But the influx will not continue forever .
This morning I informed my colleagues that I had only one thing on my to - do list .
Two of them chuckled , a few of them rolled their eyes , but every one of them assumed I would spend most of my day slacking off .
They changed their minds , however , when our boss sent out a mass email this afternoon praising me for resolving a principal issue that my colleagues had been sidestepping all week long .
In my boss ’s eyes , the one thing on my to - do list was more important than the fifty other things my colleagues had accomplished during the same time frame .
A Commitment to One Thing a Day
Some people spend 90 % of their time organizing their time .
Some tackle to - do lists peppered with insignificance that stretch a mile long .
And still , there are others who refuse to do anything at all .
As for me , I am committed to doing one thing a day , and that has made all the difference .
The One Thing To -Do List
What one thing will you do today ?
Get out a blank sheet of paper and a pen .
Write “ I will do one thing today ! ” in big letters across the page .
Then list your one thing at the bottom .
It should look something like this :
Make your own “ I Will Do One Thing Today ” to - do list every morning and get it done before you get sidetracked with unimportant stuff .
Economist Jeffrey Miron says legalization of drugs makes more sense than prohibition .
By Jeffrey A. Miron
Special to CNN
Editor 's note : Jeffrey A. Miron is senior lecturer in economics at Harvard University .
The CNN story that provided the hook for my debate with former DEA official Robert Guttman might appear at first glance to make a convincing case against legalizing drugs like heroin or cocaine ; the story recounts the tragic death of a teenager from heroin use .
Read the story
In fact , the story illustrates perfectly why legalization makes more sense than prohibition , even for hard drugs .
The incident recounted in the story occurred under current policy : prohibition did not prevent this teenager from using heroin .
As the story emphasized , moreover , heroin prices have fallen dramatically over the past several decades to the point where heroin is available in a relatively pure form at prices most teenagers can afford .
This shows that government anti-drug policies have been a dismal failure , since the express purpose of those policies is to raise drug prices and reduce use .
Federal and state government have spent hundreds of billions of dollars attempting to enforce prohibition , yet availability and purity are higher than ever while price is at record lows .
Thus prohibition has failed to accomplish its stated goals , and it generates enormous negative side effects .
Counterpoint – Drug legalization : " A great idea whose time has not come ! "
One side effect is violence and corruption , as recent events in Mexico illustrate dramatically .
In underground markets , participants resolve disputes with guns because they cannot use lawyers or advertising .
A second side effect is accidental poisonings and overdoses , since quality control in underground markets is difficult .
In a legal market , potentially dangerous substances come with purity clearly indicated .
This does not prevent all overdoses , since some users make poor decisions about how much to consume , but it allows responsible user to avoid excessive consumption .
The prohibitionist view of human nature is that if a potentially dangerous substance like heroin were legal , huge numbers of people would use it a way that harmed themselves and others .
No evidence validates this view .
Yes , some people would misuse drugs if they were legal , but most of those people are misusing drugs now .
Overall , most people try to avoid stupid or irresponsible risks , whether the substance is legal or prohibited .
The difference is therefore the ancillary consequences of the legal regime imposed , and on that criterion prohibition is a disaster .
Vote !
Should drugs be legal in the U.S. ?
The Computer History Museum of Mountain View , California has put on display a pair documents from Apple 's early years , outlining the company 's strategic planning , optimism , and doubts as it embarked on a mission to forever change the world with its line of Macintosh computers .
The first is a Preliminary Confidential Offering Memorandum from 1977 , donated by one of Appleâs initial investors , Mike Markkula , while the second is a Macintosh Business Plan from 1981 , donated by Dan Kottke , the company 's first employee .
The Preliminary Confidential Offering Memorandum outlines the offering of up to 150,000 shares of common stock , supported by an evaluation of the market and competitors in relation to Appleâs products and strategy .
This was the first offering of shares for the fledgling company following its founding by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak .
Among the risk factors listed at the start of the document are an acknowledgement of the companyâs newness without an established history on which forecasts could be based , as well as a management team that was " young and relatively inexperienced in the high volume consumer electronics business . "
The memo goes on to describe the primary target market â the Personal Computer Market .
With a home computer , the average consumer could reap such benefits as " personal pleasure and enjoyment , " " elimination of wasted paper , energy and storage space , " and an " improved standard of living . "
However , developing this market was seen as a significant challenge , requiring at least two hours of discussion to " convince ' Joe Average ' that he needs a computer . "
Apple planned to rely on mass media outlets to reach out to consumers to provide this education .
The documents outline current and planned products in detail , showing the existing Apple II computer with a manufacturing cost between $ 300 and $ 400 , with key features such as dual - mode color graphics and fan - less cooling , putting it an estimated 12 months ahead of competing products .
The Apple IIA , with manufacturing costs between $ 225 and $ 300 , would yield a gross profit of up to $ 700 with a planned retail price of $ 995 .
Several peripheral releases planned through 1978 are also itemized , including items like a Telephone Interface Board and a Voice Recognition System .
In targeting the Personal Computer Market , Apple expected its primary competition to come from Commodore Business Machines and Tandy Corporation , but expressed optimism in relation to Apple products with more expandability and better - trained service staff .
In relation to the Tandy TRS 80 machine , the competitor analysis goes so far as to state that the Apple IIA will " definitely outsell the TRS 80 ' hands down ' regardless of the large number of potential retail locations in the Radio Shack chain . "
Texas Instruments and Atari are mentioned as upcoming competitors with the ability to obtain substantial shares of the market .
The memo also reveals philosophies that appear to exist at Apple to this day .
Described in the Appendix , the Apple Software Bank â a repository of software created both by users and Apple â was created to " increase the usefulness and enjoyment of the Apple II system " and " with the user in mind . "
In describing the distribution strategy , the desire to " insure that each customer establishes a positive on - going relationship with the local Apple dealer " is expressed as a key approach .
The 1981 Business Plan document provides detailed information on Appleâs product line at the time , lining up each in a price Band among competitor products and touting that " the advantage of a product line is that each individual product does not have to do everything . "
Each product is also targeted at specific market segments , such as managers , secretaries , and home businesses , and related software for each is also considered .
New products , peripherals , and software , including the 300 baud Mac Phone and Mac Writer application , are mapped out through the second quarter of 1983 , and projected total headcount in the Macintosh Organization at the end of 1981 is 63 employees , up from 16 at the time the business plan was written .
A list of open issues at the end of the document , however , reveals significant concerns , showing that the Macintosh manufacturer had not yet been selected and a question on the reasonableness of the planned schedule .
The plan closes with an almost - whimsical image of a man seated at a table with an apple on the plate before him and the pronouncement " We will announce no Apple before its time " — a a parody off an Orson Welles commercial from the early 80âs .
A couple of days ago InfoQ posted an article about the fact that the release notes for G1 in the latest Java update , mandated that it was to be used in production only by organizations with a Sun support contract .
Following the debate and the reactions that where raised in the community , Sun has explicitly updated the release notes and has removed the controversial clause .
Danny Coward from
Sun quotes the InfoQ article and suggests that it was just a misunderstanding :
Comparing the two versions of the release notes , it seems that Sun has changed the sentences :
Although G1 is available for use in this release , note that production use of G1 is only permitted where a Java support contract has been purchased .
G1 is supported thru Sun's Java Platform Standard Edition for Business program .
With :
G1 is available as early access in this release , please try it and give us feedback .
Usage in production settings without a Java SE for Business support contract is not recommended .
What do you think , could this just have been a huge misunderstanding ?
Why did so many try to connect it to the recent news about the aquitision by Oracle ?
In a letter to voters , Congressman Robert Wexler ( D - FL ) has announced his introduction of House Resolution 383 to establish “ a bi-partisan Select Committee tasked with making comprehensive recommendations on our national security policy – including those covering laws on torture , FISA law violations , wiretapping , civil liberties protections , among others .
This committee would have all of the power of a standing committee , including subpoena power . ”
Co-sponsors are Barbara Lee ( D - CA ) and John Conyers ( D - MI ) .
Conyers is chairman of the House Judiciary Committee .
Wexler ’s statement continued by stating that , “ The committee will investigate many of the outrageous policies of the Bush Administration to unearth and expose what happened during the past eight years … .
We must take a hard look at what went wrong in the last eight years .
We must continue to peel back the veil of secrecy that the previous Administration used as cover to undermine our system of checks and balances , and establish a clear line between what is necessary for our security and what is unlawful government intrusion and a violation of our civil liberties . ”
Wexler is not the only member of Congress to announce his attention to call out the Bush administration on its abuses .
Senator Patrick Leahy wants to set up a “ Truth Commission , ” whose mission , as described in Time , would be “ to investigate the politicization of prosecution in the Justice Department under former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales ; the wiretapping of U.S. Citizens ; the flawed intelligence used to justify the invasion of Iraq ; and the use of torture at Guantanamo and so - called black sites abroad .
Leahy ’s commission is to be modeled after one that investigated the apartheid regime in South Africa . ”
The trouble is that congressional investigating committees rarely amount to anything .
An example was the 1976 House Select Committee on Assassinations , set up to investigate the killings of President John F. Kennedy and Dr. Martin Luther King , Jr. The committee met largely in secret , withheld much of its evidence from the public , and , while it said both assassinations likely involved conspiracies , stated no government agencies were parties to them .
The latter point has been disputed by independent researchers both before and since .
Another example was the National Commission on Terrorist Attacks on the United States , a.k.a , the 9/11 Commission .
While the commission concluded that failures of the CIA and FBI allowed the attacks to occur , it failed to look at any possibility of complicity by those agencies or the Bush administration .
Members of the commission later said government officials lied to them and impeded the investigation .
It ’s possible , of course , that any committees set up to investigate Bush , Cheney , at.al. , will have better luck , but will they examine the questions that really matter ?
Neither Wexler nor Leahy mention reopening the 9/11 case .
And neither mentions the event that may be just as momentous — this is the “ financial 9/11 ” ; i.e. , the 2008 collapse of the U.S. financial system .
I ’d like to find out , for instance , how the 9/11 terrorist attacks were connected with the extraordinary movement of massive amounts of funds within and outside the Federal Reserve and U.S. banking system that led to a huge growth in the M3 monetary supply before the Federal Reserve stopped reporting M3 data in 2006 .
Such a link has been suggested in some internet reports .
I ’d also like to know how and why Federal Reserve Chairman Alan Greenspan colluded with the Bush White House to suddenly start pumping massive amounts of credit into the housing bubble from 2001 - 2005 and what instructions went out to Comptroller of the Currency , the Securities and Exchange Commission , and other federal regulators to prevent the abuses in the subprime mortgage market from being investigated .
Then I ’d like to know why the Bush Administration , including Secretary of the Treasury Henry Paulson , claimed no one foresaw the crash of the financial system in October 2008 , why the demand was suddenly made to Congress for over $ 700 billion in bank bailouts , and what the role of Paulson and the host of other former Goldman - Sachs executives working for the Bush administration had in setting the stage for the crash and profiting from it .
And why is current Secretary of the Treasury Timothy Geithner doing virtually the same as Paulson did in throwing money at the banks while the economy sinks deeper in recession ?
Of course neither Wexler nor Leahy intends to examine any of these issues .
Which is why their calls for investigations make good political theater , may put a few minor players on the hot seat , but , in the big picture , will be a complete waste of time .
A better course would be a Special Prosecutor .
But the Obama administration has given no indication of doing this either .
I know this story is a month old , but I wanted to hit it for a second .
I 'm always amazed by conservatives ' behavior when it comes to their feelings about the poor in this country .
Here 's K - Lo from the NRO :
Robert Rector has been pointing out for longer than I can remember that America has the wealthiest poor people in the world .
And here seems to be a photo illustrating that : Michelle Obama was at a homeless shelter .
While distributing lunch , one of the men she was serving lunch to took a picture of her on his cell phone .
I do n't envy this man 's situation , whatever it is , and do n't mean to make light of it .
But we are a blessed people when our poor have cell phones .
She has no idea in what context this photo was taken or why this person has a cell phone , but she is just amazed that poor people are running around , eating our food , driving Cadillacs and making calls on cell phones .
Would n't you like to see her penniless and on her own for 180 days to see what would happen ?
Andrew Malcolm is an Internet friend of mine , but I see he has the same opinion .
Searching for something ( anything ) to bitch about when it comes to the Obama's , Andrew Malcolm seizes on Michelle Obama serving food at a homeless shelter in order to point out that some filthy homeless person is taking a picture of the First Lady with a cellphone .
Blissfully unaware of cheap disposable cellphones that can be purchased anywhere , Malcolm wonders where the disgusting parasitic poor have their phone bills delivered .
Later Malcolm will review older pictures from the last Republican Depression That FDR Was Responsible For and wonder why all the poor guys begging for bread were wearing such spiffy suits and nice hats .
Looking at how they relate to the poor in this country I 'm coming to understand that it's not a political position that they hold , but more of a psychological disorder / Since Jung and Freud are not around , I 'll give it a diagnosis from the DSM IV :
I think it can be traced to their early childhood experiences .
K- Lo is playing in her sandbox with a new Barbie Doll and another kid wants to touch it and hold it for a minute , but she clutches it tightly to her body and yells : " Mine ! "
It 's a reflexive action triggered from their past , and in K - Lo 's experience she 's afraid that the poor kid with no shoes will steal her little dollie even though she has 127 brand new ones stacked in her closet -- unopened .
It continues on well through Erikson 's eight stages of Psychosocial development and results in writings , rantings and beliefs by the wingnut punditry class that are demonstrated by their incessant screams of " Socialism " on my TV .
It ’s really no mystery how nonreligious people are moral too .
Sill , religious people just can’t help but make a big mystery out of this obvious fact .
Even if the religious admit that atheists can know what morality is , they stay bewildered by atheists ’ ability to willingly follow morality .
We hear the faithful endlessly worry over moral atheists .
" How do they obey morality , when they have no motivation to be so good ? "
Is it like watching a disaster movie for them ?
The faithful seem perched on the edges of their seats , anticipating a catastrophic climax when a billion people who do n’t believe in any supernatural God suddenly erupt into anarchy and chaos .
Sorry to disappoint all you religious people — there is no apocalypse coming .
The world is getting along just fine with a sixth of the world ’s population living without your God .
No disaster is coming , and it ’s no mystery why not .
Unbelievers do n’t need God to stay moral .
It ’s all about motivation .
Evidently the nonreligious are just as capable of behaving morally .
Nonbelievers behave about as morally as anyone else .
For example , the percentage of criminals who are atheists is just about the same as the percentage of atheists in the general population .
Of course , the faithful are alarmed by nonbelievers rejecting their God and his / her / its commands .
From the perspective of the faithful , the basic motivation to be moral comes from fearing / loving / appeasing their God — so nonbelievers appear to be morally unmotivated .
The faithful may have convinced themselves they need God to be morally motivated , but this ( sad ) fact about them does not show that God must exist .
The religious argue that no unbeliever could be motivated to want to be moral .
How could a God be required for motivation ?
Well , the argument goes something like this :
1. If God does not exist , then there is no guarantee that moral goodness will ultimately prevail .
2 . If there is no guarantee that moral goodness will ultimately prevail , then there is no guarantee that moral conduct is meaningful .
3 . If there is no guarantee that moral conduct is meaningful , then people cannot be reasonably motivated to behave morally .
4 . People should be reasonably motivated to behave morally .
Therefore ,
C. God exists .
The faithful worry that a moral action is meaningless unless its positive value is eternally guaranteed .
This worry is analogous to the worry that the eventual destruction of something we create makes our creation ultimately meaningless and valueless .
This is the existential worry of nihilism : everything might really be pointless .
What will our lives and our deeds really mean , one million years from now , or when the universe ends ?
Nonbelievers are not immune from this worry .
Many naturalists , for example , do believe that human life and all human creations are ultimately meaningless and valueless when imaginatively viewed from any sufficiently remote perspective .
A few philosophies and religions instruct us to adopt this nihilistic stance towards our lives , our deeds , and our creations : we should stoically view them as having little or no value , so that we are not attached to them and we suffer nothing when they are gone .
Even if naturalism required nihilism however , nihilism does not make moral conduct unreasonable and need not deprive us of the motivation to be moral .
First of all , nihilism cannot imply that a person would only do immoral things .
The religious person worries , Without God , why should I bother being moral ?
Of course , if nihilism were correct and all of my deeds are ultimately meaningless , then my bad deeds are meaningless too –
Why should I bother being immoral either ?
Nihilism cannot imply anything about what a person should or would do .
Regardless of nihilism , there are naturalistic explanations for the reasonableness of preferring moral conduct over immoral conduct .
The nonbeliever can hold that ( 1 ) possessing moral knowledge alone provides a reasonable motivation to be moral ; ( 2 ) moral conduct can be intrinsically satisfying for one ’s self and hence is reasonable ; ( 3 ) moral conduct towards another person is valuable to that person and hence reasonably creates value ; ( 4 ) moral conduct can be a practical means of maintaining beneficial social relations and hence is reasonable ; ( 5 ) moral conduct can be useful for survival and hence would be reasonable .
Any one of these options suffices to supply a naturalistic account of reasonable moral motivations .
The naturalist can assemble several of the more plausible options in order to organize a robust alternative to supernaturalism ’s view of morality .
The nonbeliever can finally point out that moral motivation , moral courage , and moral character hardly depend on an assurance that “ all will work out for the best in the end . ”
Why should religious faith in ultimate victory deliver moral superiority ?
After all , who deserves higher approval – the person who does the right thing when the best outcome is already guaranteed , or the person who does the right thing even when the outcome appears hopeless ?
Righteousness even in the face of despair marks the genuinely moral person .
This motivated person is not unreasonable for such moral convictions .
Nonbelievers may not know how it all will turn out , but they can reasonably want morality to prevail right here and now .
Helping the needy , defending human rights , preventing unnecessary cruelty , and promoting peace , for example , are always morally worthy , regardless of what may happen tomorrow .
Do n’t worry , fathful — you can count on steady morality from nonbelievers .
If you must worry over some looming moral apocalypse , you might look over at a neighboring religion .
Who knows what their God will tell them to do next ?!

Simona Halep Likely To Have Breast Reduction
Updates
June 3/09 – * Alena Schurkova : “ Simona Halep You Can Be A Champion With Big Boobs ”
May 28/09 – * Simona Halep Sets Date To Have Breast Reduction *
Total Pro Sports –
It is a sad day in woman ’s tennis .
Roughly one month after TPS brought you the rising star of the WTA , Simona Halep , we now regret to inform you that she is strongly considering breast reduction .
I guess this answers most people question , “ how does she play with those things ? ”
Apparently , she can’t !
Earlier this month in an interview with the Romanian site ProSport , Simona Halep stated her wishes to have breast reduction surgery .
Upon explaining her reasoning behind such a decision , she pointed to the added weight and difficulty in carrying her jugs over to every ball that gets hit her way .
Here is a translation of her interview :
“ I do not believe that physical appearance has an effect on performance , so I help with anything in the sport .
My mind bust when I go on the field and even if I were sporting , I would have felt very good .
( My Breasts ) inconvenience me , it ’s very hard with them .
It ’s a weight in addition to confound me speed response .
I can not go on very well .
Shoot me down .
Nothing in life is not like me even though sport was not all I was doing surgery ” , revealed Halep .
“ Surgical intervention should take place last year , but probably will use it in autumn , because the postponement might cause problems in the column . ”
[ ProSport.ro ]
It would be interesting to see if this will help her opponents out as well , now that they can concentrate on one moving tennis ball , without the additional bouncing soccer balls behind it .
What we do know is that simona halep should be much faster on the court , and will give herself more room to swing with the reduction , but lets hope this does n’t take away from her fame .
Should she have a long and successful tennis career , the move will be well worth it , but should she flame out , then she will likely wish she still had those two giant airbags to save her .
Surgery is expected to take place some time next year .
It is unclear what size she plans on going down too .
We here at TPS will keep you posted on this breaking news .

Approximately 8 - 12 million companion animals enter animal shelters nationwide every year and approximately 5 - 9 million are euthanized ( 60 % of dogs and 70 % of cats ) .
You might help to save the life of an animal today !
TV Roundup : “ Terminator : TSCC ” canceled , “ Scrubs ” and “ Chuck ” news , and much more
– Fox released it ’s fall schedule .
“ Dollhouse ” was renewed and “ Terminator : The Sarah Connor Chronicles ” was n’t .
President Kevin Reilly said it was n’t an either / or situation , but that the bet on “ Dollhouse ” was a bet on its producer Joss Whedon .
I want to hear from people who watched both shows — was “ Dollhouse ” better ?
Because “ Terminator : TSCC ” was damn good down the stretch .
( On a side note , how long do you think it will take Summer Glau to find another role ?
Hint : Not long . )
– Fox prez Kevin Reilly is apparently a big fan of Tyler Labine ( who plays Sock on “ Reaper ” ) .
Labine is set to star in the comedy “ Sons of Tuscon , ” which debuts in January .
Clearly , this is not good news for “ Reaper ” fans .
– Ponderously , ABC renewed “ Scrubs , ” which only plans to have Zach Braff for six episodes .
What ’s the point ?
– NBC renewed “ Chuck ” for 13 episodes , but it came at a price .
There were significant budget concessions , so fans might notice that parts of the supporting cast may disappear at times .
I stopped watching early in the season because it was getting kind of silly ( and that whole Chuck / Sarah dance was getting tiresome ) — did it get significantly better down the stretch ?
– According to creator Noah Hawley ’s Twitter page , “ The Unusuals ” wo n’t be back for another season .
However , CBS did renew “ Cold Case ” for another season .
– Fox has renewed “ Bones ” for not one , but two years , according to Variety .
– CBS picked up a Chris O’Donnell - led spinoff of “ NCIS ” which is going to “ focus on undercover ops instead of forensics . ”
Wait , was n’t that the premise of “ The Unit ” ?
– If no one watches “ Samantha Who ? ” and it gets canceled , does it make a sound ?
Juuuuust kidding .
( Not about it being canceled . )
– “ The Office ” creators ( and I ’m talking about the original UK version ) , Ricky Gervais and Stephen Merchant , inked a deal with HBO to produce an animated comedy based on their podcast about their unusual friend , Karl Pilkington , whom they seem to think is the most fascinating man in the world .
( And coming from those two , that ’s high praise . )
The US government is to drop espionage charges against two officials of America 's most powerful pro-Israel lobby group accused of spying for the Jewish state because court rulings had made the case unwinnable and the trial would disclose classified information .
The two accused , Steven Rosen and Keith Weissman , worked for the American Israel Public Affairs Committee ( Aipac ) , which drives fundraising for some US members of Congress .
They were accused of providing defence secrets to the chief political officer at the Israeli embassy in Washington , Naor Gilon , about US policy toward Iran and al - Qaida in league with a former Pentagon analyst who has since been jailed for 12 years .
Dana Boente , who was prosecuting the case in Virginia , said that the case was dropped because pre-trial court rulings had complicated the government 's case by requiring a higher level of proof of intent to spy .
The court said the prosecution would have to prove not only that the accused pair had passed classified information but that they intended to harm the US in doing so .
Rosen and Weissman have argued they were merely using the back - channel contacts with government officials , lobbyists and diplomats that are common in Washington .
The defence intended to call the former US secretary of state , Condoleezza Rice , and other officials to establish that the government regularly uses Aipac to discreetly send information to Israel .
A former Pentagon analyst , Lawrence Franklin , has already pleaded guilty to disclosing classified information to Rosen and Weissman .
The dropping of the charges will come as a relief to Aipac because the case threatened to overshadow its annual conference this weekend at which it parades support from American politicians .
It was also an embarrassment which laid the lobby group open to charges of putting Israel 's interests above those of the US .
The case has been further complicated by a scandal revealed last month by a political publication , Congressional Quarterly , around a member of Congress , Jane Harman , who was secretly taped telling an Israeli agent that she would pressure the justice department to reduce spying charges against the two former Aipac officials .
In return , the Israeli agent offered to get a wealthy donor who helps funds election campaigns for Nancy Pelosi , the then - minority leader in the House of Representatives , to pressure Pelosi to appoint Harman to a senior position on the congressional intelligence committee .
Aware of the sensitivity of the position she has put herself in , Harman finished the discussion with the Israeli spy by saying : " This conversation does n't exist . "
Congressional Quarterly obtained a transcript of the tape recorded by the National Security Agency .
An FBI probe of Harman was dropped after the intervention of President Bush 's attorney general , Alberto Gonzales .
Aipac has long wielded considerable influence over US policy in the Middle East though a mix of appeals to American sympathy for Israel and a hard - ball approach against members of congress who question the unyielding policies of Israeli governments .
The incumbent President said his rival had won a " narrow victory "
Mongolia 's opposition party candidate has won the presidential election .
The leader of the Democratic Party and two - time former prime minister , Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj , had campaigned on an anti-corruption ticket .
Incumbent President Nambaryn Enkhbayar - of the former Communist party - admitted a " narrow " defeat .
Official results are yet to be released .
The election campaign was dominated by the issue of distributing the country 's vast mineral wealth .
President Nambaryn Enkhbayar admitted defeat in Sunday 's poll , saying he respected the result , according to Chinese state media .
He said that , according to parties ' counting of the votes , Tsakhiagiin Elbegdorj - his only rival in the election - had won a narrow victory .
Mongolian media are also reporting that Mr Elbegdorj has won .
Widespread poverty
Speaking earlier , the Democratic Party chairman told supporters that Mongolia was " meeting a new morning , with a new president " .
The BBC's Quentin Sommerville in Beijing says there were fears that a close result could lead to civil unrest .
Allegations of vote rigging during last year 's parliamentary poll sparked protests in which five people died and hundreds were hurt .
Reports from the capital Ulan Bator say that the streets are calm but police and troops are on stand - by in case of trouble .
In 1990 , Mongolia abandoned its 70 - year - old Soviet - style one - party state and embraced political and economic reforms .
Democracy and privatisation were enshrined in a new constitution , but the collapse of the economy after the withdrawal of Soviet support triggered widespread poverty and unemployment in the sparsely - populated , landlocked country .

HIV is not in recession !
TB is not in recession !
May 6 , 2009 --
On the occasion of the Conference of African Ministers of Health in Addis Ababa , Ethiopia , a coalition of health advocates from sub-Saharan Africa warn that the lives of millions of people in sub-Saharan Africa are in jeopardy because of the lack of political will and investment to realise the right of access to life - saving treatment .
Only one third of HIV - positive people in need of antiretroviral therapy ( ART ) to survive have access to treatment in the African region .
The coalition fears that national and donor governments are betraying their health commitments , particularly promises to support the universal roll - out of ART by 2010 .
" The broken promises and skewed priorities of governments and donors have reduced the right to health and access to treatment to unattainable rhetoric .
In the last few months , we have seen trillions of dollars spent on financial ‘ bailouts ’ to stimulate economic recovery ” , said Nonkosi Kumalo of the Treatment Action Campaign .
" A tiny portion of this sum could have bought quality , sustainable healthcare for millions of people . "
Dr Bactrin Killingo of the HIV Collaborative Fund warned that “ if the current cost constraints faced by HIV treatment programs are not addressed , while the demand for expensive second - line treatment increases , we will find ourselves in a situation similar to the ’90s , where millions of lives were lost unnecessarily because people could not afford the treatment they needed to stay alive ” .
Africa : 68 % of AIDS sufferers , 2 % of health workers
The region of sub -Saharan Africa bears the greatest burden of disease , and has 68 % of the world ’s HIV - positive people but only 1 % of the global expenditure on health , and 2 % of the global health workforce .
A recent African Union report states that sub-Saharan Africa faces “ a grim scenario with respect to the health of its people ” , estimating that only 7 % of total government expenditure in the region goes to health despite the 2001 Abuja Declaration commitment to commit 15 % of government expenditure to health .
These shortcomings will be highlighted at the CAMH in Addis Ababa , where the Africa Public Health Alliance is submitting a petition to African heads of state and ministers of health and finance to close the US $ 10.7 billion funding gap for regional implementation of the Global Plan to Stop TB .
Most governments in the region cover less than half of their national health budgets with national resources , while the rest comes from out - of - pocket spending or international funders – most notably , for HIV and TB , the Global Fund .
The financial support of the Global Fund and other donor agencies has had a remarkable impact on scale - up of services in sub-Saharan Africa .
The Global Fund reports that it has saved an estimated 2.5 million lives worldwide and has disbursed 57 % of international donor aid raised for TB , 50 % of malaria , and 23 % of funds for HIV / AIDS .
However , the increasingly steep trajectory of demand for Global fund grants , coupled with dwindling donor input and the global economic crisis , have resulted in the Global Fund announcing that it is at least $ 4 billion short of the money that it will need to continue funding essential HIV , TB and malaria services in 2010 .
In 2005 , the leaders of G8 countries , the richest nations in the world , committed to the goal of universal access to ART by 2010 – a goal that governments across the world pledged to support .
Many of these same countries are now becoming antagonistic towards disease - specific funding , calling instead for “ horizontal ” approaches to health financing such as the International Health Partnership , without committing to the massive increases in funding that would be necessary to finance health across the board .
Containing disease should be top priority
The coalition rejects pitting HIV against other diseases .
Contrary to what some influential health economists and ``development experts '' are claiming , there is ample evidence that ARV roll - out has strengthened health systems , and the work done by AIDS service organisations has revolutionised healthcare in the developing world .
African heads of state in 2001 stated that , “ We are fully convinced that containing and reversing the HIV / AIDS epidemic , tuberculosis and other infectious diseases should constitute our top priority for the first quarter of the 21st century ” .
This conviction is not reflected in the resources that African governments have commited to health , nor in the lethargic progress towards scaling up TB and HIV programs in the region .
The global economic crisis threatens to worsen this situation , with a recent World Bank report estimating that the negative impact of this crisis on HIV programs will affect 70 % of people on ART in Africa within the next 12 months .
Said Paula Akugizibwe of the AIDS and Rights Alliance for Southern Africa ( ARASA ) : “ We need to ensure that African lives do not become a silent casualty of the global financial downturn .
Our lives are not cheap or expendable .
We expect health to be prioritised over weapons , sports and lavish politics . ”
ARASA hosted a meeting on financing for Eastern and Southern African HIV / TB activists last week , out of which this coalition was formed to advocate around several key messages :
“ We believe that health is our right .
We are committed to sustained , universal access to ART .
We are committed to prevention and treatment for TB , malaria and other illnesses that devastate our communities .
We demand that African governments and donors honour their commitments to funding for health , and close the resource gaps as needed to secure universal access to HIV and TB treatment .
Through a sustained and coordinated regional campaign , we will fight for our non-negotiable right to health until it is realised . ”
What kind of master spy leaks Valve 's Meet the Spy video onto the internet in the middle of the night ?
The same kind that has an entire file dedicated to the Scout 's mom .

This is exactly what happens when you 're all sneaky .
Someone goes and sneaks right back , uploading your introduction video all over the internet .
Perhaps this is payback for the Spy taking over the Team Fortress 2 Sniper update halfway though ?
Either way , the video does feature the best line appearing in anything , ever .

Do n't continue reading until you 've watched the video .
That 's all the warning I 'm going to give .
" So listen up boy , or pornography starring your mother will be the second worst thing that happens to you today . "
Now of course whether or not this is Valve 's official video remains to be seen , but it definitely is *a*
Meet the Spy video , so we can leave the rumor tag off of this one .
Some reports have the video popping up on Valve 's official YouTube page , only to be quickly taken down .
I 've popped off an email to them , but seeing as it is the weekend I 'm doubting we 'll get a response anytime soon .
If it is official , I 'd say this is definitely the best of the bunch so far .
The Medic and the Pyro have their work cut out for them , and do n't think simply revealing the firestarter is a woman is going to cut the mustard .

CANNES , France ( CNN ) --
A budding British director is enjoying success on a shoestring at Cannes with " Colin , " a new zombie feature that cost a scarcely believable $ 70 to make .
" Colin " director Marc Price who spent 18 months making the film , working nights at a private car hire firm .

Japanese distributors are currently in negotiations for the rights to the film and buzz around the no-budget zombie chiller has attracted interest from some major American distributors -- all of which is a very nice surprise for the team behind " Colin . "
" We were almost fainting at the list of people who were coming [ to the final market screening of the film ] , " said Helen Grace of Left Films who is helping the film 's director Marc Price publicize the film in Cannes .
" Representatives from major American distributors -- some of the Hollywood studios . "
" When we say it 's a low budget film , people presume a couple of hundred thousand [ dollars ] .
People can't figure out how it 's possible .
What Marc 's achieved has left people astonished . "
It was by advertising for volunteer zombies on social networking site Facebook , borrowing make - up from Hollywood blockbusters and teaching himself how to produce special effects that thrifty director Price was able to make the film for less than the price of a zombie DVD box set .
" The approach was to say to people , ' OK guys , we do n't have any money , so bring your own equipment , ' " the the 30 year - old director told CNN .
With help from a makeshift band of friends and volunteers , Price shot and edited the feature -- which ingeniously spins the zombie genre on its head by telling the story entirely from the zombie 's perspective -- over a period of 18 months while working nights part - time as a booker for a taxi company .
Online social networking was an invaluable tool in both generating buzz and cheaply sourcing the undead : " We went on Facebook and MySpace and said ' Who wants to be a zombie ? ' " Price told CNN .
" We managed to get 50 brilliantly made up zombies and stuff them into a living room . "
In keeping with Price 's beg and borrow approach , most of the zombie make - up in the make - up artists ' cases was inherited from other movies .
" One of our make - up people came off ' X - Men 3 , ' so we were having the same latex that was put on Wolverine , " he told CNN .
Price says he came up with the idea to make a no - budget film because he realized that he and his friends would never be able to scrape together enough money to make even a low - budget film .
" A couple of friends were round a few years ago watching Romero 's ' Dawn of the Dead , ' recalls Price .
" And we were lamenting the fact that we could never make a zombie film -- we would n't be able to acquire a budget . "
" Then I just woke up before everyone else -- I was probably a bit hungover -- and I wondered if a zombie movie from a zombie 's perspective had been done before . "
The end result is " Colin , " a zombie film " with a heart , " Price says , shot using production values cribbed from endless re-watching of making - of featurettes and director 's commentaries from his personal DVD collection .
Zombie fan Web site zombiefriends.com called it " as original , compelling and thought provoking as [ George ] Romero 's ' Night of the Living Dead , ' " while horror magazine SCARS predicted it would " revolutionize zombie cinema . "
Price hopes that the film will generate enough interest to kick - start his career and allow him to make another film .
" Hopefully we 'll be able to generate some interest and maybe try to get some kind of a budget for our next film -- maybe a bigger budget , £ 100 , I do n't know . "

Price 's cost - effective filmmaking may make him the envy of film executives sweating over whether their latest projects will break even , but even " Colin " may suffer at the market : " In a strange way it 's kind of counter - productive . " admits Price .
" Anyone involved in sales will say , ' Oh , it cost [ $ 70 ] , well how much do you expect us to pay for that ? ' but with the current economic climate it seems to be a great way to make movies . "
So , what exactly did Price spend the famous $ 70 on ?
" We bought a crowbar and a couple of tapes , and I think we got some tea and coffee as well -- not the expensive stuff either , the very basic kind , " Price told CNN .
" Just to keep the zombies happy . "
' Secret ' CIA document on White House Flickr feed
A photograph posted by the White House to the photo sharing website Flickr includes an image of a document with the letters CIA printed beneath what appears to be the word " secret . "
The photograph by White House photographer Pete Souza is one of 301 pictures currently in the White House 's Flickr pool , and depicts President Obama and six of his top advisors in the Red Room before Wednesday 's prime time news conference .
In the picture , foreign policy advisor Denis McDonough holds a binder , a legal pad , and some loose paper , with the top sheet bearing the acronym for the Central Intelligence Agency , which is clearly visible in an enlarged , 3500 - pixel wide image available on Flickr .
The other words on the visible portion of the document are n't easily legible , and a White House spokesman , Bill Burton , dismissed it as innocuous in an email .
" Uh oh .
Please do n't tell me that the enemy is now going to know what our fax coversheets look like .
( That is indeed what it is . ) , " he emailed .
[ UPDATE : However , the White House removed the picture from the Internet immediately after being asked about it by a reporter . ]
The ability of high - powered lenses to capture the text of documents led to the resignation earlier this month of a top English police official , who exposed secret documents to cameras ; the portion of a secret document visible here is obviously nowhere near as clear in this photograph .
In the enlarged version of another image from the pool , the President can be seen to be reading POLITICO .
UPDATE : The original image , removed from Flickr , is here :
With its grotesquely exaggerated features , this could easily be the work of one of the 20th century 's great figurative artists .
But this voluptuous Venus was carved out of a mammoth 's tusk more than 35,000 years ago .
The two - and - a - half - inch statuette was found buried 10 feet below the floor of the Hohle Fels Cave in the Schwabian region of south - west Germany , where archaeologists have already discovered a gallery of early art objects dating to the same period of the Stone Age .
Carbon dating has shown that the female figurine predates other similar Venus carvings by about 5,000 years .
" This figurine was produced at least 35,000 calendar years ago , making it one of the oldest known examples of figurative art , " said Nicholas Conard of the University of Tubingen , who describes the statuette in Nature .
He added that it " radically changes our views of the context and meaning of the earliest Palaeolithic art " .

The oldest known works of art are abstract engravings – geometric designs in red iron oxide – found at a cave site in southern Africa and dated to about 75,000 years ago .
Figurative cave paintings in southern France of Stone Age animals such as bison , horses , deer and rhinos , have been dated to about 37,000 years ago .
But the Venus figurine unearthed from the cave in Germany is the oldest known statuette depicting the human form .
As the earliest example of three - dimensional figurative art , it could represent the birth of true sculpture in the global artistic tradition , according to scientists who have studied the piece .
The carving was made from a solid piece of mammoth ivory and depicts a naked woman with grossly protruding breasts , swollen thighs and belly , and a greatly enlarged and explicit vulva .
A disproportionately small head was probably used to hang the figurine , according to Paul Mellars , of Stony Brook University in New York .
" The figure is explicitly – and blatantly – that of a woman , with exaggerated sexual characteristics ... that by 21st - century standards could be seen as bordering on the pornographic , " said Dr Mellars .
" As if to emphasise the sexual characteristics , the figure 's arms and legs are severely reduced to the form of a carefully carved ring , evidently to allow the figure to be suspended from a string or thong . "
Similar Venus figurines with exaggerated sexual features and diminutive arms and legs have been found at a range of Stone Age archaeological sites stretching from the Pyrenees to southern Russia .
These examples of early figurative art have been linked with the so - called Gravettian toolmaking culture dating to 25,000 - 29,000 years ago .
The latest Venus figurine is also adorned with enigmatic and possibly symbolic markings in the form of repeatedly incised lines that might conceivably represent the depiction of clothing , according to Dr Mellars .
Other Venus figurines from the later period also show criss - cross designs or patterns etched on to their surfaces .
" The feature of the newly discovered figure that will undoubtedly command most attention is its explicitly , almost aggressively , sexual nature , focused on the sexual characteristics of the female form , " said Dr Mellars .
Europe , 35,000 years ago , was in the process of being colonised by anatomically " modern " man , Homo sapiens , who had migrated from Africa via the Middle East .
This species was gradually replacing Europe 's Neanderthal man , a species that had inhabited the continent for thousands of years .
Four sites in southern Germany have produced a total of 25 mammoth - ivory carvings depicting a range of animals , from mammoths and horses to bison and cave bears .
" The same sites have also yielded numerous small , carved ivory beads or pendants and the world 's oldest unmistakable musical instruments , " said Dr Mellars .
" These take the form of perforated flutes manufactured from segments of bird wing bone . "
The cave paintings of southern France may be older than the Venus figurine , " but the cornucopia of small , carved ivory statuettes from the south German sites must be seen as the birthplace of true sculpture in the European artistic tradition , " added Dr Mellars .
WASHINGTON  An Internet radio host known for his incendiary views was arrested Wednesday in North Bergen , N.J. , after federal officials charged that his angry postings about a gun case in Chicago amounted to death threats against three judges .
In a case that tests the limits of free speech , the Justice Department charged that the radio host , Hal Turner , had crossed the line into hate speech .
Mr. Turner , regarded by civil rights monitoring groups as a white supremacist , an anti-Semite and a “ maestro of radio hate , ” posted commentaries on his blog denouncing a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit , in Chicago , that upheld two local bans on handguns .
“ Let me be the first to say this plainly :
These judges deserve to be killed , ” Mr. Turner wrote in a blog entry on June 2 .
“ Their blood will replenish the tree of liberty .
A small price to pay to assure freedom for millions . ”
LONDON ( Reuters ) - Security at the G20 summit next week will rest in part on Britain ’s pervasive closed circuit cameras , but in future pre-emptive surveillance could extend to the entire country ’s personal data .
That is the vision outlined by former security chief David Omand in a study of intelligence methods seen by privacy campaigners as a plan for a vast breach of human rights .
“ Finding out other people ’s secrets is going to involve breaking everyday moral rules , ” he said in the paper for the Institute of Public Policy Research , an influential think tank .
“ Application of modern data mining and processing techniques does involve examination of the innocent as well as the suspect to identify patterns of interest for further investigation . ”
In an interview , Omand said : “ If you have the advantage of pre-emptive intelligence , then you are able to use the rapier , not the bludgeon , of state power . ”
Law enforcement agencies can already access personal data in a criminal investigation .
What is new is the proposal to examine the data purely to identify leads for further investigation .
Analysts say the study by Omand , the cabinet ’s Security and Intelligence Coordinator in 2002 - 05 , may be an indicator of the kind of reforms the security agencies may seek in coming years .
It may also point to changes elsewhere , as British surveillance practice is often emulated by countries who see Britain as a leader in using technology to snoop on its own people .
Omand says a growing target for spies is not the street , where an estimated 4.2 million closed circuit television ( CCTV ) cameras already operate throughout Britain , but personal data held on computers that forms the stuff of personal life .
This means databases of airline bookings , advance passenger information , financial , telephone , tax , health , passport and biometric records and phone and internet communications .
“ Where I disagree with many who warn of the dangers of the ‘ surveillance society ’ is that I think these methods are necessary for counter - terrorism , provided they are properly regulated , ” he said .
SACRIFICING PRIVACY
“ I think the British public would be on my side given the still significant threat from terrorism , ” said Omand , a former director of the Government Communications Headquarters , an intelligence agency that intercepts electronic communications .
Omand says the state needs this power because Britain is more vulnerable to disruption as it becomes more networked and IT - dependent .
Also , he says , sacrificing some privacy is preferable to other ways of boosting security such as altering the criminal law to make it easier to convict .
“ This is a hard choice , ” he said .
“ But ... it is greatly preferable to tinkering with the rule of law , or derogating from fundamental human rights , ” he wrote .
Omand says surveillance should be subject to an authorizing process with clear accountability to safeguard “ public trust in the essential reasonableness ” of British security action .
It will be for parliament eventually to decide the limits of such surveillance , and some analysts fear MPs will permit wide powers .
Britons , with no experience of invasion or occupation in their modern history , are traditionally tolerant of state power provided it is seen to be wielded benignly .
Omand ’s critics have been quick to speak up .
Ken MacDonald , a former Director of Public Prosecutions , said if spies trawled the data of people suspected of no crime they “ would become , in peoples ’ eyes , essentially objectionable and oppressive .
They would be viewed with hostility . ”
“ This is because to abolish the distinction between suspects and those suspected of nothing , to place them in entirely the same category in the eyes of the State , is an unmistakable hallmark of authoritarianism . ”
Omand 's paper is availablehere
Update 5/18/09 : This Blue Sky Homes prototype is complete !
Just the other day , we mentioned a beautiful green home designed by o2 architecture , but they ’ve also been involved with another interesting company , Blue Sky Homes .
Blue Sky Homes was created to be a next generation prefab company — they ’ve developed a system to construct homes faster , stronger , greener , cheaper , and easier than standard industry practice .
The Blue Sky Homes Building System involves fabricating the elements of the home in a factory and assembling those pieces on the job site .
And they ’re testing this system on a 1,000 square foot prototype home in Yucca Valley right now .
The prototype is being built with steel , but it ’s actually a light - gauge , cold - formed steel , which incorporates recycled steel in a less - intense and more affordable process .
With this process , Blue Sky Homes can produce strong homes and quick on - site assembly .
More specifically , footings to envelope = ~ 5 days , and entire home construction = ~ seven weeks .
Blue Sky Homes is planning a full catalog of home designs for future release , and pricing information will be forthcoming as well .
Their designs incorporate a number of green elements and products : bamboo and FSC - certified cabinetry , solar PV , solar hot water panels , grey water system , low - VOC paints , high - performance double - E windows and doors , Energy Star appliances , efficient STEPs ( steel thermal efficiency panels ) , and the allowance of abundant natural light .
The Yucca Valley Prototype House began construction on March 10 , 2009 , and we ’re excitedly monitoring progress on Blue Sky Homes ’ website to see the finished home .
If these renderings are any indicator , the home will be an absolute stunner .
You watch .

Some cool EarCandy 0.4 features :
To install it , open a terminal and :
bzr branch lp:~killerkiwi2005/eyecandy/0.4 earcandycd earcandy./ear_candy
[ Linux only ]
EarCandy is a PulseAudio volume manager that automatically changes your sound depending on the current application using it .
For instance if you listen to music and a Skype call comes in , the music will fade out ( based on your settings ) until it 's turned off , and the skype sound will be the only one running .
Or if you listen to music and then play a YouTube video , the music will be again turned off and you will only hear the sound of the YouTube video .
The application does n't have a fancy interface , it only does what it 's supposed to , and does it well .
Here is a video with an older version of EarCandy and Skype in action : - If you plug in an USB handset , the audio will be automatically transferred to it .
-A tray applet that looks like the Gnome volume applet lets you adjus the behaviour .
- You cna easly adjust the sound fade speed .
- You can lock the volume : in case you do n't want EarCandy to change the volume anymore , you can lock it .
- Smart volume detection : fixes some problems with YouTube .
Before , if for instance you played and then stopped a YouTube video , the sound in your music player would have been turned off with no option to turn it on .
This was fixed in version 0.4 .
- In this version , EarCandy tries to figure out which application is a video player , a music player and so on , so it can automatically add them so you do n't have to do it manually .
PS : if you had an older version of Earcandy install , remove remove it before running 0.4 Then play some music in your favourite music player and then play a YouTube video .
Yesterday the Social Security and Medicare trustees ’ reports were released .
This annual ritual often gives reporters a chance to exaggerate the long - term problems of the Social Security system .
This year , the news was more or less what folks were expecting :
By the trustees ’ forecasting , Social Security ’s trust fund will be depleted in 2037 , while Medicare ’s hospital fund will run out of money in 2017 .
Somehow , the Washington Post decided that Social Security was the real concern–its page - one story is headlined “ Alarm Sounded on Social Security . ”
The lead rings the same bells :
The financial health of the Social Security system has eroded more sharply in the past year than at any time since the mid-1990s , according to a government forecast that ratchets up pressure on the Obama administration and Congress to stabilize the retirement system that keeps many older Americans out of poverty .
Much less attention is given to Medicare , which the Post does tell us deep in the piece “ remains the more urgent problem . ”
The paper sure has a funny way of showing its urgent concern , though .
As FAIR noted , former Fed chair Alan Greenspan tried to provide some perspective about Social Security and Medicare two years ago .
When NBC‘s Tim Russert asked him about the health of Social Security and Medicare , Greenspan said that Social Security ’s problems were minor .
Economist and former Social Security trustee Robert Reich writes , “ Do n’t be confused by these alarms from the Social Security and Medicare trustees .
Social Security is a tiny problem .
Medicare is a terrible one . ”
The Washington Post , for reasons that are n’t entirely clear , are sending a very different message .
As Dean Baker has documented for some time , the paper just seems to have something against the program .
The first ever exhibition of computer generated art was held at the Howard Wise Gallery in New York , in April 1965 .
It was entitled “ Computer Generated Pictures ” , as people agreed that the potentially dehumanising influence of the computer prevented the pieces in the show from being considered ‘ art ’ in the true sense of the word .
The computer has since become a central feature of much contemporary art , be it in the execution , reconfiguration or reproduction of work .
Entire artistic disciplines like algorithm art , software art and digital illustration have evolved with computers at their very core .
This article takes a closer look at seven contemporary pieces where computers have been used to fascinating and often beautiful effect .

Dombis then arranges the images into colour groups , creating large , often monochromatic , lenticular prints .
2. “ Computer Virus 2.0 ” by Joseph Nechvatal ( 2002 )
“ Computer Virus 2.0 ” is an electronic virus - attack art installation .
In other words , it ’s a video piece which documents the behaviour of a computer - generated virus .
The computer virus has been specifically programmed to behave like a biological virus as it degrades and transforms one of Nechvatal ’s digital paintings .
3. “ Blowing in the Wind ” by Gilles Tran ( 2007 )
“ Blowing in the Wind ” is one of many examples of Tran ’s surrealist 3D work .
Tran is famous for his use of POV - Ray , although this particular image and much of his most recent work has been modelled with Cinema 4D .
Tran allows other artists to download aspect of his 3D images ( the fire extinguisher in this piece for example ) from his website , for use in their own work .
4. “ The Draftmasters ” by Victor Adan , Jeff Snyder & Daniel Iglesia ( 2009 )
This high - tech , multi-sensory piece combines performance with computer generated art .
A computer is used to translate physical gestures , made by Adan and Snyder on stage , into vector commands that drive pen-plotter printers and printer inks .
Iglesia then uses another computer system to convert the movement of the printers into 3D images for the audience to view .
5. “ Every Playboy Centrefold , The Decades ” by Jason Salavon ( 2004 )
The four reconfigured photographic images in this series feature all the Playboy centrefolds from four particular decades ( 1960s , 1970s , 1980s and 1990s ) .
Salavon creates his signature blurred photographic effect by overlaying numerous photographs and averaging the results by computer , to make a visual amalgamation .
6. “ Abundance ” by Camille Utterback ( 2007 )
“ Abundance ” is a video installation that converts the movement of pedestrians , captured by a camera mounted in San Jose ’s City Hall plaza , into colourful silhouettes and patterns that are projected onto a nearby 3 - storey rotunda .
7. “ Falling Girl ” by Scott Snibbe & Annie Lou ( 2008 )
This interactive video installation depicts a girl slowly falling from the top of a tall building .
Cameras situated in the gallery allow viewers to control the movements of figures who appear in the building ’s windows as she falls .
The falling girl visibly ages on her descent , becoming an old woman before eventually hitting the ground .

Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak holds a press conference with visiting Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu in Sharm el - Sheikh , Egypt. ( Zhang Ning / Sipa )
The mere offer signified a de facto acceptance of the Zionist colonial implant in the region as well as submission to its military dominance .
It was thus with no surprise that Israel did not rush to accept the plan .
Israel ’s response was that of complete indifference .
After all , why would Israel rush to define its borders and give away parts of Jerusalem to a future Palestinian “ state , ” when the Arab governments inadvertently gave legitimacy and comfort to Israel ’s ongoing policies of ethnic cleansing inside Palestine ?
The plan was reaffirmed at the Arab League ’s 2007 summit in Riyadh where only Libya was missing .
Muammar al - Qaddhafi , who has ruled Libya for the past 40 years , professed allegiance to the principles of the old - guard .
Explaining the reasons for the lone Libyan boycott , Foreign Minister Abdel Rahman Shalgham argued that “ all the Arabs now consider Iran to be the main enemy and have forgotten Israel ; ” Arabs “ keep pressing the Palestinians to respond to the conditions of the Quartet , no one presses Israel . ”
Libya had a point .
There has been a shift in regional alliances , whereby an overlapping of interests united the West , Arab regimes ( now increasingly identified as “ Sunni ” in an overtly sectarian discourse ) and Israel against Iran .
Arab states have historically lacked a consistent commitment to the Palestinians .
Deeply divided , the Palestinian cause had often been used to distract discontent from problems at home and to advance the populist agendas of Arab dictators .
Even prior to the creation of Israel , King Abdullah I of Jordan had expressed his commitment to an exclusive Jewish state in Palestine .
He did n’t sign a peace deal with Israel earlier on for fear of isolation .
That taboo was broken in 1979 by Egypt — the most populous Arab country — gradually redefining the limits of what the autocratic Arab regimes could get away without risking their seats of power in face of popular discontent .
Egypt and Saudi Arabia , the most influential of these countries , are now leading the anti-Iran campaign .
Iran ’s threat to their regional dominance coupled with a dose of anti-Shiite hostility , has led them to take Israel as a convenient ally .
Israel on the other hand is anxious to quash Iran , an opponent to its regional supremacy .
In an address to last February to the annual gathering of Israel ’s political - military elite in Herzliya , former Israeli Foreign Minister Tzipi Livni clarified this view : “ Being used to feeling secluded in the Middle East , with the whole Arab world against us , we look around and suddenly notice other countries alongside Israel — Arab , Islamic countries , who no longer view Israel as the enemy , countries who understand that Iran is the main enemy , seeing Iran as no less a threat than we do . ”
US President Barack Obama is keen to capitalize on these cleavages so to facilitate the shifting of alliances that would form the basis for a new Middle East .
His administration is currently developing a comprehensive strategy to consolidate this emerging alliance into meaningful actions to deter Iran and transform the overlap in interests into enduring relationships .
The Palestinian issue , as the prime arena for the power play of regional forces , is a pivotal avenue to close the current vacuum .
And this is where the Arab Peace Initiative comes back into play .
One of the recently mooted changes to this initiative is the adoption of the model currently in use in negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians , that of gestures of goodwill before a fully fledged agreement — or even full blown negotiations — is in place .
As recently reported by the Israeli daily Haaretz , the US expects the Arab states to take steps towards normalization as gestures of goodwill towards Israel .
Obama made this explicit in his 18 May press conference with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu , when the president stated that “ Arab states have to be more supportive and be bolder in seeking potential normalization with Israel . ”
The last 15 years of negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority has more than proven the failure of this model .
Goodwill , or outright collaboration by the Palestinian Authority , led only to the entrenchment of Israel ’s colonial system .
The Arab League ’s campaign of normalization will contribute to enhance the international legitimacy of Israel ’s racist regime , this in spite of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu ’s open rejection of the plan .
Ironic .
Western - aligned Arab regimes have already already taken significant steps towards normalization .
They cheered the last two Israeli massacres , Lebanon in 2006 and Gaza in 2009 , refusing to take decisive steps towards a ceasefire .
Egypt and Saudi Arabia boycotted an Arab League meeting in January , buying time for Israel to “ finish the job ” in Gaza .
Last April , King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia took another massive step towards full normalization and met with Israel ’s president , war criminal Shimon Peres in New York .
Fearing backlash , the Saudi propaganda machine was quick to deny such a meeting took place .
( The trend has not been uniform however ; responding to public outrage at Israel ’s Gaza massacre , Qatar closed in January an Israeli trade office it had hosted for years as part of normalization steps taken since the 1993 Oslo accords . )
In light of these state - led efforts to normalize Israel ’s ethnic cleansing and ghettoization of the Palestinians under a racist apartheid regime , how can we bring back into the equation principles of justice , equality and human rights ?
How can we ensure the refugees are afforded the right to return to their homes , that there is equality between Israelis and Palestinians , and ultimately the peace with justice ?
When governments consistently fail to act in support of these principles , pursuing instead undemocratic agendas , ordinary people should take the struggle into their own hands .
People of conscience around the world should step up efforts for boycott , divestments and sanctions ( BDS ) of Israel as per the 2005 call of Palestinian civil society organizations .
This will ultimately become a powerful force capable of counteracting state - led efforts to legitimize Israel ’s system of oppression .
Israel is waging a battle for legitimacy and as Howard Kohr , AIPAC ’s executive director recently admitted , BDS has the potential to shift the odds in favor of justice .
These grassroots efforts are particularly timely in Arab and Muslim countries , where there is n’t yet a significant movement to this end , at a time where their despotic governments are raising the white flag of surrender to Israel .

Liz Renay ’s Adam and Eve ( 1961 ) .
Sure to be one of the most talked - about documentaries at this year ’s Sundance Film Festival , Louie Psihoyos ’s The Cove is part heist movie , part environmental exposé .
The cove in question is a secluded and naturally fortified lagoon in the small Japanese town of Taiji , where every year for six months thousands of dolphins are brutally slaughtered .
The film is in part about the efforts of a group of activists to infiltrate the cove and to actually film what goes on there .
Leading the charge is Richard O’Barry , a longtime activist who was responsible for training the dolphins on the sixties TV show Flipper .
Indeed ,
The Cove is also the story of O’Barry ’s journey , documenting how he came to be a self - described “ abolitionist ” for dolphins .
He spoke to Vulture about his new film , watching TV with Flipper , and the increasingly elaborate disguises he has to wear when he goes to Taiji .
You know , when I was a kid , I always wanted to live in the Flipper house .
I used to live in that house !
It was right in the Miami Seaquarium there .
I have such wonderful halcyon memories of those days .
There was n’t even a fence around the Seaquarium .
It was like magic .
Until the wheels fell off .
You had captured the dolphins on Flipper , right ?
I captured the five dolphins that collectively played the part of Flipper .
I trained all of them , from the very beginning of the first show to the last show .
I lived with all five of them in the Seaquarium .
And on Friday nights , at 7:30 , I would take the TV set , with a long extension cord , out to the end of the dock , so Flipper could watch Flipper on television .
And that ’s when I knew they were self - aware .
I could tell when the dolphins recognized themselves and each other .
Cathy , for example , would recognize the shots she was in , Suzy would recognize her shots , and so on .
Dolphins are hard to read , because you have to look at body language .
Almost all other animals you can read by looking at their faces .
But dolphins have this built - in “ smile ” that makes it look like they ’re always happy .
How did your ideas about captivity turn around ?
Cathy died in my arms , of suicide .
It was just before Earth Day , 1970 .
The next day , I found myself in a Bimini jail , trying to free a dolphin for the first time .
I completely lost it .
How do you know it was suicide ?
You have to understand , dolphins are not automatic air breathers like we are .
Every breath for them is a conscious effort .
She looked me right in the eye , took a breath , held it — and she did n’t take another one .
She just sank to the bottom of the water .
That had a profound effect on me .
The footage of the dolphin slaughter you filmed in The Cove is pretty staggering .
Has anyone else seen it yet ?
The world will see it Sunday , at Sundance .
Even the Japanese do n’t know about this .
I went onto the street in Tokyo , and I showed the footage to a hundred people walking down the sidewalk , and none of them knew this was happening .
That ’s the only hope , to expose this to the world .
It wo n’t be easy .
The film will probably be banned in Japan .
I ’m hoping Jim Clark , who is our partner on this , can figure out a way to get it seen there .
If he can invent Netscape , he can figure that out , as well .
In the meantime , we also have our website , SaveJapanDolphins.org , where people can learn more about this issue .
But killing dolphins is actually legal in Japan .
Yes , but let ’s not forget that the place in question here is a national park .
They ’re killing the wildlife in a national park .
They do n’t have jurisdiction there .
They ’re just a bunch of thugs .
As for the broader issue of legality :
One percent of the Japanese population eats whale meat , and a very small percentage of that one percent eats dolphin or even knows that people eat dolphin .
That ’s one of the reasons I ’m opposed to a boycott of Japan .
In the seventies and eighties , there was a big effort to stop whaling by taking out full - page ads in newspapers that said , “ Save the Whales .
Boycott Japan . ”
Japanese people are not guilty of this .
They do n’t know it ’s happening .
Japanese papers and networks do not cover this story .
So if nobody is eating dolphin meat , why is this slaughter happening ?
I think it ’s really about over - fishing .
It ’s a worldwide problem .
Basically , they ’re killing the competition , because each of those dolphins eats 25 to 30 pounds of fish .
As for the dolphin meat , nobody really knows where it goes .
They kill 23,000 dolphins a year : I have no idea where that meat goes .
You ca n’t really even buy it in Taiji .
I ’m thinking it might be exported to places that have a protein shortage .
We had this meat tested , and the mercury levels on it is through the roof .
It ’s contaminated .
Have you been back to Taiji since you shot this footage ?
I go five or six times a year , during the killing season , which is six months .
I ’m constantly there .
I ’ll go anytime anybody will go with me — CNN , BBC , you name it .
It ’s gotten so dangerous now that I have to wear disguises when I first get there .
The last time , I was wearing a long black wig , sunglasses , my Michael Jackson mask over my mouth , a dress , and lipstick .
I had to dress as a woman because they ’re looking for a man .
What will they do if they catch you ?
The biggest danger is not so much the fishermen , although they are angry and some of the younger ones have said they would kill us if they could get away with it .
But it ’s really the yakuza , who are very connected to the whaling and fishing industries .
In Japan , that ’s how problems like me are solved , how people who cause trouble are often dealt with .
Especially in a lot of these small towns , you do n’t call the police , you call the yakuza .
What about people who say that , while the footage in The Cove is quite grisly , a regular slaughterhouse would also look pretty horrific to people if they could see it ?
They ’re absolutely correct .
The one difference is that the dolphins are terrorized for days , as the fishermen intrude on their migration patterns and then chase them into the lagoon with loud noises .
But yes , the slaughterhouse is an absolute horror show .
It ’s a separate issue , and some of us are working on that as well .
But that does n’t justify what they ’re doing to the dolphins .

Yes , you read that thrilling dramatization right :
The man whose range is so limited that 90 percent of the characters he plays could shop at the same black trenchcoat store has been earmarked to play a both sides of a split personality .
It 's an onscreen interaction that I 'm betting will be a little less Smeagle / Gollum and a little more Neo / Neo with angry eyebrows drawn on .
In fact , I think itâs safe to assume that the only personality combinations he can realistically bring to the role are : Iâm hoping he goes with the first one , so we can watch Dr. Jekyll wage a grim fight against Mr. Hydeâs quest to invent Cheetos , thrash on the 19th century equivalent of an electric bass ( which I believe would be the steam - bassoon ) and hassle Tchaikovsky .
Plus the constant switch between a black duster and bright neon shorts is probably the only way the audience will know which character heâs supposed to be playing at any given time .
Keanu , if youâre reading this , donât panic .
Iâve got some simple , quick fixes that will help you give the impression of being able to play two whole characters , without actually going to all the fuss of doing so .
First , try some thick accents .
No oneâs going to confuse your Jekyll and Hyde if Jekyll introduces himself as a âman uh da sciences , eh?â  and Hyde vows to âshtop at nosink !â 
Yes , itâs borderline racist , but if you settle for your usual caliber of performance , you risk offending facial paralysis victims everywhere .
If that doesnât do the trick , give Hyde a thin black mustache .
Itâll make him seem a lot more evil , and itâs easier to explain how a man can grow and ungrow facial hair throughout a movie than to explain how in the hell the producers thought you were a good choice for this role .
Of course , thereâs also the âmethodâ route .
â Methodâ is a fancy actor word for actually doing whatever your character is supposed to do .
So if youâre playing a crackhead , smoke some crack .
Itâs like cheating for actors .
I guess what Iâm saying is that you should try to invent a serum that turns you into a monster .
Difficult , yes , but much easier thanâ ¦ well , you know .
And if all else fails , thereâs always subtitles .
Oh and hey , Keanu , while Iâve got your attention : SPIKE ?!
Youâre playing fucking SPIKE SPIEGEL ?!
How DARE you !
Get the hell away from Bebop !
Or better yet , go method : Hurl yourself into space .
When not writing less and less frequently for Cracked , Michael is working on a number of all - consuming secret projects , so please stop messaging him and calling him lazy , you fuckers .

Many want to try to complicate their entry into BDSM .
They believe that they will increase their success if they spend an enormous amount of money on BDSM ' toys ' .
For those who are in a position to drop thousands , it might be a way to go .
However , for those who have to live within a budget , another path is needed .
For this reason , I will share four accessories I feel necessary to get started in BDSM .
Bondage is a vital component to the lifestyle .
Most subs will be happier if you restrain them .
However , cuffs and exotic bondage devices cost a small fortune .
The best way around this is rope from your local hardware store .
There are many styles which work .
Look for something soft and flexible to allow for a variety of knots .
Get yourself a couple hundred feet worth to start .
This will allow you to cut segments different lengths to be used for restraints .
There are a variety ways to go for this .
My personal preference is the riding bat .
I picked a couple up at the local feed store for about half the price of one at the sex shop .
Paddles or riding crops also work well .
Again , seek stores other than the local adult toy store .
Hardware and craft stores often carry items which can be used as a substitute .
This is basic , inexpensive , and crucial .
Blindfolding a sub will enhance any scene .
I love the element of surprise this offers .
Purchase the inexpensive ones at your local discount dollar store .
Plain white without all the fancy fragrances is preferable .
This will eliminate the potential for allergic reactions to the dyes and perfumes in them .
Wax play is something that most find desirable .
A cheap candle burns at a low hear , thus providing discomfort without injury .
Most subs like it on their nipples while a few can handle it on the genitalia .
All these items are inexpensive and easy to obtain .
Start to fill your ' toy box ' with these items .
They are versatile in their uses while providing a basis for the BDSM scene .
As your desires and abilities evolves , then you can move onto more expensive items .
However , this is ideal for getting started .
First , I 'd like to allay the fears of all those in Cringeville .
You can not catch swine flu by using Twitter -- even if you 're one of Porky 's followers .
But you would n't know it by looking at the swirl of misinformation and panic that has flooded everybody 's favorite microblog .
Net.effect 's Evgeny Morozov says the swine flu has turned the Twitterati into the jitterati :
There are quite a few reasons to be concerned about Twitter 's role in facilitating an unnecessary global panic about swine flu ... having millions of people wrap up all their fears into 140 characters and blurt them out in the public might have some dangerous consequences , networked panic being one of them .
What could happen ?
People shun bacon and ham , sending the pork bellies market into freefall .
People cancel their travel plans , especially to Latin America , and walk around wearing surgical masks .
People with head colds decide they 're really dying from a porcine - borne bug and flood emergency rooms .
That in turn could cause shortages of the Tamiflu vaccine for those who actually need it .

And did you know that swine flu is n't really a flu at all but an attack of Advanced Biological Warfare aimed at reconfiguring our DNA ?
Hey I read it on the Interwebs , so it must be true .
In fact , the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has its own Twitter feed , which as I write this boasts 14,139 followers , or only 1,439,680 less than Ashton Kutcher .
Its latest tweet :
20 confirmed cases of swine flu in U.S. 1 hospitalized .
All have fully recovered .
http://bit.ly/uycgL
#swineflu
See , not so much to worry about .
The problem is that , unlike most Twitter users , the CDC only tweets when it actually has something to say .
That little info - snippet went out 14 hours ago .
Meanwhile , a glance at Twitter search shows tweets with the tag # swineflu coming in at the rate of around 20 per minute .
That 's a rumor / panic / speculation - to - information ratio of more than 16,000 to 1 .
Google Flu Trends , which tracks the incidence of people searching for terms related to " flu , " puts the current swine flu threat as almost minimal .
Google says its search data tracks very closely to actual flu treatments recorded by the CDC .
But what happens to Google Flu when panic causes a surge in searches , bumping the search trend into the red ?
Flu
Trends then becomes part of the endless cycle of hysteria .
There are plenty of credible sources for information about swine flu on the Web ; Mashable 's Ben Parr offers a guide to some here ;
Time magazine offers up five things you need to know ; and of course , the CDC Web site .
The bigger problem , as Morozov points out , is how unrestrained social media could be manipulated toward far worse ends :
I think it 's only a matter of time before the next generation of cyber - terrorists – those who are smart about social media , are familiar with modern information flows , and are knowledgeable about human networks – take advantage of the escalating fears over the next epidemic and pollute the networked public sphere with scares that would essentially paralyze the global economy .
Often , such tactics would bring much more destruction than the much - feared cyberwar and attacks on physical – rather than human – networks .
The real problem is n't Twitter ( or Facebook , et al. ) , the problem is a ) stupid people , and b ) people who prey on stupid people .
Included in that last group are the 24/7 cable news networks , who will do anything to whip viewers into a frenzy to boost their ratings , and the blogs who 'll do the same to pump up their page views .
So I make this vow :
This blog will sell no swine flu before its time .
Also :
Do n't believe everything you read on Twitter .
Even if Ashton is your BFF .
Are you sick of swine flu hysteria , or is it Twitter that 's making you twitchy ?
Post your thoughts below or e-mail me direct : cringe@infoworld.com .
But please , wash your hands before you type -- you can't be too careful .
Afghani police announced that NATO forces shot and killed a 12 - year - old girl and two other civilians in western Afghanistan .

CARACAS ( Reuters ) - Venezuela ’s garrulous President Hugo Chavez on Thursday began a marathon four - day edition of his trademark television show to mark 10 years since the influential and widely watched program first hit the airwaves .

Chavez is a tireless talker who uses frequent television appearances to make policy announcements , berate opponents and even sing during rambling speeches often delivered in the florid vernacular of working class Venezuelans .
Normally transmitted on Sundays from a different corner of the South American oil exporting nation each week , ‘ Alo Presidente ’ is the boisterous socialist ’s favorite forum , with the program once running to eight hours .
“ ‘ Alo Presidente ’ starts today and finishes this Sunday , we do n’t know at what time , ” Chavez said at the start of Thursday ’s program broadcast from an electricity plant in Venezuela ’s oil heartland state Zulia .
Venezuela ’s media reflect its polarized society , with government stations strongly supporting Chavez and private newspapers and Globovision TV relentlessly critical of the president and his policies .
Chavez believes strongly in the political power of the press and TV .
In 2007 he refused to renew the license of the nation ’s largest television station , implicated in a brief coup against him .
This year he has increased pressure on Globovision .
Chavez , who keeps his energy levels high with multiple cups of coffee , has used his television show to announce nationalizations , and rail against the United States .
He once shocked his defense minister on the show by ordering tanks to the border with Colombia .
On Thursday he began the program giving sexual education tips to a group of teenagers and talked about problems with his weight , which has ballooned since he took office in 1999 .
Chavez also quoted from a letter written by his close friend Fidel Castro , in which the former Cuban president said “ Alo Presidente ” had broadcast a total of 1536 hours , or 64 full days , since it was first aired .
“ Never has a revolutionary idea made use of the media so effectively , ” Castro wrote .

A new Florida city , Babcock Ranch , will power 19,500 homes by solar power and cost the average customer 's monthly bill an additional 31 cents .
This will be the first city on earth powered by zero-emission solar energy .
The new city is being developed by Kitson & Partners on 17,000 acres northeast of Fort Myers .
The city will include the world 's largest photovoltaic power plant , which will be operated by Florida Power & Light .
The concept behind this 75 - megawatt solar generator is that it will produce more power for the state 's electric grid while the sun shines than the city will use in 24 hours .
For the evening and night time hours , Babcock Ranch will have to rely on conventional power sources but its net effect will be a solar power city .
FPL estimates the Babcock Ranch solar facility will cost about $ 300 million and sit on 350 acres within the development .
Kitson & Partners are also working on projects in the up coming years that include adding 1,200 megawatts of power fueled by natural gas in Palm Beach County and 2,200 megawatts of new nuclear power at Turkey Point .
A study by Fishkind & Associates reported that the city of Babcock Ranch will generate 20,000 permanent jobs plus thousands of temporary positions for the construction of the new city .
Babcock Ranch will have an integrated '' smart grid ' ' that will allow power users to monitor and control their energy consumption .
All commercial buildings and homes in the new city will be certified as energy - efficient and construction will comply with Florida 's Green Building Council standards .
Pending approvals , groundbreaking on the solar plant could start later this year and construction of the city center could begin next year .
Included in the development will be six million square feet of retail , commercial , office , civic and light industrial space .

WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - Name a top issue and President Barack Obama has probably got a “ czar ” responsible for tackling it .
A bank bailout czar ?
Herb Allison .
Energy czar ?
Carol Browner .
There ’s a drug czar , a U.S. border czar , an urban czar , a regulatory czar , a stimulus accountability czar , an Iran czar , a Middle East czar , and a czar for both Afghanistan and Pakistan , which in Washington - speak has been lumped together into a policy area called Af - Pak .
There are upward of 20 such top officials , all with lengthy official titles but known in the media as czars , and next week there will be one more , when Obama appoints a czar for cyber - security who will be charged with improving the security of computer networks .
“ In short , America ’s economic prosperity in the 21st century will depend on cyber - security , ” Obama said on Friday .
Experts say Obama ’s reliance on czars can be helpful by focusing attention on a big issue and making someone responsible for it , but that it can also lead to turf fights and add another cumbersome bureaucratic layer .
Or , as Republican Senator John McCain likes to say , Obama has “ more czars than the Romanovs , ” who ruled Russia for three centuries .
On cyber - security specifically , some with deep knowledge of U.S. national security issues say having a central coordinator in charge would be helpful .
Ken Wainstein , who was former President George W. Bush ’s homeland security adviser , said the issues inherent to cyber - security cross many different government agencies , from the Department of Homeland Security to the ultra-secret National Security Agency , to the Defense Department , and on .
“ It ’s a big issue that has a lot government players so it needs some coordination , ” said Wainstein , now at the law firm O’Melveny & Myers .
“ It also helps to raise the profile of the issue within the bureaucracy to ensure the issue is addressed aggressively .
Our cyber systems are being attacked on a regular basis , ” he said .
‘ OUTSIDE FORMAL CHANNELS ’
Bruce Buchanan , a University of Texas political science professor , said that in some respects Obama looks to be relying on a formula from his successful election campaign last year -- making top people responsible for various parts of his sprawling operation .
“ It does seem to facilitate going outside formal channels and creating ad hoc solutions , ” he said .
“ I think it makes sense .
It ’s the way he operates . ”
Many analysts are carefully watching what happens at Obama ’s State Department , where Secretary of State Hillary Clinton is in overall charge but has a number of top envoys working on many central issues .
Veteran diplomat Richard Holbrooke has the Afghanistan - Pakistan portfolio , Dennis Ross is the Iran point person and George Mitchell is the Middle East envoy .
Buchanan said it is up to Obama to make sure they all work together and that rival power centers do not develop that compete for the president ’s favor .
“ The key is whether the president is adept at managing the kind of pathologies that can flow out of setting up these rival power centers , ” Buchanan said .
Linda Fowler , a professor of government at Dartmouth College in New Hampshire , said presidents often appoint czars in a symbolic move to show they care about an issue .
They also are trying to control a sprawling bureaucracy , she added .
“ Presidents of both parties have done this because they are all dealing with this problem , this huge bureaucracy that has built up over the last 100 years .
All presidents seem to have this idea that if they can just get it in the right direction , they can redirect the Queen Mary , ” she said , referring to the massive ocean liner .
A huge population of rare dolphins threatened by climate change and fishing nets has been discovered in South Asia .
Researchers with the Wildlife Conservation Society estimate that nearly 6,000 Irrawaddy dolphins , marine mammals that are related to orcas or killer whales , were found living in freshwater regions of Bangladesh ’s Sundarbans mangrove forest and adjacent waters of the Bay of Bengal .
There has been hardly any marine mammal research done in this area up to this point .
Each discovery of Irrawaddy dolphins is important because scientists do not know how many remain on the planet .
Prior to this study , the largest known populations of Irrawaddy dolphins numbered in the low hundreds or less .
In 2008 , they were listed as vulnerable in the IUCN Red List based on population declines in known dolphin populations .
" This discovery gives us great hope that there is a future for Irrawaddy dolphins , " said Brian D. Smith , lead author of a study describing the discovery .
“ Bangladesh clearly serves as an important sanctuary for Irrawaddy dolphins , and conservation in this region should be a top priority . ”
The study 's findings were announced today at the First International Conference on Marine Mammal Protected Areas in Maui , Hawaii , and are detailed in the winter issue of the Journal of Cetacean Research and Management .
Despite finding this extraordinarily large population , the study ’s authors warn that the dolphins are becoming increasingly threatened by accidental entanglement in fishing nets .
During the study , researchers encountered two dolphins that had become entangled and subsequently drowned in fishing nets — a common occurrence according to local fishermen .
In another study , detailed in the March / April issue of the journal Aquatic Conservation : Marine and Freshwater Ecosystem , Smith and his coauthors report the additional long - term threat to the dolphin population of declining freshwater supplies , caused by upstream water diversion in India , coupled with sea - level rise due to climate change .
These circumstances also threaten Ganges River dolphins , an endangered species with a range that overlaps with that of the Irrawaddy dolphins in the Sundarbans mangrove forest .
Yangtze River dolphin , or baiji , are a type of freshwater dolphin thought to be extinct due to the impact of humans .
The Irrawaddy dolphin grows to some 6.5 to 8 feet ( 2 to 2.5 meters ) in length and frequents large rivers , estuaries , and freshwater lagoons in South and Southeast Asia .
In Myanmar ’s Ayeyarwady River , these dolphins are known for “ cooperative fishing ” with humans , where the animals voluntarily herd schools of fish toward fishing boats and awaiting nets .
With the aid of dolphins , fishermen can increase the size of their catches up to threefold .
The dolphins appear to benefit from this relationship by easily preying on the cornered fish and those that fall out of the net as the fishermen pull it from the water .
In 2006 , WCS helped establish a protected area along the Ayeyarwady River to conserve this critically endangered mammal population .
The WCS is working on establishing a similar protected area network for both Irrawaddy and Ganges River dolphins in the Sundarbans mangrove forest .
Funding for the new study was provided in part by the Kerzner Marine Foundation and Ocean Park Conservation Foundation , Hong Kong ( OPCFHK ) , and the U.S. Marine Mammal Commission .

Video : Making a monopole
Theory predicts that monopole particles should exist ; and now we may have found them ( Image : Steve Bronstein / Riser / Getty )
THEY seem magical : magnets , every child ’s favourite science toy .
Two otherwise ordinary lumps of metal draw inexorably closer , finally locking together with a satisfying snap .
Yet turn one of them round and they show an entirely different , repulsive face : try as you might to make them , never the twain shall meet .
If magnets seem rather bipolar , that ’s because they are .
Every magnet has two poles , a north and a south .
Like poles repel , unlike poles attract .
No magnet breaks the two - pole rule – not the humblest bar magnet , not the huge dynamo at the heart of our planet .
Split a magnet in two , and each half sprouts the pole it lost .
It seems that poles without their twins – magnetic “ monopoles ” – simply do not exist .
That has n’t stopped physicists hunting .
For decades they have ransacked everything from moon rock and cosmic rays to ocean - floor sludge to find them .
There is a simple reason for this quixotic quest .
Our best explanations of how the universe hangs together demand that magnetic monopoles exist .
If they are not plain to see , they must be hiding .
Now , at last , we have might have spied them out .
The first convincing evidence for their existence has popped up in an unexpected quarter .
They are not exactly the monopoles of physics lore , but they could provide us with essential clues as to how those legendary beasts behave .
“ These might not be the monopoles of physics lore – but they could provide the first clues as to how those legendary beasts behave ” …
Ubuntu Linux root Password – Find default root user password
ADVERTISEMENTS
Ubuntu Linux and root account password
I have just installed Ubuntu Linux .
But , what is the default root password for Ubuntu ?
I can only login as a normal user .
How do I login as root user on Ubuntu Linux ?
It is the mystery for most Ubuntu Linux users .
You did n’t set a root password , so what is it ?
The root user ( also known as superuser ) , is a user on Ubuntu Linux and Unix - like systems with full administrative privileges ( full access ) .
So using the root account for daily work can be very dangerous , and you may damage your working system .
By default root account is locked under Ubuntu Linux .
Therefore , you cannot log in as root or use ‘ su -‘ command to become a superuser .
To run all administrative command use the sudo command on Ubuntu .
sudo allows a permitted user to execute a command as the superuser or another user .
Ubuntu setup your default account ( the one created during installation ) to run all administrative commands .
For example create a new user called bar , you need to type sudo command as follows :
$ sudo adduser bar
Password :
When sudo asks for a password , you need to supply YOUR OWN password .
In other words a root password is not needed .
Here are few more examples .
Start / stop / restart services stored in /etc / init.d/ directory
$ sudo /etc / init.d/ssh stop
$ sudo /etc / init.d/ networking restart
$ sudo systemctl restart ssh
Avoid typing sudo each and every time on Ubuntu Linux
Note that this is not recommended until and unless you are an expert and aware of what you are typing or doing :
$ sudo -i
OR
$ sudo -s
Above command will start / bin / bash as a root shell so that you can enter a root user command without using sudo command .
Open the terminal application and simply type the following sudo command $ sudo bash
OR
$ sudo -s
Supply your password and you will become a root user .
So , what is the default root password for Ubuntu Linux ?
Short answer – none .
The root account is locked in Ubuntu Linux .
There is no Ubuntu Linux root password set by default and you do n’t need one .
Long answer from the official wiki page :
By default , the root account password is locked in Ubuntu .
This means that you cannot login as root directly or use the su command to become the root user .
However , since the root account physically exists it is still possible to run programs with root - level privileges .
This is where sudo comes in – it allows authorized users to run certain programs as root without having to know the root password .
This means that in the terminal you should use sudo for commands that require root privileges ; simply prepend sudo to all the commands you need to run as root .
The landlady of a British pub has exploited a loophole in the country 's smoking ban by opening a " smoking research centre " where drinkers can light up legally , reports said Wednesday .
Locals at the Cutting Edge pub in Barnsley , northern England , must fill in a questionnaire on their smoking habits to satisfy legal requirements before sitting down for a drink and a cigarette in the centre .
England and Wales introduced a ban on smoking in enclosed public places in 2007 , contributing to tumbling beer sales which have forced over 2,000 pubs to close in the last year , according to the British Beer And Pub Association .
The Cutting Edge 's landlady Kerry Fenton opened the centre , which is a separate room in her pub , five days ago .
" It 's given business a shot in the arm and it's all in the name of research , legal and above board , " she told the Sun newspaper .
" I 'm a non -smoker but I believe in the freedom of the individual . "
The loophole in the law was discovered by pub regular James Martin , a 40 - year - old printer .
The local council told the paper it intended to enforce the smoking ban at the pub .

After a two - day approach to rendezvous with the Hubble Space Telescope , the space shuttle Atlantis has captured the probe and stowed it safely in its payload bay .
Astronauts will begin the first of five full days of spacewalks on Thursday to refurbish the probe and extend its life until at least 2014 ( Image : NASA )
After seven years of floating alone in space , the Hubble Space Telescope has found a temporary home aboard the space shuttle Atlantis .
Hubble is now secured on a platform in the shuttle ’s payload bay , where astronauts will work for five consecutive days to refurbish the telescope and extend its life until at least 2014 .
From a perch high above western Australia , astronaut Megan McArthur used the shuttle ’s 15 - metre- long robotic arm to grab Hubble on Wednesday .
As the captured telescope came into view of astronauts in the shuttle , lead spacewalker John Grunsfeld , who has visited the telescope on two previous shuttle missions , sent the first dispatch on the condition of the telescope to mission control : “ I ’m just looking out the window here , and it ’s an unbelievably beautiful sight .
Amazingly , the exterior of Hubble , an old man of 19 years in space , still looks in fantastic shape . ”

Delicate manoeuvres
It has been more than seven years since a shuttle visited Hubble , and this 11 - day shuttle mission will be the last to service the iconic telescope .
Over the course of five spacewalks , astronauts will install six new gyroscopes to help the telescope stabilise itself , six new batteries , two new science instruments and will repair two others ( see Pimp my scope : Revamping Hubble ) .
To reach Hubble , shuttle commander Scott Altman manually piloted the craft from a seat in the rear of the flight deck overlooking the payload bay .
Since Hubble could not actively communicate its position to the shuttle , mission specialist Michael Good measured the closing distance by aiming a hand - held laser range - finder through the shuttle windows .
Once the shuttle was within reach , astronauts used the shuttle ’s robotic arm to grab the 11 - tonne telescope Hubble and place it on a platform at the rear of the shuttle ’s payload bay .
Hubble is secured by three latches to the platform , on a ring that can be rotated 360 degrees to allow astronauts full access to all sides of the telescope .
Planning for the end
The first of the five spacewalks will begin on Thursday , when Grunsfeld and Andrew Feustel will remove Hubble ’s 15 - year - old Wide Field and Planetary Camera 2 and install a $ 132 million , 400 - kg ( 900 - lb ) replacement , called Wide Field Camera 3 .
The astronauts will also replace a unit that relays commands and images to and from the telescope ’s instruments .
Hubble ’s router , which has been flying since the probe was launched in 1994 , experienced a glitch last year that incapacitated one of its two equivalent sides .
The shuttle launch was postponed for six months in order to prepare a replacement .
On Thursday , astronauts will also install a new grapple fixture , which could be used by a future vehicle to grab onto Hubble and hurl it towards Earth to burn up in the atmosphere at the end of its life .
George Mellor runs a Providence computer company that does a lot of business with the network equipment maker Cisco Systems Inc .
He made the trip to Boston this week to learn what Cisco planned to do to help support companies like his in the coming year .
Among the Cisco representatives on hand was Andrew Sage , who flew in from the company 's headquarters in California to talk up its new small - business initiatives , and Paul Bosco , who was on hand to promote software and hardware products developed at Cisco 's New England Development Center in Boxborough .
All three joined the roughly 1,500 technology pros who descended on the Boston Convention and Exhibition Center yesterday morning for the networking giant 's annual Partner Summit .
This year , the three - day event , the first held in Boston , is serving a dual purpose for the San Jose company : enhancing relationships with its " partners , " the businesses from 93 countries that resell Cisco products and promoting the research at its Boxborough development center , which employs 1,700 workers on a campus off Interstate 495 .
Cisco 's presence in the Boston tech community has been overshadowed by high - profile local research outposts for Google Inc. , Microsoft Corp. , and International Business Machines Corp. , but Bosco , the Development Center 's general manager and site executive , is promising to " take the story up a notch .
We want to engage more aggressively with New England entrepreneurs , venture capitalists , and universities . "
Over the past 15 years , Cisco , best known for its routers and switches - the " plumbing of the Internet , " has acquired 15 New England companies for a total investment of $ 11 billion .
And the Boxborough campus is the company 's third largest in the United States , after the San Jose headquarters and a location in Raleigh , N.C .
The company also has smaller facilities in Boston , Burlington , and Portsmouth , N.H .
Cisco products are primarily sold through a global network of companies , large and small , that resell and service its technology .
Fully 80 percent of Cisco 's revenue comes from these partners ( a much smaller percentage comes from direct sales of consumer products like Linksys home networking products and the trendy Flip video cameras ) .
Cisco partners include AT&T Inc. , British Telecommunication PLC , and Verizon .
On the other end of the scale are small technology companies like Providence - based CBE Technologies LLC , which installs communication networks for organizations such as the Boston Public Library .
" It 's important for us to be here to find out what Cisco 's latest thinking is in terms of direction , new technologies , " said CBE chief executive George Mellor as he emerged from an address yesterday by Cisco chief technology officer Padmasree Warrior .
And the latest , at least at this year 's conference ?
" We want to be leading the second wave of the Internet , " said Sage , Cisco 's vice president , worldwide channels .
" Data centers , which are the beating heart of the Internet , are a big part of that .
But so is video and collaboration , " meaning products to allow employees in different locations to work together .
Prominently on display at this year 's show : " Tele Presence " technology that Cisco is hoping will make videoconferencing easier to use and more accessible to small and mid-sized businesses .
Two demonstration areas in a " collaboration lounge " allowed partners to try Cisco TelePresence systems - one priced at $ 32,000 , another at $ 85,000 .
Roger L. Kay , a technology market analyst and the president of Endpoint Technologies Associates Inc. , is not surprised that Cisco is promoting videoconferencing .
" Visual and video communication is driving a lot of growth " on the Internet , he said .
" Cisco can leverage itself into new markets by helping its partners get into new businesses like videoconferencing . "
Another Cisco initiative promoted at the conference was a " unified computing " approach to data centers , which Cisco promises will combine networking , computing , and storage into one cohesive system of components controlled by the company 's products .
Significantly , the initiative includes a technology from Cisco's New England Development Center that enables the linking of different computers and software platforms , and a strategic alliance with storage company EMC Corp. in Hopkinton .
Bosco likes the way this could play out for the region .
" It looks like New England is developing into a combination of where Cisco is strong , and where it wants to be , " he said .
" That 's a good sign . "

" The Fed is going to have to consider doubling its purchases of Treasuries , " said Ashraf Laidi , from CMC Capital Markets .
" We could be nearing the end - game for the US dollar but the Fed has little choice at this point .
We 're in a vicious circle where any policy aimed at supporting the US economy must be at the expense of the dollar . "
Rock Band players who want the full experience for the next installment of the game had better get saving now .
If you want John , Paul , George and Ringo , you ’ll need Benjamin , Benjamin , Benjamin and Benjamin – and Ulysses Grant in the Yoko role .
The game by itself will cost $ 59 , but it ’s now been revealed that the $ 249 special edition with customized instruments will include replicas of Paul McCartney ’s Hofner bass and Ringo Starr ’s Ludwig drum set , plus a generic microphone .
( The game will allow up to three microphones to be used for harmonies . )
Guitars based on John Lennon ’s Rickenbacker 325 and George Harrison ’s Gretsch Duo Jet will only be available to purchase individually at $ 99 each .
( TG Daily notes that the real things would cost you around $ 2,500 to $ 3,000 each . )
They ’ll also be compatible with all other games in the Rock Band series .
The game is due for release on 9 September and will also serve as part of a marketing blitz for a series of remastered CD releases of Beatles Albums .
It will follow the basic concept of other Rock Bands , but is being billed as a completely standalone game with “ gameplay that takes players on a journey through the legacy and evolution of the band ’s legendary career . ”
The project has included involvement from Giles Martin , the man behind the remixed music of the Love album and stageshow .

Walkthrough - Judges of the Underworld - Back up the Chain
MADISON -- Early diagnosis and treatment of Alzheimer 's disease could save millions or even billions of dollars while simultaneously improving care , according to new work by University of Wisconsin - Madison researchers .
Patients with Alzheimer 's disease and other dementias are heavy users of long - term care services , especially nursing home care , with estimated annual costs upward of tens of billions of dollars nationwide .
Much of the fiscal burden is borne by state and federal governments -- and thus taxpayers -- through the Medicaid and Medicare programs .
For example , the Wisconsin Medicaid program spends almost half a billion dollars each year on nursing home care for just 11,000 dementia patients -- a tiny fraction of the estimated 160,000 affected people in the state , says Mark Sager , director of the Wisconsin Alzheimer 's Institute of the UW - Madison School of Medicine and Public Health .
These costs could be greatly reduced by earlier diagnosis and treatment , he says in a new study co-authored by La Follette School of Public Affairs professor David Weimer .
The research , a cost - benefit analysis of the social and fiscal impacts of early identification and treatment of Alzheimer 's disease , using Wisconsin as a model , appears in the May issue of Alzheimer 's & Dementia : The Journal of the Alzheimer 's Association .
" The future of this disease is to intervene decades before someone becomes symptomatic .
This analysis says you can save literally billions of dollars in long - term care costs if you can intervene at an earlier stage , " Sager says .
" What you do n't know costs a lot of money when it comes to this disease . "
The issue is becoming more pressing as the population ages , with some estimates placing the incidence of Alzheimer 's disease in the U.S. around 1 million cases by 2050 , the authors say .
" We need to begin now to make the public - policy changes that will allow and encourage early recognition and intervention , " says Sager .
" This article says to all the legislators facing deficits , ' here 's a way to save money , and you can do it by providing better care . '
It 's a win for legislators , it 's a win for patients , it 's a win for families . "
The analysis considers two types of interventions following diagnosis : patient drug treatment and caregiver - support programs .
Each would provide positive net savings , with the greatest benefits achieved using a combination of both .
" Even just with currently available drug treatments , [ early diagnosis ] seems to offer positive social benefits .
If we had a stronger caregiver - support network , it could be even greater , " Weimer says .
They predict even larger benefits if more effective drug treatments are developed and if public policy supported caregiver benefits , such as counseling and support groups .
Currently , Medicare does not support caregiver - intervention programs .
Even accounting for implementation costs , the new analysis suggests that they would result in net savings to governments by reducing the care burden on medical systems .
" It does take some investment early on , and of course this is a time when all state dollars are tight .
But from the long - run perspective , it looks like it's a clear winner , " says Weimer .
In addition to substantial financial savings -- on average $ 10,000 net savings to the state alone per patient diagnosed in Wisconsin -- their analysis showed that early identification and intervention would lead to positive social outcomes , including slower disease progression and improved quality of life for the patients ' families and caregivers .
These combined social benefits would total around $ 100,000 for the typical patient , Weimer says , and could climb to five times that with the development of drugs that could stop disease progression .
A major challenge to reaping these potential savings is the current lack of mechanisms for screening and early diagnosis , allowing the vast majority of affected people to go unrecognized , Sager says .
" We will have to develop systems of cognitive screening if we are going to eventually identify people at early stages when future medications and caregiver interventions are most likely to be helpful . "
" There are many physical , emotional and social benefits of early detection , diagnosis and intervention for people with Alzheimer 's and their caregivers , " says Shelley Morrison Bluethmann , director of early stage initiatives at the Alzheimer 's Association , a health advocacy organization .
" Early detection empowers people with the disease to participate in decisions about their treatment and future care , as well as consider clinical trial opportunities .
Being diagnosed early is vital to receiving the best help and care possible . "

LONDON ( Reuters ) - Manufacturers have taken the first preparatory steps in developing a vaccine against a new strain of flu that has killed up to 149 people in Mexico and threatens to become a pandemic .

World governments and businesses announced new steps on Tuesday to try to slow the spread of a new strain of swine flu that has killed up to 149 people in Mexico and threatens to become a pandemic .
The World Health Organisation has raised its alert level to phase 4 , indicating a significantly increased risk of pandemic .
Global markets tumbled for a second day on Tuesday on fears the outbreak could snuff out fragile signs of economic recovery .

But the World Health Organization ( WHO ) said it would only call for large - scale production of such a pandemic vaccine if it strongly believed the world was on the edge of an unstoppable global outbreak of flu .
Switzerland ’s Novartis AG said on Tuesday it had received the genetic code of the new virus strain , enabling it to start work on evaluating production , and it hoped to receive the actual virus in its laboratories “ in the near future . ”
Still , it is likely to take between five and six months before a vaccine is commercially available , according to the
WHO .
The delay is not for want of trying .
The U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has already taken a sample of the H1N1 virus causing the disease , produced a vaccine virus strain and is growing it up , marking the first stage of the production process .
These samples , which can then be distributed to companies , must be grown in specially produced chicken eggs in a cumbersome system that experts agree is outdated .
New and more efficient technologies based on cell cultures are , however , still a few years away .
While the race is on to prepare a pandemic vaccine , health authorities and companies still have to make the tricky decision of when , or indeed whether , to switch capacity from producing seasonal vaccines to making the new shot .
“ If you go to pandemic flu production , people wo n’t get normal flu shots -- it is a huge consideration , ” said WHO spokesman Gregory Hartl .
At least 20 companies , in addition to Novartis , make flu vaccines , including Sanofi- Aventis , GlaxoSmithKline , Baxter International , Australia ’s CSL and nasal spray maker MedImmune , now part of AstraZeneca .
They are currently geared to producing season flu shots , which vaccine specialists say will not stop the new form of swine flu spreading around the world , although people who have been immunized may end up with milder symptoms .
So - called swine flu is a variant of the H1N1 form of the human influenza virus , but tests show the H1N1 component of the current seasonal flu vaccine does not protect against the new strain .
A big challenge facing manufacturers will be making sufficient quantities of vaccine from a limited supply of active ingredient , or antigen .
One option to extend supply is to use an additive , known as an adjuvant , to increase the body ’s immune response and reduce the amount of antigen needed in each shot .
Several companies are working on this approach .
Glaxo , in particular , said it believed its novel adjuvant technology could make a significant contribution to antigen sparing .
The British company previously developed a vaccine against the H5N1 strain of bird flu -- originally thought to pose the biggest pandemic threat -- using a special adjuvant that allowed an extremely low dose of active ingredient to be used .
Credit Suisse analysts said companies with the know - how to make pandemic flu vaccines stood to benefit from additional sales , adding there could also be an increase in seasonal flu vaccine demand as disease awareness increases .
The United Nations has called on Israel to end its programme of demolishing homes in East Jerusalem and tackle a mounting housing crisis for Palestinians in the city .
Dozens of Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem are demolished each year because they do not have planning permits .
Critics say the demolitions are part of an effort to extend Israeli control as Jewish settlements continue to expand .
The 21 - page report from the UN office for the co-ordination of humanitarian affairs is the latest round in an intensifying campaign on the issue .
Although Israel 's mayor of Jerusalem , Nir Barkat , has defended the planning policy as even - handed , the US secretary of state , Hillary Clinton , in March described demolitions as " unhelpful " .
An internal report for EU diplomats , released earlier and obtained by the Guardian , described them as illegal under international law and said they " fuel bitterness and extremism " .
Israel occupied East Jerusalem in the 1967 war and later unilaterally annexed it , a move not recognised by the international community .
The UN said that of the 70.5 sq km of East Jerusalem and the West Bank annexed by Israel , only 13 % was zoned for Palestinian construction and this was mostly already built up .
At the same time 35 % had been expropriated for Israeli settlements , even though all settlements on occupied land are illegal under international law .
As a result Palestinians in East Jerusalem had found it increasingly difficult to obtain planning permits and many had built without them , risking fines and eventual demolition , the UN said .
As many as 28 % of all Palestinian homes in East Jerusalem were built in violation of Israeli planning rules .
" Throughout its occupation , Israel has significantly restricted Palestinian development in East Jerusalem , " the UN report said .
It said 673 Palestinian structures had been demolished in the east between 2000 and 2008 .
Last year alone 90 structures were demolished , leaving 400 Palestinians displaced , the highest number of demolitions for four years .
Similar demolitions are carried out regularly by the Israeli military across the West Bank .
The UN said it was particularly concerned about areas facing mass demolition , including Bustan in Silwan , just south of the old city , where the threatened destruction of 90 houses would lead to the displacement of 1,000 Palestinians .
Families who lose their homes are faced with the choice of moving into crowded apartments with relatives or renting new homes .
They face " significant hardships " , including having their property destroyed and struggling with debts from fines and legal fees , the UN said .
A 2007 survey , quoted in the UN report , found that more than half of the displaced families took at least two years to find a new permanent home and often moved several times in the process .
Children missed out on school and suffered emotional and behavioural problems for months , with poor academic records over the longer term .
The authorities in Jerusalem challenged the UN report and denied " the accusations and numbers throughout " .
Israel 's Jerusalem municipality accepted there was a " planning crisis " but said it was " not just in eastern Jerusalem but throughout all of Jerusalem that affects Jews , Christians and Muslims alike " .
It said the mayor would present a new plan for the city .
" Recent events indicate that the Jerusalem municipality will maintain , and possibly accelerate , its policy on house demolition , " the UN report said .
" Israel should immediately freeze all pending demolition orders and undertake planning that will address the Palestinian housing crisis in East Jerusalem . "
Last week , Barkat , who won election five months ago , rejected international criticism of demolitions and planning policy as " misinformation " and " Palestinian spin .
There is no politics .
It 's just maintaining law and order in the city , " he said .
" The world is basing its evidence on the wrong facts .
The world has to learn and I am sure people will change their minds . "
Barkat said he wanted to improve the life of all the city 's residents , Jewish and Arab , but that he was committed to maintaining a Jewish majority .
Jews make up around two - thirds of the city 's population .
The UN said nearly a third of East Jerusalem remained unplanned , meaning there could be no construction .
Even in planned areas there were problems , including the number of small privately held plots , poor infrastructure and few resources .
Although the number of permit applications more than doubled between 2003 and 2007 , the number of permits grants remained relatively flat , the UN said .
There was a gap between housing needs and permitted construction of 1,100 housing units a year .
" Due to the lack of proper urban planning , the under - investment in public infrastructure and the inequitable allocation of budgetary resources , East Jerusalem is overcrowded and the public services do not meet the needs of the Palestinian population , " the report said .

Days before she was to be sentenced for one of the country 's most egregious environmental crimes , North Andover resident Albania Deleon begged for the court 's mercy .
" I pray that God will forgive my soul , " she wrote in a three - page handwritten letter to US District Court Judge Nathaniel M. Gorton , " and allow me to atone the rest of my life repaying and repairing the harm I have done .
This is my solemn promise . "
Then the 39 - year - old mother sawed off her ankle monitor and disappeared into a cool March day , becoming one of the US Environmental Protection Agency 's most wanted fugitives .
Deleon left behind not only her 3 - year - old son , but hundreds , maybe thousands , of people who face a heightened risk of lung cancer because of her crimes .
Deleon operated New England 's largest asbestos removal training school out of an attractive downtown Methuen storefront from 2001 to 2007 .
But training was a misnomer : Instead , Deleon and her assistants would often simply sell , for $ 400 , certificates saying the holder was qualified to remove insulation , flooring , and other construction material containing deadly asbestos fibers .
Federal officials estimate at least 2,500 people received fraudulent certificates from Deleon .
Those people - most illegal immigrants , according to federal officials - then went in to hundreds of schools , hospitals , churches , libraries , and homes throughout New England to remove asbestos .
Most of them lacked training in even the most basic safety precautions .
Officials believe the heath risks to people in those buildings - from Beverly High School students to Roslindale Public Library patrons - are minimal ; most were not directly exposed to the asbestos - laced dust kicked up in the removal process .
But there is deep concern that the workers , most of them young men from Central America , breathed the fibers , which can lodge in the lungs and lead to death decades later .
Many of those workers , it turned out , had never even been told how to properly wear a respirator .
Equally troubling is that they may have exposed their families to the cancer risk .
Asbestos workers , if not properly trained , can inadvertently carry the fibers home on their clothes or hair .
" The scope of this is enormous , " said Michael Hubbard , special agent in charge of the EPA 's Criminal Investigation Division in New England , whose office arrested Deleon in 2007 .
" And the biggest victims in this entire house of greed are the illegal aliens who did not receive training and were placed in very hazardous working conditions - many did not know what they were dealing with . "

President Obama has several half - siblings by his father
Barack Obama 's half - brother was denied entry to the UK after being accused of a serious crime on an earlier visit , the Home Office has confirmed .
Samson Obama , who lives in Kenya , was on his way to the US presidential inauguration in January when he was stopped at East Midlands Airport .
According to the News of the World , fingerprint tests linked him to an alleged sex attack on a British girl .
He was questioned but not charged over the incident in Berkshire , it added .
' Public good '
A Home Office spokesman said Samson Obama was denied a visa after immigration officers noticed one of his documents was false .
That led them to further inquiries .
Samson Obama , who runs a mobile phone shop outside Nairobi , had been planning to make a short break in the UK on his way to Washington .
He eventually took a connecting flight to the US without formally entering the UK .
A UK Border Agency spokesman said in general , Britain would oppose the entry of individuals where their presence was " not conducive to the public good " .
Samson Obama is one of several half - siblings of the US president .
Barack Obama
Sr left his son when he was two years old and lived most of his life in Kenya , where he fathered a number of other sons and a daughter with three other wives .
He died in a car crash in 1982 .
Bill Fraley knelt to examine the brown , pebbled soil , like an art professor studying a familiar drawing .
“ See those two fine - lines ? ” he said , passing a finger over two shoe prints , each with washboard rows of ridges .
His hand moved to another heel print a few inches away .
“ And there ’s a doper lug , ” the heel imprint of a boot sometimes worn by drug smugglers .
A few steps away , a 5 - foot barbed - wire fence cut through the cactus and greasewood , separating the United States from Mexico .
The Border Patrol agent stood and tipped back the brim of his Stratton cowboy hat , eyes hidden behind aviator sunglasses .
A satisfied expression hung on his chiseled face .
There were at least three of them , he figured .
“ It rained all day yesterday and these signs are on top of the rain , ” he said .
“ So I ’d say they crossed yesterday , between 6 and 7 .
And it looks like they ’ve got heavy loads of dope on them . ”
Their drop point would probably be on Interstate 10 , near the exit for Steins Ghost Town and the New Mexico - Arizona state line .
To get there , they would have to traverse 75 miles of rocky mountain ranges and tumbleweed - choked valleys , avoiding rattlesnakes and federal agents -- and do it on foot , with 45 pounds of marijuana on each of their backs .
It would take five to seven days .
Unless the Border Patrol caught them first .
Drug cartels in Mexico are in a deadly battle over smuggling routes into the United States .
At the same time , more border agents , hundreds of miles of new fencing and a growing arsenal of high - tech devices have made it harder than ever for drug traffickers to cross much of the 2,000 - mile border with Mexico .
Over the last six months , the U.S. Border Patrol has seized 1.3 million pounds of marijuana -- an amount nearly equal to the total for all of last year .
The crackdown has driven waves of ever more daring smugglers to the most remote and rugged parts of the border , areas that are difficult for federal agents to patrol , where fancy electronic surveillance is often useless .
The southwestern corner of New Mexico , with its 81 miles of border , is one of those prime corridors , a forbidding area the size of Los Angeles County where drug traffickers find plenty of places to hide .
To outwit their adversaries , Border Patrol agents here rely on tracking skills borrowed a century ago from Native Americans : “ cutting for sign , ” detecting where someone has crossed the Earth ’s surface , and “ pushing sign , ” tracking that person down .
So far this year , Border Patrol agents in this area have hauled in 35,500 pounds of marijuana , more than all of the year before , with a street value of nearly $ 30 million .
Radar units , infrared scopes and other technological marvels “ are damn good machines , ” said Eddie Parra , a supervisor in the Lordsburg Border Patrol station .
“ But they ca n’t see everything here .
It ’s still up to us . ”
Tuesday , 10 a.m .
Fraley cut the sign a mile from the nearest dirt road .
He got on his radio to relay the details to other agents , who work as a team , in four overlapping shifts , 24 hours a day .
To Fraley , 50 , sign - cutting is both art and science .
He looks for footprints , though he usually finds just fragments .
He looks for disturbances : turned - over rocks , broken twigs , bent barbed wire .
He looks for chewed gum , a cigarette butt , the residue of a line of cocaine snorted on a rock .
He looks for clues to fix the time : Prints that seem to run right into a tree , for example , were made before the moon rose .
It is , Fraley explained , “ the ultimate hunt .
They may not be able to read and write their name , but they are very , very good at what they do . ”
On this morning , the smugglers had left behind plenty of evidence .
They had knocked over rocks and Fraley and Parra noticed that the soil beneath was slightly dark and still moist .
“ What I really love , ” Fraley said , “ is when you come across an ant pile that ’s been stepped in .
Ants will rebuild an anthill in an hour , so if you see a footprint in an anthill you ’d better look up -- because you ’re likely to be looking right at your adversaries . ”
Drug smugglers are nocturnal creatures .
They spend their days hunkered down in the latticework of rock caves in mountains on the Continental Divide , crossing the valleys and open countryside by night .
Fraley ’s calculation :
If the smugglers crossed the border at dusk , they had traveled much of the night .
That likely put them near Red Hill , 15 miles north in the Animas Mountains .
A Mobile Surveillance System had been positioned on that route the night before .
The tall , rotating radar device , operated day and night by an agent under camouflage netting , is the latest in crime - fighting technology .
But it ca n’t see into the deep gullies that slice down the mountainside , and it had n’t picked up any movement .
This group , Parra and Fraley agreed , would probably spend tonight moving through the Animas Mountains , which appeared in the distance , bathed in the blue shadows of puffy clouds .
Tracking them through that terrain at night would be impossible .
But eventually , the smugglers would have to drop down into the valley and cross westward to the Peloncillo Mountains .
That ’s when the Border Patrol would have its best chance to catch them .
Wednesday , 1 p.m .
Parra ’s radio crackled with good news .
Seismic sensors in the Animas Mountains had recorded movement overnight , and that morning , agents on horseback had picked up the sign .
It was the same group .
He steered his SUV along County Road 1 , which runs through the long valley between the Animas and Peloncillo ranges .
Thick whiskers of wild grass , toasted gold , stretched for miles on either side of the road .
To the right , a twisting column of tumbleweeds rose 40 feet in the sky like a translucent tornado .
To the left , a cloudburst showered a distant peak in indigo streaks .
Sign - cutting is Parra ’s passion .
“ God blessed me with the skill , ” he said .
A Border Patrol agent ’s life can be lonely .
Some patrol hundreds of miles a day in SUVs , a two - way radio their only companion .
Others venture forth in pairs , on foot , on horseback or in all - terrain vehicles .
After dark , when the few ranchers around here park their pickups , the roads belong to the Border Patrol .
“ Any car you pass down here at night is either lost or pretending to be lost , ” Parra said .
About 3 p.m. , Parra , 43 , pulled to a stop and met up with the horse patrol unit leader , Lawrence “ Junior ” Helbig .
Helbig and his partner had spent much of the day tracking the footprints .
“ It ’s the same group , ” Helbig said .
“ The odds of having several fine - lines and a doper lug together are just too high . ”
Fraley had confirmed three sets of footprints ; now Helbig had spotted two more .
A late - morning shower had mucked up the trail , but the color of the soil in the prints suggested they were only about four hours old , he said .
It was n’t so long ago that the Lordsburg force numbered barely a dozen agents ; today it has 200 , with plans for 350 in two years .
The United States plans similar buildups all along the border amid fears that the violence in Mexico will spill over here .
Helbig knows it ’s still not enough to stop the waves of smugglers .
“ It ’s like stopping the flow of water in a river , ” Helbig said .
“ You can throw a rock in it , but the water always goes around . ”
Two weeks earlier , Helbig had tracked five smugglers into a nearby thicket .
The smugglers jumped out and “ quailed , ” running in all directions .
Agents caught them and found several hundred pounds of marijuana as well as an AK - 47 rifle .
One of the smugglers said the weapon was for protection -- from other drug smugglers .
“ Thank goodness they ’re not real violent toward us yet , ” Helbig said .
“ But there ’s a reason we carry a sidearm . ”
Wednesday , 8:15 p.m .
Parra , tired after a 14 - hour day , headed home to Lordsburg .
Jose Portillo , 36 , the night supervisor , set a trap .
He assigned two agents to hide on one side of County Road 1 .
Using thermal imaging binoculars , they would try to pick up the smugglers as they descended into the valley .
Then they would radio another two - man unit , this one armed with M - 4 rifles .
If all went according to plan , the smugglers would never make it across County Road 1 .
Portillo drove his SUV , headlights off , toward the stakeout .
He wanted to be close when the trap was sprung .
Jack rabbits bounced across the road .
Taking care not to illuminate the brake lights , he coasted to a stop .
The engine was idling , heater on .
A gauge showed the outside temperature at 50 degrees , a 20 - degree drop from a few hours before .
The moon crested the eastern horizon , casting light on the 8,500 - foot Animas Peak .
At 9:15 p.m. , Portillo checked in with his two teams .
Nothing .
“ Tonight is the night to catch them , ” Portillo said , gazing out his windshield , Orion shimmering in the sky .
“ It ’s harder after this . ”
At 1:46 a.m. , Portillo reached for the radio handset .
“ Let ’s pull out , ” he told his surveillance units .
He did n’t try to hide his disappointment .
“ They ’ve crossed by now , ” he said .
“ They must have taken a different route . ”
Pause .
“ Tomorrow , it ’s do or die . ”
Thursday , 10 a.m .
Parra read the overnight report :
The smugglers had crossed County Road 1 several miles from the stakeout , and made it to the Peloncillo Mountains .
Rogelio Villa and his partner , on foot in the Peloncillo range , picked up the sign .
“ We ’ve got our guys over here , ” Villa radioed Parra .
“ They were definitely here late last night or early this morning .
Looks like there are four or five of them . ”
The footprints were different , but Parra was n’t worried .
Smugglers often swap out their boots .
“ It ’s likely these are the same guys , ” he said .
Traffickers know that footprints can give them away .
So they walk on rocks , where they do n’t leave prints .
They walk backward .
They wear boots like those worn by Border Patrol agents .
They tie strips of carpet to their soles to avoid leaving clear prints on dirt roads .
( “ I ’ve even seen them take the hoofs from cattle and glue them to their shoes , ” one agent said . )
Two agents jumped ahead to see how far the smugglers had gotten .
At a cattle watering tank , they came upon a rancher ’s motion - activated game camera .
An agent took the memory card out of the camera and put it in his own .
The photo that popped up was clear : a muscular , dark - haired man with a short beard , wearing black jeans and a sweat shirt under his striped shirt .
A water bottle in his hand had been shrouded in black cloth , to avoid a reflection that might give his position away .
On his back was a parcel , about 3 feet square .
Marijuana .
As Parra knew , nearly identical parcels from an earlier bust , each weighing more than 45 pounds , were stacked in a drug locker at Border Patrol headquarters .
Parra called in air support .
Fifteen minutes later , a low hum signaled the arrival of a single - engine plane , which made long , sweeping runs over the mountain range .
“ We do n’t see anything , ” the pilot radioed .
“ We ’ve probably dug them in like a tick .
You might walk right up on them . ”
But Parra thought the smugglers might have moved farther north , across Highway 9 to the rocky hills of Weatherby Canyon .
If the traffickers had reached Weatherby , they would be one night ’s hike from drop points on Interstate 10 .
Villa found fresh footprints in the canyon , confirming Parra ’s suspicions .
“ These boys jumped Highway 9 already , ” Villa said .
“ They ’re up there on Weatherby . ”
Friday , noon
Two infrared scopes aimed at Weatherby Canyon had detected no movement the night before .
Parra returned to look for signs that the smugglers had come down the mountain .
Two younger agents searched for an hour and found nothing .
Within 10 minutes of arriving , though , Parra picked up the footprints .
He tracked the sign on foot for several miles along the side of Weatherby until it disappeared .
Sweat dripped from his face as he paused to take a swig from his water bottle .
“ I ’m leaning toward thinking they ’re still up on top of those hills , ” he said , lighting a Marlboro .
“ We were keeping this area very hot last night , and they could have stayed up . ”
Later , Parra reconsidered when a nearby rancher reported that his dogs had barked loudly at 3 a.m .
" I do n’t see how we would have missed them , ” he said .
“ But the dopers must have been moving . ”
Saturday morning
Tim Lowe , the day supervisor , dispatched two agents on ATVs to Weatherby .
A scope had been deployed there briefly the night before , “ but they 10 - 3ed it , ” Lowe said , using the code for terminating an operation .
No one had been able to pick up the sign again .
Sunday afternoon
The exit for Steins Ghost Town on Interstate 10 leads to a cemetery of weathered crosses .
Next to the cemetery , pieces of cloth and shoulder straps made of old blankets lay on the ground .
The drugs were gone , likely bound for Tucson and points west .
So were the smugglers , headed back to Mexico to collect their paychecks and pick up another load .
Back on the border , the day shift was out -- cutting for new sign .

KASHGAR , China 
A thousand years ago , the northern and southern branches of the Silk Road converged at this oasis town near the western edge of the Taklamakan Desert .
Traders from Delhi and Samarkand , wearied by frigid treks through the world ’s most daunting mountain ranges , unloaded their pack horses here and sold saffron and lutes along the city ’s cramped streets .
Chinese traders , their camels laden with silk and porcelain , did the same .
The traders are now joined by tourists exploring the donkey - cart alleys and mud-and - straw buildings once window - shopped , then sacked , by Tamerlane and Genghis Khan .
Now , Kashgar is about to be sacked again .
Nine hundred families already have been moved from Kashgar ’s Old City , “ the best - preserved example of a traditional Islamic city to be found anywhere in central Asia , ” as the architect and historian George Michell wrote in the 2008 book “ Kashgar : Oasis City on China ’s Old Silk Road . ”
Over the next few years , city officials say , they will demolish at least 85 percent of this warren of picturesque , if run -down homes and shops .
Many of its 13,000 families , Muslims from a Turkic ethnic group called the Uighurs ( pronounced WEE - gurs ) , will be moved .
Update :
In an emailed Q&A with MediaNama , Satish Jha , President of OLPC India said that the XO laptops will be provided to schools , upper primary at some places , primary at some others , and 9th grade at some .
These schools are mostly in the rural areas , and in some cases suburban areas .
Most of the orders have been placed by government bodies , and a small fraction by private institutions .
About connectivity , Jha said that connectivity will be managed locally – where schools can access broadband , they may be given limited Internet connectivity .
In case broadband is n’t possible , a mesh network and server based virtual net experience will be the likely environment .
The Price : For orders larger than 10,000 XOs , the price of the XO is Rs. 14,999 , inclusive of all taxes , and Rs. 11,000 excluding duties in case the buyer wishes to manage duties .
Content : one of our key concerns was about the content that will be made available with the XO – whether audio , video , or in local languages .
Jha said that the XO is being provided as the XO , with a couple dozen utilities and applications that come with it , and MS XP and Office to those who want it .
However , “ local content creation is a local responsibility , and the decision on content sourcing will have to be made by schools and the departments or governing bodies . ”
Responding to a question from one of our readers Shashikant Kore on why OLPC India has sought to partner with the government or corporates instead of making the XO available in the market , Jha said :
“ For a simple reason that making anything available as a retail item has its own costs and typically can run up to 45 % of the final price in India .
If we sell it through the channels , as we tried to understand it , XOs will sell for over rs 20,000 and that is not the price at which we can reach everyone .
We would like the price to be as low as possible and currently the total cost of production and delivery is at Rs 11,000 per XO for large orders of 10,000 and more .
At 100 pieces per order there is on an average an additional cost of about 15 % and that is another reason we encourage bulk purchases .
In any case it ’s a not for profit initiatives where costs equal price . ”
Original Story ( April 25 , 2009 ) : 250,000 , low priced , XO laptops could be making their way to India very soon , PC World reports .
that three organizations – two from the government and one from the private sector , have placed orders for distribution to around 1500 schools .
Satish Jha , President of OLPC India has said that the laptops will be distributed to children in suburban and rural areas starting June .
We ’ve contacted Satish Jha , President of OLPC India for more inputs .
This is the first set of low cost XO laptops ordered from India .
In an interview with MediaNama last year , Jha had said that in order to begin shipping to India , OLPC needed an order of at least 1 million XOs .
The cost of the XOs is expected to be $ 210 , and then there is , possibly , a government duty of 10.2 % on the import .
( Updated above )
It ’s likely that two state government organizations are involved – After having failed to convince the national government , OLPC had decided to approach state governments , particularly since education is a state subject .
OLPC India had set itself a target of 3 million XOs being shipped to the country in a year .
With seven months to go , they still need orders for another 2.75 million to meet that target ; 250,000 is a good start , though .
Content ?
( Updated above )
Is there adequate Indian language content – whether in text or audio- visual form – available for the XOs ?
I would be great if the Indian government , which also has the portal Sakshat , would make educational content available free on the net – in particular , free for redistribution under a creative commons non-commercial license .

Parents charged £ 400 ' stealth tax ' for sending children to faith schools as free buses are scrapped
Thousands of middle - income parents are being landed with bills of up to £ 400 a year to send their children to faith schools because councils are scrapping their historic right to free transport .
The charge has been condemned as a ' stealth tax ' on church schools that could put parents off applying for places .
Parents with large families face paying well over £ 1,000 a year to send their children to faith schools on the bus .
Not fare : Councils are axing discretionary free transport to faith schools to offset the costs of meeting their new legal obligations
Town halls have traditionally granted - many since the Second World War - an automatic right to free transport to faith schools as well as children 's nearest school , where it is too far to walk .
But now the Government has admitted that growing numbers are reducing the subsidy or scrapping it altogether - a trend hastened by its shake - up of school transport laws three years ago .
The reforms require councils to grant extra travel entitlements to poor families in a bid to extend their choice of schools .
But officials have admitted some town halls are cutting back on traditional free bus fares or mileage allowances which were meant to ensure all families can educate their children in line with their religious convictions .
Critics claim councils are axing discretionary free transport to faith schools - including Church of England , Roman Catholic , Jewish and Muslim - to offset the costs of meeting their new legal obligations .
It means only pupils on free school meals or whose parents claim the maximum level of working tax credit can claim free transport to faith schools , if the school is no more than 15 miles away .
In a written response to concerns raised by the Commons Transport Select Committee , officials from the Department for Children , Schools and Families said : ' We are aware that some local authorities have withdrawn discretionary denominational transport since the extended statutory duties came into force and DCSF has discussed this issue with faith groups . '
Controversial : A row has broken out in Nottingham over the decision to end free buses
Officials revealed that ' early indications ' suggest that nine out of 43 Church of England dioceses have seen a loss or reduction of subsidy in their areas or are likely to in the near future .
However officials said they plan to survey local authorities to ' establish precisely where they removed discretionary provisions ' .
The response highlights Essex County Council and Wolverhampton City Council for changing its policy on free fares .
A report produced by Wolverhampton outlining its new policy states that £ 64,000 was spent on providing free buses to faith schools in 2007 / 08 .
' Most of this expenditure will be saved by the new policy , ' it states .
Meanwhile a row has erupted in Nottingham where the city council has moved to end free buses for pupils who attend faith schools .
Parents would have to pay an annual fee of £ 250 for their school bus for primary pupils and £ 300 for secondary .
Edward Hayes , director of the Nottingham Diocese Education Service , said : ' We oppose the plans but we hope parents will still be prepared to pay for their transport and attend faith schools .
' The amount that they are proposing to save with these proposals is very small in terms of the whole schools ' budget . '
Other areas where parents are already having to pay at least part of the charge include Hampshire and Somerset .
Some parents in Northamptonshire report paying £ 400 for buses to faith schools .
Meanwhile in Herefordshire , non-Catholics attending a Roman Catholic school have had their transport assistance withdrawn .
Councils still have a duty to provide free transport to all pupils whose nearest school is outside walking distance .
Walking distances are designated as two miles for pupils aged up to eight , and three miles for those aged eight and over .
Councils only have to provide transport to children 's nearest school above these distances but traditionally also subsidised parents choosing church schools further away to avoid discriminating against those who preferred a faith education for their children .
New laws passed in 2006 require the poorest pupils to be given free transport to any one of their three nearest secondary schools within a six - mile radius of their home , and free transport to secondary faith schools up to 15 miles away .
A spokesman for the Church of England said it had warmly welcomed the new statutory entitlement to free transport to church schools for poorer pupils .
But he added : ' We are concerned that there is some evidence that LEAs are dispensing with offering free transport to church schools where it remains within their discretion to do so .
' We are particularly worried about the impact this will have on children from middle - income families who wish their child to attend a school that reflects their own religious background , but who may live some distance from such a school .
' No potential student should be put off from applying to a church school within a reasonable distance from their home , simply because their parents do n't have the means to transport them to and from school each day . '
A DCSF spokesman said : ' It is important that parents have the opportunity to choose a school or college in accordance with their religious convictions or belief and local authorities will be consulted on their future plans to provide discretionary transport . '

I read this Reuters Health article on MedlinePlus , and then I read the study the article referred to ( The impact of acupuncture on in vitro fertilization ) and now my head hurts .
The study found that acupuncture was not effective in increasing the pregnancy rate ( PR ) during in vitro fertilization ( IVF ) .
As quoted on MedlinePlus , the lead author , Alice Domar , seems to blame her patients ( the presumably poor quality of their embryos ) rather than acupuncture for the lack of success , and then she recommends using acupuncture even if it does n’t work .
That was bad enough , but “ poor quality embryos ” is a hypothesis that was actually tested and rejected in the study itself .
Has Domar forgotten ?
The headline of the MedlinePlus article says “ acupuncture does n’t boost IVF success for all ” – suggesting that it boosts success for some ?
Then the first sentence says the study suggested that acupuncture does n’t work , period .
But wait …
The lead researcher says acupuncture may not have worked in her study because , unlike past research , her investigation was n’t limited to women who had good quality embryos available for transfer .
“ I ’m wondering if my sample was just not a good sample , in that most of the patients in my study were probably not the best - prognosis patients , ”
Domar and her team say the most likely explanation for the lack of an acupuncture effect in their study was the fact that they included many women who did n’t have good quality embryos available for transfer .
While acupuncture may help a woman become pregnant after the transfer of a healthy embryo , the researcher noted in an interview , it ca n’t repair an embryo with chromosomal defects or other abnormalities .
Hold the boat !!
In the Discussion section of the paper itself , Domar et al point out that previous research has included mostly patients with good quality embryos .
They ask if perhaps acupuncture only works for good quality embryos ?
They test that hypothesis by separately analyzing the subjects in this study who had good quality embryos .
There was no increase in PR with acupuncture in this sub - group ; the results were the same as for the entire sample .
This study not only had an objective endpoint ( pregnancy ) but it also had several subjective psychological endpoints ( optimism , confidence , and anxiety as measured by perceived relaxation ) .
The women who received acupuncture felt more relaxed and enjoyed the IVF procedure more , the researchers found .
They were also more optimistic about getting pregnant , but not more confident that they would get pregnant . ”
Despite the results of my own study , I still recommend acupuncture to women going through IVF because there ’s no downside , ” Domar added , aside from the $ 150 an acupuncturist would typically charge — a small fraction of the $ 12,000 to $ 14,000 couples typically spent on a single round of IVF .
It seems to me this translates as : Acupuncture works .
It did n’t work in this study , but that ca n’t be the fault of acupuncture , because acupuncture works .
So it must be the fault of the patients for producing poor quality embryos , ( our data do n’t support that hypothesis , but let ’s just ignore that ) .
Acupuncture is harmless and people like it , so let ’s use it on every patient whether it works or not .
Patients will have to pay $ 150 extra , but I ’m willing to decide for them that the expense is worth it .
What ?!
Domar ’s study was intended to replicate an earlier study by Paulus from 2002 , the first randomized , controlled , prospective study on the impact of acupuncture in 160 IVF patients with good quality embryos .
The treatment group got 25 minutes of acupuncture before and after the IVF procedure , and the control group rested for 25 minutes .
The pregnancy rate was significantly higher in the acupuncture group .
Domar also mentions a subsequent study that the Paulus ’ group did with the same protocol but using sham acupuncture as a control .
There was no significant difference .
They proposed an “ acupressure ” effect of sham acupuncture , assuming that both groups achieved a greater pregnancy rate than they would have with no treatment ; but the data do n’t support that hypothesis since there was no comparable control group of untreated patients selected for good quality embryos .
For some reason , they opted not to publish this second , negative study .
It was only presented orally at a conference in Madrid in June 2003 .
( Paulus WE , Zhang M , Strehler E , Seybold B , Sterzik K. Placebo - controlled trial of acupuncture effects in assisted reproduction therapy .
2003 : Oral presentation , ESHRE , Madrid , Spain , June 2003 ; 18 ( Suppl1 ) : xviii18 . )
Domar ’s intent was to repeat Paulus ’ study and also investigate the potential of a placebo effect .
Double blind acupuncture studies are impossible : the patients know they are getting acupuncture and the acupuncturist knows he ’s giving it .
But for the first time Domar tried to blind the rest of the IVF treatment team so no one else knew which group a patient was in .
She expected the acupuncture patients not only to have a higher pregnancy rate ( PR ) , but also to be more optimistic and confident that their cycle would be successful , thus demonstrating a placebo effect .
The acupuncture patients were indeed less anxious and more optimistic , but they were not more confident , and the PR was not higher .
They were asked “ how optimistic do you feel ” and “ how confident do you feel ” about the outcome of the current cycle of IVF .
I ’m not sure where I would draw the line between optimism and confidence ; the whole thing is a bit nebulous .
And one could argue that false optimism may not be a good thing .
If a patient is confident that the IVF will work this time , she will have to deal with greater disappointment when it does n’t work .
They ca n’t understand why they got negative results when previous studies got positive results ; but to my mind if acupuncture is no better than placebo , the very fact that the IVF treatment team was blinded would tend to reduce part of the apparent placebo effect .
They point out that this is the first study from the United States .
In R. Barker Bausell ’s book Snake Oil Science , he shows why studies from other countries are more likely to get positive results .
( Anecdotally , I recently heard from a friend with contacts in China that a political officer in at least one Chinese research institution reviews all studies before they are submitted for publication and routinely vetoes any studies with negative results . )
It is common for a new study in the US to contradict previous studies from elsewhere .
And it is common for a well - designed study to contradict results of previous studies .
Now here ’s the part that really blew my mind .
In 2005 , Alice Domar wrote “ Acupuncture and infertility : we need to stick to good science . ”
She pointed out flaws in existing IVF / acupuncture research and mentioned several studies that got negative results ( studies that are not mentioned in the review of the literature in the introduction to the current study ) .
She also mentioned one where the acupuncture group had greater pregnancy loss after a second session .
She clearly postulated that the apparent effects of acupuncture might be only a placebo effect , and she suggested that there could even be harmful effects .
Then she recommended that future studies include a sham treatment .
Why , oh why , did she ignore her own advice and do this new study without a sham treatment ?
She offers no explanation .
Even her psychological findings are suspect because she compared a relaxing acupuncture treatment ( “ how relaxed did you feel during the sessions ? ” ) to an inadequate control : no treatment at all .
Would a relaxing massage have produced even better psychological results than acupuncture ?
The whole thing smells of “ I want to use acupuncture no matter what . ”
Indeed , Domar heads the Domar Center for Mind / Body Health , where acupuncture and other kinds of “ mind / body medicine ” are offered .
She does not question the choice of acupuncture points .
They were chosen for their sedative effect as well as to increase uterine blood flow .
How can she be sure they have these effects ?
She offers no references to support those claims .
If they do have these effects , is there any evidence that sedation and increased uterine blood flow increase fertility ?
How would that work ?
Do we have any evidence that anxiety or deficient uterine blood flow impair IVF ?
( In fact , this study found that the patients in the acupuncture group report reported less anxiety but did not have better outcome ) .
Is n’t this an example of what I have called Tooth Fairy Science ?
We can study the amount of money left by the Tooth Fairy in different settings , but since we have n’t determined that there is really a Tooth Fairy , any conclusions we reach will be falsely attributed to an imaginary being rather than to the real cause ( parental behavior ) .
In acupuncture studies , the acupuncture points / meridians / qi may be imaginary and we may be studying an elaborate placebo rather than a real physiologic phenomenon .
This study fits a pattern .
The original study by Paulus showed an effect of acupuncture on PR but only compared to a no- treatment control group .
When he repeated the study with a sham acupuncture control group , there was no difference between the “ real ” acupuncture and the sham acupuncture groups .
When Domar improved on the methodology by blinding the treatment team , acupuncture had no effect on PR .
As controls are tightened , the effect disappears .
If this same pattern appeared in successive studies of a prescription drug , I doubt if Domar would be recommending it for all patients , even if the drug had no reported side effects and the patients felt better when they took it – and even if it “ only ” cost $ 150 .
Of course , if the same pattern appeared in drug studies , the drug would not even be on the market .
Domar et al have tried to do good science and have contributed to the evidence against acupuncture .
Unfortunately , they seem not to want to accept the implications of their own results ; and the poor reporting in the MedlinePlus article only muddied the waters further .

A library for serial ports
I 've just uploaded serial - 0.1 , a library for line - oriented interaction with serial ports on POSIX compatible systems , to Hackage : http://hackage.haskell.org/cgi-bin/hackage-scripts/package/serial
At the moment it 's just two modules , one of which wraps up the serial connection in a convenience function ( System . Serial ) , and the other ( System. Serial .
Manager ) which further wraps a serial connection in a set of functions to let multiple commands go to a non-blocking device on the far end of the port and , with the proper parsers and a little luck , get the responses sent back to all the right calling functions .
The interface is not final yet .
I 'm using Parsec parsers passed with the command to sort out where return values should go , and that may just become predicates later .
Also , if someone who actually knows anything about programming on Windows wants to add that capability , I 'd be thrilled .

The British economy is heading for its worst year since the Great Depression , according to the latest predictions from the International Monetary Fund ( IMF ) .
The fund shocked analysts during a briefing in which it was revealed that the UK will see its economy shrink by 3.8 per cent in 2009 , and a further 0.2 per cent in 2010 – the only large economy predicted to still be in decline next year as well as this .
Some believe that the scale of the downturn signals the UK moving from recession to depression .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
The IMF expects the global economy to contract by 0.6 per cent this year , with the most frightening situation developing in Japan , with a 5 per cent slump predicted there .
The IMF had previously thought the world economy would fall by 0.5 per cent .
Behind the raw statistics are some grim economic realities .
A downgrade of growth of these proportions means that the UK is set for a much sharper decline in its fortunes than in any of the previous recessions since the Second World War .
It will mean an even worse rise in unemployment , widely expected to breach the two million barrier today before hitting more than 3 million this time next year .
Property values , consumer spending and the public finances will all be badly affected .
The revelations will prove acutely embarrassing to the Prime Minister as he prepares to host the G20 summit of the world 's largest and fastest - growing economies in London on 2 April .
Gordon Brown 's ambitions to lead the world response to the economic crisis will be undermined if his own economy is demonstrating such feebleness in response to policy measures he and the Bank of England announced in recent months , in an effort to fix the banking system .
The Prime Minister , say critics , will have presided over a " boom and bust " economy .
George Osborne , the shadow Chancellor , said : " These IMF forecasts show that Britain is set to have the longest recession of all the major economies .
It is further evidence that Gordon Brown 's economic model is fundamentally broken and his policies on the recession are n't working .
Thanks to Labour the recession in Britain will be longer and deeper . "
Government sources accused the IMF of " moving the goalposts " and dramatically revising the forecasts it made in January .
They said that what mattered at such a volatile time was the data on Britain 's actual performance , and so far it had been affected less badly than the US , Germany , Japan and Italy .
Officials said the IMF had made much larger reductions for 2009 for other countries , with Japan moving from minus 2 per cent to minus 5 per cent since January .
For 2010 , the downward revision for the UK since January was 0.4 per cent and for the US 1.4 per cent .
For 2009 and 2010 , the UK's growth has been downgraded from minus 2.8 per cent and 0.2 per cent to minus 3.8 per cent and minus 0.2 per cent respectively .
The UK seems to be suffering from a peculiarly nasty cocktail of factors .
First is the size and weakness of the UK 's banking system and a previous reliance on financial services .
The credit crunch has thus restricted lending and seen more bank failures here than in some other nations .
Second , and partially as a result of that , the UK 's property boom has turned to bust more dramatically than in many other places , as the supply of home loan finance has evaporated .
Third , the UK depends for about 17 per cent of its income on exports , which are being battered by the global collapse in demand .

All this has meant that Britain 's manufacturing , construction and finance sectors have haemorrhaged jobs .
Only the public sector is showing any signs of resilience .
The numbers will prove a problem to the Treasury as it prepares for the Budget next month .
The public finances are already severely squeezed under the existing Treasury assumption of a contraction of about 1 per cent in the economy this year .
Borrowing – forecast to peak at £ 118bn next year – will soar even higher .
The IMF says the US economy will shrink by 2.6 per cent this year , compared with a January forecast of a 1.6 per cent contraction .
The eurozone economy , dominated by Germany , is expected to contract by 3.2 per cent , down from January 's forecast of a 2 per cent decline .
In recent weeks the director general of the IMF , Dominique Strauss - Kahn , has called the slowdown the " Great Recession " .
3.8 %
The amount the British economy is predicted to shrink by this year , according to figures from the IMF .
Obama ’s grandmother to make pilgrimage to Mecca , ultimate Muslim religious experience
Looks like 2009 is going to be a big , big year for Sarah Obama , the President ’s grandmother .
First she attended her definitely , positively , absolutely non-Muslim grandson ’s Presidential inauguration in January .
Now it ’s been announced that she will attend the hajj .
According to FreeDictionary.com , “ at least once in a lifetime a Muslim is expected to make a religious journey to Mecca and the Kaaba ; for a Muslim the hajj is the ultimate act of worship … ”

Editor 's note : CNN contributor Bob Greene is a best - selling author whose current book is " When We Get to Surf City : A Journey Through America in Pursuit of Rock and Roll , Friendship , and Dreams . "
" Tumbling tumbleweeds " have been romanticized in song , but they 're no fun in some parts of the U.S .
( CNN ) --
" Do we like them ? "
Patrick Victor , a game and fish commission employee in San Carlos , Arizona , repeated the question back to me as if I had proved my lunacy by asking it in the first place .
" Do we like tumbleweeds ? " he said .
" No one likes them .
They 're not like in the cowboy movies .
We consider them garbage -- worse than garbage .
There is nothing to treasure or cherish about a tumbleweed . "
We were talking about tumbleweeds because of a theory I had been pondering :
In this country , because of the immediacy of news , it seems as if everyone from one coast to the other is worrying obsessively about the same thing at the same time .
You name it : the banking meltdown one day , the feared floods in Fargo , North Dakota , the next ; the forced ouster of the head of General Motors one morning , followed soon after by the street demonstrations in London during the Group of 20 summit .
We all tend to fret together about one crisis at a time ; undoubtedly there will be something new for all of us to be nervous about together before sundown tonight .
So the goal here was to come up with something utterly unlikely -- something that , in 2009 , you would n't think would bother people -- and find out if it does .
Tumbleweeds .
That , just picked at random , was the test case .
" They can be a pretty big problem out here , " said Scott McGuire , a code enforcement inspector in Greeley , Colorado .
" When the wind is right , they 'll pile up right to the roofline of a house .
Seriously -- people can't see out of their windows or even easily get out of their homes . "
There was something instructive , even ( in an off - kilter way ) comforting , about learning this : the affirmation that , in this increasingly monolithic country , there are still local vexations that override the breaking news bulletins on the national networks , that people in one pocket of America are routinely dealing with forces that people a few hundred miles away are blissfully unaware of .
Just hearing about it makes life seem somehow more life - size .
" I meant what I said literally , " McGuire said , continuing on his pinned - in - the - house - by - tumbleweeds theme .
" They are big and prickly -- they can blow for hundreds of miles , sometimes all the way from Wyoming .
They go until the wind dies out or they run into something .
That 's when people can have piles of them pressing against their homes -- when the tumbleweeds stop there . "
Tumbleweeds , if you have n't thought about them in years , may seem like a gauzy memory from old Western movies , a nostalgic high - plains symbol of desolation and loneliness .
There was that campfire song by Roy Rogers and his group , the Sons of the Pioneers ; once you think of the lyrics and melody again , you can't get it out of your head :
" See them tumbling down / Pledging their love to the ground / Lonely but free I 'll be found / Drifting along with the tumbling tumbleweeds . "
But in the 21st century ?
In our connected - by - broadband , addicted - to - cell phones , technologically tethered nation ?
Tumbleweeds ?
As something to be concerned about ?
" They 're ugly and nasty , " said Charlene Hardin , the county manager of Roosevelt County , New Mexico .
" They can make our roads impassable .
You can see 12 - foot - high , chain - link fences with tumbleweeds piled all the way up to the top .
They 're very flammable -- toss a cigarette , and you have a big fire .
" Tumbleweeds are more than a nuisance out here .
We 'll get complaints from people who can't even get out of their own driveways because the tumbleweeds have them hemmed in . "
Tumbleweeds are mainly a plague in the West and Southwest : certainly not dire on the level of , say , a national security issue , but a perpetual pain in the neck .
They 're a gnarled and unpleasant - looking plant , useless as a crop or nutritionally ; they dry up , separate from their roots and blow across the land , spreading seeds .
They 're thorny , are often painful to the touch and can grow as big as trash bags -- it 's not uncommon to see tumbleweeds 4 feet in diameter rolling speedily along .
As Velda Bucklen , who lives west of Kersey , Colorado , and who was concerned about people just heaving errant tumbleweeds off their property and thus onto nearby lawns , wrote in a letter to the editor of her local newspaper : " They are prickly and strong .
... I have been guilty of tossing them into the street and sending them on their way .
....
Please do n't fight with your neighbors . "
The people of the United States , though , are nothing if not resourceful .
Just as you may have been unaware that tumbleweeds are a contemporary problem , so you may be heartened to learn that , as always , where some people see bad news , others see opportunity .
" I thought there might be some money in tumbleweeds , " said Linda Katz of Garden City , Kansas .
She was right .
She runs a company called Prairie Tumbleweed Farm ( its motto is " If they do n't tumble , we do n't sell them ! " ) , and she said she has found a steady mail - order market for tumbleweeds .
" Personally I 'm not fond of them , but apparently some people are , " she said .
" They 're just big , rolling weeds .
But people order them for wedding decorations .
People order them for dances .
Servicemen say tumbleweeds remind them of home .
I 've taken two orders already today . "
Finding them is not a challenge : " They just roll by the house . "
She grabs them , puts them in boxes and mails them off .
And , to answer your question before you can ask it : $ 25 for a large tumbleweed , $ 15 for a small .
Before we leave this topic so we can all return to more conventional news , a word from Bob Lee , director of weed and pest control in Cheyenne , Wyoming :
" I 've seen people here who have gone away for a two - week vacation , and when they come back , there are so many tumbleweeds in front of their house that they have to chop their way to the front door . "
So , Mr. Lee , is there one stirring and inspirational parting message you 'd like to convey to people ?
" Just that tumbleweeds do n't have any redeeming features , as far as I 'm aware of . "
The opinions expressed in this commentary are solely those of Bob Greene .

A number of police officers are under investigation after allegations that they stole cash or other valuables during an unprecedented police raid on more than 3,000 safe deposit boxes in three security vaults in London last year , The Independent has learnt .
Scotland Yard 's professional standards directorate is investigating nine complaints , include two allegations of theft , against police officers who took part in Operation Rize , the raid on three security vaults beneath some of London 's most select neighbourhoods .
It was claimed at the time that the operation , in which some officers were heavily armed , had uncovered an " Aladdin 's cave " of criminal proceeds worth at least £ 35 m .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
However Scotland Yard 's internal investigation comes amid wider concerns that the raids trampled on the privacy of 2,500 innocent box holders , who include a Holocaust survivor and High Court judges .
Each holder of the 3,554 boxes seized last June at the depositories operated by Safe Deposit Centres Ltd has had to prove they legitimately own items and cash found in the boxes , or face a criminal investigation .
Lawyers say the raid has set a disturbing precedent for indiscriminate " fishing trips " by police seeking evidence of wrongdoing .
Detectives from the Yard's Economic and Specialist Crime Directorate insist Rize has been a substantial success , leading to 40 arrests for offences ranging from running prostitution rings , money laundering , drug supply , paedophilia , burglary and benefit fraud .
Eleven prosecutions have been brought in connection with this raid , they say .
But an investigation by The Independent has revealed that nine complaints have been made against officers who took part in the raid , including two separate claims of theft : it has been alleged that small items of jewellery and £ 8,500 in cash were removed from boxes .
Three claims for compensation arising from damage to property caused by police , understood to total around £ 5,000 , are also being processed .
The Independent understands that among the unwitting box - holders caught up in Rize was a Jewish man who survived the Holocaust as a child .
He kept a lump sum in case his family ever needed to flee their home once more .
A father whose daughter was killed in a car accident had placed the cash compensation he received in a security box because he did not know what to do with it .
Another family was using a box to store money that a relative with a gambling addiction had " paid back " after years of theft .
Several High Court judges and senior police officers , as well as a well - known businessman and a scion of an international banking family were also clients of Safe Deposit Centres .
Some of the boxes held highly personal possessions , such as photographs and details of second families .
The contents of about 2,500 boxes have now been returned to customers while around 700 , containing up to £ 15 m in cash , have been passed to HM Revenue and Customs to be investigated for tax evasion .
Cash has only been returned after owners were able to provide documents proving its source and that any taxes due on the sum have been paid .
When Roger Mortlock , 59 , had his box returned to him after an exhaustive verification process for the £ 110,000 he had stored , he said it contained £ 8,500 less than it had the last time he counted the cash .

Mr Mortlock , who is being treated for cancer , said : " I got the box because we had been burgled twice .
Having a box does n't make you a criminal .
" I could n't believe the way I was treated .
I felt as if I was guilty until I had proved myself innocent .
It took months to even get to the stage where I was allowed to retrieve my belongings , and then I found that a substantial amount of the money had gone missing . "
Jeffrey Lewis , senior partner of law firm Lewis Nedas , which has represented more than 70 box - holders , said : " If police want to search a flat rented by a drugs dealer in a block of flats , they would ordinarily be granted a warrant to search the flat used by that particular suspect .
In this case , they have in effect smashed their way into every flat on no real credible basis . "
Lawrence Kelly , partner at Lawrence Stephens Solicitors , which has also represented box - holders , said : " What police seem to have achieved is to search and seize first , and then place the onus on the individual to prove they have acted lawfully . "
Detectives leading Operation Rize said they had reason to believe a " high percentage " of the boxes were being used by criminal gangs .
They admitted " innocent " box - holders had been inconvenienced by the investigation but underlined that the operation had scored significant success in targeting serious criminals .
A Metropolitan Police spokesman said : " A priority for the investigation has been to ensure that where contents are held legitimately , the owners have the contents returned to them as soon as possible . "

On the revelation that Nancy Pelosi was possibly consulted about torture techniques , namely waterboarding , by the Central Intelligence Agency as early as 2002 , one thing has confounded me :
Would you be so surprised if she had and do you really feel baffled that she has no desire to pursue serious investigations into torture allowed under the Bush administration ?
Pelosi and Harry Reid spent 2000 to 2006 cheering on the ‘ War on Terror ’ and giving a blank check to Bush ’s wars .
They then spent the election campaign of 2006 promising to end the Iraq war , halt the Bush tax cuts , and investigate torture and other Bush administration practices .
So , it ’s 2009 , and what exactly have they exactly accomplished with 3 years of a Democrat majority ?
We ’re still in Iraq , we ’re still in Afghanistan , AIPAC still controls America ’s destiny on Iran , Joe Lieberman is still a Democrat , the Patriot Act is not repealed , and Obama embraces the executive power to spy on citizens .
There ’s a reason there will never be a serious and thorough investigation of Bush era war crimes : Pelosi , Reid , and a majority of the Democrats spent 8 years being de facto accomplices of some of Bush ’s worst crimes .
They supported the Iraq War , they supported the Patriot Act , and they supported the warrantless wiretaps .
The Congressional Democrats had the power to say something and do something , and they did neither for 8 years of the worst Presidency in American history .
And that ’s a legacy they have no desire to bring up in the future .

Skeletons that may represent the remains of crew members from Columbus ' second excursion to the New World in 1493 - 94 were exhumed in 1990 by archaeologists from Italy and the Dominican Republic .
The burials were a part of La Isabela on the island of Hispaniola , now a part of the Dominican Republic and that was the first European settlement in the New World .
Now , a chemical analysis by University of Wisconsin - Madison archaeologist T. Douglas Price and colleagues of the teeth of these skeletons promises details of the individuals early life history , showing where they were born and what they ate , information that promises to reveal new clues about the first European explorers of the New World .

The adage that dead men tell no tales has long been disproved by archaeology .
Now , however , science is taking interrogation of the dead to new heights .
In a study that promises fresh and perhaps personal insight into the earliest European visitors to the New World , a team or researchers from the University of Wisconsin - Madison is extracting the chemical details of life history from the teeth of crew members Christopher Columbus left on the island of Hispaniola after his second voyage to America in 1493 - 94 .
" This is telling us about where people came from and what they ate as children , " explains T. Douglas Price , a UW - Madison professor of anthropology and the leader of the team conducting an analysis of the tooth enamel of three individuals from a larger group excavated almost 20 years ago from shallow graves at the site of La Isabela , the first European town in America .
Price and colleague James Burton , in collaboration with researchers from the Autonomous University of the Yucatan in Mexico , are attempting to flesh out the details of a colony that lasted less than five years .
The human remains used in the study were buried without the formalities of coffins or shrouds , and were excavated from what was once the church graveyard of the town Columbus established .
Headstones and other identifying markers have long since faded to nothing or have been lost entirely during the 500 years since the bodies were first interred .
Despite its brief existence , historians and archaeologists believe La Isabela was a substantial settlement with a church , public buildings such as a customhouse and storehouse , private dwellings and fortifications .
It is also the only known settlement in America where Columbus actually lived .
Although the town has been the subject of previous archaeological studies , the work by Price , Burton and their colleague Vera Tiesler and Andrea Cucina of the Autonomous University of the Yucatan is revealing new insight into the people who lived and sailed with Columbus , and who died on the shores of a strange and exotic new world .
Histories of La Isabela , named after Spain 's queen and Columbus 's patron and located in what is today the Dominican Republic , suggest its population was made up only of men from the fleet of 17 vessels that comprised Columbus 's second visit to the New World .
But the first analysis of the remains of 20 individuals excavated two decades ago by Italian and Dominican archaeologists portray a different picture , suggesting that living among the Spaniards at La Isabela were native Taínos , women and children , and possibly individuals of African origin .
If confirmed , that would put Africans in the New World as contemporaries of Columbus and decades before they were believed to have first arrived as slaves .
The study conducted by the Wisconsin researchers relied on isotopic analysis of three elements : carbon , oxygen and strontium .
Carbon isotope ratios provide reliable evidence of diet at the time an individual 's adult teeth emerge in childhood .
For example , people who eat maize , as opposed to those who consume wheat or rice , have different carbon isotope ratio profiles locked in their tooth enamel .
" Heavy carbon means you were eating tropical grasses such as maize , found only in the New World , or millet in Africa , neither of which was consumed in Europe " at the time , says Burton .
Oxygen isotopes provide information about water consumption and also can say something about geography as the isotopic composition of water changes in relation to latitude and proximity to the ocean .
Strontium is a chemical found in bedrock and that enters the body through the food chain as nutrients pass from bedrock to soil and water and , ultimately , to plants and animals .
The strontium isotopes found in tooth enamel , the most stable and durable material in the human body , thus constitute an indelible signature of where someone lived as a child .
Three of the individuals whose teeth were subjected to isotopic analysis by the Wisconsin group were males under the age of 40 and who had carbon isotope profiles far different from the rest , suggesting an Old World origin .
" I would bet money this person was an African , " Price says of one of the three individuals whose teeth were subjected to analysis .
It was known that Columbus had a personal African slave on his voyages of discovery .
The new analysis could mean that Africans played a much larger role in the first documented explorations of America .
The strontium isotope analysis , Price notes , is not yet complete , as samples from the teeth of the presumed sailors remain to be matched with strontium profiles of Spanish soils .
However , such matches could open an intriguing window to the personal identities of individuals buried in La Isabela .
" All of these sailors — their place of birth , their age — were recorded in Seville before they left on the second voyage , " Price explains .
" One of the things we 're hoping to do with the strontium is identify individuals . "
The skeletons also exhibit evidence of scurvy , a common affliction of 15th century sailors who lacked vitamin C on their long voyages , as well as signs of malnutrition and physical stress .
Chronicles of the voyage noted that most of the Europeans , including Columbus himself , fell sick shortly after landfall on Hispaniola , and many subsequently died , perhaps becoming the first to be buried in the La Isabela church graveyard .

The preacher said , “ What good does it profit a man if he gains the whole world and loses his soul ? ”
Hearing this , every one of the pilgrims gathered in the room asked , “ Is it me , Lord ? ”
In America , in Europe , people are asking , “ Is it us ? ”
Well , yes .
It is us .
Carnival is over .
Commerce has been overheating markets and climates ... the sooty skies of the industrial revolution have changed scale and location , but now melt ice caps and make the seas boil in the time of technological revolution .
Capitalism is on trial ; globalization is , once again , in the dock .
We used to say that all we wanted for the rest of the world was what we had for ourselves .
Then we found out that if every living soul on the planet had a fridge and a house and an S.U.V. , we would choke on our own exhaust .
Lent is upon us whether we asked for it or not .
And with it , we hope , comes a chance at redemption .
But redemption is not just a spiritual term , it ’s an economic concept .
At the turn of the millennium , the debt cancellation campaign , inspired by the Jewish concept of Jubilee , aimed to give the poorest countries a fresh start .
Thirty - four million more children in Africa are now in school in large part because their governments used money freed up by debt relief .
This redemption was not an end to economic slavery , but it was a more hopeful beginning for many .
And to the many , not the lucky few , is surely where any soul - searching must lead us .
A few weeks ago I was in Washington when news arrived of proposed cuts to the president ’s aid budget .
People said that it was going to be hard to fulfill promises to those who live in dire circumstances such a long way away when there is so much hardship in the United States .
And there is .
But I read recently that Americans are taking up public service in greater numbers because they are short on money to give .
And , following a successful bipartisan Senate vote , word is that Congress will restore the money that had been cut from the aid budget  a refusal to abandon those who would pay such a high price for a crisis not of their making .
In the roughest of times , people show who they are .
Your soul .
So much of the discussion today is about value , not values .
Aid well spent can be an example of both , values and value for money .
Providing AIDS medication to just under four million people , putting in place modest measures to improve maternal health , eradicating killer pests like malaria and rotoviruses  all these provide a leg up on the climb to self - sufficiency , all these can help us make friends in a world quick to enmity .
It ’s not alms , it ’s investment .
It ’s not charity , it ’s justice .

My friend Charles and I were faggots at eight years - old .
He was constantly reprimanded by teachers for screaming like a girl at recess .
He could reach Mariah Carey ear - bloodying pitches .
If he has transitioned to a female I would not be surprised — look me up on Facebook , girl !
My mother grew up in Texas , the only girl among two football - playing brothers and an ex-military father .
As a child , I was probably the gayest person she had ever met .
She struggled with wanting me to be happy , wanting to protect me , and probably being embarrassed my effeminate behavior .
She allowed me to have the movie , Grease , as my Bar - Mitzvah party theme ( complete with larger - than - life cutouts of the Pink Ladies )
Oh , and she would tap my wrists to let me know when they were limp .
Charles and I were at my house , busy dressing up , satiating our repressed femininity like a stoner munching out on Cool Ranch Doritos .
Sashaying to a Pointer Sisters cassette tape , my mother knocked on the door .
I frantically threw a sweatshirt on over my dress , struggling to get into a pair of sweatpants but like all dramatic stories , it was too late .
She barged in and caught us with our dresses down , so to speak .
She yanked my ass downstairs and into her Laura Ashley - clad bedroom .
Sitting on the edge of her bed , naked except for a bathrobe and one roller in the front of her hair , she slapped me in the face .
It was n’t an angry slap ; it was a panicked slap .
Then she cried and made me an appointment with a psychologist .
A ( former ) friend of mine once advised me that if I wanted to get a date , I should “ tone it down . ”

When I attempt to be straight - acting , whether it is for a laugh or to rapidly attain meaningless sex , I suspend all movement .
For a college course , I combed through the Village Voice ‘s male - for - male personal ads from 1970 - 2000 seeking trends in gay men ’s ideals of attractiveness .
The one constant across the 30 - year period was the long - standing “ No Fats , No Femmes ” sentiment .
Although my research is far from scientific I find personal ads to be a reasonable litmus test on this subject especially when they are easily accessible and free .
Scanning the pages of Los Angeles m4 m listings , the same words keep popping up : regular , normal , straight , frat , ex - frat , bi , straight - acting , discreet , and married .
I ’m sure many of these men are married — to other men .
Anyone looking for a queen ?
Let ’s see .
Keyword search : femme .
In the past seven days , 14 ads are posted containing the word “ femme . ”
Five specify no femmes .
Out of the nine pro-femme ads , I am ineligible for my favorite : “ Michelle Kwan roleplay for cute asian . ” Curses .
The word “ discreet ” comes up in over one thousand postings .
It is the new “ straight - acting . ”
There are two spellings of the word “ discreet . ”
The other spelling , “ discrete , ” means distinct , separate , and individual .
That is the antithesis of what these Craigslisters want in a man .
Discrete ’s double - E ’d sister is marked by modesty and prudence — two of my least favorite words .
“ Wise self - restraint , ” the second definition of “ discreet , ” is most applicable to the performance of straight - acting .
When I attempt to be straight - acting , whether it is for a laugh or to rapidly attain meaningless sex , I suspend all movement .
Gone are the gesticulations , the rubber - faces , or the rolling of eyeballs .
They are replaced with — well — nothing .
Speaking in a low monotone , any semblance of personality evaporates .
To be discreet , less is more .
Straightacting .com became well - known in 2000 for its “ famous Straight - Acting Quiz . ”
Multiple choice questions determine your level of straight - actingness .
Or lack thereof .
Questions range from how much you enjoy receiving flowers and the frequency you say “ pee- pee ” instead of penis , to how publicly affectionate you ’re willing to be with your partner in a “ non-gay environment . ”
Upon my arrival , any environment turns gay .
A Level 2 ( Very Straight Acting ) person is described as having “ carefully crafted ” actions “ in a way that they never appear to be considered too fem . ”
This is the very essence of straight - acting : the utter calculation of every movement , every word that comes out of your discreetly dick - eating mouth .
Kooky Level 6s , on the other hand , enjoy exploring their feminine side .
“ Most people just assume you are gay … which is just fine with you . ”
But not fine with the creators and patrons of this site who hold faux masculinity in the highest regard .
The intelligentsia behind StraightActing.com chalk up their penchant for straight - acting men to simple preference : “ Just as people have preferences for the type of guys they like , for example , ‘ Tall men , ’ many of us have a preference for ‘ straight acting ’ men —
Men that ( sic ) have very few effeminate traits but still like to get down with other men . ”
Get down with other men ?
Is that some demented idea of how masculine men speak ?
Cue effeminate eye - rolling .
More importantly , their glorification of straight - acting is not preference , it is bias .
For the men of StraightActing.com and the allegedly married - to - women , bisexual , ex - frat boys of Craigslist , I empathize with you .
I get it .
I hope for both you and me that we can expand our ideals of beauty and evolve into a state of self love .
Here ’s to becoming more discrete .
And less discreet .

A former SAS officer who passed secret details of MPs ’ expenses claims to The Daily Telegraph broke cover last night to insist he had “ no regrets ” about the leak that has rocked Westminster .
John
Wick said the release of the information over the last fortnight had exposed the parliamentary expenses system to “ its rotten core ” .
Mr Wick , the head of a corporate intelligence company specialising in the release of hostages in war zones , was named as an intermediary between an anonymous parliamentary source and the Telegraph .
He claimed that the details had not been stolen , and was withering about the “ lax ” security procedures in the Commons for handling the claims .
Mr Wick contacted several newspapers and eventually passed over more than one million pages of unedited receipts to the Telegraph .
The paper is rumoured to have paid between £ 60,000 and £ 70,000 for the details , but has consistently refused to disclose whether any money changed hands .

Mr Wick was unrepentant last night over his part in getting the uncensored claims – rather than the censored version being prepared by the Commons – into the public domain .
He said : “ Parliament will be a better place , society will be a better place .
Sometimes a marker has to be put down .
The public has put a marker down .
It ’s good . ”
He disclosed he supported the Tories , but said he was not motivated by party - political concerns .
“ This was a scandal across the political spectrum with some Conservative MPs ’ behaviour as reprehensible as their Labour counterparts .
The public release of the information had to be thorough , across every party , and the Conservatives would have to accept the consequences with the other parties . ”
He said he was conscious of the risks he was running , but had decided to act after the public was frustrated in its attempts to learn about politicians ’ expense claims .
He said : “ We ’ve all had concerns about the expenses purely because of how they ’ve handled our requests for information .
We ’ve reached a stage in society where they want to know everything about us – I think we ’re entitled to know about them . ”
Mr Wick said he had been contacted in March about a hard drive containing all MPs ’ expenses claims of the past four years .
He said his contact , who he did not identify , had indicated that “ those directly involved in processing the raw data were shocked and appalled by what they were seeing ” .
He went on : “ I was assured that the data was not stolen , but that it was an unregistered copy that had been produced as a result of the lax and unprofessional security procedures used in the House of Commons ”
He claimed : “ I do not believe the parliamentary staff handling the data were security cleared and people working on the information were never checked when leaving , nor did they work in a secure environment .
All of this must have been known by the Speaker ’s office , which failed to act and be responsible for the data and those working on it . ”

A skill that emerges naturally for managers after conducting a relatively small number of recruiting efforts is the ability to recognize common anti-patterns in resumes that are contra-indicators of good developers .
I ’m not talking about the major faux pas that have been repeatedly covered in generic articles about job hunting , but rather the nuanced messages that are communicated to a technical hiring manager who has learned to read between the lines .
This article is intended as cautionary advice to help prospective developers avoid the most common and damaging mistakes beyond simple typos and grammar considerations .
Risk Level :
For senior candidates , most of the mistakes described below are fatal to your candidacy .
For more entry level technical positions I am more likely to let these types of issues slide , but do use them to differentiate candidates that are otherwise equally qualified , so it still makes sense to be mindful of them .
Tip # 1 : Do n’t be hyper-specific
One of the most effective ways to portray yourself as a novice or one - trick - pony is to pile on the trivial details when describing past jobs or projects .
I understand that you are proud of your accomplishments , and know how easy it is to get wordy when drafting the Book of Moi , but remember that a resume is a brochure , not a biography .
The prime objective of a resume is to get you booked for an interview , not to close the sale .
The interview is a much better forum to brag about the implementation specifics of the “ Monolith 3.0 Infrastructure Upgrade Project ” because it allows you to adjust the message as you deliver it to hone in on whatever aspects resonate with the interviewer .
The key problem with being too specific arises from the undesirable subtext it creates .
I think this is demonstrated well in the following excerpt from a real resume submitted for a Web developer job that I was trying to fill .
“ Created stored procedures to fetch query results from the database for higher performance .
Involved in writing complex SQL queries that required data from multiple tables using inner and outer joins . ”
Gems of this type are hardly rare .
I see variants of this exact statement so often in developer resumes that I can now spot them as quickly as if they were marked with a yellow highlighter pen .
My mind automatically drifts to the same questions every time I see something like this …
Question 1 : Why is this person making such a big deal about menial tasks like writing a stored procedure and using specific join types ?
Option A : They find writing SQL / Stored Procs very difficult and consider it a major accomplishment to have done so .
Option B : They did n’t have much to talk about in the resume and are padding it with trivialities to seem more qualified .
Option C : They just learned about joins and are proud of that accomplishment .
Question 2 : Why call out that they wrote the procedure specifically to query data ?
Option A : Maybe they have never written a query that modifies data , are they that inexperienced ?
Option B : Are they trying to educate me about what a stored procedure is ?
Do they think this is n’t common knowledge ?
Perhaps it is n’t to them .
Another example from the same resume :
“ Designed online store by using ASP .
Net .
This system allowed user to order the products from the store and user can accept the order or cancel the order . “
Question 3 : Did this person do substantial work on the project or just write the code for the “ Accept ” and “ Cancel ” buttons ?
My advice to the author of this resume would be to take Vince Lombardi ’s advice and “ Act like you ’ve been there before . ”
By assuming the details , it conveys a tone that the candidate considers the specifics of optimizing queries as routine and not worth bragging about .
The discussion about the specifics of the clever optimization technique are best saved for the interview .
Here is a reworked version that generalizes the same sentiment without dwelling on the trivia .
“ Substantially improved performance of company ’s core accounting package by profiling and optimizing database access code . ”
Another major problem with getting too far into the weeds on a resume is that it implies that the resume is a comprehensive .
By being asymmetrically specific about experience with various technologies , it has the effect of implying that the applicant is less competent in skills that are described more generally and not skilled in those that are not explicitly mentioned .
In the above example , by specifically calling out experience with SELECT queries , it leads the reader to the conclude that the candidate might not be able to form other types of queries .
Be mindful that what you do say often speaks volumes about what you do n’t .
Tip # 2 : Do n’t egregiously add keywords in the narrative sections
It could be argued that being specific in a resume gives you an opportunity to get all the buzzwords in , and this is true .
The gatekeepers to most jobs are recruiters and HR people who use keywords from the job requisition to locate candiates on sites like monster.com and internal recruiting databases often without understanding their meaning .
For this reason , I like the idea of separating out the keywords in to a separate “ skills ” section on the resume .
This makes it easy for recruiters to scan your list of competencies by grouping them together , and makes the narrative parts easier to read for the hiring manager who does n’t need to be prejudiced by that level of detail .
Here are a couple of examples from resumes that work a little too hard to jam keywords into the job history .
“ Debugged and fixed the bugs which reported in TestTrack Pro by Seapine Software , Inc. according to SDLC . ”
“ Designed the database in SQL Server using database normal forms to prevent data redundancy and ER ( Entity Relationship ) diagrams . ”
Although it is amusing , I ’ll forgo a discussion on whether using normal forms actually “ prevent ER diagrams . ”
If only …

These days many Russian online communities hit by the discussion of these photos .
They were published in one popular Russian blog and the guy who published claimed that he has found the unique rare photographs of his grandfather from WW2 when he encountered the Nazi Robots .
Of course many did n’t believe this and found the same things are in Lucas “ Star Wars ” movie , but many were fooled and this caused a big buzz , spread across many blogs .
At least this is one of a few posts when the comments can be “ photoshop ” for sure ..

Pop icon Madonna failed in her bid to adopt a second child from Malawi after a court Friday rejected her application , warning that the case could open the door to trafficking in children .
Madonna did not attend the closed - door court hearing in the administrative capital Lilongwe , and her lawyer did not speak to reporters as he left .
Judge Esmie Chondo's ruling addressed widespread concerns that by facilitating international adoptions , Malawi 's courts could inadertently expose the nation 's children to the threat of human traffickers .
" I must confess that there 's a gripping temptation to throw caution to the wind and grant an adoption in the hope that there will be a difference in the life of just one child , " she said .

Recycling Our Way to a More Sustainable Future
May 12th , 2009 by Gavin Newsom
Editor ’s note :
This post is a contribution by San Francisco Mayor Gavin Newsom .
See his last post on electric vehicle charging infrastructure or all of his previous posts here .
A companion piece was also posted on RedGreenandBlue.org earlier today .
San Francisco is a city that knows how to recycle .
We work hard to give new life to our paper , bottles , cans and other waste .
New statistics released today show we are keeping 72 percent of all discards from going to the landfill – up from 70 percent the year before .
That ’s a big leap for one year .
The most significant gains came from the recycling of material from building sites – due in large part to our 2006 mandatory Construction and Demolition Debris Recovery Ordinance .
By requiring builders to recycle debris from construction projects , we were able to divert tens of thousands of new tons of material away from the landfill .
This ordinance is unique in that it does n’t require deposits or bonds , making it small business - friendly and limiting the amount of bureaucracy needed to implement the program .
When it comes to our recycling programs , we ’re always in the development phase .
In order to meet our ambitious goal of 75 percent recycling by 2010 and zero waste by 2020 , we are constantly looking for additional materials to recycle , and for emerging markets to make use of our recyclables .
A few years back we developed — along with the company Recology , our partner in recycling — an innovative program to collect food scraps and turn them into organic soil .
Local farms and vineyards now use this soil to grow crops , which are then sold back to consumers in San Francisco .
We close the loop locally .
We ’ve also recently started recycling almost all types of plastic .
We take everything except plastic bags and Styrofoam .
Most of it gets made into plastic molding and bender board .
A seventy - two percent diversion rate from the landfill is something to be proud of , and I congratulate every San Francisco resident , business , and visitor who helped us along the way .
But we ca n’t rest on our laurels , not when there are so many valuable resources still going to the dump .
We recently conducted a waste stream analysis and discovered that about two thirds of the stuff people throw away — half a million tons each year — could have been recycled or turned to compost .
If were able to capture everything , we would have a recycling rate of 90 percent .
That ’s why I ’ve introduced an ordinance that will make it mandatory for everyone — homeowners , businesses , or renters — to use our recycling and composting programs .
If we can get food scrap collection service into large apartment buildings that currently do n’t have it , we ’re going to see another great year for recycling .
On a final note , the flip side to how much you recycle is how little you send to the landfill .
Our disposal tonnage is the lowest it ’s been in over 30 years .
Our recycling programs can and have been implemented in cities around the world .

This column updates the original Vox columns by Barry Eichengreen and Kevin O’Rourke comparing today ’s global crisis to the Great Depression .
The three previous columns have shattered all Vox readership records with over 450,000 views .
This latest edition covers up to February 2010 showing that , while there is cause for optimism , there is no room for complacency .
Editor 's Note :
This column updates the original Vox columns by Barry Eichengreen and Kevin O’Rourke comparing today ’s global financial crisis to the Great Depression .
The previous columns have shattered all Vox readership records with over 450,000 views ( O’Rourke and Eichengreen 2009 ) .
The latest data cover up to February 2010 , the original April 2009 column and the subsequent updates appear below .
Click here to read the original column .
Global output
Global industrial production continues to recover – something for which policy deserves considerable credit ( as we have argued on this site , see Almunia et al 2009 and O’Rourke and Eichengreen 2009 ) .
But before indulging in self - congratulation , policymakers should note that the level of industrial production is still 6 % below its previous peak ( figure 1 ) .
( At the trough it was 13 % below its previous peak . )
It follows that considerable excess capacity remains in a number of important economies .
Exiting now from policies of stimulus in those countries would therefore be premature .
Figure 1 . World industrial production , now vs. then
World trade
World trade also continues to recover but remains 8 % below its previous peak ( figure 2 ) .
( At the trough it was 20 % below its previous peak . )
The roots of this collapse of trade remain to be fully understood , although recent research has begun to shed light on some of the causes ( see Baldwin 2009 and Chor and Manova 2009 ) .
Figure 2 . Volume of world trade , now vs. then
Equity markets
World equity markets are now 25 % below peak ( figure 3 ) .
( At their trough they were 50 % below peak . )
There was a break in the upward trend in January 2010 that may signal investors ’ growing concern about the danger of a double dip – although if the crisis has taught us anything , it has taught us that too much should not be made of the forecasting ability of financial markets .

Editor ’s note :
The original Vox column by Barry Eichengreen and Kevin O’Rourke shattered all Vox readership records ( 30,000 views in two days , over 100,000 in a week , now fast approaching 350,000 ) .
Here the authors provide updated charts , presenting monthly data up through June 2009 ( or latest ) .
What do the new data tell us ?
Global industrial production now shows clear signs of recovering .
This is a sharp divergence from experience in the Great Depression , when the decline in industrial production continued fully for three years .
The question now is whether final demand for this increased production will materialise or whether consumer spending , especially in the US , will remain weak , causing the increase in production to go into inventories , leading firms to cut back subsequently , and resulting in a double dip recession .
Global stock markets have mounted a sharp recovery since the beginning of the year .
Nonetheless , the proportionate decline in stock market wealth remains even greater than at the comparable stage of the Great Depression .
The downward spiral in global trade volumes has abated , and the most recent month for which we have data ( June ) shows a modest uptick .
Nonetheless , the collapse of global trade , even now , remains dramatic by the standards of the Great Depression .

Editor ’s note : The 6 April 2009 Vox column by Barry Eichengreen and Kevin O’Rourke shattered all Vox readership records , with 30,000 views in less than 48 hours and over 100,000 within the week .
The authors will update the charts as new data emerges ; this updated column is the first , presenting monthly data up to April 2009 .
( The updates and much more will eventually appear in a paper the authors are writing a paper for Economic Policy . )
New findings :
World industrial production continues to track closely the 1930s fall , with no clear signs of ‘ green shoots ’ .
World stock markets have rebounded a bit since March , and world trade has stabilised , but these are still following paths far below the ones they followed in the Great Depression .
There are new charts for individual nations ’ industrial output .
The big -4 EU nations divide north - south ; today ’s German and British industrial output are closely tracking their rate of fall in the 1930s , while Italy and France are doing much worse .
The North Americans ( US & Canada ) continue to see their industrial output fall approximately in line with what happened in the 1929 crisis , with no clear signs of a turn around .
Japan ’s industrial output in February was 25 percentage points lower than at the equivalent stage in the Great Depression .
There was however a sharp rebound in March .
The facts for Chile , Belgium , Czechoslovakia , Poland and Sweden are displayed below ; note the rebound in Eastern Europe .

Start of original column ( published 6 April 2009 )
The parallels between the Great Depression of the 1930s and our current Great Recession have been widely remarked upon .
Paul Krugman has compared the fall in US industrial production from its mid-1929 and late - 2007 peaks , showing that it has been milder this time .
On this basis he refers to the current situation , with characteristic black humour , as only “ half a Great Depression . ”
The “ Four Bad Bears ” graph comparing the Dow in 1929 - 30 and S&P 500 in 2008 - 9 has similarly had wide circulation ( Short 2009 ) .
It shows the US stock market since late 2007 falling just about as fast as in 1929 - 30 .
Comparing the Great Depression to now for the world , not just the US
This and most other commentary contrasting the two episodes compares America then and now .
This , however , is a misleading picture .
The Great Depression was a global phenomenon .
Even if it originated , in some sense , in the US , it was transmitted internationally by trade flows , capital flows and commodity prices .
That said , different countries were affected differently .
The US is not representative of their experiences .
Our Great Recession is every bit as global , earlier hopes for decoupling in Asia and Europe notwithstanding .
Increasingly there is awareness that events have taken an even uglier turn outside the US , with even larger falls in manufacturing production , exports and equity prices .
In fact , when we look globally , as in Figure 1 , the decline in industrial production in the last nine months has been at least as severe as in the nine months following the 1929 peak .
( All graphs in this column track behaviour after the peaks in world industrial production , which occurred in June 1929 and April 2008 . )
Here , then , is a first illustration of how the global picture provides a very different and , indeed , more disturbing perspective than the US case considered by Krugman , which as noted earlier shows a smaller decline in manufacturing production now than then .
Figure 1 . World Industrial Output , Now vs Then Source : Eichengreen and O’Rourke ( 2009 ) and IMF .
Similarly , while the fall in US stock market has tracked 1929 , global stock markets are falling even faster now than in the Great Depression ( Figure 2 ) .
Again this is contrary to the impression left by those who , basing their comparison on the US market alone , suggest that the current crash is no more serious than that of 1929 - 30 .
Figure 2 . World Stock Markets , Now vs Then Source : Global Financial Database .
Another area where we are “ surpassing ” our forbearers is in destroying trade .
World trade is falling much faster now than in 1929 - 30 ( Figure 3 ) .
This is highly alarming given the prominence attached in the historical literature to trade destruction as a factor compounding the Great Depression .
Figure 3 . The Volume of World Trade , Now vs Then Sources : League of Nations Monthly Bulletin of Statistics , http://www.cpb.nl/eng/research/sector2/data/trademonitor.html
It ’s a Depression alright
To sum up , globally we are tracking or doing even worse than the Great Depression , whether the metric is industrial production , exports or equity valuations .
Focusing on the US causes one to minimise this alarming fact .
The “ Great Recession ” label may turn out to be too optimistic .
This is a Depression - sized event .
That said , we are only one year into the current crisis , whereas after 1929 the world economy continued to shrink for three successive years .
What matters now is that policy makers arrest the decline .
We therefore turn to the policy response .
Policy responses :
Then and now
Figure 4 shows a GDP - weighted average of central bank discount rates for 7 countries .
As can be seen , in both crises there was a lag of five or six months before discount rates responded to the passing of the peak , although in the present crisis rates have been cut more rapidly and from a lower level .
There is more at work here than simply the difference between George Harrison and Ben Bernanke .
The central bank response has differed globally .
Figure 4 . Central Bank Discount Rates , Now vs Then ( 7 country average ) Source : Bernanke and Mihov ( 2000 ) ; Bank of England , ECB , Bank of Japan , St. Louis Fed , National Bank of Poland , Sveriges Riksbank .
Figure 5 shows money supply for a GDP - weighted average of 19 countries accounting for more than half of world GDP in 2004 .
Clearly , monetary expansion was more rapid in the run-up to the 2008 crisis than during 1925 - 29 , which is a reminder that the stage - setting events were not the same in the two cases .
Moreover , the global money supply continued to grow rapidly in 2008 , unlike in 1929 when it levelled off and then underwent a catastrophic decline .
Figure 5 . Money Supplies , 19 Countries , Now vs Then Source : Bordo et al. ( 2001 ) , IMF International Financial Statistics , OECD Monthly Economic Indicators .
Figure 6 is the analogous picture for fiscal policy , in this case for 24 countries .
The interwar measure is the fiscal surplus as a percentage of GDP .
The current data include the IMF ’s World Economic Outlook Update forecasts for 2009 and 2010 .
As can be seen , fiscal deficits expanded after 1929 but only modestly .
Clearly , willingness to run deficits today is considerably greater .
Figure 6 . Government Budget Surpluses , Now vs Then Source : Bordo et al. ( 2001 ) , IMF World Economic Outlook , January 2009 .
Conclusion
To summarise : the world is currently undergoing an economic shock every bit as big as the Great Depression shock of 1929 - 30 .
Looking just at the US leads one to overlook how alarming the current situation is even in comparison with 1929 - 30 .
The good news , of course , is that the policy response is very different .
The question now is whether that policy response will work .
For the answer , stay tuned for our next column .

Mercury was not detected in eleven out of twenty HFCS samples analyzed ( detection limit 0.005 μg mercury / g ) .
A single manufacturer produced nine of these eleven samples .
These samples were likely manufactured using caustic soda produced by a membrane chlor - alkali plant which does not use mercury in its manufacturing process .
Eight of the nine HFCS samples exhibiting mercury levels between 0.065 μg to 0.570 μg mercury / g HFCS were produced by the other two manufacturers .
This could indicate the use of mercury grade caustic soda or hydrochloric acid in the manufacturing processes used by these two manufacturers .
Such use would account for the mercury in these HFCS products .
With key aspects of the HFCS manufacturing process considered proprietary information , we could not confirm the composition of the raw materials used by the individual HFCS manufacturers and the subsequent source of the mercury .
While more sophisticated methods produce lower detection limits , the CVAAS method used in these analyses was sufficient as it clearly and reliably demonstrated significant levels of mercury in 45 % of the HFCS samples analyzed .
Clearly the sample size of this preliminary trial is too small but there was no support to collect additional samples for analyses .
When university researchers outside of the government attempted to obtain additional HFCS samples direct from the manufacturer they were unable to get them .
However , with 45 % of the HFCS samples containing mercury in this small study , it would be prudent and perhaps essential for public health that additional research be conducted by the FDA or some other public health agency to determine if products containing HFCS also contain mercury .
In 2004 , several member states of the European Union reported finding mercury concentrations in beverages , cereals and bakery ware , and sweeteners [ 14 ] – all of which may contain HFCS .
FDA does not currently have a mercury surveillance program for food ingredients such as added sugars or preservatives manufactured with mercury grade chlor - alkali products .
The FDA does analyze some foods for mercury through the ongoing surveillance program known as the Total Diet Study ( TDS ) .
The TDS , however , does not test all foods for mercury .
Mercury is routinely detected by the TDS in fish , liver , and poultry because farmers routinely use fishmeal and / or fish oil as feed for certain livestock to include chickens , swine , dairy cows , and farmed fish .
Animals that are fed fishmeal can bioconcentrate monomethyl mercury in protein matrices that are then passed on to the consumer in the fat components of derived foods [ 15 ] .
A list of the foods that were recently tested for total mercury along with the results of the analyses may be found at the FDA website [ 16 ] .
In 2003 , FDA tested 48 foods for mercury during the TDS and of those only three may have contained HFCS .
Average daily US consumption of HFCS for the year 2007 was approximately 49.8 g per person according to the US Department of Agriculture website [ 17 ] .
High - end consumers of beverages sweetened with HFCS could easily be ingesting more HFCS than the average person .
Results of a recent study of dietary fructose consumption among US children and adults indicate that fructose consumption by Americans represents ten percent ( 10 % ) of calories consumed in a 24 - hour period [ 18 ] .
Seventy four percent ( 74 % ) of this fructose came from foods and beverages other than fruits and vegetables .
With respect to product labeling , FDA requires food manufacturers to list on the food product label ingredients in descending order of weight from most to least [ 19 ] .
For example , HFCS is commonly listed as the first ingredient in chocolate syrup on the product label , therefore all that can be known is that of all the ingredients in chocolate syrup , there is more HFCS in the product than any other ingredient .
Product labels listing HFCS as a first or second ingredient may contain detectable levels of mercury if the HFCS was manufactured with mercury grade chlor - alkali chemicals .
As part of the review process for this article , the authors contacted manufacturers for more information on the % concentration of HFCS in their products and the common response back from manufacturers was that this information is proprietary .
With the reported average daily consumption of 49.8 g HFCS per person , however , and our finding of mercury in the range of 0.00 to 0.570 μg mercury / g HFCS , we can estimate that the potential average daily total mercury exposure from HFCS could range from zero to 28.4 μg mercury .
This range can be compared to the range of total mercury exposure from dental amalgam in children reported by Health Canada [ 20 ] .
In the report issued by Canada , daily estimates of total mercury exposure from dental amalgam in children ages 3 – 19 ranged on average from 0.79 to 1.91 μg mercury .
Canada and other countries do not recommend the use of mercury amalgam in pregnant women or children .
Current international food processing standards allow 1.0 μg mercury / g caustic soda [ 21 , 22 ] and there is no standard for mercury in food grade hydrochloric acid .
Both of these chemicals may be used to make HFCS .
The FDA has approved HFCS for use as an added sugar in food products but a review of food product labels reveals that it is often added to a product in addition to sugar presumably to enhance product shelf life .
Regardless of its intended use , it is imperative that public health officials evaluate this potential source of mercury exposure , as HFCS is presently ubiquitous in processed foods and therefore significantly consumed by people all over the world .
Mercury in any form – either as water - soluble inorganic salt , a lipid - soluble organic mercury compound , or as metallic mercury - is an extremely potent neurological toxin [ 23 ] .
Organic mercury compounds such as methylmercury that are fat - soluble and readily cross the blood brain barrier are especially damaging to developing nervous tissues [ 24 , 25 ] .
For example , prenatal exposure as low as 10 mg / kg methylmercury , as measured in maternal hair growing during pregnancy , may adversely affect the development of the fetal brain [ 25 , 26 ] .
Confounding associations and concerns with various stages of brain development related to cumulative early life exposure to mercury include the following sources of mercury : maternal fish consumption during pregnancy , the thimerosal ( sodium ethylmercurithiosalicylate , approximately 49 % mercury weight ) content of certain vaccines and dental amalgam [ 27 ] .
Mercury regulation varies from country to country .
While the US government only regulates methylmercury in fish , several other governments regulate all forms of mercury in all foodstuffs .
In the US , the current action level of 1 μg methylmercury / g fish or seafood was set in 1977 during court proceedings of the United States of American v. Anderson Seafoods , Inc . [ 28 ] .
The data used to determine the action level in fish came from a poisoning incident that occurred in Iraq under Saddam Hussein 's regime in 1971 – 1972 .
There was not a chain of custody for the specimens taken from the victims of that poisoning that were tested by World Health Organization or American researchers , and an appropriate epidemiological study was not undertaken [ 29 ] .
Further risk assessment for methylmercury has been conducted using human data from the massive episodes of mercury poisoning in the tragic Minimata Bay incident in Japan , as well as from large scale epidemiological studies concerning childhood neurodevelopment and neurotoxicity in relation to fetal exposure in various fish eating communities around the world [ 24 , 25 ] .
There has never been a blinded , placebo , controlled study published giving humans mercury or methylmercury , nor would this kind of study be ethically considerable .
Quantitative information on long - term effects of inorganic mercury compounds on humans does not exist [ 30 ] .
Inorganic mercury compounds react with DNA and are clastogenic [ 30 ] .
Because the mechanisms of these reactions remain unknown , it is currently impossible to establish a no adverse - effect - level for mercury in humans .
Sensitive populations such as neonates lacking the ability to efficiently excrete mercury or individuals that retain mercury in their body due to impairments in detoxification pathways may not be protected by any exposure limit .
The implications for mercury in ingested HFCS are not known and clearly more epidemiological and neurotoxicological studies are required .
Decision Betrays Commitment To Transparency And The Rule Of Law
FOR IMEMDIATE RELEASE
CONTACT : ( 212 ) 549-2666 ; media@aclu.org
NEW YORK – The Obama administration announced today that it is reversing its promise to make public photos depicting detainee abuse by U.S. personnel overseas .
The Department of Defense had told a federal judge that it would release a " substantial number " of photos in response to a court ruling in an American Civil Liberties Union Freedom of Information
Act lawsuit .
The following can be attributed to Anthony D. Romero , Executive Director of the ACLU :
" The Obama administration 's adoption of the stonewalling tactics and opaque policies of the Bush administration flies in the face of the president 's stated desire to restore the rule of law , to revive our moral standing in the world and to lead a transparent government .
This decision is particularly disturbing given the Justice Department 's failure to initiate a criminal investigation of torture crimes under the Bush administration .
" It is true that these photos would be disturbing ; the day we are no longer disturbed by such repugnant acts would be a sad one .
In America , every fact and document gets known – whether now or years from now .
And when these photos do see the light of day , the outrage will focus not only on the commission of torture by the Bush administration but on the Obama administration 's complicity in covering them up .
Any outrage related to these photos should be due not to their release but to the very crimes depicted in them .
Only by looking squarely in the mirror , acknowledging the crimes of the past and achieving accountability can we move forward and ensure that these atrocities are not repeated .
" If the Obama administration continues down this path , it will betray not only its promises to the American people , but its commitment to this nation 's most fundamental principles .
President Obama has said we should turn the page , but we cannot do that until we fully learn how this nation veered down the path of criminality and immorality , who allowed that to happen and whose lives were mutilated as a result .
Releasing these photos – as painful as it might be – is a critical step toward that accounting .
The American people deserve no less . "

STOCKHOLM , Sweden , Feb. 19 ( UPI ) --
A majority of Swedes , especially older Swedes , indicated in a recent poll they agreed with the government 's decision not to bail out a struggling automaker .
Among respondents to a recent poll , 20 percent of Swedes over 65 years old indicated the government should bail out Saab , which is owned by U.S. car maker General Motors Corp. , Tidningarnas Telegrambyra reported Thursday .

In the Sifo poll in which 1,000 Swedes were interviewed , 40 percent of the respondents 15 - 20 years old said they thought the government should step in , the news agency said .
A separate poll done by Demoskop found 70 percent of respondents indicated they believed the government should n't offer Saab help .
Neo -conservatives used the Republican Party as a vehicle to promote and employ their policies of muscular nation - building overseas .
But like the parasite that eventually kills its host , the Republican Partys virtual collapse , in large part because of the failed nation - building adventure in Iraq , has left neo -conservatives discredited and facing policy extinction .
Unfortunately , neo - conservatism will probably live on by changing hosts .
Throughout American history , the structure of the political systems has ensured that only two major parties would be viable at any one time .
They havent always been the Democrats and Republicans .
They have always been the Democrats and one other party .
First , it was the Federalists , then the Whigs , and finally , from just prior to the Civil War to the present , the Republicans .
The Republicans started out as a regional party of the Northeast .
The only reason they ever took power away from the Democrats , the only true national party at the time of the Civil War , was because the Democratic Party split into northern and southern wings over the slavery issue .
Thus , the Civil War was essentially caused by the fracture of the Democratic Party .
Abraham Lincoln won the 1860 election with only 39.8 percent of the national popular vote , beating two Democrats and one minor party candidate .
Southern states , fearing a Republicans potential policies on slavery , didnt even wait until Lincolns inauguration before they began to secede from the union .
Ironically , today , the Republican Party , which once had hopes of becoming the majority party in the country , has followed George W. Bush over a cliff and has once again been reduced to largely a regional party of the old South and a few other conservative states .
As long as Democrats in more libertarian mountain states stand up for gun rights , most states in that entire region are ripe for permanent status in the Democratic column .
The most telling moment in the 2008 election was when Arizona , the Republican nominees home state , was too close to call .
It would have gone Democratic had a native son not been running .
If the Republican Party doesnt now move to extinction like its Federalist and Whig predecessors , it is likely to remain only a regional party for a long while .
It s intolerant conservative social views scare most other Americans .
More important , the one issue on which many Republican conservatives differed from President Bush immigration could be the death knell of the party .
When the party alienated Hispanics ( including even some Cubans , who were previously one of the most loyal Republican constituencies ) , the fastest growing minority in the United States , with nativist diatribes on immigration , other minorities , such as Asians and Native Americans realized that they could be victimized too .
In the 1990s , Republican Governor Pete Wilson made California overwhelmingly Democratic with his immigration policies .
The same has just happened at the national level .
After the immigration debate in the late Bush years , it will be hard for the Republican Party to ever woo back Hispanics .
Does the long - term demise ( and maybe extinction ) of the GOP leave the neo-conservatives up the creek without a paddle ?
Not necessarily .
The neo -conservatives started out as liberals and socialists in the Democratic Party .
They were never really that conservative on economic policy , only belligerent in foreign and defense policies .
And in those two latter policy areas , the Democratic Party is still dominated by their close cousins , the liberal Wilsonian interventionists .
Although the liberal Wilsonians such as Hillary Clinton , Richard Holbrooke , and Madeleine Albrightare less unilateralist than the neo-conservatives and are much more in love with international organizations , they share the neo- conservatives  passion for armed social work and nation - building .
Besides , when you re deep in the wilderness and your horse is dying , you cant be too concerned with pimples on your new steed .
The neo - conservatives will probably eventually realize that the Republican Party is dying , and will seamlessly re-infest the Democratic mother ship to preserve themselves .
And again , they will probably severely debilitate their host .
Minister 's fury at Spanish moves to take over Gibraltar waters as Navy ship moves in
Royal Navy warships have forced a an armed Spanish ship to retreat from British waters around Gibraltar .
Relations between the 30,000 residents of the British outpost and mainland Spain have become strained following what the Foreign Office described as ' a violation of British sovereignty ' .
Europe Minister Caroline Flint told the House of Commons that the Government remained ' deeply concerned ' by recent developments in Europe affecting Gibraltar waters .
DISPUTE : Inhabitants are concerned the Spanish authorities want to control the British outpost of Gibraltar
The minister spoke out after the European Commission approved an application to designate the waters around the Rock as a Spanish site under EU nature legislation .
' As the UK is the only member state competent to propose a site covering British Gibraltar Territorial Waters , we do not recognise the validity of the adopted site , ' she said .
' The UK is deeply concerned that Spain should seek to designate an area of BGTW and that this designation should have been approved . '
Britain has made ' written and oral representations ' to Spain on this matter , she said .
Ms Flint continued : ' The [ British ] Government are fully confident of its sovereignty over British Gibraltar Territorial Waters and continues to make this clear to Spain whenever appropriate . '
The warships were dispatched after Spanish ships sent boarding parties to inspect fishing boats in British waters , despite having no authority to do so .
The Rock 's inhabitants fear Spain could damage their economy by making moves to seize control of its sea and air traffic .
The incident on May 8 is the latest in a long series since Britain was handed Gibraltar in the 1713 Treaty of Utrecht .
The Spanish Government has refused to recognise that territorial waters were a part of that agreement and made repeated attempts to reclaim them .
For centuries Gibraltar has been a key strategic base for the Royal Navy .
The latest incident followed a day after Gibraltar 's government vowed to block EU moves to give responsibility for the environment around the Rock to Spain .
A spokesman for Gibraltar 's opposition GSLP / Liberal party said : ' The latest incident is far more serious than anything that has happened before .
It represents a frontal challenge to British sovereignty , jurisdiction and control over Gibraltar 's territorial sea .
' As such the UK must not only respond to Spain , but must also extract guarantees from Madrid that it will never happen again . '
STAND -OFF : The Royal Navy sent warships to see off Spanish vessels which had entered Gibraltar 's waters
The Government said it had made strong protests to Madrid .
A Foreign Office spokesman said : ' It 's a violation of British sovereignty and something we take very seriously indeed .
' We hope they will stop doing it . '
Madrid has not yet reacted .
A week before the latest incident a Spanish launch manned by paramilitary police was sent into Gibraltar 's waters before being seen off by a Royal Navy patrol boat .
The quiet seaside resort town of Weston - super - Mare in Somerset , UK , has been invaded by giant rats that have local pest control officials scrambling to control the outbreak .
Mark Tilley , a 2 Z Pest Control manager says calls to his company about the rat infestation are higher now than at any time in the pas 17 years .
His workers are using any and all means necessary to rid the town of the critters , including shooting them , trapping them and using specially trained dogs to catch them .
One elderly woman was forced to leave her home by the rats and when Tilley and his crew showed up , here ’s what they found :
“ When we first got there everywhere we looked moved .
There were hundreds of them there .
They were running up the trees and everything .
I have never seen anything like it .
I have never seen rats like it before – they were all over the house .
They were absolutely everywhere .
It gave me the creeps and I ’m used to seeing them .
There just seems to be an awful lot more rats about . ”
Another homeowner in the town set up a camera after hearing the rats on his roof and was astonished at watching the rats coming up and looking right into the camera .

After hitting the headlines last year , successful pirate attacks have been on the wane in the early months of 2009 , despite a failed attack on a British cruise ship earlier this month .
Experts disagree about what has led to the reduction , with some suggesting that bad weather had played its part , but Rear Adm .
Terry McKnight of the U.S. Navy attributes the " dramatic " reduction in the number of attacks to the deployment of a British warship , the Royal Navy frigate HMS Northumberland , and the coordinated task force of which she is part .
To wage today 's battles against pirates who took control of 42 ships and captured 815 sailors last year , the Royal Navy is combining machines and methods forged during the Cold War with centuries - old naval warfare skills .
The Royal Navy is also hitting back at pirates by using some of the pirates ' own tricks .
Fighting back
When Northumberland slipped out of Mombasa harbor in southern Kenya at the end of last year , a few reporters and gawkers stood on the banks .
On the deck of the 460 - foot frigate , a smattering of British sailors gazed back .
As far as send - offs go , Northumberland 's was low - key , but the understated nature of the departure belied the importance of her mission .
On that hot December morning , Northumberland — one of just 17 such ships in the Royal Navy — opened up a new front in the unprecedented international war on Somali pirates .
Most of the other warships deployed to fight pirates in the region are concentrated north of Somalia , close to the Suez Canal , through which 10 percent of the world 's sea trade passes .
Northumberland was the first warship on the scene from a new European Union task force , charged with patrolling the southern flank of the 2 - million - square - mile piracy zone , near Mombasa .
It was here that pirates scored their biggest victory last autumn , seizing the supertanker Sirius Star , laden with $ 100 million in crude oil .
Besides Sirius Star , Somali sea bandits hijacked more than 40 large vessels last year , ransoming about 30 of them for a million U.S. dollars or more , according to the United Nations .
Sirius Star was released in January after an estimated $ 3 million ransom was paid , but the other ships , and about 200 crew , remain in pirates ' hands .
The rise in piracy , and consequent rise in the cost of shipping insurance , drove up the cost of shipping petroleum , electronics and food .
Motherships
To beat pirates in potentially violent showdowns , the Navy has adopted the pirates ' tactics of using " mother ships " carrying fast boats to spring on opponents .
In the early days of Somali piracy , in the 1990s , pirates ranged only a few miles from their hometowns and threatened just a few thousand square miles of ocean .
The reason was simple : Most pirates were former fishermen and had only the tools of a typical fishermen .
Their personal firearms and their small , motor - propelled wooden fishing boats , called skiffs .
The skiffs were too slow and too flimsy to catch anything but the most rickety of vessels .
Then the pirates innovated .
They began capturing trawlers and small freighters for use as motherships .
Crewman Juma Mvita , from the Kenyan merchant ship Semlow , discovered this the hard way in 2005 , when about a dozen armed Somalis intercepted his ship .
Mvita said the pirates had no interest in Semlow 's cargo .
Instead , they commandeered the harmless - looking freighter to launch their next attack .
It was more than three months before the pirates released Semlow and her crew .
Today , pirates use motherships for nearly all their attacks .
" What we tend to see happen is a mothership will ... drag along a couple skiffs with it and have probably 10 or 15 , 20 pirates on board , and then they 'll send the skiffs out to go after a merchant vessel , " McKnight said .
He commands a new three - ship , counter - pirate task force .
Warships assigned to piracy patrols rarely engage pirates on their own .
They deploy specialized search - and - seizure teams , which in the Royal Navy consist of marines armed with rifles and machine guns , traveling in raider craft .
It was one such team from the frigate HMS Cumberland that killed three pirates in a firefight last November .
Boarding teams
Boarding teams have been a part of British warship crews for centuries , but in recent years they 've become the best weapon against enemies such as pirates .
The Cumberland 's actions are " bound to have an impact on pirates , " said Capt .
Mike Davis - Marks , a Royal Navy spokesman .
" Now suddenly there 's the threat of death and this may force them to think again . "
Cumberland 's encounter was typical , if still rare in a conflict in which most navies are focused on deterrence rather than active fighting .
A naval engagement with pirates often begins with a commercial ship reporting an attack , using a radio frequency set aside for emergency calls .
Other times , a maritime patrol plane , usually flying from Djibouti , spots a potential mothership or pirate skiff , identifiable not by its appearance , but by its vector .
A trawler speeding away from Somalia , toward a slow - moving tanker ship , just might have hostile intentions .
Digital deconfliction
Naval commanders , in touch with each other by phone , e-mail and satellite network , sort through the roster of warships in the region to figure out who might respond fastest .
They call this " deconfliction . "
When the responding ship is close enough , it launches a helicopter to scout ahead and confirm that the suspect seafarers are indeed armed , while preparing to lower the boarding teams ' boats into the water .
In Cumberland 's case , " the ship 's presence alone was often enough to prevent pirate attacks , " the Ministry of Defense reported .
Beyond that , the helicopter might deter pirates simply by " flying close to demonstrate the aircraft 's machine gun and giving the pirates warning of their serious intentions . "
If the pirates persist , the boarding teams deploy , flanking the pirates ' boats to approach from both sides , moving fast with weapons at the ready .
If the pirates lay down their weapons , they are taken into custody without a shot fired .
If they shoot , the boarding teams fire back , then climb aboard .
The naval network
Deterring an attack , or winning a firefight , requires first that a warship be nearby when pirates strike .
With pirates active on millions of square miles of ocean , blending in with harmless fishing boats , that 's no easy task .
Today on the Indian Ocean there are 20 warships from 14 nations , all of them sent by their governments over the past six months to protect vital shipping from pirates .
Coordinating these ships is key to providing the widest possible protection against pirates .
In the beginning , it was a free - for - all .
" It 's encouraging that everyone is here , " Lt. Nathan Christensen , a U.S. Navy spokesman , said last autumn , " but everyone 's got their own rules of engagement ... their own commanders . "
In time , the naval forces coalesced into four distinct entities plus some odds and ends .
There was the U.S. - dominated Combined Task Forces 150 and 151 , the latter commanded by McKnight .
There was a NATO force sent on a temporary basis , and the EU flotilla intended eventually to replace the NATO one .
On the fringes , there were warships from Russia , India and several other navies , sailing and fighting all on their own .
The four large , multi-ship formations had just one thing in common .
Each one had a British warship assigned : Cumberland with NATO , Northumberland with the EU , the frigate HMS Portland in CTF - 151 and , in CTF - 150 , a rotation of British frigates , destroyers and logistics ships .
That was no accident .
In the last decade , the Royal Navy has mothballed nearly a third of its frigates and destroyers and canceled some new ships and technologies in a bid to save money , but the Royal Navy never cut back on its training and command capabilities .
" Our ships are not necessarily better than those of other navies , " said Capt .
Malcolm Cree , a commander for international naval forces in the Persian Gulf .
" The one thing that we do have , the jewel in the crown of the Royal Navy , is our operational sea training ....
As a result , Royal Navy ships and staffs provide a consistent level of professionalism capability that others know they can rely on . "
It was that professionalism that the EU enlisted when it sent Northumberland to test the pirates ' southern flank in December .
And it was that professionalism that eventually helped tie together the tangle of naval forces threading the Indian Ocean to deter pirates .
By January , some order had been imposed on the chaos .
McKnight 's CTF - 151 and the EU flotilla , under the command of British Rear Adm .
Phillip Jones , were acting as the major nodes in a radio , e-mail and satellite communications network connecting most of the warships in the Indian Ocean .
" My biggest concerns are coordination and deconfliction , " McKnight said .
" It appears that it 's been working pretty fairly in the last couple of months . "
The legal front
As boarding teams engaged pirates in firefights and commanders were sorting out the naval traffic jam in the Indian Ocean , a parallel battle was taking place on dry land .
Late last year , there was " a lack in U.K. law of clear arrest and evidence - gathering powers for Royal Navy officers , " the House of Commons recalled in a report in January .
" If Royal Navy officers were to arrest pirates , there was a real risk that such prosecution would fail on procedural grounds if they were brought back to the U.K. for prosecution . "
That legal loophole is one that pirates have exploited for years .
After two decades of civil war , Somalia has no coast guard and no functional courts , and the only organizations in a position to intercept pirates — the world 's navies — have no clear legal powers .
" The potentials for legal embarrassments are quite numerous , " said Martin Murphy , a piracy analyst at the Centre for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments .
So when they captured pirates , many navies simply deposited them on the nearest Somali beach .
Needless to say , in those cases the pirates probably returned to their lives of crime .
What the world needed was a stable , democratic country in East Africa , with a stake in the piracy fight and the ability to detain , try and jail pirates .
What the world needed , in fact , was Kenya .
The United Kingdom , with close ties to its former colony , was the first to draw Kenya into the counter - piracy coalition in a legal capacity .
Moses Wetang 'ula , the Kenyan foreign minister , and Alan West , the British security minister , met at a piracy conference in Nairobi to initiate the agreement , and none too soon : Eight Somali pirates already were being held in a Kenyan jail , on soft legal grounds , after being captured by a British frigate .
The United States was quick to follow Britain 's example .
In January , the U.S. State Department signed a similar agreement with Kenya .
" The lawyers are at work for the particulars , " McKnight said , " and as soon as we get those mechanisms in place , then we will shift our operation . "
Instead of just reacting to pirates , McKnight 's task force would go on the attack .
Aggressive action can't come too soon .
" Pirates are winning , " Murphy said late last year .
Back off the coast of Mombasa in December , Northumberland made final preparations for her mission .
In the frigate 's scrubbed and polished compartments , sailors calibrated their sensors and fueled up a gray - painted Merlin helicopter .
Royal Marines checked the rifles and kit .
The vessel veered northward , toward Somalia .
" We remain ready , " said Commander M.J. Simpson , Northumberland 's skipper .
If pirates really are less aggressive this year , the world has the Royal Navy , in particular , to thank .
If not , and if this most ancient form of lawlessness continues to sap the global economy , nations will keep looking to the United Kingdom to help fight piracy .

Zoo keepers , park wardens and such stalwart custodians clearly have their patience taxed repeatedly by people who are just plain ignorant and utterly stupid - hence these public warning signs .
Some are just friendly reminders to keep an eye on children , but you ’ve got to wonder why anyone would want to sit on a crocodile .
Obviously people do , and they expect to live !
One Canadian sign shows that humor works wonders when reminding dog owners to clean up after their pets .
In another case , the banana slug crossing sign coupled with the slippery one make for a perfect cautionary pairing .
Like working in your pajamas , greening your home office combines the best of both worlds .
You can build an energy - efficient home in a setting that allows for tax writeoffs , equipment sharing , and upgrades that serve you away from the desk , too .
Here are 12 ways to create an energy - efficient , eco-friendly home office :
1. Put Your Machines to Sleep
A large copy machine takes as many as 1,400 watts of electricity to operate .
Printers , fax machines , desktop computers , and monitors also suck up energy .
Turning machines off when you ’re not using them use saves energy .
Setting your computer to automatically sleep after a short period of time — say , 2 minutes instead of 10 — also helps you conserve .
2. Replace Energy Hogs
If you have n’t updated your office equipment in a number of years , you ’re probably using energy hogs .
They include everything from laser printers , whose quality printouts can be matched by some new inkjet printers , to traditional light bulbs , which lose 95 % of their energy through heat .
Look for equipment with EnergyStar ratings .
Here are a couple of examples :
Energy hog : Incandescent lights .
Replace with : Compact fluorescent light bulbs ( CFLs ) .
Energy hog : Laser printer , fax machine , copy machine .
Replace with :
An all - in - one printer / fax / scanner / copier designed to create high - quality prints , such as the HP Officejet Pro 8500 .
Energy hog : Traditional printer paper .
Replace with : Paper that contains post - consumer recycled waste .
3. Lease or Share Equipment
Renting or sharing equipment with other professionals helps you get the best use — and bang for your buck — out of potential energy hogs like printers , copiers , and computer monitors .
You do n’t have to repair leased equipment yourself , which saves you money .
Sharing equipment , on the other hand , lets you split energy costs with a partner .
4. Bundle
Bundling your purchases can save you money upfront as well as cut down on waste .
Buying software bundles , such as the MacHeist or the Windows 7 Enterprise Bundle , will save you the time , gas , money , and waste it takes to buy software piecemeal .
Moreover , bundles offer discounted upgrades , saving you money in the future , too .
Other useful bundles include Internet - cable - telephone bundles and all - in - one printers .
5. Go Paperless
Paper and packaging are still produce exorbitant amounts of landfill waste .
Luckily , going paperless is easy .
Electronically sign and file your important documents .
Print and photocopy on both sides of the paper .
Print drafts , notes , and memos on scrap paper .
When you must print , purchase printer paper made of post - consumer waste , available online and at chain retailers like OfficeMax .
Recycle the paper you waste .
6. Recycle
This includes recycling plastic , cans , paper , ink cartridges , batteries , used equipment , and even composting .
Some items , like ink cartridges , require special disposal methods .
Devise a system that makes it easy to recycle everything .
Put your can / paper / plastic recycling bins in an easily accessible place .
Leave the recycling bags that come with ink cartridges in an accessible place , so that you ’re ready to mail in cartridges once they run out .
Print out this chart on a piece of scrap paper to remind you where to dispose of batteries .
Set up a composting in a ceramic compost pot indoors or in a bin outside .
7. Green Your Cleaning Supplies
Swap out traditional toxic cleaning supplies for green ones .
Most supermarkets sell brands like Clorox Greenworks http://www.clorox.com/products/overview.php?prod_id=gw, Simple Green , and Seventh Generation .
For quick desktop jobs , green cleaners perform about as well as traditional ones .
8. Audit Your Energy Usage
Audit your home yourself , or call your utilities company for a professional — usually free — one .
Fixing and upgrading air leaks , insulation problems , old light bulbs , and old appliances will shrink energy costs .
9. Weatherize
This usually comes after an energy audit .
Seal your windows during winter .
Open them during summer .
Consider installing energy - efficient ceiling fans instead of using your air conditioner .
Upgrade your insulation .
Buy EnergyStar windows for a tax credit of up to $ 1,500 .
Read here for more weatherizing tips .
10 . Sign Up for Sustainable Energy Sources
Renewable energy credits , wind energy , and home solar systems are a few ways that you can use sustainable energy sources in your own home .
Most major utilities companies have renewable energy programs ; see your company ’s website for more information .
Some alternatives may be costly , but they can reduce your carbon impact by as much as 60 % .
11 . Maintain Your Equipment
It takes little effort to keep home equipment clean and maintained .
Cleaning your computer , printer , and even your portable devices every 6 months will keep the machines running smoothly and save you the possible headache of replacing a fried hard drive .
At home , minor tasks like replacing your furnace filter and cleaning the lint out of your dryer will stop machines from consuming more energy than they need .
12 . Take Advantage of Natural Light
Move your home office to a space with lots of natural light .
This diminishes the need for lamps .
Add houseplants , which naturally clean air , to the mix , and your home office will feel like a green mini-retreat .

B. Kliban is quite possibly my favorite cartoonist , which is saying a lot , frankly .
His ideosynchratic “ drawings ” ( he did n’t always call them cartoons , perhaps rightly so ) are not everyone ’s idea of funny ha- ha cartoons .
Occasionally his work is immensely funny and hits you like a lightning bolt .
At other times you will look at a Kliban drawing in complete bemusement … there ’s something there , something you ca n’t put your finger on that ’s tickling you at the base of your brain , but it ’s not a “ gag cartoon ” in the usual sense .
Some of his cartoons are obvious and just overtly silly , he loved to stoop to outrageously dumb puns ( which I ’ll admit I ’m a sucker for ) ; but some of them are subtle and wonderful to the point of being sublime .
Like Saul Steinberg , who he apparently admired greatly , Kliban explored ideas in his drawings that make you stop and think and perhaps come away looking at the world just a little bit differently .
Some of them are crass ; Kliban was a regular contributor to Playboy for many years ( and elevated the magazine ’s level of cartooning considerably ) and was unafraid to “ draw what he thought ” .
He was also somewhat compelled by the marketplace to make sex a topic more often than he might have in another magazine .
Kliban achieved commercial success and recognition with the publication of his first book of cartoons , Cat .
This is the Kliban that most people know , and cat lovers and cat haters everywhere think of him as a cat cartoonist .
The book is actually quite good and contains some of Kliban ’s more whimsical work , intermixed with actual drawings of his own cats .
His cat drawings are clever and amusing but never “ cute ” in the cloying , saccharine Garfield sense .
Kliban ’s real genius , though , is in a series of “ cartoon ” books published after that , filled with his marvels of weird , “ out of left field ” , “ pick your brain up and give it a twist ” cartoon drawings .
Kliban is essentially responsible for the non-sequiter absurdist style of cartooning that most people think Gary Larson invented with his newspaper panel The Far Side .
( I think Larson would be the first to say so and point to Kliban as a big influence . )
Even more absurd and surreal than Larson , and at times even funnier that Larson at his best ( which is pretty damn good ) , Kliban was a true original and some kind of bizarre artistic genius .
Unfortunately , inexplicably , unforgivably , most of his wonderful books are out of print and have remained out of print for years , even though his Cat calendars continue to be posthumously produced and marketed ( right there that says something about America ) .
However , you may still be able to acquire the books through eBay , aLibris , Amazon or other book search services .
Tiny Footprints , Never Eat Anything Bigger Than Your Head & Other Drawings , Whack Your Porcupine , and Other Drawings , The Biggest Tongue in Tunisia and Other Drawings , Advanced Cartooning and Other Drawings , Luminous animals and other drawings are out of print .
A couple of them remain in print : Two Guys Fooling Around with the Moon is the only one in print of the collections I ’m talking about , CatDreams is a collection of his calendar drawings , and of course , Cat ( Seventeenth Anniversary Edition ) is still available ( and certainly worthwhile ) .
And do n’t get me wrong about the Cat calendars , they ’re pretty cool , just not Kilban at his best and most bizarre .
Here is the official Kliban Cats site ( rather annoyingly done in Flash ) which has a gallery of his postcard and calendar Cat drawings , and the Kliban.com merchandise site .

For anyone who lived and worked in Asia during SARS earlier this decade , here is the lesson learned about disease outbreaks :
No one wants to be Chicken Little , wailing against the falling sky .
But the folks who ignored the warnings , and played down the emerging impact of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome , put their businesses and the safety of their staff at risk .
Roughly 8,000 people caught the disease , about 10 % of them died and a large number of survivors were maimed by frantic , emergency treatments .
The regional economy , ...
Some helpful advice for those planning to retreat and practice the fine art of Zen .
A few years ago , I enrolled in what is called a practice period at the San Francisco Zen Center .
A practice period is defined as a period of time in which one commits to 6 - 9 weeks of daily morning and evening meditation and Wednesday night Sangha talks .
While I highly recommend enrolling in a practice period , a beginner should know the basic rules of a Zen Center before their first day .
I did not do my homework , and as a result , I always seemed to be getting reprimanded for something .
I was like Maria in The Sound of Music , running late for service after experiencing pleasure .
For any soon - to - be Zen students , I ’ve shared my words of advice below .
Hopefully you can avoid hearing the monks break out into song upon your tardy arrival .
1. DON ’T stay up late .

A practice period student must meditate every morning from 5:40 - 6:20 and then again in the evening .
I was working late nights doing sound for bands where the shows did n’t end until 3 or 4 in the morning .
With no time to shower , I ’d stumble out of bed smelling like smoke and alcohol , and have to stay awake for 40 minutes sitting in lotus .
In other words , try and go to bed by 9 pm .
2. DON ’T take the first cup of coffee .
I ’d be the first at the coffee pot before meditation , replacing the pot with my mug so that I could get the first possible sips of coffee .
“ That ’s bad Karma , ” a monk told me one morning .
“ The first drops are the strongest and tastiest . ”
3. DON’T read the New York Times before meditation .
“ How can you have a clear mind if you read the news ? ” a monk asked me one morning when I was caught reading The New York Times before meditation .
4. DON ’T wear strong colors .
The meditation master looked at me disapprovingly when I wore my pink t- shirt with a unicorn on it into the Zendo .
I stood out like a newly formed zit among all the black robes .
5. DON’T bring your cell phone into the meditation room
Even if you turn it on vibrate .
When the Zendo is dead silent and everbody is meditating , the vibration sounds like the rumble of a large earthquake .
1. DO sign up for a practice period at the last minute .
Apparently , because I was the last person to sign up for the practice period , I got the best room .
The San Francisco Zen Center was overbooked , so they had no other choice but to give me Suzuki Roshi ’s room , a renowned Buddhist scholar .
The room was n’t as austere as the other rooms .
It had its own bathroom with a bathtub , a kitchen with a refrigerator , and a balcony that looked over a beautiful courtyard .
It was nicer than my apartment .
2. DO hang out on roof of the Zen Center if you need a break or a cigarette .
Everything that is “ let go ” in the Zen Center thrives on the Zen Center roof ( if it has one ) .
Flowers and plants cover the roof ’s walls , deck and tables , the excess growth from the Japanese flower arrangements assembled by the monks .
Only one or two spartan arrangements make it downstairs , and the rest blooms on the roof in all their unruliness .
Monks that fall prey to their addictions and craving assemble on the roof – smoking monks , sunbathing monks and monks reading Self Matters by Dr. Phil .
3. DO notice your lover ’s shoes so you can see if he ’s sleeping around .
One big rule at the Zen Center is that you ca n’t wear shoes in your room – they must be left outside the door .
Shoes are always shifting around depending upon who is sleeping with whom at the Zen Center .
In fact , a book was just published about promiscuity and the SF Zen Center called Shoes Outside the Door : Desire , Devotion , and Excess at San Francisco Zen Center .
4. DO eat the vegetarian food .
It ’s delicious .
Also , I lost ten pounds without even trying .
5. DO adhere to the meditation schedule .
It is amazing ( and humbling ) to watch many of the exact same thoughts repeat themselves day after day , without progression or variation .
And the point of going to a Zen Center in the first place is to meditate , right ?

Mr Rifkin 's comments met with both support and scepticism at the meeting Economist Jeremy Rifkin galvanised the Research Connections 2009 conference in Prague with a roadmap to simultaneously solve the economic and energy crises .
He proposed a pan-European strategy of small - scale energy generation and smart energy grids that make everyone a partner in energy .
What is more , he said , the plan would create millions of jobs and foster investment that would see the end of the current economic crisis .
Mr Rifkin leads a roundtable of 100 top CEOs and government officials who have subscribed to the plan .
The roundtable is part of the Foundation on Economic Trends , which Mr Rifkin founded .
He said old economic models will not see humanity through , and the combination of the climatic , energy and economic woes of the planet created a " perfect storm " that will see in a new era for its inhabitants .
But such a revolution is not unique to human history , he said .
" The great economic revolutions in history occur when two things happen , " he explained .
" First , we humans change the way we organise the energy of the Earth ; we 've done this frequently over the course of our history .
" Second , and equally important , we change the way we communicate to organise new energy regimes .
When energy revolutions converge with communication revolutions , those are the pivotal points in human history . "
Your building becomes your power plant , just like your computer becomes your information vehicle to the world
Jeremy Rifkin
The current renewable energy push , in common with the information and communication technology revolution that characterised the 1990s , is just such a pairing of regime changes .
But in Mr Rifkin 's grand plan , every citizen of the EU would participate in order to revolutionise the way energy is generated , used , and monetised .
Four pillars
Although the sheer scope of the idea raised eyebrows throughout the room , Mr Rifkin laid out a cogent , four - part plan that he said could in one stroke dispel the perfect storm he described .
The first two pillars of the plan were a call to technological arms : further develop renewable energy technologies ' efficiencies , amplify production to access " economies of scale " , and develop means to store the intermittent energy they harvest .
The third pillar is a common idea writ very large indeed .
He called for a pan-European commitment to microgeneration - small installations of renewable energy technology work in place of , for example , vast wind farms - but on every single building already up or yet to be built .
" We cannot build enough centralised wind and solar parks to run Europe , " he said .
" If this energy is distributed over every square foot all over the world , why would we collect it only at a few points ?
The problem is we 're using 20th century , centralised , top - down business models . "
The large - scale , centralised nature of power generation may be changing Instead , Mr Rifkin suggested overhauling the technology of infrastructure and architecture such that buildings have integral power generation : solar panels and small vertical wind turbines on roofs , heat pumps harvesting geothermal energy in basements .
In rural settings , agricultural waste could be used to generate methane and in coastal regions , tidal power could be harvested .
" Your building becomes your power plant , just like your computer becomes your information vehicle to the world .
Every home , factory , industrial park , every building is converted , " he explained .
While existing buildings could generate a sizeable fraction of their energy demands , new buildings would be " positive power " - generating more than they need through grand changes in building materials and architecture .
Jump - start
Such an idea is not new ; in fact , installations are already underway .
Mr Rifkin cited car maker GM's Opel factory in Zaragoza , Spain , which sports a $ 78 m ( £ 52 m ) solar panel array .
It produces some 10 Megawatts of power , which means the energy savings could pay for the installation in just nine years .
Elsewhere in Spain , Navarra and Aragon have , in the past 10 years , moved to generating 70 % of their energy with renewables .
Using wind turbines in the Pyrenees , hydroelectric generation from snowmelt , and sun-tracking solar arrays , Aragon will be 100 % self - sufficient in six months and be in energy surplus in six more .
" Everyone can do that tomorrow , " Mr Rifkin emphasised .
Moreover , it is a handy way out of an economic abyss .
" If you want to jump - start an economy it 's always about construction .
You jump - start not hundreds of thousands of jobs building solar collectors , but millions of jobs reconverting the entire infrastructure . "
The scale of the proposed changeover is unconvincing for Paul Ekins , professor of energy and environment policy at King 's College London .
" People tend to want power when they demand it and they tend to want it to be there all the time , " he told BBC News .
" It 's certainly possible that microgeneration has a role to play in the future energy system , but my view is that central generation is likely to be a very important part of satisfying that demand . "
' Distributed capitalism '
Each homeowner could become a small player in the European energy market
The fourth pillar of the plan would make everyone a stakeholder in the scheme by overhauling the outdated power grid system .
" We 're going to use the same tecnology that created the internet ; we take the power grid of the EU and turn it into an ' intergrid ' that works just like the internet .
" Say you 're producing 30 % of your energy need , it 's peak period in the middle of the day and you do n't need the electricity .
If millions of people send just a little bit back to the grid , peer - to - peer just like we send information on the internet , that 's distributed power . "
But the distributed computing allowed by the revamped power grid could introduce a new economic paradigm - what Mr Rifkin calls " distributed capitalism " .
" The main grid [ will be ] completely distributed , software connected to sensors connected to every appliance in your home : thermostat , washing machine , toaster , everything .
" At any one time the system will know what every washing machine is doing in Europe .
If you have peak demand , not enough supply , software can say to two million washing machines ' forget the extra rinse ' .
" If you bought the program - it 's all voluntary - you get a cheque at the end of the month or a credit from the electricity company . "
Like microgeneration , the idea of such " smart grids " has been circulating in the energy community for some time .
But it is the sheer scope of all facets of Mr Rifkin 's plan that makes it unique .
He has formed the " Third Industrial Revolution Roundtable " with 100 leaders from industry - big names such as IBM and BASF are on the list - as well as governments to further promote the idea .
And he is sure that the EU will continue to lead the way , citing the " golden goose " of the union : it is the largest internal market economy in the world , making it particularly poised to undertake such an ambitious plan .
Professor Ekins wonders about the likelihood that all the facets such a long - term , high - investment initiative is what the future holds .
" The world has room for visionaries , " he said , " and one of the characteristics of visionaries is that their total vision very rarely comes true .
" Normally the future ends up having some aspect of different competing visions . "

About 150 people have been arrested in a major police crackdown on the Hell 's Angels motorcycle gang in Canada .
Some 1,200 police officers were involved in the operation .
Suspects were also detained in France and the Dominican Republic .
The suspects were picked up as a result of Operation Shark , the culmination of three years ' police work .
The arrests relate to alleged murders and drug crimes that occurred between 1992 and 2009 .
In that period , the Hell 's Angels " biker war " with another Canadian gang , the Rock Machine , peaked .
Of the 156 people the police say have been arrested , 111 are apparently active - so - called " full patch " members of the Hell 's Angels .
' Nowhere to hide '
For decades , Canadian police have contended that members of the biker gang have been involved in alleged criminal and drug activities , organised crime and widespread violence , says the BBC's Lee Carter in Toronto .
No matter where they hide , criminals can be arrested
Inspector Richard Emery
Royal Canadian Mounted Police
Most of the arrests were made in the Montreal area of Quebec .
But police said the fact that some were also carried out in France and the Dominican Republic showed they were sending a strong message to criminal organisations .
" We can go beyond the borders of our country to stop the perpetrators of criminal activity in Canada , " said Inspector Richard Emery from the Royal Canadian Mounted Police .
" No matter where they hide , criminals can be arrested . "
Police say the goal is to put an end to the criminal activities of the Hell 's Angels .
But similar assurances were made after a series of similar raids in Quebec in 2001 , our correspondent says .
If you have ever filled out a form online you have probably encountered a CAPTCHA .
They come in many shapes and sizes .
I am going to detail methods I ’ve used to block bots from taking advantage of forms and their pros and cons .
If you use a technique that ’s not below just comment , the more options the better .
Validating humanness should not be hard , why do some people make it that way ?
reCAPTCHA
Solve a CAPTCHA and help digitize books .
reCAPTCHA is the human extension of a project designed to digitize old textbooks .
While scanning often there is words that the ORC scanner cannot recognize .
These words are then pumped into a central repository where they are randomly displayed on screen for a human to decipher .
Each reCAPTCHA has two words , one known and one unknown .
If you get the known word right it is assumed you got the unknown word correct .
If at least two people get the unknown word correct then it is marked as deciphered .
Simple concept and for a great cause .
The biggest complaint about reCAPTCHA or CAPTCHA in general is the complexity of the images produced , sometimes almost unreadable by humans ( especially if you have used ticketmaster.com ) .
At least reCAPTCHA has the ability to refresh and grab a new pair of words or even read the words aloud .
If you are forced to use a CAPTCHA , reCAPTCHA is your best option in my opinion
The biggest issue in my book with reCAPTCHA is Javascript is required to show the image .
Although most bots do n’t use Javascript neither do some legitimate users .
Not only ones with disabilities but also ones on mobile devices .
Simple Questions
What is 3+2 ?
If you can answer a simple math problem you must be human .
This method relies more on someone comprehending a sentence and placing the right string in the form field .
It can range from simple math to just repeating a word .
It ’s great because the only programming needed is to validate a field is submitted with specific information .
The down side is when someone cannot answer the question .
Making questions too difficult or obscure can result in frustrated users .
Hidden Field
Bots rarely render their forms in a browser so hiding a field with CSS ( or Javascript ) allows you to determine if the form was submitted without being looked at .
Only someone in a browser would not see a specific field , so if that field has content its likely filled in with a bot and you can ignore it .
Bots often fill fields with junk or things that look like text and try to match up the “ name ” attributes with almost valid data so “ first_name ” might result in an actual name .
But they cannot resist a good type = ” text ” field since it allows them a great deal of space to inject HTML or BB code .
Hidden text fields work great with they are type = ” text ” .
Downside of this approach is someone viewing your page with CSS turned off might get confused to see a field with no label just sitting there .
Check Referrer
Did the form submission come from your site ?
If not do you care about its contents ?
After a form is submitted checking where it was submitted from is as easy as $ _SERVER [ ' HTTP_REFERER ' ] with PHP and Request .
ServerVariables ( “ HTTP_REFERER ” ) with ASP ( I think , I despise ASP ) .
Bots often will pull down your form and submit it remotely which creates a blank referrer .
No referrer often means the form was not submitted through your site .
The plus side of this method is the user does not have to do anything extra , the downside is you have to be careful when throwing away data , it might be legitament .
Confirmation Page
Is this information correct ?
A confirmation page is probably one of the best ways to supply a form to a user and verify if they are human while still making them feel comfortable with the information they submitted .
Bots almost certainly do n’t analyze the “ Thank You ” page so if your form goes to a confirm page where they have to click another button to confirm and submit their information it will more than likely not be compromised by a bot .
The only down side to this method is the user has to click a Submit button then a Confirm button , there is a likelihood you loose someone in the middle .
Just Deal With It
You could also do what most people do and just deal with it .
Make sure your data has to go through an approval process before bring posted publicly or sent via email .
This will ensure a human verifies the information on the form was submitted by a human .
Too bad this is the most effective and time consuming option , there is no better way to spot a human than with a human ( currently ) .
Some forms like login ’s do n’t interrupt your daily routine when captured by bots but a full inbox all the time can really get on your nerves .
None of the methods above are foolproof so some spam may still get through but any one of the above is better than nothing .
Do n’t be left with an open form for bots to clog the internet , inbox and databases with .
Lets not forget about accessibility
While all these options are fine and dandy the first two require extra work on your users end .
This throws the red flag to make sure they are accessible .
Opting for an option that does not require any extra work on the users end is best but can lead to a higher spam rate .
Weigh your options and determine which method is best for you , each form is unique and one solution cannot work for all situations .

Changes to North Carolina 's corporate income tax code that are meant to attract Apple to put a $ 1 billion data center in the state have passed both the state Senate and House .
Governor Beverly Perdue is expected to sign the legislation into law without much ado .
The bill is n't specifically tied to any particular company , but it contains a number of conditions that companies must meet to qualify for a significant abatement of state corporate income taxes .
Those conditions include investing $ 1 billion within nine years , locating within North Carolina 's poorest regions , providing health insurance to its workers , offering a minimum working wage standard , and being willing to forgo other tax breaks .
Last week an unnamed official revealed that the changes were specifically targeted at Apple , however .
The company apparently plans to build a large data center on the East Coast and is considering locating in North Carolina .
That center would initially employ about 100 full - time staff members , but would also employ hundreds of workers for more than a year during its construction .
If Apple were to choose to locate in North Carolina , it could receive up to $ 46 million in tax credits over the next decade .
Legislative staffers also estimated it could save Apple $ 300 million if the company operated the data center for 30 years .
The tax code changes are intended to attract employers to the state , which has unemployment rates as high as 15 percent in some areas — nearly double the national average .
Update : As of Wednesday , Apple has officially selected North Carolina as the location for its new data center .
Russian people of Moscow got nice view a few days ago from their windows on the late night skies .

A pesar de que la vida sexual es muy importante para la mayor �a de los mexicanos ( 80 % ) , existen temas poco atendidos y patolog�as poco tratadas , seg�n estudio

By the time homicide Det. Dennis Kilcoyne met with Diane Webb last fall to discuss the maddening search for a serial killer who has stalked South L.A. for decades , he was wide open to suggestions .
Despite more than a year of chasing leads , Kilcoyne and his team of detectives were no closer to catching the man suspected of sexually assaulting and murdering at least 10 young black women .
Webb , who heads a Los Angeles Police Department unit responsible for tracking the whereabouts of sex offenders , suggested a new tack :
Though most of the roughly 5,200 sex offenders registered in Los Angeles comply with a requirement to submit DNA samples to authorities for input into state databases , many have slipped through the cracks .
The officers in Webb ’s group fanned out across the city to track down men who possibly fit the killer ’s profile and to collect DNA samples for comparison to evidence left behind by the killer .
The plan worked .
Just not in the way Kilcoyne had intended .
Advertisement
In late March , the California Department of Justice ’s DNA laboratory jolted LAPD detectives with news that the saliva collected from 72 - year - old John Floyd Thomas Jr. , one of the sex offenders contacted by Webb ’s officers , matched genetic evidence found at the crime scenes of two Los Angeles women raped and killed in the 1970s .
Soon after , Thomas was tied by DNA to three more slayings .
Details from those cases matched dozens of other unsolved murders and rapes .
The women , however , had been older and white , not black and young .
And Thomas ’ DNA did n’t match the man Kilcoyne was hunting .
In looking for one serial killer , the LAPD believes it has stumbled upon another .
The capture of Thomas was one of the biggest by California law enforcement in recent years .
Police suspect he is the “ Westside Rapist ” -- the man who late at night terrorized upscale neighborhoods on the city ’s Westside in the 1970s , breaking silently into the homes of women who lived alone and raping and strangling them .
The violence stopped when Thomas was sent to prison for a rape and started again in Claremont a decade later , shortly after Thomas was released and moved to the area , according to police .
At the time of his release , authorities did not keep DNA databases .
Advertisement
Thomas is scheduled to be arraigned in August on two murder charges .
LAPD Det. Richard Bengston , who is handling the case with his partner , acknowledged in an interview that DNA evidence from several of Thomas ’ other suspected crime scenes is not as definitive , but said he expects the LAPD and the L.A. County Sheriff ’s Department to file additional murder charges .
In addition to the 12 known Westside slayings in the mid-1970s that police say fit Thomas ’ profile , Bengston said his recent review of files from the early part of the decade turned up 15 more suspected cases .
Files from the previous decade will probably contain more , he said .
Because of insufficient evidence , not all will lead to formal charges , but police say they believe they ultimately will be able to close more than 30 homicide cases and dozens of rape cases .
Webb said Thomas had not been a stranger to the LAPD , coming in to a station once a year to register his home address .
It was not immediately clear why he had not already submitted a DNA sample when officers visited him in October and swabbed the inside of his cheek .
Thomas , his former wives and his sons have refused repeated requests to be interviewed .
Bengston , however , said a four - hour interrogation of Thomas offered a glimpse into what allegedly drove him .
Because many of the victims ’ homes had also been burglarized , some had speculated the man responsible had primarily wanted to steal .
Advertisement
“ No , he was sexually motivated , ” Bengston said .
“ It was a sex thing .
He stole things as an afterthought .
. . .
He never came to a full confession , but we got pretty deep into his head . ”
Bengston speculated that Thomas did n’t necessarily intend to kill the women , but frequently did so in an effort to silence them during the attacks .
While the city celebrated Thomas ’ arrest , Kilcoyne and his detective task force continued their search for what had suddenly become the “ other ” serial killer .
“ People were calling for a week afterward congratulating me , ” Kilcoyne said with a laugh .
“ They heard about it and thought we had caught our man .
I had to tell them , ‘ Nope . Different guy . ’ ”
Kilcoyne and his detectives have experienced the disappointment of watching promising leads run into dead ends in recent months .
Det. Bill Fallon and his partner spent several painstaking months tracking down one victim ’s pimp and others who saw her the night she was killed , only to have them cleared by DNA testing .
Det. Paul Coulter traveled to the outskirts of Macon , Ga. , in April to exhume the body of a pastor of the defunct Cosmopolitan Church , which owned a van tied to one of the killings .
He , too , was cleared by genetic tests .
Advertisement
The detectives remain focused on the church , convinced that it and a man who made an anonymous call to police after witnessing the killer drop a victim ’s body out of the van hold the answer to finding their suspect .
Barring that , they have n’t given up hope that he ’ll have a run-in with police and have his DNA profile added to state databases , just like Thomas ’ .
“ Damn , man , you wish it would have hit on ours , ” Coulter said .
“ You just keep working and hopefully we ’ll get a phone call like that someday . ”

With the ongoing development of World of Warcraft , as well as new entries in both the Starcraft and Diablo franchises on the way , it 's safe to say that the folks at Blizzard Entertainment are pretty busy .
However , that has n't stopped the developer from starting work on a new MMO , which it seems will be based on an entirely new intellectual property .
" We 've already stated it 'll be a brand new franchise , " WoW community manager Zarhym posted on the game 's official forum .
" Which means the lore , art , and game play are being developed entirely from scratch .
It 's an overwhelming process , but a process through which we excel .
Our track record supports this . "
However , unsurprisingly , it looks like it will be quite some time before we get any real information on the upcoming game .
Zarhym described it as " a shell of a game , " meaning that it 's most likely still in the very early stages of development .
Be sure to go to the original post and read his entire rant — this is one angry guy .
He rails against rumors , misconceptions about the company , and plans for existing franchises .
I have a feeling the post was written with some heat , and ironically enough we can expect the news he let slip to spread as quickly as the rumors he wrote about .
Fans have often complained of Blizzard treading the same ground with its games , so it 's great to see the developer branching out and creating a new franchise .
But if even a Blizzard - developed MMO can compete with the astounding success of WoW remains to be seen .
Who is probably the only person in the world who can erase a smile off the always good - natured face of [ artist id =" 1233784 " ]
Nick Cannon [ / artist ] ?
One guess .
He 's known as rap 's Mr. No-Holds - Barred : [ artist id = " 502642 " ]
Eminem [ / artist ] .
Cannon has taken major offense to a leaked record from Em's Relapse , " Bagpipes From Baghdad , " in which Em raps about taking [ artist id = " 976 " ]
Mariah Carey [ / artist ] " back " from Nick Cannon .
( Carey has denied Eminem 's claims that they dated for six months . )
" Nick Cannon better back the f--- up , " Em warns the actor / musician on the track .
" I 'm not playing , I want her back , you punk . "
Later in the song , Em leaves a parting salvo : " Nick Cannon , you pr--- , I wish you luck with that f--- in ' whore . "
Cannon had a millions things to say in response on his blog on Friday .
" A mediocre ( at best ) Eminem record that sounds like it was written in 2001 , " Cannon blogged .
" At first , I thought it was old material that had been dug up from when dude ' fantasized ' about having a pretend fling with Mariah .
...
But all of a sudden I hear my name in the verse !
My first reaction was like , ' This is his new sh--?
Wow , that 's too bad . ' "
Cannon said that Eminem 's insults amounted to " racist bigotry . "
" She has had enough difficulty in her life dealing with racial and ethnicity issues , " he wrote .
" Believe it or not , Mariah is the same racial mixture as our beloved president , Barack Obama .
( Black Father + White Mother= BLACK )
" Maybe I 'm going too far , but I thought we got past the days where white men could spew vulgar obscenities at our beautiful queens and get away with it , " Cannon continued .
" What 's next ?
Are we going to let this trash say something horrible about our lovely first lady , Mrs. Michelle Obama ?
Or would Marshall have talked sideways out of his neck like this about Oprah Winfrey ?
This act of racist bigotry cannot go unnoticed .
Calling my wife a ' c ---' and a ' whore ' is way worse than anything Don Imus could have ever said .
So trust , repercussions will be served .
Anybody got Al Sharpton 's number ?!
LOL
Let 's not forget about Eminem 's amateur mixtape rants of calling African Americans 'ni----' and how he hates ' black bi---es . ' "
The actor basically vowed revenge on Slim Shady , joking that he would begin rapping again and threatening comedic retribution .
" So , Miss Marshall , I 'm going to make you wish you never spoke my name and regret the ungodly things you said about my wife , " Cannon continued .
" This is going to be fun !
It 's however you want it !
Just remember , you did this to yourself !
Your legacy has now been tainted from this day forth !
You will now be known as the rapper who lost to corny - ass Nick Cannon ! "
Some business leaders are cozying up with politicians and scientists to demand swift , drastic action on global warming .
This is a new twist on a very old practice : companies using public policy to line their own pockets .
The tight relationship between the groups echoes the relationship among weapons makers , researchers and the U.S. military during the Cold War .

As the EU Observer reports , Information Society Commissioner Viviane Reding has called on President Obama to fully privatize the California based Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers ( ICANN ) , which manages the web address system for the internet , and build a “ multilateral forum for governments to discuss general internet governance policy and security issues . ”
The international group would in turn “ make recommendations ” with regards to global internet governance .
Reding is anticipating the expiration of the ICANN contract with the U.S. Department of Commerce in September of 2009 , calling for a separation of ICANN from its U.S. ties , making ICANN an international organization .
Reding states ,
“ The expiry of the agreement between ICANN and the US government “ opens the door for the full privatisation of ICANN , and it also raises the question of to whom ICANN should be accountable . ”
“ In the long run , it is not defendable that the government department of only one country has oversight of an internet function which is used by hundreds of millions of people in countries all over the world , ” Reding said .
Reding ’s comments provide a window into a wider agenda to transform the internet .
Reding stated in October of 2008 that , “ The Internet of the future will radically change our society . ”
Ultimately , according to Reding , the EU is aiming to “ lead the way ” in the transformation to “ Web 3.0 . ”
Media Kingpin Rupert Murdoch recently announced that “ The current days of the internet will soon be over , ” indicating the establishment ’s move to radically transform the internet away from its current form .
Paul Joseph Watson writes ,
“ The establishment media is dying and advertising revenue has plummeted as people turn to blogs and the alternative media for their news in an environment of corporate lies and spin . ”

Watson continues ,
The corporate media monopoly has terminal cancer and they are losing their power , which is why they are aggressively supporting moves to phase out the old Internet altogether and replace it with “ Internet 2 , ” a highly regulated and controlled electronic Berlin wall , where alternative voices will be silenced and giant corporate propaganda organs will dominate once again . ”
The future of the internet , according to author and “ web critic ” Andrew Keen , will be monitored by “ gatekeepers ” to verify the accuracy of information posted on the web .
The “ Outlook 2009 ” report from the November - December issue of The Futurist reports that ,
“ Internet entrepreneur Andrew Keen believes that the anonymity of today ’s internet 2.0 will give way to a more open internet 3.0 in which third party gatekeepers monitor the information posted on Web sites to verify its accuracy . ”
Keen stated during his early 2008 interview with The Futurist that the internet , in its current form , has undermined mainline media and empowered untrustworthy “ amateurs ” , two trends that he – and the establishment that he represents – wants reversed .
“ Rather than the empowerment of the amateur , Web 3.0 will show the resurgence of the professional , ” states Keen .

McConnell has wanted to dump
Bunning ever since he first met his little Trey
“ Good God , he wants to run everybody , ” Bunning said of McConnell during a conference call with reporters .
Bunning contrasted his 2010 re-election bid with that of Sen. Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania , who last week bolted the Republican Party and joined the Democrats .
“ It is the fact that Arlen Specter is probably as selfish as our leader is in trying to survive , that ’s the only way he thought he would survive in the U.S. Senate , ” Bunning said .
“ Do you know Arlen Specter will be 80 , has had four bouts with cancer and he still wants to run for the U.S. Senate ? ” Bunning continued .
“ And I ’m being criticized at 77 and healthy for wanting to run for the U.S. Senate by certain leadership people in my party .
Give me a break . ”
Asked if the leadership he was referring to was McConnell , Bunning answered : “ Obviously .
Do you want me to spell it out for you ? ”
He said : “ Do you realize that under our dynamic leadership of our leader , we have gone from 55 and probably to 40 ( Senate seats ) in two election cycles , and if the tea leaves that I read are correct , we will wind up with about 36 after this election cycle .
So if leadership means anything , it means you do n’t lose … approximately 19 seats in three election cycles with good leadership . ”
Bunning and McConnell are ideological twins -- they both have ugly zero ratings when you look at how many times they have cooperated with President Obama 's change agenda this year -- but instead of cooperating with each other for the good of Kentucky , they 've been at each other 's throats ever since Bunning detected that McConnell was trying to pressure him into retiring Bunning is widely viewed as unelectable -- his polling numbers are an absolute political death sentence -- and he can't raise money , is an awful campaigner and is a pretty advanced stage of senility .
McConnell desperately wants to hold onto the Kentucky Senate seat so he and NRSC Chair John Cornyn have been strong - arming institutional Republican donors -- the kinds who appreciate Bunning 's 100 % obstructionist record -- into holding back the donations .
At the same time , McConnell has been trying to get Kentucky Secretary of State Trey Grayson , another right - wing douche bag , to administer theto Bunning 's played - out political career with a primary .
Last week McConnell planted stories in the entire hackish Inside the Beltway media that Bunning had decided to retire and had blessed Grayson as his successor .
Bunning said McConell was lying but all the reporters were told by McConnell that Bunning is too senile to remember what he says from minute to minute .
Today Jim Carroll and Joe Gerth reported on Bunning 's latest media conference call and make it clear that Bunning has no intention of stepping aside and that he blames his woes on the detestable Miss McConnell .
On the other hand , Bunning , who has been unable to raise much money , said he would abandon the race if he can't meet his fundraising goals ( and there 's no chance he will ) .
Grayson , on the other hand and with McConnell 's help , is raising money hand over fist .
Remember , though , Bunning publicly declared that if he 's forced out of the race because of McConnell sabotaging his campaign , he would consider retiring early and letting Democratic Governor Steve Beshear name a replacement , the ultimate revenge on McConnell .

証券取引法違反で一審二審とも実刑判決を受け、最高裁に上告中の堀江貴文元ライブドア社長は4月2日、東京・有楽町の日本外国特派員協会で会見を行った。2006年1月23日に逮捕されて以来、堀江氏が公の場で会見を開くのは初めてのこと。その内容を詳細にお伝えする。
日本外国特派員協会での堀江貴文氏の会見
間違った報道による誤解を解きたい
堀江 （英語で）日本外国特派員協会で会見をするのは今回で3回目です。1回目はライブドアの社長として、2回目は衆議院議員候補としてでした。今回は夢にも見ていなかった立場で講演をすることになります。逮捕され、容疑者としてここに立っています。「私はジェットコースターのような人生を生きている」と感じています。
私は未来の経営者や起業家が、ちょっと変わったところのある日本でビジネスをすることを手助けするために『徹底抗戦』という本を書きました。執筆には3年かかり、その中には獄中にいた期間もありました。この機会に、私を支えてくれ、この本を書く勇気をくれた人たちに感謝の言葉を述べたいと思います。後は日本語でお話ししたいと思いますが、よろしいでしょうか？
（日本語で）今日、皆さんにお話したいことはいくつかあるのですが、大きく分けると2つのこと（を話したい）です。1つは「私がかけられている容疑についての詳しいお話」、もう1つは「私にかけられた容疑及び警察からの激しい攻撃など、日本の司法制度に関すること」をお話ししたいと思います。
なぜこのタイミングで『徹底抗戦』という本を出版したいかと思ったのか。私は検察庁に逮捕されてからほとんど皆さんの前に姿を現すことなく、マスコミあるいは検察庁の発表、裁判所の判決などで一方的に私のことをいろいろ言われてきました。しかし、多くの報道は間違った部分が多くて、その誤解をいつか解きたいと思っていました。（『徹底抗戦』を出版するのに）3年もかかってしまったのですが、（3年という時間は）実際に書いている時間というわけではなくて、この本を書ける気持ちになるのにものすごく時間がかかったということです。
まず、ライブドア事件についてお話します。
2006年1月16日、ライブドアのオフィスにいきなり東京地検（の捜査官）が乗り込んできました。その後の報道は皆さんご存じの通りなのですが、そもそもライブドア事件というものが「どういったことを悪いとされて（一審二審で）有罪とされたのか」ということに関して、知らない人が非常に多いのではないかと思います。インターネットや雑誌のコラムなどを見ると、「私がインサイダー取引で捕まった」と思っている人すらいます。インサイダー取引で捕まったのは、私ではなくて村上ファンドの村上（世彰）さんです。それくらい誤解されているということで、正しいことを知ってもらいたい。いろんなマスコミ報道で非常に悪いイメージが（私に）付けられているので、そういったイメージを払拭したいと思いました。インサイダー取引で捕まったわけではありません。

8 Prime Locations to Promote Your Blog ’s RSS Feed – What Are You Missing ?
Every blogger knows that an RSS feed is essential to the success of a blog .
RSS enables readers to stay connected and conveniently view content through other channels like feed readers , email , and mobile phones .
It ’s one of the key features that allows blogs to easily distribute frequently updated content and amass huge followings .
In fact , # of RSS subscriptions has become the measuring stick of success for blogs ( e.g. it ’s weighted heavily in the rankings for IM Top Blogs ) .
As a blogger , you definitely want to maximize your RSS subscriber count to increase exposure and accumulate a loyal following of readers .
If you ’re new to blogging , be sure to sign up for a service called Feedburner ( now owned by Google ) .
The tool allows you to easily manage your RSS feeds and track usage .
You also want to enable the MyBrand feature so that the feed is still hosted on your domain rather than Feedburner’s .
RSS is important and you need to promote your feed to get as many people to sign up .
In this article , I ’ll lay out the prime locations on your blog you should display and advertise your RSS feed on .
If you ’re not utilizing these spots , try them out .
A small change could have a big impact on the number of subscribers .
8 Prime Locations to Promote Your Blog ’s RSS Feed
1. RSS autodiscovery
RSS autodiscovery is a feature that allows web browsers and aggregators to automatically detect a site ’s RSS feed .
It ’s supported by Internet Explorer , Firefox , and Safari and makes it easy for users to subscribe to a feed .
Below is an example for WTW in Firefox .
In order to set this up for your blog , all you have to do is include the following code in the head section of your blog template .
Of course you ’ll need to replace the URL with the address to your own blog feed .
( surround the code with < >)
link rel= " alternate " type=" application / rss+xml " title= " RSS " href = " http://feeds.winningtheweb.com/WinningTheWeb "
Take advantage of browser technology and set your site up for RSS autodiscovery .
It ’s a quick edit but it can lead to a lot of new subscribers .
2. Subscriber count
One of the reasons why Feedburner is so popular is because it allows you to see your subscriber count and compare it to other blogs .
For example , Blog Perfume ’s Feed Analysis tool uses Feedburner data to provide trending and analysis for blogs .
If you have at least a few hundred RSS subscribers , you might want to show your count off on your blog to display your prominence and popularity in a niche .
Social proof is extremely powerful and will get people ’s attention .
The more subscribers you have , the more others will want to join as well .
As you can see here on Winning the Web , I have “ Join X Subscribers ” clearly displayed at the top of my sidebar .
I really like this feature because it stands out , is easily customizable and automatically updates every day .
If you want to implement this on your own blog , Yoast.com has the Feedburner subscription show - off code that will show you how .
Otherwise , you can also opt to use Feedburner ’s built in FeedCount chicklet to dynamically display your feed ’s circulation .
3. Call to action
Most of the time , website visitors need to be guided and told what to do .
Explicit calls to action significantly improve conversion rates .
For example , rather than saying “ here ’s my RSS feed ” , say “ sign up to get free updates to my blog ” .
Calls to action are extremely powerful and will direct your users to the actions you want them to take .
You can see the call to action for my RSS feed at the top of the sidebar – “ Get FREE updates to Winning the Web via RSS or email ” .
Test out different versions and see which of them gets the greatest response .
Willy Franzen used a subtle difference in language and word association to increase his blog subscription rate by 254 % ( hint : he used “ get ” instead of “ subscribe ” ) .
Definitely a must read .
4 . Big orange feed button
You ’ve probably seen this big orange button before , universally recognized on the web for an RSS feed .
Include a big RSS button on your blog above the fold .
Also be sure to make it a link so that your visitors can click on it to subscribe .
A lot of bloggers get fancy with their RSS buttons , creating new shapes , designs , and colors .
For example , check out this collection of unique RSS buttons .
Honestly , I think it ’s better to keep it simple ( orange square ) .
This way , visitors are more likely to recognize the image and subscribe .
5. Email form
Another huge benefit of using Feedburner is that it allows RSS by email .
In other words , visitors can get updates to your blog delivered straight to their inboxes .
This feature is especially important in non-tech related niches because RSS is n’t as widely known or used .
However , everyone knows what email is and interested readers will want to get updates in a format that they ’re comfortable with .
You might even want to create a page that describes RSS and the benefits of subscribing .
Darren Rowse of Problogger has one here – What is RSS ?
Create an email form on your blog and make it easy for people to sign up .
6 . Welcome message before posts
Would n’t it be cool if you could welcome specific visitors based on where they ’re coming from and urge them to subscribe to your RSS feed ?
Thankfully , there ’s a WordPress plugin that does just that .
WP Greet Box allows you to show a different greeting message to your visitors depending on the referrer URL ( e.g. Google , Digg , StumbleUpon , Twitter , etc ) .
This allows for a lot more customization and increases your chances of gaining new subscribers .
I ’ve had a lot of success using the WP Greet Box plugin here on Winning the Web and I always get at least a couple new subscribers everyday from the RSS links .
Right now , the welcome message appears before all of my posts after a few seconds delay .
It ’s very effective and I recommend you install the plugin .
You can see a few example messages below .
7 . Call to action after posts
You should not only insert RSS links in your welcome messages before posts , but you should also include them after your posts .
After all , if your readers like an article , they ’d probably want to sign up to get updates .
You want to make it as easy as possible for them by including a call to action at the end of every post .
Here ’s what I use …
I include the orange RSS button to make the text stand out and include a call to action to subscribe for readers who liked a post .
I also emphasize the fact that updates are free ( people love free ) .
8 . In content links
Finally , you want to include in - content links to your RSS feed where applicable .
This strategy is especially effective because you ’re usually providing people with additional context and incentive to subscribe .
For example , my next article will be about testing and tracking the success of all of these RSS link locations .
You definitely want to subscribe to the RSS feed to get the update .
Do n’t miss out !
Get the idea ?
Bonus Tips for Promoting Your Blog ’s RSS
9 . Include a link to your RSS feed in your signatures – email , newsletters , forums , etc .
10 .
Add your RSS link to guest posts you write on other blogs .
11 . If you have an email newsletter , send out RSS updates to your email list .
I used the Aweber Blog Broadcast feature to increase my subscriber count by 500 overnight .
RSS is probably one of the most important success metrics for your blog .
How are you promoting it ?
Are you utilizing your blog ’s real estate to its full potential ?
In my next article , I ’ll go over how you can test and track each of these positions using Google Analytics .
Based on this intelligence you ’ll then be able to tweak your links and maximize RSS subscriptions to your blog .

Advertisement Pope Benedict XVI has said the suffering of Holocaust victims must never be denied as he visited the Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial in Jerusalem .
" May the names of these victims never perish .
May their suffering never be denied , belittled or forgotten , " he said in the midst of survivors .
The pontiff began his trip to the Holy Land by saying in Tel Aviv that anti-Semitism was totally unacceptable .
He also voiced support for the Palestinians ' right to a homeland .
The Pope 's immediate , forceful and unequivocal condemnation of anti-Semitism in any form and in any part of the world will have pleased his Israeli hosts , the BBC's David Willey reports from Jerusalem .
Wreath for the dead Flying in from Jordan , where he visited a mosque at the weekend , Benedict was greeted by Israeli leaders at Ben Gurion airport near Tel Aviv before being flown to Jerusalem by helicopter .
Tim Franks
BBC News , Jerusalem
Yad Vashem is a place of immense symbolic importance for Jews around the world and , within it , the Hall of Remembrance is one of the most emotion - laden places .
The very fact of the Pope 's visit here carries huge symbolic importance .
His personal history and the long and tortuous history of relations between the Catholic Church and the Jews saw to that .
One Holocaust survivor I spoke to , who was one of the six the Pope was going to shake the hand of , told me she had to think about whether she wanted to meet the man who as a teenager had been a Hitler Youth .
But then she said yes , it was .
His very presence here , she said , was a victory for Israel and against anti-Semitism .
" Sadly , anti-Semitism continues to rear its ugly head in many parts of the world , " he said as Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and President Shimon Peres sat nearby .
" This is totally unacceptable .
Every effort must be made to combat anti-Semitism wherever it is found . "
At the Yad Vashem memorial , where he was flanked by President Peres and other Israeli public figures , Pope Benedict laid a wreath on a stone covering the ashes of people killed in the Holocaust .
He shook the hands of six Holocaust survivors before making a sombre speech about the six million Jews killed .
" They lost their lives , but they will never lose their names , " he said .
" These are indelibly etched in the hearts of their loved ones , their surviving fellow prisoners and all those determined never to allow such an atrocity to disgrace mankind again . "
Pope Benedict , as a child growing up in Nazi Germany , joined the Hitler Youth , as was required of young Germans of the time , but he was not an enthusiastic member .
' Just resolution '
In his arrival speech , the Pope said the eyes of the world were upon the peoples of the Middle East as they struggled to solve conflicts that had caused so much suffering .
POPE IN THE MIDDLE EAST Monday Arrives in Israel , meets President Shimon Peres Tuesday Visits Western Wall , meets Chief Rabbis Wednesday Visits Bethlehem , visits refugees , meets Mahmoud Abbas Thursday Mass in Nazareth , talks with Benjamin Netanyahu , meets Franciscans Friday Meets Orthodox Christian leaders , departs
Itinerary : Israel and West Bank Press operations compete Pope in the Mid East :
The issues
He said : " I plead with all those responsible to explore every possible avenue in the search for a just resolution of the outstanding difficulties so that both people may live in peace in a homeland of their own within secure and internationally recognised borders . "
President Peres said he hoped the pontiff 's visit would help " pave the road to peace " .
Prime Minister Netanyahu has now flown to Egypt , where the idea of a two - state solution will be high on the agenda in talks with President Hosni Mubarak .
Israel 's new prime minister has so far not said if he will support a two - state solution .
Our correspondent , who is travelling with the Pope , says the Catholic Church and the current Israeli government do not see eye - to - eye on Palestinian statehood .
He says the issue will be the main focus of talks between the Pope and the Israeli government over the next few days .
Sheikh Tamimi urged the Pope to condemn the " crimes " of Israel
Some embarrassment arose when the Pope attended an inter - faith meeting with Jews and Muslims after his visit to Yad Vashem .
A Palestinian cleric , Taysir Tamimi , commandeered the microphone and gave an unscheduled speech attacking Israel 's recent war in Gaza and its occupation of the West Bank .
Some in the crowd applauded while others appeared visibly uncomfortable .
The Pope was not seen to react .
Oded Wiener , director general of Israel 's Chief Rabbinate , said afterwards : " Sheikh Tamimi embarrassed the Pope . "
Sacred places
The Pope said Israel and the Vatican had many shared values , including the desire to put religion in its rightful place in society .
HAVE YOUR SAY
As peace loving human beings we should appreciate the Pope 's efforts for reconciliation Usman Javaid , US Apart from celebrating Mass in Jerusalem and Nazareth , Pope Benedict will also visit the most sacred places in Jerusalem for Jews and Muslims .
He will also visit a Palestinian refugee camp close to Bethlehem .
Israel is beefing up security for the trip in an operation named " White Robe " , with tens of thousands of law - enforcement officers deployed and entire sections of Jerusalem to be shut down .
During the previous leg of his tour - a three - day stay in Jordan - the Pope stressed the importance of Christians and Muslims working together .
Analysts say his words are likely to be heavily scrutinised during this week 's trip .

Silvio Berlusconi is “ no stranger to controversy , ” said Barbie Latza Nadeau in The Daily Beast .
But the gaffe - prone Italian prime minister , at 72 , is about to face the biggest threat ever “ to his reputation and personal fortune : divorce court . ”
Berlusconi ’s wife of 19 years , Veronica Lario , 52 , has finally had enough of his “ humiliating shenanigans ” and public philandering .
With no prenup , Lario is likely to get a “ substantial ” slice of Berlusconi ’s $ 9.4 billion fortune .
Fittingly for a media magnate , said Rachel Donadio in The New York Times , the split has “ unfolded almost entirely ” in Italy ’s tabloids .
Lario ’s public call for divorce followed “ days of drama ” in which she criticized Berlusconi ’s “ shamelessly trashy ” choice to run a slate of female TV stars and models for European Parliament and accused him of cavorting with the barely - 18 Noemi Letizia .
( View Berlusconi ’s women , via The Daily Beast )
After a short , “ uncharacteristic silence , ” Berlusconi “ let fly with both barrels , ” said Peter Popham in the London Independent , issuing a point - by - point rebuttal of Lario and accusing her of being duped by leftist newspapers .
The Left has its own ideas :
With few charismatic leaders , many see Lario and her “ unique insider knowledge ” as their best hope to send Berlusconi “ running for cover . ”
One of the questions I find most curious is " why do people continue to do or use things that patently do n't work ? "
There are , of course , societal issues at work when a person is choosing how to respond to events ; however , a naive view would be that as experience accumulates , more effective responses will be acquired .
This is clearly not true in the case of alternative medicine .
Many alternative treatments , from homeopathy to a variety of herbal remedies , have been shown to be ineffective — yet they persist , and , in many cases , have become big business .
To understand why failure can be successful , a group of researchers have put together a mathematical model that accounts for how treatment decisions spread .
This has allowed them to show that ineffective treatments are often more successful in society than efficacious alternatives .
The model is based on the extremely simple idea that , if I am sick , I will choose some action to try and make myself better .
This action may or may not be efficacious , but regardless of that , I will have , in effect , demonstrated that treatment to my associates .
Of course , I will likely recover from illness whether or not the treatment works .
So , independent of the impact of the treatment , some of my associates may choose to use it , since they 're aware that I did and am now well .
There are other details considered in the model , as well .
For instance , treatment may be abandoned , illnesses can either be single events ( e.g. , chicken pox ) or recurring events , and I may continue to demonstrate a treatment after recovery .
Stir this in with a numerical value for the efficacy of the treatment — a scale that encompasses treatments that actually hurt recovery through those that are ineffective and those that are effective — and one can see how a given treatment regime can spread through social learning .
The most ironic finding is that a very effective treatment has only a very short demonstration period , so it 's very unlikely to spread unless the user continues to demonstrate it after they recover .
In fact , if treatment abandonment rates are sufficiently low , harmful practices are the most effective in spreading through a population .
Once recurring illnesses are taken into account , the ground begins to shift towards more efficacious treatments .
However , all of the data shows a broad local maxima of spread located near an efficacy of zero ( e.g. , ineffective treatment ) , meaning that an effective treatment actually needs to be pretty good before it can spread .
There are , of course , other reasons for refusing to use an effective treatment .
For instance , Africa , long exploited by the west , has an understandable mistrust of western practices .
But this is certainly not true in the west , where , for the most part , effective treatment regimes do n't have cultural baggage associated with them .
Nevertheless , large portions of society have turned to various forms of snake oil for treatment , which this model goes some way towards explaining .
It also helps me understand why the meme of vaccine damage has spread .
There are literally no demonstrators for the effectiveness of vaccination , making social learning difficult .

A Taiwanese man became a sitting target for a snake , which bit his penis as he sat on the toilet at his rural home , local media reported today .
" As soon as he sat down , he suddenly felt a knife - like pain and reacted instinctively by standing up , " the China Times said .
" When he looked down , he saw the big snake . "
The 51 - year - old man , from Nantou County , was under medical care with minor injuries , a director at Puli Christian Hospital said .
Download the new Independent Premium app Sharing the full story , not just the headlines
" As soon as he has passed the risk of infection , he can go , " the director , who declined to be named , said .
" A snake 's mouth is n't always clean . "
Local television images showed the black and yellow reptile , reportedly a species of rat snake , being uncoiled and plucked slowly from the toilet bowl .
Snakes regularly enter rural homes in Taiwan and other sub-tropical regions of Asia .
One half of EXO 's detector being constructed in a clean room .
Physicists are used to dealing with rare events and very small quantities , but rarely do they tackle a challenge of the kind facing the Enriched Xenon Observatory , or EXO .
To find what they 're looking for , not only will they try to find a rare event , but to be sure they will need to find a single barium atom in the 10 ton bath of liquid xenon -- 1028 atoms .
The EXO collaboration , involving SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory , Stanford University , and many other partners , is looking for a never - before - observed process called neutrinoless double beta decay .
In their case , this means watching for an isotope of xenon decaying into barium , giving off two electrons ( the double beta decay ) , but without giving out any neutrinos .
A beta decay process gives off one neutrino , so how could this even be possible ?
It only works if the neutrino is its own antiparticle , so that the two beta decays each have a neutrino which essentially cancel each other out , like matter and antimatter annihilating .
And the possibility that process exists is the reason for the experiment .
If neutrinoless double beta decay is observed , it means the neutrino must be its own antiparticle , a key unknown in the study of neutrinos .
If the neutrino is indeed its own antiparticle , it has all kinds of implications for the structure of the Standard Model and the relationships between the fundamental particles .
The EXO experiment
EXO - 200 , the first version of the experiment , involves 200 kg of enriched xenon in an ultra-clean tank with light and electrical sensors that would detect the decay of xenon into barium .
Steven Herrin of SLAC referred during the American Physical Society meeting in Denver , Colorado to the xenon as " the largest non-weapons based isotopically enriched stockpile in the world of any element . "
Herrin said that the whole experiment is to be transported from Stanford University in northern California to the Department of Energy 's Waste Isolation Pilot Plant in Carlsbad , New Mexico in June or July .
The experiment is being installed 2000 feet underground in clean rooms at WIPP , a salt bed well suited to radioactive shielding .
A technical run will begin in the late summer or autumn this year , with scientific data taking starting before the end of 2009 .
A later version of EXO would include perhaps 10 times as much xenon and would be correspondingly more sensitive to the very rare neutrinoless double beta decay , if it exists at all .
Avoiding false alarms
Detecting a rare process like neutrinoless double beta decay is particularly challenging because it involves looking for a signal that occurs rarely but happens in an environment prone to generating false signals , called background .
The very low - level but inherent radioactive decay of the experiment 's equipment , combined with the chance of random cosmic rays hitting the apparatus all could give rise to signals that could be confused for the signal physicists are seeking .
The experiment is being placed underground to help avoid the effects of cosmic rays , and the materials from which the apparatus is made are all specially prepared to avoid the low - level radiation that essentially all materials naturally emit .
But even cutting down the background to as low a level as possible is n't ideal and experience with other related experiments trying to directly detect dark matter have shown that the major issue is dealing with these backgrounds .
The EXO team has an ambitious plan to try to make the backgrounds completely irrelevant , with no chance of them causing a false alarm .
It requires finding the barium ion that is created when the xenon decays .
As graduate student Brian Mong from Colorado State University understated , " Detecting a single barium ion in 1028 xenon atoms is a unique challenge . "
If the barium ion can be found and its creation matched to the time of the xenon emitting its two electrons , physicists can be sure that double beta decay really happened .
But where do they begin ?
Finding the needle
Mong described his graduate work on a process for detecting the barium ion .
His is one of three different approaches being developed to try to find the barium .
None of these will be ready for the EXO - 200 experiment , but collaborators hope one of them will work well enough to implement in a larger - scale version of EXO .
Mong 's approach is to feed an optical fiber into the liquid xenon and , using a small cryogenic system at the end of the fiber , freezing a sample of the xenon , which might include the barium ion .
The barium ion would be trapped at the end of the fiber , where its existence could be confirmed .
The team is still unsure how they will trap the barium ion .
The barium ion could be pushed toward the fiber using electric fields , or perhaps the fiber could be inserted on a probe into the middle of the xenon at the place identified by the flashes of light that will accompany the xenon decay .
That is a problem for later and Mong is currently concentrating on getting the identification to work .
The basic principle for identification is that laser light of a specific frequency tuned to the properties of barium will be shone into the optical fiber .
The light would hit the barium ion , if present , and the barium would absorb the light and then fluoresce , or re-emit some of it back toward the fiber .
The light going back into the fiber could be detected and the existence of the barium confirmed .
Mong has a prototype of the equipment built and to test it , he is using a fluorescent dye called rhodamine 6G .
He diluted some rhodamine many times over until there should have been about 100 molecules in the test tank .
The fiber and laser system was able to very clearly identify the presence of the molecules showing the technique works in principle .
In what might be the closest physics has ever come to homeopathy , the next step was to dilute the sample even further until he expected to have only one molecule in the test tank .
In a series of tests , he was able to extract a signal corresponding to the presence of a molecule , while tests with samples containing no rhodamine came up empty as expected .
Although the technique is not foolproof yet -- there were a couple or results that did n't work which Mong fears might have come from two samples being confused -- it shows promise for actually finding that elusive barium ion when xenon decays .
The technique will be re-tested over the summer with many more samples .
Finding a single barium ion in the pool of xenon would be one of the most difficult detections of a single atom yet performed , but the payoff is enormous .
It would bypass the problem of backgrounds and the kind of controversy that they have caused in related dark matter experiments .
Are the neutrino and antineutrino the same ?
Even with detection of barium operating well , the physicists will still need to see what nature has in store for them .
There is no doubt that barium will be created , as the xenon isotope being used will definitely decay .
But whether it decays only emitting neutrinos , or whether it also decays with no neutrinos must be disentangled .
The trouble is that the neutrinos are invisible to the detector .
All that physicists have to work with is the energies of the electrons that are emitted during the decay of xenon to barium .
Instruments will be able to determine the energies of the electrons with about one percent precision .
There is a maximum amount of energy that the electrons could carry away from the decay .
But some of the energy would go into neutrinos if they are created .
That means the energy spectrum of the electrons should be spread out over a wide range depending on just how much energy the neutrinos take with them .
If there is neutrinoless double beta decay , all of the energy goes into the electrons and that should form a spike of detections at the maximum energy .
Physicists are confident that their equipment will be sensitive enough to resolve whether that spike exists .
If it does , physicists will know definitively that the neutrino is its own antiparticle .
If the experiment has been running long enough and no such spike appears , physicists can be quite confident that the neutrino and the antineutrino are different particles .
The longer the experiment runs , the more confident they will be .
Either way , with the system working and a little time , it should provide a key piece of the puzzle surrounding neutrinos , perhaps the least understood particles physicists have ever detected .
I always thought text messages were limited to 160 measly characters because of some archaic pre-1970s technical standard .
But apparently , it 's because some German dude thought 160 was " perfectly sufficient . "

Friedham Hillebrand was a communications researcher who was working with a group on developing a standard for cellphones to send and receive text messages .
So he sat down on his typewriter and banged out a bunch of random sentences and questions , counted up the number of characters it took , and decided 160 was the magic number .
I 'm actually somewhat curious as to how an old German dude would 've come up with messages that short in the days before ROFLcopters swarmed in the sky .
Anyways , as chairman of GSM 's nonvoice services committee he came up with the idea of backdooring the messages in the radio channels phone already used to figure out reception stength — which initially limited them to 128 characters , not the 160 Hillebrand had decided was perfect .
After some serious tweaking , they raised the limit 160 characters .
Then he forced every carrier to support SMS , or die in a fiery fire of doomy doom .

Preparedness .
There is perhaps no other word that conveys so much , yet so little .
What does it mean ?
To what areas of life does it apply ( or not apply ) ?
Being adequately and generally prepared of a necessity requires that we ask ourselves all sorts of questions , plan for various scenarios , and abstract our preparations enough such that they can apply to various circumstances , if possible .
For example , having a lot of food stored will help you if there ’s an earthquake , fire , flood , unemployment , famine , etc .
So , this preparedness item is quite versatile in its applicability and usefulness .
Other , more specific items , such as a portable toilet or potassium iodide tablets , fill a much smaller niche and ca n’t be used for too many situations other than the ones they ’re intended for .
Yet , they ’re all important .
Preparedness in this context means acquiring the knowledge , skills , and physical possessions that would enable you to comfortably survive whatever may come our way .
In most cases , external circumstances outside of your control dictate what you must go through , and thus you cannot reliably foresee what will happen .
So , preparing for the unknown can be daunting , but it is by no means impossible .
The following list of ten items illustrate various scenarios and circumstances for which we should all be prepared .
As you read this list , do not become alarmed , frustrated , or fearful .
The information shared below is not intended to elicit any of these emotions .
Rather , you should explore the various scenarios with an open mind willing to make whatever changes necessary to become prepared for that potential event .
Take them one at a time , consider what you need to do in your own life to be better prepared in that area , and make an action plan .
Do not let this list , or your own preparedness plan , overwhelm you to the point of inaction !
I fear that too many people would rather die before “ anything really bad happens ” .
While I understand why some people might feel this way , I strongly disagree .
Crises provide opportunities for service , leadership , inspiration , and love .
You may never be more needed in your life than at a time when others around you look to you for assistance .
In such experiences , you can fill a critical need and be a great help to those who need you .
I fully intend to survive whatever the future holds , and so should you .
With that , I present the following list of possible scenarios for which we should all be prepared .
They are listed in no specific order , and are by no means comprehensive .
Pandemic .
The world recently narrowly averted a potentially massive pandemic outbreak , and yet few are even aware .
The media is n’t reporting it , but that ’s little surprise .
The LDS Church has placed emphasis on preparing for this scenario with some instructional materials .
The question you need to ask is this : if a pandemic broke out in America today , am I prepared to self - quarantine in my home for the next three months ?
Do I have three months ’ worth of food , water , waste disposal , medicine , supplies , savings to pay the bills , etc . ?
Economic Collapse .
The headlines are scary to ponder these days , and our situation is in many ways grim .
Much is being promoted by the various governments of the world to stave off depression , but the truth is that our economic house of cards is built on a sandy foundation .
Whether it ’s next week or in five years , there will be severe economic problems felt by every individual in the world .
People have already lost their life savings , banks are closing their doors weekly , the value of the dollar is eroding , and the market is fearful of what the government is trying to do .
The questions you need to ask are : how much savings can I build up ?
In my situation would it be wise to pre-pay certain bills ?
Should I diversify out of the dollar into gold or silver ?
How would I meet my basic needs and those of my family if an economic collapse occurs ?
Martial Law .
This sounds like something out of the movies or dystopian fiction , but it ’s a very real possibility .
As the economy worsens , there will be increasing civil unrest .
Recently released documents from George Bush ’s administration show that it had arrogantly ( and un-Constitutionally ) granted itself power to use the military inside the country ’s borders to subdue and detain American citizens , free from any Constitutional checks or Posse Comitatus ’ restraint .
The groundwork for martial law has been in the process for some time , and its likelihood in the event of an “ emergency ” ( whether real or contrived ) is quite high .
Even without using the military , our cities ’ police departments have become highly militarized themselves .
The question you need to ask is : do I have a personal plan tailored to my unique situation and location for surviving and escaping the heavy hand of martial law ?
Am I aware of my Constitutional rights , and taking steps to cement and preserve them now ?
War , Terrorism , and Chaos — Inside Our Borders .
Scared of Iraq ?
According to a military affairs website , Mexico poses a greater threat to our national security than do terrorist factions on the other side of the world .
With stories like these , that ’s not a surprising statement .
And as the chaos creeps closer to our borders ; as it festers from within as a result of a tanking economy ; as unemployment and entitlement claims rise ; as state budgets suffer , hand out IOUs to citizens , and cut spending in sensitive social programs ; and in numerous other circumstances that might incite protest and rebellion , the violent actions summarized on nightly news broadcasts may soon become overwhelmingly repetitive .
You need to ask yourself : do I have the ability to protect my family from gangs or those who are desperate and violent ?
Do I have a community of friends and family to survive with ( strength in numbers ) ?
What supplies should I acquire and what measures should I take now to create an environment of stability and safety later ?
Earthquake , Tsunami , Volcano .
We live on the Earth at its mercy .
At any time , she can erupt , shake , and cause us to feel her presence to our physical detriment .
This especially hits close to home for those of us ( in Utah and California especially ) who live on a prominent earthquake fault , or who live near the ocean , close to a volcano , or in an environment known for other severe natural disasters ( hurricanes , fires , floods , etc. ) .
Ask yourself :
Do I have an emergency route and an emergency vehicle ?
Have I established a place of refuge to which I can flee , should it become necessary ?
Do I have basic survival skills and supplies necessary to survive on foot as I travel away from disaster ?
Do I have a communications and evacuation plan to reunite with my family in the event of a disaster , should we be apart at the time ?
Nuclear .
At the switch of a button , entire cities can vanish in a nuclear assault .
The nations of the world have plenty of these weapons stockpiled , and frayed diplomatic relations and aggressive posturing may one day lead to a nuclear assault of varying proportions .
You must ask yourself : do I live in a major city ?
If a nuclear event occurred within 300 miles of my home , do I have sufficient Potassium Iodide for all those I want to help ?
Do I have a safe shelter to avoid radiation ?
Do I know how to shield myself from fallout and how long I need to shelter in place ?
Have I acquired the knowledge necessary to survive a nuclear blast ?
Food and Water Shortage .
Nations throughout the world are already suffering from severe famine and a decrease in food production .
As the economy is factored in and its effects are felt , the number of people suffering for want of food and clean water will increase .
You should be asking : do I have at least one year of food and water stored , especially basic staples that can be stored in bulk for a long time ?
If my current water supply was cut off or contaminated , how would I get water ?
What items can I store that would be used in a barter situation , or which I could freely give to others that might be in need , yet still be able to provide for my family ’s needs ?
Communication Termination .
Our communication network is vast , and yet very fragile .
An EMP attack , strategic missile attack , or other similar assault could easily take down parts or our entire communication infrastructure in this country .
You should ask yourself : do I have an emergency plan for my family that will allow us to communicate between ourselves and others as necessary ?
Do I own and know how to use a HAM radio , GMRS walkie talkies , and other communication devices that may allow me to access news , pass along important information , and otherwise be of assistance in the event we are unable to do so through conventional means ?
Discord and Division .
As world events escalate in how they are individually felt , people will look for someone to save them from their problems .
Some look to government , others to God , others to themselves , and others to the tempting stash of goodies in their neighbors ’ basement .
The Bible talks of division amongst families , and Christian people are aware of the prophecies relating to apostasy and the separation of the wheat and tares to happen in a future day .
Whether in a religious context or that of families dividing because of politics or personal decisions , ask yourself : am I prepared for drama , shock , and heartache as those I love and care about may turn against previous affiliations and reject who I am and what I stand for ?
Am I spiritually in tune and able to receive the necessary personal revelation to stay the course , regardless of what others ’ decide , and how many may follow that path ?
Am I firmly planted on the rock of Christ to prevent my being buffeted about by others ’ actions , decisions , and invitations ?
Tent City and Places of Refuge .
As a result of foreclosure and economic trouble , tent cities have been popping up in various cities for some time now .
Authorities in Sacramento , CA , now estimate that 1,200 people are living in a tent city there , trying to cope with the hand that they ’ve been dealt , and get back on their feet .
Some believe that future tent cities will be places of refuge from a decaying world where the faithful can gather .
But whether you go on an extended camping trip out of necessity or invitation , you should ask : do I have the resources necessary in order to do so ?
If , for whatever reason , I had to leave the comfort of my home and live in the outdoors for an extended period of time , what would I bring ?
How would I stay warm ?
What would I use for shelter ?
Now take a deep breath .
I , as much as anybody , hope that none of these things ever happen .
But looking over history and closely following current events , the sad reality is that the potential for each is surprisingly high .
We must be prepared , and ready to help ourselves , our family , and those around us .
Doing so requires mapping out our current plan ’s weak points , assessing in what ways our supply of items is deficient , and making an actionable to - do list of things we will work on both in the short and long term .
It ’s a lot of work , yes .
But as conditions worsen around us , those who have prepared will , like the five wise virgins in Christ ’s parable , be ready for the future and able to continue moving ahead in their life .
As a young Scout , I learned the motto “ Be Prepared ” .
But in my young teenager mind , I had no idea that those two short words entailed so much !
Now that I am responsible for a family of my own , my firm determination is to survive whatever may come our way , and ( hopefully ) comfortably !
I hope you ’ll work towards the same goal .

Rakudo rocks , it has many cool and convenient features - but it also has its rough edges .
Some things really need improvements .
The Rakudo developers know about these , but by shedding a light on these edges I hope that I motivate people to work on them , as well as giving fellow Rakudo users the feeling that they are not alone with their woes .
Here they are :
Missing line numbers in error messages
Ca n't initialize attributes in BUILD methods
Performance
The first one is pretty obvious :
While parse errors show a line number in the error message , other compile time errors and parse errors do n't .
When debugging a larger application that 's really a pain .
I 've been told that this is very close to being implemented , and maybe it is at the time I get this blog post published , so here is hope .
If you 've only toyed around with Rakudo a bit , you might not have hit the second item on my list .
Perl 6 has a rather sophisticated object model , and Rakudo implements large parts of it .
But in larger applications it still feels a bit hacky because you can't use the BUILD submethod to set up attributes , it dies with a Null PMC access .
Therefore one has to revert to custom init methods , and is always in danger of forgetting to call it .
Performance again is very obvious : Rakudo has a startup time of nearly a second , and both execution and compilation is very slow .
Thanks to module precompilation it is somewhat manageable in bigger projects , but it 's still something that needs improvement .
Thankfully Allison Randal is reworking the calling conventions in Parrot , and we can hope for some speedup there .
There are other things that could use some polishing , but which seem of somewhat lower priority to me :
NEW DELHI ( Reuters ) - Indian mobile operators added a record 15.64 million customers in March , helped by the expansion of networks to smaller towns and rural areas , data from the telecoms regulator showed .
The mobile subscriber base in the world ’s fastest - growing wireless market rose by 50 percent , or more than 130 million , to 391.8 million in the 12 months ended March , the Telecom Regulatory Authority of India said .
India is the second - biggest market for wireless services , lagging only China which has more than 600 million users .
Indian operators had added 15.41 million customers in January and 13.45 million users in February .
The country also had about 38 million fixed - line subscribers at end -March .
Time and Space Tradeoffs in Version Control Storage
Storage is one of the most difficult challenges for a version control system .
For every file , we must store every version that has ever existed .
The logical size of a version control repository never shrinks .
It just keeps growing and growing , and every old version needs to remain available .
So , what is the best way to store every version of everything ?
As we look for the right scheme , let 's remember three things we consider to be important :
Data integrity is paramount .
In a version control tool , nothing can be considered to be more important than guarding the safety of the data .
Performance is critical .
Software developers have about as much patience as a German Shepherd sitting in front of a pot roast .
Space matters too .
We 're going to be storing lots of data , much of which is being kept almost entirely for the purpose of archiving history .
We 'd prefer to keep this archive as compact as possible .
In this blog entry I will report the results of some exploration I 've been doing .
I am experimenting with different ways of storing the full history of one source code file .
In this case , the file comes from the source code for SourceGear Vault .
It has been regularly edited for almost seven years .
There are 508 versions of this file .
As I describe the various things I have tried , a running theme will be the classic tradeoff of space vs. speed .
In physics , we know that matter and energy are interchangeable .
In computer science , we know that time and space are interchangeable .
Usually , we can find a way to make things faster by using more space , or make things smaller by taking more time .
As I said , I 'll be storing 508 versions of the same file .
It 's a C# source code file .
For each attempt , I will report two things :
The total amount of space required to store all 508 versions .
The total amount of time required to retrieve ( or decompress or decode ) all 508 versions , one at a time .
Before we get started , a few caveats :
I realize that these experiments would yield different results for a different kind of file .
If you 're storing source code , there might be some things here you can apply .
If you 're storing JPEG images , not so much .
All these experiments were done on my Mac Book Pro laptop .
The CPU is a Core 2 Duo , which I consider to be decently fast .
But like most laptops , this machine has an I / O system which I consider to be quasi-crappy .
I would probably get somewhat different results if I were running on a more serious piece of hardware .
OK , how should we store these 508 versions of the file ?
No compression at all
As a first attempt , let 's just store them .
No compression or funky encoding .
Each of the 508 versions will be stored in full and uncompressed form .
This is the starting point , even if it is not very practical .
Size : 112,643 KB
Time : 2.5 s
#ifdef DIGRESSION
Yes , dear reader , I admit that this file is far too long .
You can do the math .
If the archive takes 112 MB and there are 508 versions , then each one is 230 KB .
That 's pretty big for a source code file .
Actually , it 's worse than you think .
The 230 KB figure is just the average .
The first version of the file is around 90 KB .
The latest version is over 400 KB .
In our defense , I 'd like to point out that this piece of code needs to stay compatible with .
NET 1.1 , so the entire class must be in a single file .
However , I 'd still have to answer to the charge of " First Degree Failure to Refactor " .
Fine .
I 'll have my attorney contact you to plead out on a lesser charge .
I 'm thinking maybe " Third Degree Contributing to the Delinquency of an Intern " , or something like that .
#endif
This " full and uncompressed " format uses an awful lot of space , but it is also the fastest .
We will find ways of making this smaller , but all of those ways will be slower .
The relevant questions are :
How much smaller ?
How much slower ?
Some solutions will allow us to make this a lot smaller and only a little slower .
Those are interesting .
Other possibilities will be only a little smaller but a lot slower .
Those are not so interesting .
Simple compression
OK , for our next idea , let 's just compress every version with zlib .
Size : 22,516 KB
Time : 4.0 sec
The results of this idea are surprisingly impressive .
The archive is over 80 % smaller , and only about 60 % slower .
That 's darn good , considering that I did n't have to be terribly clever .
This tradeoff is probably worth it .
In fact , it establishes a new baseline that might be tough to beat .
How do we get better than this ?
Deltas
Instead of just compressing every file independently , we could store things as deltas .
Think of a delta as simply the difference between one version and the next .
Compression with zlib takes one standalone thing and makes an equivalent standalone thing which is smaller .
In contrast , a delta is a representation of the differences between two files .
Suppose that somebody takes file X and makes a few changes to it , resulting in file Y .
With a delta algorithm , we could calculate the delta between X and Y , and call it D .
Then , instead of storing Y , we can store D .
The nice thing here is that D will be approximately the size of the edits , regardless of the size of the two files .
If X was a 100 MB file and Y was the same file with an extra 50 bytes appended to the end , then D will be somewhere around 50 bytes ,
A delta is a concept which might be implemented in a lot of different ways .
In my case , the delta algorithm I am using is VCDIFF , which is described in RFC 3284 .
We have our own implementation of VCDIFF .
Other implementations include xdelta and open- vcdiff .
The important thing to remember about deltas for storage is that you must have the reference item .
D is a representation of Y , but only if you have X handy .
X is the reference .
OK , it should be obvious that this concept can be helpful in storing a repository , but how do we set things up ?
One big delta chain
As a first attempt , let 's store all 508 versions as a big chain of deltas .
Every version is stored as a delta against the version just before it .
Version 1 is the reference , and is the only version that is not stored as a delta .
Size : 7,682 KB
Time :
Way too long to wait
Wow -- this is really small .
It 's over 93 % smaller than the full / uncompressed form .
It 'll be hard to find a general purpose approach that is smaller than this .
But good grief this is slow .
Fetching version 508 takes an eternity , because first you have to construct a temporary version of 507 .
And to construct version 507 , you first have to construct a temporary version of 506 .
And so on .
Key frames
Let 's try something else .
The problem with the chaining case above is that retrieving version 508 requires us to go all the way back to version 1 , which is incredibly inefficient .
Instead , let 's insert " key frames " every 10 versions .
We borrow this idea from the video world where compressed video streams store every frame as a delta , but every 10 seconds they insert a full , uncompressed frame of video .
By using key frames with chaining deltas , we can cut the time required to fetch the average version of the file .
For example , with a key frame every 10 versions , we get most of the benefits of chaining , but in the worst case , we only need 9 delta operations to retrieve any version .
Size : 18,024 KB
Time : 41.0 sec
This is better , but still not very good .
The compression here is n't much better than zlib , and the perf is still a lot worse .
Compared to zlib , we do n't want to pay a 10 x speed penalty just to get 20 % better compression .
All the key frames are stored as full and uncompressed files , and they 're taking up a lot of space .
Maybe we should zlib those key frames ?
Size : 9,092 KB
Time : 42.7 sec
Now at least the compression is starting to look interesting .
This is less than half the size of the zlib case , and 91.9 % smaller than the full form , which is a level of compression that is probably worth the trouble .
But the overall perf is still quite slow .
In fact , it 's even slower here than plain chaining with key frames , because we have to un -zlib the key frame .
Flowers
The big problem here is that chains of deltas are killing our performance .
Chained deltas can be used to make things very small because each delta matches up nicely with one set of user edits .
But chained deltas are slow because we need multiple operations to retrieve a given file .
Another approach would be to use each reference for more than one delta .
I call this the flower approach .
With a flower , we deltify a line of versions by picking one version ( say , the first one ) and using it as the reference to make all the others into deltas .
Flower deltas should be much faster , since any file can be reconstructed with just one undeltify operation .
So let 's try to flower all 508 versions using version 1 as the reference for all of them .
Size : 35,851 KB
Time : 10.9 sec
As expected , the performance here is much better .
But the overall space savings is lousy .
Only version 2 was based directly on version 1 .
Every version after that has less and less in common with version 1 , so the delta algorithm can't draw as much stuff from the reference .
This particular approach is n't going to win .
Plain zlib is both smaller and faster .
Flowers with key frames
Maybe we should try the flower concept with key frames ?
Like before , every 10 frames go together as a group .
But instead of chaining , we 're going to run each group as a flower .
The first version in the group will serve as the reference for the other 9 .
We can reasonably assume that the deltification of frame 10 wo n't be as good as frame 2 , but hopefully 10 and 1 still have enough in common to be worthwhile .
Size : 18,648 KB
Time : 12.2 sec
Wow .
This looks a lot better than chaining .
The space used is about 17 % smaller than zlib , but instead of being 10 times slower , it 's only 3 times slower .
Of course , we can use the same trick we tried before .
Let 's zlib all those key frames .
Size : 9,716 KB
Time : 13.6 sec
This seems like a potentially useful spot .
It 's less than half the size of zlib .
The perf still a lot slower than zlib , but at only about 3X slower , the tradeoff is the best we 've seen so far .
OK .
So we 've made a lot of progress on saving space , but 3X slower than zlib still seems like a high price to pay .
Do we really want to make that trade ?
Do we have to ?
Some things get retrieved more often than others
Let 's look at the patterns for how this data is going to be accessed .
I 've been reporting the total time required to fetch all 508 versions of the file .
However , this benchmark does n't reflect real usage very well at all .
In practice , the recent stuff gets retrieved a LOT more often than the older stuff .
Most of the time , developers are updating their working copy to whatever is latest .
As a rough guess , I 'm going to say that version 508 gets retrieved twice as often as 507 , which gets retrieved twice as often as 506 , and so on .
A timing test based on that assumption gives us results something like this :
Full 1.1 sec
Zlib 1.7 sec
One big flower 4.0 sec
Flower with key frames 5.1 sec
Chain with key frames 24.5 sec
Not too surprising .
In the spirit of optimizing performance for the most common operations , why not keep all the more recent versions in a faster form ?
We could still use something more aggressive for the older stuff , but we can probably get a nice performance boost if we just refuse to use deltification for the most recent 10 versions of the file .
But how should we store those 10 versions ?
In full format ?
Or zlib ?
This is an arbitrary choice with a clear tradeoff .
For now , I choose zlib .
If we wanted a little more speed at the expense of using a little more space , we could just keep those 10 versions in full form .
By choosing zlib for the most recent 10 revisions , now my " get the recent stuff " benchmark runs in 1.7 seconds no matter what scheme I use .
But we still care about performance for the case where somebody fetches an older version , even if that fetch does n't happen as often .
That 's the point of version control storage .
Every version has to be available .
And when somebody does fetch version 495 , we want our version control system to still be reasonably fast .
Reversing the direction of the chains
Since the more recent versions are retrieved more often , obviously , our chains are all going the wrong direction .
If we had them go the other way , then retrieval would get slower as the versions get older instead of as the versions get newer .
But this approach does n't lend itself well to the way version control repositories naturally grow in the wild .
In these tests , I have mostly ignored the issues of constructing each storage scheme .
I 've already got all 508 versions , so I 'm just fiddling around with different schemes of storing them all , comparing size and retrieval time .
In practice , those 508 versions happened one at a time , in order .
If we 're going to store the versions with backward chains , then each time we commit a new version of the file , we 're going to need to re-encode something that was previously stored .
This makes the commit operation slower .
It is also a questionable idea from the perspective of data integrity .
The safest way to maintain data is to not touch it after it has been written .
Once it 's there , leave it alone .
One case where we might want to be a bit more liberal toward rewriting data is in a " pack " operation , such as the one Git has .
It would n't be terribly crazy to consider a standalone pack operation in a DVCS to be better than rewriting data for each commit , for several reasons :
It allows us to keep commit fast .
Since pack would be done offline , its implementation can be focused more on data integrity and space savings than on performance .
Since the pack code can be separated from the commit code , all the risky code can be kept together where it is easier to maintain .
Since the pack operation is separate from commit , a user that does not want to run pack does not have to .
A pack operation in a DVCS is happening on just one instance ( clone ) of the repository , not on the only copy .
Anyway , a pack operation would allow us to use storage schemes that do not work well on the fly , incrementally updating as each version comes in .
Visualizing the results
This plot makes it easier to see which schemes are better than others .
In my experimentation , I actually did a lot more schemes .
For example , instead of key frames every 10 versions , I also tried every 5 , 15 and 20 .
However , all those extra data points really cluttered the graph .
So I only included the most important ones here .
In the lower right , we find " full " .
Very fast and very large .
In the upper left , we find " chains " .
Very slow and very small .
We can ignore any point which is both above AND to the right of any other point .
The " 1 flower " point is the one where I made one big flower , using version 1 as the reference for every other version .
This scheme ends up being useless since zlib is better in both ways that matter .
All the other points represent possible tradeoffs which might be interesting , depending upon our priorities
Intuitively , the schemes which are closer to the origin are better .
This graph makes it easy to see that " zlib " and " flowers " are probably the two most interesting options I have discussed here .
Scientists at the University of Rochester have discovered that the hormone estrogen plays a pivotal role in how the brain processes sounds .
The findings , published in the May 5 issue of The Journal of Neuroscience , show for the first time that a sex hormone can directly affect auditory function , and point toward the possibility that estrogen controls other types of sensory processing as well .
Understanding how estrogen changes the brain 's response to sound , say the authors , might open the door to new ways of treating hearing deficiencies .
" We 've discovered estrogen doing something totally unexpected , " says Raphael Pinaud , assistant professor of brain and cognitive sciences at the University of Rochester and lead author of the study .
" We show that estrogen plays a central role in how the brain extracts and interprets auditory information .
It does this on a scale of milliseconds in neurons , as opposed to days , months or even years in which estrogen is more commonly known to affect an organism . "
Previous studies have hinted at a connection between estrogen and hearing in women who have low estrogen , such as often occurs after menopause , says Pinaud .
No one understood , however , that estrogen was playing such a direct role in determining auditory functions in the brain , he says .
" Now it is clear that estrogen is a key molecule carrying brain signals , and that the right balance of hormone levels in men and women is important for reasons beyond its role as a sex hormone , " says Pinaud .
Pinaud , along with Liisa Tremere , a research assistant professor of brain and cognitive sciences , and Jin Jeong , a postdoctoral fellow in Pinaud 's laboratory , demonstrated that increasing estrogen levels in brain regions that process auditory information caused heightened sensitivity of sound - processing neurons , which encoded more complex and subtle features of the sound stimulus .
Perhaps more surprising , says Pinaud , is that by blocking either the actions of estrogen directly , or preventing brain cells from producing estrogen within auditory centers , the signaling that is necessary for the brain to process sounds essentially shuts down .
Pinaud 's team also shows that estrogen is required to activate genes that instruct the brain to lay down memories of those sounds .
" It turns out that estrogen plays a dual role , " says Pinaud .
" It modulates the gain of auditory neurons instantaneously , and it initiates cellular processes that activate genes that are involved in learning and memory formation . "
Pinaud and his group stumbled upon these findings while investigating how estrogen may help change neuronal circuits to form memories of familiar songs in a type of bird typically used to understand the biology of vocal communication .
" Based on our findings we must now see estrogen as a central regulator of hearing , " he says .
" It both determines how carefully a sound must be processed , and activates intracellular processes that occur deep within the cell to form memories of sound experiences . "
Pinaud and his team will continue their work investigating how neurons adapt their functionality when encountering new sensory information and how these changes may ultimately enable the formation of memories .
They also will continue exploring the specific mechanisms by which estrogen might impact these processes .
" While we are currently conducting further experiments to confirm it , we believe that our findings extrapolate to other sensory systems and vertebrate species , " says Pinaud .
" If this is the case , we are on the way to showing that estrogen is a key molecule for processing information from all the senses . "
It 's hard not to see the continued sell - off on Wall Street and the growing fear on Main Street as a product , at least in part , of the realization that our new president 's policies are designed to radically re-engineer the market - based U.S. economy , not just mitigate the recession and financial crisis .
The illusion that Barack Obama will lead from the economic center has quickly come to an end .
Instead of combining the best policies of past Democratic presidents -- John Kennedy on taxes , Bill Clinton on welfare reform and a ...
Can Mr. Fusion become a reality ?

Cheap energy unleashes a population bubble
Look on the bright side
What 's lacking : Ethics
Humans are not yet ready for free energy
( Natural News )
As the editor of NaturalNews , I 've long been a proponent of free energy technologies and research .
I 've written about the reality of cold fusion for more than ten years , braving the incessant whining of ignorant scientists who said it was all a hoax , year after year , right up until the U.S.
Navy recently announced its own cold fusion breakthroughs .
But in the world of free energy , cold fusion is where things are just warming up .
The really interesting stuff is more in the realm of -- tapping the vast stores of pure energy woven into the fabric of reality , even absent any physical matter whatsoever .
There is absolutely no doubt in my mind that free energy research has been blocked , discredited and suppressed by an organized cabal of fossil fuel pushers , but that 's a different story altogether .
This story is about something more pressing :
There are many good candidates for free energy technologies that could be commercialized and sold for a few thousand dollars per household .
Theoretically , such a device would be installed in a home ( or office ) and simply channel electricity day after day , year after year , with no moving parts and without ever using up its energy source .
Note , carefully , that this does not by definition violate any laws of physics .
These devices are n't creating energy from nothing ; they 're simply channel energy from one form to another , much like solar panels do .
The pop-culture rendition of this concept is the " Mr. Fusion " machine in themovie series :
Feed it banana peels and you get enormous amounts of energy along the lines of Einstein 's famous equation : E = MCThat 's a lot of juice from banana peels .
Let 's leapfrog past the question of whether a Mr. Fusion type of device can actually be commercialized and go right to the larger issues here :
What happens if Mr. Fusion machines could be purchased for a few thousand bucks ?
I say that unless something radical changes in the ethics and behavior of humankind , such an invention would result inand the eventual collapse of human civilization .
Why ?
Read on , dear friends ... Think about how we got where we are right now :
We live on an over - populated planet that 's been over - developed , mined , exploited , polluted and devastated by the sudden presence of a ballooning human population .
In the year 1750 , the world population was around 800 million .
By 2050 , it 's estimated to reach nearly -- a growth rate of over 1000 % in just three centuries ( the blink of an eye in terms of planetary history ) .
( http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_populatio...
How was this population growth made possible ?
Yep : Cheap energy is what made the industrial revolution possible -- and with it came cheap food and an ensuing population bubble .
The discovery and harnessing of fossil fuels resulted in the most astonishing population boom our planet has ever seen .
Along with it , of course , came the organized destruction of nature .
All those people have to live somewhere , after all .
Their food has to be grown somewhere ; their home construction materials have to be harvested from somewhere ; and they have to poop somewhere , too .
As the population bubble was fueled by cheap energy ( fossil fuels ) , so did the destruction of nature and the paving over of our natural world .
Cheap energy gave us mechanized agriculture , low - cost ocean fishing and affordable ways to level mountains , dig canals and engage in serious terraforming activities ( like the construction of the Hoover Dam or the Panama Canal ) .
And yet there is a limit to all this .
It 's a limit imposed by the practical costs of drilling and refining fossil fuels .
There 's also a limit to how much fossil fuel is contained in the Earth ( peak oil is upon us ) .
As a result of these real - world limits , there are mountains that cannot be profitably turned into condos .
There is beach front property that cannot be profitably transformed into vacation resorts .
Mother Nature benefits from a margin of safety simply because further destruction is beyond the economic reach of developers ..
With essentially free energy powering a new generation of electric cars , trucks , planes and earth - moving equipment ( with their Mr. Fusion devices on board ) , there is no longer any natural barrier to property development .
Electric - powered personal aircraft would become practical and affordable , allowing the commercialization of previously remote sites .
Even the paving of new roads and railways becomes remarkably cheap when energy costs nothing .
Free energy could unleash the most drastic population explosion and development boom ever seen on our planet .
And the result , I fear , would be the near - complete destruction of our natural world .
This is the pessimistic side of the free energy story .
But there 's another side ...
On the bright side of this equation , free energy would allow the global reclamation of deserts , turning them into oasis farmlands with lush natural life .
How is this possible ?
ThroughIf energy is essentially free , processing ocean water into fresh water and pumping it into deserts for agriculture , reforestation or property development is dirt cheap .
Suddenly , you could see the world 's deserts being reforested with the help of free energy technology .
At the same time , all this new farmland would actually contribute to the population problem by creating new sources of cheap food .
The food bubble , in other words , would grow even larger , and the population densities of the cities would increase substantially .
Then again , if energy is really free , we could , essentially ending the carbon emissions that now threaten the planet with global warming .
This would directly reduce the carbon footprint associated with energy use , indirectly increasing the carrying capacity of the planet .
Stated another way , if energy is clean and ( nearly ) free , then the planet can probably handle a larger population .
Free energy could also replace all the nuclear power plants in the world , eliminating both nuclear waste and the potential for nuclear reactor disasters .
It could even replace the electricity generated from hydroelectric dams , which were once thought to produce " clean " energy but in reality have proven to be ecological disasters .
So there is a potential bright side to free energy .
But how do we know whether such technologies will be used to create rather than destroy ?
The human race has not yet achieved the level of consciousness and ethics that would seem to be prerequisites for the handling of such powerful technologies .
Free energy is no toy -- it is a planet - changing technology that could be used for either tremendous good or endless evil .
It all depends on the intentions and self - imposed limitations of those who use the technology .
This point has not been missed by free energy inventors .
One inventor in a remote village says his device already powers the entire village , but he refuses to release it to the world for precisely the reasons I 've mentioned here :
The world is n't ready for such advanced technologies .
Humans did n't do too well handling fossil fuels , after all .
Handing them even bigger toys to play with might be disastrous ... Another potential concern is that free energy might not really be free .
Perhaps a zero point energy deviceto produce energy from nothing , but maybe a million light years away some star is winking out of existence because the zero point device is somehow sapping its energy and tunneling it across the universe to power your personal helicopter .
Even if humans can invent free energy devices , it 's no guarantee we understand the ramifications of using them .
This is the story of fossil fuels , after all : Cheap energy colliding with poor planning .
Oil seemed endless for a while , and the environment seemed fine for a while , too .
But now that we 've come to realize how the burning of fossil fuels is destroying our future , it 's too late to undo the damage .
Furthermore , the availability of cheap energy in the form of fossil fuels has taught the citizens of advanced nations to be extremely wasteful .
Even cheaper " free " energy would terminate any efforts to teach energy conservation , resulting in a world of wasteful energy consumers who think nothing of leaving the electric car running all night just so the heater works in the morning without any warm - up delay ( as an example ) .
Making energy free means there is essentially no cost to wasting it .
So why not build homes without insulation and use free energy to run all the air conditioners ?
Why not populate the oceans with cruise ships powered by large - scale free - energy devices ?
There 's no limit to the waste when energy is essentially free .
I agree that free energy sounds like a panacea , especially at first glance .
Replace the coal - fired power plants and ditch gasoline vehicles for quiet , clean electric vehicles !
Sounds great , right ?
But once you look more closely at the root cause of the current human population bubble -- and the destruction of nature we 've caused in the last century -- it becomes obvious that The fact that energy actually costs something right now is , in effect , putting the brakes on many of the activities of human beings .
So it acts like a natural limiter of development and population .
Lifting that cost and making energy " free " would unleash a whole new era of population growth and destructive exploitation of nature .
I believe human beings may be ready for free energy someday , and without question certain individuals or communities may have the wisdom to use these technologies wisely right now , but in no way is the human population as a whole ready to be handed this technology .
For the most part , humans are a race of narrow - minded , short - sighted infants who have proven themselves incapable of long - term planning or even respecting life on the planet .
Before humans are given free energy , they need to demonstrate the responsible use of existing resources and technologies , and sadly , humans are far from that ..
Nuclear physics ?
It was all about war .
Space exploration ?
It was about war , too .
Exploring the oceans ?
War. Microbiology advances ?
War. Robotics ?
War. Solar technology ?
The U.S. military is the largest customer of solar tech .
Even the Internet was originally developed as an information grid designed to send military messages during a nuclear attack .
Human beings have proven themselves to be preoccupied with war , profit and self destruction .
Given such traits , the very last thing humans need right now is breakthrough energy technology that produces endless energy at virtually zero cost .
Handing this over to human beings now would be like giving a child a set of big red buttons for launching nuclear missiles .
What could be a possible solution for all this ?.
If a device could amplify positive human intention into cheap energy -- while not working at all for those with dark hearts -- it could change everything for the positive .
Love , after all , is the highest vibratory energy in the universe .
It 's not beyond imagination that love might someday be tapped as a conduit for clean , renewable electromagnetic energy .

No animated pic has ever opened Cannes Film Festival before but at the opening ceremony of the 62nd edition of the fest on May 13 , 2009 animated 3D comedy “ Up ” directed bywill have its world premiere .
At the press screening this morning in Cannes , fest chiefstood on stage with a small digital camera to welcome critics and journalists and snap a photo of everyone wearing their 3 - D glasses .
“ The thing I ’m looking forward to the most is seeing that great image of all these people tonight in their tuxedos , bow ties and gowns , wearing 3 - D glasses in that big theater .
That ’s going to be a good picture , ” Chief Creative Officerjoked at a news conference .
“ We ’ve always made our films in 3 - D , but we ’ve just shown them in 2 - D , ” Lasseter proclaimed during a post - screening press conference today in Cannes . “ All our films will be made in 3 - D in the future , ” Lasseter added .
The 10th feature by Disney ’s Pixar studios was warmly clapped at its press screening and it should get a similar welcome at the formal ceremony that opens the festival in the evening .
The red carpet was unfurled and the 3 - D glasses were at hand as the 62nd Cannes Film Festival opened Wednesday .
A host of celebrities have jetted in to the French Riviera for the gala opening of this year ’s Cannes Film Festival .
Stars includingandare expected to attend while promoting their latest films .
Soon members of the jury , led by French actresswould be wrangling over which auteurs should receive Cannes ’ coveted prizes – fromtoand New Zealand ’s
“ I do n’t think we are here to judge , ” Huppert said .
“ I think we are here to love films , and to see what we love more than others . ”
There are lots of cross-cultural films on offer – Ken Loach with “ , ” a Spanish thriller set in Japan , a Taiwanese filmmaker ’s travails in France and Johnny Hallyday as a French chef on the trail of vengeance in Hong Kong .
But while Asia and Europe have a strong showing , there ’s a noticeable absence of films from Latin America .
The festival runs until 24 May when the Palme d’Or prize will be announced .

Nun im Vorfeld von Europawahl und Bundestagswahl wird nicht nur bei der Internetzensur kräftig Populismus angerührt sondern auch beim neu angefachten Verbot von Spielen von Counterstrike bis Paintball .
In beiden Fällen wird der gesunde Menschenverstand kräftig mit Füssen getreten und es wird eine sachferne Debatte geführt .
Die große Koalition flüchtet sich hier offenbar gerne in Stammtischpolitik , da sie ansonsten eine erschreckende Bilanz der Untätigkeit und Stümperei mit sich führt .
Zu dieser Art Ablenkungsmanöver von CDU und SPD gibt es nur eine richtige Antwort :
auch nicht bei der Europawahl !
Zu der ‚ Killerspiel ‘ - Debatte sind eigentlich alle Argumente ausgetauscht , leider werden Fakten oft genug ausgeblendet , insbesondere die große Zahl von erwachsenen , friedliebenden Menschen , die sich auf LAN - Parties oder beim Paintball mit ihren Freunden treffen zur gemeinsamen Freizeitbeschäftigung .
Allen Eltern sei gesagt : das soziale Miteinander macht solche Aktivitäten zu einer empfehlenswerte Sache , lassen Sie ihr Kind nicht alleine zu Hause vor dem Fernseher sitzen und achten Sie darauf , dass es nicht ewig alleine zu Hause vor dem Computer sitzt .
( Auf LAN - Parties spielt man übrigens nicht World - of - Warcraft . )
Den erwachsenen Spielern möchte ich als jemand der selbst gerne Counterstrike spielt ans Herz legen , bei den nächsten Wahlen ein Zeichen gegen soviel Volksverdummung zu setzen , natürlich mit einem Kreuzchen bei der Piratenpartei .
The changes , if enacted , would take effect in 2011 , when administration officials presume the economy will have recovered from the recession .
But business groups were quick to condemn the White House for proposing tax increases amid a global downturn .
“ This plan will reduce the ability of U.S. companies to compete in foreign markets , which will not only reduce jobs , but will also cripple economic growth here in the United States .
It could n’t come at a worse time , ” said John J. Castellani , president of the Business Roundtable , a trade association of major businesses .
The proposals would especially hit pharmaceutical , technology , financial and consumer goods companies — among them Goldman Sachs , Microsoft , Pfizer and Procter & Gamble — that have major overseas operations or subsidiaries in tax havens like the Cayman Islands .
They have some of the mightiest lobbying armies in Washington , as well as influential patrons in Congress .
That combination will test Mr. Obama ’s ability to stand up to powerful interests and marshal support among lawmakers at the same time that he is trying to win passage of major health and energy measures .
At issue are tax laws that were originally intended to prevent multinational corporations from being double - taxed , by the United States and by foreign countries , by allowing companies to defer reporting their foreign income to the Internal Revenue Service and to get tax credits in the United States for foreign taxes paid .
A controversial scientific revolution that could give packaged foods a dramatically longer shelf life and boost crop growth has " real potential " to help feed a fast - growing world , according to environment secretary Hilary Benn .
New developments in nanotechnology , engineering carried out at a microscopic level , could lead to plastic packaging designed to stop food and drink spoiling by killing bacteria or preventing oxygen getting through the container .
The technology could also be used to enrich food with supplements and preserve vitamins that would otherwise be destroyed as food aged .
Farmers could also use it to ensure the slow release of fertilisers at the right time for crops , and to detect threats from pests or pollutants .
The technology is , however , highly controversial , with green campaigners arguing that its effects on human health are unknown .
Benn is spearheading a government project on how to cope with an estimated doubling in demand for food production worldwide by 2050 , driven by a growing population and changing dietary habits in emerging nations .
" Nanotechnology has clear potential , " he told the Observer .
" As with all of these technologies , the government 's job is to make sure we fully understand the consequences of using it , but clearly it has got real potential .
We ought to be looking at all the means at our disposal . "
Nanotechnology is increasingly being seen as a successor to genetically modified ( GM ) techniques in food production , with GM trials meeting consumer resistance and sabotage by activists .
The science is still in its infancy , but materials currently in development include fizzy - drink bottles made with nanoparticles embedded in the lining to stop carbon dioxide leaking out of the bottle , and storage bins with microscopic particles of silver , which has antibacterial properties , designed to kill any bacteria growing in the contents .
Other potential applications include nanoparticles designed to absorb the vitamins in produce such as orange juice , where the vitamin C levels deteriorate quickly after the fruit has been juiced , and release them only when the liquid is drunk .
In the US , trials have also looked at the feasibility of developing " nanosensors " to be embedded in farm animals , which might be able to detect disease before it infected the whole herd .
Benn said a royal commission on environmental pollution recently had concluded there was " no evidence " of harm to health from nanotechnology , although the government was continuing to fund research to answer questions about its environmental or health impact .
" Subject to people being assured of those things , then they will weigh up the benefits of the technology and take their decisions about whether to use it . "
Campaigners say the potential impacts of nanotechnology on both human health and the environment are unproven .
Nanotechnology foods would require licensing in the UK , but Benn said the government was pushing for a wider regulatory regime to be established across the EU .
The changing economic climate has led to a renewed interest among governments in GM .
Benn pointed to the use of GM soya , which is cheaper than conventional soya , in animal feed , adding : " Individuals will make their own choices , and I understand completely why people would be looking very hard at trying to stretch their pounds . "
He said that the UK would await the outcome of scientific trials before any GM product could be approved for commercial growing , adding that producers would have to demonstrate that GM crops lived up to the claims made for them before they could contribute to any strategy to boost food production .
" If GM crops could help deliver better nutrition by enriching vitamins , and if GM was able to develop more drought - resistant or pest - resistant crops , then we have got a basis on which to have a discussion , " he added .
Nano science : A backgrounder
Scientists have greeted the plans to give nanotechnology a greater role in food production with guarded optimism .
Yes , the move was encouraging but it was also long overdue , they said .
Nanotechnology is engineering carried out at a microscopic level .
Typical nanoparticles are around 30 nanometres , or 30 billionths of a metre , in diameter - roughly a 100,000th of the width of a human hair - and can be engineered to carry specks of chemicals or coat a surface or release signals .
The potential of these materials is immense , as both the Royal Society and the Royal Society of Engineering pointed out in 2003 .
Since then several UK universities have developed world - ranking status as nanotechnology centres , including Imperial College London and Oxford .
However , support from the government has been weak and only now have there been signs of interest .
" There are many ways in which nanoparticles could be used to boost food production , " said Professor Terry Wilkins , of Leeds University 's Nanomanufacturing Institute .
" They could be used to encapsulate flavouring into foods ; create packages that will change colour if their food contents go off or be used as coatings that will be bacteria - proof .
However , we cannot expect the public to accept this technology without evidence that it has been rigorously tested to show it is completely safe .
That must be the first task of any initiative in this field . "

Dr. George Tiller was one of the highest - profile abortion providers in America .
In socially conservative Wichita , Kansas , Tiller provided not only early - term abortions , but also the rarely - utilized late - term abortions .
There 's a tremendous body of case law that 's built up over the abortion protests in Kansas .
In the 1980's and early 1990's , the Buffalo , NY area was probably the epicenter of the battle between abortion providers and the militant anti-abortion movement .
Since then , Kansas — a state that 's also home to anti-gay lunatic Fred Phelps and a state board of education that pushed the teaching of creationism over evolution — has become a new burned - over district of radical right culture war fervor .
Even if he only provided more common family planning and abortion services , Tiller would have been subject to tremendous pressure in Wichita , Kansas .
But as a provider of late - term abortions , he was a major target of domestic terrorists .
In 1985 his clinic was bombed .
In 1993 , he was shot in both arms by Shelly Shannon , whose arrest eventually exposed a far right domestic terrorist network called the Army of God.
Earlier this month Tiller reported damage to his clinic , including sliced wires to surveillance cameras .
Today the rightwing domestic terrorists finally succeeded in assassinating Tiller :
The shooting occurred at around 10 a.m. ( Central time ) at Reformation Lutheran Church on the city ’s East Side , Dr. Tiller ’s regular church .
Wichita police said that the shots were fired from a handgun in the church lobby during the morning service .
The authorities gave few details , but said they were searching for a powder blue Taurus made in the 1990s that had been seen leaving shortly after the shooting .
They said witnesses had described seeing a white man departing .
Surely whichever terrorist committed this assassination , and whichever fellow - terrorists may have been involved in planning and perpetrating the act , will claim that their murder in a church was done to enact God 's will .
Violent and conspiratorial talk is not something limited to fringe low - wattage radio stations and secret publications ; one only need tune in to Fox News ' Glenn Beck to hear the rhetoric and conspiracy theories that inspired Timothy McVeigh .
But the one - world crew is n't focused only on fears of the UN , black helicopters and cabals of Jewish financiers .
Kossack Frederick Clarkson , who helps run the excellent blog Talk to Action , is one of the nation 's most diligent and expert followers of the far right , especially where the religion merges with the violent radical right .
Clarkson has written extensively on anti-abortion violence , showing in particular how anti-abortion extremists have linked with rightwing domestic terrorists :
More and more , anti-abortion extremists , white supremacist groups and the conspiracy - minded " Patriot " movement have come to share the same enemies list .
Many in these previously separate movements agree that everything smacking of " one-worldism " — the Olympics , the United Nations and any other global agency — is part of a massive plot to subject Americans to tyranny .
Activists in all three movements describe homosexuals as " sodomites , " people who deserve capital punishment .
And in the latest development , many of those involved in these groups are bitterly attacking abortion .
" Eric Rudolph is symbolic of this new merger , " says Dallas Blanchard , chairman of the University of West Florida 's sociology department in Pensacola .
" Militia types have shown more and more interest in the abortion issue , while anti-abortionists are becoming more and more militant and allying themselves with the militia movement . "
Since the early 1990s , Patriot and white supremacist groups have used mainstream issues like gun control and land and environmental regulation to draw people into their organizations .
Now , they are taking up the banner of fighting abortion .
In 2007 , Meteor Blades wondered whether a Democratic win in 2008 would generate rightwing violence :
The hatred that led Tim McVeigh or Eric Rudolph to commit their murderous acts is still with us , indeed , deeply embedded , and spouted by the likes of Ann Coulter , Hal Turner and others of their ilk from their high - wattage podiums .
We ignore this hatred and its fascistic purveyors at our peril .
Most Americans believe the country has begun moving in the right direction .
But there has always been an element in American society that hates progress toward tolerance and inclusion , and see in social change a grave threat , and vast conspiracy , a threat to their liberty .
Vigilantism of the kind that we saw today demonstrates that not all Americans are ready for change and disagreement within civil society , and will oppose tolerance , progress and the legitimacy of the government with whatever violent means they can employ .
Japanese opposition member criticizes 11.7 - billion - yen construction cost
Yukio Hatoyama of the opposition Democratic Party of Japan ( DPJ ) has criticized the proposed 2009 budget earmarks for the construction of an anime museum .
Hatoyama asserted on Saturday night that Prime Minister Tarō Asō is proposing the museum because " Asō likes anime " and therefore is trying to create his own bureaucracy for his interests .
Hatoyama added , " Simply put , it 's a national manga kissaten ( café ) .
Such an enormous waste is very foolish . "
The government is planning the museum as a place to exhibit anime , manga , films , and other forms of culture .
The plan aims to attract 600,000 visitors to the proposed construction site at Tokyo's artificial island of Odaiba .
11.7 billion yen ( US $ 118 million ) is being allocated from the current year 's budget for the construction costs .
The museum is part of Asō 's larger proposal to use his country 's " soft power " in anime , manga , and similar areas of culture to create jobs and reverse the economic downturn .
Asō has used anime as an example of cultural exchange since he was foreign minister , before he was elevated to his country 's top post last September .
Asō told the audience at October 's 21st Tokyo International Film Festival , only half - jokingly , that he is apparently more well known in Japan for being a manga geek than prime minister .
Studio Ghibli co-founder and director Hayao Miyazaki has criticized Asō 's public emphasis on his manga reading and downplayed the use of Japanese entertainment to promote the country and to raise its youth .
Source : Sankei Shimbun
Update : Ichiro Ozawa is reportedly planning to step down as the head of DPJ on Monday .
As DPJ 's Secretary General , Hatoyama is one of the top contenders as Ozawa 's replacement .
The DPJ is hoping to gain seats in the next parliamentary elections , since Asō and his ruling Liberal Democratic Party ( the relatively conservative party of Japan ) is facing low poll numbers .
Star Wars is a story of aliens and space battles , but it's also a story of ghosts and mystical powers .
Is Star Wars science fiction , or is it fantasy ?
More importantly , what makes it one or the other ?
Magic Versus Science
The difference between sci-fi and fantasy is a much - debated subject .
One common dividing line , however , is that science fiction is about scientific and technological advancements that could reasonably occur in the future , while fantasy exists only in the realm of imagination .
Much of Star Wars does deal with advanced technology , which seems to put it in the realm of science fiction .
We may not have hyperdrives that allow for interstellar travel , but we can easily see manned spaceships that travel to other planets as a natural progression from traveling to the moon and sending unmanned probes to other planets in our solar system .
Some of the technology in Star Wars is not even that far off ; for example , scientists have already been able to create miniature lightsaber - like devices .
The existence of the Force , however , makes Star Wars seem more like fantasy than science fiction .
The Force is a mystical energy field which gives Jedi seemingly magical powers , and the study of the Force is more like a religion than a science .
The idea of midi-chlorians , microorganisms in the blood , attempts to provide a scientific explanation for the Force ; but even midi-chlorians cannot explain how the Force can make bodies disappear or allow beings to become ghosts after death .
Hard Sci-Fi Versus Space Opera
Sci-fi and fantasy have many sub-genres , each with their own common elements .
One subgenre is " hard sci - fi , " or sci - fi concerned with scientific accuracy .
The author of a hard sci - fi work might , for example , do extensive research to make sure the spaceship she created works under known scientific principles .
The author of a " soft sci - fi " work , on the other hand , might be comfortable just saying that the spaceship works ; exactly how is not important to the story .
Star Wars falls into the sub - genre of " space opera , " which takes many of its elements from adventure fiction .
Space opera involves plots , battles , characters , and abilities on a huge , dramatic scale , all of which is true of Star Wars .
Technology and other scientific elements in Star Wars are often scientifically inaccurate or merely given a scientific flavor ; for example , the midi-chlorian explanation for Force - sensitivity .
In much of hard sci - fi , the science is the story ; in Star Wars and other space opera , the science is a backdrop for the real story .
This does n't make Star Wars any less science fiction .
Science Fantasy
While it may feel like a cop-out , the best answer to whether Star Wars is sci- fi or fantasy is that it 's a little bit of both .
Calling Star Wars " sci-fi " ignores its fantasy elements , such as the Force ; but calling Star Wars " fantasy " ignores its interplanetary setting and sci - fi feel .
The best label for Star Wars may be " science fantasy , " a subgenre that blends elements of sci-fi and the supernatural .
There 's no need to force Star Wars into a sci- fi or fantasy genre box when its science fiction and fantasy components work together in harmony .

The jailers of the 19th century — even in the pre-Civil War South — largely abandoned the practice of imprisoning people for falling into debt as counterproductive and ultimately barbaric .
In the 1970s and ’ 80s , the U.S. Supreme Court affirmed that incarcerating people who ca n’t pay fines because of poverty violates the U.S. Constitution .
Welcome to the debtors ’ prisons of the 21st century .
Apparently , though , some states and county jails never got the memo .
Welcome to the debtors ’ prisons of the 21st century .
“ Edwina Nowlin , a poor Michigan resident , was ordered to reimburse a juvenile detention center $ 104 a month for holding her 16 - year - old son , ” the New York Times wrote in an editorial .
“ When she explained to the court that she could not afford to pay , Ms. Nowlin was sent to prison .
The American Civil Liberties Union of Michigan , which helped get her out last week after she spent 28 days behind bars , says it is seeing more people being sent to jail because they cannot make various court - ordered payments .
That is both barbaric and unconstitutional . ”
The details of Nowlin ’s case are even more alarming than the Times editorial suggests .
Not only was Nowlin under orders to pay a fine stemming from someone else ’s actions , but she had been laid off from work and lost her home at the time she was ordered to “ reimburse ” the county for her son ’s detention .
Despite her inability to pay , she was held in contempt of court and ordered to serve a 30 - day sentence .
On March 6 , three days after she was incarcerated , she was released for one day to work .
She also picked up her paycheck , in the amount of $ 178.53 .
This , she thought , could be used to pay the $ 104 , and she would be released from jail .
But when she got back to the jail , the sheriff told her to sign her check over to the county — to pay $ 120 for her own room and board , and $ 22 for a drug test and booking fee .
Even more absurd , Nowlin requested but was denied a court - appointed lawyer .
So because she was too poor to afford a lawyer and denied her constitutional right to have the court provide one for her , she could n’t fight the contempt charge that stemmed from her poverty .
And her contempt conviction only added to her poverty , as the fines and fees she was obligated to pay now multiplied .
“ Like many people in these desperate economic times , Ms. Nowlin was laid off from work , lost her home and is destitute , ” said Michael Steinberg , legal director of the Michigan ACLU .
“ Jailing her because of her poverty is not only unconstitutional , it ’s unconscionable and a shameful waste of resources .
It is not a crime to be poor in this country , and the government must stop resurrecting debtor ’s prisons from the dustbin of history . ”
Michigan is n’t the only place where you can be imprisoned for the crime of involuntary poverty .
The same Catch - 22 ensnares poor defendants daily in courtrooms across the country .
In 2006 , the Southern Center for Human Rights ( SCHR ) filed a suit on behalf of Ora Lee Hurley , who could n’t get out of prison until she had enough money to pay a $ 705 fine .
But she could n’t pay the fine because she had to pay the Georgia Department of Corrections $ 600 a month for room and board , and spend $ 76 a month on public transportation , laundry and food .
[ efoods ]
She was released five days a week to work at the K&K Soul Food restaurant , where she earned $ 6.50 an hour , which netted her about $ 700 a month after taxes .
Hurley was trapped in prison for eight months beyond her initial 120 - day sentence until the Southern Center intervened .
Over the course of her incarceration , she earned about $ 7,000 , but she never had enough at one time to pay off her $ 705 fine .
“ This is a situation where if this woman was able to write a check for the amount of the fine , she would be out of there , ” Sarah Geraghty , a SCHR lawyer , told the Atlanta Journal Constitution while Hurley was still imprisoned .
“ And because she can ’t , she ’s still in custody .
It ’s as simple as that . ”
Georgia also lets for - profit probation companies prey on people too poor to pay their traffic violations and court fees .
According to a 2008 SCHR report entitled “ Profiting from the poor ” :
In courts around Georgia , people who are charged with misdemeanors and cannot pay their fines that day in court are placed on probation under the supervision of private , for - profit companies until they pay off their fines .
On probation , they must pay these companies substantial monthly “ supervision fees ” that may double or triple the amount that a person of means would pay for the same offense .
For example , a person of means may pay $ 200 for a traffic ticket on the day of court and be done with it , while a person too poor to pay that day is placed on probation and ends up paying $ 500 or more for the same offense .
The privatization of misdemeanor probation has placed unprecedented law enforcement authority in the hands of for - profit companies that act essentially as collection agencies .
These companies , focused on profit rather than public safety or rehabilitation , are not designed to supervise people or connect them to services and jobs .
Rather , they charge exorbitant monthly fees and use the threat of imprisonment and a variety of bullying tactics to squeeze money out of the men and women under their supervision .
For too many poor people convicted of misdemeanors , our state is not living up to the constitutional promise of equal justice under law .
In Gulfport , Miss. , the municipal court started a “ fine collection task force ” to crack down on people who owed fees for misdemeanors .
According to the SCHR Web site :
The task force trolled through predominantly African American neighborhoods , rounding up people who had outstanding court fines .
After arresting and jailing them , the City of Gulfport processed these people through a court proceeding at which no defense attorney was present or even offered .
Many people were jailed for months after hearings lasting just seconds .
While the city collected money , it also packed the jail with hundreds of people who could n’t pay , including people who were sick , physically disabled and / or limited by mental disabilities .
The disregard of the justice system for the rights of poor people to equal protection and due process is cause for outrage .
But it should n’t come as a surprise in an era when the government spends billions bailing out banks while letting foreclosures and unemployment ruin the lives of working people .
We need to build a movement , like the working - class struggles of the 1930s , that can demand an end to the inhuman practice of incarcerating people for no other crime than finding themselves at the bottom of the social ladder .

Europe 's Largest Wind Farm Gets Approval in Sweden
April 7th , 2009 by Dave Tyler
In this current gold rush climate for green energy words such as “ biggest ” and “ largest ” get thrown around all the time in an effort to grab some headlines .
But this project in Sweden is big no matter how you parse it .
[ social_buttons ]
With 1,101 turbines it would be Europe ’s biggest wind farm , and as organizers told the Norrbotten county board in the region where the project would be built , possibly the biggest in the world .
It would cost 55 billion kronor or roughly $ 6.9 billion .
It would be located in the northern part of Sweden , near Markbygden and occupy 175 square miles .
The Swedish government still needs to sign off , and that process could take another 12 months .
Construction could begin in 2.5 years and take about 10 years to complete , the company behind the project , Markbygden Vind AB , said .
AFP reports that if built the farm would generate a total of eight to 12 terawatt hours of electricity per year .
Who actually wears the title of “ world ’s biggest wind farm ” is n’t really the point .
You can tap any number of projects with some sort of title .
Projects of this scale are only getting built because developers have figured out there ’s money to be made .
As long as that ’s still the case , it wo n’t be long before another “ world ’s biggest ” moves into construction .
There may be some vanity involved , but in the long run its going to lead to cleaner generation .

The UAE is home to Dubai , the region 's commercial hub
The United Arab Emirates is withdrawing from plans for Gulf monetary union , dealing a blow to further economic integration in the oil - rich region .
The state said it would be keeping its own currency , the dirham , which would remain pegged to the dollar .
No explanation was given , but the UAE has expressed reservations about the choice of the Saudi capital , Riyadh , as home for the union 's central bank .
The state is the second of six Gulf states to pull out of the union plan .
Oman had already said it would not be taking part .
The other four states - Saudi Arabia , Kuwait , Qatar and Bahrain - are committed to the plan , said Mustapha al - Shamali , Kuwait 's finance minister .
Vook.tv : Right Suspicion , Wrong Idea
So this guy Bradley Inman -- a thriller novelist and California entrepreneur -- is trying to create a company that adds value to novels by giving them high electronic production values , lots of original digital video , and a social media component .
He has hired Sara Nelson ( the former editor of " Publisher 's Weekly " ) to be a consultant on his new project .
Inman feels that the problem with selling books today is that books do n't have enough movies in them .
He is also asking the other hard questions facing publishing : why do n't the characters in novels have their own Twitter streams ?
Why can't you tell authors of books exactly what is wrong with their prose in publisher - hosted forums that will help authors " fix " their ideas before the next version comes out ?
Inman intends to address these concerns by acquiring a massive amount of start - up capital and then selling his company off to some struggling publishing house that believes in his business model .
In the meantime , he is calling his creations " vooks . "
You know , half book , half video .
A vook .
From the New York Times " Vook tries to address a big problem for book publishers as they expand onto digital formats .
For all the hype and initial success of devices like the Kindle , they threaten to strip traditional books of much of their transportive appeal .
Images on the jacket cover , inviting fonts and the satisfying feel of quality paper are all largely absent , replaced by humdrum pixels on a virtual page .
" Even worse , on multipurpose reading devices like the iPhone , more immediately gratifying pastimes like video games are a click away for readers with short attention spans .
"
In addition to writing thriller novels , Inman has also created and sold start - up real estate companies , and he currently runs " TurnHere , " a company which creates internet advertisements and web video .
Do n't get me wrong : Inman has the right idea about the market .
He understands the hunger and hate that surges in publishing houses as they watch their relevance and power shrink , their usefulness dissipating like semen into the ocean as storytellers are courted by film and other electronic media instead of turning to good old fiction to get their junk out .
I agree with his assessment that electronic books need to be more than just text on a screen in order to take full advantage of the possibilities of the fully - integrated multimedia format .
But Inman owns a movie - making company , and when all you have is a knife , everything looks like a throat .
Combining movies and books is not something that anybody wants .
It is essentially the same concept that killed several video game developers ( and at least one console , the Sega Saturn ) .
Developers tried to force video onto their skeptical customers because the urge to fill up their games with full - motion video instead of taking the time to code fun gameplay or write interesting plots was simply too powerful to resist .
Game developers thought that by including video in their games they would make the experiences more immersive and more interactive .
They thought people wanted to be constantly reminded that they were the heroes of these stories and that the action was taking place in the real world to real people .
But there was always an insurmountable disjunction .
The gameplay was nothing like real life .
Both elements suffered : the video always seemed like the tedious build - up to a sex scene in porn , and the gameplay always seemed like random bullshit that you had to do in order to journey to the next bit of " fun video .
"
Not only dated and hard to watch , these FMVs for video games were fundamentally hostile to the very idea of video games : they reminded you of reality at all turns , and constantly shoved it in your face that you were wasting your time playing a stupid game .
The actors were unskilled and bored .
People assumed the same weaknesses in the game developer .
When people throw down their money for a game ( or book ) , they want to explore what is different about this medium , not how the medium can converge toward America 's most successful industry , film .
If they buy a book or video game , it means they are sick of watching movies .
It means that ( for a while anyway ) consumers want to participate in the unique power of a competing art form .
In the case of a video game , they want to control their experience and feel directly connected to every plot point and transition .
In the case of a book , they want to put their imagination through aerobic combat and delve as deep as possible into the emotional or philosophical ramifications of a brand new idea or situation .
They want to dream .
They want to cast off their flesh and dance around in their bones for awhile .
Giving a person a drug when they crave a dream is what a bad babysitter does .
They put on a movie instead of reading a story ( and doing all the voices ) .
This is not to suggest that images and text are always in direct conflict , although I have fought to uphold this position before .
However , in the case of an illustrated novel , the images must not do anything that the novel does better .
They must create atmosphere and possibility instead of narrowing the illusions of the reader , forcefeeding her the difficult structures that the author has worked so hard to make delicious .
That being said , there is a tremendous amount of work to do as far as making electronic books into something new , something bold , and something valuable -- a medium that takes full advantage of all the available technology .
Creators and innovators in publishing should fear no experiment and should explore every possibility .
However , there is nothing WRONG with stories as they are .
Adding video vignettes and reenactments , adding Twitter , adding social networking : these are all gestures that make the reader question the writer 's skill .
They are wrong turns .
They do not add to the power of the art .
A ninja with a machine gun is not as intimidating as a ninja with a paring knife .
Publishers must find new ways to deploy their ninjas and stop looking for new ways to arm them .
The ninjas are fine at killing .
They are experts , in fact .
They simply need the respect of clients who can pay .
If Cheers is the bar where everyone knows your name , then Club Bounce is the one where everyone knows your weight .
Well , maybe not to the pound , but Bounce is the Long Beach nightclub that caters specially to plus- sized people , the Whittier Daily News reported .
" Club Bounce is a size - acceptance nightclub , " said club owner Lisa Marie Garbo , 40 .
" People of larger shapes and sizes can go and feel comfortable , accepted and desired and not feel like they 're second - class citizens for being overweight . "
Bounce , on the Pacific Coast Highway , is only a weekend deal , but it 's a success : Garbo has opened another location in Phoenix , AZ , and plans to open one in Hollywood .
Garbo , who says she 's a distant cousin of the Hollywood legend Greta , believes that overweight people are the last group against which discrimination is still accepted .
" There 's no sensitivity , there 's no understanding , " she told the paper .
" [ People ] can make fun of you and nothing will happen to them for it . "
That is heavy .

This is one funny detention notice .
That 's not what she said .
INBOX : Sony launched personal music players in the 1970s .
Now it ’s trying to target the digital sector , writes MIKE BUTCHER
SONY IGNITED the personal music revolution in the late 1970s with the Walkman cassette player and , until the MP3 player came along , it reigned pretty much supreme .
But the Walkman ’s thunder was gradually stolen , first by the iPod , then the iPhone and the iPod Touch .
And it ’s the iPod Touch that Sony has returned to target with the Walkman X , due out this summer .
Alongside the ability to play many music file formats and the FM radio , the Walkman X sports the “ slacker radio ” feature , which allows you to select up to three stations , while hundreds of songs are pushed to your device free of charge .
The built - in Wi-Fi allows access to the web via a decent browser , YouTube videos and content updates .
But at about € 236 for the 16GB and €315 for the 32 GB model , this is not a cheap device .
If you just want something to listen to music , then look elsewhere .
The play / pause and skip buttons are easy to access up top , alongside the 3.5 mm headphone jack , reset and volume .
The inbuilt noise cancellation controls and software mean the sound quality is great , though this does not mean you get noise - cancelling with any headphones , only with the EX headphones supplied .
And there ’s one thing that reminds you of the iPod Touch : a large home button on the front which takes you back to the start screen from any application .
Definitely familiar .
A large semi-circular hold slider is on the back .
So far so good .
However , Sony shares its love of proprietary connections with Apple .
With other media players now sporting simple USB connections , the Walkman X has a non-standard one .
It ’s all rather tedious .
At least the Walkman shows up as a mass storage device , which means you can drag and drop music and files onto it .
And the granite - finished casing is sturdy .
However , it ’s the Organic Light Emitting Diode ( OLED ) screen that is the draw here .
At three inches , the 432 x 240 screen can be touched to be controlled .
This is not a multitouch interface in the same manner as the iPod Touch but video , photos and album art are made to shine on this amazing screen .
OLED screens are a long - winded way of saying that they do not require a backlight to function , unlike LCDs .
That means they draw less power and the device ’s battery can last longer .
Without the need for a backlight , an OLED display can also be much thinner than a normal LCD panel .
In theory , there is a lot about a device that has an OLED screen which could start threatening the iPod Touch .
There is also a slight issue here , to do with the future for personal media players like this : to what extent should they become mini-computers ?
The iPod Touch can already run third - party applications from a very well populated iTunes store .
Sony has no such store at present , which limits the Walkman X to the applications it comes with .
I think we can be confident that Sony wo n’t be resting on its laurels on that score , but until then the iPod Touch is still the one to beat .
A doctor from the area , who did not want to be named , said a group of Taliban entered his clinic before taking him to a place were several fighters were injured .
He said he treated the Taliban , numbering around six or seven , before being asked to leave .
Bob Baxley , a soon - to - be - loyal MR reader , asks me the following question :
In considering entering in an online drawing for a bicycle , I read the complete rules .
The contest is billed as a random drawing of those entered .
But what struck me is that " Before being declared a winner , the selected entrant must first correctly answer , unaided , a time - limited , arithmetical , skill - testing question . " ( http://www.cervelo.com/contestrules.aspx)
Curious about the occurrence of this rule in other contests , I Googled this long phrase and it turns out it is very common in contest drawings : ( http://www.google.com/search?hl=en&rlz=1C1GGLS_enUS291US305&q= "correctly+answer,+unaided,+a+time-limited,+arithmetical,+skill-testing+question." &btnG=Search ) .
Shorter snippets of this phrase return even more Google hits .
Any thoughts on why this stipulation is listed in the rules ?
Maybe his contest is offering up this question to me .
But I can not answer it unaided .

HELSINKI ( Reuters ) - Norway ’s Opera Software released on Wednesday the first test version of Opera 10 , the newest version of its browser , promising faster downloads , new design and new features .
A screenshot of the Opera 10 browser is seen in this undated handout image .
REUTERS / Opera Software
Opera is the world ’s third - largest browser maker , but is far behind Microsoft and Mozilla Foundation .
Competition in the browser market has escalated lately after Google launched its own Internet browser , Chrome , in 2008 .
“ Your Web browser is the most important piece of software you will ever use , ” Opera ’s Chief Executive Jon von Tetzchner said in a statement .
“ We think Opera 10 will redefine how you can enjoy the Web . ”
Opera said the new browser is more than 40 percent faster than its previous browser on resource - intensive pages such as Gmail and Facebook , and adds features like full thumbnails of all open tabs .
Companies usually release several successive test versions of their browsers so they can incorporate user feedback in a series of improvements before their final launch .
Microsoft launched its latest IE8 browser in March after a year of public beta testing .
Microsoft ’s Internet Explorer is used for about 60 percent of global Internet traffic , Mozilla ’s Firefox has about 30 percent , and Opera is at 4 percent , just ahead of Google and Apple , according to Web analytics firm StatCounter .
Opera , Mozilla and Google have protested Microsoft ’s dominance in the browser market to the European authorities .
Microsoft has run afoul of U.S. and European antitrust regulators for bundling its browser with its operating system , which competitors say is an attempt to drive them out of the market .
In January , European regulators brought formal charges against Microsoft for abusing its dominant market position by bundling its Internet Explorer Web browser with its Windows operating system , which is used in 95 percent of the world ’s personal computers .
Opera has a small share of the desktop browser market , but its mobile browser is the most widely used browser on handsets .

Advertisement A table of young people 's wellbeing in 29 European states - the EU plus Norway and Iceland - has ranked the UK 24th .
The Netherlands was top while only Romania , Bulgaria , Latvia , Lithuania and Malta came lower than the UK .
The table , about youngsters aged up to 19 , was compiled by York University researchers for the Child Poverty Action Group using mostly 2006 data .
The government commented that its policies were lifting more than a million children out of poverty .
The researchers assessed the countries on 43 separate measures , ranging from infant mortality and obesity to material resources - like poverty and housing .
Table : Youth wellbeing rankings
Also included were how children felt about their lives , schools and relationships .
CATEGORIES health subjective wellbeing relationships material resources behaviour and risk education housing and environment Feeling pressured by schoolwork , for example , fed into the measurement of " subjective wellbeing " .
The study suggests little improvement since a similar report by Unicef two years ago , BBC correspondent James Westhead said .
The Netherlands led overall and was also in the upper third of the table in each area .
Scandinavian countries dominated .
The UK's rank of 24th was well below the position which might be expected given its affluence , the Child Poverty Action Group ( CPAG ) report said .
Workless Britain's best score , 15th , was in children 's relationships - including how easy they say they find it to talk to their parents and get on with their classmates .
On material resources , the UK was 24th out of the 26 countries for which data was available .
" The UK position is particularly influenced by the high number of children living in families where no parent works .
Only Lithuania and Poland do worse , " said the report .
CPAG is not arguing against government policy focusing on income growth for the poorest families and the impact of public services .
But it says the current recession means many families are threatened with rapid income falls .
" There is nothing inevitable about the UK doing badly on child wellbeing , " it says .
" The challenge should be to reverse this situation and put children front and centre of policy making . "
Looking beyond 2010 , the charity has a series of recommendations : Protect jobs , remove barriers to work such as unsuitable and expensive childcare .
Mend the " safety net " which it says leaves many families struggling well below the official poverty line .
Drop means tests in favour of universal benefits such as child benefit .
Stop in - work poverty from low wages .
End the " classroom divide " in which children growing up in poverty have lower attainment .
Provide fair public services for those who need them most .
End " poverty premiums " which mean poor families pay more for basic goods , utilities and services and more of their income in taxes .
Ensure a decent home for every family .
CPAG says that as most of the data in the report is from three years ago - which is not unusual in international comparisons - many recent government policy initiatives are not fully reflected .
" The figures should therefore be read as a criticism of UK society , but not necessarily of recent social policy , " it stresses .
England 's children 's minister , Beverley Hughes , added that the fact that a government department had been created to focus on children , schools and families showed the increased importance being given to children .
" Our Children 's Plan is our long term vision and it puts children and families at the centre of everything government does , " she said .
" Our policies have lifted 600,000 children out of poverty and halved absolute poverty .
Policies announced in the last two years will lift around a further 500,000 children out of poverty .
" We are very proud that the majority of our children are happy and do well but in those cases where children and their families face problems , we will continue to invest in high quality services which provide the vital help and support that they need . "
The CPAG report follows a BBC Newsround survey of 1,000 children around the UK .
Many were worried about money , bullying and knife crime - but most nevertheless said they were happy .

Though there are already plenty of instructables that cover this topic , I thought my list would n't be complete without including the simplest way to get clean , healthy hair .
No soap required !
No Poo Shampoo Ingredients :
1 tsp Baking soda
Apple cider vinegar
4 oz Water
Put 1 tsp baking soda in a cup or mug to take into the shower with you .
In another cup , pour about 1 oz ( ~1/ 8 cup ) apple cider vinegar .
When you get into the shower , fill the baking soda cup with about 1 / 4 c water .
Apply this to your roots only ; work it in and let it sit for a minute .
Then begin to gently scrub your scalp , stimulating blood flow and cleaning out your pores .
This will actually stimulate hair growth .
Lastly , scrub the back of your skull and your temples / sideburns .
This will result in less grease and more growth .
Rinse !
Follow by adding about 1 / 4 c water to your vinegar cup .
Pour the apple cider vinegar over the ends of your hair , let it sit for a minute and then rinse it out .
No ' Poo Troubleshooting
There may be a transition period from two weeks to two months depending on the person .
Here are a few tips :
If your hair becomes frizzy , try using less baking soda or leaving it on for a shorter period of time .
Adding honey may also help .
If your hair becomes greasy , try using less apple cider vinegar , switching to lemon or lime juice , leaving out the honey , and / or using a comb instead of a brush .
Also , make sure youre applying the apple cider vinegar just to the ends of your hair .
If your scalp itches , try the following essential oils ; tea tree , lavender , rosemary .
If your hair becomes dry , try a tiny bit of oil ( any oil , I use olive ) smoothed on bottom of hair .
Have fun and enjoy !

It is not yet known how many US embassies will issue invitations
For the first time since 1980 , the US has authorised its embassies around the world to invite Iranian diplomats to Independence Day receptions .
The move is part of a new policy of engagement with Iran under President Barack Obama 's administration .
The US is trying to convince Iran to end its nuclear ambitions .
It is still unclear how many embassies will send out invitations to the celebrations on 4 July and whether Iranian diplomats will attend .
Small talk
The decision to invite Iranian diplomats to an American reception is a symbolic gesture but it puts an end to almost 30 years of a US policy discouraging even informal contacts with Iranian officials .
It is not yet known whether Iranians from Tehran 's interest section in Washington will be invited to the 4 July reception at the State Department .
The two countries have no diplomatic relations and the ban on substantive discussions remains in place , but this 4 July American diplomats will be allowed to go beyond the courtesy handshake and engage in small talk with their Iranian counterparts .
The move is in line with the Obama administration 's attempts to engage diplomatically with America 's long - time foe .
Iran 's reaction has been mixed so far and it has yet to respond to an offer of incentives from the US and its partners in return for stopping uranium enrichment .

For years , it 's been a notoriously popular internet meme to remix the " bunker scene " from the 2004 film " Downfall . "
In the original scene , actor Bruno Ganz portrays Adolf Hitler 's ranting breakdown in the final days of the Third Reich .
In the hands of internet remixers , the scene 's English - language subtitles have been modified to transform it into commentary on everything from the subprime mortage crisis to breakfast theft .
There 've even been meta - commentaries on the meme itself .
EFF Board Chairman Brad Templeton recently remixed his own version , with Hitler ranting about troubles with DRM and the failure of DMCA takedowns to prevent fair uses .
Take a look , and then keep reading to see what Brad 's experience making it tells us about fair use and the DMCA .

Unfortunately for Brad , he found in making his parody that creating a fair use like this — and doing so legally — is not as easy as it ought to be .
As a high profile advocate for digital rights , Brad naturally wants to avoid breaking any laws .
And while fair use protects his parody from charges of copyright infringement , he wanted to ensure that he did n't accidentally violate other laws — in particular the DMCA 's prohibition on circumventing encryption .
This meant that Brad could n't just rip a copy from the his own legally purchased DVD .
Instead , just to be safe , he would have to make a copy of the film using the " analog hole , " a form of copying that has been recognized by the courts as legally permissible .
But that approach brought multiple headaches , as Brad notes on his blog :
So I got a copy of the movie , and discovered that the U.S. edition of the film has the English subtitles encoded right into the video .
Normally subtitles are in their own file and can be turned on and off , but not in this edition .
Brad had to buy a European version of the film , which comes with optional subtitles , but this meant hassling with region code restrictions :
One can get region 2 DVD players , but the easiest way to play one is to get a PC with a DVD drive .
The Windows software DVD players all let you set the region code when you first use them , some let you change it a few times but wo n’t let you change it after that .
I have so many PCs and DVD players that it is no bother to me to set one to region 2 , and so I did .
It was able to play the video out the S - video port , and I connected that to my linux box with a video capture card , the same one that records my Cable TV for me .
The upshot is that Brad was able to create a brilliant parody — with a nice tip of the hat to EFF 's work protecting fair uses like this one from bogus takedown notices — but only after weeks of hassling with various technical problems that would make most people throw up their hands in frustration .
This is a perfect example of why EFF has been advocating for DMCA exemptions for this sort of activity .
No one should have to surmount these sorts of technical barriers just to make use of their legally protected free speech rights !
Ten Rangitoto College pupils have tonight tested positive for influenza with health officials saying they consider it " likely " they have swine flu .
Swine flu is believed to have killed more than 80 people in Mexico and over 1300 are sick as a result of catching the virus which has also hit parts of the United States .
Do you know someone affected ?

Health officials said tonight there were also three other high schools at risk with pupils from Northcote College having recently returned from Mexico , while Pinehurst and Westlake Girls High also had pupils in the United States and South America .
Health Minister Tony Ryall said most of the flu- affected pupils from Rangitoto College were on the " road to recovery " , but other pupils had since come down with flu - like symptoms .
Twenty - two pupils and three teachers were on the trip with 14 showing flu - like symptoms .
The affected pupils were being kept in isolation at home along with their family members .
One pupil was taken to hospital on Saturday , but was not in a serious condition .
Dr Darren Hunt , deputy director of public health , said it could take days till they knew whether the influenza was H1N1 swine flu - a subset of Influenza A .
Melbourne health authorities were being contacted and would carry out the tests .
Until results were known , health officials are treating the situation as if the victims had swine flu and have upgraded the country ’s health alert status to " code yellow " .
" I think it is important to recognise the concern that we have and [ that ] the deaths that have been reported from Mexico .
" At the same time the cases that have been reported from the United States seem to be relatively mild and there have n't been any deaths reported from the US , " Dr Hunt said .
While it was a new flu strain , patients that had been treated with Tamiflu had responded , he said .
At this stage health officials had no plans to order more Tamiflu as pharmacies still had " quite a bit in stock , " Health Ministry pandemic planning co-ordinator Steve Brazier said .
Officials stressed however , that anyone with flu symptoms should visit their doctor and not treat themselves .
Doctors and nurses would also be stationed at Auckland International Airport from early tomorrow to screen for possible symptoms from travellers landing from North and Central America .
Officials would also seek fellow passengers onboard Air New Zealand 's NZ1 Los Angeles flight that landed early yesterday and carried the affected Rangitoto College pupils for testing .
They could not say whether it was likely that other passengers onboard the Air NZ flight could have contracted the virus , but it was of concern .
" These people on the plane … may have been infected , " Dr Hunt said .
Anyone who had gone to Mexico or North America should urgently contact their doctors if they felt unwell , he said .
Air New Zealand said tonight that 364 passengers were onboard the NZ1 flight .
The airline said it was is in close contact with the Auckland district health board and the Health Ministry and reiterated advice that passengers onboard should consult with their GP or other health professionals if they developed flu - like symptoms .
" Air New Zealand is supplying that same information to its crew through its medical team , " it said in a statement .
Middlemore Hospital had released Tamiflu to the Auckland Regional Public Health Service to treat the patients and people who had been in contact with them .
The Ministry was in contact with the World Health Organisation and was liaising with Australia in terms of their response .
The Ministry was also working closely with Auckland Regional Public Health , district health boards and other Government agencies including MAF , Customs and the Ministry of Education .
It would keep New Zealanders informed of developments , Mr Ryall said .

Opposing attorneys agreed on little during Phil Spector ’s six - month murder retrial .
But Tuesday , the day after the music producer ’s conviction , the lawyers reached the same conclusion about why the outcome was so different from the first trial : the jury .
Jurors in Spector ’s first trial in 2007 spent a dozen days in contentious deliberations before announcing that they were hopelessly deadlocked .
Relying on mostly the same witnesses and exhibits , the jury in the retrial convicted him after nine days of deliberations apparently marked by little if any discord .
There was “ nothing and everything ” different in the trials , said a prosecutor who tried both cases .
“ Nothing in that it was the same evidence presented to both juries , but everything because they were different people , ” Deputy Dist .
Atty .
Alan Jackson said .

Spector ’s attorney agreed .
“ The principal difference this time was the jury , ” said Doron Weinberg .
Spector is jailed pending his May sentencing .
A judge is expected to sentence him to a mandatory life sentence with the possibility of parole after at least 18 years .
The route the jurors followed to arrive at a conviction remains something of a mystery .
Only the forewoman has spoken publicly , and her brief remarks at a news conference were vague .
But those involved in the case say she may have revealed the most crucial difference between the panel and its predecessor when she broke down in tears while praising her fellow jurors ’ unity and dedication .

“ I do n’t think these people were willing to fight each other , ” Weinberg said .
“ They wanted to come to a consensus . ”
The panel that convicted the 69 - year - old Spector gelled , while the 2007 jury that hung fractured .
The foreman in that case voted not guilty in the face of 10 colleagues who insisted that prosecutors had proved Spector guilty beyond a reasonable doubt in the fatal shooting of actress Lana Clarkson .
Another juror vacillated and ultimately voted with the foreman .
The hung jury was a searing defeat for prosecutors .
Spector remained free on $ 1 - million bail during the six years the case played out .
He lived in his mansion and even got married .
Although Spector ’s defense had argued for an acquittal , his attorney acknowledged Tuesday that a more realistic goal for the retrial was a second deadlock .
Spector was accused of inviting Clarkson back to his 30 - room residence for a late - night drink and then placing a snub - nosed revolver in her mouth and pulling the trigger when she tried to curtail the liaison .
His defense claimed the shooting was suicide .

“ The visceral parts of this case are really too strong to allow an acquittal , so it ’s really a case that should end in a hung jury .
But you need people who will stand by their principles , ” Weinberg said .
The first trial had those “ very strong and principled people , ” but the second case did not , the lawyer said .
When jury selection began last fall , the prosecution vowed to avoid jurors like the previous foreman .
Jackson said he believed that the juror -- who did not return calls seeking comment -- got hung up on details and missed the larger picture .
He was an engineer who filled more than a dozen notebooks during the trial .
For the next jury , the prosecutor said , “ I wanted common sense to be just dripping off the panel , as opposed to over - analysis . ”
Advertisement
Howard Varinsky , the jury consultant who helped prosecutors pick the panel , said they steered clear of anyone who seemed “ persnickety or super - detailed . ”
The final jury of six men and six women included analytical minds -- a research scientist and a retired engineer -- but no one who struck Varinsky as a loner .
During the five months of testimony , both sides noticed the jurors treating one another more and more as friends or family .
They celebrated birthdays and laughed uproariously during lunch breaks .
When one panelist had a cold , the forewoman fetched her a cough drop .
Deputy Dist .
Atty .
Truc
Do said the developments heartened her .

“ That does n’t say which way they are going to go , but it tells you this is a group that will work together , ” she said .
Weinberg said that some jurors struck him in jury selection as being particularly open to the defense but that the dishes of shared food and the budding friendships were not fertile ground for individual jurors to reject the majority view .
“ The people who thought the evidence was n’t there allowed themselves to be convinced , ” Weinberg said .
But Jackson said the cohesion allowed jurors to focus on “ the forest and not the trees . ”

“ We had a more reasonable jury this time , ” he said .

THE number of people subscribing to broadband in OECD countries increased by 13 % last year to 267m .
More than a fifth of the combined population of the 30 mostly rich nations in the OECD now have high - speed access to the internet .
The broadband penetration rate is above a third in Denmark , the Netherlands , Norway and Switzerland .
Adoption is lowest in poorer countries such as Mexico , where just over 7 % are broadband subscribers .
Slovakia enjoyed the fastest growth in broadband subscriptions per person .
Those subscribers , however , paid most for their connection , once exchange rates were adjusted for local spending power .
On that basis , Slovaks shelled out over twice as much for speedy internet access as broadband users in Britain or Japan .

why life has a bias to the left
Molecules that make life possible often have a leftward skew in their structure .
Now we think we know why and how that happened .
As the faux conservative pundit Stephen Colbert warned President Bush , reality has a bias to the left .
And interestingly enough , so does all life on Earth .
We ’ve know that all amino acids , the essential components for any terrestrial organism , have left - handed chiralities .
Or to translate from science - speak , their molecules wind to the left .
This is why genetic engineering experiments can splice genes from very different species in a lab .
The molecules will line up and assemble correctly because they ’re all wound in the same direction .
But for many years , there ’s been a nagging problem .
Why does all life on our planet have these left - handed amino acids ?
You could very easily wind them to the right and they ’d work just as well .
In fact , you could get an identical biosphere with a different chirality .
Of course you would have a very hard time finding a viable organism with both chiralities since the molecules it had to produce could n’t match up .
It would be like fitting together two different jigsaw puzzles and that means somewhere along the line , there had to be a process which resulted in our present day left - hand chirality gaining dominance over its rightward - wound counterparts .
Could it be one the earliest cases of natural selection at work ?
Actually , it seems that primordial chemistry in the vacuum of space played a major role in what life could evolve on our world .
This is the conclusion of NASA astrobiologists Daniel Garvin and Jason Dworkin who examined meteorites rich in carbon to find the amino acid isovaline .
Since isovaline is n’t actively used by living things on Earth and maintains the same chirality over billions of years , scientists can use it to take a look back at the dawn of the solar system and determine the ratio of left - handed to right - handed molecules without the threat of biological contamination .
As it turns out , when a meteorite is rich with water , it has up to 18 % more left - handed isovaline so when meteors with disproportionate amounts of left - handed amino acids fell to Earth and deposited their organic cargo , they would ’ve created a bias towards organisms with our current chirality .
Once again , we ’re finding evidence of life on our world coming from the depths of outer space as organic compounds ready to combine into functional organisms and just take it from there .
And that raises some curious questions .
Could life on other planets be very similar to ours ?
Is there a chance that alien and terrestrial hereditary mechanisms would be similar since they ’re built from the same pool of left - handed organics ?
To be perfectly clear , being made of similar compounds does n’t mean aliens would look anything like us .
Evolution and the environment of their home world would shape their anatomy .
Just look at the variety of life that evolved on our planet from the same 20 amino acids .
Who knows what the conditions on another planet could do with the same basic mix of chemical compounds ?
See : Glavin , D. , & Dworkin , J. ( 2009 ) .
Enrichment of the amino acid L - isovaline by aqueous alteration on CI and CM meteorite parent bodies Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences , 106 ( 14 ) , 5487 –5492 DOI : 10.1073/pnas.0811618106
Studies show that top navigations tend to get the most visual attention when a user first visits a site .
Having organized and intuitive navigation is key — and while most drop down menus may look aesthetically pleasing , developing them to degrade gracefully is also essential .
In this tutorial I would like to go over how to create a sexy drop down menu that can also degrade gracefully .
According to this blog , CSS is becoming increasingly powerful , and with features like CSS grid and Custom Properties ( also called CSS Variables ) , we can implement a lot of truly creative solutions .
Some of these solutions aim not only to make the Internet more attractive but also more accessible , improve the experience of creating accessible styles .
The common user interface template we see on the Internet is a drop - down menu .
They are used to display linked information in more detail , without the need for a large number of buttons , text , and settings .
They are most often used for headline areas and site navigation .

Step1 . HTML
First create an unordered list for your base top navigation .
Then simply nest another unordered list for your sub navigation .
< ul class = " topnav " > < li > < a href= " # " >
Home </a></li> < li > < a href= " # " > Tutorials </a> < ul class=" subnav " > < li > < a href= " # " >
Sub Nav Link </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Sub Nav Link </a></li> </ul > </ li > < li > < a href= " # " >
Resources </a> < ul class=" subnav " > < li > < a href= " # " >
Sub Nav Link </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Sub Nav Link </a></li> </ul > </ li > < li >< a href= " # " > About Us </a></ li > < li >< a href= " # " >
Advertise </a></li> < li >< a href= " # " >
Submit</a></li> < li >< a href= " # " > Contact Us</a></li> </ul >
Step2 . CSS
Next , it ’s time to style the navigation wireframe with CSS .
ul.topnav { list - style : none ; padding : 0 20 px ; margin : 0 ; float : left ; width : 920 px ; background : # 222 ; font- size : 1.2em ; background : url( topnav_bg.gif ) repeat-x ; } ul.topnav li { float : left ; margin : 0 ; padding : 0 15px 0 0 ; position : relative ; /*-- Declare X and Y axis base for sub navigation --*/ } ul.topnav li a{ padding : 10 px 5 px ; color : # fff ; display : block ; text - decoration : none ; float : left ; } ul.topnav li a:hover { background : url( topnav_hover.gif ) no -repeat center top ; } ul.topnav li span {
/*-- Drop down trigger styles --*/ width : 17 px ; height : 35 px ; float : left ; background : url( subnav_btn.gif ) no -repeat center top ; } ul.topnav li span.subhover { background - position : center bottom ; cursor : pointer ; } /*-- Hover effect for trigger --*/ ul.topnav li ul.subnav { list - style : none ; position : absolute ; /*-- Important - Keeps subnav from affecting main navigation flow --*/ left : 0 ; top : 35 px ; background : # 333 ; margin : 0 ; padding : 0 ; display : none ; float : left ; width : 170 px ; border : 1 px solid # 111 ; } ul.topnav li ul.subnav li{ margin : 0 ; padding : 0 ; border - top : 1 px solid # 252525 ; /*-- Create bevel effect --*/ border - bottom : 1 px solid # 444 ; /*-- Create bevel effect --*/ clear : both ; width : 170 px ; } html ul.topnav li ul.subnav li a { float : left ; width : 145 px ; background : # 333 url( dropdown_linkbg.gif ) no -repeat 10 px center ; padding - left : 20 px ; } html ul.topnav li ul.subnav li a :hover {
/*-- Hover effect for subnav links --*/ background : # 222 url(dropdown_linkbg.gif ) no -repeat 10 px center ; }
Step3 . jQuery
For those who are new to jQuery , you can learn about it here .
The following script contains comments explaining which jQuery actions are being performed .
$ ( document ) .ready ( function ( ) { $ ( " ul.subnav " ) .parent ( ) .append ( " < span ></span > " ) ; //
Only shows drop down trigger when js is enabled ( Adds empty span tag after ul.subnav * ) $ ( " ul.topnav li span " ).click ( function ( ) { // When trigger is clicked ...
// Following events are applied to the subnav itself ( moving subnav up and down ) $ ( this ) .
parent ( ) .find (" ul.subnav " ).slideDown ( ' fast ' ) . show ( ) ; // Drop down the subnav on click $ ( this ) .
parent ( ) .hover ( function ( ) { } , function ( ) { $ ( this ) .
parent ( ) .find (" ul.subnav " ).slideUp( ' slow ' ) ; // When the mouse hovers out of the subnav , move it back up } ) ; // Following events are applied to the trigger ( Hover events for the trigger ) }).hover ( function ( ) { $ ( this ) .addClass ( " subhover " ) ; // On hover over , add class " subhover " } , function ( ) {
// On Hover Out $ ( this ).removeClass ( " subhover " ) ; //
On hover out , remove class " subhover " } ) ; } ) ;
* To degrade gracefully , we only show the drop down menu trigger to those who have javascript enabled .
This is what it looks like when javascript is disabled :

In the latest in the Village People series , Newsnight 's David Grossman examines whether MPs ' expense allowances are really just peanuts compared to other government budgets .
Fearing a potential battle over the massive $ 83.4 billion “ emergency ” war funding bill , Congressional Democrats have dropped the $ 50 million dollars the Obama Administration had sought to close the detention center at Guantanamo Bay from the bill .
Though President Obama had promised to close the facility , Republicans opposed to the deal argued it might lead to releasing some of the innocent detainees into the United States and Sen.
McConnell predicted it would “ significantly delay the passage of this legislation . ”
The bulk of the bill was to continue funding the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan – which seems uncontroversial across both houses of Congress .
After running a campaign harshly critical of the Guantanamo detention system , the administration has largely abandoned its early promises to close to facility , and is now talking openly about restarting the Bush - era military tribunal system , long criticized for the dubious legality .
Losing the allocation for closing the facility may well be the excuse needed for the president to abandon any pretense of working toward that end .

It 's easy to spend a lot of money in San Francisco on food , lodging and entertainment - whether you live here or you 're visiting .
And quite frankly , times are tough : With unemployment hitting 8.8 percent in San Francisco , and nearly 300,000 Bay Area residents searching for jobs , people are thinking twice about spending money on anything but the essentials .
Luckily , there are plenty of free things to do that have that only - in - San Francisco vibe and can be enjoyed by residents and tourists alike .
Some are fun , some are informative , some offer a little of both .
There are those that require planning and others that can be done on the fly .
Below , we offer 10 possibilities from which to choose .
Glass elevators at the St. Francis :
The five high - speed elevators at the St. Francis , the landmark hotel at 335 Powell St. , zip visitors up to the 31st floor ( the 32nd floor is usually reserved for private parties ) and offer spectacular views of Coit Tower , the Financial District skyline , the East Bay and Union Square below .
Farmers ' markets : San Francisco boasts several markets throughout the week , but the two star attractions take place on Saturdays and together provide a snapshot of San Francisco 's rich cultural diversity and a taste of the season 's best offerings .
Many stalls offer free tastes .
The Alemany Market , known by locals as the " people 's market , " gets packed soon after the stalls open at 6 a.m .
Go elbow - to - elbow to get bok choy , green beans , fresh sugar cane and oranges .
The market runs from 6 a.m. to 3 p.m. , 100 Alemany Blvd. , tucked between Bernal Heights and southbound Interstate 280 .
The Ferry Plaza Farmers Market , pricier than Alemany , officially opens at 8 a.m. , but many regulars get there 15 minutes early to beat the crowds .
The waterfront market has been at the forefront of promoting locally grown , organic produce and has become a favorite of local chefs .
Stroll the stalls and pick up a fresh shot of wheatgrass juice or an heirloom tomato .
The market operates Saturdays from 8 a.m. to 2 p.m. and Tuesdays from 10 a.m. to 2 p.m. , at the Ferry Building on the Embarcadero , near the foot of Market Street .
Wave Organ : Listen to the waves and wind make music and take in beautiful bay views .
Created in 1986 , the acoustical art piece is best experienced at high tide .
The installation consists of 25 concrete and PVC pipes planted in the water .
Located on a jetty across from the Marina Green , at the end of Yacht Road .
The nearest major cross streets are Marina Boulevard and Lyon Street .
Seward Street slides :
Take a thrilling ride down the curved concrete slides at the Seward Street Mini Park in Noe Valley .
The side - by - side slides are fast and fun , and not for the faint of heart .
Bring a piece of cardboard or burlap to get the most out of the run .
Some users swear by plastic cafeteria trays .
Located on Seward Street , near the corner of Douglass Street .
Sunday service at Glide Memorial United Methodist Church :
The famously liberal church known for its diversity attracts movie stars and homeless people with its message of hope and the wall - shaking Glide Ensemble choir and band .
" Celebrations " are held at 9 and 11 a.m. , 330 Ellis St. , at Taylor Street , in the Tenderloin .
Ocean Beach bonfire :
One of the coolest ways to keep warm at night in San Francisco is to sit near a bonfire at Ocean Beach , where the city meets the Pacific .
Fires are restricted to the artist - created fire rings located between Fulton Street and Lincoln Way and are available on a first - come , first - served basis .
You can always find fires burning on Friday , Saturday and Sunday nights ; they must be extinguished by 10 p.m. Groups larger than 25 require a permit from the National Park Service .
For more information on the rules and regulations , go to www.nps.gov/goga.
Outdoor swing dance party : Every Sunday , except when it rains , the pavement in Golden Gate Park is turned into a dance floor , where folks of all ages can do the Lindy Hop and other swing dances .
What started out 13 years ago as a small gathering of friends now attracts 150 to 200 people every weekend and welcomes participants of all abilities , even the rhythmically challenged .
Lindy in the Park , as the group is known , runs 11 a.m. to 2 p.m. Sundays on JFK Drive , between Eighth and 10th avenues .
Note : Cars are not allowed on the east end of JFK on Sundays .
Open house visits :
Ever wonder what the inside of a Pacific Heights mansion looks like ?
Or whether a " Richmond Special " duplex feels as boxy on the inside as it looks on the outside ?
Every Sunday afternoon , dozens of single - family homes and condos up for sale open their doors to potential buyers and curious neighbors , providing people a chance to see how the other half lives .
Locations change weekly .
Check the Sunday newspaper or online real estate sites for specific times and addresses or look for " open house " signs on street corners .
Neighborhood walking tours :
For more than two decades , volunteer docents have led walking tours of San Francisco neighborhoods , some well known , such as Chinatown and the Mission , others more off the beaten path , such as Glen Park and Visitacion Valley .
The City Guides organization also offers tours that focus on a specific topic , such as murals , theater and the Gold Rush .
For a schedule of tours , go to www.sfcityguides.org or call ( 415 ) 557-4266 .
Board of Supervisors meetings : San Francisco 's legislative body meets most Tuesday afternoons at San Francisco City Hall to debate everything from public toilets and high - rise development projects to universal health care and civil rights .
The 11 - member board is where Harvey Milk and Dan White got their start in elected office , and where Sen. Dianne Feinstein and Mayor Gavin Newsom once served .
The board meets at 2 p.m. Tuesday .
City Hall is located at Van Ness Avenue and Grove Street .

IT IS hard to imagine a worse time to be entering the world of work .
Youngsters leaving school and university this autumn will face competition from a good part of the class of 2008 , who are still searching for jobs , as well as from more experienced workers who have recently been made redundant .
Hiring freezes favour those already in work over would - be entrants .
The most recent figures from Eurostat , the European statistics agency , suggest that youth unemployment , for many years low in Britain , is now higher than the euro - area average .
According to the Association of Graduate Recruiters , its members expect to be taking on 5 % fewer recruits this year than last , and starting salaries are frozen .
So rational youngsters are turning to delaying tactics , and sixth - form colleges and universities are seeing a boom in demand .
Despite a demographic decline in the number of 16 - year - olds , sixth - form colleges expect up to 35,000 more students this autumn than last .
Applications to universities are up by 34,000 , or nearly 8 % .
The government has worked to get young people studying longer .
It has raised the compulsory school - leaving age from 16 to 18 , to take effect in stages over the next few years , and wants half of all school - leavers to go on to university .
But just as its aims seem within reach , worsening public finances are getting in the way .
Earlier this month sixth forms learned , to their incredulity , that they would be receiving less government money this autumn than last .
Universities have been told to cut back too , with already - stingy plans to cover 15,000 extra undergraduate places cut to just 10,000 .
This is to plug a £ 200 m funding shortfall caused by the government 's decision in 2008 to extend means - tested grants to students from better - off families .
Teachers fear that , despite the extra teaching burden , colleges will make some of them redundant to balance the books .
They are threatening to strike if that is the result .
School and college heads are considering legal action against the government .
Just a few weeks earlier they had been told they would get enough money to meet the extra demand , and as a result many had already offered places for this autumn .
Some say they will have to abandon the most costly courses , in particular the new “ diploma ” , a semi-academic , semi-vocational qualification that they reckon is twice as expensive to run as A - levels .
Britain has a depressingly large number of NEETs , young people who are not in education , employment or training .
The extension of compulsory schooling was conceived partly as a way to tackle the problem , and the diploma was to make more years in school palatable .
If neither jobs nor adequate school and university places are available , what are young people to do ?
Early unemployment has lasting ill effects , including a higher risk of future unemployment and lower lifetime earnings .
The cash - strapped government may announce a bit more money for sixth - form places in the budget on April 22nd .
But some think it should be far bolder .
David Blanchflower , an economist and member of the Bank of England 's monetary - policy committee , suggests raising the school - leaving age immediately .
That would be expensive , he acknowledges , “ but the cost of not tackling the rise in unemployment may well be much greater ” .
Universities , though , are unlikely to be awarded more cash .
They have been warned that , if they admit more than their revised quota of students , they will get no extra money and will also be obliged to repay the government the additional loans and grants it pays to students .
Universities UK , the vice - chancellors ' lobbying group , says tens of thousands of would - be students could be left without places this autumn , despite having the grades to qualify .
Danny Dorling , a geographer at Sheffield University who has studied the effects of the spike in youth unemployment around 1980 on public health , thinks anything is better for young people than joblessness — but not all alternatives are equally good .
“ Make - work ” state schemes to mop them up are nearly as bad as doing nothing , his findings show , and temporary jobs only a bit better .
The best course is going to college or university .
It would be a pity if the current economic ill winds were prevented from blowing some good .

Many now see broadband access as a basic right UK consumers now believe broadband is becoming as essential a utility as electricity or water , according to a panel of government advisers .
Some 73 % of those questioned described a high - speed connection as important .
The Communications Consumer Panel 's research involved 16 focus groups and a face - to - face survey with 2,000 people across the UK .
Its findings will be submitted to Lord Carter 's Digital Britain review , due to be published on 16 June .
Missing out
It is expected that the report will include a government commitment to provide universal broadband at a speed of 2 M bps ( megabits per second ) by 2012 .
The chair of the Communications Consumer Panel Anna Bradley said : " The key message is that people think broadband is at a tipping point .
" It 's fantastically useful for everyone , essential for some now , but will be essential for everyone in the near future .
" It is being compared by consumers to gas and electricity - things which they think we all ought to have access to , almost as a right . "
Those questioned in the survey said people who did not have broadband would be at a disadvantage , missing out on services such as shopping , banking and public services as they were increasingly being delivered online .
The report showed that people currently value broadband for accessing information and for communicating , but a growing proportion are now using it for entertainment services , such as streaming TV content .
Government subsidy
The Consumer Panel , which advises the regulator Ofcom , said its research shows there is strong public support for universal broadband , which would need to be at a speed that allowed everyone to participate fully in society .
" While 2 M bps looks like it may be enough today it wo n't be tomorrow , " said Ms Bradley .
But she said consumers are more concerned about exactly what they can do with broadband than its speed .
" They want to know that they 're going to be able to download [ BBC ]
iPlayer , if that 's what they 're up to , that they 're going to be able to use Skype if that 's what they want .
" It 's the services that matter to consumers .
The government and companies need to tell us what it is going to allow us to do , not what speed it is at . "
Those questioned in the research had mixed views on whether the government should subsidise broadband .
Some felt that most people could now afford broadband , even if it meant doing without something else , but others felt the government should help those on low incomes to get online .
But there was broad support for government help for people in so - called " notspots " , where access to broadband is difficult or impossible .
Last week , a survey for the BBC found that as many as three million homes in the UK might need help to get online at a speed of 2 M bps .

The Corrections Corporation of America ( CCA ) held its 2008 fourth quarter investor conference call last month .
The private prison profitteers at CCA mentioned the company is suffering from the economic downtown that is facing other sectors .
The most clear reason given was the budget discussions happening at the state level and the potential impact on CCA contracts .
Corporate officials were very careful not to disclose too much information in the call that could impact CCA 's bottom line .
Specifically , they refused to mention which states the company was in current discussions with regarding contracted capacity .
We know that Texas is in the middle of it 's legislative session right now .
There is no doubt that CCA lobbyists are walking the halls of the state capitol in an attempt to protect it 's current contracted capacity and influence any opportunity to expand private capacity at the state or local level .
On the investor call , CCA mentioned that the average compensated prison bed occupancy grew to nearly 83,000 beds in 2008 from 75,000 in 2007 .
Additionally , there was a 5.5 % increase in average daily population of CCA capacity during 2008 .
In materials relating to the call , CCA lists the facility it owns and operates in Texas .
Those facilities are listed below .

In addition to CCA owned and operated facilities , the private prison company also contracts to manage facilities owned by the state of Texas -- another reason CCA lobbyists are probably running the halls of the capitol .

CCA officials also mentioned adding a potential customer in the Houston area this year .
According to company records , CCA would contract with Community Education Partners to operate a non secure facility for a design capacity that is not clear .
However , the alternative education facility is currently configured to house 900 juvenile detainees and could be expaned to accomadate a total of 1,400 juveniles .
According to the information above , CCA owns or manages over 13,200 beds in Texas .
That is quite a number .
We will keep you posted as CCA continues to update investors on it's profits .
One way to look at how the Bush administration redefined torture out of existence , so that it could , er , torture human beings , is to compare their criteria for " enhanced interrogation " with those for rape .
Raping someone need not leave any long - term physical scars ; it certainly does n't permanently impair any bodily organ ; it has no uniquely graphic dimensions - the comic book pulling - fingernail scenarios the know - nothings in the Bush administration viewed as torture ; and although it 's cruel , it 's hardly unusual .
It happens all the time in regular prisons , although usually by other inmates as opposed to guards .
It barely differs from the sexual abuse , forced nudity and psychological warfare inflicted on prisoners by Bush - Cheney in explicit terms .
Recall that smearing fake sexual blood on the faces of victims was regarded as brilliant interrogation by the Bushies in Gitmo - and its psychological effects were supposed to be heightened by Muslim sexual sensibilities .
And male rape would be particularly effective in destroying male Muslim self - worth and psychological integrity .
Rape almost perfectly fits , in other words , every criterion the Bush administration used to define " enhanced interrogation . "
So ask yourself : if Abu Zubaydah had been raped 83 times , would we be talking about no legal consequences for his rapist - or the people who monitored and authorized the rape ?
We want to hear what you think about this article .

On his radio show today , Rush Limbaugh continued to make the claim that water boarding is not torture .
Rush said that if somebody can survive water torture six times a day , then it is not torture .
He asked why the detainees did n’t complain to the lawyers if it was so bad .
Um , Rush they were n’t allowed to have lawyers .
Here is the audio courtesy of Media Matters :
Limbaugh claimed that it is n’t torture if a person can survive it , but the definition of torture is that it is pain delivered for the purposes of coercion or punishment .
The purpose of torture is to get information , and since dead people tell no tales , Rush ’s definition makes absolutely no sense .
By Rush ’s definition , if he was detained and someone burned the bottom of his foot every day , he would survive so this is not torture .
Advertisements
Limbaugh said that detainees should have complained to their lawyers and human rights groups .
Rush does n’t even get his facts correct here .
The Bush administration did not allow the detainees to have attorneys , until they lost a Supreme Court decision .
Human Rights groups were never given full access to GITMO .
Rush , they are n’t prisoners in jail .
They were labeled detainees so that the Bush administration could avoid giving them rights .
If Rush thinks water boarding is not torture , then let ’s water board him six times a day .
I am certain that he will survive , so by his definition , we will be doing nothing wrong .
Let ’s give it a try , and see how he feels about us afterwords .
Limbaugh also mocked John McCain for going on television and speaking out against torture .
I think Limbaugh has watched too many 24 episodes .
In essence , Rush is saying that John McCain , a man who spent years being tortured , does n’t know what he is talking about .
This is why Rush is leading the GOP to certain defeat .

Great tits are tweaking their tweets to be heard in noisy urban areas , but for their country cousins it is like they are speaking a different language .
Scientists at Aberystwyth University found male great tits in 20 UK towns and cities sang at a higher pitch to be heard above the man -made noise .
Rural birds were confused by urban bird song while city birds " did n't understand the lower rural pitch " .
The male great tit sings to defend his territory and attract a mate .
Research student Emily Mockford visited 20 towns and cities in the UK to capture the bird song .
The singing was played back to rural male tits during the breeding season when they are at their most aggressive , but there was a " slower and weaker " response than normal from the countryside birds .

Scientists also recorded countryside great tits and found they sang at a lower pitch and , in turn , city birds found the rural droll difficult to understand , the study found .
Project leader Dr Rupert Marshall explained how the city bird song was captured .
He said : " We just stood there and pointed a microphone at them ( the great tits ) .
" We went for medium - sized areas which were close to rural locations so that 's why we avoided London .
" We played the urban bird song on a speaker to rural males during the breeding season .
Usually this would provoke a strong reaction - the tits get quite worked up about it and would normally attack the speaker .
" But there was a slower and weaker response from the rural males .
Please turn on JavaScript .
Media requires JavaScript to play .
" They were less aggressive and not quite sure what to make of it .
It was like the city birds were speaking a different language .
" Likewise , we found city birds did n't understand the lower rural pitch . "
Project scientists said the urban great tit reacted to man-made noise by raising the pitch of its songs , but in quieter rural locations a few miles away the pitch was found to be lower .
PhD student Ms Mockford said : " The next step is to find out what the females make of these different songs - will they want to mate with a guy who sings too high or too low ? "

Dear Cecil : How lethal are Tasers ?
I know there 's talk about police being Taser - happy and torturing people with these devices , but has anyone been Tasered to death ?
Dugie C. , Calgary
Cecil replies :
News a little slow getting up to Calgary , Dugie ?
Lots of people have died after being Tasered — which is not to say they were necessarily Tasered to death .
According to a widely publicized Amnesty International study last year , 334 people in the U.S. plus 25 more in Canada died between 2001 and 2008 after being zapped with a Taser by cops .
The Taser ’s defenders say it beats shooting people and reduces the risk of stray bullets injuring bystanders .
Wrong argument , says AI .
The Taser is n’t a replacement for guns but rather for billy clubs and such — for a lot of cops it ’s become the default method of subduing the unruly .
OK , getting whupped upside the head in the old days was n’t a pleasant experience , but at least it did n’t involve 50,000 volts .
Taser is an acronym for “ Thomas A. Swift ’s electric rifle , ” a tribute to Tom Swift , boy - genius hero of a long - running kid ’s book series early last century .
( Taser inventor Jack Cover was a fan . )
Tasers work by firing two barbed nitrogen - propelled darts into skin or clothing , then delivering a high - voltage shock at low current .
They can also be used in “ drive stun ” mode , where the darts do n’t fire ; here you have to hold the weapon against the subject ’s body while pulling the trigger .
A well - aimed Taser shot reduces an uncooperative suspect to a twitching blob .
Being hit by 50,000 volts hurts like hell , and can cause vertigo , disorientation , and amnesia .
Taser darts can lacerate your skin ( sometimes requiring stitches ) and a couple of cases have been reported of Taser darts sticking in somebody ’s eye .
Does it get worse than that ?
Taser fans say no .
TASER International , maker of the device , compiled a database of reports on Tasered human subjects from 1999 to 2002 , which paints a rosy picture , claiming a few minor injuries and no deaths over 34 months .
A defense department study found the rate of severe injuries was only 0.6 percent , and police departments have claimed significant reductions in injury rates to both officers and suspects .
Amnesty International tells a different story , one that leaves lingering questions .
Alarming as a death toll of 359 sounds , it turns out to be difficult to tie them all to the Taser jolt .
AI admits as much : “ Amnesty International ’s review is not a scientific study , nor is the organization in a position to reach conclusions regarding the role of the Taser in each case . ”
What struck me when I reviewed the deaths was how few the medical examiner thought were directly attributable to the Taser .
In the huge majority of cases , drugs , alcohol , and / or poor health were cited as contributing factors .
Are MEs just covering up for the cops ?
Maybe , maybe not .
Medical journals speak of “ sudden in - custody death syndrome , ” which is enough to spike anybody ’s BS meter .
However , some experts insist that physical restraint that is n’t in itself lethal can combine with factors like heart disease and stimulant use to cause a hyperagitated state and often death in someone resisting arrest .
And that ’s without Tasers in the picture ; add a zap or two and it ’s hard to say exactly what ’s doing the victim in .
One study of Taser - coincident deaths from 2001 - ’05 showed more than half the victims had cardiovascular disease , more than 75 percent were on illegal drugs , and close to 90 percent were on some sort of stimulant ( including caffeine ) at the time of death .
Research has found police often use Tasers when a suspect is out of control and apparently under the influence — exactly , the theory goes , when the risk of SICDS is high .
In 2005 the Potomac Institute , a think tank , analyzed 72 cases of Taser - coincident death tabulated by AI and found some common threads : drug use by the suspect , physical restraint by the police , and no clear proof that the Taser was the cause of death .
Their conclusion ?
The risk of death due primarily to Taser was between 1 in 1,000 and 1 in 100,000 .
Let ’s put the issue squarely .
Amnesty International tells of officers Tasering schoolchildren , pregnant women , the elderly , etc — these jamokes should be fired .
But often cops have to get the cuffs on some raving lunatic they can’t just leave walking the streets .
Almost any sublethal method of persuasion carries risks .
Pepper spray can cause potentially fatal reactions , police dogs can do serious damage , plastic and bean - bag bullets can kill .
Nightsticks and choke holds I do n’t need to tell you about .
Tasering the guy presents a non-negligible chance you could kill him .
But what do you do instead ?

Mary ,
Mary quite contrary
Where does your image show ?
On tortillas and toast ;
perhaps the occasional roast –
And always with assholes in tow .
FORGIVE the terrible doggerel , but this was the first thing that sprang to mind when I learned this morning that another “ image ” of the Virgin Mary has made an appearance – this time in a Mexican restaurant in California .
Holy Mother of God decided to materialise on a griddle at the Las Palmas restaurant in the border town ofÂ Calexico – and promptly left the cook who first spotted herÂ in tears .
Said Brenda Martinez , who manages the family - owned restaurant :
She started to cry and did n’t want to clean the griddle anymore .
Martinez added that the cook believed that the image – another example of paradolia – had materialised to give her strength after her brother ’s fatal heart attack a few days earlier .
Mary is here for us .
She wants to show us her love and tell us to keep the faith .
According to this report , the griddle has now been taken off the stove and is displayed in a room behind the kitchen , which is rapidly filling up with rosaries , flowers , votive candles and other offerings left by visitors from the Imperial Valley and from Mexicali across the border .
Said Joe Acuna , who owns a landscaping firm .
I feel she is here with us .
I can feel her presence .
And handyman Mike Breseno said in Spanish .
She looks real , very real .
The Rev Edward Horning , associate pastor at St. Mary Catholic Church in nearby El Centro , examined the griddle but would not say whether he thought the outline on the griddle looked like the Virgin Mary .
He opined , however :
If God wants to do something like this , he can do it .
Yeah , but does God ever do anything USEFUL ?
Alberto Lopez Pulido , director and professor of ethnic studies at the University of San Diego , said that claims of apparitions , particularly of Mary , are not uncommon among Latino and Mexican Catholics .
The Catholic Church in Central and South America is Mary - centered , while the church in most of North America is more Christ - centered , Pulido said .
Seeing images of Mary in public places or work spaces fulfills the need of Catholics for a personal relationship to their religion outside the church , he said , adding :
In this week ’s issue of the magazine , Nick Paumgarten writes about the crisis on Wall Street .
On Tuesday , May 5th , he spoke with Nassim N. Taleb and Robert Shiller about the financial collapse at the New Yorker Summit .

TBILISI , Georgia —
Nearly eight months after the war between Russia and Georgia , Russian troops continue to hold Georgian territory that the Kremlin agreed to vacate as part of a formal cease - fire , leaving a basic condition of that agreement unfulfilled .
The Russian military , working with the governments and the small military forces of South Ossetia and Abkhazia , two separatist regions in Georgia , has stationed forces in two large swaths of territory that were under Georgian control before the war .
Observers and diplomats say Russia has also used attack helicopters and stationed tanks in areas where none existed before the war .
The sustained Russian military presence on land captured last summer — evident during two recent days spent in the area by two reporters — provides a backdrop of lingering disagreement between the West and Russia at a crucial time :
The Obama administration is pledging to recalibrate the relationship with Russia , restore cooperation in other areas and explore a new treaty on nuclear arms .
It also underscores the strength of Russia ’s military position in the southern Caucasus and its enduring confidence in undermining President Mikheil Saakashvili of Georgia and standing up to the West , even as Mr. Obama and President Dmitri A. Medvedev of Russia have signaled an intention to improve relations .
Mr. Obama and Mr. Medvedev met on Wednesday , and exchanged warm remarks and pledges to cooperate , raising questions in Tbilisi , Georgia ’s capital , about whether the United States would push to have the cease - fire plan fully honored .

North Korean students take part in a rally held to commemorate the June 25 Anti-U.S. Day in Shinchon , South Hwanghae province , North Korea , June 22 , 2009 in this picture released by North Korea 's official KCNA news agency on June 23 , 2009 .
REUTERS /KCNA
WASHINGTON ( Reuters ) - President Barack Obama on Wednesday renewed sanctions against North Korea , declaring that its nuclear program posed a national security risk to the United States and a danger to the Korean Peninsula .
The reclusive communist state has rebuffed U.S. efforts to engage it diplomatically and staged a second nuclear test on May 25 that was internationally condemned and led to the imposition of tougher sanctions the United Nations Security Council .
“ The current existence and risk of the proliferation of weapons - usable fissile material on the Korean Peninsula constitute a continuing unusual and extraordinary threat to the national security and foreign policy of the United States , ” Obama said in a notice to Congress .
The expanded U.N. sanctions ban all weapons exports from North Korea and most arms imports .
U.N. member states are also authorized to inspect North Korean sea , air and land cargo and destroy any goods that violate the sanctions .
Obama has said the U.S. military is prepared for the possibility that North Korea may attempt to launch a missile toward Hawaii in response to the new U.N. sanctions .
His decision to renew separate U.S. restrictions on Pyongyang was expected and followed a White House meeting last week with South Korean President Lee Myung - bak .
Obama promised then to end a cycle of allowing impoverished North Korea to create a nuclear crisis and then granting concessions in the form of food , fuel and other incentives to get Pyongyang to back down .
The North previously has reneged on promises it made in return for such aid .
Enlarge By Ahn Young - joon , AP South Koreans watch a television broadcasting an undated image of a North Korea launch missile at the Seoul Railway Station on Tuesday .
North Korea reportedly tested two more short - range missiles Tuesday , thumbing its nose at global powers hours after the U.N. Security Council condemned the regime 's provocative nuclear test .
The letters on the screen read " launched two short - range missiles . "
SEOUL ( AP )  North Korea threatened military action Wednesday against U.S. and South Korean warships plying the waters near the Koreas ' disputed maritime border , raising the specter of a naval clash just days after the regime 's underground nuclear test .
In Washington , Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton warned that Pyongyang faced unspecified consequences because of its " provocative and belligerent " acts .
Pyongyang , reacting angrily to Seoul 's decision to join an international program to intercept ships suspected of aiding nuclear proliferation , called South Korea 's decision tantamount to a declaration of war .
" Now that the South Korean puppets were so ridiculous as to join in the said racket and dare declare a war against compatriots , " North Korea is " compelled to take a decisive measure , " the Committee for the Peaceful Reunification of Korea said in a statement carried by state media .
The North Korean army called it a violation of the armistice the two Koreas signed in 1953 to end their three - year war , and said it would no longer honor the treaty .
South Korea 's military said Wednesday it was prepared to " respond sternly " to any North Korean provocation .
Clinton said " there are consequences to such actions , " referring to discussions in the United Nations meant to punish North Korea for its nuclear and missile tests .
She also underscored the firmness of the U.S. treaty commitment to defend South Korea and Japan , U.S. allies in easy reach of North Korean missiles .
North Korea 's latest belligerence comes as the U.N. Security Council debates how to punish the regime for testing a nuclear bomb Monday in what President Obama called a " blatant violation " of international law .
Ambassadors from the five permanent veto - wielding council members — the United States , Russia , China , Britain and France — as well as Japan and South Korea were working out the details of a new resolution .
The success of any new sanctions would depend on how aggressively China , one of North Korea 's only allies , implements them .
" It 's not going too far to say that China holds the keys on sanctions , " said Kim Sung - han , an international relations professor at Seoul 's Korea University .
South Korea , divided from the North by a heavily fortified border , had responded to the nuclear test by joining the Proliferation Security Initiative , a U.S. - led network of nations seeking to stop ships from transporting the materials used in nuclear bombs .
Seoul previously resisted joining the PSI in favor of seeking reconciliation with Pyongyang , but pushed those efforts aside Monday after the nuclear test in the northeast .
North Korea warned Wednesday that any attempt to stop , board or inspect its ships would constitute a " grave violation . "
The regime also said it could no longer promise the safety of U.S. and South Korean warships and civilian vessels in the waters near the Korea 's western maritime border .
" They should bear in mind that the ( North ) has tremendous military muscle and its own method of strike able to conquer any targets in its vicinity at one stroke or hit the U.S. on the raw , if necessary , " the army said in a statement carried by state media .
The maritime border has long been a flashpoint between the two Koreas .
North Korea disputes the line unilaterally drawn by the United Nations at the end of the Koreas ' three - year war in 1953 , and has demanded it be redrawn further south .
The truce signed in 1953 and subsequent military agreements call for both sides to refrain from warfare , but does n't cover the waters off the west coast .
North Korea has used the maritime border dispute to provoke two deadly naval skirmishes — in 1999 and 2002 .
On Wednesday , the regime promised " unimaginable and merciless punishment " for anyone daring to challenge its ships .
Pyongyang also reportedly restarted its weapons - grade nuclear plant , South Korean media said .
The Chosun Ilbo newspaper said U.S. spy satellites detected signs of steam at the North 's Yongbyon nuclear complex , an indication it may have started reprocessing nuclear fuel .
The report , which could not be confirmed , quoted an unidentified government official .
South Korea 's Yonhap news agency also carried a similar report .
The move would be a major setback for efforts aimed at getting North Korea to disarm .
North Korea had stopped reprocessing fuel rods as part of an international deal .
In 2007 , it agreed to disable the Yongbyon reactor in exchange for aid and demolished a cooling tower at the complex .
The North has about 8,000 spent fuel rods which , if reprocessed , could allow it to harvest 13 to 18 pounds ( six to eight kilograms ) of plutonium — enough to make at least one nuclear bomb , experts said .
North Korea is believed to have enough plutonium for at least a half dozen atomic bombs .
Further ratcheting up tensions , North Korea test - fired five short - range missiles over the past two days , South Korean officials confirmed .
Russia 's foreign minister said world powers must be firm with North Korea but take care to avoid inflaming tensions further .
The world " must not rush to punish North Korea just for punishment 's sake , " Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov said , adding that Russia wants a Security Council resolution that will help restart stalled six-nation talks over North Korea 's nuclear programs and will not provoke Pyongyang into even more aggressive activity .
South Korean President Lee Myung - bak urged officials to " remain calm " in the face of North Korean threats , said Lee Dong - kwan , his spokesman .
Pyongyang is n't afraid of any repercussions for its actions , a North Korean newspaper , the Minju Joson , said Wednesday .
" It is a laughable delusion for the United States to think that it can get us to kneel with sanctions , " it said in an editorial .
" We 've been living under U.S. sanctions for decades , but have firmly safeguarded our ideology and system while moving our achievements forward .
The U.S. sanctions policy toward North Korea is like striking a rock with a rotten egg . "

Sid Laverents , who started making movies in his Southern California basement after he turned 50 and became perhaps the most celebrated hobbyist in the amateur film world , his resourceful and dryly giddy work chosen for the National Film Registry , died on May 6 in Chula Vista , Calif .
He was 100 and lived in Bonita , Calif. , near San Diego .
The cause was pneumonia , said his wife , Charlotte .
Mr. Laverents was a jack of many trades , a perpetual self - inventor .
He played a dozen instruments and supported himself through the Depression as a vaudevillian one - man band ; he was also a sheet metal worker who helped build World War II airplanes , a self - published writer , a Fuller Brush salesman , a sign painter , a carpenter and an aircraft engineer .
But he was best known for the more than 20 movies he made from 1959 until his death , as a member of the San Diego Amateur Moviemakers Club .
They included nature films ( one about snails , filmed in his backyard ) , goofy comedies ( “ It Sudses and Sudses and Sudses , ” a “ Sorcerer ’s Apprentice ” - like tale about canisters of shaving cream run amok in the bathroom ) and deadpan autobiographical stories , including “ The Sid Saga , ” a four - part look at his own life , completed in his 80s .
Mr. Laverents had long been known to cineastes , members of amateur film clubs and other connoisseurs of noncommercial filmmaking , but in 2000 , at 92 , he got wider recognition after his “ Multiple SIDosis ” was included in the National Film Registry , a list of movies selected for preservation in the Library of Congress by the National Film Preservation Board .
It is one of a handful of amateur works so designated , including the Zapruder film of the Kennedy assassination .

( NewsTarget ) Red and processed meat in excess has long been suspected of being less than good for your health .
A recent study confirms that higher consumption of red and processed meat increases the risk of cancer , heart disease and other related illnesses .
The study was supported by the National Cancer Institute and was published in thein late March 2009 .
It is among the largest studies to date linking cancer , heart disease and other illnesses to red meat and processed meat consumption .
More than 500,000 men and women were included in the National Institutes of Health - AARP Diet and Health Study .
Participants were between 50 and 71 in age in 1995 when the study began .
Each person had to provide detailed information about what foods they were eating .
They were followed for 10 years and during this time Social Security Administration`s databases were used to track causes of death .
During the period of the study , 47,976 men and 23,276 women died .
People were divided into five categories .
These five categories were according to how much red and processed meat was consumed on a daily basis .
In this study red meat included bacon , beef , liver , pork , pork sausage , ham , hamburger , hot dogs , steak and meats found in pizza , stews , lasagna and related dishes .
Processed meat consisted of either red or white meat that was cured , dried or smoked such as bacon , lunch meats and cold cuts .
White meat included chicken , chicken mixtures , fish , turkey and other related meats .
The men and women who ate the most meat ( both red meat and processed meat ) had a higher overall risk of death during the study compared to those who ate the least red and processed meat .
Men who ate the most red meat had a 31 % higher overall risk of death during the study than those that ate the least red meat .
Women with the largest intake of red meat had a 50 % higher risk of death due to heart disease .
Study researcher Rashmi Sinha , PhD said that 11 % of deaths in men and 16 % of deaths in women could have been prevented if red meat intake had been lowered to the same amount as the lowest intake group .
The highest processed meat intakes were found to increase the risk of death by 16 % in men and 25 % in women .
Cancer risk increased 20 % in those who ate the most red meat and 10 % in those who ate the most processed meats .
White meat on the other hand showed protective qualities by slightly lowering the risk of death in the group that ate the most .
Sinha told WebMD that she could not make recommendations based on the study but that the results complement the advice of organizations such as the American Institute for Cancer Research .
The American Institute for Cancer Research recommends eating at most 18 ounces of red meat per week and avoiding processed meats altogether , because cancer risk starts to increase with any amount of processed meat .

Quantum Dots are getting a lot of attention lately , especially as a new SSL lighting technology .
One of the companies that is working on this new tech is QD Vision .
Their co-founder and CTO , Seth Coe -Sullivan has agreed to explain the technology , introduce the company , and answer a few questions .
Seth received his Ph.D in electrical engineering from MIT in 2005 , writing a thesis on incorporating quantum dots in hybrid organic / inorganic LED structure .
That 's the technology basis of QD Vision .
Seth was chosen as one of the top young entrepreneurs under the age of 30 by BusinessWeek .
QD Vision is a quantum - dot product company that delivers highly differentiated lighting solutions to major industries where color , power and design matter - these include lighting , displays , signage and defense .
QD Vision ’s Quantum Light™ platform enables step - change advances over other display and lighting solutions such as LCDs , plasma displays , LEDs and even organic LEDs ( OLEDs ) .
QD Vision is privately held , based in MA , US , and has several first - tier patents originating at MIT .
Q : Hello Seth , and thanks for agreeing to do this interview .
Can you explain your technology ?
What exactly * are * quantum dots ?
Quantum dots are tiny bits of semiconductor crystals with amazing optical properties that are determined not only by their material composition , but their size .
QD Vision synthesizes these materials in solution , and formulates them into inks and films that we sell to our customers , enabling step - change performance and cost benefits .
Our first products are Quantum LightTM optics for solid state lighting devices , and our customers offer the most efficient , highest color quality LED lighting solutions on the market today .
Q : How do quantum dots compare with OLED displays or lighting ?
Quantum LightTM optics for LED lighting differs from OLEDs in that the products using this technology will be on the market later this year .
In addition , the products last 50,000 hours , meet all of the color and efficiency requirements of the DoE's EnergyStar rating system , and are easy for existing manufacturers to integrate into their products without additional equipment purchases or even design changes .
Quantum LightTM is here and now , while OLEDs continue to be a future promise .
Q : I see that Quantum Dots can be used together with LEDs or OLEDs to create a display or lighting module .
Can you explain how these technologies work together ?
The Quantum LightTM platform enables quantum dots to be used to improve the performance of LEDs .
Quantum dots “ warm up ” the color of the light while increasing its quality ( color rendering index ) , delivering a superior blend of color quality and efficiency that cannot be achieved otherwise .
For OLEDs , our inorganic quantum dot technology can potentially replace the organic luminescent materials to provide superior color quality , efficiency , and lifetime .
In this solution , the organic charge transport layers from the OLED would simply deliver the charge to quantum dots instead of to an organic dye .
Q : Do you have any partners for OLED panels ?
We are collaborating with several Asian display partners to bring this quantum dot technology to market .
Q : It seems like you are putting more emphasis on lighting than on displays ... is that correct ?
Today , we are emphasizing the products that are ready - to - go , and those are for solid state lighting - correct .
However , we have active product development under way for both solid state lighting and displays .
Q : When do you expect your products to be available ?
Our first product , an LED lamp developed in partnership with Nexxus Lighting , will be available in the fourth quarter of this year .
Q : What will be the price of this lamp ?
Nexxus is currently using a $ 100 price target for this product .
Q : You have recently won a 700 K $ grant for the DOE to develop lighting tech .
Can you give us more info ?
This program focuses on using QDs to enhance a potential OLED - based lighting product .
The QD Vision team will develop and demonstrate a cost - competitive solution to increase extraction efficiency in OLEDs with efficient and stable color rendering index ( CRI ) for solid state lighting .
The end goal of our work with the DoE is practical solid state lighting solutions that are not only power efficient , but also emit light with highly pleasing color qualities .
Q : The last time you have raised money was in April 2008 ... will you require more funding ?
We do anticipate needing another round of funding before we reach cash - flow positive , but our mix of VC and government funding keeps our cash burn - rate extremely low for a 45 + person company .
Q : Where do you see the Display market in 5 years ?
What role will Quantum dots make ?
I think that LCD will continue to dominate the display market for the next five years , and will look like a very mature technology .
Quantum dots will be part of many LCD - based displays in their backlight units , enhancing color and efficiency and allowing LCD manufacturers to substantially reduce the cost of the backlight .
Q : Where do you see the Lighting market in 5 years ?
What role will Quantum dots make in lighting ?
I think that five years from now LEDs will have a significant market share in lighting , and that quantum dots will play a big role in their rapid adoption , by providing the warm color quality that consumers demand .
The focus on CFL technology will quickly turn to recycling and Mercury remediation , while incandescent bulbs will have been legislated out of existence .
Seth , thanks again for this interview .
We 'll be keeping an eye open on Quantum dots ... good luck to you and QD Vision !
A warehouse worker has been shortlisted for an Ivor Novello award for a song he wrote at home alone on New Year 's Eve with a bottle of vodka by his side following an upsetting encounter with an ex-girlfriend .
Nick Hemming , 35 , originally from Staffordshire , now finds himself in competition with Elbow and The Last Shadow Puppets after being shortlisted for the best song musically and lyrically at the Ivor Novello awards .
It is the first time in the awards ' 54 - year history that a self - published musician has been nominated in the prestigious category .
Hemming , who wraps fabric in a furniture warehouse , is a songwriter in little - known indie band The Leisure Society .
He has been nominated for the song The Last of the Melting Snow , which was self - published and self - produced .
He described yesterday how he wrote the song in a melancholy moment , having run into his ex-girlfriend .
" I went home for Christmas to Burton and I bumped into my ex who I was with for about eight years – I moved to London because we split up , " he said .
" She invited me back to her house , and I thought we were going to get back together , but instead she had invited me round to tell me about her new boyfriend . "
To escape , he went to London immediately but all of his friends were out of town , so as revellers celebrated the new year he sat inside drinking and writing about the end of his relationship .
The song received critical acclaim upon its release in December but did not gain widespread popularity .
On the release of The Leisure Society 's debut album , The Sleeper , Paul Mardles in the Observer wrote that it was wonderful , describing it as a " peculiarly English strain of Americana shot through with longing and a nagging sense of dread " .
Despite the plaudits Hemming remains working at the Osborne & Little fabric warehouse in Merton , south - west London .
" There are seven people in the band , so it 's difficult to make a living out of it , " he said .
" I work full - time but music has always been the main thing for me .
" At the moment I 'm working in a fabric warehouse , wrapping and packing fabric to send to America .
It 's mostly data entry and lifting stuff .
" I do n't really have to use my brain much , so it 's a perfect time to write lyrics . "
Previous winners of the award include George Harrison for Something and John Lennon and Paul McCartney for She 's Leaving Home , Pulp for Common People and Sting for Every Breath You Take .
The Ivor Novello Awards take place in London on May 21 .
It is the concentration of a few signaling molecules that determines the fate of individual cells during the early development of organisms , say a team of molecular biologists writing in Current Biology .
Pia Aanstad of the University of Innsbruck and colleagues report that a variety of molecular mechanisms accounts for the interpretation of the concentration of the signaling molecule Hedgehog .
The development of an organism is a complex process to which a dozen or hundreds of signaling molecules contribute .
Some of these molecules have dozens of functions in the fruit fly and in humans alike .
One of these molecules – Hedgehog – controls the development of , for example , the extremities , the central nervous system , the teeth , eyes , hair , lung and the gastrointestinal tract .
“ What is most remarkable :
The cells are told what to do not only because the molecule is present but also by the different concentrations of the molecules in the tissue ” , says group leader Pia Aanstad of the Institute for Molecular Biology .
The smo mutant embryo shows a loss of high levels of Hh signalling .
Whereas the Smo protein ( in red ) localises to the 2 micrometer long cilium ( in green ) , the mutant protein does not localise to the cilium .

“ The concentration of Hedgehog makes the thumb of the right hand grow on the left hand side and the thumb of the left hand grow on the right hand side .
” Thus , scientists define Hedgehog as a morphogen – a signal that is concentration - dependent and controls the pattern formation of an organism .
A mutation in this signaling pathway induces dramatic and embryonically lethal malformations in the early developmental stage such as the formation of just one central eye .
Defects in the Hedgehog signaling pathway in humans are a cause for one of the most common birth defects – holoprosencephaly .
“ Hedgehog genes are not new in evolution and the signaling pathway functions in the fly , mouse , fish and in humans similarly ” , says Pia Aanstad .
In her research work she focuses on the zebra danio or zebra fish .
Due to the short developmental cycle , the scientists are able to observe the development of the small tropic fish in fast motion .
“ We want to better understand how the cells process the signals of the signaling molecules and how they react .
” During her time as a post doc in San Francisco , U.S. , Pia Aanstad discovered a mutated zebra fish whose Hedgehog signaling pathway was disrupted .
The fish showed a genetic alteration at the so - called Smoothened ( Smo ) protein , which is located at the cell membrane and transfers the Hedgehog signal into the cell .
In 2005 , Aanstad and her colleagues published a paper in the renowned journal Nature , in which they showed that Smo is concentrated at cilia ( cellular projections ) and also functions at the cilium .
“ By using high - resolution fluorescence microscopy , we have now shown that in the new mutants a small genetic alteration at the extracellular part of this protein inhibits localization in the cilia and that while the cells identify the Hedgehog signals , they interpret the concentration incorrectly ” , explains Pia Aanstad .
“ This is evidence for the notion that cells use various molecular mechanisms for interpreting different Hedgehog concentrations .
” This fact may also be of importance for the diagnosis and treatment of certain cancers ( basal cell carcinoma ) , where the constant up - regulation of the Hedgehog signal is responsible for uncontrolled cell growth .
Aanstad published the findings together with her colleagues from the University of California , San Francisco in the journal Current Biology .
Pia Aanstad started her research work at the Institute for Molecular Biology of the University of Innsbruck , headed by Prof. Dirk Meyer , last year .
The Norwegian studied in England and continued her education at the Max - Planck Institute for Molecular Genetics in Berlin and at the Department of Biochemistry of the University of California .
Together with her own research group in Innsbruck , she continues her research work on the Hedgehog signaling pathway .
Because the question of which other mechanisms the cells use to interpret the concentration of signaling proteins has not been answered so far .

私はとっても文系なので日本語処理をしたくてしたくて仕方ないのは当然のことです。しかし日本語の処理ということを考えますと、文系の一般的な感覚としましてはこれまでやはり実績とノウハウの蓄積から、Perlが用いられることが多かったのではないでしょうか（いや、でも今となっては、もうそうでもない？私の頭が古いだけ？）。実際のところ私もPerlを使ってきたわけなのですが、最近めっきりPerlを実用しなくなってしまいましたので、日本語の処理もやはり手慣れたRubyでやっつけたくなるわけです。これまでもRubyで日本語処理はしてきたわけですが、1.9ならこれまで以上にとっても簡単だよ！ということを先日以下の記事を書いていて感じましたので、これを簡単にまとめておきたいと思います。
ところで 、Perlは私にプログラミングに必要なほとんどの知識を授けてくれた、とても恩義ある言語です。オブジェクト指向を学んだのもRubyからではなくPerlからでした。日本語処理をしたいだけなら、現在のところPerlの方がはるかに便利だと思います。この観点において敢えてRubyを使うメリットは正直ないと思いますが、でもRubyが好きな人は参考にしてみて下さい。
てな前置きなので、文系の人にとっても優しく書いていきたいと思います。だからここで説明するのは、基本的な操作だけどこれが分からないとどうにも始まらないだろう次の三つだけです。

日本語に対する正規表現
ファイルを読み込む 何かテキストなどを読み込んでそれを対象として処理したいと考えた場合、文字のエンコーディングについて注意しておく必要があります。色々種類があって良く分からないよね、面倒だよね、と思うわけですが、まぁ大体のところSJISかEUCかUTF-8のいずれかを扱う場合がほとんどではないでしょうか。なお、スクリプト自体はUTF-8で書くことを想定しています、最初のマジックコメント" #

一文字ずつ処理す る 1.8で は$ KCODEを設定して云々してきたわけですが、1.9からはマジックコメントもしくは

日本語に対する正規表現 文字クラスがとっても便利です。でも文 字Propertyを使う時には正規表現リテラルのしっぽに" u"を忘れないでね！忘れるとエラーになりますよ（正確に言うと/\p{Katakana}/だと u が必須で /あ\p{Katakana} / なら u を付けなくても大丈夫。ちょっと混乱しそうだから、いっつも u をつけておけば解決？）。 " あいうえお一二三々 " .each_char do | char | print char if / \p { Hiragana} /u =~ char end " あいうえお一二三々 " .each_char do | char | print char if / \p {Han} /u =~ char end " あいうえお一二三々 " .each_char do | char | print char if /[ \u4E00 - \u9 FFF

Advertisement Iran says it has successfully test launched a mid-range surface - to - surface missile , state media have reported .
President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad said the Sajjil - 2 missile used " advanced technology " and had landed on target .
He was speaking in Semnan , from where the missile , with a range of 2,000 km ( 1,240 miles ) , was reportedly launched .
The US confirmed the launch had taken place , and reiterated that President Barack Obama was " concerned " about Iran 's missile development .
Analysts say the test may be seen as provocative by Iran 's Arab neighbours and its opponents in the West .
" The defence minister [ Mohammed Najjar ] told me today that we launched a Sajjil - 2 missile , which is a two - stage missile and it has reached the intended target , " Mr Ahmadinejad told a crowd in the northern town .
He said the missile used solid fuel and was " able to go beyond the atmosphere then come back and hit its target " .
Solid - fuel missiles are reputedly more accurate than liquid - fuel missiles , which make up the majority of Iran 's long - range arsenal .
Defense Secretary Robert Gates confirmed that a " successful flight test " had taken place , but said it was not clear if the missile had reached its intended target .
President Obama had well - known concerns about Iran 's missile development programme , said White House spokesman Robert Gibbs .
He also had " the strong belief that the pursuit of these programmes does not strengthen the security of Iran but instead make them less safe " .
Meanwhile , a spokesman for the Pentagon said Iran was at a crossroads , and must choose between " continued destabilisation in the region " or pursuing " more normalised " relations with its neighbours and the US .
Political message Iran tested a Sajjil missile in November last year , described by officials at the time as a highly accurate " defensive " weapon .
Mr Ahmadinejad and three others have been cleared to run for office The BBC's Jon Leyne in Tehran says the Sajjil - 2 is one of Iran 's longest range rockets , able to reach Israel and US bases in the Gulf , and the launch is likely to be criticised by the West .
It is hard to tell whether the launch was deliberately provocative , but the fact that it was announced by the president means it is probably intended as a political message , says our correspondent .
Following the announcement , Italy 's foreign minister cancelled a planned trip to Tehran because Iranian officials changed the venue for his two - day visit .
Foreign Minister Franco Frattini rejected the request to meet Mr Ahmadinejad at the launch site , Semnan , instead of in the capital .
Hours before his trip should have begun , Mr Frattini expressed " strong regret over a lost opportunity " to discuss Iran 's role in stabilising Pakistan and Afghanistan .
Iran says its missile development programme is solely for defensive and scientific purposes , but critics say the rockets could one day be used to deliver nuclear warheads , although Iran denies its nuclear programme has any military dimension .
The announcement of the launch came shortly after Mahmoud Ahmadinejad was confirmed as one of the four candidates cleared to stand in Iran 's 12 June presidential elections .
He will run against two leading reformists - former Prime Minister Mir-Hossein Mousavi and ex-parliament speaker Mehdi Karoubi - and Mohsen Rezai , former chief of the Revolutionary Guards .

DETROIT , Michigan ( CNN ) -- Renea Mitchell said her son Robert wanted " nothing to do " with police , a feeling she said is " nothing new " among teenagers in Detroit .
Renea Mitchell mourns over the body of her son , Robert , at his funeral .
But she wants to know why police felt they needed to use a Taser on a scared , 16 - year - old , learning - disabled boy with no criminal record .
Robert Mitchell died April 10 in an abandoned house in Warren , just across Eight Mile Road from Detroit proper .
His death led to a lawsuit and a protest last week by about 100 people on the thoroughfare , which separates Detroit from its northern suburbs .
Police said the teen was resisting arrest after bolting from his cousin's car during a traffic stop , and the use of the Taser was justified .
But Renea Mitchell calls her son's death " murder . "
" They are here to protect us .
There 's no reason for what they 've done , " she said .
" There 's no reason , no excuse . "
Warren police had pulled over Mitchell 's cousin , Chris Davis , for having an expired license plate when Mitchell " jumped out and started running , " Davis said .
" I told him not to , but he was real scared , " Davis told CNN .
" He was petrified .
He hopped out the car and started running . "
Police followed Mitchell into an abandoned house about two blocks away .
Officers tried to apprehend him once he was inside , but he resisted , Warren Police Commissioner William Dwyer told CNN .
" They ordered him several times not to resist , and he continued to resist , " Dwyer said .
" They had no alternative to use what they felt at the time was non-lethal force . "
The commissioner called Mitchell 's death " a tragedy , " but said police who watch someone run from them " can only assume he committed a crime or is wanted for a crime . "
The officers had been trained to use Tasers on people resisting arrest , " so there was nothing wrong with using that Taser , " Dwyer said .
The 5 - foot - 2 , 110 - pound Mitchell died after being shot once with a Taser , which delivers a 50,000 - volt electric charge .
The Macomb County medical examiner 's office says an autopsy report has not yet been completed .
The Warren Police Department 's internal affairs office ruled the use of the Taser was justified , and the officers involved in his death are back on the job .
But Mitchell 's family is suing the department and the city , arguing there was " no articulable reason " to use the Taser on him .
Police consider the Taser a non-lethal weapon , and Dwyer said it has been " a very useful tool . "
But the human rights group Amnesty International has documented more than 350 cases in which people have died after being shocked with Tasers .
Mitchell 's death was at least the third involving people shot with Tasers in 2009 , and the second in Michigan .
A 15 - year - old in Bay City , about 115 miles north of Detroit , died in March ; a Virginia teen died in January .
Other high - profile cases have raised questions about the use of the devices .
In October 2007 , a Polish immigrant who spoke no English was Tasered and died after a scuffle with police at the airport in Vancouver , British Columbia .
In January 2008 , a man died after being shocked nine times with one of the devices during his arrest on a cocaine possession charge .
The Winnfield , Louisiana , police officer who arrested him was fired and indicted on manslaughter charges .
He has pleaded not guilty and faces trial in July .
While police defend the use of the devices , Warren Mayor James Fouts has called for a review of how they should be used .
" Obviously we have a legal situation , so I 'm not able to give too strong opinion either way , " Fouts told CNN .
But he added , " We need to re-evaulate and look very closely at what it is that we 're currently doing . "
But Renea Mitchell said she wants to see the police face a courtroom over her son's death .
" When you 're living in this world , people die every day , " his mother said .
" God is my father , and I trust that Robert is safe .
Robert is safe , I have no doubt in my mind .
I just want justice now . "

Olympus
Mons is the latest hotspot in the hunt for habitable zones on Mars .
The Martian volcano is about three times the height of Mount Everest , but it ’s the small details that matter to Rice University professors Patrick McGovern and Julia Morgan .
After studying computer models of Olympus Mons ’ formation , McGovern and Morgan are proposing that pockets of ancient water could still be trapped under the mountain .
Their research is published in February ’s issue of the journal Geology .
Olympus
Mons is tall , standing almost 15 miles ( 24 km ) high , and slopes gently from the foothills to the caldera , a distance of more than 150 miles ( 241 km ) .
That shallow slope is a clue to what lies beneath , say the researchers .
They suspect if they were able to stand on the northwest side of Olympus Mons and start digging , they ’d eventually find clay sediment deposited there billions of years ago , before the mountain was even a molehill .
In modeling the formation of Olympus Mons with an algorithm known as particle dynamics simulation , McGovern and Morgan determined that only the presence of ancient clay sediments can account for the volcano ’s asymmetric shape .
The presence of sediment indicates water was or is involved .
The European Space Agency ’s Mars Express spacecraft has in recent years found abundant evidence of clay on Mars .
This supports a previous theory that where Olympus Mons now stands , a layer of sediment once rested that may have been hundreds of meters thick .
Morgan and McGovern show in their computer models that volcanic material was able to spread to Olympus - sized proportions because of the clay ’s friction - reducing effect , a phenomenon also seen at volcanoes in Hawaii .
But fluids embedded in an impermeable , pressurized layer of clay sediment would allow the kind of slipping motion that would account for Olympus Mons ’ spread - out northeast flank – and they may still be there .
And because NASA ’s Phoenix lander found ice underneath the Martian surface last year , Morgan and McGovern believe it ’s reasonable to suspect water could be trapped in the sediment underneath the mountain .
“ This deep reservoir , warmed by geothermal gradients and magmatic heat and protected from adverse surface conditions , would be a favored environment for the development and maintenance of thermophilic organisms , ” they wrote .
On Earth , such primal life forms exist along deep geothermal vents on the ocean floor .
Finding a source of heat will be a challenge , Morgan and McGovern admit .
“ We ’d love to have the answer to that question , ” said McGovern .
He noted that evidence of methane on Mars is considered by some to be another marker for life .

NEW YORK ( CNNMoney.com ) -- General Motors Corp. has struck a deal to sell its Hummer truck unit to a Chinese industrial business , the two companies confirmed Tuesday .
Privately owned Sichuan Tengzhong Heavy Industrial Machinery Company Ltd. , based in China , will acquire the truck brand , which has been part of GM since 1999 .
Tengzhong said it plans to keep Hummer 's management team .
" We plan to ... allow Humer to innovate and grow in exciting new ways under the leadership and continuity of its current management team , " said Yang Yi , chief executive of Tengzhong .
Yang said the deal " will allow Hummer to better meet demand for new products such as more fuel - efficient vehicles in the U.S. "
The companies said the deal would likely close by the end of September .
As part of the deal , some GM plants will continue to build the Hummer brand for the new owner , at least for awhile .
The company said its Shreveport , La. , plant will keep building Hummers for the new owner until at least 2010 .
The news comes a day after GM ( GMGMQ ) filed for bankruptcy protection in New York .
" I 'm confident that Hummer will thrive globally under its new ownership , " said Troy Clarke , president of GM North America , in a press release .
" And for GM , this sale continues to accelerate the reinvention of GM into a leaner , more focused , and more cost - competitive automaker . "
GM also said that the deal should protect more than 3,000 jobs in manufacturing and engineering , and at dealerships " around the country . "
The sale of the Hummer brand to a Chinese company will not impact the production of U.S. military vehicles .
Military Humvees are produced by a different company , privately held AM General , based in South Bend , Ind .
The Hummer and other large vehicles have been a drag on the U.S. auto industry since fuel prices spiked in 2008 and the recession deepened .
GM said it sold 5,013 Hummers worldwide in the first quarter , down 62 % from the 13,050 that it sold in the same period the prior year .
Hummer is n't the only brand that GM is leaving behind .
The automaker will also shed its Pontiac , Saturn and Saab brands and cut loose more than 2,000 of its 6,000 U.S. dealerships by next year .
That could result in more than 100,000 additional job losses if those dealerships are forced to close .
GM filed for bankruptcy hours after Chrysler 's bankruptcy process cleared a hurdle when a federal judge approved its asset sale .
The GM bankruptcy was hailed by President Obama , who wants a complete overhaul of the U.S. auto industry , even though the Chapter 11 filing is expected to result in the loss of 20,000 jobs and the closure of a dozen facilities .
Citigroup ( C , Fortune 500 ) was financial adviser in GM's Hummer deal .

As the world gears up once again for a flu pandemic that may or may not arrive ( it actually seems possible this time ) , we might want to remember some of the lessons of the last flu scare .
One of these is that there are winners as well as losers in every high - profile outbreak of infectious disease .
First and foremost among them , of course , is Big Pharma , which can always be counted on to have its hand out wherever human misery presents an opportunity to rake in some cash .
In 2005 , I reported on the bird flu scare for the Village Voice in a piece called “ Capitalizing on the Flu . ”
We can realistically hope that our current federal government will improve upon the bungled effort made by the Bush Administration to prepare for the onslaught of avian flu — which fortunately did n’t materialize .
But certain aspects of the crisis are likely to be repeated , and profiteers will surely waste no time in gathering at the trough .
Then , as now , one of the two effective antidotes was a drug called Tamiflu .
But this silver bullet came with side effects , as well as a high price tag .
As I reported in 2005 :
With no vaccine in sight , the U.S. government , along with others , is belatedly stocking up on Tamiflu , a drug that supposedly offers some defense against bird flu .
But last week Japanese newspapers told how children who were administered Tamiflu went mad and tried to kill themselves by jumping out of windows .
In a cautionary statement the FDA noted 12 deaths among children , and said there are reports of psychiatric disturbances , including hallucinations , along with heart and lung disorders .
Roche , the manufacturer , is quoted by the BBC as stating that the rate of deaths and psychiatric problems is no higher among those taking its medication than among those with flu .
The company is increasing Tamiflu production to 300 million doses a year to meet demand .
There are other reasons people are leery of Tamiflu .
Given the rip - offs in Iraq and after the hurricanes , people are understandably interested in knowing just who is going to get rich off the plague .
Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld , himself former CEO of drug company Searle , currently owns stock in the one company that owns Tamiflu patents — to the tune of at least $ 18 million .
Rumsfeld says he understands why people might question his holdings , but selling them would raise even more questions .
So he is hanging on to what he ’s got .
A report by Citicorp at the time described which pharmaceutical manufacturers and other comapnies stood to make money :
Winners could include drug makers such as Gilead Sciences , Roche , GlaxoSmithKline , and Sanofi -Aventis .
Other possible winners are hospital chains such as Rhoen Klinikum , cleaning - products makers such as Henkel , Ecolab , and Clorox , as well as home entertainment companies such as Blockbuster and Nintendo… .
In order for the pharmaceutical companies to profit from making flu vaccine in the administration ’s $ 7.1 billion pandemic flu plan , Bush now is proposing to ban liability suits against them except in cases of willful misconduct .
As for those injured by a flu vaccine , possible lawsuits remain an open question … .
With a worldwide market estimated at more than $ 1 billion , there ’s big money in a flu plague .
Kimberly - Clark ’s Chinese subsidiary is already ramping up manufacture of new lines of medical masks , wipes , and hand - washing liquids , according to Business Week , with consulting firms Kroll and Booz Allen Hamilton selling flu preparedness advice to companies and governments .
“ Crisis is an opportunity as long as you see it first , ” Pitney Bowes ’s Christian Crews tells the magazine .
Of course , that was then , and this is now .
In the coming days we ’re bound to discover who ’s pulling in the pork this time .
But even before the U.S. markets open this morning , early indications are n’t hard to find : “ Fears of a potential pandemic are bringing down stock markets around the world today , ” public radio’s “ Marketplace ” reports from London , ” but two big pharmaceutical companies are getting a boost from the news ” :
The hardest part of using Linux is often installing it .
Over the last couple of years , Linux has come a long way in terms of hardware support , and these days it is relatively rare that an installation of ubuntu / fedora will be lacking any drivers for your machine .
However , installing any OS can still sometimes be a tedious task and one that scares the wits out of the average computer user .
And , for the expert users out there , it ’s just more fun to buy a computer with Linux already on it and not have to pay the Microsoft tax – even , if you are going to put your favorite distro on it anyway .
You can find Linux servers sold all sort of places , but where can you find Linux desktops for sale ?
Here is a list of places I have had good experiences with or have had heard good things about directly :
Dell http://www.dell.com/ubuntu
I bought a laptop ( 1420 ) from dell with ubuntu preinstalled .
It showed up and all of the hardware immediately worked flawlessly : webcam , wifi , suspend / resume , audio , compiz etc …
The good thing about buying a dellbuntu , as opposed to a computer from Best Buy , is you can be absolutely sure that everything will be supported .
Beyond piece of mind , buying an ubuntu machine from Dell sends a message to the big manufactures that there is a demand for Linux and Linux support on their computers .
ZaReason http://www.zareason.com
ZaReason is a local Berkeley company that sells preinstalled Ubuntu desktops and laptops all over the world .
They also sell Ubuntu swag such as case badges to replace any “ powered by windows ” stickers on your old computers ( of which I have bought to give away at our meetings ) .
The prices start low and the computers are available with many customizations .
Whenever you buy a machine from ZaReason , they include a screwdriver in your package , letting you know that you are free to tinker with your computer .
If you want a preinstalled Ubuntu computer with great Linux support and would rather promote a small Linux only dealer than a big corporation like Dell , consider ZaReason .
I intend to buy my next computer from them .
System76 http://www.system76.com
Like ZaReason , System76 , sells preinstalled Ubuntu Laptops / Desktops ( and now they have their very own netbook ) .
They were one of the first companies to sell their own Linux systems and have a large user and support community ( including their own forum at ubuntuforums ) .
Hardware support is flawless and they have a wide array of machines designed for everyday users , to business laptops to servers .
I have never had experience with a System76 machine , but have heard nothing but good things .
EmperorLinux http://www.emperorlinux.com
Unlike System76 and ZaReason , EmperorLinux does not create their own computers .
They get high - end computers from Dell / Lenovo ( including several tablet options ) and install Linux on them for you .
These are great for power users who want a high end ( or business ) machine with Linux on it .
But , it does not have the advantage of being a true Linux computer from start to finish .
LinuxCertified http://www.linuxcertified.com/linux_laptops.html
Linux certified also sells some preinstalled Linux laptops / desktops .
I know very little about these machines , but they are worth looking into before you decide on a purchase .
Netbooks
Since the EeePC , a lot of netbooks have flooded the market , most with a Linux option .
I own and love the EeePC 901 .
It originally came with a somewhat lame Linux distro based on Xandros .
However , I have installed Ubuntu Netbook Remix on it , and it is a great little Linux laptop .
Here are EeePC Linux options available at Amazon .

HP SUSE Probook
Finally , it looks like HP is getting back into the game …

For this year ’s Aspen Design Challenge — which had the theme Designing Water ’s Future — Umea Institute of Design student Ceren Bagatar proposed the following concept : a Rescue Bottle .
photo by MNgilen
The bottle is designed to address not only the scarcity of fresh water the world is facing , but mostly the contaminated and hazardous water conditions due to flooding , hurricanes and tsunamis .
Those disasters expose and contaminate surface water , ground water and drinking water supplies with a variety of elements : toxins , chemicals , septic and animal carcasses .
The Rescue Bottle filters contaminated water through a reverse osmosis membrane using the driving force of highly concentrated dioralyte solution .
The bottle has a 500 ml capacity and has an interchangable mouthpiece for multi-user usage .
The dioralyte solution supports 15 batches of drinking water .
Awesome concept , Ceren !

Steven Frank ’s essay on the current state of the desktop UI reminded me of Oberon , a delightfully insane system I used back when I was studying computer science at ETH Zürich .
The first thing you have to understand about Oberon is that it evolved entirely outside of the normal genealogy of user interfaces .
Extremely simplified , the evolution of modern graphical user interfaces goes something like this :
The Lisa marked the first modern user interface with windows , icons as objects , menus and mouse input .
To this day , these concepts remain essentially unchanged .
A person used to Vista or Mac OS X would immediately understand how the Lisa works .
Oberon is not part of the « Lisa » line of user interfaces .
The following part is based on what people at ETH Zürich have told me and may or may not be true .
When ETH Zürich started its own computer science program in the 60s , buying computers from the US turned out to be a bit of an issue .
They were expensive and often unsuitable for European use ( what with our strange umlauts and stubborn insistence on speaking languages different from English ) .
So ETH Zürich decided to start working on its own hardware and software systems .
These projects were based on the Alto Niklaus Wirth had seen at Xerox PARC .
In the early 80s , the strangely named Lilith Workstation was one of the world ’s first high - resolution computers with a graphical user interface .
The software system developed for the Lilith was Modula - 2 and later Oberon , which is both a programming language and an OS with a unique text - based graphical user interface .
Basically , Oberon ignored all that Lisa stuff and progressed from an entirely different branch of the GUI genealogy :
In some ways , the result is closer to the Canon Cat than to any other modern system .
Obviously , Oberon has evolved a lot of weird features that are not found in any of the « Lisa - based » GUIs .
Here are two of them .
Everything is a Command Line
Even though Oberon is a graphical , mouse - driven user interface , it is also very much text - based .
It eschews icons in favour of words :
To launch applications or execute commands , you first type them somewhere ( anywhere , it does n’t matter ) , and then middle - click them :
This may seem weird at first , but is actually extremely cool because it allows for some neat features .
You need a program launcher ?
Create a new text file with the programs you need .
Want to write a tutorial on a topic ?
You can include all kinds of commands right inside the tutorial and simply tell readers to click on them .
Need to explain to your aunt what application to launch ?
Tell her to click on a word in the e-mail you just sent her .
Working on something specific which requires you to execute the same commands again and again ( such as compiling and executing an application ) ?
Simply type the commands somewhere and you ’ve essentially created your own ad - hoc user interface for your current task .
Everything is Zoomable
Oberon ’s « desktop » is an infinitely large two - dimensional space on which windows ( and documents , since the distinction becomes meaningless in some ways ) can be arranged :
( Click for a larger version )
It ’s incredibly easy to move around on this plane and zoom in and out of it .
Instead of stacking windows , hiding them behind each other ( which is possible in modern versions of Oberon ) , you simply arrange them next to each other and zoom out and in again to switch between them .
When people held presentations using Oberon , they would arrange all slides next to each other , zoom in on the first one , and then simply slide the view one screen size to the right to go to the next slide .
This essentially obsoletes concepts like virtual desktops , application switchers , or Exposé , since you have as much space as you need on your one desktop , and since you do n’t need to rearrange windows in order to get an overview of your open stuff .
It ’s especially cool on netbooks with tiny screens .
In some ways , this also obsoletes the idea of opening a document .
Essentially , all documents can be open all the time .
All you have to do to interact with one is to zoom in close enough .
A document can be its own icon , and its own window .
There ’s a movie on YouTube showing how zooming in Oberon works .
Sounds cool , can I play around with this stuff ?
Sure .
In fact , I recommend it .
It ’s most likely unlike everything else you ’ve ever seen .
You can get a recent version of Oberon on bluebottle .ethz.ch or from the Oberon Community Platform .
I ’m not entirely sure which versions contain which features .
The version I ’ve played around with most recently is the one found at bluebottle .ethz.ch ; it contains the zoomable UI , which not all versions of Oberon have .
I could n’t get it to run on VMware , but it runs just fine in Parallels .
To get started , click on « Docu » and « Tutorial » after you ’ve launched Oberon .
If you have a mouse with less than three buttons , try holding down modifiers while clicking and using the scroll wheel .
So , did you actually use this thing ?
Yeah .
Oberon is very much in active use at ETH Zürich .
We used it as one of our main operating systems .
Update
You can find more current versions of A2 here .

This morning I got an email from reader SD about a recent experience with the credit reporting industry :
Through some screwups and misunderstandings settling my father ’s estate , we were hit with a tax lien .
We immediately cleared it up , but a year or so later when I went to get a car loan there it was on the record .
Got a notarized proof of clearance on it , sent it to the credit reporting agency .
A few years after that , we got a home improvement loan and there it was .
My wife was visiting our daughter recently in San Diego and looking at houses and a realtor ran a credit report and there it was .
It appears that when any credit reporting agency gets some dirt on you , they immediately tell all the peer operations …. who tell all that they work with , and on and on .
Not only that , but it ’s nearly impossible to ferret out every instance of such misinformation ( which should be the credit reporting agency ’s responsibility to clean up ) , AND the chain reaction keeps going until the same piece of disinformation that you originally expunged from , say , Experian , comes BACK to them and they enter it their database against you AGAIN .
Financial organizations should not only be made liable / responsible for correcting this kind of thing , but should be responsible for making sure that all instances of it are expunged .
As it is , they love and live for dirt on you , and take no responsibility for its correctness or the integrity of their data .
And you never find out , all the while suffering under the bad credit score unknowingly until you formally take out some kind of loan … .
Eso es una banqueta con ruedas , no sirve para lo que lo queres usar , encima es alta , es para oficinas donde te atienden en un mostrador , por eso es un poco mas alta y tiene esa barra circular para apoyar los pies , ojo que te clavas y no te va a servir , es muy incomoda , una silla blanca de plastico de jardin te va a ir mejor que eso , 15 minutos sentado en eso y te vas a querer cortar las pelotas por gastar al pedo , si no te alcanza la guita para comprar lo que necesitas y para el uso que le queres dar mejor arreglate con lo que tengas en tu casa .
The American Clean Energy and Security Act , ACES , H.R. 2454 , previously known as the Waxman - Markey climate and energy bill , was recently passed by the US House of Representatives on 26 June 2009 .
The key elements of the bill are presented below .
Sponsors
The Bill is authored by the House Energy & Commerce Committee and is sponsored by the Committee ’s Chairman , Congressmen , Henry Waxman ( D - California ) and by the Chairman of the Environment & Energy Sub- committee , Ed Markey ( D - Massachusetts ) .
Progress to Date
The Bill was drafted by the House Energy and Commerce Committee .
It was released in a draft form in March 2009 and was subsequently amended .
It passed the House Energy and Commerce Committee on 21 May 2009 .
The bill was subsequently sent before eight other congressional committees that have responsibilities relating to the content of the bill .
The most important of these committees were the Natural Resources Committee , the Ways and Means Committee and the Committee on Agriculture .
These Committees reviewed and endorsed the bill .
On 26 June , the Bill was sent to the US House of Representatives , where it was passed by a vote of 219 to 212 .
Next Steps
After the summer recess , the bill will be sent to the Senate , which has drafted a comparable bill on energy and climate change .
The Senate bill , called the American Clean Energy Leadership Act ( ACELA ) , is a bipartisan bill , authored by the Senate Committee on Energy & Natural Resources under the chairmanship of Senator Jeff Bingaman ( D - New Mexico ) .
This bill passed the Senate Energy & Natural Resources Committee on 17 June 2009 .
In addition , the Senate ’s Environment and Public Works Committee , chaired by Senator Barbara Boxer ( D - California ) has been charged with developing provisions for a cap - and - trade scheme that will be incorporated into the ACELA .
The Senate Majority Leader , Harry Reid ( D - Nevada ) has requested that these provisions , as well as all Committee mark - ups of the ACELA , be completed by 28 September .
In all likelihood , for the Waxman - Markey Bill to pass the Senate , it will need to be ‘ reconciled ’ with the Senate ’s ACELA , which will mean further changes and compromises .
If this can be achieved , the joint legislation will be sent to both chambers for a final vote , before being sent to the President for signing into law .
Overview of the Bill
The bill comprises five titles .
Title I – Clean Energy : would set standards for conventional and renewable energy technologies and provide funds to support the development of clean energy projects and technologies .
Title II – Energy Efficiency : would mandate new energy efficiency standards for appliances , buildings , transport and industry and provide funds to support energy efficiency projects and technologies .
Title III – Reducing Global Warming Pollution : would create a national cap - and - trade scheme that would reduce GHG emissions from major sources by 17 percent by 2020 and 83 percent by 2050 relative to 2005 levels .
Title IV – Transitioning to a Clean Energy Economy : would provide financial assistance to those industries and persons affected by the Bill ’s provisions and protect consumers from increases in energy prices .
Title V – Offsets from Domestic Forestry & Agriculture : would provide opportunities for domestic emissions from the forestry and agricultural sectors .
The Key Elements of the Bill
Clean Energy
Renewable electricity standard
The bill would create a nationwide renewable electricity standard ( RES ) .
States would be required to produce 6 percent of total electricity from renewable sources by 2012 and 20 percent by 2020 .
Up to 5 % of the RES may be met with energy efficiency measures in place of renewables , rising to 8 percent under certain circumstances .
Eligible renewable sources are defined as wind , solar , geothermal , renewable biomass , biogas derived exclusively from renewable biomass , biofuels derived exclusively from renewable biomass , qualified hydropower commissioned after 1992 , and marine and hydrokinetic sources .
Performance Standards for New Coal - Fired Power Plants & Carbon Capture and Sequestration
The bill would require coal - fired electricity generators to meet strict emission performance standards .
These standards would effectively make the implementation of CCS technology mandatory at new coal - fired power stations .
New coal - fired power stations that implement CCS technologies would be eligible to receive federal financial assistance in the form of freely allocated emission allowances , under certain conditions .
Coal - fired plant permitted between 2009 and 2015 Must achieve a 50 percent reduction in emissions by 2025 .
Would be eligible for federal financial assistance if CCS is implemented within 5 years of commencement of operations .
Coal - fired plant permitted between 2015 and 2020 Must achieve a 50 percent reduction in emissions by 2025 .
Would be eligible for federal financial assistance if CCS is implemented upon commencement of operations .
Coal - fired plant permitted after 2020 Must achieve a 65 percent reduction in emissions upon commencement of operations .
The 2025 deadline may be brought forward in the event that more than 4GW of CCS is installed before this date , or it may be extended by up to 18 months on a case by case basis , at the discretion of the EPA .
Funds of US $ 1 billion per year would be made available for CCS demonstration and deployment – the proceeds to come from a levy or ‘ wire charge ’ on electricity produced from fossil fuels .
Investments in Clean Energy Technologies
The bill would direct an estimated US $ 190 billion through 2025 towards a range of clean energy technologies , including :
$ 90 billion to renewable - energy and energy - efficiency programmes ;
$ 60 billion to carbon capture and sequestration technologies ;
$ 20 billion to electric and other advanced vehicles technologies ; and
$ 20 billion for basic research and development .
The bill would also create the Clean Energy Deployment Administration within the federal government to support private investments in clean energy technologies , including nuclear power .
Modernizing the Electricity Grid .
The bill also includes provisions to develop smart grid technologies and to improve the national transmission grid in order to accommodate the growth in renewable electricity sources .
Energy Efficiency
Energy Efficiency Standards for New Buildings
The bill would require State governments to update building codes , which would require new buildings to be 30 percent more energy efficiency by 2012 and 50 percent more efficient by 2016 .
Energy Efficiency Standards for Lighting & Appliances
The bill would mandate new efficiency standards for lighting products , commercial furnaces , and other appliances .
Fuel Standards for Heavy Vehicles
The bill would require the EPA to introduce fuel efficiency standards for heave and off - road vehicles .
National Cap-and - Trade Scheme
The bill would create a national cap - and - trade scheme covering 85 percent of US emissions with the long - term goal of delivering an 80 percent reduction in GHG emissions relative to 2005 levels by 2050 .
Coverage
Emissions caps would be placed electricity generators , oil refiners , natural gas suppliers , and energy intensive industries such as iron and steel , cement and paper .
The caps would cover approximately 85 percent of US GHG emissions by 2016 .
Emissions Caps
The proposed scheme would commence in 2012 .
Emissions caps would be defined relative to 2005 levels and would rise from a 3 % reduction by 2012 , to 17 percent by 2020 , 42 percent by 2030 and 83 percent by 2050 .
Allocation of Emission Allowances
At the start of the scheme , approximately 15 percent of emission allowances would be auctioned .
This percentage would increase gradually over time .
The revenue raised form auctions would be recycled to consumers through a combination of refundable tax credits and electronic benefit payments to minimize the impact of the scheme on low - and middle - income earners .
The bill sets a minimum auction price of US $ 10 in 2012 , rising at 5 percent plus inflation in subsequent years .
At the start of the scheme , approximately 85 percent of emission allowances would be allocated gratis .
Of those allowances , about one - fifth would be allocated to liable parties , in order to reduce the impact of the scheme on key sectors .
Party Free Allocation Liable Parties Energy intensive industries , such as iron and steel , cement and paper .
15 percent from 2014 , gradually reduced in line with emission reductions , then phased - out after 2025 .
Coal - fired electricity generators and other electricity generators under long term supply contracts .
5 percent through 2025 , then phased - out by 2030 .
Oil refineries .
2 percent through 2025 .
Electric utilities – CCS technology development 2 percent through 2017 , rising to 5 percent thereafter – to be used to cover the costs of CCS .
About two - thirds would be allocated to parties not covered by the scheme , in order to support the development of clean technologies and to reduce the impact of the scheme on low - and middle - income households .
Party Free Allocation Affected Parties Electricity distributors .
32 percent through 2025 , then phased - out by 2030
The proceeds to be used to offset increases in retail electricity prices arising from the scheme .
State governments .
10 percent through 2015 , then declining gradually to 5 percent by 2022 .
1.6 percent through 2025 .
The proceeds to be used to fund renewable energy , energy efficiency , clean transport and transmission infrastructure projects .
The proceeds to be used to offset increases in home heating oil .
Natural gas distributors .
9 percent through 2025 , then phased - out by 2030 .
The proceeds to be used to offset increases in retail energy prices arising from the scheme and to fund energy - efficiency projects .
Vehicle manufacturers .
3 percent through 2017 , then 1 percent through 2025 .
The proceeds to be used to fund the development of clean vehicle technologies .
And about ten percent of allowances would be allocated to help support the transition to a clean economy , adaptation and international technology transfer .
Party Free Allocation Domestic Adaptation 2 percent through 2012 , then 4 percent through 2026 , then 8 percent thereafter .
The proceeds to be used to fund domestic adaptation .
Preventing Tropical Deforestation 5 percent through 2025 , then 3 percent through to 2030 , then 2 percent thereafter .
The proceeds to be used to prevent tropical deforestation and build capacity in this area .
International Adaptation 2 percent through 2021 , then 4 percent through to 2026 , then 8 percent thereafter .
The proceeds to be used for international adaptation and clean technology transfer .
Worker Training 0.5 % through 2021 , then 1 percent thereafter .
The proceeds to be used for worker assistance and job training .
Preliminary modelling by the EPA estimate that allowances will be worth between US $ 11 to US $ 15 in 2012 and US $ 22 to US $ 28 in 2025 .
The total value of all allowances would be US $ 60 billion in 2012 and US $ 113 billion in 2025 .
Cost - Containment Measures
The bill contains a number of provisions that are designed to provide flexibility and contain the costs of the scheme .
These include :
unlimited banking of allowances ;
a two - year compliance period ( which permits borrowing one year in advance ) ;
the right to borrow up to 15 % of allowances from years 2 to 5 beyond the current year , but subject to payment of 8 % interest ;
a strategic reserve of allowances that are available for auction if allowance prices exceed 160 % of their three - year average .
a minimum price of US $ 28 in 2012 for allowances auctioned under the strategic reserve provisions , thereafter rising at 5 % plus the rate of inflation up to 2014 .
Thereafter , the minimum price will be 160 % of the three - year average price of traded allowances .
Emission Offsets
The bill would permit liable parties to use up to 2 billion emission offsets to meet their obligations under the scheme in any given year .
Half of these offsets must be obtained from domestic sources and half from international sources .
In the event that insufficient domestic emission offsets are available , the portion of international offsets may be increased from 50 percent to 75 percent of the total .
The EPA will determine the eligibility of offset projects on the advice of the Offsets Integrity Advisory Panel , which would be established under the Bill .
The US Department of Agriculture ( USDA ) will oversee the offsets from domestic forestry and agricultural sources .
Penalties for non-compliance
The penalty for failure to comply with the emission cap will be a fine of two times the ‘ fair market value ’ of the missing allowances .
Interaction with pre-existing Trading Schemes
The bill would require that pre-existing state and regional emissions trading schemes be suspended over the period 2012 to 2017 .
Allowances issued under these schemes before 31 December 2011 , would be redeemed or exchanged for federal allowances .
Regulation of Trading
The bill sets out a framework for the regulation of trading in allowances and their derivatives .
The Federal Energy Regulatory Commissions will be charged with the regulation of the cash market in allowances and offsets ; while the Commodity Futures Trading Commission will have responsibility for the regulation and oversight of the derivatives market .
Notably , the bill would prohibit over - the - counter trading of derivatives .
Transition to a Clean Economy
Cost - Containment Measures
The bill also includes a number of additional measures intended to reduce the impacts of the bill on those persons likely to be the worst affected by the transition to a clean economy .
These measures include :
increased funding for the Energy Worker Training Program ;
entitlements for workers displaced as a result of the Bill ; and
college and university grants to prepare students for careers in the renewable energy and energy efficiency fields .
Trade Measures
The final version of the bill also introduces new trade provisions .
These provisions would requrie the President , from 2018 and in the absence of an ‘ equitable ’ international agreement , to introduce a system of international reserve allowances for imported goods .
These provisions would effectively extend the proposed cap - and - trade scheme to designated imports .
Under such a scheme , importers would have to acquire allowances before products covered by the scheme could be sold in the US .
The price for these international reserve allowances would be set daily so that it was ‘ equivalent ’ to the auction clearing price for domestic emission allowances .
In this sense , it is similar to an import permit program .
Provided that these provisions are applied equally to domestic and imported ‘ like products ’ they would be entirely consistent with WTO rules .
Nevertheless , the devil will be in the detail .
A great deal will rest upon how embodied CO2 can be included in the definition of ‘ like products ’ – this will raise a number of extremely complex issues relating to the calculation of embodied CO2 in a manner that is consistent between like products – each of which would conceivably be subject to challenge under WTO rules .
The President and the Congress may waive these provisions .
Costs of the Scheme
The Congressional Budget Office ( CBO ) estimates that the bill would increase government revenues by US $ 873 billion over the 2010 - 2019 period and would increase direct government spending by US $ 864 billion over that 10 - year period – creating a net revenue in the order of US$ 9 billion .
The CBO estimates that the bill will increase energy costs for an average American household by US $ 175 a year .

Apparently the fact that I use exceptions in my suggested control flow mechanism for collections makes me a bad person .
This idiocy touches on a sore point for me .
I have been invited to write a post on “ Why exceptions for control flow are a good idea ” .
So .
Here it is .
The thing is , I really ca n’t be bothered .
I can give and have given useful use cases , but I ’ll just be told that they ’re evil because I use exceptions .
So instead I will argue the converse :
Why they are not a bad idea .
Let ’s consider some common objections :
Exceptions are slow
No they ’re not .
Exceptions in C++ ( and I believe . NET ) may be slow , but many implementations of exceptions are in fact extremely fast .
The various ML implementations have taken advantage of this for quite some time .
The JVM too ( with some mild tricks ) has very fast exceptions .
Exceptions are for exceptional situations
This argument is pervasive .
It ’s also meaningless .
Depending on the intent of the one claiming it , it is one or more of three different forms of fallacy :
Assertion of the conclusion Argument by name .
They ’re called exceptions , therefore they must only be for exceptional conditions .
If I called them kittens would it suddenly be ok to use them for control flow ?
( Next post : Kittens for control flow considered harmful .
I look forward to seeing Josh Suereth ’s rebuttal ) .
Argument by meaningless blither .
What distinguishes “ exceptional conditions ” from “ control flow ” ?
I have reached the end of a million element list .
This happens one time in a million !
That sounds pretty exceptional to me !
Writing exception safe code is hard
No it ’s not .
Be sure to clean up anything that could need cleaning up in a finally block .
If you write decent code , and you ’re using a language with automatic memory management so that this does n’t apply to Joe Random Object , these tend to be small and relatively well isolated cases .
Where possible you abstract this out entirely by using patterns like automatic resource blocks ( remember :
In decent languages it ’s just a library ) .
Further , even if it were true , this would be an argument against using exceptions at all rather than using them for control flow :
If you are n’t sure where exceptions may be thrown from ( which is particularly true if you ’re writing generic library code ) , you have to write exception safe code .
It ’s confusing
Everything ’s confusing when you first encounter it .
Then you get used to it , you find where it does and does n’t work , and then it becomes non confusing .
As long as you continue to maintain that a technique is evil and should not be used it will remain confusing .
Debuggers will break on exceptions
Decent debuggers allow you to specify which exceptions you break on and which you do n’t .
It ’s easy to provide a marker class that says “ This exception is for control flow .
Do n’t worry about it ” .
You might accidentally catch the exceptions you ’re using for control flow with too broad exception handling
Consider the break / continue example .
What happens if I do the following ( and break is implemented with exceptions ) :
for ( thing <- my Things ) { try { doStuff ; if ( dieNow ) break ; } catch { case ( e : Exception ) => e.printStackTrace } }
We accidentally catch the break !
This is bad .
There are a couple aspects to my response to this :
First off , given sensible library design it does n’t happen at all .
Control flow exceptions get moved outside the hierarchy of normal exceptions which it ’s sensible to catch ( in my quick hacked together version they were Errors .
Really they should be subclasses of ControlFlow which extends Throwable ) .
Secondly , this is a problem with too broad exception handling :
You ’ve handled a generic exception where you probably just wanted to handle a specific one .
This is always known to be bad .
Thirdly , this is a really really easy problem to spot .
As soon as you even lightly test the code you will see a stack trace for Break being printed and will realise what you ’ve done wrong .
This might cost you a good 10 seconds of confusion tops .
( If you simply swallow the exception silently this is n’t true .
But if you do that I have no sympathy for you at all and your code deserves to break ) .
The problems with using exceptions for control flow are well documented
Actually , they ’re not .
If you do n’t believe me , check google scholar .
Edit :
It has been pointed out to me that if you add quotes to the search term then you do get a few hits .
They all seem to be random Java best practices documents deriving from Rules for developing robust programs with java exceptions , which does not appear to present any arguments not already covered here .
For completeness , here is the relevant section from it :
IM1 : Do not use exceptions for control flow .
It is possible to use the exception handling mechanism for control flow also during normal
program flow .
This makes the code harder to read , harder to analyze , significantly slower and
opens up for some horrible situations if an actual exception were to occur .
Exception should ,
as the name states , only be used in exceptional situations .
So we ’ve got one count of “ confusing ” , one count of “ performance ” , one of what I can only imagine is a vague allusion to the problem of accidentally catching the exception and a chaser of “ Exceptions should only be used in exceptional circumstances ” .
This , as far as I can tell , is the gold standard argument for the opposition in the Java realm .
Feel free to post additional arguments for or against in the comment .
I ’ll expand the article with any good ones posted .
Actresses
Ana de Armas is an actress from Cuba who first made her break into films in 2006 .
She was also a part of the Spanish television series El Internado and her most recent role lands her in Blade Runner : 2049 .
Prior to …
Wanted : a dog that can bark " Do n't do it Esther " .
You might recall that back in what convention demands we style as the glory days of That 's Life , the programme 's presenter , Esther Rantzen , was much taken with a dog who could say her name .
Dear little Prince will be long gone now , alas – but in the name of sanity , if there is a public - spirited talking canine out there , could it proceed straight to Luton South ?
Initially , Esther had pledged to stand in this constituency only if Southampton - based dry rot martyr Margaret Moran declined to resign .
Now Ms Moran has announced she will be standing down , you might reasonably have expected Esther to withdraw her threat … but I have to tell you no such undertaking has been received .
Bravely weathering the media attention , Esther is heading off to " take advice from Luton South " , a homogeneous entity she hopes will instruct her to run .
" I can resist everything except a challenge ! " she told the BBC with the coquettish trill she once used to reserve for genital - shaped carrots .
Unfortunately , it does n't end there .
Also mulling runs are resting TV presenter Lynn Faulds - Wood , as well as Terry Waite , Martin Bell and the Telegraph 's Simon Heffer , whose manifesto will promise armed apostrophe enforcement units .
Then there is former Dollar singer David Van Day , who was only recently Esther 's fellow contestant on I'm A Celebrity ...
Get Me Out Of Here .
David is eyeing Nadine Dorries ' Mid-Bedfordshire constituency .
Perhaps Mr Sulu could challenge Hazel Blears .
A fortnight ago , using this spot to call for an invigorating burst of independent MPs , I had the sinking suspicion that famous folk would regard a few years in Westminster as a fun addition to their story arc , and prayed they would stand humbly aside in favour of ordinary people such as Richard Taylor , the doctor who has been independent MP for Wyre Forest since 2001 .
That turned out well , then .
The list of prospective celebrity candidates is growing , though they will doubtless resent being lumped together .
Ms Rantzen will consider she has little in common with Mr Van Day – although , in the words of the old joke , one suspects both their answerphone messages say " I 'll do it " .
There is perhaps even more blue water between the careers of David and Martin Bell , but the point is that however debased the term might be today , both are celebrities .
Mr Bell has become one , whether he likes it or not , and there is already far too much emphasis on renown in public life .
Thinking this is somehow the solution to the expenses crisis is madness .
If we seriously seek to remake our democracy , or at the very least patch it up , we should shun the osmotic relationship between politics and showbiz that has been such a corrosive force in recent years .
Things have got very bad .
Not only does the World Economic Forum invite public intellectuals such as Sharon Stone to Davos , but it holds award ceremonies .
Angelina Jolie sits on a prestigious US foreign policy thinktank .
Geri Halliwell is sent to Washington to lobby congressmen , while congressional committees have become ever more celebrity - obsessed since 1985 , when Jane Fonda , Sissy Spacek and Sally Field were called as expert witnesses before a congressional hearing entitled " The Plight of the Family Farmer " .
Why ?
Because they had all played farm wives in movies .
The real reason , of course , is that famous people bring cameras , allowing legislators to get their faces on TV .
Yet it somehow feels even more screwed - up that a series of hasbeens who have exhausted their reality TV options now see Westminster as their next gig .
To complete our tumble down the rabbit hole , you can rest assured that the producers of I'm A Celebrity will now be targeting those MPs who submitted some of the more baroque expenses claims .
Heaven knows the former politicos will need a second act in their lives , to say nothing of the money – so we could find ourselves seeing Esther in parliament and Julie Kirkbride in the jungle .
Frankly , I have n't the appetite for making some gag about well - deserved bushtucker trials , because for all the superficial amusement , there is something wrong with our culture if the answer to every question is " Let 's call for a celebrity " .
The famous already have more than enough influence , and if we allow parliament to become another outpost of that , then we really will have moved into the age of celebrigarchy .
No , let talented so - called nobodies stand instead , and if they subsequently become renowned for their work as an MP , then we will rejoice that parliament is functioning well enough to provide its own persons of good note , as opposed to having to co-opt them from the entertainment industry .
In the meantime , might I reiterate the plea for talking dogs ?
I realise many gifted hounds are drawn to the bright lights of TV talent shows , but there must be others who will feel the calling of public service – and who realise the two are discrete career choices .
Perhaps celebrities could do the same .

It all came down in the end to a piece of paper .
Two years ago , the young Iranian - American Roxana Saberi did some translation work for the Expediency Council , a part of the Iranian government .
She made a copy of a classified document about the US - led invasion of Iraq .
Two years later that would lead to her being arrested , held for three - and - a - half months in Evin prison , charged with spying , and sentenced to eight - year jail term .
According to her lawyers , at her appeal hearing last week , Ms Saberi admitted to possession of the document , but denied passing it to a " hostile power " .
The court accepted her argument , and reduced her sentence from eight years to a two - year suspended term , which left her free to leave the country .
For anyone who knows Roxana Saberi , the idea that she was a spy was faintly ridiculous .
And working as a journalist without a press card would be the worst possible cover .
Ahmadinejad 's letter
The case grabbed headlines around the world .
Her father , Reza Saberi , said she became a symbol for press freedom .
But it was also the sight of the fragile - looking former beauty queen , against the might of the Islamic Republic .
Who could fail to be moved ?
The Iranian authorities do have good reason to fear foreign subversion
Her lawyers believe a letter from President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad , calling for her to be given her full legal rights , helped to secure her freedom .
Though he would fiercely deny it , perhaps Mr Ahmadinejad was sensitive to global public opinion .
Perhaps , despite much blustery rhetoric , he really is interested in dialogue with US President Barack Obama , and realised what a serious obstacle this case might become .
But , again according to Ms Saberi 's lawyers , intelligence and security officials argued to the end of her five - hour appeal hearing on Sunday against letting her go .
They were deeply reluctant to admit that their prize catch was really just an innocent goldfish that had swum into their nets .
Eventually the Iranian judges did accept that Ms Saberi was not a spy .
But it is also true that the Iranian authorities do have good reason to fear foreign subversion .
' One revolution enough ' Etched deeply in the Iranian psyche is the 1953 CIA and British - backed coup , in which the elected government of Mohammad Mossadeq was ousted .
More recently , in a typically heavy - handed and counterproductive move , President George W Bush made available tens of millions of dollars to pro-democracy groups here .
According to American newspaper reports , more money has been funnelled secretly to try to destabilise Iran , or at least to maintain a heightened level of surveillance .
The Iranian government fears - and the neo-cons in Washington hope for - a " velvet revolution " in Iran , similar to those that installed pro-Western governments in Ukraine and Georgia .
There are many , many people here deeply frustrated with their government
You do not have to be in Iran for long to realise : it is not about to happen .
Even the most westernised , most sophisticated citizens of smart north Tehran , do not want another revolution .
One is enough for anyone 's lifetime , they tell you .
But the Iranian government 's fears are quite telling .
They know you cannot have a velvet revolution without a large number of discontented people .
And there are many , many people here deeply frustrated with their government .
You can tell that by the stream of educated young people leaving , or eager to leave , for Germany , the United States , Britain or Canada .
They want a government that spends more time trying to sort out the economy , the traffic , the pollution , and spends less time raking over old grievances and chanting " Death to America " .
Warning to journalists ?
Those in positions of power in Iran must understand all of this .
But they see the world through a different lens .
Their filter of paranoia interprets many apparently innocuous events as plots against them .
With some justice , perhaps .
But keeping that sense of siege going , deliberately or otherwise , does not do any harm for their survival either .
Hence , one former beauty queen , photocopying one piece of paper , can be interpreted as part of a wider plot to undermine the Islamic Republic .
As so often in Iran , there are many more strands to the story , much we will never know .
The case of Delara Delabi did not generate the same level of reaction Perhaps the original intention in arresting Ms Saberi was to send a warning to journalists in Iran , foreign and domestic .
There is no doubt that a deep sensitivity exists here about foreign press coverage of Iran .
Every day it is picked over in detail on state TV and the newspapers .
I know my reports are pored over for any factual inaccuracies , or any suggestion of lack of respect towards Iran or its leaders .
Surely the authorities never anticipated the strength of foreign outrage over the case .
After all , the imprisonment of two distinguished Aids doctors , the Alaei brothers , hardly stirred more than a press release from Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International .
There was not even the same level of reaction for the execution of Delara Darabi .
The 23 - year - old woman was hanged for a crime allegedly committed while she was still a juvenile , while her appeal was still pending .
Her parents were not even allowed to visit her before she went to the gallows .
The other suspicion is that Roxana Saberi became a political pawn : her case was used by those trying to block any possible reconciliation between Iran and the United States .
Again , we shall never know .
We do know that Roxana is now safe and free .
Her friends around the world are delighted .
Her fellow journalists in Iran are wondering who will be next .

The UK economy shrank 1.9 % in the first three months of 2009 , according to gross domestic product ( GDP ) data from the Office for National Statistics .
The contraction was much worse than had been expected and was the biggest three - month decline in GDP since the third quarter of 1979 .
" It 's the weakest in 30 years - that 's extremely soft , " said George Buckley at Deutsche Bank .
GDP measures the value of all the goods and services produced by a country .
A decline of about 1.5 % had been expected following the contraction of 1.6 % in the previous three - month period .
This may go down as the week that defined Britain 's political and economic choices for at least a decade
Stephanie Flanders , BBC economics editor

Taken together , it was the worst six - month decline in GDP since the ONS began publishing the figures .
' Weakness to come '
The ONS figures also showed that GDP for the year to the end of March was down by 4.1 % .
The latest figures mean that GDP has now shrunk for three quarters in a row , and confirm that the economy is still deep in recession .
The biggest contributor to the decline was the manufacturing sector , which shrank by 6.2 % in the first three months of the year , having decreased by 4.9 % in the previous quarter .
" The last six months has seen the sharpest fall [ in GDP ] on record and the manufacturing number ... is a record , " Jon Beadle from the Office for National Statistics ( ONS ) told the BBC .

Only two sectors managed any growth at all : government output and the agriculture , forestry and fishing sector , both grew 0.3 % in the period .
Analysts suggested that this would be the worst contraction in the current recession .
" I very much doubt that GDP is going to contract at these sort of rates for any longer , but I do think it will still contract all throughout 2009 , " said George Buckley at Deutsche Bank .
" So there 's still a lot of weakness to come , but not as weak as we 're seeing today . "
Gloomy forecasts
The worse - than - expected figure casts doubt on the chancellor 's prediction that GDP for the whole of 2009 would only shrink by 3.5 % .
How to cope with recession " A contraction of at least 4 % is much more likely , " said Benjamin Williamson at the Centre for Economic and Business Research .
" Our latest forecast is for a 4.5 % contraction this year , making 2009 the steepest single year contraction in economic activity since the 5.1 % fall in 1931 . "
The International Monetary Funds predicted a 4.1 % decline for 2009 .
Chief Secretary to the Treasury Yvette Cooper said the government stood by its forecasts .
" We believe the economy will start to recover towards the end of this year , " she told the BBC .
' Optimistic ' But Conservative leader David Cameron said the figures showed the government had a wildly optimistic view of the state of the UK economy : " The chancellor gave a set of forecasts in the Budget , " he said .
" Everyone said they were over optimistic , and already , just a few days later , the next lot of official figures coming out shows that he 's been over optimistic , shows that what the government 's been doing has n't been working . "
James Knightley , an economist at ING Bank , said : " Today 's GDP report does again highlight how optimistic Chancellor Darling was in his budget assumptions . "
Alistair Darling had also predicted that GDP in the first three months of the year would be at a similar level to that seen in the previous quarter .
The ONS cautioned that the GDP figure was only its preliminary estimate and could be revised .
There was some better news for the economy in the latest retail sales figures .
Retail sales unexpectedly rose 0.3 % in March , making them 1.5 % above the level seen in March 2008 .

The devices are flat - another reason they are desirable as light sources
Researchers have demonstrated white , organic light - emitting diode ( OLED ) sources with the same efficiency as fluorescent light bulbs .
The result brings closer the prospect that OLEDs will be the flat - screen light sources of choice in the future .
The limited lifetime of the blue - emitting part of the devices means they survive for just hours , but new blue - emitting materials are on the horizon .
The results are published in the journal Nature .
There has been significant work in OLEDs in recent years , so that small displays and even televisions based on the technology are beginning to come to market .
Though much of the technology would be the same for lighting , the key word for light bulbs is efficiency - and OLEDs had not , until now , passed the efficiency benchmark set by fluorescent bulbs .
Two different types of organic polymers can be used in the devices : phosphorescent and fluorescent .
While fluorescent materials - the kind used in OLED displays and televisions - are significantly longer - lived , they are only one - quarter as efficient .
Recent research has therefore focused on optimising the efficiency and lifetime of devices based on phosphorescent materials .
Profit and loss I think if you went back five or 10 years and said this is where we 're going to end up , there would 've been all - round scepticism
John de Mello
Imperial College London Now , Karl Leo of the Institute for Applied Photophysics in Dresden and his colleagues have made the first devices to outperform fluorescent bulbs in the efficiency stakes .
To do that they had to reduce the sources of loss - stages in which electrical energy goes in but does not exit in the form of usable light .
They did this first by optimising the design in the emitter layer , where losses happen because charge carriers recombine rather than dumping their energy into the polymers that give rise to coloured light .
Another significant source of loss happens at the edge of the diode structure where the light is actually produced ; if it is not extracted efficiently , photons can bounce around inside it or be re-absorbed .
The team solved that problem by designing a particularly efficient , nano - structured interface to suck out more light than previous efforts .
" The combined result is that we achieve an efficiency which is for the first time higher than a fluorescent tube , " Professor Leo told BBC News .
Also , unlike previous white OLEDs , that efficiency does not decrease as the devices are turned up to produce higher - intensity light .
Very much like prior white OLEDs , however , the significant problem is that the devices degrade within an hour or two , because the polymers that produce the blue part of the light are unstable .
However , Professor Leo said that promising first results on stable , phosphorescent blue polymers are starting to emerge .
" I 'm personally convinced that it may take a few years , but chemists will solve this problem and find materials which are stable enough , " he said .
Roll call Fluorescent bulbs set the bar for large - scale , efficient lighting John de Mello , an optoelectronics expert at Imperial College London , described the work as " impressive " .
" I think if you went back five or 10 years and said this is where we 're going to end up , there would 've been all - round scepticism , " he said .
" But they 've shown that by taking existing materials and known methods , tweaking them a little bit , and addressing several issues in parallel you really can bring efficiencies up to parity with fluorescent tube lighting . "
Professor Leo suggested that by further improving the design of the part of the OLEDs that whisks the light out , efficiencies up to twice that of fluorescent bulbs could be reached .
For the moment , the devices are comparatively expensive because of the manufacturing methods the group employs .
But OLEDs , when the materials and designs are right , can be produced in so - called " roll - to - roll " manufacturing in which vast sheets are made , making them economical on a commercial scale .
" Commercially this is really an opportunity , " said Professor Leo .
" I 'm pretty convinced that in a few years OLEDs will be a standard in buildings . "

ComboFix is just as spartan as the screenshot here makes it look .
You download ComboFix , run it , and it takes care of the rest .
The basic ComboFix process looks like this :
It backs up your registry , checks to see if you have Windows Recovery Console installed , and then it goes to town on your system scanning away through 40 + stages .
When it 's done , ComboFix spits out a log file and lists all the malware it found , which ones it was able to remove , and which ones you 'll have to use your Google - fu to look up how to remove manually .
It is n't fancy , but it gets the job done and gives you a detailed report at the end to take to security forums for help if you need it .

Malwarebytes ' flagship application Anti-Malware is a shareware malware - removal tool .
The principle difference between the free and premium version of the application is real - time monitoring .
If you do n't need active scanning against threats , the free version uses the same database and does an admirable job ferreting out infections .
Anti-Malware was , for example , one of the few malware removal tools that could detect and remove the Antivirus XP 2008 , a spyware application that masqueraded as an antivirus app .
The Anti-Malware installation includes another application from Malwarebytes called FileASSASSIN — a helpful tool for deleting files locked by Windows .

Hijack
This stands alone in this Hive Five as being the least automated yet most likely to completely wreck your system if used incorrectly .
Hijack
This does a comprehensive scan of the state of your computer and reports back an enormous log file .
The tool makes no judgement on whether or not an application , browser modification , or registry entry is malicious or not .
It simply generates a list of things that could have been potentially altered or tampered with by spyware , malware , or other malicious programs .
Advanced users can look over the log themselves and determine what needs to be pruned .
If you 're not comfortable doing that , your best bet is to take the log file to a popular security forum like BleepingComputer or SpywareInfoForum and ask their armies of knowledgeable volunteer malware slayers to comb over it for you .
Alternately , while not a replacement for receiving expert help from people in the forums , Hijack This .de is a web - based Hijack
This log reader which is updated nightly .
You upload your log file , it scans the file for relevant entries and gives you links to articles on how to remove the malware found in the log .
Now that you 've had a chance to look over the contenders for top malware killer , it 's time to cast your vote and see who goes home with the crown .
A note about the poll : the option for " Other " is missing from this week 's poll .
We understand that the best way to get rid of malware is to hit it with multiple tools until the infestation is good and dead , but we'd like you to cast your vote based on the best possible ( single ) tool for the job , not on the scorched earth policy of using them all .
If you have an Other vote for a completely different malware - removal tool , we 're happy to hear it in the comments .

This week 's honorable mention goes to " Reformat " ( as in your hard drive ) as a last - ditch , foolproof solution to your malware problems .
Apparently sometimes when you find a mouse in the kitchen the only way to be sure there are n't any more of them in the walls is to burn the whole house down .
Have a malware horror story , a favorite tool , or a prevention tip you want to share ?
Sound off in the comments below .
Near the end of The Variable , Eloise Hawking leaves the hospital , and Charles Widmore creeps out of the shadows and approaches her .
He says his relationship with Penelope was one of the things he had to sacrfice .
Eloise replies ,
Sacrifice ?
Do n’t you talk to me about sacrifice , Charles .
I had to send my son back to the Island , knowing full well —
Charles interupts her before she can finish her sentence .
What , exactly , does Eloise Hawking know “ full well ” ?
Clearly she knows that she has sent Faraday to his doom , but does she know that it would be her younger self who would kill him ?
That ’s what Daniel himself , at the very end of the episode , believes .
After he is shot , and sees that it was Ellie who had shot him , he says to her :
You knew .
You always knew .
You knew this was gonna happen .
And you sent me here anyway .
If Daniel is right , then why would Eloise have sent him to the Island — why would she have manipulated him his whole life to become the scientist he became so he could go to the Island — just so she could shoot him 30 years ago ?
Despite tele­vi­sion , cell phones , and Twit­ter , tra­di­tion­al read­ing is still an impor­tant skill .
Whether it is school text­books , mag­a­zines , or reg­u­lar books , peo­ple still read , though not as much as they used to .
One rea­son that many peo­ple do n’t read much is that they do n’t read well .
For them , it is slow , hard work and they do n’t remem­ber as much as they should .
Stu­dents , for example , may have to read some­thing sev­er­al times before they under­stand and remem­ber what they read .
Why ?
You would think that schools teach kids how to read well .
Schools do try .
I work with mid­dle - school teach­ers and they tell me that many stu­dents are 2 – 3 years behind grade lev­el in read­ing pro­fi­cien­cy .
No doubt , tele­vi­sion , cell phones , and the Web are major con­trib­u­tors to this prob­lem , which will appar­ent­ly get worse if we do n’t empha­size and improve read­ing instruc­tion .
Some of the blame can be placed on the fads in read­ing teach­ing , such as phon­ics and “ whole lan­guage , ” which some­times are pro­mot­ed by zealots who do n’t respect the need for both approach­es .
Much of the blame for poor read­ing skills can be laid at the feet of par­ents who set poor exam­ples and , of course , on the young­sters who are too lazy to learn how to read well .
For all those who missed out on good read­ing skills , it is not too late .
I sum­ma­rize below what I think it takes to read with good speed and com­pre­hen­sion .
Read with a pur­pose .
Skim first .
Get the read­ing mechan­ics right .
Be judi­cious in high­light­ing and note tak­ing .
Think in pic­tures .
Rehearse as you go along .
Stay with­in your atten­tion span and work to increase that span .
Rehearse again soon .
1 ) Know Your Pur­pose
Every­one should have a pur­pose for their read­ing and think about how that pur­pose is being ful­filled dur­ing the actu­al read­ing .
The advan­tage for remem­ber­ing is that check­ing con­tin­u­ous­ly for how the pur­pose is being ful­filled helps the read­er to stay on task , to focus on the more rel­e­vant parts of the text , and to rehearse con­tin­u­ous­ly as one reads .
This also saves time and effort because rel­e­vant items are most attend­ed .
Iden­ti­fy­ing the pur­pose should be easy if you freely choose what to read .
Just ask your­self , “ Why am I read­ing this ? ”
If it is to be enter­tained or pass the time , then there is not much prob­lem .
But myr­i­ad oth­er rea­sons could apply , such as :
to under­stand a cer­tain group of peo­ple , such as Mus­lims , Jews , Hin­dus , etc .
to crys­tal­lize your polit­i­cal posi­tion , such as why a giv­en gov­ern­ment pol­i­cy should be opposed .
to devel­op an informed plan or pro­pos­al .
to sat­is­fy a require­ment of an aca­d­e­m­ic course or oth­er assigned read­ing .
Many of us have read­ings assigned to us , as in a school envi­ron­ment .
Or the boss may hand us a man­u­al and say “ Here .
We need you to read this . ”
Whether the order comes from a teacher or boss , we need to ask , “ What do you want me to learn from this ? ”
In the absence of such guid­ance , you should still for­mu­late your best guess about what you should learn and remem­ber from the read­ing .
2 ) Skim First
Some read­ing tasks require no more than skim­ming .
Prop­er skim­ming includes putting an empha­sis on the head­ings , pic­tures , graphs , tables , and key para­graphs ( which are usu­al­ly at the begin­ning and the end ) .
Depend­ing on the pur­pose , you should slow down and read care­ful­ly only the parts that con­tribute to ful­fill­ing the read­ing pur­pose .
Even mate­r­i­al that has to be stud­ied care­ful­ly should be skimmed first .
The ben­e­fits of skim­ming first are that the skim­ming : 1 ) primes the mem­o­ry , mak­ing it eas­i­er to remem­ber when you read it the sec­ond time , 2 ) ori­ents the think­ing , help­ing you to know where the impor­tant con­tent is in the doc­u­ment , 3 ) cre­ates an over­all sense and gestalt for the doc­u­ment , which in turn makes it eas­i­er to remem­ber cer­tain par­tic­u­lars .
Brows­ing on the Inter­net encour­ages peo­ple to skim read .
The way con­tent is han­dled on the Web is even caus­ing writ­ers to make wider use of Web devices , such as num­bered or bul­let­ed lists , side­bars , graph­ics , text box­es and side­bars .
But the bad news is that the Web style makes it even hard­er to learn how to read in - depth ; that is , the Web teach­es us to skim , cre­at­ing bad read­ing habits for in - depth read­ing .
3 ) Get the Mechan­ics Right
For in - depth read­ing , eyes need to move in a dis­ci­plined way .
Skim­ming actu­al­ly trains eyes to move with­out dis­ci­pline .
When you need to read care­ful­ly and remem­ber the essence of large blocks of text , the eyes must snap from one fix­a­tion point to the next in left - to right - sequence .
More­over , the fix­a­tions should not be one indi­vid­ual let­ters or even sin­gle words , but rather on sev­er­al words per fix­a­tion .
There are read­ing - improve­ment machines that train the eyes to fix­ate prop­er­ly , but few schools use them .
I know from per­son­al expe­ri­ence with such machines that they can increase read­ing speed marked­ly with­out a cost in low­er com­pre­hen­sion .
Poor read­ers who stum­ble along from word to word actu­al­ly tend to have low­er com­pre­hen­sion because their mind is pre­oc­cu­pied with rec­og­niz­ing the let­ters and their arrange­ment in each word .
That is a main rea­son they ca n’t remem­ber what they read .
Count­less times I have heard col­lege stu­dents say , “ I read that chap­ter three times , and I still ca n’t answer your ques­tions . ”
When I ask thought - pro­vok­ing ques­tions about the mate­r­i­al , they often can’t answer the ques­tions because they can’t remem­ber the mean­ing of what they read .
Even with straight­for­ward sim­ple mem­o­riza­tion ques­tions , they often can’t remem­ber , because their focus on the words them­selves kept them from asso­ci­at­ing what their eyes saw with their own pre-exist­ing knowl­edge and thus facil­i­tat­ing remem­ber­ing .
In short , to remem­ber what you read , you have to think about what the words mean .
I am not argu­ing against phon­ics , which in my view is vital for the ini­tial learn­ing of how to read .
But phon­ics is just the first step in good read­ing prac­tice .
At some point , the read­er needs to rec­og­nize whole words as com­plete units and then expand that capa­bil­i­ty to clus­ters of sev­er­al words .
Among the key tac­tics for good mechan­ics of read­ing , I list the fol­low­ing :
Make eye con­tact with all the text not being delib­er­ate­ly skimmed
See mul­ti­ple words in each eye fix­a­tion
Strive to expand the width of each eye fix­a­tion ( on an 8.5 ″ width , strive for three fix­a­tions or even­tu­al­ly two per line ) .
This skill has to be devel­oped in stages .
First , learn how do read at five or six fix­a­tions per line .

Broccoli compound targets key enzyme in late - stage cancer
An anti-cancer compound found in broccoli and cabbage works by lowering the activity of an enzyme associated with rapidly advancing breast cancer , according to a University of California , Berkeley , study appearing this week in the online early edition of the journal Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences .
( Firestone & Bjeldanes labs / UC Berkeley )
The compound , indole - 3 - carbinol , is already undergoing clinical trials in humans because it was found to stop the growth of breast and prostate cancer cells in mice .
The new findings are the first to explain how indole - 3 - carbinol ( I3C ) stops cell growth , and thus provides the basis for designing improved versions of the chemical that would be more effective as a drug and could work against a broader range of breast as well as prostate tumors .
" I think one of the real uses of this compound and its derivatives is combining it with other kinds of therapies , such as tamoxifen for breast cancer and anti-androgens for prostate cancer , " said coauthor Gary Firestone , UC Berkeley professor of molecular and cell biology .
" Humans have co-evolved with cruciferous vegetables like broccoli and Brussels sprouts , so this natural source has a lot fewer side effects . "
" This is a major breakthrough in trying to understand what the specific targets of these natural products are , " said coauthor Leonard Bjeldanes , UC Berkeley professor of toxicology .
" The field is awash with different results in various cells , but no real identification of a specific molecular target for these substances .
The beauty of identifying the target like this is that it suggests further studies that could augment the activity of this type of molecule and really specify uses for specific cancers . "
Brassica bites Gary Firestone and Leonard Bjeldanes recommend a serving or more of cruciferous vegetables every day to take advantage of their natural anti-cancer benefits .
Firestone ’s favorite broccoli recipe , which he eats nearly every day , is simple ; steam a crown of broccoli for about 10 minutes , or until tender , squeeze a lemon over it and enjoy .
Bjeldanes suggests substituting sliced or shredded raw cabbage for lettuce in salads , and says he likes to eat a dinner salad of salmon , tuna or chicken over shredded cabbage with a light olive oil - based dressing and adorned with walnuts , raisins and dried cranberries .
Whether or not you like Brussels sprouts , you ’ll love Firestone ’s simple recipe ( below ) for caramelized sprouts , or a more elaborate recipe created by Southern California gourmet cook Karen McRoberts .
Caramelized Brussels sprouts
1 lb. Brussels sprouts
1 shallot , minced
2 pinches of sugar
1 tablespoon olive oil Cut Brussels sprouts in half and steam until nearly done .
Saute shallots in olive oil until softened , add sugar and sprouts , and cook until the sprouts are brown and caramelized .
Roasted Brussels Sprouts with Crispy Prosciutto & Lemon Bread Crumbs By Karen McRoberts
Preheat oven to 450 degrees
For the Brussels sprouts :
2 lbs small Brussels sprouts , trimmed
4 Tbs. olive oil
Salt and pepper Toss Brussels sprouts with olive oil , salt and pepper until well coated .
Spread in one layer on a baking sheet .
Roast 20 - 25 minutes , checking and rolling them around after 15 minutes .
They should be well browned on all sides .
For the crispy prosciutto bits :
1/4 lb. thinly sliced prosciutto
2 Tbs. olive oil
While the Brussels sprouts are roasting , heat olive oil in a small saute pan .
Cut thinly sliced prosciutto into short strips , separate and drop into hot oil .
Fry as though it were bacon and cook until browned .
Drain on paper towels .
Prosciutto will crisp as it cools .
For lemon bread crumb topping :
2 slices fresh bread pulsed in food processor to coarse crumbs
2 Tbs. melted butter or olive oil
Zest of one lemon
Mix the bread crumbs with the melted butter and toss till evenly coated .
Spread onto a baking sheet in one layer and bake 5 - 7 minutes at 375 degrees until light golden brown .
As soon as the crumbs come out of the oven , toss with the lemon zest until evenly mixed .
May be made in advance and stored after cooled in an airtight container .
To serve :
Roll the Brussels sprouts ( warm or room temperature ) in the toasted bread crumbs , then top with crispy prosciutto bits .
Alternatively , serve all three components separately for each guest to compose individually .
NOTE : The prosciutto is very salty on its own .
There is no need to add additional salt to the bread crumbs or crispy bits .
Firestone , Bjeldanes and their colleagues showed that I3C inhibits the enzyme elastase , which at high levels in breast cancer cells heralds a poor prognosis : decreased response to chemotherapy , reduced response to endocrine treatment and reduced survival rates .
Elastase is an enzyme that shortens a cellular chemical , cyclin E , that is involved in controlling the cell cycle .
The shortened version of cyclin E accelerates the cell cycle , making cancer cells proliferate faster .
Firestone showed that I3C prevents the elastase shortening of cyclin E , thereby arresting development of breast cancer cells .
For more than 15 years , Firestone , Bjeldanes and their colleagues have studied the anti-cancer benefits of vegetables in the cabbage family that are lumped together in the genus Brassica and , because of their cross - shaped flowers , are often referred to as cruciferous vegetables .
Though the anti-cancer benefits have been recognized since the 1970s , the mechanism is only now being discovered , in part through the work of Firestone , Bjeldanes and their UC Berkeley colleagues .
" We have connected the dots on one extremely important pathway " by which indole - 3 - carbinol works , Firestone said .
In previous work , they found that indole - 3 - carbinol interferes with more than cell proliferation .
It also disrupts the migration and alters adhesion properties of cancer cells , as well as counteracts the survival ability of cancer cells , all of which are implicated in cancer cell growth .
To have such broad downstream effects , I3C must act at the beginning of a major cellular pathway , Firestone said .
The newly reported research pins this activity to elastase and its effect on cyclin E .
Bjeldanes noted that I3C is available as a supplement and is a preferred preventative treatment for recurrent respiratory papillomatosis , a condition involving non-malignant tumors of the larynx .
Improved versions of the chemical could thus help treat cancers other than those of the breast and prostate .
Graduate student Ida Aronchik and recent Ph.D. recipient Hanh H. Nguyen , along with colleagues in the Firestone and Bjeldanes labs , have already chemically modified I3C and boosted its activity in cell culture by at least a factor of 100 .
The lab teams currently are probing the elastase structure and how I3C interacts with it to identify the best parts of the I3C molecule to modify .
I3C is only one of many plant - derived chemicals , called phytochemicals , that Firestone is investigating in his laboratory as potential anti-cancer agents .
Among them is the anti-malarial drug artemisinin .
Last month , the Journal of Biological Chemistry accepted a paper by Firestone and his colleagues showing that artemisinin blocks prostate cancer cell growth by interfering with the same intracellular pathway as does I3C .
This pathway involves the transcription factor SP1 , which latches onto other genes to boost their activity .
" SP1 could be a generalized target of phytochemicals , " Firestone said .
" Phytochemicals work because they interact with and inhibit enzymes that control a host of cellular processes , including migration and adhesion . "
The research is supported by the National Cancer Institute .
Other coauthors of the paper are Gloria A. Brar , currently a graduate student at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology , and former UC Berkeley undergraduate David H. H. Nguyen , now a graduate student at New York University .
This is the same technique I have taught over 138,000 men and women in 157 countries to successfully treat their excessive sweating condition over the past 7 years !

Several nations have warships in the Gulf of Aden on anti-piracy patrols A Greek - owned ship with a Ukrainian crew has been hijacked by Somali pirates south - west of the Seychelles , a seafarers ' group says .
It came hours after a Portuguese warship thwarted an attack on a Norwegian vessel in the Gulf of Aden .
The warship , part of a Nato patrol , destroyed explosives its crew found when they captured the pirates .
Somali pirates have also told news agencies they seized a Ukrainian ship in the Indian Ocean late on Friday .
Reuters news agency quoted a pirate the vessel was carrying industrial equipment including white cars with the United Nations logo .
UN officials could not confirm the claim , says the BBC's East Africa correspondent Peter Greste , but pirates in the past have disrupted UN aid work by seizing ships loaded with emergency food supplies .
Saturday 's attack on the Greek ship , the MV Ariana , took place about 250 nautical miles ( 460 km ) from the Indian Ocean islands .
The vessel , said to be carrying 35,000 tons of soya , was sailing from the Middle East to Brazil , said Andrew Mwangura of the East African Seafarers Assistance Programme .
It is owned by a Greek company and managed by Seven Seas Maritime in London .
Distress call
In the earlier incident , the Portuguese warship , the Corte Real , sent a helicopter to help the oil tanker Kition after a distress call was made .
The incident happened about 100 miles ( 160 km ) from the Somali coast .

The Portuguese helicopter chased the pirates back to their " mother ship " , or command vessel , and briefly detained about 19 pirates , a Nato spokesman said .
Explosives and grenade launchers were discovered on the mother ship when Portuguese special forces boarded " with no exchange of fire " , Lt Cmdr Alexandre Santos Fernandes said .
" It was almost a kilogramme of high explosives .
If used correctly it can open a hole in the hull of a ship and sink her , " Lt Cmdr Fernandes said .
" It is the first time we have spotted high explosives on board a pirate ship , normally they just stick to AK - 47s and RPGs ( grenades ) . "
The 19 pirate suspects were released because they had not attacked Portuguese property or citizens .
In total , pirates are now holding 18 ships and some 300 crew for ransom .
Homecoming Meanwhile , the crew of a Philippine tanker have arrived back in the Philippines for an emotional reunion with their families .
The 23 men from Stolt Strength said they had spent the past five months - the longest time Somali pirates have held hostages - in fear of being shot .
" Daily life was always a combination of fear and helplessness , hopelessness , " said Captain Abelardo Pacheco .
" It was the most negative feeling one could experience , " he said , quoted by AFP news agency .
After the men met their families at Manila airport , crew member Rodel Barreta said he was delighted to be home .
" Of course we 're happy .
Who would n't be happy when you 're back with your family ? "

A study of about 3000 children in 32 schools in Germany found that installing water fountains , giving the children refillable water bottles , and using teaching lessons promoting the health benefits of water consumption reduced the risk of being overweight by 31 % .
The one year study , published in Pediatrics , weighed 2nd and 3rd graders in socially deprived areas and interviewed them about their water consumption .
In schools in the intervention group , water fountains were added and four lessons were presented to the kids about the health benefits of water consumption .
Water flow from the fountains was also measured .
Before the study period , there was no statistical difference between the two groups in the prevalence of overweight kids .
At the end of the year , after adjusting for the baseline prevalence of being overweight , the authors found a 31 % decrease in the risk of obesity in the intervention group .
After the study , researchers found that water consumption in the intervention group had increased by over 7 ounces per child per school day , and the fountains were in steady use throughout the year .
No mention was made about food consumption during the period , although no effect was found on soft drink and juice consumption in the intervention group .
While not a magic bullet for keeping kids in a healthy weight range , the study was a positive example of how small changes in daily routine can have a lasting impact on children ’s health .

I ’m on a layover at Scarlett O’Hara International Airport , long enough to raise a family .
The Boingo god smiled at me and I seem to have already paid to use the Internet here .
My flights yesterday were canceled due to weather in Chicago , which gave me more time to think about pig flu , in the company of a well - connected doctor who walked me through the medical and political issues that public health officials are facing .
There is no easy answer here ; but it would seem more difficult to justify under- reacting than overreacting .
er that a few other people have been thinking about it too .
I learned , for example , there was a conference in Mexico two weeks ago , and Barack was there , talkin’ drugs and walls and immigration and NAFTA and such , and he shook hands with a guy who spontaneously died , ostensibly of the Tortilla Flu , 24 hours ( wait , CNN is reporting that it was one week ) later .
Here is an article from the Daily Mail , for which I used to write horoscopes ( Cainer still writes them , and I can only vouch for their accuracy and for no other part of the newspaper ) .
I think that having Obama at the epicenter just before disaster strikes is , well , interesting .
Cam , who plays shortstop for Planet Waves and who is visiting from Australia , dropped in with this odd fact : a company called Baxter is doing quite well in the midst of this chaos , despite its recent grotesque misdeeds surrounding bird flu .
And here is some video that he dug up that will send chills down your spine .
It ’s as mainstream as it gets — MSNBC .
My mother wrote to me and said she sees “ conspiracy under every rock . ”
My mother ; there you have it .
What does your mother think ?
Tracy , the Astrology Programming Dutchess of Wales , dropped in with one of her perfect Pisces logic comments that summed the whole thing up , when I asked her what she thought : “ Most of the cases seem to be mild .
America conjunct Hylonome [ in the public health emergency chart , suggesting ‘ self inflicted situation for the United States and / or the Americas ’ ] .
I ’ve decided what I think .
I think the outbreak in Mexico has been reacted to in this way because it happened under this astrology , not the other way round if you see what I mean .
Anything that happens now can get blown out of proportion . ”
I see what JUST she means .
Fish eye view — chicken ?
egg ? egg carton ?
Benedict ?
which came first ?
I think she ’s getting at : we are seeing the astrology of a reaction and not an epidemic .
The whole Moon void of course , square Neptune , Chiron and Jupiter , feels like a Jaguar with the clutch down going into a spin .
Oh , we also discovered that Hidalgo ( all things Mexico ) is square the triple conjunction .
This is the astrology joking around with us .
Cheers to Padre Hidalgo , I love that old troublemaker .
Here are Tracy ’s asteroids .
Next , Melanie just appeared in my inbox , incredulous as usual .
She is questioning how the Moon can be void of course with all these asteroids running around .
The answer is that Moon void is an old rule so you use old planets .
Astrology is diviniation and you need a framework to operate within and we set this little rule that says that if the Moon is done making aspects to major planets ( and I do count the modern outer planets Uranus , Neptune and Pluto , as well as Chiron , though I will look at the chart both ways — with and without the modern outer planets , as a checkstop ) , then it ’s drifting ; it ’s ‘ void of course ’ .
You have to FEEL the Moon to feel the void .
It ’s not just an intellectual construction though it clearly is that , among other things .
There are usually minor planets in the vicinity of a void Moon , but like a foul ball in baseball , they do n’t quite count — but sometimes they are interesting .
Here is a 30 degree sort of that chart so you can get a look at how that works … skip downto the Moon ( search ‘ moon ’ in your browser once you ’re on that page and you will see all the minor planets that are in range of the Moon ) .
Do n’t let it make your head spin ; after a while it ’s like eating cupcakes .
I am not there yet .
It looks like the Moon ’s next aspect is a sextile to the asteroid Photographica — a cool asteroid .
I am noticing how few photos there are of this situation .
I keep seeing the same picture of the Mexican couple making out with blue masks on .
Has anybody mentioned that the masks do n’t protect the wearer — the mask over your face protects everyone else , in case you ’re infected ; it ’s the sneeze guard over the salad bar .
Speaking of masks .
Mandy in the UK , who is some kind of pedigree detective and the wife of a doctor for the public health service , said in reply to my query about what she wanted to add :
“ I ’ll tell the world about the UK emergency pack delivered to all family practitioners consists of a white envelope which contained two surgical masks , two pairs of latex gloves and two white plastic aprons …. plus a copy of a clinical protocol flow chart … ”
Yes !
Everything you need to stop an epidemic .
Or play doctor …
Gov. Arnold Schwarzenegger is proposing to completely eliminate the state ’s welfare program for families , medical insurance for low - income children and Cal Grants cash assistance to college and university students .
The proposals to sharply scale back the assistance that California provides to its neediest residents came in testimony by the administration this afternoon at a joint legislative budget committee hearing .
It followed comments by the governor earlier today that he would be withdrawing a proposal to help balance the budget with billions of dollars of borrowing and replacing it with program reductions .
The proposals would completely reshape the state ’s social service network , transforming California from one of the country ’s most generous states to one of the most tightfisted .
The proposals are intended to help close a budget deficit estimated at $ 21.3 billion .

The Whole Platform is an open source technology for engineering the production of software .
Based on the idea that programming is an activity concerning the development of domain languages , the Whole Platform provides an Eclipse - based Language Workbench for developing new languages , manipulating them using domain notations and transforming them using a generative model driven approach .
In using the Whole Platform , business knowledge can be expressed with domain specific languages and made independent of the technologies used to realize the products .
The introduction of domain languages and notations enables the problem domain experts to work together with the programming experts for the development of the software products : the former write the business knowledge , the latter write the generators .
The Whole Platform enforces an economy of scale .
The fact that the generators are coupled to the domain languages and not to a particular business knowledge expressed with them , means that the effort of the software development is not spent in a singular product but rather in building a software product line .
The languages bundled with the Whole Platform include :
modeling languages ;
query and transformation languages ;
data integration languages for grammars , XSD , RDB and Java libraries ;
and popular languages such as Java , JavaScript , Objective C and XML .

CAPTCHAs , typically in the form of an image comprised of a distorted string of random characters , are a fact of life on the Internet .
They 're typically used to prevent spammers from setting up e-mail accounts or posting links in forums and blog comments and , as such , have set off a bit of an arms race between service providers and spammers .
There have been several notable instances of CAPTCHAs being cracked by automated systems , and academic researchers have been exploring further vulnerabilities and developing alternate systems .
The latest entry in this arms race comes from researchers at Google , who have taken a new approach to foiling automated cracking systems : force them to attempt to orient specific images .
Google has some obvious reasons for being interested in improved CAPTCHAs , as the company provides both e-mail and blogging services that rely on them for security .
And , given that the text CAPTCHAs appear to be getting to the point where it 's harder for human users to accurately use them , a new approach seems to be due .
CAPTCHAs are based on the fact that humans tend to be better at image recognition problems than automated systems , so the Google researchers were apparently able to come up with the new technique simply by looking into areas that computer scientists had identified as being problematic for computer - based solutions .
They apparently came up with image orientation .
Humans can apparently properly orient a variety of images so that the vertical axis matches the real - world orientation of the photograph 's subject ; computers can only handle a subset of these .
The Google researchers describe how they used this to implement a system appropriate for end - users in a paper they will present at the WWW 2009 meeting this week .
The basic idea behind their scheme is that any functional system will first have to eliminate any images that an automated system is likely to handle properly , as well as any that are difficult for humans to orient .
So , for example , computers are good at recognizing things like faces in group shots , as well as horizons in landscape scenes , both of which provide sufficient information to orient the image .
In other cases , the image does n't have enough information for either humans or computers to properly sort things out — the paper uses the example of a guitar on a featureless background , which could be oriented horizontally , vertically , or in the angled position from which it 's typically played .
The authors started with a database of images obtained from the Web based on a collection of common user queries .
Orientation was inferred from the original picture , but this information was removed by applying a circular mask and then rotating the image a random number of degrees .
They then filtered out those that could be properly oriented by computers using a set of 180 automated image classifiers developed using AdaBoost .
They also eliminated images where these 180 evaluators produced widely divergent guesses , since this was an indication that the orientation was difficult to ascertain .
With that done , they used the remaining images to test humans , with a simple interface built with JavaScript and DHTML .
For humans , they found that using a combination of three images and allowing an error of up to eight degrees in either direction produced an 84 percent success rate ; random guessing would only accurately succeed 0.009 percent of the time .
The tests also identified a number of outliers , such as images that were difficult for humans to orient ( the guesses varied widely ) or where the subject had been photographed at an unusual angle ( the guesses were consistent , but different from the photo's original orientation ) .
In general , users also found the orientation of the images to be preferable to using text - based CAPTCHAs , with the exception of one person who apparently had a form of OCD that compelled her to tweak each image 's orientation to perfection ( my speculation , not the authors ' ) .
The authors note that the approach leaves plenty of room for further improvement , as the images could be obtained specifically from sources that computers are known to handle poorly , like cartoon content .
They also suggest that , should computerized cracking programs ever catch up here , it should be possible to extend the technique into the third dimension using 3D models .
Learn how to paint with oils , I believe may be the ideal medium for beginning artists .
Is is a great way to study , as your changes and corrections can be easily made .
When you apply and later find unwanted passages of color , they can simply be scraped off the canvas without any injury to the surface .
Colors can be painted over another , your actual drawing can be corrected , and all the aspect of your light and shadow application can be experimented with ..
Your painting session can be ended at any time , and picked up and continued at any time .
Beginners more than not , make oil their choice without considering other media at all due to a reverence for " true oil painting . "
Many artists want to produce pictures that show the actual brush stroke marks and textures .
Even an artist that might lean toward a specific medium may find , as I have , that with oils he can gain a quicker study of color subtleties and can gain a basic knowledge which can later be applied to the preferred medium ..
You will soon discover after some practice time , that there is more to oil painting than the visible quality of the actual brush stroke work .
Your chosen surface type , preliminary stain preparation of the surface , and the underpainting process come together to affect the finished result .
Make sure in your initial efforts that you work in a direct way , particularly when you are painting outdoors .
After awhile you might choose to experiment in the studio with various underpainting processes .
Also when learning how to paint choose a good box to store the different oil paints , brushes , palettes , and panels .
One very popular size for a paint box is 12x16 and another is 16 x 20 inches .
Try to find a box with a lid that is grooved in order to hold a canvas panel .
Usually Paint boxes are available in wood and metal .
You may find new plastic versions as well .
The choice of a metal box will be more expensive and will last a lifetime .
You can locate wooden boxes that are already painted or stained though they will cost more than unpainted paint supply boxes .
If you choose an unfinished box , put a complete coat or two of a good varnish , on the inside and outside .
This makes easier to wipe off left over paint for easy cleanup .

All I can type is that the man is obvious in love and not with his wife .
This information is from The State , the largest newspaper in South Carolina .
Next , obviously someone does not like Sanford or is out to get him , to leak this stuff to The State .
( fyi , The State received these emails around December of 2008 , will release all of the emails , tomorrow . )
Mark Sanford should RESIGN , he is a joke to the Republican Party , his state and an embarassment to his wife and kids .
Good Lord , when you are in the public eye and you are doing stuff like this , it will come out .
I still can't get over going all the way to Argentina to get some ..... on another note , Sanford emails were sent from his governor 's email account , are we thinking stupid here ???
From Gov. Sanford ,
Date : Thursday , July 10 , 2008 , 12:24 a.m .
“ One , tomorrow leave at 5 a.m. for New York and meetings .
Will think about you on its streets and wish I was going to be there later in the month when you are there .
Tomorrow night back to Philadelphia for the start of the National Governor 's Conference through the weekend .
Back to Columbia for Tuesday and then on Wednesday , as I think I had told you , taking the family to China , Tibet , Nepal , India , Thailand and then back through Hong Kong on world wind tour .
Few days home then to Bahamas for 5 days on a friend ’s boat for the last break of the summer .
The following weekend have been asked to spend it out in Aspen , Colorado with McCain - which has kicked up the whole VP talk all over again in the press back home ...
Two , mutual feelings ....
You have a particular grace and calm that I adore .
You have a level of sophistication that so fitting with your beauty .
I could digress and say that you have the ability to give magnificent gentle kisses , or that I love your tan lines or that I love the curve of your hips , the erotic beauty of you holding yourself ( or two magnificent parts of yourself ) in the faded glow of the night ’s light - but hey , that would be going into sexual details ...
Three and finally , while all the things above are all too true - at the same time we are in a hopelessly - or as you put it impossible - or how about combine and simply say hopelessly impossible situation of love .
How in the world this lightening strike snuck up on us I am still not quite sure .
As I have said to you before I certainly had a special feeling about you from the first time we met , but these feelings were contained and I genuinely enjoyed our special friendship and the comparing of all too many personal notes ...
Lastly I also suspect I feel a little vulnerable because this is ground I have never certainly never covered before - so if you have pearls of wisdom on how we figure all this out please let me know ...
In the meantime please sleep soundly knowing that despite the best efforts of my head my heart cries out for you , your voice , your body , the touch of your lips , the touch of your finger tips and an even deeper connection to your soul . ”

“ As I told you I should n't have done this trip but I would have felt worst if I would n't have come because it was too over the date , he is a very nice guy , great heart ... but unfortunately I am not in love with him ...
You are my love ... something hard to believe even for myself as it's also a kind of impossible love , not only because of distance but situation .
Sometimes you do n't choose things , they just happen ...
I can't redirect my feelings and I am very happy with mine towards you . ”

What do we want to see emerge from the greatest crisis of capitalism for 70 years ?
If I had to answer in a single phrase , I would say : new models for a sustainable social market economy .
This requires us to change as well as our states .
Capitalism will not end in 2009 as communism ended in 1989 .
It is too deep - rooted , too diverse and too adaptable to suffer such a sudden death .
There are far more varieties of capitalism in the world today than there ever were of communism , and that diversity is one of its strengths .
The rainbow reaches from wild west to wild east , and extends to major national variants of a market economy , such as China , that purists would say are not capitalism at all .
So some versions of capitalism will weather the storm ; others will be left in ruins or at least very substantially transformed .
An extreme " neoliberal " version of the free - market economy , characterised not just by far - reaching deregulation and privatisation but also by a Gordon Gekko greed - is - good ethos – and fully realised in practice only in some areas of Anglo - Saxon and post - communist economies – seems likely to find itself in the latter category .
But how about a modernised , reformed version of what postwar German thinkers called the " social market economy " ?
Very definitely still a free - market economy , this model nonetheless calls for the state to provide a strong legal and regulatory framework for private enterprise , for the involvement of stakeholders as well as shareholders , an attempt to balance long and short - term considerations in economic decision - making , a national commitment to a social minimum for all citizens , and a strong moral ethos among those involved in business activity .
This then needs to be combined with the 21st - century demands for ecological sustainability in the face of climate change , and ethical sustainability , in the face of ­global poverty .
A tall order , to be sure .
There 's also a question about the balance between the national and the international levels of regulation and governance .
Mervyn King , the governor of the Bank of England , has observed that today 's big private banks are global in life but national in death .
When it comes to the bailout , it 's the national government most directly concerned that takes the lead .
And that means us , national taxpayers , picking up the bill .
Yet all this talk of states and systems is only half the story .
It was the conduct of individual human beings that led us into this mess , and it is the behaviour of individuals as well as the structuring of systems that has to change .
This is most flagrantly obvious in the case of bankers , but we should not kid ourselves that it stops with them .
The conduct of the bankers who pitched us into the slurry - pit – not all bankers , of course , but quite a few of them – may not have been illegal but it was selfish , irresponsible and immoral .
Year after year , they took huge personal gains for themselves on the basis of assets whose real nature and prospects they either did not understand or cynically ignored .
Their pay and bonuses , out of all proportion to the sums almost everyone else was earning in the societies around them , were justified as " performance - related " , but " performance " was measured by inadequate indicators over too short a time - frame .
Remuneration at the top was based on competitive benchmarking against rivals , and big shots were heard to complain that it was " unfair " that someone else was earning £ 5 m a year while they were earning only £ 4 m a year .
Then they were laughing all the way from the bank .
" The City has been kind to me " was the very English euphemism for this baroque process of self - enrichment .
Not for the first time , novelists ( such as Tom Wolfe ) and filmmakers ( such as Oliver Stone with his Wall Street , featuring Gekko ) were ahead of economists and political scientists in identifying the disorder .
The classic justification for capitalists making large sums of money is the risk they take , but in this case they did not even take the risk .
We did .
When the bubble burst we , the taxpayers , were left to pick up the bill – and we and our children will be paying it for decades to come .
Near where I live in Oxford , vast Victorian mansions have been lavishly restored to single - owner occupancy , with no expense spared .
A year ago , I contemplated these mansions with wry amazement , but I naively assumed that their new owners had , in some real sense , earned their neo-aristocratic lifestyles .
Now I look at them with something close to anger .
A friend who has spent a lifetime studying the world 's poorest economies argues that such bankers should face personal legal consequences for their selfish folly .
There should , he suggests , be a crime of bankslaughter , comparable to manslaughter in the sense that you do n't have to prove malice aforethought .
A wonderful idea but not , I think , practical , or ultimately even desirable – since it would mean violating the fundamental legal principle that something is a crime only if it was illegal at the time you did it .
But I do think those directly responsible , such as Sir Fred Goodwin of the Royal Bank of Scotland , should return some of their excessive and undeserved personal gains .
And others should put back into society , if only in the form of philanthropy , more of what they have in effect taken from it .
Yet we can't blame it all on them .
Every ordinary Brit or American who spent money he or she did not have , encouraged by soaring house prices , lax mortgage lending and seductive advertising , bears a share of the responsibility .
So , oddly enough , do the super - frugal Chinese , whose massive savings were recycled to allow – even indirectly to encourage – western profligacy .
More than 30 years ago , Daniel Bell explored in his Cultural Contradictions of Capitalism the paradox that the dynamism of capitalism depends on individuals living by somewhat different values in their personal lives as producer and as consumer .
Extending Max Weber 's famous argument about the protestant ethic and the spirit of capitalism , he suggested that the production side depends on people harking to values such as hard work , punctuality , discipline and a readiness to accept deferred gratification .
The demand side , by contrast , depends on them being self - indulgent , expansive , pleasure - seeking and given to living in the now .
Add to this the new constraint that the planet will not sustain more than 6 billion people enjoying constantly rising living standards achieved by the methods of production and consumption so far used .
Complicate matters further by the moral argument that the world 's rich have no right to deny the world 's poor a materially better life , which would still be a fraction of the affluence we ourselves enjoy .
What you end up with is not just a systemic conundrum but also a personal challenge to every one of us .
The challenge is to find a new balance in our double - lives as producers and consumers , at the same time consciously contributing to a larger set of new international balances between economy and environment , oversaving east and overspending west , rich north and poor south .
That , too , is what I mean by a sustainable social market economy .

It ’s been a worrying month for the health of Mars Expedition Rover Spirit .
Two weeks ago , the embattled robot failed to wake up after three successive communication sessions , and then over the Easter weekend ( April 12th and 13th ) , mission HQ noticed the rover had rebooted its systems at least twice during use of the high - gain antenna .
The same thing happened on April 18th .
In addition to this , Spirit has been suffering bouts of what seems to be an ‘ electronic amnesia ’ , where the onboard computers have failed to record data onto their flash memory .
Today however , it would appear Spirit is still operational after over two weeks of remaining planted in the same position .
It managed to enact commands sent from NASA to start driving once more , trundling 1.7 metres over the Martian regolith .
She has n’t given up the good fight quite yet …
Since when have electronics on Earth ever lasted more than five years ?
I always seem to hit a two - year wall with my laptops when something nasty happens to the hardrive and / or motherboard ( usually a day or two after the warranty runs out ) .
But when we talk about the computers on board the Mars Expedition Rovers ( MER ) , these electronics are n’t in the snug safety of my office ; they are on the surface of an alien planet , dealing with extremes in temperature , high energy particles and copious amounts of dust .
What ’s more , the rovers were only designed to operate for a few months and yet they are still going strong , five years later .
It ’s the NASA mission that just keeps on giving .
I think this is what makes the MER mission so impressive for me .
Not only are Spirit and Opportunity still operational , they are operating 20 times longer than their designated lifetime and they are notching up a very healthy odometer count .
Their cumulative distance travelled is not measured in metres , or kilometres ; it ’s measured in tens of kilometres .
They are giving us an unprecedented insight to the Martian surface , information that will shape our understanding of planetary science for generations to come .
But like any planetary mission , times can be tough , and both rovers have been tested to their engineered limits .
Unfortunately , Spirit has been hit by a few more setbacks than Opportunity , but NASA has been able to find workarounds for each problem .
The Mars Science Laboratory has a lot to live up to , I wonder if the MER mission will still be operational when the MSL finally touches down ?
Perhaps the next generation rover will have a robotic welcoming party !
The most recent issue for Spirit has been the flash memory problem .
Flash memory helps the rovers store data even when they are powered down , but when the little rover forgets to actually store the data on the flash memory , something is obviously awry .
In an attempt to make sure the rover can still take commands and to see if the computer problems persist , NASA ordered Spirit to travel 1.7 metres toward a target 150 metres away .
All seems to be going well so far .
“ We expect we will see more of the amnesia events , and we want to learn more about them when we do , ” said JPL ’s Sharon Laubach , chief of the rover sequencing team , which develops and checks each day ’s set of commands .
“ We decided not to wait until finishing the investigations before trying to drive again .
Given Spirit ’s limited power and the desire to make progress toward destinations to the south , there would be risks associated with not driving . ”
Hopefully keeping the rover mobile will help NASA troubleshoot the recent computer problems , but so far , she ’s still rolling over the Martian dirt …

This provocative twist on the Bible ’s opening line was plastered on the side of 25 Chicago buses this week as part of an advertising crusade by the Indiana Atheist Bus Campaign .
The ads have been cruising between downtown and the city ’s North and South sides , including the No. 56 Milwaukee route , since the beginning of the week and will run through June .
" The intent of the campaign is to stimulate discussion of religion and its place in our society , " said Charlie Sitzes , a spokesman for the Indiana group who with help from the American Humanist Association has collected more than $ 10,000 in private donations to buy the ad space in Indiana and Illinois .
The group brought its message to Chicago after a similar campaign in Indiana – to post the slogan " You can be good without God " – was rejected by transit authorities in Bloomington and stalled by officials in South Bend , who did n’t want the ads posted in time for President Barack Obama ’s speech at Notre Dame .
Indiana 's chapter of the American Civil Liberties Union has sued the Bloomington Public Transportation Corporation on the atheist group 's behalf .
Bloomington Mayor Mark Kruzan has denounced his own transit system , saying he does not condone government censorship .
" It would appear that where there is more opposition to the message that maybe that would be the place where we needed dialogue more , " Sitzes said , maintaining that the slogan is a simple fact .
" All non -believers believe God is a creation of man , " he said .
" We used to have thousands of gods .
Now we ’re down to one .
We ’re getting closer to the true number . "
Among the guidelines for determining if an advertisement can run on the CTA is a requirement that the ad be truthful and is " not directed at inciting imminent lawless action . "
Last year , eight religious organizations advertised on the city ’s mass transit including Muslims , Roman Catholics , Christian Scientists and Seventh Day Adventists .
Trinity Christian College is the only religious organization currently advertising on CTA .
Sitzes regrets that the ad campaign– inspired by similar signs in Europe– has encountered so much opposition in his home state .
British ads sarcastically consoled passengers with the message : " There ’s probably no God .
Now stop worrying and enjoy your life . "
Last November , the American Humanist Association plastered buses in the nation ’s capital with pictures of a man in a Santa suit asking : " Why believe in a god ?
Just be good for goodness ’ sake . "
" [ Chicago ’s ] slogan makes the point that religion is a social , man -made creation – like literature , art , politics , and science – and as such , it should be subject to debate like everything else , " Sitzes said .
He said the perspective of atheists , agnostics and secular humanists are often ignored in the public square
" Atheists , agnostics and secular humanists have a unique perspective on the topic that usually gets ignored in public discussion , and we ’d like to make ourselves heard , " he said .
" The ads are n’t an attack on religious people but an affirmation of a different point of view . "
What do you think ?
Conversation starter or attack ad ?
It only took the Obama administration a couple of weeks to prove that the national leadership of the Democratic Party is guided by totalitarian - minded socialists who seek to create an omnipotent government .
The U.S. government is now controlled by people who have been dreaming of living out their utopian socialist fantasies ever since the fantasies were brought to their attention in college decades ago by their Mao / Castro / Che Guevara poster - hanging , capitalism - hating , communistic professors .
The administration ’s main agenda is an explosion of federal spending and debt so large and outrageous that America will soon exceed Sweden in the proportion of the economy that is controlled by government — if it has n’t already .
That ’s just for starters .
They also want to sharply increase taxes on the most productive and hardest - working people in society ; increase the capital gains tax to deter private investment ; expand the welfare state ; spend trillions on pure , pork barrel spending in a massive vote - buying spree ; set all corporate compensation levels by governmental fiat ; tax away the wealth of unpopular business people ( only starting with those AIG executives ) ; regulate and control all risk taking by private entrepreneurs ; enforce a civilian draft to create a modern - day , American version of the Hitler Youth ( See Rahm Emanuel ’s creepy , Stalinist - sounding book entitled The Plan ) ; nationalize entire industries , starting with the capital markets ( they understand that there can be no capitalism without private capital markets ) ; and double , triple , and quadruple the number of " regulators " who already regulate all aspects of human life in America .
At the recent G - 20 meeting Obama even signed off on the creation of an international regulatory " authority " that could set compensation policies in American corporations .
On top of this , there is a never - ending drumbeat of anti-capitalist propaganda coming from the administration and its worshipful mouthpieces in the " mainstream media . "
What can be done ?
How can this rush toward totalitarian socialism be stopped ?
Will the Republicans find another old , angry geezer to appeal to the angry white male vote ?
How about another mumbling and incompetent Bush family heir ?
Will there be another Reagan who will talk libertarian while governing more like a European Social Democrat ?
Will they trot out another old " war hero " who will plunge us into war with Iran , North Korea , China , or whomever , to divert our attention away from the economic mess government has placed us in ?
These are the likely alternatives if we cling to the fantasy that " throwing the bums out " at election time leads to something other than another group of slightly different bums .
The fact is that the American people have been servants or slaves to their government for generations .
It was n’t always that way .
When the Adams administration enforced the Sedition Act that made criticism of the federal government illegal , Jefferson and Madison responded with the Virginia and Kentucky Resolves of 1798 that clearly stated that the people did not intend to allow the enforcement of this unconstitutional law within those two states .
Section One of Jefferson ’s Kentucky Resolve stated , for example , that " the several States composing the United States of America , are not united on the principles of unlimited submission to their General Government . . . "
Other states supported Jefferson and Madison in their defense of free speech .
When President Thomas Jefferson imposed a national trade embargo and consummated the Louisiana Purchase , New Englanders , led by George Washington ’s Secretary of State , Timothy Pickering , loudly threatened to secede .
They decided against it ( for practical economic and political reasons ) at the Hartford Secession Convention of 1814 , but their actions sent a clear message to national politicians .
Outraged by the embargo , the Massachusetts legislature used the language of Jefferson ’s own Kentucky Resolve to proclaim that the embargo " was not legally binding on the citizens of the state " while denouncing the federal law as " unjust , oppressive , and unconstitutional " and reminding President Jefferson that " this state maintains its sovereignty and independence . . . "
All the New England states , plus Delaware , did the exact same thing and nullified the embargo .
When Alexander Hamilton ’s Bank of the United States , a precursor to the Fed , created 72 percent inflation in the first five years of its existence and corrupted politics with its politicized spending policies , citizens all over the country assisted President Andrew Jackson in eventually destroying the institution .
The heroic Ohio legislature slapped a $ 50,000 / year tax on each branch of the BUS , attempting to drive it out of business .
" The states have an equal right to interpret the Constitution for themselves , " announced the Ohio legislature , and it decided that the BUS was not constitutional .
Kentucky , Tennessee , Connecticut , South Carolina , New York , and New Hampshire followed suit .
When the War of 1812 broke out the New England states effectively seceded from the union by refusing to participate .
A proclamation by the Connecticut legislature was representative of the opinions of New Englanders : " [ I ]t must not be forgotten that the state of Connecticut is a FREE SOVEREIGN and INDEPENDENT State ; that the United States are a confederated and not a consolidated Republic , " and that it was refusing to support the war .
When the 1828 " Tariff of Abominations " created an average tariff rate of 45 % , applying mostly to Northern manufactured goods , South Carolinians clearly understood that this was a pure act of political plunder at their expense .
They convened a political convention to utilize the Jeffersonian idea of nullification and refused to collect the tariff .
They even got the South Carolina legislature to allocate $ 160,000 for the purchase of firearms with which to fend off any would - be federal tax collectors .
The result was that they forced the federal government to lower the tariff rate .
During the 1850s the " middle states " of New York , Pennsylvania , Delaware , Maryland , and New Jersey developed a very active secession movement that sought to either join a Southern confederacy , form a middle - states confederacy , or support Southern secession .
( See The Secession Movement in the Middle States by William C. Wright ) .
Their overriding desire was to separate themselves from the imperious New England Yankees .
When the Southern states seceded in 1860 — 61 , Abraham Lincoln pledged his everlasting support for Southern slavery in his first inaugural address , an address in which he endorsed a constitutional amendment ( the " Corwin Amendment " ) that would have forbidden the federal government from ever interfering with slavery .
In the same speech he promised a military invasion and " bloodshed " in any Southern state that ceased paying his beloved tariff on imports which , at the time , accounted for more than 90 % of federal tax revenue .
The average tariff rate had just been doubled by the Republican - controlled Congress .
The Southern states , along with most people in the North , still held the Jeffersonian belief that governments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed , and when that consent is withdrawn the citizens have a duty to abolish the existing government and form a new one .
Jefferson never wrote in the Declaration of Independence that the citizens have a duty to abolish the government and form a new one " as long as the other states all agree that you may do so . "
If the right of secession depends on someone else ’s permission , then one does not have a right of secession .
That was a fantasy invented by Lincoln , which he used to " justify " waging total war on his own country , murdering some 350,000 American citizens , including some 50,000 civilians .
From that time on , government in America was no longer " for the people , by the people , of the people , " as Chief Justice John Marshal once said in a phrase that was later plagiarized by Lincoln .
From that time on the purpose of government has been for those who run it to plunder those who do not .
Nullification and secession were no longer tools with which the citizens could control their own government .
The final nails in the coffin of government by consent were pounded in during the year 1913 with the advent of the federal income tax , the creation of the Fed , and the Seventeenth Amendment calling for the direct election of U.S. senators .
The income tax and the Fed gave the federal government the ability to do whatever it wanted to do regardless of the Constitution — even to wage " undeclared " wars .
These vast " riches " were used to make millions of Americans totally subservient to the state lest they lose their tiny government subsidies , and to bribe or threaten state governments to do whatever our masters in Washington , D.C. decree , lest they lose their cherished federal highway grants .
The ability of the citizens to oppose the federal Leviathan by organizing political communities at the state and local levels was finally destroyed and the centralized , monopolistic bureaucracy that rules America and much of the rest of the world today was created .
The direct election of U.S. senators , as opposed to the original system of having them appointed by state legislature , ended popular control of the federal government .
Today , candidates for the senate go to New York , California , China , or wherever the big money is that can be raised as " campaign contributions " to finance their political careers .
The interests of such " contributors " are not necessarily congruent with those of the folks back home .
If American citizens are to resist the rush to Obammunism they must first give up on the fantasy that the Republican Party is anything but another cabal of crooks , conmen and clowns , just like the Democratic Party .
The only realistic route to freedom , including a restoration of genuine free enterprise , is through the devolution of power away from Washington , D.C. via peaceful secession and nullification , the original American ideals .
Thomas Jefferson understood that democracy could never work in a country as large as the U.S. , let alone one with more than 300 million people .
In a January 29 , 1804 letter to Dr. Joseph Priestly he wrote : " Whether we remain one confederacy , or form into Atlantic and Mississippi confederacies , I believe not very important to the happiness of either part .
Those of the western confederacy will be as much our children & descendants as those of the eastern . "
On the topic of secession , Jefferson continued : " [ D ] id I now foresee a separation at some future day , yet I should feel the duty & the desire to promote the western interests as zealously as the eastern , doing all the good for both portions of our future family which should fall within my power . "
When the New England Federalists were threatening secession , Jefferson wrote to his friend John C. Breckinridge on August 12 , 1803 that if New England seceded and created a second confederacy , " God bless them both if it be for their good , but separate them , if it is better . "
Unlike Lincoln , Jefferson did not believe in threatening " bloodshed " in the case of a " separation " or secession .
He understood that such behavior would be a moral abomination and an unimaginable act of barbarianism .
A civilized society does not wage total war on " our children , " as Jefferson described the future citizens of a new state formed by an act of secession .
Yet it is Lincoln , not Jefferson , who is portrayed by American court historians as a kindly , benevolent , and charitable angel .
The Constitution long ago ceased placing any meaningful limits on governmental power .
This social contract between the American people and their government was destroyed long ago by Hamiltonian nationalists .
Americans now live under a series of dictators ( called " presidents " ) who all believe that they are essentially dictators of the world , capable of ordering the bombing of any place on earth without anyone ’s approval .
( Within weeks , Obama dipped his hands in blood by ordering a few bombs to be dropped in Pakistan ) .
As of this writing , several dozen states have reportedly issued resolutions in support of the Jeffersonian principle of nullification .
These will all be completely meaningless unless the American public has the fortitude to actually enforce the resolutions and begin ignoring any and all federal government actions that they interpret as unconstitutional and illegitimate .
In addition , citizens of every state should learn about the Second Vermont Republic which , for several years now , has been laying the groundwork for Vermont to secede and once again become an free and independent republic , just as all the states thought of themselves as being prior to 1865 .
The Best of Thomas DiLorenzo
Fifteen months ago Chris Downey was just another green architect , based in Oakland .
Now he has an expertise that separates him from every other architect in the Bay Area and all 20,000 attendees at this week 's American Institute of Architects ' National Convention in San Francisco .
Downey , 46 , is a blind architect dedicated to planning buildings for blind people , a niche brought about by his sudden loss of sight after surgery .
" It is actually pretty exciting , " says Downey , as he sits in a drafting room , like everybody else at SmithGroup Inc. in the Financial District .
Then he rises to 6 feet 4 , grabs a white cane with one hand and reaches out with the other , grasping for something to shake .
" For someone who likes problem solving , this is quite a challenge , " says Downey , who has been working up floor plans in braille to submit to blind clients overseeing the design of a new blind rehab center at the Veterans Affairs center in Palo Alto .
" It 's a question of how do you design an environment for people that are n't going to see it ? "
Right .
But there is one question before that .
As he puts it , " Blind architect .
What a preposterous idea .
How does that work ? "
The answer starts with a benign tumor that had slowly encircled the intersection of optic nerves .
The tumor began to push the nerves out of position , and that 's when Downey could n't follow the flight of a baseball as he played catch with his son , Renzo , now 11 , at home in Piedmont .
Next Downey was hitting stuff in the road , during the 100 miles he'd do weekly on his bicycle .
Still , he could get his work done with the aid of glasses .
His eyeballs looked fine , but an MRI revealed a non-malignant golf - ball - size growth causing the blind spots .
" If it were n't for playing baseball with my son and riding my bike , who knows when I would have figured it out , " he says .
Because of the tumor 's proximity to the optic nerve , radiation treatment to shrink it was not an option .
He had surgery on St. Patrick 's Day 2008 to try to correct his vision , even though he was aware that it was risky and might not work .
Downey 's father , a physician , had died of complications from brain surgery at 36 , so waking up after the procedure at all made Downey feel " pretty darn lucky . "
Luckier still that he had blurry vision , as expected .
" It was amazing , " he recalls .
" It was a 9 1/ 2 - hour procedure , and the next day I was up walking around . "
When he awoke on the second day , his field of vision had been cut in half horizontally , as if the water were at eye level in a swimming pool .
By the third day he'd lost vision in the top half , too .
It varied from dark to light for five days , then it faded to black .
" I lost my sight , " says Downey , who knew going in that this was a risk .
" But I came out pretty darn healthy , with the exception of the sight . "
He accepted blindness right away .
What he could not accept was the advice of a social worker who came in and immediately started discussing a career change .
Every step he had taken since junior high in Raleigh , N.C. , had been toward becoming an architect .
He had seven years of schooling into it , topped by a master 's degree from UC Berkeley in 1992 .
Since then , he had designed aquariums , libraries , theaters , stores and homes .
He tried returning to the job he'd started a few months before he became ill , but was laid off before Christmas .
He searched the Internet , and found one blind architect in Lisbon , Portugal , and a guy who works as a forensic architect , investigating failures in buildings .
That was it .
On a whim he called Patrick Bell , a business adviser to architecture firms , and that 's when Downey finally got some decent Irish luck .
As it happened , Bell was working with a firm called the Design Partnership , which is doing a joint venture with SmithGroup to design a 170,000 - square - foot Polytrauma and Blind Rehabilitation Center for the Veterans Administration Palo Alto Health Care System .
Bell made the connection , and Downey was hired as a contract architect .
" It 's the first time any of us have dealt with even a sight - impaired architect , let alone one who is blind , " says Kerri Childress , VA spokeswoman .
" It 's really been beneficial having an architect who is blind working on a facility to serve the blind . "
The design phase runs through July .
From there , Downey has been invited to serve as a mentor to blind high school students at a weeklong event this summer in Maryland .
( He 's also back to cycling on a tandem bike with his buddy steering , and is up to 60 miles in the Oakland hills . )
And he would n't mind addressing next year 's AIA convention in Miami .
" I was always nervous in front of crowds , " says Downey , " but now that I can't see them , I think it will make it easier . "
On the Internet within this year in Japanese , English , German , French , more
According to the April 3 edition of the Nihon Keizai Shimbun paper , the entertainment conglomerate Bandai Namco Holdings is aiming to distribute its franchise of Gundam science - fiction anime series in 10 languages worldwide within this year .
It plans to release the programs in Japanese , English , German , French , and other languages through the Internet .
The newspaper report states that the online distribution of the Gundam series will precede television airings and tie into related merchandise .
The report does not state which specific titles will be released , nor which distribution options will be used .
The first Mobile Suit Gundam television anime series marks its 30th anniversary next Tuesday .
Last December , Bandai began streaming anime episodes of its Tamagotchi virtual pet franchise on the YouTube video - sharing site for free in seven languages .
In February , the North American anime distributor Bandai Entertainment announced that it is streaming the Code Geass : Lelouch of the Rebellion and Mobile Suit Gundam 00 anime series on YouTube as well .
Sunrise , a Bandai Namco Group anime production company , animated both titles .
In January , Kurokami The Animation premiered on television in Japan , South Korea , and the United States within 24 hours of each other .
The American release was handled by Bandai Entertainment .

Update : Additional information added .
French - language news magazine L’Express reports that the Israeli Air Force recently held air refueling drills between Israel and the small British held territory of Gibraltar , a 3,800 km flight which is leading some to speculate the the nation is making “ concrete preparations ” for a potential attack against rival Iran .
The report comes just days after Israeli Foreign Minister Avigdor Lieberman told Austria ’s Kleine Zeitung that Israel would not attack Iran , even if the US - led sanctions against the nation failed to get them to abandon their civilian nuclear program .
Speculation about a potential Israeli attack against Iran has been fueled for years by repeated threats by Israeli officials to do exactly that .
The revelation of the preparatory drills , coupled with comments by Israel ’s incoming Ambassador to the United States Michael Oren , are resurrecting concern about the attack despite Lieberman ’s attempt to quell concern , inconveniently enough as the controversial Israeli FM heads to Europe .
People with cancer can reduce post - chemotherapy nausea by 40 percent by using ginger supplements , along with standard anti-vomiting drugs , before undergoing treatment , according to scientists at the University of Rochester Medical Center .
About 70 percent of cancer patients who receive chemotherapy complain of nausea and vomiting .
" There are effective drugs to control vomiting , but the nausea is often worse because it lingers , " said lead author Julie L. Ryan , Ph.D. , M.P.H. , assistant professor of Dermatology and Radiation Oncology at Rochester 's James P. Wilmot Cancer Center .
The research will be presented at the American Society of Clinical Oncology meeting in the Patient and Survivor Care Session on Saturday , May 30 , in Orlando , Fla .
" Nausea is a major problem for people who undergo chemotherapy and it's been a challenge for scientists and doctors to understand how to control it , " said Ryan , a member of Rochester 's Community Clinical Oncology Program Research Base at the Wilmot Cancer Center .
Her research is the largest randomized study to demonstrate the effectiveness of ginger supplements to ease the nausea .
Previous small studies have been inconsistent and never focused on taking the common spice before chemotherapy .
The Phase II / III placebo - controlled , double - blind study included 644 cancer patients who would receive at least three chemotherapy treatments .
They were divided into four arms that received placebos , 0.5 gram of ginger , 1 gram of ginger , or 1.5 grams of ginger along with antiemetics ( anti-vomiting drugs such as Zofran® , Kytril® , Novaban® , and Anzemet® . )
Patients took the ginger supplements three days prior to chemotherapy and three days following treatment .
Patients reported nausea levels at various times of day during following their chemotherapy and those who took the lower doses had a 40 percent reduction .
Ginger is readily absorbed in the body and has long been considered a remedy for stomach aches .
" By taking the ginger prior to chemotherapy treatment , the National Cancer Institute - funded study suggests its earlier absorption into the body may have anti-inflammatory properties , " Ryan said .
Rochester 's Community Clinical Oncology Program Research Base is a national cooperative research group funded by the National Cancer Institute .
The Wilmot Cancer Center team specializes in improving the quality of life of people who have cancer .
There was back and forth between Ms. Greene and American Girl executives about how to handle certain situations , including the fact that in the first book Rebecca and her father work in his Rivington Street shoe shop on Saturdays , the Jewish Sabbath .
“ There were full meetings about that , ” said Ms. Dennis , who learned a lot about Judaism during the project .
“ There were so many different styles of Jewish practice , some stricter than others , in 1914 and today .
What our research told us was the greater pressure during that time period was assimilation and blending in and becoming American . ”
As Ms. Greene worked on the books , company designers set about figuring out what Rebecca should look like .
The company ’s research had found that Rebecca ’s Russian - Jewish descent allowed a range of physical characteristics , creating a wide palette of choices , said Megan Boswell , the director of design and development .
Facial structure is not typically an issue because the company generally chooses from an existing set of molds .
Hair color was a big issue , debated for years .
At first it was a dark auburn , but it was thought that might be too untypical .
Ms. Boswell said .
Then dark brown , the most common hair color for Russian - Jewish immigrants , was discussed .
But perhaps that would be too typical , too predictable , failing to show girls there is not one color that represents all Jewish immigrants .
“ In the end , after many discussions weighing out the advantages of both approaches , ” Ms. Boswell said , “ we created what we felt was an optimum combination and gave her a new mid-tone brown hair color with russet highlights . ”
This is not the first Jewish American Girl .
The company has a series called “ Girl of the Year , ” which features contemporary characters , each available only for 12 months .
The character for 2001 was Lindsey Bergman , and the opening of her only story book does not display the same misty affection for Jewish culture as do the Rebecca stories .
Lindsey , as narrator , describes a matzo ball that is flung across a room : “ If you do n’t know what a matzo ball is , I ’ll tell you , ” she narrates .
“ It ’s a slippery , dumpling - like blob of mush that floats around in chicken soup . ”
Eleven people have been taken to hospital after coming across barrels containing toxic chemicals on Victoria 's southern coastline this afternoon .
The barrels were found this afternoon by two groups of people - one at Harmers Haven , south of Wonthaggi , and the other at the mouth of the Powlett River .
Upon examining the barrels , people from both groups fell ill , Rural Ambulance Victoria spokeswoman Gabrielle Degenhardt said .
Country Fire Authority hazardous materials crews gave the affected people " emergency chemical showers " to decontaminate them , Ms Degenhardt said .
Eleven people were taken to Wonthaggi Hospital - none was believed to be seriously injured .
The origin of the barrels is as yet unknown .
More than 10 million people in eight different countries are at serious risk for cancer , respiratory diseases , and premature death because they live in the 10 most polluted places on Earth , according to a report by the Blacksmith Institute , a nonprofit organization that works to identify and solve specific environmental problems worldwide .
Top 10 Worst Polluted Places
Chernobyl in Ukraine , site of the world ’s worst nuclear accident to date , is the best - known place on the list .
The other places are unknown to most people and located far from major cities and populations centers , yet 10 million people either suffer or risk serious health effects because of environmental problems ranging from lead contamination to radiation .
“ Living in a town with serious pollution is like living under a death sentence , ” the report says .
“ If the damage does not come from immediate poisoning , then cancers , lung infections , developmental delays , are likely outcomes . ”
“ There are some towns where life expectancy approaches medieval rates , where birth defects are the norm , not the exception , ” the report continues .
“ In other places , children 's asthma rates are measured above 90 percent , or mental retardation is endemic .
In these places , life expectancy may be half that of the richest nations .
The great suffering of these communities compounds the tragedy of so few years on earth . "
The Worst Polluted Sites Serve as Examples of Widespread Problems
Russia leads the list of eight nations , with three of the 10 worst polluted sites .
Other sites were chosen because they are examples of problems found in many places around the world .
For example , Haina , Dominican Republic has severe lead contamination — a problem that is common in many poor countries .
Linfen , China is just one of several Chinese cities choking on industrial air pollution .
And Ranipet , India is a nasty example of serious groundwater pollution by heavy metals .
The Top 10 Worst Polluted Places
The Top 10 worst polluted places in the world are :
Chernobyl , Ukraine Dzerzhinsk , Russia Haina , Dominican Republic Kabwe , Zambia La Oroya , Peru Linfen , China Maiuu Suu , Kyrgyzstan Norilsk , Russia Ranipet , India Rudnaya Pristan / Dalnegorsk , Russia
Choosing the Top 10 Worst Polluted Places
The Top 10 worst polluted places were chosen by the Blacksmith Institute ’s Technical Advisory Board from a list of 35 polluted places that had been narrowed from 300 polluted places identified by the Institute or nominated by people worldwide .
The Technical Advisory Board includes experts from Johns Hopkins , Hunter College , Harvard University , IIT India , the University of Idaho , Mount Sinai Hospital , and leaders of major international environmental remediation companies .
Solving Global Pollution Problems
According to the report , “ there are potential remedies for these sites .
Problems like this have been solved over the years in the developed world , and we have the capacity and the technology to spread our experience to our afflicted neighbors . ”
“ The most important thing is to achieve some practical progress in dealing with these polluted places , ” says Dave Hanrahan , chief of global operations for the Blacksmith Institute .
“ There is a lot of good work being done in understanding the problems and in identifying possible approaches .
Our goal is to instill a sense of urgency about tackling these priority sites . ”

( Editor 's note : Unlike past recessions , the current downturn has taken a significant toll on sectors of the economy virtually unscathed by earlier economic crises .
This is the first installment of one middle - class family 's struggle . )
SKOKIE , Ill. , April 20 ( UPI ) --
The recession hit us last autumn .
We did n't know , however , just how disastrous things would get until -- in an instant -- we had no money .
Advertisement
In early March , we tried to transfer funds from our home equity credit line to pay a bill .
There was no money available .
Our lender had reappraised our house , depreciating the value by more than $ 100,000 , and wiping out the money that would have carried us for at least a year .
When my husband learned in mid-November his last day of work would be Dec. 31 , he was n't too worried .
He 'd always enjoyed long - lasting jobs with easy transitions and had never experienced unemployment .
He was shocked when he did n't get another position open at his company .
As December wore on with no prospects , we tightened our belts .
Like most middle - class families , we 'd tried to do everything right .
We 'd bought into the American Dream .
We had n't been affected by past recessions .
We purchased our house in north suburban Chicago 17 years ago , when our youngest was 2 years old .
It was perfect for us -- comfortable in size and layout for a family of five .
We have lived and loved joyfully here .
Our home has been a favorite gathering place for our kids and their friends , and we hope someday it will be the same for our grandchildren and their buddies .
Just before my husband 's layoff , we 'd started living on the edge of our means .
Although we'd never incurred debt and always paid our monthly bills , we 'd begun to dip occasionally into the home equity line to pay those bills .
We 'd reassured each other this would n't go on long .
Of course I 'd work again soon .
During our dual unemployment , however , we relied primarily on that equity credit line .
Now , with no jobs or equity line funds , we 'll have only my husband 's pension from another company where he'd worked for 20 years and his unemployment checks , which are greatly diminished because I had resigned from my last teaching job .
We sat stupefied for a while , unable to utter the words characterizing our now - desperate situation : bankruptcy , foreclosure , homelessness , destitution .
We both felt foolish -- we should have glanced up from our job searches , focused on nose - diving housing values , examined the terms of our loan agreement and yanked the remaining funds before the lender could .
But who 'd ever think of something like that ?
We phoned several friends with similar loans to give them a heads - up .
We were frantic ; what to do first ?
Call the mortgage lender ( we might be eligible for refinancing under President Obama 's stimulus package -- but that or other options would n't lower our payments enough ) ; negotiate payment plans for bills as yet unpaid that month ; put as many college loans as possible on three - year deferment ; implement austerity measures ( absolute necessities only -- cancel the few subscriptions to which we 'd still clung , draft a new budget ) ; turn the heat down to 58 degrees where it 'll never kick on ; eat little .
It has n't been all bad , though .
Our friends and relatives have come up with creative ways to buoy our sanity , including more invitations to dinner than we 've ever had !
Stay tuned .
The Pirate Bay verdict last week , crowed about by content owners , caused a very different reaction among self - styled digital pirates .
" Sweden is also presently a country in RAGE because of the clearly political motivated and big money — oops , I meant Big Content manipulation of our legal system , " wrote one .
Conspiracy theories abounded .
In a Web interview on Friday , defendant Peter Sunde Kolmisoppi even wondered aloud about the fact that a movie industry lawyer issued a statement praising the court 's reasoning only minutes after the verdict was issued ( Kolmisoppi had himself been tipped off to the verdict the day before ) .
Suggestions of dark conspiracy theories and Big Content 's machinations hung heavy in the air .
But why , exactly , are people surprised at the outcome ?
When looked at in context , the Swedish decision is n't particularly shocking , and in fact would have been far more unusual had it gone in favor of a site that trafficked widely in .torrents of illegal content , ran its own tracker , called itself " The Pirate Bay , " refused to take down links to infringing content , and posted smart - ass replies to copyright owners ' requests .
The verdict might well be altered on appeal , it might have been the result of political pressure , and it might be a very poor decision — such things will become clearer in time .
But it 's certainly not surprising .
A look back
Consider the history .
In the US , Napster was shut down even though it did not host files directly .
When services like Grokster sprang up in Napster 's wake and tried to make their services more decentralized to avoid even the appearance of control , courts still did n't accept the argument that they had clean hands .
These cases were n't decided by some local judge , either .
The Grokster case went all the way to the Supreme Court , where the seminal MGM v. Grokster decision said that sites could not avoid all liability for copyright infringement simply by arguing that they have some legal uses .
This was the famous Sony defense , from the case which legalized Betamax / VCR sales .
It survived both federal court and the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals , but the Supremes found that a Sony defense did have some limits :
One who distributes a device with the object of promoting its use to infringe copyright , as shown by clear expression or other affirmative steps taken to foster infringement , going beyond mere distribution with knowledge of third - party action , is liable for the resulting acts of infringement by third parties using the device , regardless of the device 's lawful uses ...
Nothing in Sony requires courts to ignore evidence of intent to promote infringement if such evidence exists .
It was never meant to foreclose rules of fault - based liability derived from the common law .
Where evidence goes beyond a product 's characteristics or the knowledge that it may be put to infringing uses , and shows statements or actions directed to promoting infringement , Sony 's staple - article rule will not preclude liability ...
On the record presented , respondents ' unlawful objective is unmistakable .
The classic instance of inducement is by advertisement or solicitation that broadcasts a message designed to stimulate others to commit violations .
The sort of secondary liability for infringement is also what doomed The Pirate Bay ( Swedish law has its own peculiarities , of course , but the basic concept of contributory infringement exists in both legal systems ) .
As copyright attorney Ben Sheffner put it in a blog entry Friday , " At what point will defenders of the Pirate Bay and similar sites and services realize that ' but we did n't actually host the movies and music ourselves ' is not a defense to a claim of secondary liability ( i.e. , assisting others to infringe ) ?
Napster tried that defense , as did Aimster and Grokster .
How did that work out ? "
Not just Grokster
It did n't work out well for TorrentSpy , which also made claims that it was just a normal search engine .
After repeated court rulings went against the site , including one that the site admins had deliberately destroyed evidence , it shut down in March 2008 .
Major P2P hubs like
Oink have been shuttered all over the world , and the biggest ones are currently fighting court cases of their own .
IsoHunt has mounted the " Google defense " in its own court case , telling the judge , " There are hundreds of public torrent sites , some limited to a specific subject matter , others general aggregators like is oHunt , who like Google , try to cover as much of the Internet as possible .
The essential functions performed at a torrent site are also performed at a comprehensive search site like Google or Yahoo ! "
In the wake of Grokster , though , this looks like a tough fight to win , and isoHunt has to win it in both Canada and the US ( it 's being sued in both places ) .
And Mininova , the largest BitTorrent site in the world , has a May trial date in the Netherlands to see whether it will need to proactively filter copyrighted content or whether it need only respond to individual takedown requests ( unlike The Pirate Bay , Mininova does respect such requests , though copyright holders routinely object to the burden this places on them due to constant re-uploading of content ) .
The " Whack - A - Mole " strategy that Big Content is using , one which has largely failed to stem piracy , is being replaced with an emphasis on " graduated response " or " three strikes " laws that could boot illegal file - swappers off the Internet .
But while the campaign has n't stopped piracy , it has n't lost many major cases in court , either .
It 's certainly possible to rail against dark powers and political forces — which may be present in some cases — but careful judgments like the Grokster ruling show a willingness among some of the world 's top legal thinkers to differentiate between Grokster and Google .
The fact that a Swedish court found a similar distinction between The Pirate Bay and Google may ( or may not ) be wrong , misguided , ill - informed , backwards - looking , truculent , horrible , and misshapen , but the one thing it 's not is surprising .
A Saudi inventor was recently denied a German patent for what is being described as a " killer chip " .
What is a killer chip ?
Cooler Ranch Doritos , hands down .
The basic model would consist of a tiny GPS transceiver placed in a capsule and inserted under a person 's skin , so that authorities could track him easily .
Model B would have an extra function -- a dose of cyanide to remotely kill the wearer without muss or fuss if authorities deemed he'd become a public threat .
The inventor said the chip could be used to track terrorists , criminals , fugitives , illegal immigrants , political dissidents , domestic servants and foreigners overstaying their visas .
" The invention will probably be found to violate paragraph two of the German Patent Law -- which does not allow inventions that transgress public order or good morals
If the aliens have taught us anything , it 's that the key to successful human tracking is NOT LETTING THE HUMANS KNOW .
You embed a cyanide chip under my skin and guess what -- I 'm cutting it out .
With my teeth .
Oh I 'm sorry , was that too hardcore for you ?
Yeah , well one time I ate two of my own toes because I had n't eaten dessert .
Saudi ' Killer Chip ' Implant Would Track , Eliminate Undesirables [ foxnews ]
Thanks to Dustin and philip , who track people the old fashioned way : by looking for footprints and shit .
Literally , looking for shit .

Text description provided by the architects .
Since the construction of the Palomar Observatory in 1948 , the California Institute of Technology ( Caltech ) has continuously pioneered new ways of observing and explaining the heavens .
Caltech scientists and engineers have deployed ever - changing telescopes on satellites , rockets , and balloons , and with these have made fundamental discoveries leading to new theoretical models .
Paramount discoveries that have come out of Caltech include the cosmological nature of distant quasars , gamma-ray bursts , and brown dwarfs .
In 2007 alone , Caltech astronomers found the largest object orbiting the sun since the discovery of Pluto in 1930 , as well as the most distant galaxy in the universe .
Yet , over the decades , the various specialists dispersed across the Caltech campus .
The Cahill Center for Astronomy and Astrophysics brings together a dozen different groups with vastly different cultures , focuses , and scopes into a single structure designed to facilitate collaboration and spontaneous discourse .
In the tradition of ancient and modern architectural observatories found around the world , the building itself conceptually acts as an astronomical instrument .
A vertical volume pierces the building , tilting its lens to admit light from the skies .
The result is an occupiable telescope , a public stair space that links earth and sky even as it strives to link person to person .
Located on Caltech 's South Campus directly across California Boulevard from the Institution 's historic North Campus core , the Cahill Center physically and symbolically connects the two campuses .
The new building 's scale , orientation , horizontal massing , and material language connect with the original complex of Spanish and Mediterranean buildings across California Boulevard ( a significant part of the campus 's historic core as envisioned by Bertram Goodhue 's 1917 master plan ) .
On the south side of the building , the athletic fields appear to extend all the way to the building 's edge .
A grove of newly planted sycamore trees , part of the overall landscape strategy , create a natural but permeable boundary .
The new building extends a primary north - south axis across California Boulevard , stitching the two campuses together .
A series of north - south interior corridors - literally , " stitches " - reinforce this connection and serve to orient circulation .
Floor to ceiling glazing terminates the stitches : the southern façade 's glazing overlooks Caltech 's large , open athletic fields , while the northern façade 's glazing offers views back to the historic core and to the San Gabriel Mountain Range beyond .
All of the building 's laboratories , each configured to accommodate a specific area of research or activity , are located on the basement level of the building .
By setting the building back on the site and by carefully sculpting the landscape around the building , the laboratories are granted as much access to natural light as is possible and practical , minimizing the basement feel and strengthening visual connection and accessibility to the ground level and to the campus .
The ground level of the building features a series of public spaces .
The entry lobby ( which includes the building 's central vertical circulation volume ) , the 148 - seat Hameetman auditorium , and a library maximize the building 's use as a social and gathering space .
The floor to ceiling all glass east wall of the auditorium affords views out to campus an in to the building , further promoting connectivity between the north and south campus .
The library , located adjacent to the auditorium at the southeast corner of the building , opens out onto a semi-private deck that overlooks the athletic fields .
Shaded by the sycamore grove , a deciduous tree , the deck provides an outdoor gathering space that is pleasant to use throughout the year .
The building is the result of a series of forces that collide to produce unique spaces of discovery .
Force lines track the movement of form and light through the building 's faceted façade , the central vertical volume , and the stitches .
As one moves through the space , formal fragments coalesce to reconstruct the interactions among light , architectural elements , and bodies as physical traces of the institution 's new ideas .
North Korea often test - fires missiles at times of regional tension North Korea has fired two more missiles , hours after the UN Security Council unanimously condemned its nuclear test , South Korean reports say .
The communist state fired two short - range missiles off an east - coast base , South Korea 's Yonhap news agency reported , citing an official .
The move came as UN diplomats began work on a resolution to punish North Korea for its underground nuclear test .
Diplomats said they were seeking " tough measures " , including further sanctions .
At least three missile tests accompanied Monday 's nuclear test .
Those on Tuesday involved one ground - to - ship missile and one ground - to - air missile , Yonhap said .
Your views : Should world worry ?
Reaction from around the region Media condemn nuclear tests Earlier , North Korea , in a statement carried by its official news agency KCNA , said it was clear America 's " hostile policy " towards it had not changed .
" Our army and people are fully ready for battle ... against any reckless US attempt for a pre-emptive attack , " it said in a piece criticising US moves to relocate its fighter jets .
South Korea , meanwhile , announced it would become a full member of a US - led initiative aimed at controlling trafficking in weapons of mass destruction , despite warnings from Pyongyang .
' Strong measures ' Late on Monday US President Barack Obama spoke to the leaders of both Japan and South Korea to assure them of America 's commitment to security in north - east Asia .
The conversations followed an emergency session of the UN Security Council , where members voiced strong opposition to the test and condemned it .
Russia 's UN envoy told reporters the nuclear test was a clear violation of UN Resolution 1718 .
That resolution imposed sanctions on North Korea after its first nuclear test , in October 2006 .

The US ambassador to the UN , Susan Rice , said America wanted " strong measures " when it starts work on the new resolution .
" The US thinks that this is a grave violation of international law and a threat to regional and international peace and security , " she said .
The UK's ambassador to the UN , Sir John Sawers , explained that the Council had decided to act in two stages , first issuing a statement " strongly condemning and opposing what the North Koreans have done by carrying out this second nuclear test " .
" And we decided to start work immediately on a further Security Council resolution in order to uphold the international peace and security in the region , " he added .
The question , says the BBC's Laura Trevelyan at the UN , is what kind of sanctions against North Korea can be agreed and whether they will persuade it to rejoin talks on ending its nuclear programme .
Talks abandoned On Tuesday , Asian and European foreign ministers attending the two - day biennial Asem Summit in Hanoi issued a statement condemning the test and calling for an immediate return to talks .
The issue was also expected to dominate talks between Chinese and South Korean defence ministers as they met in Beijing .

Q&A : North Korea nuclear test
What are N Korea 's motives ?
Seoul announced early on Tuesday that it would delay no longer in joining the PSI - a US - led non-proliferation campaign involving searching ships carrying suspect cargo , aimed at stopping the trafficking of weapons of mass destruction .
North Korea has repeatedly warned that the South 's participation in the PSI would be tantamount to a declaration of war .
Joining the PSI " is a natural obligation " , South Korean Foreign Minister Yu Myung - hwan said , quoted by Yonhap .
" It will help control North Korea 's development of dangerous material . "
Monday 's blast , which seismologists said had the power of a 4.5 magnitude earthquake , appears to have been much more powerful than North Korea 's first nuclear test .
Defence officials in Russia say it was an explosion of up to 20 kilotons , making it comparable to the American bombs that flattened Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 .
The test came after North Korea walked away from long - running disarmament talks .
It agreed in February 2007 to abandon its nuclear ambitions in return for aid and diplomatic concessions .
But the negotiations stalled as it accused its negotiating partners - the US , South Korea , Japan , China and Russia - of failing to meet agreed obligations .

Does the energy behind political opposition to same - sex marriage come largely from conservative political figures and religious activists who hide their inclinations behind anti-gay bluster ?
That ’s one of the most intriguing conjectures sure to be sparked by Outrage , a new documentary about the lives of closeted politicians who use their influence to oppose the advance of LGBT rights [ see trailer below ] .
The film premiered on April 24 at the Tribeca Film Festival in New York and opens in Los Angeles , San Francisco , Philadelphia , and Washington DC on Friday .
Much of the commentary surrounding Outrage will inevitably focus on outing — the practice of reporting on the private lives of supposedly straight public figures to uncover “ closeted ” homosexual activity .
That may invite the complaint that Outrage is taking a tool from the kit of tabloid journalism .
But in an interview with Reuters , filmmaker Kirby Dick suggests that his intention differs from investigative work that produces exposés on the sexual appetites of entertainers like John Travolta and Tom Cruise .
His distinction hinges on the assertion that the disingenuous and oppressive use of power , rather than homosexuality itself , is the main focus of his inquiry .
“ [ Outrage ] is not about outing gay politicians , ” Dick says .
“ It is about reporting on hypocrisy .
When a politician is in the closet and voting anti-gay with a very consistent record , he ’s acting hypocritically and I think it ’s completely appropriate for me to report on that . ”
Dick has fashioned a career as a crusader for transparency when it comes to some of the murkiest spots in American culture : where powerful institutions control the mechanisms that shape our collective understanding of sex and sexuality .
His Academy Award - nominated documentary Twist of Faith tells the story of a firefighter struggling with the aftereffects of his boyhood abuse by a Catholic priest .
In This Film Is Not Yet Rated , he examined the Motion Picture Association of America ( MPAA ) , a secretive organization whose controversial movie - rating system tends to maximize our exposure to violence while effectively censoring content that social and religious conservatives might consider transgressive .
“ Why should the most powerful media lobbying group in the country have a ratings system that ’s homophobic , that continues to perpetuate homophobia in this country ? ”
Dick told Slant magazine back in 2006 , a sentiment not far from the one that inspired Outrage .
Indeed , the filmmaker ’s justification for taking on the MPAA , the Catholic Church , and , now , closeted right - wing politicians is n’t too hard to accept .
Those who abuse power often hide their misdeeds behind a scrim of self - righteousness and moral authority ; one of journalism ’s highest callings has always been to pierce that veil of secrecy .
But if Outrage succeeds as a service to the public — particularly to us queerfolk , whose disenfranchisement seems to be one of the only things animating the Republican Party these days — it also draws our attention to one of the sharpest ironies of our religiously - inflected politics : deeply closeted gay men are often drawn to key nodes of power in the conservative movement .
From Roy Cohn and J. Edgar Hoover to Dick ’s subjects in Outrage ( including Ken Mehlman , former chairman of the RNC and manager of George W. Bush ’s 2004 reelection campaign , and Florida governor Charlie Crist , a presidential hopeful who pushed for his state ’s ban on same - sex marriage in 2008 ) , American politics produces a distinctive cohort that excels at manipulating the darker impulses of their followers , patrons and constituents precisely because their own ambitions take shape in the shadows of the closet .
It ’s not difficult to see why these two - faced demons inspire outrage in Kirby Dick and other progressive activists .
They also deserve a measure of our sympathy .
Like Ted Haggard , Jim Bakker , and their counterparts in the pulpit , closeted conservative politicians profess to guard the gates of heaven while living in their own personal hell .

Welcome !
During major humanitarian crises , 13 British charities often raise money jointly under an umbrella organisation called the Disasters Emergencies Committee ( DEC ) , with appeals shown on all the major television networks .
But the DEC had its fingers burned when the BBC and Sky decline to cooperate on its last appeal for the Gaza conflict , fearing the media 's involvement would compromise their political neutrality as news organisations , a story we reported previously on The Road .
The consequence of the BBC's Gaza decision seems to have a deeper impact then we anticipated : it was a precedent of how the media could " make or break " a humanitarian appeal effort .
The Gaza media incident spilled over into the current humanitarian catastrophes in Sri Lanka and Pakistan as now DEC is still contemplating whether or not to launch appeals for Sri Lanka and Pakistan .
" The issue is whether the broadcasters will support an appeal and my impression is that they wo n't , for perceived reasons of ( aid ) access in either case , and for perceived reasons of political complexity in either case . " ( Full )
So , let me get this straight : because the media decide not to provide coverage for an appeal , a humanitarian organisation decides NOT to launch an appeal ?
Eh ?
Would that make DEC 's decision not to appeal for Sri Lanka and Pakistan as revolting as the BBC 's decision not to provide media coverage for the appeal ?
Are soon humanitarian organisations ' picking and choosing ' which operations to support , based on ' the possible support by the media ' ?
Current balance : Humanitarian organisations ' resources already stretched because of the current economic crisis , are left close to depleted .
Not because the need was not there - Pakistan 's war in Swat Valley uprooted close to 3 million people - but because of lack of support and attention from the media .
The phenomenon is known amongst aidworkers as " The CNN Effect " :
If an emergency gets the spotlight on CNN , humanitarian wheels start rolling .
If it is not featured on CNN , the emergency is forgotten and hushed in a corner .
You might just as well not start an emergency operation if you feel you wo n't be able to fundraise for it , right ?

Imitation is the best form of flattery they say , so I suppose the now defunct Circuit City should be flattered .
While it was only two years ago we were reporting on Circuit City cutting jobs and hiring lower paid staff , it seems the last big boy on the block is doing the same .
Maybe someone should send a memo to the big wigs at Best Buy that Circuit City 's policy pretty much killed them .
CEPro is reporting that their sources have uncovered a similar plan by Best Buy .
Currently they are lowering the salaries of their highest paid workers ( specifically those with " Pro " on the name tag or those that work in their Magnolia departments ) from $ 18 an hour to closer to $ 12 .
Of course , they are saying that they will be offered other positions but you can bet they wo n't be offered similar pay .
Those positions will be just as low paying as the one they 'll be leaving .
If you can't make a living at your old position with the new pay , how will a title change really make any difference ?
Best Buy acquired Magnolia back in 2000 with the commitment to turn it into its own national chain .
That slowly changed as Magnolia stores were opened then closed with Magnolia mini-stores being placed inside of Best Buys .
Now , we may be seeing the death of the Magnolia employee and with that death , a trend toward lower waged and inexperienced personnel .
This is obviously a function of the economy where consumable income is being diverted more and more to necessities .
But one must question the logic of following such a failed model .
Circuit City 's cuts were much deeper ( seemingly , we do n't exactly know how deep the Best Buy knife is cutting yet ) and much more abrupt - they cut the people and then offered to hire them back at a reduced salary .
Best Buy seems to be taking the Office Space approach and just " letting it work out " on its own .
They reduce people 's pay and they put up their hands claiming it is n't their fault that they do n't have any experienced people any more .
Best Buy needs to remember that when Circuit City made their 3500 person cut , they were the number 2 electronics retailer in the US .
If they think they will be immune to the ultimate fate that has befallen Circuit City and Tweeter , they are sadly mistaken .
One thing they need to do is look in their rear view mirror .
Currently , BJ's Wholesales Club ( a Costco / Sam's Club type store ) is now offering installation services of big screen TVs .
This is unprecedented on a number of levels .
First , it is a wholesale club that is offering service - something that usually comes in the form of jumping out of the way before they run you over with their forklift .
Second , it may signify a move away from the last of the Big Box stores and toward the wholesale arena .
If Best Buy is n't offering any service that you can't get at a wholesale club , then what 's the point of going ?
Before , you could at least count of talking to a " knowledgeable " staff member at Circuit City or Best Buy .
But once they are gone , what has Best Buy got on the wholesale stores ?
Installation services .
Once that 's gone there is practically no reason to go there other than typically a larger selection of products .
On the other hand , the Wharton School surmised that the fall of Tweeter was based on an overemphasis of service over price .
Best Buy , they said , " should avoid the temptation to cut prices at the expense of quality sales and service " or essentially risk turning into a Walmart .
Walmart already has the edge in price , what they do n't have is knowledgeable service staff .
If the knowledgeable Best Buy staff leave because of the lower wages , what is the draw for the average consumer that is looking for help in making a substantial purchase ?
Why would they buy from a high school kid in a Best Buy blue polo when they can buy from a high school kid in a Walmart blue polo ?
Especially when you consider they are already at Walmart for just about every other purchase , this thinning of the knowledgeable Best Buy staff looks to be a huge misstep in strategy .
So what can we expect in the news from Best Buy .
Well , if we go by the Circuit City model we 'll see lower morale leading to slow sales .
Slow sales will lead to lower profits which will lead to the circling of sharks .
Someone may make a big for the former Big Box giant or not - but at least there will be talk of it .
You can expect more than likely at least one possibly more stepping down of CEOs .
Eventually , if someone does n't scoop up the brand for pennies on the dollar and turn them around , you 'll hear about massive store closings and layoff which will be greeted by rumors ( hotly denied ) of impending bankruptcy .
A few months later ( after a sluggish holiday season ) and those rumors will be confirmed .
And what will we be left with ?
Wholesale stores or Walmart .
Now there 's a depressing thought .

The Financial Crisis is Not a Black Swan Event
I have become increasingly concerned that some in the Obama administration are treating this economic crisis as a Black Swan event .
Nassim Nicholas
Taleb coined the term to describe an event that is very rare , random and unpredictable .
The imporant thing about Black Swans is that , because they are random and unpredictable , you ca n’t stop them from happening ; you can only create your systems able to handle Black Swans if they occur .
For example , a flu pandemic that kills tens of millions might be a Black Swan , and it ’s one that we ’re completely unprepared for , as we do n’t have the excess medical capacity to handle it .
The most recent event which made me think of Black Swans is the news thatnew SEC Chair Mary Schapiro does n’t plan on reforming ratings agencies .
Now , ratings agencies were one of the key actors in this mess — they certified mortgage backed securities and other toxic derivatives as AAA quality .
If they had not done so , almost no one would have bought them .
The ratings agencies are paid by the companies whose securities they rate .
I trust you see the problem .
If you think that the current economic crisis is just random , a once in a century disaster ( or at least once every few decades ) , then you wo n’t think making major changes is necessary .
Get through the problem , go back to how you were doing things before , and everything will be fine .
But , of course , the economic and financial crisis unfolding right now was not random .
This crisis was predicted by multiple people , and it was predicted because of policy steps taken by government and widely - known private actions .
We could all read the charts showing a bubble in housing prices and sales .
We could all see that derivatives were also in a bubble .
We knew that leverage was out of control , ballooning to 30X or in many cases even higher numbers .
We knew that with financial deregulation firms had started being involved in multiple types of businesses , putting retail banks at risk from their insurance or brokerage or investment banking arms .
We all knew that the US savings rate had hit unsustainable lows and that the trade deficit was too high .
We knew that the carry trade was introducing tons of hot money to the system ( borrowing for nothing in Japan and using that money for leveraged plays elsewhere ) .
And , perhaps most importantly , we should have known that executives in the financial sector paying themselves huge bonuses were concentrating on short term gains and did not care about long term viability of their companies or even care about the honesty of what they were doing , because hey , by the time it all fell apart , they ’d be rich , rich , rich and never need to work again .
All of which is to say the crisis was caused by a number of factors .
It was not random .
It was predictable and predicted .
If we just muddle through this current meltdown — spend a lot of money bailing out the banks , throw some stimulus around — and do n’t fix the fundamentally - flawed incentives and structures of the system , it will likely happen again .
Alas , Mary Schapiro ’s actions imply that there was nothing really fundamentally wrong with how business was done .
At the very least , the US needs to make the following changes :
Reduce executive compensation — significantly ,
Bring all securities under regulation ( i.e. Credit Default Swaps must be regulated as insurance including reserve requirements and the necessity to use government approved actuarial charts ) ,
Reduce overall leverage to 10X for everyone ,
Break financial companies back into functional firms ( i.e. break brokerages and insurance companies and investment banks off of retail banks ) ,
Disallow financial innovation which is not expressly approved by regulators and is not then fully regulated ,
Fix its trade imbalances ,
Fix its savings rate ,
Move off of the oil economy ,
Ensure that lending is done responsibly and at relatively low markups from the Fed Funds rate , and
Enact anti-usury laws .
If these changes are n’t made , then you can bet dollars to the donuts that a financial crisis will happen again in some form .
This crisis is a structural problem , not a random mess caused by bad luck .

MEXICO CITY ( Reuters ) - Mexico ’s most wanted man Joaquin “ Shorty ” Guzman , blamed for thousands of deaths in a drug war , has made it onto the Forbes Magazine list of the world ’s richest people with an estimated $ 1 billion fortune .
Guzman , who is just 5 feet tall , escaped from prison in 2001 to set off a wave of killings across Mexico in an attempt to dominate the country ’s highly lucrative drug trade into the United States .
“ He is not available for interviews , ” Luisa Kroll , senior editor of Forbes , said Wednesday .
“ But his financial situation is doing quite well . ”
Forbes placed Guzman at 701 on its list , tied with dozens of others worldwide with riches of some $ 1 billion .
Guzman , 51 , who officials believe changes his cell phone every day to avoid being tracked , is often compared to the late Colombian kingpin Pablo Escobar , whom Forbes has said amassed a fortune of $ 3 billion before he was killed by police in 1993 .
The Mexican smuggler is “ basically one of the biggest providers of cocaine to the United States , ” Kroll said .
The magazine based its tally of his fortune on estimates from drug - trade analysts and U.S. government data .
Guzman ’s prison escape and ability to elude capture for eight years are an embarrassment to the Mexican government .
He has outwitted four major government drives to find him between 2002 and 2007 .
His escapades are the stuff of legend in the areas he controls and in popular “ narcocorrido ” songs that glorify drug traffickers .
Mexico ’s attorney general , Eduardo Medina Mora , told Reuters last week that defeating Guzman ’s cartel of traffickers from the Pacific state of Sinaloa was a priority in President Felipe Calderon ’s army - backed drug fight .
Some 7,000 people have been killed in drug violence across Mexico since the start of last year as rival gangs fight each other and Mexican security forces .
Guzman ’s enforcers from the Sinaloa cartel are among the most vicious hitmen .
Forbes said Mexican and Colombian traffickers laundered between $ 18 billion and $ 39 billion in proceeds from wholesale drugs shipments to the United States in 2008 .
Guzman and his operation likely grossed 20 percent of that -- enough for him to have pocketed $ 1 billion over his career and earn a spot on the billionaire ’s list for the first time .
About 90 percent of all cocaine consumed in the United States comes through Mexico .
It also is a major source of heroin , methamphetamines and marijuana in the United States .
Some grid hosting customers of Media Temple have been offline for more than a day due to a recurrence of problems with its storage systems that caused a 38 - hour outage earlier this year .
Sites hosted on Cluster.02 of Media Temple 's Grid-Service platform went down Monday afternoon at about 4:15 p.m , which the Los Angeles hosting company attributed to file corruption issues in a storage system .
The problems are only affecting customers of its grid hosting service , and not those using MT for shared hosting .
On Tuesday afternoon , Media Temple said 1,800 customers remained offline , and the company apparently is having differences with storage vendor about the best restoration options and the prospect of additional downtime .
Media Temple said the problems were similar to those that crashed Cluster.02 for nearly two days in early March .
At the time , Media Temple blamed the problems on its legacy " first generation " storage system from Bluearc and announced plans to transition its grid hosting service to a new " second generation " system .
Two months later , the migration is still not complete .
" This System Incident is taking place on a cluster using our 1st - generation storage architecture , " Media Temple said on its status page .
" While we have made significant progress transitioning this cluster to gen 2 storage ... there are still components that rely heavily on the gen 1 technology . "
Media Temple initially promised a new internally - developed storage system for Grid-Service following an outage in December 2007 .
Media
Temple said that some customer sites were returned to service early Tuesday morning , but others remained offline pending a lengthy file check of a storage subsystem .
As of 11 a.m. Pacific time Wednesday , Media Temple said the process was nearly complete , but still had no firm ETA for when service would be restored .
UPDATE : As of 4 p.m. Pacific on Tuesday , Media Temple says 1,800 sites remain offline .
" Our storage vendor has recommended a full file system check on Segment.01 , amounting to an additional estimated 48 hours of downtime for those 1800 users , " MT writes in its latest update .
" This is not acceptable to us .
Our engineers are already in the process of restoring all Segment.01 sites from our backup servers .
... he vendor - recommended repair action will be completed in tandem to prevent data loss .
When it is complete we will then merge the repaired data to bring all data current . "
As was the case in the March downtime , the outage is being discussed on Twitter and customer blogs .
Media Temple is communicating with customers via its system status blog and Twitter account .
PRAGUE 
The former prime minister of Kosovo , Agim Ceku , a former rebel commander wanted in Serbia on war crimes charges , has been arrested in Bulgaria , Bulgarian officials announced Wednesday .
The Bulgarian Interior Ministry said Mr. Ceku had been detained based on an Interpol arrest warrant initiated by Serbia as he crossed the border from Macedonia on Tuesday .
Kamen Mihov , a Bulgarian prosecutor in charge of international legal issues , said a court would decide by Friday whether to extend Mr. Ceku ’s detention by 40 days  during which he could be extradited to Serbia  or to release him .
Serbia has accused Mr. Ceku of committing war crimes during the 1998 - 99 war in Kosovo , when he was a commander of the Kosovo Liberation Army , a rebel group that used guerrilla tactics to fight against Serbia ’s rule of Kosovo .
The Serbian Justice Ministry said Mr. Ceku had been indicted in Serbia on charges of “ command responsibility ” in relation to what it called the illegal deaths of 669 Serbs and 18 other non-Albanians in 1999 .
He has strenuously denied the accusations .
Kosovo declared independence from Serbia in 2008 .
But Serbia , which regards Kosovo as its medieval heartland and is supported by Russia , has refused to recognize it as a country .

What am I doing right now ?
If you must know , I ’m staring at the computer screen , toggling between this column and my e-mail program , my online bank balance and photos of my dog .
Oh wait , that was a few seconds ago .
Now I ’m hungry .
Now I ’m realizing I have no bread for toast .
Now an hour has passed since I started this paragraph .
Do you find this interesting ?
Me neither .
But the Age of Oversharing is upon us , and those of us who lack enthusiasm for minutia are in a distinct minority .
The current enabler - in - chief of this movement ?
Twitter , that suddenly ubiquitous “ microblogging ” system that lets users post updates of 140 characters or less that answer the question “ what are you doing now ” ?
Most people still are n’t quite sure what Twitter is -- with only 14 million users , it ’s no Facebook yet -- but it ’s insinuated itself into the popular lexicon so vigorously that just about everyone seems to have at least heard of it and its infinitive , “ to tweet ” ( when you use Twitter , technically you are tweeting . )
This is due in large part to a rather sudden media embrace .
Last month , both the Doonesbury comic strip and “ The Daily Show ” poked fun at Twitter and its users , which now include a number of members of Congress ( Jon Stewart scolded them for tweeting during hearings ) .
Last week , election protesters in the nation of Moldova were reportedly aided and galvanized by the play - by - play rally updates afforded by Twitter .
And over the weekend , when Amazon.com experienced a “ glitch ” -- Amazon ’s word -- that caused tens of thousands of gay - related books to be de-ranked on the site , the Twitter outcry went viral so effectively that the company is now experiencing a major public relations crisis .
Advertisement
Meanwhile , many news outlets , ever desperate to attract even a passing glance from tech - obsessed , attention - impaired youngsters , are now tweeting about breaking news ( as well as less - than - breaking , not - necessarily news ) with the same vigor they bring to reporting .
This week , CNN ’s Breaking News Twitter account ( then the most popular account , according to the tracking site Twitterholic ) was inching toward a record - making 1 million followers ( “ followers ” are the people who actually read your posts ) .
This was apparently so exciting and dramatic that Ashton Kutcher , whose account was ranked third , challenged CNN to see who could be the first to reach that 1 million mark .
Guess who won .
Incidentally , the account of Kutcher ’s wife , Demi Moore , is now ranked 15th .
Other popular tweeters include Britney Spears at No. 2 , Barack Obama at No. 6 and Whole Foods Market at No. 24 .
That ’s right , nearly 425,000 people have signed up for updates that , presumably , let them know what a $ 21 jar of olive oil is doing right now .
Look , some of my best friends are tweeting .
I know this because their e-mails now have signatures listing their Twitter account names along with their cellphone numbers , website urls and notices that the message has been sent from a hand - held device ( as if that ’s not obvious because they typed “ sluts met 4 lunge ” instead of “ let ’s meet for lunch . ” )
But at the risk of unilaterally offending 14 million people , I need to say this :
If Twitter were a person , it would be an emotionally unstable person .
It would be that person we avoid at parties and whose calls we do n’t pick up .
It would be the person whose willingness to confide in us at first seems intriguing and flattering but eventually makes us feel kind of gross because the friendship is unearned and the confidence is unjustified .
The human incarnation of Twitter , in other words , is the person we all feel sorry for , the person we suspect might be a bit mentally ill , the tragic oversharer .
Advertisement
Of course , privacy as a cultural or even personal value has been going out of style for some time now ; in a world without boundaries , Twitter alone cannot be blamed for making spewing into a sport .
And , to be fair , its initial function was to serve as an information conduit between close friends and family , the idea being that even if the whole world did n’t care that you were buying frozen peas right now , your mother ( God help her ) still might .
But as Twitter ’s popularity wobbles at the tipping point between faddish distraction and worldwide obsession , it ’s worth wondering how much of this “ connecting ” is simply hastening the erosion of our already compromised interpersonal skills .
Are we tweeting because we truly want to communicate with a select group of true friends , or because typing has replaced talking and indiscretion has been stripped of all negative connotations ?
Are most Twitter posts merely inane , or do they carry the faint whiff of the insane ?
The jury ’s still out .
But , along with “ what am I doing right now ? ” maybe it ’s time to ask “ what the hell are we doing ” ?

Those waiting anxiously for the next version of Windows now have a date to anticipate .
Microsoft has confirmed that Windows 7 will be launched on October 22 , 2009 .
This date , which is referred to as General Availability ( GA ) , is in line with Microsoft 's previous statement saying that it would have Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008 R2 ready by the holidays .
After the software giant unleashed the official Release Candidate on May 5 , it became apparent that development on the follow - up to Vista was close to wrapping up .
Microsoft senior VP Bill Veghte revealed the company 's launch plans in an interview Tuesday morning .
" The feedback from the release candidate has been good , " Veghte told CNET .
Furthermore , the RTM ( Release to Manufacturing ) build is expected to be made available to Microsoft partners in the last two weeks of July , according to Channel 10 .
The Windows 7 launch will come just shy of three years after Vista development wrapped up and the OS was released to OEMs .
( Boxed copies of Vista hit store shelves on January 30 , 2007 . )
The timing is good for Microsoft , as it will come well in advance of the annual holiday shopping frenzy , even though the late - October release means that the company will miss out on back - to - school sales .
Windows 7 will come in six flavors : Starter , Home Basic , Home Premium , Professional , Ultimate , and Enterprise .
The lineup is an improvement over Vista , as it's apparent that Microsoft has taken to heart the criticism it faced over the Vista versioning system .
Microsoft has yet to make any announcements on pricing .
Update
Via the Windows Server Division WebLog , Microsoft has confirmed that Windows Server 2008 R2 will be arriving at the same time as Windows 7 : " Windows Server 2008 R2 RTM code is on track to be available to our partners sometime in the 2nd half of July .
Windows Server 2008 R2 will also be broadly available about the same time as the Windows 7 GA date of Oct 22 . "

Surprise surprise
Wenger gets the tactics wrong YET again as we are humiliated again .
1st off ,
Why did we play 4 - 5 - 1 again when its does n’t work for us ?
And IF you are going to play 4 - 5 - 1 Mr Wenger may i suggest a big powerful striker to lead the line vs Terry and Alex rather then RVP ?
in recent games we have let in 4 goals vs Liverpool , 3 vs ManUtd and now 4 again vs Chelsea .
ALL playing 4 - 5 - 1 and ALL with Song ( Our defensive ROCK !! ) .
But Wenger knows best !
Who are we to question the great Wenger ?
The man who can turn blood into red wine .
The man who can walk on water .
Every time we say something about the great Wenger we are called plastics and told to go and support Man Utd , So i hope the “ in wenger we trust brigade ” sleep well tonight known you are as much to blame for our worst run of winning a mayor trophy for 20 years , you bunch of clueless muppet’s .
I think Arsenal have the thickest fans in the world as they cant see whats really going on and are still dreaming that wenger will lead us into glory with this magnificent bunch of kids with the amazing spirit and mental strength .
And of course wenger you do n’t need to spend in the summer .
This bunch of players are just fine …
And of course next season we will have Rosicky back who will be like a new signing .
You are a joke wenger , And the fans who support you are are joke .
I trust the wenger clan will now attack me ( YAWN )
But you know what they say , The truth hurts .
WENGER OUT … and he cant take the thick Arsenal fans with him …
Enjoy my video to the the great wenger LINK

SINBAD
Shredder and Donatello had a special relationship .
unique
Most of the episodes followed a fairly standard formula : first the turtles eat some pizza , while making tired jokes , then Shredder , Krang , or some other third rate hack of - a - villain hatches a ridiculous plan , which the turtles eventually foil in a poorly animated fight scene .
There is one episode that stands out though : Shredderville .
The premise is a pretty standard
It ’s a Wonderful Life style tale , and although dozens of shows have done the same , this one is prettybizarre .
The episode begins as the turtles return to the sewer , after once again besting , but failing to capture Shredder .
While wallowing in self - pity , the turtles begin to question their endless struggle and wonder if the world might be better off without them .
The next morning , the turtles awaken to a world where Shredder is the undisputed lord and master and New York has been appropriately renamed Shredderville .
With Splinter gone , the turtles try to seek out April O’Neil and Irma ( yeah , we did n’t remember her either , but apparently she ’s April ’s best friend ) .
The turtles arrive at Channel 6 headquarters only to find that in this reality , April and Irma are both slaves in Bebop and Rocksteady ’s harem .
We have to say that for a children 's cartoon , this seems a little racy .
No TMNT episode is complete without the turtles putting on some ridiculous costumes .
Krang is useless without the robotic body of balding fat man in red underpants
As the turtles continue to wander the city , they discover that the world is a dismal place without them .
Under Shredder ’s rule unemployment has skyrocketed and the city has been reduced to a crumbling wasteland .
None of this is really that unique — the alternate Sunnydale sans Buffy reality in the Buffy the Vampire Slayer episode The Wish was a wasteland too , though a scarier vampire filled one .
What really makes this episode different is how Krang and Shredder are depicted .
The turtles , believing that Krang is behind this new reality , go to visit him at the Technodrome — which now sits as a rusting war relic in the middle of Central Park .
But when they meet Krang , instead of finding their formidable foe , they find a pathetic bureaucrat who ’s more concerned with fixing his monitor so he can finish his paperwork than stopping the Technodrome from overheating .
If anything , Shredder is even worse off than Krang .
When the turtles visit him at his headquarters at Channel 6 ( why his headquarters is there is beyond us ) , he ’s just as miserable and pathetic — though in this reality he wears a business suit , while still sporting his trademark helmet ( after all , an evil emperor needs to be both terrifying and stylish ) .
With the Technodrome only minutes away from an explosion , Donatello demands that Shredder divert coolant to stop the reaction .
Oh Shredder , how the hell did you ever become a ninja ?
“ I ’ve only got two hands , ” whines Shredder in response .
“ Look at all these repair requests , everything is broken .
You think being emperor of the world is easy ; oh it ’s giving me an ulcer .
”
“ Oh Great , ” sighs Donatello .
“ We want to get back to our world ; where you do n’t rule .
” “ A world where I do n’t rule , ” pleads Shredder .
“ Take me with you , please .
” Wow .
Poor Shredder , he finally gets what he wants , complete and total dominion over the earth , and it ’s too much paperwork for him to handle .
Seriously though , the episode , despite its lame jokes and ridiculous turtle disguises ( how is anyone fooled by a trench coat and a hat , they still have green faces ) , is actually pretty interesting .
The story follows the standard It ’s a Wonderful Life premise , but turns it on its head by showing how pathetic the lives of villains are without the heroes .
Of course in the end , the turtles wake up safe and sound in the sewer , but we all knew that was going to happen from the start .
If you so desire , you can check out the episode in its entirety on YouTube All images come from the TMNT episode Shredderville .

President Obama is expected to announce late this week his decision to create a senior White House official responsible for protecting the nation 's government - run and private computer networks from attack , according to a published report .
The " cyber czar " will probably be a member of the National Security Council but will report to the national security adviser and the senior White House economic advisor , according to The Washington Post , which cited unnamed officials who had been briefed on the plan .
As of Friday , Obama had not yet settled on the advisor 's rank and title .
The announcement is to coincide with the release of a 40 - page report evaluating the government 's strategy for security government networks and other infrastructure deemed critical to national security .
The timing of the report - it was expected to be released a week or two ago - and the details included in the Washington Post report suggest the plan may have run into infighting by advisors to Obama .
On his first full day in office , Obama signaled a willingness to have the cyber czar report directly to the president , an arrangement that he promised as a candidate and that was also recommended by a panel of more than 60 government and business computer security experts .
While the idea is whoever is appointed will be someone who can " pick up the phone and contact the president directly , if need be , " the advisor no longer would report directly to Obama , according to the report .
What 's more , the czar would now have two bosses , in an attempt to strike a balance between homeland security and economic concerns .
Over the past few months , turf wars have arisen between advisors who want the ultra-secretive National Security Agency to oversee the country 's cybersecurity .
Others have said the job is best carried out by the National Cybersecurity Center , an office within the Department of Homeland Security that 's responsible for coordinating the defense of civilian , military and intelligence networks .
In March , the government 's cybersecurity chief abruptly resigned amid allegations his office was woefully underfunded and inappropriately controlled by the military .
The plan for the czar to report to a senior economic advisor appears to be an effort to give Senior White House Economic Advisor Lawrence H. Summers a degree of control in ensuring efforts to protect private networks do n't unduly threaten economic growth . ®
Rodica pointed me at this article on why requirements stink on ice from the Forrester blog , which asks the question , why are n’t we using social media in helping to sort out what customers want , instead of relying solely on customer interviews and other old school approaches .
My answer ?
This is the wrong question .
Data collection is not the big problem .
Sure , forums and blogs can be handy , but rarely is finding better data the big challenge .
Requirements suck for two major reasons .
1. Requirements is not Design .
Here ’s a requirements list :
Make a $ 5 car that goes 500 miles per hour , weighs 10 lbs , and is invisible .
Those are very clear requirements .
They ’re also impossible .
No matter how well defined these requirements are , or how happy the customer and the VP is with them , the project is set up to fail .
How can you know if your requirements are BS ?
You probably can’t .
Requirements are not a product .
The product is the product .
A requirement is best seen as a way to help the design / engineering team succeed in making the product .
End of story .
The design / engineering team is the true customer of a requirements document .
They know first hand all the stupid things requirements often include since they ’ve been forced to experience them before .
Want to avoid these stupid mistakes ?
Get their input early .
The easy test for how much a requirements document sucks or rocks is what the people who have to use it to do their own work think of it .
If they think it sucks , they ’re right .
Â
This means anyone charged with requirements should , from day one , be collaborating with the designers and engineers in defining the requirements .
Incorporating their ideas , their feedback , and convincing them of new perspectives they need to understand .
If they think requirement # 21 is stupid , and they are wrong , at a minimum , it ’s Mr. Requirement ’s job to invest the time to convince them otherwise .
I do n’t want an engineer working on something s/he thinks is stupid .
How I can expect them to do good work on something they find stupid ?
I could n’t do good work that way .
Â
So I ca n’t expect them to either .
However , if you throw a requirement over the wall , which is what most requirements document authors pridefully do , it ’s about as likely to succeed as throwing a hand grenade – people will scream and run .
Â
But if instead the requirements document is something they feel they contributed do , that it ’s in part their document , they ’ll run towards it , love it , and work hard to make it real .
Bingo .
2 . Too many cooks .
Requirements processes are long and stupid only because authority is spread out too thin across the organization .
Talk to any person that is self employed , like your plumber , your gardener , or even your hair stylist .
They do requirements gathering with their customers all the time , for important and expensive things , without 20 page documents , committee meetings or therapy bills .
How is this possible !?
What magic do they know that has yet to hit the business world ?
It ’s simple .
They have requirements authority .
They have the power to make decisions .
Your requirements process sucks not because you do n’t have the right forms , or because you ’re not following the right process , it ’s because you have too many people involved , all pretending to be effective with a tiny , minuscule piece of the requirements pie .
Pick one person per major area , a person who gets that requirements are part of design and not the other way around , a person who sees the value of collaboration and input , but is confident enough to make unpopular decisions when they are in the best interest , and give them the authority to drive requirements .
I guarantee quality will rise sharply by picking the right person and giving them more authority .
Fewer cooks .
It ’s a simple way to solve many problems , but oh so rare to see .
The one book anyone working on requirements needs to read is Exploring Requirements by Gerald Weinberg .
It points out most of the stupidity that goes on , explains avoidance tactics , and clearly expresses how requirements are part of the design process – that good problem solving techniques can quickly make your requirements documents better than ever .
Weigers Software Requirements has an excellent reputation , but I ’m not as familiar with it as Weinberg ’s book .
And Chapters 3 thru 7 of my book Making things happen offers one way to get from ideas all the way to specs .
There are tons of other ways of course , but if you want my general take on this for large teams , it ’s in there .
And Getting Real , by the folks at 37 signals , is a book that puts simplicity first , advocating almost no formal documents , requirements lists or specs at all .
The Mind Virus Ideas behaving in society like viruses in the body An essay in hypertext by Scott Bidstrup " The voice which I heard out of the sky , I heard it again speaking to me , saying : Go , take the open book - roll in the hand of the angel who stands upon the sea and the land .
I went toward the angel , bidding him to give me the book .
And he said to me :
Take it and eat it , and it will make your stomach bitter , but in your mouth , it will be sweet as honey .
And I took the book from the hand of the angel and ate it , and in my mouth it was like sweet honey ; and when I had eaten it , my stomach was bitter "
-- Revelation 10:9 -10 Richmond Lattimore Translation
T he epigraph above , taken from the Richmond Lattimore translation of the Book of Revelation in the New Testament , is an excellent analogy to the effects that a major meme complex can have on the soul .
What is a meme ?
A meme is an idea that behaves in society like a virus does in a body .
They 're all around us .
Political or sexual jokes , for example , can behave like memes , they start with one person , are retold time and again , and end up travelling around the world , as they 're told and retold , and in so doing , they behave like viruses .
They infect ( the joke is told to the ' host ' ) , they reproduce ( are retold by the ' host ' where they ' infect ' new ' hosts , ' etc. ) , they mutate ( are told in variations that arise in the retelling ) , and they can even have vectors ( books and magazines , for example ) .
Like viruses , memes can be benign like many physical viruses , or they can be pathological , producing illness , just as do many physical viruses .
Like physical viruses , they can be only modestly infective , or they can be highly virulent .
They can control behavior , just as physical viruses can , and they can even direct physical evolution , as explained by the recent article on them in Scientific American ( see The Power of Memes , by Susan Blackmore in the October 2000 issue , page 64 ) .
The whole range of behaviors that are seen in physical viruses can be seen to have analogies in memes .
This essay is the story of the most successful meme complex of all time , how it infects , why it is virulent , and the effects it has had on culture and society .
We 'll start by saying that the meme we are going to study is actually a complex of memes , hundreds of them , which have been packaged together and infect their hosts together .
Some of the memes in this complex even prepare the host for the entry and infection of other memes in the complex , being extinquished themselves in the process .
The intricacy of the meme complex in our example is truly remarkable in its evolutionary success , its extreme virulence and infectivity , and the wide range of behaviors it controls .
The reason this meme complex has been so successful is that it has evolved a remarkably precise insight into human nature .
The meme complex has mutated and evolved through the centuries , creating a meme complex that is highly effective , because it " pushes all the right buttons " and is successful at reproducing and spreading because it very artfully and skillfully alters behavior .
This meme complex is one in a major category of memes , studied by the science of memetics , and that category is religion .
The specific meme complex we are going to study is that of Christianity , and its principal vector , the Bible , specifically the New Testament .
The origins of the bible is discussed extensively elsewhere at this site , and wo n't be discussed here .
What this essay is intended to explain is why the New Testament says what it does , how it was designed , both initially and through evolutionary change , to be an infective meme complex , and to explain the subterfuge that was included to defend the meme complex from external " immune " attack .
The Bible , as we all know , consists of two main parts , the Old and New Testaments .
The Old Testament is primarily a collection of laws and myths for Hebraic Judaism , having been passed down as part of an effort to maintain Judaism as a distinct religion and culture .
The New Testament , however , was designed from the outset to establish a new branch of Judaism known as Christianity .
Why the new branch ?
Many scholars who have studied this question have said that it was because of the Roman destruction of the Second Temple at the end of the Jewish revolt of 67 - 70 C.E. , and the attempts to quash Judaism that were the result of the rebellion .
These scholars maintain that Christianity was really an attempt to re-order Judaism both as a culture and a religion to make it easier to accept , make it propagate itself into non-Jewish populations , and defend it against the assault of Roman suppression .
The Jewish intelligentsia that crafted this new strain of the Jewish meme complex , led by Peter and Paul , were successful beyond their wildest dreams .
What they created was a meme complex that has evolved not to preserve Judaism in the form they were seeking to preserve it , but it has evolved to be a meme complex that survived for two thousand years and has spread to one person in three on the entire earth , more people than were even alive than when the original meme complex was crafted .
What accounts for the wild success of this meme complex ?
As stated before , the original crafters of this meme complex started with a few insightful understandings of human nature .
With these insightful understandings , the crafters then set about quite deliberately to create a mind virus that would infect others with their ideas about what Judaism in the post - temple era should be , how the believers should behave in order to best spread the infection , and using a few techniques to maintain an immunity from ideas that would threaten the infection .
While the original meme was only modestly successful , it was sufficiently successful to survive and it evolved slowly but brilliantly , eventually acquiring new insights and new control and immunity mechanisms , eventually becoming one of the most successful meme complexes in all of human history .
Let us begin by examining the dichotomous problems of human nature which the meme complex has evolved exploit .
Free will versus Determinism .
The New Testament writers and editors resolve this dichotomy firmly on the side of free will .
Without free will , mankind would not be capable of moral decisions that could consign it to hell .
If mankind cannot make such decisions , he has no need for a bible , a salvation and a rescue .
Mankind is presumed to have good intentions , but with the incapacity ( without Christianity ) to carry them out .

Mankind is presumed to have good intentions , but with the incapacity ( without Christianity ) to carry them out .
Good versus Evil .
Whether man is inherently good , is answered in the New Testament strongly in the negative .
Again , the reason is to afford the opportunity for man to be ' saved ' from his inherent evil .
A man who is inherently good has no need to be saved , because he has no proclivity to evil .

Heredity versus Enviroment .
The meme complex could not allow this dichotomy to distract from the question of moral reformation , so it quickly evolved to veer off into questions of the fragmentation of the human experience , of being ' saved ' or not being ' saved , ' and questions of life after death .
The meme complex could not allow this dichotomy to distract from the question of moral reformation , so it quickly evolved to veer off into questions of the fragmentation of the human experience , of being ' saved ' or not being ' saved , ' and questions of life after death .
The Mind versus Body problem is anticipated by Biblical authors and editors , and their answer to it has evolved to the point where it transcends psychology right up to the 21st century in that it declares that the awareness of mind in a body is an artifact of the one - sidedness of consciousness , with an unconsciousness underlying the reality that is alien to the mind itself .
The meme complex recognizes the threat posed by an exploration of that reality , and it answers that problem by holding that the underlying reality is a place of threat and menace , and not a place to be explored .
These prescriptions became the basis of Christian doctrine .
They form a framework around which the rest of the meme complex is built .
In our virus analogy , these interpretations on the insights described above are analogous to the DNA , the genes , that prescribe how the doctrines are to be controlled , so as to become and remain maximally virulent .
Hiding the Pathology : Weak Mind Games but Strong Synergy
Yet they 're powerful .
They 're as effective as if they were overt , because each mind game is carefully designed to work together with other weak , subtle mind games to synergize into a powerful , influential and self - reinforcing whole .
Synergy , then , is the key to understanding the mind games of the New Testament .
So what are the mind games that are working together to subvert the minds of the potential believer ?
And what are the indicators for each of these mind games ?
The indicators are sometimes , but not always obvious .
Often , they can only be understood in the context of their synergy with other mind games .
This is why they are not well studied .
I present them here in the order of their importance and obviousness .
Expressing the Genes : Infectivity Through Synergized Mind Games
The success of any religious system is in inverse proportion to the sincerity of the founding prophet .
-- Edmund Cohen , " Mind of the Bible Believer "
The second mind game is to not allow understandings of experience to be modified by subsequent learning and experience .
This is the primary defense against a reinterpretation of the conversion experience as not being spiritual after all .
Once one has the fantastic religious experience , this mind game keeps that one going , and prevents it from being overturned by subsequent learning .
This is a mind game that we all play , and it is an important part of learning .
But it is one that is hijacked by the meme complex of Christianity to reinforce the fantastic conversion experience and not allow it to be reexamined .
The way this mind game is played is by discrediting " the world . "
We have all seen evangelicals who have been so caught up in the experience that they literally ignore contrary evidence .
Of course this is encouraged , and specific instructions are given throughout the New Testament for dealing with contrary evidence presented by unbelievers .
This mind game , of course , short - circuits the intellectual life - cycle of learning that is an important part of mental health .
The mind which is excluded from subsequent learning modification cannot , in the long run , maintain mental health , and as a consequence , this mind game loses its power if not for the synergy of its interaction with other mind games .
The meme complex deals with this by allowing subsequent learning modification with only approved doctrines and dogma .
The third mind game is verbicide
It is , quite literally , distorting , even destroying the meaning of words so that they have a different meaning to the believer than the non-believer .
By giving the believer an understanding of the meaning of words that the authors intend , rather than the generally understood meanings , the general impression of a religious experience ( the first mind game ) is reinforced .
The believer is led to understand the a " hidden meaning " has been " revealed " by the " holy spirit . "
The New Testament is riddled with such double meanings .
When one understands the hidden meanings , the phrase often has a meaning radically different than the one understood by a causual reader .
Examples of words with hidden meanings :
Word Casual Meaning Meaning to Believer Life a state of non-death ; being aware being in a state of spiritual sensitivity arising out of the state of belief ; being saved ; being in a state of salvation ( depending on context ) death a state of not being alive ; the endpoint of living Not being spiritually sensitive ; not being saved ; not being in a state of salvation ( depending on context ) truth
That which is real , verifiable , reality apart from human understanding
That which is revealed by the Holy Spirit wisdom Understandings that are shown to be correct the doctrines of the " Gospel " as revealed by the " holy spirit "
When one fully understands the meanings of these words as used in code to the believer , one can then go back and read the words of the New Testament and understand the intended code meaning .
As one does so , it becomes apparent how the verbiage means one thing to the casual reader and something quite different to the true believer .
But what really stands out , when you examine it dispassionately , is how the new , hidden meaning is calculated to influence behavior .
The verbicide mind game is unrelenting in how it is designed to hook the believer into thinking he has a " special " understanding .
The principal synergy of this mind game is with the first mind game to reinforce the warm and fuzzy feeling that the believer has , through divine " grace , " been given access to something special and deeply meaningful , not available to the " unsaved . "
The fourth mind game is an assault on ethical and moral integrity .
By ethical and moral integrity , we mean that ability as well as propensity to understand the situations and dilemmas of others and act accordingly with compassion , understanding and concern , as well as in harmony with one 's understanding of reality and one 's self - knowledge as well .
It sounds strange to hear such a claim made with regards to a people who , when casually seen from the outside , would appear to be full of love and concern , and posessed of a powerful ethical system .
The reality , however , is that the believer often is encouraged to hate certain groups of people ( usually a " morally suspect " group , such as abortion doctors , feminists , homosexuals , secular humanists , etc. ) who represent some sort of threat , perceived or real , to the spread of the meme complex or the cohesiveness of the believers .
The hatred is seldom expressed openly , except in the most conservative and extreme evangelicals , and a facade of loving tolerance is presented to non-believers to make them believe that the believer has achieved a state of accepting , loving tolerance to non-believers who may be a threat .
Instead , a code - word system ( a synergy with the verbicide mind game ) is used .
For example , " family values " is a code - word for homophobia , " loving the sinner but hating the sin " is a code word for the license to hate homosexuality and , by extension , homosexuals .
The facade of sweet , loving calmness , is itself a lie .
Inwardly , the believer is usually ( though not always ) full of raging doubts and concerns , frightened that he 's instructed to hate and yet show love and tolerance , and is struggling to maintain the synergy of the first two mind games , i.e. , the denial of the contrary evidence he sees all around him , and the warmness of the conversion experience .
On top of this , he is struggling to maintain the fiction that all is calm and self - assurance .
Hence the compromise of integrity .
It 's quite an acting job , to the outside world but even more to himself .
Yet the " still waters " that this state is called , is considered essential .
And it is - it 's essential to hide the inner conflicts from being visible to believer where it might cause doubts to surface , and to the non-believer who is himself a prospective convert .
The rare believers who do not harbor doubts and concerns , and are not troubled by the inconsistencies , have done so by highly developing their dissociation skills - i.e. , have compartmentalized their thinking to the extent that obvious contradictions do not cause cognitive dissonance .
There are many other examples to which I could refer as well , such as the rejection of scientific facts one knows to be true , the denial of the conflicts of fact and doctrine that exist throughout the believer 's belief system as they relate to his understanding of the world around him .
The fifth mind game is the induction of dissociation .
It is the dissociation of the ideas in the mind of the believer from the reality he sees all around him .
It is really the essence of the synergy of all the mind games working together .
This is where psychology as we understand it begins to get involved in our discussion .
Here is where subtle , psychological effects , resulting from the synergies of all the mind games working together , begin to create real psychological changes in the believer .
It is right at the core of the believer 's experience .
Dissociation of his personality with the realities around him is what enables the believer to maintain the fictions of his doctrines as being reality in his mind .
The drive for dissociation is vitally important .
It is a difficult state to achieve and maintain , as it requires constant , enormous effort .
But it is the essence of maintaining conversion , so it is vital to the process of maintaining the conversion .
Dissociation even extends to such basic drives as the libido .
The sincere , committed evangelical Christian seeks to displace his libido to associate it with the Trinity and the Gospel , so that libido drives one on to " higher states " of " love " of the gospel and one 's understanding of God , even to the extent that one does not even have sexual temptation of a more earthly kind .
This kind of tension requires almost constant mind control , a state few are able to achieve .
But achieving it is considered neccessary by many evangelicals for complete " submission " to Jesus .
It is truly the ultimate form of dissociation .
Burning of bridges is the sixth mind game .
Not being able to go back is a way of keeping the converted from abandoning the conversion to second thoughts .
We see evidence of this mind game all through the New Testament ; Jesus saying that he will divide families , he has come with a sword , etc .
The burning of bridges among groups of Christians is done by binding the believers together so tightly that they cannot easily leave , though care is taken to ensure that paths remain open so others can easily join .
Here is where evangelical Christianity resembles cult religions more than anywhere else ; the Christian invites others to join by paying lip service to listening to them ( while carefully filtering out any ' dangerous ' ideas the infidel may present ) , and appearing to be friendly , loving and caring .
It never occurs to the believer how , in filtering out dangerous ideas , the presentation of a listening facade represents a dishonest act .
The higher good of " bringing in the harvest " is appealed to , with the belief that somehow , lying for Jesus through the facade one presents , is somehow not wrong .
In the mind of the believer , the bridges are burned by the doctrine of blasphemy .
The tool of fear is imposed to make the believer fear that if he should reject the doctrine , he would have blasphemed against the holy spirit , and in so doing would be consigned to hell forever and ever .
It is this fear of the greatest of sins that burns the bridge .
The believer can't turn back , because doing so would consign him to hell .
A very effective technique used to bind believers together against the threat of blasphemy is the " false prophets " threat .
If the believer should fall under the spell of a false prophet , he is doomed again to be consigned to hell .
This keeps the believer in the circle , depending on using others to verify his understanding , and preventing him from straying from the " truth . "
Again , there are many other examples that space here does not permit to be quoted .
The seventh and final mind game is fear .
Yes , good old fashioned " hell - fire and damnation . "
Of course it has its greatest effect on the ignorant and superstitious , but it can be an effective motivator even among the learned when it synergizes well with other mind games , such as the burning of bridges and the induction of dissociation .
It would appear that this conflicts directly with the sweet , likable persona of the first mind game .
It actually does n't ; they work well together as a carrot and stick .
Even a casual reading of the New Testament will uncover plenty of examples of this mind game .
Damnation , judgement , punishment for sin , blasphemy , etc. , all are based on the fear mind game , and are so commonly employed by evangelicals they 've become a stereotype .
The Meme 's Vector and Its Method of Spread
The Billy Graham evangelist who is preaching to a circus tent full of believers he is pretending to be potential converts is really an anachronism .
In true evolutionary fashion , more potential hosts for the virus can be reached electronically for far less money , by means that did n't even exist a half century ago .
The ' virus ' has ' mutated ' to meet this opportunity and has been wildly successful in doing so , often with the help of ' viral hosts ' placed in positions of political power to clear regulatory barriers .
Pathology of the Meme : Implications for Mental Health , Politics , and Society
Well , social scientists , themselves often hosts of the meme of Christianity , have been reluctant to examine that question , because of the deepness of the assumption , and the politics that it creates .
But in recent years , a few brave souls who have been willing to risk their careers for the sake of truth have begun to look at the question .
What is becoming clear is that conservative fundamentalist Christians are not at all like they are perceived .
The educated humanist normally assumes that the conservative Christian has a few , clear , simple unambiguous answers for the questions with which he is presented , and has a low tolerance for ambiguity .
The reality is quite the opposite .
When one examines the pathology of this meme , it becomes clear that the conservative Christian actually has a wide range of answers , many of which are conflicting and ambiguous , because he has , through his conversion process , cultivated a tolerance for ambiguity .
It is the only way that he can compartmentalize a wide range of ideas , many of which are conflicting , many of which are contrary to the evidence of every day life , and still maintain his faith .
Of course this cultivation of tolerance for ambiguity has consequences in everyday life .
The ability to compartmentalize mutually conflicting ideas means that he is a setup for political ideologies that do n't make sense , that run contrary to his interests or make his life more difficult .
It is not surprising , then , that the National Socialism of Adolph Hitler was originally couched in Christian terms , and strongly promoted as a Christian ideology , and early on was most popular among Christian evangelicals .
The undermining of integrity that we have explored also has serious implications .
It means that lying to oneself becomes easier to do , and has less likelihood of producing a self examination .
The assurance that one is " saved " means one need spend less time in introspection and self - examination , and of course , that is precisely the intent of the meme 's authors .
By avoiding self - examination , the consequences of conversion are not likely to be examined .
It is not surprising , then , to those who truly understand Christianity as a meme and the mind games it plays in its converts , that when conservative evangelicals achieve political power , corruption is often the result .
Those who understand the compartmentalized thinking along with the undermined integrity and the tolerance for ambiguity realize that the evangelical will often turn a blind eye to corruption .
This is why we have seen such a long series of Christian televangelists being exposed in acts of sordid corruption .
And it's not a surprise that Ronald Reagan , the most committed Christian of recent American presidents , presided over the most corrupt administration in American history , with fully ten percent of his appointees being indicted or convicted of felonies committed while in office .
Surely , these phenomena demand a close examination by social scientists .
The stakes are simply too high to ignore .
Especially when Christian evangelicals are poised to take control of the political process and thereby be placed in a position to forcibly expose others to the meme complex , much as has been done in centuries past .
The overwhelming influence of the hosts of this meme complex , influence far out of proportion to their numbers in society , can be attributed partly to the unchallenged assumption that religion is a net positive force in society , but also , and probably primarily , to the unity of purpose that this meme complex creates in its hosts .
By welding this unity of purpose with political activism , a truly awesome political machine is readily created .
Hitler was one leader who recognized this , but he was hardly alone , and certainly not the first .
Today , Jerry Falwell , who hardly has anything approaching a unified body of believers behind him , but who has a political influence that is amazing , given his extreme politics , has the cynical conservative politicians on his side .
Of course , cynical politicians are quick to realize and sieze upon the potential that an alliance with evangelicals can provide .
The effect of this influence on public policy can be frightening indeed .
A typical example is the abortion debate .
Nowhere in the bible is there a clear prohibition of the practice ; it is assumed to be proscribed on the basis of a single verse , " whoso sheddeth a man 's blood , by man shall his blood be shed " ( Gen. 9:6 ) .
Out of that whole cloth , evangelicals have cut the doctrine that their god not only forbids man to abort a fetus , but even a zygote ( the cell resulting from the fusion of sperm and egg ) , and they even assume the right , again entirely without biblical foundation , to impose that view on non-believers .
With hard - core , committed fundamentalists amounting to only about 9 percent of the population of the U.S. , the notion that their views could soon become the law of that land speaks volumes about their organization and zeal , and their commitment to spread the meme complex by whatever means neccessary .
How Did This Meme Complex Come To Be ?
Conclusions
Besides the public policy issues , there is the mental health issue of the hosts of the meme complex as well .
How many suffer , without understanding what has happened to them , that they are the targets of a system originally designed two thousand years ago to preserve a culture and religion from an immediate threat , and give their means and their lives over to it ?
How many families are broken , how many lives ruined , how many friendships destroyed , simply because everyone assumes that because it 's religion , it 's good ?
How many innocent victims , such as humanists , gays and feminists , should be made to suffer so that the meme complex can be allowed to propagate freely ?
The time has come for some serious study of this phenomenon , both from a personal mental health and a public policy perspective .
And the time has come that we should base our public policies on what we now know are the consequences of being infected with this meme complex .
We are now well aware of the consequences for the believers and their families , neighbors and society .
Can we stand by and allow the unfortunate consequences of this meme complex to continue to propagate themselves ?
Personally , I think not .
One and a half millenia ago , the meme complex led to the destruction of the Great Library of Alexandria .
That single act , for which the perpetrator was sainted , led to the stifling of scientific progress for more than a millenium , and allowed the death and persecution of millions .
We know better now .
Let us not make that same mistake again .
The Demon Haunted World : Science As A Candle In The Dark is Dr. Carl Sagan 's last book , and an excellent analysis of the effects of unexamined belief .
This best seller is an easy read , and can't be recommended highly enough .
The Mind of the Bible Believer is Edmund Cohen 's excellent analysis of how and why the Bible ( and specifically the New Testament ) was written to hook the non-believer .
It is 400 + pages of a somewhat tedious read at times , occasionally straying from the subject , but nevertheless well worthwhile , as it is thorough in its treatment , exhaustively researched and carefully documented .
It is the definitive book on this subject and was the source material for much of this essay .
This book is not a polemic , it is a carefully considered scholarly analysis that can only be described as fair , and is a vital resource for someone seeking to understand the Bible and the mindset of its followers .
That ’s the argument Nouriel " Dr. Doom " Roubini -- one of the few analysts who foresaw the credit crisis -- makes in an opinion piece he co-authored for the Financial Times this week .
Pretty bold stuff , but given the stakes , is n’t it at least worth considering ?
Extra capital required = failed institution ?
Roubini is mistaken that the market will consider that the banks that require additional capital are failed institutions -- barring them from being able to raise private capital and pushing them into the government ’s arms .
Both Wells Fargo ( NYSE : WFC ) and Morgan Stanley ( NYSE : MS ) have announced multi-billion dollar common share offerings on the heels of the results -- I expect both of these to be successful .
( The ability of regional banks such as Regions Financial ( NYSE:RF ) , KeyCorp ( NYSE : KEY ) , and SunTrust Banks ( NYSE : STI ) is admittedly less clear - cut . )
How to manage a large bank failure
Even if a large bank failure does n’t play out during this crisis , Roubini 's notion that large bank failure could be managed such that it poses no wider systemic risk warrants some attention .
Still , it sounds too good to be true -- how is that possible ?
Firstly , Roubini says that the risk of contagion has decreased since the failure of Lehman Brothers last year ; in that respect , the stress tests have been helpful in letting investors differentiate between weak and strong institutions .
And secondly , the fear of counterparty risk could be mitigated by having the government step in and act as the ultimate counterparty for all trades .
This is the role of the clearinghouse in exchanges such as the CME ( NYSE : CME ) .
Finally , the government could guarantee depositors ’ assets ( to avoid bank runs ) , while allowing bank creditors to lose money -- who appear absolutely unwilling to consider .
Bring back old - fashioned market discipline
" Too big to fail " is itself a failed concept .
The fear of the perceived consequences of a large bank failure is preventing us from imagining a framework within which authorities could unwind a failed institution with minimal disruption to capital markets and the economy .
It ’s high time authorities stopped hiding behind an idea that has become dogma and settled on a smaller -- albeit a critical , enabling role -- that would allow for the return of market discipline .

Base , soulless and ultimately devoid of any moral code not rooted in expediency , American politics has devolved into a perpetual celebration of the medieval Feast of Fools , where a grotesque and deleterious pantomime has been grafted over those activities found in sound societies .
In an attempt to make good my oath to live not by lies , I have , for the most part , been able to swear off all things politic , but a story caught my eye and — alas — I am temporarily off the wagon .
What was the headline that has driven me to cry out on the keyboard ?
" Sotomayor Quits Belizean Grove "
So multilayer is the societal rot in those four words , so emblematic are they of where we find ourselves .
In honor of the quickly fading generation of Roman Catholic nuns who taught some of us to diagram sentences , let ’s savor every sour word .
Sotomayor :
The subject of the sentence , Sonia Sotomayor , is a nominee to be a justice of the Supreme Court .
You might assume that someone talented enough to be considered as a top jurist would cut an interesting figure of a person , but then again you would be laboring under the misapprehension that the most talented people are the ones who rise to the top in the cesspool of American politics .
It is n’t just cream that rises .
Bohemian Grove : Cult O... Mike Hanson Best Price : $ 8.06 Buy New $ 9.05 ( as of 10:46 EST - Details )
What little I have seen of Sotomayor bores me .
Is she qualified ?
In a certain sense she is ultimately qualified to be on the Supreme Court .
She has the proper pedigree .
For the politically correct , social engineering , lefty scrabble - letter - value types , she is a double minority : Latina and female .
For the less superficial , she has a law degree from Yale , i.e. , she is an establishment type through and through .
To be fair , maybe the Yale J.D. by itself does not make one a minion of darkness ( but then again , maybe it does ) .
But Sotomayor has displayed that oh - so - unbecoming - and - slightly - creepy Yalie habit of wanting to belong to quasi- elitist cliques , which brings us to our direct object .
Belizean Grove : Belizean Grove ?
A Johnny - come- lately , Spice Girl - power alternative to the shadowy über - elite boys ’ club , Bohemian Grove ?
As the brilliant Florence King once noted about Southern culture : sin is more tolerated than faux pas .
Perhaps it is that sensibility that is coming out in me when I blush at the thought of the , er , Belizean Grove .
What phenomenally bad taste .
While I have no love for the real Bohos , whether true or not , their gathering is cloaked in a Faustian mystique which gives it some type of cache .
Is Bohemian Grove a secret gay orgy or some type of summer camp for satanists ?
Who knows ?
But to sign up for some Brummagem , ladies ’ auxiliary version of Bohemian Grove is not only embarrassing , but it shows an uncomely lusting and groping for poweru2014elite power , secret power .
By signing up for the New Coke of secret societies , Sonia gave a glimpse of what is in her soul .
She and her BeHo ( ? ) sisters by creating their club all but admitted they are not " illuminati " but have shown themselves to be something worse — would - be , self - appointed illuminati .
This mind - set brings us to our verb .
Quits :
When her membership in Belizean Grove came to light , Sonia Sotomayor quit and all the poor dopes in TV - land are supposed to think that everything is groovy cool .
I ’m afraid not .
I ’m sure Sotomayor and the BeHos would tell us that if they had just been born AC rather than DC then they would be allowed to dance around a giant owl in the real grove and none of this would really matter .
This proves to them that women are still oppressed and a double standard is still operational in the 21st century .
Not quite .
This proves that the lust for power knows no sex discrimination .
The Bohemian Grove is repulsive in that it represents a collection of men who have been born to power or who have grasped power and whose desire is to associate with others for the sole purpose of maintaining , if not expanding , the power that they have .
Such behavior is at its root immoral and none of those men are fit to have any power over the lives of ordinary people .
For a poor Puerto Rican girl to want to emulate the very worst in these " elites " is not only a sad sight , but a very dangerous one .
The Best of C.T. Rossi
SCO Group 's long - standing legal battles over its claimed Unix copyrights may finally end with US bankruptcy court forcing a Chapter 7 cyanide capsule down the company 's throat .
On Tuesday , the trustee appointed by the federal bankruptcy court in Delaware asked for permission to dissolve the ailing shell - of - a - software - company and pawn off its assets .
Trustee Roberta DeAngelis told the presiding judge in a filing that that SCO has " no reasonable change of rehabilitation , " adding the company has " tried — and failed — to liquidate their business in chapter 11 . "
In September 2007 , SCO filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection , which shields the company from creditors while it reorganizes the biz .
Forcing the firm into Chapter 7 would require an appointed independent trustee to sell all of SCO 's assets and distribute the proceeds to its creditors .
" We are reviewing the motion with counsel and will have a detailed response for the court in due course , " SCO told El Reg in an e-mailed statement .
" We plan to oppose the motion and present our own suggested course of action to the court . "
The bankruptcy judge now has three options .
He can approve Chapter 7 , accept a SCO survival plan under Chapter 11 if it somehow scrounges up the money to pay off its debts , or dismiss the bankruptcy protection plea completely .
That decision is likely to come during a hearing set for June 12 .
SCO 's mess began about a decade ago , when Novell sold Unix trademarks and other assets to the firm .
SCO assumed that deal included copyrights to Unix code , and the company used this claim to force Sun Microsystems and Microsoft into licensing agreements .
It then sued IBM in 2003 , claiming the computer giant was using the allegedly copyrighted technology in its Linux kernel .
A year later , SCO filed a slander of action lawsuit against Novell after the company said it still , in fact , owned the disputed Unix copyrights in SCO 's case against IBM .
After three years of legal battling , a US district judge in Delaware ruled in Novell 's favor and ordered SCO to pay nearly $ 2.5 m in royalties to Novell for unjust enrichment .
SCO filed for bankruptcy about one month after the court 's initial ruling .
The company is hoping to overturn the decision on appeal .
A copy of motion for chapter 7 is available here ( PDF ) ®
The Defense Department is continuing its push to reduce human thought and human action to a few lines of code .
The latest effort comes from the Air Force Office of Scientific Research , which is looking to build " mathematical or computational models of human attention , memory , categorization , reasoning , problem solving , learning and motivation , and decision making . "
The ultimate goal , according to a recent request for research proposals , is to " elucidate core computational algorithms of the mind and brain . "
Good luck with that , guys .
It 's one in a heap of different Office projects to try to teach machines to act more like living things .
" Nature has used evolution to build materials and sensors that outperform current sensors ( for example , a spider ’s haircells can detect air flow at low levels even in a noisy background ) , " the Office writes .
So it 's got a second program , to not only " mimic existing natural sensory systems , but also add existing capabilities to these organisms " so they can more " precise[ly ] control " their God - given gifts .
For example , maybe the military can develop better " active and passive camouflage " by learning from creatures who are able to change color , to hide from their predators .
Maybe the armed forces can improve on eznymes which would eat away at an enemy 's gear .

The Office also wants to know what makes collections of living creatures tick .
So the Office is looking to assemble a " fundamental understanding of the interactions between demographic groups ... to explain and predict outcomes between competing factions within geographic regions . "
It wants to " identify and quantify cultural variability " to model the effects of an " info warfare campaign " online .

NEW YORK ( CNN ) --
The New York State Assembly passed a same - sex marriage bill Tuesday evening , bringing New York one step closer to legalizing such marriages .
Gov. David Paterson has said he'd sign a same - sex if it 's passed by the New York Senate .
The bill , which passed 89 - 52 , will now go on to the state Senate for a vote .
If it is passed there , it will go to Gov. David Paterson , who has made it clear he will sign the bill .
" I applaud ... members of both parties for moving this historic legislation forward , " New York City Mayor Michael Bloomberg said in a statement released by the mayor 's office .
" I hope New York will soon become the latest state to adopt a law whose time has come . "
State Sen. Thomas K. Duane , a Democrat , said in a statement , " I am confident that this year my Senate will uphold this fundamental legal principle and vote for my right , our right , to be married this year . "
This is the second time New York 's Marriage Equality Legislation has been approved by the State Assembly -- it passed in 2007 , but subsequently stalled in the then Republican - controlled Senate .

Toward 1990s Japan ?
University of Oregon economics professor and Economist 's View blogger Mark Thoma filed this guest post .
More than a year ago , I called for the Federal Reserve to begin aggressively removing toxic assets from the balance sheets of troubled banks in order to minimize the fallout from the collapse of the mortgage market .
Shortly after that , the Paulson plan emerged , and the essence of the plan followed along these lines .
But the plan was never implemented because of problems valuing the toxic assets , among other things , and with the election approaching , the decision was made to leave the toxic - asset problem for the new administration to resolve .
Once the new administration took over , it began developing its own plan , and after a few false starts , Timothy Geithner 's Public - Private Investment Program was announced .
It appears that this plan may actually be put into place , but here we are more than a year from when everyone knew we had to do something , yet we are still waiting for a plan to be implemented .
How much better would the economy be now if we had planned for something like this , and executed the plan immediately ?
If a quick response was needed , and it was , why did the new administration opt for the PPIP even though it delayed the implementation of a financial rescue plan for several more months ?
The new administration had three basic options to choose from : some version of the Paulson plan whereby the government buys assets directly from troubled banks ; nationalization whereby the government temporarily takes over entire banks ; and its own plan , which turned out to be the PPIP .
Although the Paulson plan could have been put in place relatively fast , it bails out those responsible for the problems we are having , making it politically infeasible , and the toxic - asset - valuation problem is difficult to overcome .
The public would have strenuously objected to this plan , and rightly so .
Nationalization is , in my view , the surest way to proceed in terms of resolving the problem , and it also distributes the burden more equitably .
But the costs of this approach could be very high , it was tagged with the " socialism " label ; there was no on - the - shelf plan like this ; and the government does not have the legal powers it needs to put nontraditional banks through the bankruptcy process , something that Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke mentioned again and again in today 's hearing .
So that left the PPIP , which is much cheaper and less politically volatile and could be implemented under existing authority .
But it is risky in that it relies on the creation of a set of economic incentives intended to induce the private sector to join the government in taking the assets off the banks ' balance sheets .
My fear , and it's one buttressed by both Bernanke 's testimony today and by what we are hearing about the stress tests , is that the political environment has put us on the path the Japanese followed in the 1990s : doing just enough to keep troubled banks alive but never decisively solving the problem .
The result in the Japanese case was a sustained period of economic problems and slow growth , and we may be headed in the same direction .
If the Geithner toxic - asset - removal plan does n't work as intended -- and there 's no guarantee that private - sector participants will step forward in sufficient numbers -- or if the stress tests were not strict enough , missed essential risks , etc. , and some of the banks are in much worse shape than we thought , will policymakers be willing to change course ?
Or will they continue to avoid the more costly but arguably more effective solution of nationalization , cite the stress tests as evidence that banks are relatively healthy and continue to string banks along through a series of capital injections in the hopes that the PPIP will eventually work ?
It 's been convenient for all involved to say that the legal authority for putting these banks through bankruptcy ( nationalization ) does not exist , so we have little choice but to stick with the PPIP and hope it eventually works , but Congress could change the law quickly to grant the necessary authority if it really wanted to .
But it prefers to avoid the more costly , yet more certain , step and invest in hope instead .
Policymakers have a lot of time and effort and their own reputations wrapped up in the PPIP program , and they do not want to pursue costly solutions given the state of the federal budget .
So they will not abandon the current course easily , something that today 's testimony made clear .
For that reason , I hope I am wrong about the stress tests and they really do tell us about the health of banks instead of mainly providing political cover , and that the PPIP works better than we could have hoped .
Because if it does n't , we wo n't save a thing by following in Japan 's footsteps and sticking with programs that only prolong the inevitable .

By DAVID TIRRELL - WYSOCKI
CONCORD , N.H. ( AP ) --
Until recently , it was just a T - shirt with a colorful design of three wolves howling at the moon .
Now , it 's a viral sensation with its own Facebook page , videos and an exploding following that has swamped a tiny New Hampshire company .
All because a customer posted a tongue - in - cheek comment on Amazon.com saying the " Three Wolf Moon " helped make him a babe magnet .
While images of the shirt and comments about its powers sweep the Internet , employees at The Mountain in Keene are caught up in a storm , and working overtime to make the best of it .
" We 're laughing a lot more than we used to , " owner Michael Krinsky said Thursday .
The T - shirt , designed by Florida artist Antonia Neshev , has taken over the production line in the basement of a 200 - year - old mill building , though it took a while for the rumbling to reach The Mountain .
Rutgers University law student Brian Govern posted his comment last fall , saying , among other things : " Fits my girthy frame , has wolves on it , attracts women . "
Thousands responded to his comment , adding to the shirt 's alleged powers .
" We did n't pick up on it , " Krinsky said .
" We did n't know anything was happening , and all of a sudden we were told , ' Hey , come on .
This shirt is selling like crazy .
Then we were told it was the No. 1 apparel item on Amazon , and then we realized what was going on and it kept on going from there . "
He said they now are selling thousands a day .
At Amazon.com , spokeswoman Stephanie Robinett said the shirt , seriously , has been No. 1 since May 19 , but not - so - seriously , " We can't confirm that the shirt is actually magical or has powers . "
RELATED LINKS
The customer comments have given the shirt a life of its own .
" Unfortunately , " one customer posted , " I already had this exact picture tattooed on my chest , but this shirt is very useful in colder weather . "
One " disappointed " customer wrote that after wearing his T - shirt for several weeks , he was beginning to believe some of the benefits were exaggerated .
" For example , not ONE supermodel has approached me , " he wrote .
The company responded that it does not guarantee wearers will become " a magnet for supermodels . "
The company also has posted an account of how the shirts are delivered to them " saddled to the backs of Pegacorns ( unicorn - Pegasus hybrids ) , " hand - dyed by monks , dragged through the ocean by eagles and dropped back in New Hampshire .
" By wearing 3WM , you agree that your life may change in ways that could be the greatest of gifts or the worst of curses , " The Mountain says .
" By wearing 3 WM you give up all rights to a normal life . "
, a company specialising in the prevention of computer hacking , has sent round a press release questioning the security of in - flight internet .
Netragard claims that Gogo Inflight , an internet service run by Aircell and used by American Airlines , Delta and Virgin , does not encrypt communications between passengers and the plane ’s wireless access points .
“ As a result , ” says the company , “ it is extremely easy for a hacker on board to intercept and record all data sent and received by passengers . ”
This all sounds very serious .
Is it true ?
Joe Cruz , Aircell 's Chief Technology Officer , clears matters up .
" Our capabilities are not much different from what you encounter in hotel rooms , in Starbucks and in public hotspots , " he tells me .
" And if you 're on the ground , you 're actually more susceptible to spamming because hackers know where you are . "
So there does n't seem to be any great need to heed Netragard 's claim .
Indeed , Mr Cruz suggests that you 're actually safer using Wi-Fi in the air than on the ground .
" If you ’re in an airplane , you ’re with a select group of people , " he says .
" One of the great screeners is the $ 365 you pay to get on the plane . "
Gulliver does n't see why the price of a ticket would necessarily put off a hacker , or why hackers would refrain from their dodgy habit in the air .
But if Wi-Fi security is essentially the same in the air as on the ground , that sounds good enough .
After all , if you want more security , you can use a virtual private network .
And I can't help wondering how much sensitive information a hacker at 36,000 feet would actually find .
Tom Weigman , Aircell 's Executive Vice President of Wireless Services , says e-mail accounts for 40 % of Gogo 's “ usage count ” ( essentially , time users are spending online ) .
After e-mail , the most popular sites are Google , Facebook , Yahoo , etc : the usual suspects .
So yes , it pays to surf sensibly .
But the plane is no less safe an internet environment than the coffee house or the hotel lobby .
Netragard ’s case is not proved .
UPDATE May 7th 2009 Gulliver spoke to Adriel Desautels , one of Netragard ’s co-founders , earlier today .
He reiterated a number of the points made in his company 's name in the comments below .
“ When you purchase Wi-Fi at Starbucks , ” he says , “ you get protection with WPA2 .
Aircell has no protection . ”
WPA2 encrypts communications between a user 's computer and wireless access points , so even if a hacker can access the communications , they will be unintelligible .
Mr Desautels adds that , contrary to Aircell 's belief , hackers will indeed be attracted to planes .
" There 's a high concentration of business users , " he says .
" For hackers to spend $ 365 for a ticket is nothing . "
If hackers in the air can use their skills to get access to credit - card details and business networks , then he is right .
But Aircell 's Mr Cruz is not going to debate with him : " I do n't want to engage them [ Netragard ] in public / tell them where they are wrong , " he says , " since that would involve revealing our security processes . "
Hmm .
Gulliver is no technology expert and puts forward these opinions without being able to add a whole lot .
But those of you who know your WAP2 from your SSL should offer guidance below .

Got any that I missed ?
California , 1913
The first state marijuana prohibition law was passed in California in 1913 .
The law received no public notice in the press .
It was passed as an obscure technical amendment by the State Board of Pharmacy , which was then leading one of the nation 's earliest and most aggressive anti-narcotics campaigns .
Prior to the passage of the law , there was no indication that cannabis was a problem in California .
The Origins of Cannabis Prohibition in California from California NORML
Utah , 1914
Utah outlawed marijuana in 1914 .
A number of Mormons moved to Mexico when polygamy was outlawed in Utah in 1910 .
When they returned to Utah , marijuana was one of the things they brought back with them .
Marijuana was outlawed with a number of other common vices as part of Mormon religious prohibitions enacted into law .
Other state laws 1915 - 37
Marijuana was outlawed in 30 states by 1930 .
There were two primary reasons for the laws .
In the southwestern states , marijuana was outlawed because of racial prejudice against the Mexicans who used it .
As one Texas legislator said , " All Mexicans are crazy and this stuff ( marijuana ) is what makes them crazy . "
In the other states , it was outlawed because of fears that heroin addiction would lead to the use of marijuana - exactly the opposite of the modern " gateway " myth .
The Marihuana Tax Act of 1937
Marijuana was outlawed at the national level in the US by the Marihuana Tax Act of 1937 .
( Note that the US Government has traditionally used the spelling " marihuana " . )
There were a number of reasons given for its passage in the congressional testimony .
The quotes included :
Two weeks ago a sex - mad degenerate , named Lee Fernandez , brutally attacked a young Alamosa girl .
He was convicted of assault with intent to rape and sentenced to 10 to 14 years in the state penitentiary .
Police officers here know definitely that Fernandez was under the influence of marihuana .
But this case is one in hundreds of murders , rapes , petty crimes , insanity that has occurred in southern Colorado in recent years .
I wish I could show you what a small marihuana cigaret can do to one of our degenerate Spanish - speaking residents .
That 's why our problem is so great ; the greatest percentage of our population is composed of Spanish - speaking persons , most of who are low mentally , because of social and racial conditions .
Did you read of the Drain murder case in Pueblo recently ?
Marihuana is believed to have been used by one of the bloody murderers .
. . .a boy and a girl . . . lost their senses so completely after smoking marihuana that they eloped and were married .
It is commonly used as an aphrodisiac , and its continued use leads to impotency .
Practically every article written on the effects of the marihuana weed will tell of deeds committed without the knowledge of the culprit , while he was under the influence of this drug .
. . .
" A man under the influence of marihuana actually decapitated his best friend ; and then , coming out of the effects of the drug , was as horrified as anyone over what he had done " ( 9 ) .
Then we have the case of a young boy in Florida .
The story runs as follows : " A young boy who had become addicted to smoking marihuana cigarettes , in a fit of frenzy because , as he stated while still under the marihuana influence , a number of people were trying to cut off his arms and legs , seized an axe and killed his father , mother , two brothers and a sister , wiping out the entire family except himself . " ( 10 )
There was no credible evidence that any of these statements were actually true .

North Korea 's military celebrated the controversial nuclear and missile tests North Korea is reported to have fired another missile , despite US warnings it would " pay a price " for nuclear and missile tests in recent days .
The launch of the missile coincides with efforts to secure a UN Security Council resolution condemning the country 's nuclear programme .
Washington says it is seeking a " quick and unified response " to the tests .
Earlier on Tuesday North Korea conducted an underground nuclear test and fired two short - range missiles .
The Yonhap news agency said the short - range missile was fired off North Korea 's east coast , citing an unnamed South Korean government source .
Delicate balance Washington is calling for a quick and unified response by the international community that will make it clear to North Korea that there are consequences for its actions .
Diplomats from the five permanent Security Council member countries plus Japan and South Korea met behind closed doors to discuss a new resolution .
The US ambassador to the UN , Susan Rice , said after the meeting that a " good start " had been made but the discussions would take " some time " .
" We are thinking through complicated issues that require very careful consideration , " she said .
Your views : Should world worry ?
Reaction from around the region
What is N Korea 's game plan ?
Factfile : Underground testing US Secretary of State Hillary Clinton spoke earlier to Russia 's Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov , as well her counterparts from China , South Korea , Japan and Australia .
The Obama administration said it was pleased with the decisive reaction so far , especially from Russia and China .
But US State Department spokesman Ian Kelly also indicated it was not too late for North Korea .
Mr Kelly said the door was still open to resume long - running six - party talks and that the US was looking at a " whole range of options " .
It is a sign of the delicate balance required to handle the reclusive country , the BBC's State Department correspondent Kim Ghattas reports from Washington .
China shares a border with North Korea and worries about pushing Pyongyang too far , so it is unclear what sort of measures might be taken now and how North Korea would respond , our correspondent adds .
One option would involve enforcing sanctions already in place and to start inspecting shipments in and out of North Korea for the first time .
' Hostile policy '
Ms Rice said earlier that international pressure on North Korea would increase , until it realised the tests had left it " further isolated and further debilitated " .
She said the international community would not " throw up our hands and let them pursue this path " and that North Korea would " pay a price for their action " .
Earlier , the Security Council unanimously condemned the tests .
Diplomats said they were seeking " tough measures " , including further sanctions .
The Communist state responded by firing two short - range missiles off an east - coast base hours later , South Korea 's Yonhap news agency reported , citing an official .
The agency said the tests involved one ground - to - ship missile and one ground - to - air missile .
Earlier , North Korea , in a statement carried by its official news agency KCNA , said it was clear America 's " hostile policy " towards it had not changed .

Q&A : North Korea nuclear test
What are N Korea 's motives ?
On Tuesday , Asian and European foreign ministers attending the two - day biennial Asem Summit in Hanoi issued a statement condemning the test and calling for an immediate return to talks .
The issue was also expected to dominate talks between Chinese and South Korean defence ministers as they met in Beijing .
Monday 's blast , which seismologists said had the power of a 4.5 magnitude earthquake , appears to have been much more powerful than North Korea 's first nuclear test .
Defence officials in Russia say it was an explosion of up to 20 kilotons , making it comparable to the American bombs that flattened Hiroshima and Nagasaki in 1945 .
The test came after North Korea walked away from long - running disarmament talks .
It agreed in February 2007 to abandon its nuclear ambitions in return for aid and diplomatic concessions .
But the negotiations stalled as it accused its negotiating partners - the US , South Korea , Japan , China and Russia - of failing to meet agreed obligations .

Thus we have :
294,000,000,000,000 leaves
vs .
100,000,000,000,000,000 ants
or around 340 ants per leaf .
You may often find your self wondering :
Here is the answer : EO Wilson , a noted Harvard biologist and expert on ants , estimate s that the number of ants in the world is between ten to the sixteenth and ten to the seventeen or : Forest s represent a third of the earth 's land .
On average they can support 200 trees per acre .
9.8 billion acres of forest in the world .
( 1995 estimate ) 9,800,000,000 acres of forest X 200 trees / acre = 1,960,000,000,000 trees
The number of leaves per a tree varies widely .
Most trees are pine s with thousands of leaves .
Some only have hundreds .
let 's use 1500 ( low thousands ) as a high estimate .
In recent years the number of trees has fallen sharply due to clearcutting .
The number of trees per acre and the number of forest ares I used were high .
Even if we used a higher number of leaves like 7000 ( the number found on the largest pine trees ) the number of leaves would still fall far short of the many many ants in the world .
Ants win hands down by two orders of magnitude
Rockstar released two new screenshots for ‘ Max Payne 3 ′ and tweeted “ He ’s coming ” .
The game was delayed since 2009 , but seem like Rockstar Vancouver will be finally releasing the game soon for the PS3 , Xbox 360 , and PC .
When I was but an intern reporter at a daily newspaper , I got an assignment I 'll never forget .
Due to a lack of drainage in the South Valley , even a little bit of precipitation sent rivers of rainwater up to and beyond doorsteps .
A big rain for one of my eventual sources meant moving the kids out to the camper to sleep because the water level in his house was higher than the electrical outlets .
I say he was an " eventual " source because it was damn hard for me to coax anyone into talking about it .
I 'd interviewed the public officials and maintenance guys who were responsible for sucking the water out of the streets after a storm .
But the last narrative component , a South Valley resident besieged by rainwater in the desert , was a far greater challenge .
One lady even cracked a smile and said something like : " The newspaper ?
What are you doing down here ? "
I drove down to the most affected neighborhood and parked my crappy , one - eyed Kia .
I pounded the dusty non-sidewalk and knocked on doors .
Some people were home and yelled through the door that they " did n't want any . "
Some came out to chat , gave excellent quotes and then said they did n't want to be in any newspaper .
Still more often , I would explain who I was and what I was doing , and people would shut the door in my still talking face with a polite , " No , thank you . "
One lady even cracked a smile and said something like : " The newspaper ?
What are you doing down here ? "
It takes a certain mindset to believe that what 's happening to you is a ) wrong , b ) someone 's fault and c ) something other people should know about .
It was a long few hours .
I got bit by a dog .
But it was n't the mild canine attack that caused that hot , dusty day to bind to my memory .
Rather , it was the extreme reluctance of anyone I spoke with to trust me or , in a larger sense , the media .
I can't guess at what all those people were thinking or why they were thinking it .
But I can tell you that I 've never dealt with so many who wanted absolutely nothing to do with being in a newspaper .
And I 'm willing to wager that even in the Land of Enchantment , race and class have something to do with that distrust .
There are citizens of Albuquerque who believe that most of their unpleasant experiences with businesses , officials or neighbors deserve a news story .
I know .
They call me all the time .
And I 'm glad they do , because sometimes , they 're right .
But over the years I 've come to notice that it takes a certain mindset to believe that what 's happening to you is a ) wrong , b ) someone 's fault and c ) something other people should know about .
It 's not just a privilege of access .
It 's deeper than that .
That 's just an example from my backyard .
Globally , media suffers mightily without the trust of the people it needs to serve .
Those with access and a sense of entitlement end up in our pages and on our screens .
Those without will wonder what the hell a reporter 's doing in their neighborhood .
There 's a super cool news site out to counterbalance this one - sidedness .
Newamericamedia.org 's motto is " Expanding the News Lens Through Ethnic Media . "
The reporting is solid , the story ideas are fresh and the perspective is more than necessary .
" NAM is dedicated to bringing the voices of the marginalized — ethnic minorities , immigrants , young people , elderly — into the national discourse , " says the About Us section .
And it 's about time .
Jack Brimberg and Bill Hurley of The Royal Military College of Canada , Kingston , Ontario , point out that sports commentators will often argue the importance of scoring the first goal and often suggest that a team improves its chances of winning considerably by scoring it .
This kind of punditry more commonly arises during playoff games which tend to be played more defensively .
However , although the total number of goals scored in a soccer or hockey match is usually small , Brimberg and Hurley wanted to find out whether that first goal is all important or not .
They have done this by calculating the probability of the first - goal team winning at discrete points in the match after the first goal is scored based on the number of minutes remaining in the game .
They also take overtime into account to adjust the weighting on their formula appropriately .
Team X is playing team Y . Team X scores first and there are T minutes left in regulation time .
They then assume that goal scoring follows the law of statistics known as a Poisson distribution , which for hockey and soccer it does .
Scoring in other sports , such as tennis and baseball follow a different set of statistical rules as there are different scoring factors and more " goals " scored in a match .
Therefore , the number of goals scored , N , follows the Poisson pattern and has a probability of a certain number being scored in total by both sides of " lambda " .
If both teams are playing hard , to win , then there is an equal chance of them scoring after that first goal .
However , there are factors such as league position and seasonal performance to take into account , so each of those has a parameter in the final formula .
The formula breaks down as follows :
From the first whistle , team X has a 50:50 chance of winning .
However , if the team scores at just 5 minutes of play , with 55 minutes left to play in the first period of a hockey match , then the team 's chances rise to 7 to 3 ( 70 % ) .
However , if they score the first goal much later in the game , with say , 25 minutes remaining in the second period , then their chances of winning the match rises to 4 to 1 ( 80 % ) .
Of course , probability and statistics are notoriously difficult to pin down in real life , so it is best to take any such mathematical punditry with a pinch of salt when watching the fortunes or misfortunes of your team .
That applies whether you 're catching the Toronto Maple Leafs in hockey or your flight of fancy is The Newcastle Magpies in soccer .
The researchers ' ultimate aim is not to see sports pundits out of a job , but to provide an interesting example of how statistics problems might be taught in the classroom .
The current example requires explanation and understanding of several important topics in statistics , they explain , including the exponential , Poisson , and binomial distributions , probability trees , and the use of conditioning to calculate complex probabilities .
No matter .
For Republicans , it makes much more sense to focus their disdain on the speaker rather than Mr. Obama , who remains very popular .
They cannot afford to attack him too harshly because any assault could easily boomerang , especially since Mr. Obama has been openly reaching out to Republicans .
And by trying to associate themselves with the president , Republicans also hope to create a perception of some distance between the White House and the Democratic Congress , a gap Republicans would like to wedge themselves into .
From Ms. Pelosi ’s vantage point , the Republican strategy is simply evidence of their own failures .
“ To the extent that they have attacked me , it is because House Democrats have been so successful in working with President Obama to bring the change that America so desperately needs , ” Ms. Pelosi said in comments provided by her office .
“ It does n’t bother me  I ’m in the arena . ”
Ms. Pelosi and Republicans have frequently clashed over the past two years , with the speaker showing little patience for what she sees as obstructionism and game - playing , and with them bridling at both her ideological bent and leadership style .

But the fact is that while Ms. Pelosi ’s liberalism might have a bit more of a San Francisco edge to it than Mr. Obama ’s progressivism , the two share plenty of common philosophical ground and have similar policy goals .
House Democrats may have stuffed a few clunkers into the $ 787 billion economic stimulus legislation crafted under Ms. Pelosi ’s direction , but Mr. Obama was totally on board with the vast majority of the bill .

BBC News , Bogota
Farc loses arms and ammunition in raids , but is far from defeat The Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia ( Farc ) are celebrating their 45th anniversary , making them one of the oldest insurgent forces in the world - and , despite recent setbacks , still one of the strongest .
" The Farc are at their worst point in 45 years of fighting , " said Alfredo Rangel , head of the Bogota think - tank Security and Democracy .
" Up until recently they had always been growing , in numbers and territory .
Now they are being driven back , and their numbers are falling .
They are in terminal decline . "
Yet while the Tamil Tigers , one of the most brutal and innovative insurgencies , are crushed and the Nepalese Maoists opt for the political route ( at least for the moment ) , the Farc remain committed to their increasingly improbable aim of overthrowing the state and imposing a socialist regime .
Its members are motivated neither by religion or ethnicity .
The Farc are a throwback to the 1960s , when Cuban - inspired insurgent groups sprang up in South and then Central America .
Battered
And they are pretty much all that remain of those insurgencies that swept through Latin America .
They have recently taken a battering , reduced from almost 16,000 fighters in 2002 to half that today , with a record 3,000 deserting ranks in 2008 .
Last year their founder and legendary leader , Manuel " Sureshot " Marulanda , died of a heart attack aged 78 .
Two other members of the Farc 's ruling body , the Secretariat , were killed , one in an aerial bombardment of a rebel camp in neighbouring Ecuador , another murdered by his own bodyguard , who cut off a hand to show the authorities and claim a reward .
The Farc leader , known as Alfonso Cano , has launched " Plan Rebirth " .
Yet the Farc are far from defeated .
They have new leaders , including a bespectacled and bearded anthropologist known by the alias Alfonso Cano , long the movement 's ideologue , a committed Marxist Leninist and hardliner .
He has now established his control over the movement , since the death last March of Marulanda , and delivered his new strategy for the rebels , called Plan Rebirth .
The Farc have stepped up their campaign , with more attacks so far this year than any year since 2003 .
And the rebels are trying to move away from their peasant roots and project themselves into Colombia 's cities , aided by training from international groups like the Provisional IRA and the Basque separatist group Eta .
Cocaine
The Farc 's communique celebrating their 45th anniversary was defiant and optimistic .
" The decisive stage of the fight for peace has begun , " read the message posted on the internet .
" We have sworn to win and win we will . "
Much of the Farc 's longevity , certainly since the mid-1980s , can be attributed to one thing : cocaine .
Whilst the Farc are ultra conservative in their doctrine and tactics , they have proven themselves to be adept businessmen , latching onto the drugs trade and taking their cut from all the links in the narcotics chain , from the coca fields up to the vacuum - packed bricks of cocaine that leave Colombia 's shores at a rate of over 600 tonnes a year .
According to Roman Ortiz , security expert at the Ideas for Peace Foundation , the drugs trade has provided more than just overflowing coffers .
" The Farc have also inherited a support base from their involvement in the drugs trade , " said Mr Ortiz .
" They get support and recruits from the peasants who cultivate and harvest the drug crops . "
Out of reach The Farc have two other crucial advantages which they maximise : topography perfectly suited to guerrilla warfare , and long borders with nations not interested in , or unable to crack down on , rebel activity .
Colombia could not have been designed any better for an insurgent force .
It has three mountains ranges that trisect the country and the lower levels are coated in dense jungle .
Like the Taliban in Pakistan and the Vietcong in Cambodia , the Farc use the border regions , mostly impenetrable jungle , to rest and recuperate , plan attacks and get supplies and weapons , all out of reach of the Colombian security forces .
Intelligence sources indicate that four members of the Secretariat now reside outside Colombia .
There have long been accusations , vehemently denied , that President Hugo Chavez of Venezuela sympathises with the Farc .
What is clear is that the Farc have camps on Venezuelan soil and many of their supplies come from here and from Ecuador .
The latter uses the US dollar as its currency , meaning that the dollars that come into rebel coffers from the US drugs market can be readily translated into food , medical supplies , uniforms and black - market arms and munitions .
" We have incontrovertible evidence that elements of the Venezuelan military not only turn a blind eye to Farc presence on their soil , but actively help them with weapons and logistics , " said a senior intelligence figure in the Colombian defence ministry .
" As long as this continues , our chances of a military victory are slim . "
Leaner and meaner
Other borders are with Panama , which has no army ;
Peru , still unable to defeat the remnants of its own rebel force , the Shining Path ; and Brazil , whose border sweeps into the Amazon basin , where visibility is reduced to a few metres amid the triple - canopy jungle .
And under orders to recruit quality not quantity , the Farc are becoming leaner and meaner .
The money from drugs continues , whereas the tax revenues the state needs to keep the US - backed military machine on the offensive are shrinking thanks to the world financial crisis .
President Alvaro Uribe , who may well stand for a third term in office , assuming he can change the constitution once again , has shown no desire to negotiate with the rebels , who killed his father in a botched kidnap attempt .
The Farc celebrate their 45th anniversary secure in the knowledge that it will not be their last .

Listening to users considered harmful ?
Is " listening to users " really the most important way to keep them happy and -- if we 're lucky -- passionate ?
Is giving users what they ask for the best way to help them kick ass ?
Or should you create or modify a product based solely on what you believe in ... even if it does n't match what users tell you ?
Last weekend I attended the sold - out Parelli Natural Horsemanship conference .
I was surrounded by 2000 passionate fans ( at least 75 % of the people were wearing at least one Parelli - branded shirt , jacket , or hat ) .
The conference was amazing ( more on that in another post ) , but the real reason I went was to interview the founder / visionary Pat Parelli , for the Creating Passionate Users book .
His hugely successful , multi-million dollar company is one of the few we 've found that does virtually everything on our " reverse - engineering passion " checklists , without having first waited for the fans to do it themselves .
In the equestrian world ( total annual impact of the horse industry on the US economy is $ 112 billion [ yes , that 's with a " b " ] ) , Pat Parelli has so greatly outstripped the " horsemanship " competition that it does n't even make sense to talk about competition .
Software engineers will appreciate that horse training does n't scale .
So Parelli decided to teach others to do what he does , and of course sell those folks a ton of high - end equipment and training products to help them do it .
Nobody -- absolutely no other individual " horse whisperer " or company -- comes anywhere near Parelli in size and scope of the business - Parelli has two training centers , one in Colorado and one in Florida ( combined over 700 acres for the facilities ) , and hundreds of thousands of participants in the home - study programs , clinics , and club membership .
Their Parelli Horseman 's University is one of the only state - accredited " natural horsemanship " programs in the US .
So that 's the backstory .
I have weeks ' worth of posts to make on what I learned from Pat about the ways in which they 've become such a passionate user success story , but today 's post is about something I had completely wrong when I interviewed him :
Me : " So , you 've recently made drastic changes to your program - - a program that was already extremely successful .
It 's obvious that you 've been really listening to your members and taking their feedback and using that to make these sweeping changes . "
Pat : " No , listening to our members was maybe 20 % of it , but the other 80 % was something else . "
And then he said it :
" We changed our entire program because WE knew we could do better .
Because WE were still frustrated that people were n't learning quickly enough or progressing through the higher levels as well as we thought they could .
People still were n't having the kind of relationship with their horse that we knew they could have , even though our students were delighted with the progress they were making .
So we changed it all . "
It turned out that most of the major changes they made to their program came not from user requests and suggestions , but from the Parelli team 's own innovations .
He went on to explain that their members / students / users had no idea what was needed to make better , faster , deeper breakthroughs .
In fact , many of the changes went against what their user feedback seemed to suggest .
In other words , in many ways the Parelli team deliberately did not listen to users .
They trusted themselves , and did what they believed was right for their users , even if it meant doing things that on the surface seemed even less user - friendly .
Most of us realize that focus groups are notoriously ineffective for many things , but we still assume that listening to real feedback from real users is the best way to drive new products and services , as well as improve on what we have .
But there 's a huge problem with that -- people do n't necessarily know how to ask for something they 've never conceived of !
Most people make suggestions based entirely around incremental improvements , looking at what exists and thinking about how it could be better .
But that 's quite different from having a vision for something profoundly new .
True innovation will rarely come from what users say directly .
This does n't mean that you do n't listen to users -- because the truth is embedded in what they say ... but you have to look for the deeper meaning behind what they ask for , rather than always taking them at their word .
If they ask for " D " , as an improvement to " C " , you might have to dig deeper to find out what it is about " D " that they want .
And in that answer , you might find the nugget that leads you -- and only you -- to come up with " S " as a solution .
And the " S " solution looks nothing at all like " D " , but gets to the heart of what users really wanted and needed when they asked for " D " .
In the end , you might have to trust yourself , even in the face of users who either want more than you know would be good or something less or different than you know you can offer if you keep innovating in revolutionary -- not just incremental - - ways .
Our Head
First books are among the top - selling computer books today , virtually all of them occupy the # 1 slot for their topic category .
But not only did nobody ask for such a bizarre format for a technical book , we were warned that it would never work .
We were told that people would hate these books .
That they were too different , too pictorial , too ... tacky to be taken seriously .
But we knew the brain science and learning theory behind the format , and trusted that the principles worked .
That for most ( not all ) readers , this format really did lead to faster , deeper learning .
We trusted that people would look beyond the surface aspects of the implementation , and that if they got real results from the book , they 'd tell others .
Two other publishers turned us down for the series before O'Reilly took the chance .
And I was nearly fired from Sun for trying to sneak 5 % of what 's in Head First into Sun courseware .
Are users / readers too clueless to know what to ask for ?
Of course not .
But it 's not a potential Java programmer 's job to be a learning theory expert , anymore than I could have helped conceive of the iPod .
I could make incremental suggestions about most of the tools I use , sure , but I do n't have the background , skills , or vision to suggest the kind of revolutionary changes that create breakthrough products and services outside of my own very narrow domain .
What sparked this post was a somewhat contentious ( and bold ) 37 Signals post , but I also remembered this post by Wiley editor Joe Wilcox .
This is tricky , of course , because it 's not always obvious which user complaints / suggestions are based on real problems with your product , vs. naive feature requests that would do more harm than good .
( Do n't forget the Happy User Curve )
And this is NOT about giving them simply what we know is good for them but that they really do n't want , because they probably wo n't stick around .
This is about giving them what they really DO want ... but simply do n't realize it because they had no way to imagine it .
So maybe the key is to listen not only to what users say , but more importantly to what is motivating what they say .
The rest is up to us .
If we really care about our users , they 'll just have to trust us ... but more crucially -- we have to trust ourselves .

Though distilling customer requirements into real products has always been the role of marketing .

This is exactly what the book " innovator 's Dilemma " is about .

Great book I highly recommend it .

That 's exactly what I mean about searching the noise .
Not the user feedback noise , but any noise .
Passion starts before you design a product , before you show up for work in the morning .
It even starts before you eat breakfast , get out of bed , or shake last nights dream out of your mind .
Passion is your destiny .
You can buy the uniform , stitch on all the badges and recite the pledge , but unless you are already passionate about what you do without the recognition , your improvement is going to be incremental .
This movie Contact is all about this .
Ellie ( Jodie Foster ) does not find traditional incremental improvements of astronomy acceptable , and she is rewarded Passionate User style buy an eccentric billionaire who understands passion when he sees it and by an alien intelligence .
The Wright brothers threw all the incremental research pertaining to flight out the window , and as uneducated high school drop outs exceeded the progress of the greatest minds in the world .
What they did not do , is read Kathy 's blog , which would have taught them how to nurture the passion of the following they created , their users , and obtain even greater heights with their wind .
Posted by : Shaded | Sep 16 , 2005 8:19:10 AM
I always use this example ...
150 year ago , when asked what they needed , farmers might have asked for bigger , stronger horses or maybe more horses .
None of them would have thought to ask for a tractor .
IDEO , one of the worlds best design organizations , relies more heavily on observation of users actually using products instead of asking them questions .
Not only do people not know what they want ( or what 's possible ) they tend to answer in ways that hide the fact that they had difficulty in a ( subconscious ) attempt to not look stupid .
For example , people that struggle with a particular UI element for several minutes might report that they found it intuitive in order to not feel ( appear ) stupid .
User feedback is important but it does n't always mean what it appears to mean .
At the risk of sounding repetitive and predictable , great post .

This post is dead on , and I thought it may be useful to point out an example of an effective way to listen to customers .
Mark Hurst provides an example here : http://www.goodexperience.com/blog/archives/000324.php
" In our non-directed listening labs , we ask customers to use the Internet in the way they normally use it at home or work .
While we do have a goal for the research , we try to let the customers lead us to the answer , rather than the other way around . "
Posted by : Eric | Sep 16 , 2005 11:04:24 AM
OK , I 'll take that risk of sounding repetitive ... great post !
This all reinforces the point of how authenticity and transparency are so frickin ' important in the marketing AND innovation process .
It 's still really difficult for users to accept that they are not being bullshat upon .
The passion of the innovators and the execution of that passion , however , can trump any marketing plan .
What Kathy states so well is that there is process to the marketing side that old - school marketers rarely , if ever , take into consideration .

Every time I read articles saying that user research is a panacea , I remeber the funny art project " The Most Wanted Paintings " , by Komar & Melamid .
They answered the question : how art would be if guided by user surveys ?
They have a nice site displaying the terrible paintings based in these surveys .
Hollywood blockbusters suffer a lot from it .
How many mainstream movies would be better without a happy ending , or explaing too much , killing all serendipity .
I believe they do user testing in pre-screen sessions , and 15 % think the movie is too dificult , or too sad , so they change it to please everybody .
Gilberto Gil , a great brazilian musician and the country current minister of culture , has a verse that says : " The people knows what they want , but the people also wants what they do n't know " .

User studies are n't much good for innovating .
They are good , however , for making sure that the your design actually works .
The user is n't " writing " the design so much as proofreading what you 've already created .
I 've always had a sneaking suspicion that most user testing is done for one of two reasons :
1 ) To provide a plausible rationalization for doing what the designer already knows they need to do .
2 ) To make the design process seem less appealing for meddling managers and hangers - on who feel their business expertise translates directly into usability expertise .
From their perspective designing things looks easy and fun .
They want to stay and help .
User testing looks boring and intimdating .
They remember they have other things to do .

Another great post , Kathy .
It goes against the grain of what you usually post and my brain was not expecting it . :)
Your mention of focus groups reminds me of " The Apprentice " .
Usually the team that wins is the one that uses focus groups .
But I think this is because the teams are given tasks in industries that they 've never worked in before .
They have no clue what the users need because the team members have never gone through the frustrations that the users have experienced .
Great innovation blossoms from the belief that what we 've got just is n't good enough .
I recently heard that Nintendo is completely redesigning their controllers .
This is a perfect example of not listening to the users .
Users demanded better graphics and the gaming industry acted accordingly .
Now the gaming community complains that the games look great but are n't as fun as the games of long ago .
I think Nintendo discovered on their own that the better graphics demanded better interactivity .
If a game can make me feel like I 'm on a battlefield I do n't want to shoot my gun by pressing ' A ' .
On the original Super Mario Brothers we forced our own interactivity into the game by leaning when Mario ran or jumped ( some people even bounced a little ) .
We HAD to use our imaginations .
The comparison of old games vs new [ SMACKDOWN !] is much like that of books vs TV .
Our interactivity used to come from imagination but now that the experience has " improved " with visuals and sounds ... well , we need something else to keep our brains stimulated .
What we 've got now just is n't good enough .

A great post .
To innovate , we must go beyond what the users say .

Kathy -
I 'd like to take slight issue with your post .
In your opening ' graph you ask , " Should you create or modify a product based solely on what you believe in ... even if it does n't match what users tell you ? "
I do n't think that discounting user feedback is what Pat Parelli did .
I think the key distinction I want to make here is that users " tell " you what they want in any number of ways .
This is a fine point , but I believe it is essential .
Making feature requests , sending cards and emails , talking to developers ... these are ways of communicating .
But so is switching products , not upgrading your software , or even , in Parelli 's view , not learning fast enough or having a deep enough relationship with your horse .
Listening to your users means not just listening to what they say , but listening to what they do .
You report Pat Parelli as saying " WE were still frustrated that people were n't learning quickly enough or progressing through the higher levels as well as we thought they could . "
That 's key : " as well as WE thought they could . "
To me , it seems that this has nothing to do with ignoring user requests ; it has to do with paying attention to user behavior .
Parelli's insight came from listening to his users on a deep level , listening beyond the words and accolades .
Parelli kept his vision of user success firmly in mind , paid attention to the actual results his users were achieving , and changed his approach accordingly .
THAT is what I call paying attention to user feedback .
I guess that 's how I 'd wish you would reframe your point :
You 've always got to listen to your users , but sometimes you 've got to listen beyond the words .

When I developing software for Blue Cross I wrote a project development methodology .
It was not ( and is not ) focused on project management , but a pre-project innovation .
The term I coined for what you are discussing is " The Myth Of Limitation " .
Several comments above a reader speaks about farmers not knowing to ask for a tractor - this is a great analogy .
It is not that we should not listen to clients / users but we should not let their limited understanding of what is possible , limit where the solution / software / project can go .
It is important to listen and draw additional information into the open .
In this way , we can discover what is truly desired but never contemplated from the client 's perspective .
The chapter on this methodology became the longest chapter of my book with Cisco Press , The IT Career Builder 's Toolkit .
It is a critical factor across many disciplines and specialties in Information Technology .
I 'm glad I stumbled across this blog .
I think I 'll showcase you on my blog at IT Toolbox .
Thanks ,

Or as Nathaniel Borenstein put it ( in his great little book Programming As If People Mattered ) : " Listen to your users , but ignore what they say . "

The comments about listening to what the users are saying , what they 're not saying , and how it 's being said reminds me of the quote by Claude Debussy , " Music is the silence between the notes . "

I think there 's a difference between normative desires and technical desires .
A company / organization can guide the vision of a product through normative changes and this makes sense , it 's THEIR product and they have the most expertise on it .
But there 's a technical aspect to the product , the logistics , the execution of distribution , marketing , and selling is a different field .
This is the consumer 's specialty , they are the ones best aware of what good customer service looks like , buying and interacting with companies is the consumer 's expertise .
So while I agree with the premise of this post , let 's not paint too broad a brush here .

Only the retarded offspring of a village idiot and a TV weather girl would assume that " listening to users " is the same as " bowing down and licking the soles of your user 's feet and then obeying their every command " .
Listening to users is essential .
Understanding their real needs and desires ( which may not be stated explicitly in short bullet - point format ) is both a skill to be mastered and a critical detail .
Smart people generally know how to do their job , what they want to do , and what would make them happy .
What they * do n't * know is how to achieve that - we need to listen to them , understand them , and then keep up our end of the bargain by giving them something great .
Listening to users does n't mean abdicating responsibility for design and implementation to the users .

Although unpopular like an excerpt out of Bertrand Russell 's ' Unpopular Essays ' , what determines the first success of a product is merely its marketing .
A product can be as bad as hell : if you obsessively bring it before the attention of the public , the public shall buy it .
Simply .
They buy everything , as long as you can enter their attention scope .
In a scale economy , it 's not really a matter of quality : it 's a matter of noise in order to pick from the big numbers .
No matter how disagreeable this fact may be , it 's still a fact .
A product can be good or very good .
If it has no funds for marketing , no one will ever consider it - they may even mock at it .
It is true that you can't sell a non working product for long , but you can definitely sell for how long as you want ( lawsuits allowing ) a barely working one provided you have more money to invest in its publicity than you had to invest in its making .
The outcome is that who has money , will have more money also churning out lower products , and who puts all her / his efforts in a decent product , will have less money than she / he had at the onset , with no return .
